25
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:45,004
(Thank you
for making me dinner, darling)

26
00:01:57,332 --> 00:01:58,132
This is good, too.

27
00:02:18,091 --> 00:02:18,932
Hello, there.

28
00:02:24,411 --> 00:02:25,172
Fever gone?

29
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:27,292
I think so.

30
00:02:28,531 --> 00:02:30,251
But it may come back at night.

31
00:02:32,332 --> 00:02:34,612
Should we go to the hospital?

32
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:40,052
No need. It happens once or twice
every year. I'll be fine tomorrow.

33
00:02:42,732 --> 00:02:48,251
You sweated a lot. Should I
turn on the AC? You may get a cold.

34
00:02:49,571 --> 00:02:51,411
No, it's okay. Thanks.

35
00:02:54,052 --> 00:02:56,292
Are you thirsty? Or hungry?

36
00:02:58,012 --> 00:03:00,971
I'm just going to the bathroom.

37
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:04,332
Go ahead.

38
00:03:27,892 --> 00:03:31,691
Are you hungry? It's four o'clock.
Should I get a takeout?

39
00:03:35,411 --> 00:03:42,292
Or I can cook. I'm not much of a chef,
but I can make rice porridge.

40
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:45,811
Do you like those snacks?

41
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:52,251
Yeah, they're good.

42
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:56,932
Which one do you like?
I'll get more of them next time.

43
00:03:58,131 --> 00:04:00,612
The chicken feet. And the pork jerky.

44
00:04:02,531 --> 00:04:07,811
Forget it. I'll bring some snacks
and food from our supermarket.

45
00:04:07,811 --> 00:04:09,571
Okay, let me pay.

46
00:04:10,851 --> 00:04:11,651
No need.

47
00:04:13,492 --> 00:04:16,932
Sit a bit. I'll go lie down.
I'm still dizzy.

48
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:37,092
You sweated a lot. Have some water.

49
00:04:37,092 --> 00:04:38,771
Okay, thank you.

50
00:04:53,211 --> 00:04:54,011
I think you're fine.

51
00:04:56,092 --> 00:04:56,932
Your hair clipper.

52
00:04:58,092 --> 00:04:58,732
Let me help.

53
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:13,612
- Done.
- Thanks.

54
00:05:18,211 --> 00:05:20,052
It's stuck on my watch.

55
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:23,251
Don't move. Let me get it off.

56
00:05:37,532 --> 00:05:38,052
Wait.

57
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:51,972
It hurts?

58
00:05:56,771 --> 00:05:57,652
Stay still.

59
00:06:03,052 --> 00:06:03,652
Almost done.

60
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:18,691
Should we turn on the light first?

61
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:23,652
Should I close the door for you?

62
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:25,811
Turn on the light.

63
00:06:32,371 --> 00:06:33,211
Are you okay?

64
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:35,972
I'm fine.

65
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:37,891
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:40,451 --> 00:06:41,512
You finished the script?

67
00:06:41,512 --> 00:06:44,332
Yeah, I'm looking for something to eat.

68
00:06:44,332 --> 00:06:47,891
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have disrupted you.

69
00:06:53,811 --> 00:06:56,092
He's been here all along?

70
00:06:58,172 --> 00:06:58,612
Yeah.

71
00:07:00,011 --> 00:07:05,104
You came here,
so I texted him to stay in his room.

72
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:09,168
I didn't want you to be awkward.

73
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:13,732
I'm a good boy. I wouldn't come out
if I weren't starving.

74
00:07:15,292 --> 00:07:20,292
We were talking about what to eat.
Let's have dinner together.

75
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:23,952
Mo, can I join you?

76
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:26,011
As long as you want to.

77
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:29,732
Alright, then. Thank you.

78
00:07:35,612 --> 00:07:41,532
Let's have rice porridge. You have rice,
right? I'll make some light dishes.

79
00:07:43,571 --> 00:07:45,732
I want steamed beef with rice flour.

80
00:07:48,691 --> 00:07:50,451
(I don't know how to make it.)

81
00:07:50,451 --> 00:07:53,932
Aren't you supposed to
have something light?

82
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:54,932
Okay?

83
00:07:57,251 --> 00:08:00,131
Next time, okay? You're having a fever.

84
00:08:01,852 --> 00:08:04,251
I have the ingredients ready.

85
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:10,352
My fever is gone. Let me cook for you.

86
00:08:10,352 --> 00:08:11,812
Alright, alright.

87
00:08:11,812 --> 00:08:17,571
You should eat light. You're a doctor.
You should know that. Talk to him.

88
00:08:18,732 --> 00:08:21,532
I can't cook.
I'll be grateful no matter who cooks.

89
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:28,052
- Let me. But you can't have too much.
- Okay.

90
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:36,012
This one?

91
00:08:36,012 --> 00:08:36,971
I think so.

92
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:42,091
It's frozen. How do we cook it?
Shouldn't we defrost it?

93
00:08:44,132 --> 00:08:47,732
Shall we heat it in the microwave oven?

94
00:08:47,732 --> 00:08:49,531
I don't think so.

95
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:51,611
It will be defrosted in a minute.

96
00:08:53,892 --> 00:08:56,932
Then the meat will lose texture.

97
00:08:56,932 --> 00:08:58,992
So what do we do?

98
00:08:58,992 --> 00:09:03,491
Keep it in the plastic bag
and leave it in cold water.

99
00:09:24,252 --> 00:09:25,611
He's got everything.

100
00:09:26,851 --> 00:09:31,052
He could have been a great chef
instead of a doctor.

101
00:09:31,052 --> 00:09:34,491
But he can't make
a habit into a job, right?

102
00:09:35,691 --> 00:09:36,852
I guess.

103
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:39,691
You know what? Mo...

104
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:45,532
We're waiting for it to defrost.

105
00:09:45,532 --> 00:09:46,571
We're not slacking off.

106
00:09:53,892 --> 00:09:55,031
It's not ready?

107
00:09:55,031 --> 00:09:57,331
Yeah, it's only been ten minutes.

108
00:10:20,851 --> 00:10:23,851
Check it out. Three-star Michelin chef.

109
00:10:36,611 --> 00:10:39,811
Baking soda. Cooking wine.
And chopsticks, please.

110
00:10:41,052 --> 00:10:43,112
Baking soda.

111
00:10:43,112 --> 00:10:44,052
Chopsticks.

112
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,132
Okay, thank you.

113
00:10:58,292 --> 00:10:58,971
Flavored water.

114
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:01,132
Flavored water.

115
00:11:01,132 --> 00:11:02,212
Flavored water.

116
00:11:02,212 --> 00:11:07,091
I don't know where that is.
He runs the kitchen here.

117
00:11:07,091 --> 00:11:08,532
It's over there.

118
00:11:12,012 --> 00:11:16,012
This one? I see scallions.
I think that's it.

119
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,411
When did you make it?

120
00:11:21,411 --> 00:11:22,412
At noon.

121
00:11:24,172 --> 00:11:26,472
Weren't you having a fever?

122
00:11:26,472 --> 00:11:29,211
I was craving it,
so I prepared it in advance.

123
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:31,772
Oyster sauce. Soy sauce.

124
00:11:33,012 --> 00:11:35,851
- Oyster sauce.
- Here.

125
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:40,851
- Soybean paste. And oil.
- Alright.

126
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:49,132
Mix them.

127
00:11:57,532 --> 00:11:59,332
Do you need me here?

128
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:00,412
Not really.

129
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:06,252
I'll take my medicine. Watch the time.

130
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:12,971
Marinate it for ten minutes.
Call me when it's ready.

131
00:12:18,172 --> 00:12:22,864
Thank goodness you're here.
I'm starting to be convinced that

132
00:12:22,864 --> 00:12:25,200
I'm benefiting the most
from your relationship.

133
00:12:25,391 --> 00:12:29,532
I'd be helping him with cooking
if you weren't here.

134
00:12:30,772 --> 00:12:32,132
I don't cook very well.

135
00:12:32,132 --> 00:12:36,132
It doesn't matter. He's a genius chef.
That's what matters.

136
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:40,432
He gets the meat and greens he likes
when we go for the groceries.

137
00:12:40,432 --> 00:12:44,911
Then he finds recipes and studies them.

138
00:12:44,911 --> 00:12:48,971
He gets the ingredients first
and then looks for recipes?

139
00:12:50,691 --> 00:12:53,352
What a fancy foodie.

140
00:12:53,352 --> 00:12:57,772
You don't get it. He's not "fancy".
He's "superb". Okay?

141
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:03,252
- We'll have rice porridge.
- Okay.

142
00:13:04,932 --> 00:13:05,831
Where's the rice?

143
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:06,811
Over there.

144
00:13:09,772 --> 00:13:12,372
You know the kitchen better than me now.

145
00:13:30,211 --> 00:13:30,932
Well, Sheng.

146
00:13:32,451 --> 00:13:35,372
Do you know about
that "repost" incident a few years ago?

147
00:13:37,372 --> 00:13:43,312
Of course, that's his only scandal.
And they keep bringing it up.

148
00:13:43,312 --> 00:13:50,172
Someone lost his pet and asked him
to repost, but it was a fraud.

149
00:13:50,172 --> 00:13:54,712
He deleted the repost and apologized,
but they kept saying that

150
00:13:54,712 --> 00:13:59,611
he had planned the whole thing
for money, fame, attention,

151
00:13:59,611 --> 00:14:00,451
and...

152
00:14:05,012 --> 00:14:08,976
Fame brought him unwanted attention.

153
00:14:08,976 --> 00:14:12,656
I felt so sorry for him back then.

154
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,611
The netizens cursed him for three months
but even doxxed him.

155
00:14:17,611 --> 00:14:23,372
Yeah, he didn't want to implicate
the hospital and his patients.

156
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:27,692
So he dropped out for three years.

157
00:14:27,692 --> 00:14:29,191
What a pity.

158
00:14:29,191 --> 00:14:33,872
I still can't read DMs
because of what happened to him.

159
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:39,412
I ignore all those posts mentioning me
because I don't want any trouble.

160
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:43,432
It's the same for Mo.
He's ignoring all the gossip.

161
00:14:43,432 --> 00:14:51,052
That's hatred brewed by jealousy.
And it's irrational, isn't it?

162
00:14:51,052 --> 00:14:58,772
So we'd better leave it to time
and ignore those people online, right?

163
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:06,372
- Are you consolidating me?
- Yeah.

164
00:15:13,292 --> 00:15:14,772
It wasn't very pleasant

165
00:15:17,372 --> 00:15:18,652
to read those at first.

166
00:15:20,012 --> 00:15:25,851
I never had so many fans.
No one knew me. I was nobody.

167
00:15:25,851 --> 00:15:29,691
So many people started cursing me
out of the blue.

168
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:34,172
I wasn't used to it.

169
00:15:35,772 --> 00:15:36,731
I'll get over it.

170
00:15:39,691 --> 00:15:42,571
And I forgot about it
once I heard that he got sick.

171
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:50,391
Good for you. Those people hide behind
their screens and spread rumors all day.

172
00:15:50,391 --> 00:15:53,012
The best way to deal with them
is to ignore them.

173
00:15:55,811 --> 00:15:56,851
Let me see.

174
00:15:59,331 --> 00:16:02,971
Should we cook
some mushrooms with greens?

175
00:16:04,091 --> 00:16:06,711
Alright, as long as you don't
mind my cooking skills.

176
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,731
I bet you're better than me.

177
00:16:09,932 --> 00:16:11,732
Good luck. I'll be in my room.

178
00:16:11,732 --> 00:16:12,491
Alright.

179
00:16:18,372 --> 00:16:24,811
Steamed beef. Mushrooms with greens.
Recipes. Let me find the recipes.

180
00:16:31,731 --> 00:16:32,292
It's dead.

181
00:16:53,772 --> 00:16:55,012
It's ready?

182
00:16:55,012 --> 00:17:01,451
No, my phone died. I want to search
for the recipes. May I use your PC?

183
00:17:03,611 --> 00:17:05,092
Use my tablet. It's easier.

184
00:17:19,731 --> 00:17:22,891
Don't get out of bed so often.
You may get worse.

185
00:17:22,891 --> 00:17:27,132
My fever is gone. It's only
my throat hurting. So it's fine.

186
00:17:28,812 --> 00:17:31,652
I couldn't get out of bed all day
when I had a fever.

187
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:42,691
I once worked all night right after
the fever was gone.

188
00:17:44,491 --> 00:17:47,691
Didn't your parents feel sorry for you?

189
00:17:49,011 --> 00:17:53,932
Not really. A liver transplant surgeon
and a cardiac surgeon.

190
00:17:53,932 --> 00:17:59,812
It'd be lucky if they could meet
once a week for dinner.

191
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:03,291
So they didn't feel for me.

192
00:18:08,211 --> 00:18:08,771
Found it?

193
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:17,172
Add ground rice flour to beef
and mix them well.

194
00:18:17,172 --> 00:18:23,760
Place them on steamer.
Steam on a big fire for 12 minutes.

195
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:25,360
Is that right?

196
00:18:27,211 --> 00:18:30,572
The ground rice flour
is next to the flavored water.

197
00:18:47,852 --> 00:18:51,971
Thank you for making me dinner, darling.

198
00:18:58,691 --> 00:18:59,852
Thanks for keeping me company.

199
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:07,971
I just don't want you
to be alone at home.

200
00:19:09,932 --> 00:19:11,531
You may need help.

201
00:19:29,691 --> 00:19:32,652
Alright, I'll go cook.

202
00:20:20,731 --> 00:20:23,251
What's wrong with your eyes?

203
00:20:24,652 --> 00:20:25,531
Need an ophthalmologist?

204
00:20:26,691 --> 00:20:28,092
Let me check them for you.

205
00:20:29,332 --> 00:20:32,771
- Don't get cocky, Mr. Boyfriend.
- Are you jealous?

206
00:20:35,531 --> 00:20:36,491
Very much.

207
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:43,611
I prepared some tofu just in case
we didn't have enough dishes.

208
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:44,352
Thank you.

209
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:45,051
Chopsticks.

210
00:20:49,531 --> 00:20:52,592
Some of us are born luckier.

211
00:20:52,592 --> 00:20:53,932
Get lost.

212
00:20:55,132 --> 00:20:56,312
Have some rice porridge.

213
00:20:56,312 --> 00:20:57,832
Thank you.

214
00:20:57,832 --> 00:20:58,812
Sheng.

215
00:21:01,132 --> 00:21:01,892
Thank you.

216
00:21:06,211 --> 00:21:06,812
No problem.

217
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:09,612
Be right back.

218
00:21:14,771 --> 00:21:16,531
Mo, you're really something.

219
00:21:18,051 --> 00:21:20,332
Sheng, thank you.

220
00:21:29,691 --> 00:21:30,472
What?

221
00:21:30,472 --> 00:21:32,211
I want the first bite.

222
00:21:35,771 --> 00:21:36,531
Here we go.

223
00:21:39,612 --> 00:21:41,292
I asked for this dish.

224
00:21:41,292 --> 00:21:43,312
Why aren't you eating?

225
00:21:43,312 --> 00:21:44,912
We're talking about...

226
00:21:44,912 --> 00:21:46,892
We're talking about

227
00:21:46,892 --> 00:21:49,372
whether we should use spoons
for rice porridge and tofu.

228
00:21:50,491 --> 00:21:51,812
Oh right, let me get them.

229
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:54,892
Don't. I can't let you
do all the work. I'll go.

230
00:21:57,491 --> 00:21:59,752
Where are the spoons?

231
00:21:59,752 --> 00:22:01,251
No idea. Look around.

232
00:22:07,412 --> 00:22:09,171
He doesn't eat scallions?

233
00:22:09,171 --> 00:22:13,092
No way. He'll eat grass
if that's what you feed him.

234
00:22:16,051 --> 00:22:18,572
The steamed beef
will be ready. I'll check on it.

235
00:22:21,092 --> 00:22:22,052
Dig in.

236
00:22:22,052 --> 00:22:23,092
I'll wait for you.

237
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:36,251
There's nothing you won't say
to please your girlfriend, huh?

238
00:22:37,652 --> 00:22:41,612
But it's okay. I can eat grass.
I can eat anything you feed me.

239
00:22:43,451 --> 00:22:46,132
Someone's very talkative today.

240
00:22:47,451 --> 00:22:52,072
I've been in my room all day.
I'm happy to see all these nice dishes.

241
00:22:52,072 --> 00:22:54,111
I get talkative when I'm happy.

242
00:22:54,111 --> 00:22:57,932
I got sick and earned this meal.
Try to contain yourself.

243
00:22:58,971 --> 00:23:01,491
Fine, I will. So petty.

244
00:23:03,812 --> 00:23:07,491
Who is it? Wang Ke.
Should I invite him over?

245
00:23:11,172 --> 00:23:14,291
Okay, I'm the third wheel.
We don't need a fourth one.

246
00:23:15,491 --> 00:23:18,172
Who's Wang Ke? Your friend?
I don't know him.

247
00:23:30,932 --> 00:23:32,292
Anybody coming?

248
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:33,612
No.

249
00:23:36,812 --> 00:23:39,112
He doesn't answer.
How do we get up there?

250
00:23:39,112 --> 00:23:46,131
How would I know? Why did you have to
ride an electrocar? We're freezing here.

251
00:23:46,131 --> 00:23:48,632
Move. Let me sit a bit.

252
00:23:48,632 --> 00:23:49,412
Hey...

253
00:23:50,531 --> 00:23:55,412
Stop nagging me. Why should I drive?
Where do we park? There's a parking fee.

254
00:23:55,412 --> 00:24:00,892
And the gas? This is eco-friendly.
Charge it once and it runs for a week.

255
00:24:00,892 --> 00:24:06,132
Shut up. Why do you have so much to say?
Figure out how to get up there, okay?

256
00:24:09,852 --> 00:24:12,771
Is it inhabited?
Why isn't there anyone coming out?

257
00:24:17,291 --> 00:24:19,492
Could Mo Qingcheng pass out in his room?

258
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:20,792
No way.

259
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,372
Call the ambulance.

260
00:24:22,372 --> 00:24:26,291
Still, I don't think the medical staff
can get up there.

261
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:28,172
What do you think?

262
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,251
They can't open the door.

263
00:24:47,932 --> 00:24:49,872
Is this old man from this building?

264
00:24:49,872 --> 00:24:53,231
Of course. It's the only building here.

265
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:55,192
What if he's just walking around?

266
00:24:55,192 --> 00:24:59,832
With groceries? Look, he's getting
his keys out, right?

267
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:06,772
He's turning. Come on.
Sir, do you live here?

268
00:25:06,772 --> 00:25:08,352
Yeah.

269
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,992
Great, let me help.

270
00:25:09,992 --> 00:25:10,852
What's going on?

271
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,791
What do you want?

272
00:25:14,791 --> 00:25:19,632
Sir, please don't be mad.
Our friend lives in this building.

273
00:25:19,632 --> 00:25:23,651
He's having a fever and doesn't answer
our call, so we're worried.

274
00:25:23,651 --> 00:25:26,432
Could you please open the door for us?

275
00:25:26,432 --> 00:25:27,172
Yeah.

276
00:25:36,291 --> 00:25:38,051
What do you do? Why should I trust you?

277
00:25:52,172 --> 00:25:53,812
What's wrong with your friend?

278
00:25:57,572 --> 00:25:58,391
Where are you going?

279
00:25:58,391 --> 00:25:59,372
I'll bring the dishes.

280
00:26:01,051 --> 00:26:02,731
So considerate.

281
00:26:10,691 --> 00:26:11,251
Let me.

282
00:26:16,892 --> 00:26:17,491
Here.

283
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:21,172
Let me clean up a bit.

284
00:26:21,172 --> 00:26:25,312
No need. Come and eat.
Juemei will clean up later.

285
00:26:25,312 --> 00:26:28,892
Yeah, Ieave them for me.
I'm in charge of the cleaning.

286
00:26:28,892 --> 00:26:29,612
Alright.

287
00:26:34,291 --> 00:26:40,232
Let's thank Shengshengman
for these dishes with a toast.

288
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:42,251
Come on, that's enough. Dig in.

289
00:26:44,612 --> 00:26:46,771
Let me try the steamed beef.

290
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:50,451
Me too.

291
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,132
You sure you haven't made this before?

292
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:01,692
It's good.

293
00:27:01,692 --> 00:27:02,771
Really?

294
00:27:04,132 --> 00:27:10,051
The girlfriend of the superb foodie
is also superb. Let me try this.

295
00:27:13,852 --> 00:27:15,152
You're gifted.

296
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:19,051
Seriously,
it's pretty impressive for a new chef.

297
00:27:20,491 --> 00:27:21,592
You should eat more.

298
00:27:21,592 --> 00:27:22,572
Alright, of course.

299
00:27:22,572 --> 00:27:24,852
You're having a fever.
Have some rice porridge.

300
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:25,932
Alright.

301
00:27:25,932 --> 00:27:31,932
Your voice is so hoarse. You'd better
recover by the next anniversary event.

302
00:27:31,932 --> 00:27:33,572
Just eat. Don't talk about work.

303
00:27:33,572 --> 00:27:39,512
I got a cold some days ago and did
a check-up. Take a look at the report.

304
00:27:39,512 --> 00:27:40,852
Sure, bring it here.

305
00:27:40,852 --> 00:27:41,892
Just a second.

306
00:27:44,691 --> 00:27:46,011
Well done.

307
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:48,611
You prepared the sauce.

308
00:27:48,611 --> 00:27:50,011
The rice porridge is also nice.

309
00:27:52,332 --> 00:27:56,572
Here's the report. Take a look.
It cost me a fortune.

310
00:28:08,211 --> 00:28:08,891
What's wrong?

311
00:28:13,051 --> 00:28:14,051
You have a problem.

312
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:16,132
What is it?

313
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:26,451
You talk too much and eat too much.
You may get a fatty liver.

314
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:33,372
Sheng, he feeds me so well. I'd be lucky
if I didn't get a fatty liver, right?

315
00:28:33,372 --> 00:28:37,871
You need vegetable intake.
And have some grains.

316
00:28:37,871 --> 00:28:42,251
I did. Corn flour, grain porridge
or something when he's not home.

317
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:44,891
That's it. You're fine.

318
00:28:44,891 --> 00:28:51,792
Alright, come to think about it. Sheng,
be very careful once you marry him...

319
00:28:51,792 --> 00:28:53,172
What's wrong?

320
00:28:56,491 --> 00:29:00,052
Nothing. It's burning and I forgot.

321
00:29:00,052 --> 00:29:01,291
Slow down.

322
00:29:02,612 --> 00:29:06,051
It's burning. Cool it down for her.

323
00:29:06,051 --> 00:29:07,691
Stop talking or you'll get fatty liver.

324
00:29:11,372 --> 00:29:11,892
Who is it?

325
00:29:14,612 --> 00:29:15,251
Let me see.

326
00:29:17,771 --> 00:29:18,892
- What's wrong?
- It's you?

327
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:21,852
- Why don't you pick up?
- Shoes off.

328
00:29:21,852 --> 00:29:22,412
Seriously.

329
00:29:22,412 --> 00:29:23,812
We were worried sick.

330
00:29:23,812 --> 00:29:24,372
He...

331
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:26,491
What are you doing
behind Shengshengman's back?

332
00:29:26,491 --> 00:29:27,291
So annoying.

333
00:29:33,011 --> 00:29:34,232
Hello, Sheng.

334
00:29:34,232 --> 00:29:35,512
Hello, there.

335
00:29:35,512 --> 00:29:38,251
- We're worried about you.
- Yeah.

336
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:42,751
Have you eaten? Want to join us?

337
00:29:42,751 --> 00:29:43,691
Shall we...

338
00:29:43,691 --> 00:29:45,392
O-Okay.

339
00:29:45,392 --> 00:29:47,612
- I'll get you some rice porridge.
- No need.

340
00:29:47,612 --> 00:29:49,412
- Thanks.
- They got this.

341
00:29:56,291 --> 00:30:00,392
That's impressive. We keep running
into your girlfriend here.

342
00:30:00,392 --> 00:30:05,264
Not bad. That explains the fever.
He's faking it to lure her here.

343
00:30:05,264 --> 00:30:07,612
What a bad boy.

344
00:30:07,612 --> 00:30:11,592
I was wondering how he got sick.
He never gets sick.

345
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:14,932
Are you eating or not?

346
00:30:16,932 --> 00:30:17,892
We are.

347
00:30:20,612 --> 00:30:24,152
Wang Ke, I just washed the dishes
and you took my lane?

348
00:30:24,152 --> 00:30:25,771
Let me farm.

349
00:30:25,771 --> 00:30:27,011
But you're a support.

350
00:30:27,011 --> 00:30:28,332
I... Leave me alone.

351
00:30:30,852 --> 00:30:32,172
Zheng, nice hairstyle.

352
00:30:32,172 --> 00:30:33,251
You look good.

353
00:30:33,251 --> 00:30:34,092
So formal at home?

354
00:30:34,092 --> 00:30:36,772
Let's go to the studio.
We have work to do.

355
00:30:36,772 --> 00:30:37,611
What work?

356
00:30:37,611 --> 00:30:38,332
Urgent work.

357
00:30:38,332 --> 00:30:41,432
I'm stuffed and I washed the dishes.
I'm sitting to digest.

358
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:43,852
I said it was urgent.

359
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:48,572
Sorry about that. Sheng, see you.

360
00:30:48,572 --> 00:30:50,612
- Cut the crap.
- Take care of her.

361
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:51,971
Let me put on my shoes.

362
00:30:51,971 --> 00:30:53,332
Shut up. Take them out.

363
00:30:53,332 --> 00:30:56,412
- My bag. Wait, I left my bag in there.
- My shoes.

364
00:31:13,092 --> 00:31:14,011
Should we do something?

365
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:17,332
I don't mind.

366
00:31:22,092 --> 00:31:24,332
I'll clean up the room a bit.

367
00:31:24,332 --> 00:31:25,172
Okay.

368
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:45,132
I don't have something to entertain you.
What do you do in your spare time?

369
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:48,092
I don't know.

370
00:31:50,852 --> 00:31:57,211
I mean, nothing specific.
I just watch movies and stuff.

371
00:31:59,451 --> 00:32:01,051
I haven't watched movies
for a long time.

372
00:32:02,412 --> 00:32:03,712
Let me check the recommendations.

373
00:32:03,712 --> 00:32:04,572
No need.

374
00:32:06,892 --> 00:32:07,652
You're bored?

375
00:32:08,691 --> 00:32:14,291
No, I mean, you don't need to search.
We can just watch anything.

376
00:32:15,932 --> 00:32:18,092
Alright, then.

377
00:32:20,372 --> 00:32:20,812
Let's go.

378
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,011
We're forced to wander around.

379
00:32:30,251 --> 00:32:31,772
Look, so sweet.

380
00:32:31,772 --> 00:32:32,932
So sweet.

381
00:32:34,451 --> 00:32:38,392
They're having a nice time at home.
And we're freezing out here.

382
00:32:38,392 --> 00:32:42,052
It's going to take a while.
Let's go somewhere for fun.

383
00:32:42,052 --> 00:32:45,992
There's nowhere to go.
And I can only take one of you.

384
00:32:45,992 --> 00:32:48,712
It's not nice to dump
one of you here, right?

385
00:32:48,712 --> 00:32:50,292
Just leave the electrocar here.

386
00:32:50,292 --> 00:32:55,332
No way. It's new. What if it's stolen?
Will you make it up to me?

387
00:32:55,332 --> 00:32:57,211
Fine, stay close to your baby.

388
00:32:57,211 --> 00:32:58,712
That's what I'm doing.

389
00:32:58,712 --> 00:33:03,372
Zheng, let's get a cab to my place.
I set up a new PC.

390
00:33:04,731 --> 00:33:06,892
I'm not going there. It's too far.

391
00:33:09,011 --> 00:33:10,612
Fine, my place is too far.

392
00:33:24,291 --> 00:33:24,831
Thank you.

393
00:33:28,332 --> 00:33:30,372
(Sis, check out the photo I took.)

394
00:33:31,731 --> 00:33:32,932
(Not bad.)

395
00:33:32,932 --> 00:33:34,291
(Good, huh? Zoom in.)

396
00:33:36,731 --> 00:33:38,892
(It's weird to talk about
recipes now, right?)

397
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:41,172
(Should I find something to talk about?)

398
00:33:48,491 --> 00:33:50,892
Well, I've charged your phone.

399
00:34:02,652 --> 00:34:03,892
Let me make some warm milk tea.

400
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:47,571
Who is it?

401
00:34:47,571 --> 00:34:49,812
(Moqingcheng)
(What do you do with girls?)

402
00:34:49,812 --> 00:34:51,451
There's something Mo doesn't know?

403
00:34:52,571 --> 00:34:53,091
What's wrong?

404
00:34:58,252 --> 00:34:59,651
(Anything you want.)

405
00:35:04,451 --> 00:35:05,171
(Be serious.)

406
00:35:06,531 --> 00:35:08,452
That's so simple. Talk to her.

407
00:35:08,452 --> 00:35:09,111
Watch a movie.

408
00:35:09,111 --> 00:35:09,832
LARP games.

409
00:35:09,832 --> 00:35:10,531
Room escape.

410
00:35:10,531 --> 00:35:11,292
Or amusement park.

411
00:35:11,292 --> 00:35:12,491
So many options.

412
00:35:12,491 --> 00:35:13,312
Seriously.

413
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,472
Talk to him. Here.

414
00:35:14,472 --> 00:35:15,472
Sorry, bro.

415
00:35:15,472 --> 00:35:17,072
No, no.

416
00:35:17,072 --> 00:35:18,292
I'm just saying.

417
00:35:22,252 --> 00:35:26,852
(Talk, movie, LARP games,
room escape, or amusement park.)

418
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:28,451
(Too late for the amusement park.)

419
00:35:30,252 --> 00:35:31,311
It's getting dark.

420
00:35:31,311 --> 00:35:32,732
So picky.

421
00:35:32,732 --> 00:35:36,571
(Bro, it's getting dark.
Of course, it's too late.)

422
00:35:36,571 --> 00:35:39,852
(People get up early for that.
I'll book tickets for you next time.)

423
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:44,912
(Nothing useful.)

424
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:49,432
Zheng, you dragged us out
and he's talking to you like that?

425
00:35:49,432 --> 00:35:52,292
I wouldn't put up with it if I were you.

426
00:35:53,531 --> 00:35:54,292
Me neither.

427
00:35:54,292 --> 00:35:55,131
Call him.

428
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,183
(Incoming call: Zhou Zheng)

429
00:36:03,692 --> 00:36:05,112
What's your problem?

430
00:36:05,112 --> 00:36:08,372
It's the weekend and we're freezing
out here to secure your privacy.

431
00:36:08,372 --> 00:36:11,532
You didn't thank us and you have
a problem with my suggestions?

432
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:14,032
Thanks. That's it.

433
00:36:14,032 --> 00:36:14,852
What?

434
00:36:17,212 --> 00:36:18,112
Thanks?

435
00:36:18,112 --> 00:36:19,512
He hung up?

436
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:20,051
Yeah.

437
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:23,412
What's so funny?

438
00:36:24,531 --> 00:36:25,532
Outrageous.

439
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:26,712
Outrageous.

440
00:36:26,712 --> 00:36:29,292
I'm heading to the studio. You're free.

441
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,412
Thanks, that's what
I've been waiting for.

442
00:36:31,412 --> 00:36:33,332
- We can't just leave.
- Yeah.

443
00:36:33,332 --> 00:36:34,412
I can't carry you both.

444
00:36:34,412 --> 00:36:35,952
Feishao, let's play games.

445
00:36:35,952 --> 00:36:38,152
Get out of my sight. So annoying.

446
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:39,912
Will do.

447
00:36:39,912 --> 00:36:41,651
Tell us when you get to the studio.

448
00:37:02,451 --> 00:37:03,351
Be careful. It's hot.

449
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:04,091
Thanks.

450
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:11,272
Is it new merch? It looks so nice.

451
00:37:11,272 --> 00:37:14,932
I was their dubbing director.
I think it's only for staff.

452
00:37:17,011 --> 00:37:17,892
It's so special.

453
00:37:19,292 --> 00:37:20,651
I'll wash it. Take it home.

454
00:37:22,332 --> 00:37:24,312
I didn't mean to take it home.

455
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:26,692
I know. But you like it.

456
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:30,132
Still, I can't just take it from you.

457
00:37:30,132 --> 00:37:33,171
Don't be shy.
It's not like we're strangers.

458
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:12,712
The milk tea is so nice.

459
00:38:12,712 --> 00:38:15,272
Pack some before you leave.

460
00:38:15,272 --> 00:38:18,212
No need. Just tell me the brand.
I'll get some.

461
00:38:21,412 --> 00:38:22,772
I mean, at our supermarket.

462
00:38:23,852 --> 00:38:29,331
I should try things for our customers.
That's part of our jobs.

463
00:38:29,331 --> 00:38:33,091
You have a great reputation.
My colleagues speak highly of you.

464
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:39,912
Yeah, many retired doctors
still ask us for delivery.

465
00:38:39,912 --> 00:38:41,172
Really?

466
00:38:41,172 --> 00:38:42,652
Don't you know?

467
00:38:42,652 --> 00:38:44,091
I was transferred here.

468
00:38:45,171 --> 00:38:45,812
Okay.

469
00:39:46,332 --> 00:39:48,732
Let me find something else to eat.

470
00:40:17,812 --> 00:40:19,622
(Pork Mooncake)
Their mooncakes are famous.

471
00:40:19,622 --> 00:40:21,432
(Pork Mooncake)
They always have a long line.

472
00:40:21,432 --> 00:40:22,432
Really?

473
00:40:22,432 --> 00:40:24,212
Want some? My treat.

474
00:40:26,372 --> 00:40:28,172
But we have to wait. Is it fine?

475
00:40:28,172 --> 00:40:29,912
It's fine. It's my day off.

476
00:40:29,912 --> 00:40:31,091
Let's line up, then.

477
00:40:43,451 --> 00:40:44,051
Dad.

478
00:40:45,892 --> 00:40:47,812
Sheng.

479
00:40:49,412 --> 00:40:50,091
Sheng.

480
00:40:51,412 --> 00:40:52,011
Sheng.

481
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:54,252
Sheng.

482
00:40:55,892 --> 00:40:57,152
I knew it was you.

483
00:40:57,152 --> 00:40:57,972
Dad.

484
00:40:57,972 --> 00:40:59,732
You didn't hear me?

485
00:41:01,812 --> 00:41:02,992
No.

486
00:41:02,992 --> 00:41:04,291
Geez.

487
00:41:04,291 --> 00:41:06,171
Want some pork mooncakes?

488
00:41:07,651 --> 00:41:10,672
Your mom got some this afternoon.
Hop on. Let's go home.

489
00:41:10,672 --> 00:41:11,611
No.

490
00:41:14,051 --> 00:41:18,272
My classmates are coming.
I'm lining up for them.

491
00:41:18,272 --> 00:41:22,912
I was bragging to them
about the pork mooncakes here.

492
00:41:22,912 --> 00:41:24,812
Go home. I'll be home soon.

493
00:41:24,812 --> 00:41:28,292
Your mom got a whole pack of those.
It's too many for us.

494
00:41:28,292 --> 00:41:31,452
Tell your friends to pass by
our house and pick up some. Hop on.

495
00:41:31,452 --> 00:41:32,812
No. Dad.

496
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:35,852
It has to be hot.

497
00:41:38,171 --> 00:41:40,811
There's something wrong with you.

498
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:47,411
You never line up here even if
we tell you to. What's going on today?

499
00:41:47,411 --> 00:41:48,651
There is no such thing.

500
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:54,852
The line is moving.

501
00:42:02,252 --> 00:42:03,011
Go ahead.

502
00:42:07,571 --> 00:42:11,651
Dad, go home. I'll be home soon.

503
00:42:11,651 --> 00:42:14,831
But I'm coming out for groceries.

504
00:42:14,831 --> 00:42:16,212
Well, go get the groceries.

505
00:42:16,212 --> 00:42:17,432
See you later.

506
00:42:17,432 --> 00:42:18,971
Bye.

507
00:42:18,971 --> 00:42:19,932
See you.

508
00:42:24,131 --> 00:42:27,412
You scared me to death, you know?
Why did you pat me?

509
00:42:27,412 --> 00:42:30,332
I thought my dad recognized you or...

510
00:42:45,451 --> 00:42:49,531
Dad, didn't you go shopping?
Why are you back?
