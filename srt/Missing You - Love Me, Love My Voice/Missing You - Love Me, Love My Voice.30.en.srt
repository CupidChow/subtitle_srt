(Would you like some soda?)

26
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:50,227
Mo Qingcheng is all over his wife
and ignores her classmate.

27
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:02,106
- Is it a bad time?
- You are late to catch on.

28
00:02:02,826 --> 00:02:07,186
- Shall we leave?
- And make her throw away the smoothies?

29
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:16,546
Let me help her.

30
00:02:19,546 --> 00:02:20,826
What should we do?

31
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:22,826
I...

32
00:02:28,266 --> 00:02:30,467
- Should we give them a push?
- How?

33
00:02:31,307 --> 00:02:33,787
Set up an image for Zhou.

34
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:36,067
Watch this.

35
00:02:44,986 --> 00:02:47,747
- That's my seat.
- Let me take a few bites.

36
00:02:47,947 --> 00:02:50,187
Aren't you very generous?

37
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:52,027
Yeah. Go ahead.

38
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:54,187
Both mango-flavored.

39
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,947
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

40
00:03:08,266 --> 00:03:09,666
It's freezing. Slow down.

41
00:03:10,826 --> 00:03:13,266
See? And he's considerate.

42
00:03:15,627 --> 00:03:19,546
Zhou, I heard that you had a hard time
starting the business.

43
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:23,056
- Why?
- Just chitchatting.

44
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:26,426
We're trying to learn
from your glorious past.

45
00:03:26,787 --> 00:03:31,546
- Starting a business is always hard.
- Tell us more about it.

46
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:44,106
We had to get business
and go to the hospitals all day.

47
00:03:44,227 --> 00:03:47,467
Yeah, it was very tiring
at the beginning.

48
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:52,747
He couldn't eat and could barely
sleep for a few hours every day, right?

49
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:58,266
In the end, his girlfriend broke up
with him, and he remained single.

50
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:01,627
He is such a nice guy.

51
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:05,347
How come he's still single, right?

52
00:04:15,027 --> 00:04:19,667
Mo Bai, if you have nothing to do,
eat some more, okay?

53
00:04:20,146 --> 00:04:21,867
Keep your mouth shut.

54
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:25,026
Why are you getting shy?
Fine, I'll be quiet.

55
00:04:26,226 --> 00:04:30,706
- Didn't you want to see the lighthouse?
- What about my smoothie?

56
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:32,307
- Take it with you.
- You...

57
00:04:33,867 --> 00:04:36,867
He's got a temper.
I'll leave you to talk.

58
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:41,586
- I'm still building up the vibe.
- That's enough.

59
00:04:45,107 --> 00:04:46,826
Don't listen to them.

60
00:05:16,307 --> 00:05:17,706
Have it. Don't catch a cold.

61
00:05:18,786 --> 00:05:21,867
- Aren't you cold?
- No, I'm well-built.

62
00:05:24,266 --> 00:05:26,146
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

63
00:05:41,826 --> 00:05:43,547
It's already 2:00. Let me walk you back.

64
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:49,826
Okay.

65
00:05:51,826 --> 00:05:53,586
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

66
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:58,786
I'll walk you back and then walk around.

67
00:05:59,867 --> 00:06:00,947
Aren't you sleepy?

68
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:05,067
I forgot to tell you.

69
00:06:06,107 --> 00:06:07,307
Mr. Mo

70
00:06:08,346 --> 00:06:11,280
sent me a message that
Sheng fell asleep in my room

71
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,547
and told me to sleep out.

72
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:17,466
I guess I'd rather take a walk out here

73
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:20,266
than sleep on the rattan chair.

74
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,146
You can't walk all night.

75
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,226
Then...

76
00:06:32,867 --> 00:06:35,107
- How about...
- No.

77
00:06:35,747 --> 00:06:38,706
I'm not trying to sleep in your room.

78
00:06:39,507 --> 00:06:40,947
Don't get me wrong.

79
00:06:43,667 --> 00:06:45,947
I'm not sleepy yet. I can walk with you.

80
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:53,264
It's a long shore.

81
00:06:53,648 --> 00:06:56,906
Maybe we can walk until dawn
and see the sunrise.

82
00:07:00,026 --> 00:07:03,346
You're getting slower. Are you tired?

83
00:07:05,747 --> 00:07:08,906
Maybe it's because of the ascending.
I am a bit tired.

84
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:11,667
Let's sit here for a break.

85
00:07:12,706 --> 00:07:13,346
Okay.

86
00:07:22,867 --> 00:07:24,947
Actually, I enjoy talking to you.

87
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,987
Me too.

88
00:07:35,466 --> 00:07:37,386
So let's talk more.

89
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:41,226
Sure. About what?

90
00:07:43,226 --> 00:07:44,867
About how you started the business.

91
00:07:46,146 --> 00:07:48,747
How I started the business.

92
00:07:51,386 --> 00:07:54,146
Well, when I was a kid,

93
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:57,466
I was a troublemaker
and never studied, you know?

94
00:07:57,667 --> 00:08:03,667
Then I met Mo Qingcheng
and Feng Yasong after I graduated.

95
00:08:03,667 --> 00:08:07,386
I thought I shouldn't be left behind.

96
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:10,747
So I worked hard to start the business.

97
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:15,067
Come to think of it,
it's important to have good friends.

98
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:19,466
A good influence keeps you motivated.

99
00:08:20,026 --> 00:08:23,187
- Yeah, that's me and Sheng.
- Right?

100
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:30,466
Thanks to my buddies, I started
my business relatively smoothly.

101
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,267
I guess I made it.

102
00:08:51,106 --> 00:08:55,626
So how did you
break up with your girlfriend?

103
00:09:04,826 --> 00:09:09,866
It was tiring to start the business
and I didn't have time for her.

104
00:09:10,427 --> 00:09:13,706
We slowly lost passion and broke up.

105
00:09:14,947 --> 00:09:15,787
Peacefully.

106
00:09:19,826 --> 00:09:20,826
Who brought it up?

107
00:09:22,947 --> 00:09:23,586
She did.

108
00:09:27,106 --> 00:09:29,667
Didn't you try to get her back?

109
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:35,307
No, I think love has to be mutual.

110
00:09:36,547 --> 00:09:39,280
It takes two people
to have a relationship, after all.

111
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:45,027
One-sided love doesn't lead anywhere.

112
00:09:47,466 --> 00:09:51,626
I agree that love should be mutual.

113
00:09:55,787 --> 00:09:57,226
Everybody needs feedback.

114
00:10:17,586 --> 00:10:19,067
Well, that's it.

115
00:10:19,826 --> 00:10:22,387
Let's keep walking.
It's getting cold sitting here, right?

116
00:10:23,307 --> 00:10:24,307
- Let's go then.
- Alright.

117
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:25,787
Let's go.

118
00:10:28,706 --> 00:10:32,706
Let's talk about you. Any plans?

119
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:38,387
I want to get my postgraduate degree
and find a job I like.

120
00:10:39,307 --> 00:10:42,947
Hopefully, I can find someone I like
who also likes me.

121
00:11:31,947 --> 00:11:33,907
I actually slept here the whole night.

122
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:41,106
Where is Xiaoxing?

123
00:11:57,826 --> 00:11:59,667
I deserve a massage, okay?

124
00:12:01,506 --> 00:12:01,986
Morning.

125
00:12:03,746 --> 00:12:05,947
I'll go upstairs to wash up.

126
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,267
You're finally back.

127
00:12:23,746 --> 00:12:25,307
Juemei slept here last night?

128
00:12:26,672 --> 00:12:27,760
Of course not.

129
00:12:28,624 --> 00:12:32,746
You ditched me for your boyfriend.
I stayed up all night. I'm so sleepy.

130
00:12:33,027 --> 00:12:34,586
You stayed up all night?

131
00:12:35,947 --> 00:12:37,547
Not only that,

132
00:12:38,787 --> 00:12:40,307
we went

133
00:12:42,106 --> 00:12:45,626
for a walk until dawn.

134
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,547
I was about to head back,

135
00:12:48,706 --> 00:12:52,027
but Mr. Mo texted Juemei that

136
00:12:52,147 --> 00:12:55,626
his wife had fallen asleep
and that he should sleep out.

137
00:12:55,746 --> 00:13:00,866
Where could he go?
So I walked with him all night.

138
00:13:00,986 --> 00:13:07,667
I can't invite him over for the night.
I have to be discreet.

139
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:15,187
My legs are sore. Massage them.

140
00:13:17,027 --> 00:13:21,187
So Juemei was very decent
and didn't ask to share your bed.

141
00:13:23,147 --> 00:13:26,267
H-He is very decent.

142
00:13:28,787 --> 00:13:30,067
It's only 6:00. Let me sleep more.

143
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:38,307
Tell me what you did.

144
00:13:40,187 --> 00:13:42,907
Nothing. I was sleepy.

145
00:13:43,027 --> 00:13:46,147
You took a nap in the afternoon
but I only slept for ten minutes.

146
00:13:47,826 --> 00:13:49,168
So I fell asleep.

147
00:13:50,226 --> 00:13:50,947
That's it?

148
00:13:53,947 --> 00:13:56,307
Gu Sheng, you're so insensitive.

149
00:13:58,106 --> 00:13:58,787
Sleep.

150
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:09,547
You should massage my legs, okay?
I walked the whole night.

151
00:14:11,106 --> 00:14:12,387
Don't you want to say something?

152
00:14:15,106 --> 00:14:18,226
Stop smiling. What a surprise.

153
00:14:19,267 --> 00:14:21,147
You favor your girlfriend
over your buddies.

154
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:28,866
Think about it from another aspect.
I was creating opportunities for you.

155
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:32,706
Creating opportunities? What for?

156
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:45,226
- You think too much, okay?
- Yeah?

157
00:14:50,547 --> 00:14:55,466
But even if I'm interested,
I can't just sleep over at her place.

158
00:14:58,027 --> 00:15:01,106
Don't you know that we're just friends?

159
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:03,226
I knew it.

160
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:05,826
You're a decent guy.

161
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:12,746
But you talked the whole night. You must
have learned more about each other.

162
00:15:22,147 --> 00:15:27,547
Mo Qingcheng, you're playing
tricks on me, huh? Just wait.

163
00:15:29,706 --> 00:15:30,147
Just wait.

164
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:34,427
You have to be grateful.

165
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,626
(Intercontinental
One Thousand Island Lake Resort)

166
00:15:43,626 --> 00:15:44,267
Sir, this way.

167
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:46,226
- Come on, sir, this way.
- Enough.

168
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:47,792
- Come on.
- Feishao.

169
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:50,307
Food is ready. Grab a seat.

170
00:15:52,027 --> 00:15:53,866
- Grab a seat.
- So many dishes.

171
00:15:54,826 --> 00:15:56,307
Send a photo to Zhu.

172
00:15:57,746 --> 00:16:00,027
- Sit in front of me.
- Thanks.

173
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,187
- Sit here.
- I'll be next to Doudou.

174
00:16:03,147 --> 00:16:03,746
Xiaoxing.

175
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:06,787
- Where do I sit?
- Sit anywhere you want.

176
00:16:06,787 --> 00:16:07,787
- Really?
- Sit here.

177
00:16:07,787 --> 00:16:10,547
- Come here.
- Zheng, I want to sit next to you.

178
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:14,626
Guys, they make great fish here.

179
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:17,466
It's still midday. Let's dig in.

180
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:20,586
- Then let's drive the off-roader, okay?
- Alright.

181
00:16:20,667 --> 00:16:21,947
- Here.
- This is tender.

182
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:24,027
- What's this?
- Tofu.

183
00:16:24,106 --> 00:16:26,746
- Where is the fish?
- Have some fish.

184
00:16:28,226 --> 00:16:29,866
- It's good.
- Is it?

185
00:16:31,027 --> 00:16:31,986
Thank you.

186
00:16:32,826 --> 00:16:34,746
- It's so nice.
- Dig in.

187
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:43,027
Doudou, can you
put an extra bed in your room?

188
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,226
- Yeah, why?
- Thanks.

189
00:16:46,826 --> 00:16:50,187
Let Xiaoxing share your room.
It's livelier like this.

190
00:16:51,387 --> 00:16:52,746
What about Sheng?

191
00:16:55,187 --> 00:16:58,907
She's scared of the dark.
How is she going to sleep alone?

192
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:03,307
Yeah, they are fine together.

193
00:17:03,387 --> 00:17:05,306
Why would she squeeze at my place?

194
00:17:09,026 --> 00:17:13,147
Doudou, here. Have some fish heads.
It's good for the brain.

195
00:17:13,147 --> 00:17:18,026
Are you so close to Xiaoxing now?
You're arranging for her accommodation?

196
00:17:25,266 --> 00:17:28,066
- Cousin, want some fish soup?
- Yeah, thanks.

197
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:28,907
You're welcome.

198
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:42,827
- Isn't he taking good care of her?
- H-He's fine. There's a long way to go.

199
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:45,546
Have a shrimp.

200
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,026
What's going on?

201
00:17:49,427 --> 00:17:51,947
- Are you eating it or not?
- Yeah.

202
00:17:52,107 --> 00:17:54,627
You got it for me.
Of course, I'd eat it.

203
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,706
It's nice. Try it.

204
00:18:03,147 --> 00:18:03,986
Have some meat.

205
00:18:10,147 --> 00:18:12,587
- Slowly. Be careful of the bones.
- Let me teach you.

206
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:14,587
Teach me.

207
00:18:16,066 --> 00:18:17,627
Why's the watermelon so sweet?

208
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:23,986
- Mr. Mu, have a pineapple. Be sour.
- Let me peel a shrimp for you.

209
00:18:24,506 --> 00:18:28,147
Come on, you didn't remove the shell
or clean the sand vein.

210
00:18:28,627 --> 00:18:31,506
Loners help loners. Sure.
Peel one for me. I'll eat it.

211
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,147
- Alright, wait.
- Seriously.

212
00:18:36,226 --> 00:18:38,786
- I'm a VIP. I know everything.
- Alright.

213
00:18:39,026 --> 00:18:40,947
- Take this one.
- I'll ask you for help.

214
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:49,147
Guys, this is off-roader driving,
the most special event here.

215
00:18:49,147 --> 00:18:52,427
- Nice cars.
- Why is it the most special?

216
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:57,627
The route is complicated.
It's very thrilling. Take a look.

217
00:18:57,746 --> 00:19:02,827
The mountain road
is narrow, bumpy, and lengthy.

218
00:19:02,986 --> 00:19:06,827
- It's one of a kind.
- Not bad.

219
00:19:06,947 --> 00:19:08,827
You make it sound like
we're here to suffer.

220
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:11,026
Aren't we here to enjoy the excitement?

221
00:19:11,147 --> 00:19:15,568
Let's form groups of two.
Couples should share a car.

222
00:19:15,706 --> 00:19:18,387
It's a perfect chance
to get closer to each other.

223
00:19:19,546 --> 00:19:24,147
There's only one couple.
The others can team up as they want.

224
00:19:27,427 --> 00:19:30,306
- Only one couple.
- Enough.

225
00:19:32,947 --> 00:19:36,587
I prepared handkerchiefs for you.
It's going to be very dusty.

226
00:19:36,706 --> 00:19:39,627
And it's a long way. Cover your face.

227
00:19:39,867 --> 00:19:44,226
- Lady first. One for each. Xiaoxing.
- You're very considerate today.

228
00:19:44,306 --> 00:19:46,306
- He became so thoughtful.
- Caring.

229
00:19:46,947 --> 00:19:48,187
- The nice guy.
- I want this one.

230
00:19:48,306 --> 00:19:49,706
- Come on, Sheng.
- This one.

231
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:52,627
- Come on, pick one.
- Guys, pick yours.

232
00:19:53,147 --> 00:19:54,706
I'll show you how to wear it.

233
00:19:55,147 --> 00:19:57,506
Mine is too colorful. Let's exchange.

234
00:19:57,506 --> 00:20:00,427
- You know how to do it? Amazing.
- Let me help.

235
00:20:01,587 --> 00:20:03,546
- Here.
- Help Xiaoxing.

236
00:20:06,187 --> 00:20:08,506
- Give it to me, honey.
- Thanks, Doudou.

237
00:20:09,546 --> 00:20:14,066
It's going to be dusty on the road.
Just leave your eyes out.

238
00:20:16,746 --> 00:20:18,387
- Is it too tight?
- It's alright.

239
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:22,266
- Loners help loners.
- Sure.

240
00:20:22,466 --> 00:20:23,746
- Help me.
- Let me.

241
00:20:23,867 --> 00:20:25,986
- Come on.
- Come on, Feishao. Let me help.

242
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:26,427
Come on.

243
00:20:28,546 --> 00:20:29,347
Tell me if it's tight.

244
00:20:31,387 --> 00:20:31,907
Is it tight?

245
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:35,746
- Alright.
- Alright.

246
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:39,827
- Get in the car.
- Thanks, Doudou.

247
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:41,947
Pick a car.

248
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:44,187
- That one.
- Okay.

249
00:20:44,627 --> 00:20:45,427
Let's go.

250
00:20:46,706 --> 00:20:49,466
- What are you doing?
- So rare. You're not following her.

251
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:53,066
- Do you have to be so sarcastic?
- It depends on my mood.

252
00:20:54,667 --> 00:20:56,786
I feel sorry for you.
Let's share the ride.

253
00:20:56,907 --> 00:21:00,466
- Don't.
- You're the only outsider here.

254
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,506
- I'll register an account tomorrow.
- Then I'll be your senior.

255
00:21:03,706 --> 00:21:06,066
- Whatever.
- Pick a car.

256
00:21:07,107 --> 00:21:09,587
- Well...
- Someone's calling you. Go.

257
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:14,347
- Be careful.
- Okay.

258
00:21:16,947 --> 00:21:21,147
- So, let's share one.
- Alright, agreed.

259
00:21:21,266 --> 00:21:23,387
- We all go in couples.
- I agree too.

260
00:21:23,387 --> 00:21:26,587
- Just share a car.
- Mind your own business.

261
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:31,587
Mu, that one matches
our clothes. Let's go get it.

262
00:21:33,347 --> 00:21:34,187
We...

263
00:21:34,306 --> 00:21:37,147
- Doudou, what's going on?
- See? Keep your mouth shut.

264
00:21:37,347 --> 00:21:38,706
- Fasten the seat belt.
- And this one.

265
00:21:38,706 --> 00:21:40,466
You too.

266
00:21:40,587 --> 00:21:41,907
Don't play dirty.

267
00:21:42,546 --> 00:21:43,706
- Let me.
- First come, first served.

268
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:46,667
- I got it first.
- Don't play dirty.

269
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,947
- Wait for the next time.
- Seriously.

270
00:22:00,587 --> 00:22:01,706
Wait, slow down.

271
00:22:03,627 --> 00:22:04,587
Safety first.

272
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,306
Fasten it.

273
00:22:12,306 --> 00:22:14,026
- Thanks.
- Thank you, Mr. Mo.

274
00:22:14,226 --> 00:22:15,187
See you.

275
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:18,706
- Won't you check on me?
- So considerate.

276
00:22:18,986 --> 00:22:22,907
He's not only nice to Sheng.
He's nice to everyone. Perfect.

277
00:22:23,026 --> 00:22:25,506
Let's observe more.

278
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:31,066
Mr. Mo, done with fan service?

279
00:22:32,506 --> 00:22:33,506
Is he just a fan?

280
00:22:35,107 --> 00:22:37,466
Kill two birds with one rock.
Impressive, Mr. Mo.

281
00:22:42,546 --> 00:22:46,867
I come here every month.
So follow me and stay safe, okay?

282
00:22:46,986 --> 00:22:49,786
- Okay.
- Slowly. Be careful.

283
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:26,706
You got this?

284
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:32,107
- Mu, can't you go faster?
- Safety comes first.

285
00:24:08,746 --> 00:24:10,107
Catch up with them.

286
00:24:29,947 --> 00:24:33,226
- Here we go.
- Is it ready?

287
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:35,867
- This one is ready.
- Okay.

288
00:24:35,947 --> 00:24:37,226
- Here.
- Okay.

289
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:38,786
- Bring me a plate. It's ready.
- Here.

290
00:24:43,107 --> 00:24:45,666
- Have a skewer.
- Thanks, Doudou.

291
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:46,746
- No problem.
- What's this?

292
00:24:48,107 --> 00:24:50,187
- Mr. Mo grilled it. Have it.
- Thanks.

293
00:24:50,306 --> 00:24:51,627
- Stop taking photos.
- Pork belly.

294
00:24:51,746 --> 00:24:52,986
- Here.
- It's amazing. Try it.

295
00:24:54,187 --> 00:24:55,667
- Pork belly.
- Here.

296
00:24:56,466 --> 00:24:57,347
- Try it.
- So many.

297
00:24:57,347 --> 00:24:58,867
- Smells nice.
- Add some pepper.

298
00:25:01,147 --> 00:25:01,867
It's burning.

299
00:25:02,066 --> 00:25:04,187
- It's ready.
- Okay, thanks.

300
00:25:05,947 --> 00:25:10,827
Barbecue by the lake. Food and view.
But something is missing.

301
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:12,107
What can it be?

302
00:25:12,226 --> 00:25:17,506
Nice view. Nice cuisine.
Shouldn't we ask Mr. Mo to sing for us?

303
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:18,786
- Yeah.
- Right?

304
00:25:19,026 --> 00:25:20,427
Yeah.

305
00:25:20,706 --> 00:25:21,306
Alright.

306
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:25,986
- Really?
- You're not interested?

307
00:25:25,986 --> 00:25:29,107
I'm just surprised. What would you sing?

308
00:25:31,266 --> 00:25:31,827
Dawn and Dusk.

309
00:25:32,986 --> 00:25:37,746
Dawn and Dusk.
Isn't that someone's love song?

310
00:25:38,627 --> 00:25:43,427
- It's lonely to sing it alone.
- It has to be sung by a couple.

311
00:25:44,786 --> 00:25:48,066
- Shall we?
- Of course, I'll join you.

312
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:49,746
Then I'll be the accompaniment.

313
00:25:51,107 --> 00:25:54,187
- Sheng, which key do you want?
- A-flat.

314
00:25:54,306 --> 00:25:56,506
A-flat.

315
00:25:56,627 --> 00:25:57,907
- Let me.
- You're next.

316
00:25:57,907 --> 00:25:59,986
- You got this?
- Mind your own business.

317
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:02,546
- You'll see. Let's go.

00:28:08,803 --> 00:28:11,643
What a perfect match.
That's my brother-in-law.

358
00:28:14,643 --> 00:28:15,922
Did you say "brother-in-law"?

359
00:28:16,563 --> 00:28:21,482
N-No way. You heard me wrong.

360
00:28:21,682 --> 00:28:24,522
- Doudou, he said "brother-in-law".
- I think I heard it.

361
00:28:24,522 --> 00:28:28,043
Doudou, you heard me wrong.
Why are you siding with her?

362
00:28:28,202 --> 00:28:29,643
- You finally admitted it.
- I...

Stop spying on them.

440

You can entrust your cousin to him.

- Thanks, Doudou.

445
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,964
You've changed. You used to
feed me first. Now it's different.

446
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:31,620
- Don't be petty. She's a little girl.
- Here you are.

447
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:36,380
- No, he's kidding. Have it.
- Okay.

448
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:37,659
So petty.

449
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:44,179
- I want that one.
- Get it yourself.

450
00:33:46,179 --> 00:33:47,060
Fine, here you are.

451
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:53,340
- Her skewers taste better.
- Of course, we're still a CP.

452
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:57,100
Feng Yasong,
if Doudou ever dates someone,

453
00:33:57,219 --> 00:34:00,419
- will you fight him or not?
- Of course, I will.

454
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:04,140
I'll beat him up and argue with him.
Violence is the first solution.

455
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:09,699
- Who dares to snatch my CP?
- "Who dares to snatch my CP?"

456
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:13,179
Don't mind him. My buddy
is a nice guy but he likes to bluff.

457
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:14,379
No.

458
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:18,379
- A giant of words.
- Come on.

459
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,900
- Dig in.
- Let's shoot some arrows tomorrow.

460
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,940
- Here.
- Shoulder-width apart.

461
00:34:26,060 --> 00:34:28,940
Hold it like this. Or this.

462
00:34:29,968 --> 00:34:33,884
Okay, let me show you
the God of Archery.

463
00:34:39,324 --> 00:34:40,364
Amazing.

464
00:34:40,963 --> 00:34:42,253
I'll do it again.

465
00:34:42,253 --> 00:34:42,963
Go ahead.

466
00:34:43,856 --> 00:34:44,624
Watch me.

467
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,764
- Seventh ring. You got it.
- Not so great.

468
00:34:52,764 --> 00:34:53,808
You're awesome.

469
00:34:58,448 --> 00:35:01,776
I'm trying hard. It's my first attempt.

470
00:35:02,032 --> 00:35:03,844
I'm glad it worked. Stop laughing.

471
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:06,960
- It's always tough at the beginning. Try again.
- Okay.

472
00:35:08,003 --> 00:35:09,443
Relax your shoulders.

473
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:11,884
It's a tutorial.

474
00:35:11,884 --> 00:35:14,896
- I can't hold it any longer.
- Let go.

475
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,403
Alright, one more.

476
00:35:21,403 --> 00:35:21,964
Let's go.

477
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:25,595
I'm tired.
I can't pull the string anymore.

478
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:38,075
Align your eye, arrow tip,
and bull's eye.

479
00:35:39,756 --> 00:35:42,356
Let go fast. One, two, three.

480
00:35:46,956 --> 00:35:50,476
- You're amazing.
- You're amazing. Fast learner.

481
00:35:51,916 --> 00:35:53,476
- One more.
- Okay.

482
00:35:55,120 --> 00:36:00,912
Put the hand here. Otherwise, you don't
have the power to pull the string.

483
00:36:00,912 --> 00:36:04,075
Hold it here.
Yeah, put it under your jaw.

484
00:36:04,675 --> 00:36:08,316
He's trying but he dares not.
We have to help him.

485
00:36:09,115 --> 00:36:14,195
Yeah, push. Relax your shoulders.

486
00:36:16,715 --> 00:36:17,876
Good. Hit the target.

487
00:36:18,836 --> 00:36:20,624
- You're progressing. One more.
- Juemei.

488
00:36:21,648 --> 00:36:25,316
- I challenge you to a contest.
- What kind of contest?

489
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:29,595
Three shots. Whoever scores higher wins.

490
00:36:29,916 --> 00:36:32,836
We can go for 30 shots.
I don't have a problem.

491
00:36:34,996 --> 00:36:39,075
You're so bold. I've won
the first prize in college, okay?

492
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:40,115
Ask Feishao.

493
00:36:41,035 --> 00:36:42,704
You think you can terrify me?

494
00:36:45,436 --> 00:36:46,235
Change the sheets.

495
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:54,635
Let me clarify the rules.
Three shots. Whoever scores higher wins.

496
00:36:55,472 --> 00:36:58,476
Track No.1. Track No.2.
Start with Track No.1.

497
00:37:00,515 --> 00:37:01,035
Go for it.

498
00:37:01,316 --> 00:37:03,996
Let him win, okay? Don't steal his show.

499
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:06,115
No way. I have to teach him a lesson.

500
00:37:08,595 --> 00:37:09,796
I'll let him win
by one point for each shot.

501
00:37:17,756 --> 00:37:20,876
- Eighth ring.
- Zhou Zheng, eighth ring.

502
00:37:23,472 --> 00:37:25,876
- Let's compete with them in secret.
- Alright, good luck.

503
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:29,115
- Mo Bai, take photos for me.
- Coming.

504
00:37:29,436 --> 00:37:31,635
Let's see what
the pro player is capable of.

505
00:37:34,276 --> 00:37:40,756
Don't let me down, Juemei Shayi.
You'd better start dating her.

506
00:37:43,796 --> 00:37:45,756
Wang Ke, seventh ring.

507
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:48,356
Juemei is one point ahead.

508
00:37:51,316 --> 00:37:51,836
Fifth ring.

509
00:37:53,635 --> 00:37:54,796
Let me hit the bull's eye.

510
00:37:59,075 --> 00:38:01,996
- Make some noise.
- Alright!

511
00:38:06,916 --> 00:38:08,916
Zhou Zheng, fifth ring.

512
00:38:10,396 --> 00:38:13,796
- It was windy.
- I can't lose too obviously.

513
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:15,235
Aim for the fifth ring.

514
00:38:16,316 --> 00:38:18,064
- Fifth ring.
- Fine.

515
00:38:19,555 --> 00:38:23,635
- Juemei, is that all you've got?
- Cut the crap. Hurry up.

516
00:38:23,876 --> 00:38:26,595
Wang Ke, it's time
for you to turn the game around.

517
00:38:28,635 --> 00:38:30,256
Will you make it?

518
00:38:34,276 --> 00:38:38,128
Wang Ke, sixth ring. It's a draw.

519
00:38:38,635 --> 00:38:42,515
- I told you the fifth ring.
- It flew up a bit, okay?

520
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:47,836
Seventh ring.

521
00:38:58,956 --> 00:39:02,356
- Eighth ring.
- Zhou Zheng, eighth ring.

522
00:39:03,035 --> 00:39:04,436
Impressive, Mr. Zhou.

523
00:39:04,436 --> 00:39:09,195
This is the final shot.
Wang Ke is under huge pressure.

524
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:11,276
Stop it. I'm so nervous.

525
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:18,316
Let's see how he does in the final shot.

526
00:39:24,396 --> 00:39:27,916
Wang Ke, seventh ring.
I hereby announce the result.

527
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:31,876
The winner is Zhou Zheng with 21 points.

528
00:39:35,316 --> 00:39:37,796
- Zheng, you're amazing.
- Careful.

529
00:39:37,796 --> 00:39:43,155
Way to go, Juemei. You defeated
a semi-professional so easily.

530
00:39:43,155 --> 00:39:46,515
- Semi-professional? You're an amateur.
- Too easy.

531
00:39:46,555 --> 00:39:48,595
You were even stepping on the line.

532
00:39:49,316 --> 00:39:53,316
- You're right, Mr. Zhou.
- Three, two, one. Let go.

533
00:39:59,195 --> 00:39:59,876
Tenth ring.

534
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:03,956
- Amazing.
- Practice with me.

535
00:40:04,515 --> 00:40:06,155
- Let me try it.
- Alright.

536
00:40:06,155 --> 00:40:07,555
- Try it.
- Tenth ring.

537
00:40:07,555 --> 00:40:09,276
- Who did it?
- Really?

538
00:40:09,276 --> 00:40:11,876
Sheng? Sheng, was that you?

539
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,155
Five, seven, ten.

540
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:19,075
- She got 22 points in three shots.
- That's good.

541
00:40:20,476 --> 00:40:24,555
- You're amazing, Sheng.
- Sheng, I'm so proud of you.

542
00:40:25,796 --> 00:40:27,155
You did well.

543
00:40:28,916 --> 00:40:30,635
You're the champion.

544
00:40:30,956 --> 00:40:38,996
- Champion!
- Champion!

545
00:40:39,515 --> 00:40:42,316
So talent matters a lot, right?

546
00:40:43,075 --> 00:40:45,155
Gifted. Look at them.

547
00:40:45,675 --> 00:40:46,195
Champion!

548
00:41:00,595 --> 00:41:02,675
Are we having dinner together?
What would you like?

549
00:41:05,075 --> 00:41:09,515
I'm not sure. Let's see what there is.

550
00:41:09,916 --> 00:41:10,675
You have a date?

551
00:41:12,075 --> 00:41:18,876
No, Juemei doesn't have an appetite.
So we're getting some special cuisine.

552
00:41:20,316 --> 00:41:22,096
Special cuisine.

553
00:41:24,075 --> 00:41:26,876
- Not so special.
- Alright, you're free tonight.

554
00:41:26,996 --> 00:41:28,496
Don't come back. Bye.

555
00:41:46,396 --> 00:41:52,555
(Someone had fun shooting arrows
with his wife, ignoring everyone else.)

556
00:41:52,555 --> 00:41:58,306
(Mo Bai, please update more about "someone".
Mr. Qiang is so talented!)

557
00:42:09,876 --> 00:42:10,916
Want to take a nap?

558
00:42:12,876 --> 00:42:14,756
