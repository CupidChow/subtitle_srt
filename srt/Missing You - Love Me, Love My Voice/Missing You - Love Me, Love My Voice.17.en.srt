(You're the best. I'm the best)

26
00:01:51,248 --> 00:01:53,588
There are people fishing over there.
Let's take a look.

27
00:01:53,588 --> 00:01:54,127
Okay.

28
00:02:00,127 --> 00:02:00,607
Let's go.

29
00:02:18,167 --> 00:02:19,007
Hello, Sir.

30
00:02:20,447 --> 00:02:23,127
May I ask if your fishing rods
are available for rent?

31
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:25,488
You're Yuerong Manor's guests, right?

32
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:31,768
Feel free to catch some fish.
No need for any rent, come on.

33
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:34,287
Be careful.

34
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:35,088
Thank you.

35
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,508
I made it by myself.
It's not so professional.

36
00:02:37,508 --> 00:02:41,368
We're not any fishing experts.
We don't need something sophisticated.

37
00:02:42,407 --> 00:02:44,028
Okay, we won't bother you.
We'll be over there.

38
00:02:44,028 --> 00:02:44,888
Okay.

39
00:02:44,888 --> 00:02:45,447
Thank you.

40
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:46,567
Thanks. Let's go.

41
00:02:51,208 --> 00:02:52,287
- How about here?
- Okay.

42
00:02:54,368 --> 00:02:56,567
Be careful. Right here.

43
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:57,088
Okay.

44
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:02,048
I don't know how to do it.

45
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:04,368
It wouldn't be fun if you knew how.

46
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:12,127
Thank you.

47
00:03:13,208 --> 00:03:15,928
You haven't thrown the hook yet.
Why are you sitting down?

48
00:03:18,608 --> 00:03:19,968
I said I don't know how.

49
00:03:19,968 --> 00:03:20,648
I'll help you.

50
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:31,248
Alright, throw it now.

51
00:03:42,928 --> 00:03:43,488
Do it again.

52
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:53,007
Come on.

53
00:04:01,088 --> 00:04:01,887
Is it okay like this?

54
00:04:17,168 --> 00:04:18,928
Do you think I can catch a fish?

55
00:04:20,368 --> 00:04:20,928
It depends.

56
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:31,168
I'm a traveler from afar. I've never
crossed paths with the fish here.

57
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:33,007
Hard to say.

58
00:05:08,647 --> 00:05:10,327

Son.

71
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:43,728
Caught any fish?

72
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:49,087
Not yet.

73
00:07:00,767 --> 00:07:02,368
- Hello?
- Mr. Mo.

74
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:04,047
It's really urgent.

75
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:05,068
Okay?

76
00:07:05,068 --> 00:07:08,327
Let Sheng do the vocal harmony.
We really can't find anyone else.

77
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:12,068
Okay, I get it. Let me ask her.

78
00:07:14,848 --> 00:07:15,447
Bye.

79
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,348
Is something wrong?

80
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:25,368
Feishao discussed
a new plan for the theme song.

81
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:29,528
They want you to help them
with the harmony.

82
00:07:29,528 --> 00:07:30,728
Me?

83
00:07:32,248 --> 00:07:33,147
I can't.

84
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:34,728
You haven't tried.

85
00:07:36,488 --> 00:07:42,327
I haven't performed live once.
Let alone a show this big.

86
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:44,568
There is always a first time.

87
00:07:44,568 --> 00:07:47,488
But it can't be your 10th Anniversary.

88
00:07:47,488 --> 00:07:51,047
What's wrong with it?

89
00:07:51,047 --> 00:07:56,272
Your dubbing team is famous.
Every actor has millions of fans.

90
00:07:56,272 --> 00:08:02,127
This Anniversary must be perfect.
We can't afford to make mistakes. And...

91
00:08:04,288 --> 00:08:05,007
And what?

92
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:10,567
I'm worried our relationship will
become the topic of their discussion.

93
00:08:12,887 --> 00:08:17,168
So? We truly are in a relationship.

94
00:08:19,048 --> 00:08:21,928
We can't stop people from
saying whatever they want.

95
00:08:24,728 --> 00:08:31,368
To put it nicely, you're being neutral.
But the fact is, you're indifferent.

96
00:08:33,688 --> 00:08:40,947
Wang Ke wanted you. He heard our choir,
and he knows you are new to this.

97
00:08:40,947 --> 00:08:46,248
So he asked me. Just the harmony.
They'll support you.

98
00:08:50,887 --> 00:08:57,987
This is Guilin, and they can't
call someone over from afar right now.

99
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:04,368
They've managed to find someone
around here. But you're the best choice.

100
00:09:07,007 --> 00:09:07,968
I also think you can do it.

101
00:09:09,488 --> 00:09:13,088
My first time was also an accident
while helping a friend.

102
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:16,208
You are helping them, too.

103
00:09:17,568 --> 00:09:21,927
Give it a try.
After all, it's a memory, right?

104
00:09:26,448 --> 00:09:27,527
You are very persuasive.

105
00:09:30,647 --> 00:09:32,968
I admit that.

106
00:09:38,407 --> 00:09:39,208
Son.

107
00:09:40,368 --> 00:09:42,127
I have some oil tea here.
Let's drink it together.

108
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:44,628
No, thank you.

109
00:09:44,628 --> 00:09:50,748
Come on, you're Yangshuo's guests.
I'll treat you to a cup of tea.

110
00:09:50,748 --> 00:09:51,927
Okay, thank you.

111
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:55,528
So, what should we do with this rod?

112
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,287
Here, give it to me.

113
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:01,887
Okay.

114
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:05,968
Thank you.

115
00:10:07,127 --> 00:10:11,467
I have had butter tea. Their names
sound similar, but they look different.

116
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,987
- Here in Guilin,
- Thank you.

117
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:20,428
it's available everywhere. It's fried
with ginger and garlic, then boiled.

118
00:10:20,428 --> 00:10:21,768
It's spicy?

119
00:10:21,768 --> 00:10:23,647
Don't drink it yet. There's more.

120
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:26,268
Here.

121
00:10:26,268 --> 00:10:27,288
Thank you.

122
00:10:27,288 --> 00:10:29,847
It's popcorn and crispy nuts.
You can eat it.

123
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:30,528
Thank you.

124
00:10:30,528 --> 00:10:31,208
Drink it now.

125
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:40,227
You may not be used to this at first.
It's humid and rainy here,

126
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:41,807
but the oil tea can clear damp.

127
00:10:45,088 --> 00:10:46,908
You have a bite!

128
00:10:46,908 --> 00:10:48,007
Quick, take it.

129
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:01,728
It's a big fish!

130
00:11:12,728 --> 00:11:14,248
Such a big fish!

131
00:11:15,807 --> 00:11:19,108
What a big fish! So, you can fish.

132
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:22,448
When I was a kid, I lacked patience,
so my dad had me fish.

133
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:23,248
Let me take a look.

134
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,728
Here's a gift.

135
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:31,408
Take this back to Yuerong Manor
and let the chef cook it for you.

136
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:34,047
I just wanted my girlfriend
to experience the joy of fishing.

137
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:36,368
Not just for the fish.

138
00:11:38,127 --> 00:11:40,407
Can I really take it?
This is what you guys caught.

139
00:11:40,407 --> 00:11:42,628
But the fishing rod and bait
are all yours.

140
00:11:42,628 --> 00:11:44,647
Well, thank you.

141
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:51,647
Take this. I made it myself.
It definitely has a better taste.

142
00:11:53,647 --> 00:11:54,767
You guys take it.

143
00:11:54,767 --> 00:11:55,268
Thank you.

144
00:11:55,268 --> 00:11:55,848
Thank you.

145
00:11:59,007 --> 00:12:00,748
Here, come and taste it.

146
00:12:00,748 --> 00:12:01,887
What is this?

147
00:12:02,968 --> 00:12:03,888
Oil tea.

148
00:12:03,888 --> 00:12:05,087
Oil tea?

149
00:12:05,087 --> 00:12:06,148
Where did it come from?

150
00:12:06,148 --> 00:12:07,188
It was a gift.

151
00:12:07,188 --> 00:12:08,128
Gift?

152
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,088
From whom?

153
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:12,748
It's a long story.

154
00:12:12,748 --> 00:12:13,287
Sit.

155
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,608
Just in time, you're back.
Here's the thing.

156
00:12:20,287 --> 00:12:23,696
We need a 24-hour live broadcast
of behind-the-scenes before performance.

157
00:12:23,696 --> 00:12:28,588
This is the cameraman, Mr. Luan.
Now we need a host.

158
00:12:28,588 --> 00:12:31,508
I can't do it. Can anyone cover for me?

159
00:12:31,508 --> 00:12:34,648
We're saving our voices for later.
We can't keep talking before the show.

160
00:12:34,648 --> 00:12:36,788
Neither can us. We have to warm up.

161
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:39,088
Yeah, Sheng can't do it, too.

162
00:12:43,032 --> 00:12:44,429
(Ten years of dreams and love)

163
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:49,448
How is hosting so hard?
Who can do it then? I can't do it.

164
00:12:58,488 --> 00:13:02,088
Then it must be me and Mu.
Because we're the most handsome.

165
00:13:02,088 --> 00:13:02,647
You are.

166
00:13:02,647 --> 00:13:03,948
Did I say yes?

167
00:13:03,948 --> 00:13:08,888
We're partners. Without you,
it's too troublesome to explain.

168
00:13:08,888 --> 00:13:13,868
Besides, it's a 24-hour live stream.
I can't do it all by myself.

169
00:13:13,868 --> 00:13:17,827
Okay, then I'll play Shen Ce this time.
You play the villain.

170
00:13:17,827 --> 00:13:20,168
Didn't we agree
that you would play the villain?

171
00:13:20,168 --> 00:13:21,407
Can I drink this directly?

172
00:13:21,407 --> 00:13:27,488
Pour this in too. It's edible.
He said the tea can clear damp.

173
00:13:27,488 --> 00:13:29,868
Any disposable cups? If not,
I'll go back to the hotel and get some.

174
00:13:29,868 --> 00:13:33,127
Yes. I'll get it for you.
They are the hosts. Film them.

175
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:35,968
Well, I'm the villain.

176
00:13:40,728 --> 00:13:43,048
Three, two, one, begin.

177
00:13:43,048 --> 00:13:46,928
Hello everyone, long time no see.
I am Mo Bai, and here's Mu.

178
00:13:46,928 --> 00:13:48,028
Hello everyone.

179
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:55,867
It's 6:00 PM in Yangshuo, the sky
is still bright. In 24 hours,

180
00:13:55,867 --> 00:14:01,848
the 10th Anniversary will begin.
We'll have a dubbing show outdoors.

181
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:03,628
Say something they don't know.

182
00:14:03,628 --> 00:14:04,448
Oh.

183
00:14:05,688 --> 00:14:07,048
Can this part be deleted?

184
00:14:07,048 --> 00:14:12,008
It's live. But no worries,
it's just a behind-the-scenes for fun.

185
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:14,088
I don't want to be a sketch.

186
00:14:14,088 --> 00:14:16,007
It's okay. Everyone is used to it.

187
00:14:17,328 --> 00:14:17,927
Your turn.

188
00:14:21,088 --> 00:14:23,608
23 hours and 58 minutes left.

189
00:14:30,167 --> 00:14:35,368
Okay, I know Mu is very boring.
You guys just prefer me, right?

190
00:14:35,368 --> 00:14:37,328
So, in the next 24 hours...

191
00:14:37,328 --> 00:14:40,268
It's only 23 hours and 57 minutes left.

192
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:42,527
Could you please stop the countdown?

193
00:14:47,407 --> 00:14:51,248
Mr. Luan,
come and film our stage, will you?

194
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:57,308
Our stage is very beautiful. Of course,
we're still under construction.

195
00:14:57,308 --> 00:15:03,248
We also have a small camera
that'll show you the stage construction.

196
00:15:03,248 --> 00:15:07,048
Next, I will take everyone
to tour our surrounding environment.

197
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:11,848
Let's see if we can meet
some big shots in the show. Follow me.

198
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:18,368
Follow me.

199

♪Listening to the tide by the cliff,
admiring stones in the pavilion♪

200
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:27,647
♪Read all the history books for leisure♪

201
00:15:32,407 --> 00:15:34,887
- Which one sounds good?
- The second one.

202
00:15:37,007 --> 00:15:38,668
Mr. Wang Ke, Mr. Feishao.

203
00:15:38,668 --> 00:15:39,728
Take a seat.

204
00:15:39,728 --> 00:15:41,548
- Sit.
- Come on.

205
00:15:41,548 --> 00:15:43,188
Sorry, I only ordered two portions.

206
00:15:43,188 --> 00:15:44,588
It's okay, I'm not hungry.

207
00:15:44,588 --> 00:15:50,367
Thank goodness you came along,
otherwise he'll lose hair.

208
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:54,807
We're about to begin.
Let's shake hands before we start.

209
00:15:55,887 --> 00:15:57,788
We've known each other for so long.
Don't be dramatic.

210
00:15:57,788 --> 00:16:02,948
Come on, Doudou. I'm doing this
out of respect. Right, Sheng?

211
00:16:02,948 --> 00:16:06,168
I got this task on short notice.
I'm afraid I might let you down.

212
00:16:06,168 --> 00:16:09,308
It's okay. Sing with confidence.
I've got your back.

213
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:11,228
Stop it!

214
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:13,988
Don't you still have rice noodles?
Mine were eaten by Mr. Zhu.

215
00:16:13,988 --> 00:16:19,907
Okay, you eat first. We discussed this
during last night's meeting.

216
00:16:19,907 --> 00:16:24,408
We knew you covered this song before,
so we spoke with Qiang Qingci first.

217
00:16:24,408 --> 00:16:27,760
We were going to tell you directly,
but we were too busy.

218
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,688
Yes, we didn't have time.

219
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:31,827
How should I harmonize?

220
00:16:31,827 --> 00:16:38,160
I'm so forgetful. Let me explain it.
After section A1, you can enter in A2.

221
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:44,268
Three pitches higher than me
in the chorus. Then the interval

222
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:46,648
(A White Horse In The Reeds)
is yours. Don't worry. I've checked.

223
00:16:46,648 --> 00:16:47,727
It's within your vocal range.

224
00:16:47,727 --> 00:16:48,868
You'll be fine.

225
00:16:48,868 --> 00:16:59,368
The resting area. Our main vocals,
Feishao, Wang Ke. Guess who she is.

226
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:00,328
Hello.

227
00:17:00,328 --> 00:17:03,428
Yes, our long-lost Momo'er.

228
00:17:03,428 --> 00:17:05,447
They keep mentioning this is Doudoubing.

229
00:17:05,447 --> 00:17:09,527
I know, but isn't she going to perform?
So, Momo'er is more suitable.

230
00:17:10,688 --> 00:17:13,128
By the way, let me
introduce one more person to everyone.

231
00:17:13,128 --> 00:17:14,007
Mo Bai.

232
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,688
She's nervous about the first time
being on stage. Leave her be.

233
00:17:21,408 --> 00:17:27,788
And the last one is me. I wanted to
do chorus for Wang Ke, but he rejected.

234
00:17:27,788 --> 00:17:29,848
Bro, aren't you tone-deaf?

235
00:17:29,848 --> 00:17:32,128
They all know it.
There's no need to emphasize again.

236
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:38,588
All right, I'll take you
to our costume area. Follow me.

237
00:17:38,588 --> 00:17:39,908
Come on, this way.

238
00:17:39,908 --> 00:17:43,688
He's suitable for this.
He's talkative and quick-minded.

239
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:46,448
I've decided.
When should we start rehearsing?

240
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,308
Give me 10 more minutes.
I will take another bite.

241
00:17:50,308 --> 00:17:52,767
It's okay, take your time.
I will go out and practice first.

242
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,668
- Okay, I'll meet you later.
- Okay.

243
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:55,728
- Very soon.
- See you in a bit.

244
00:17:58,248 --> 00:18:03,688
She is a bit like Qiang Qingci,
very calm and devoted.

245
00:18:04,847 --> 00:18:11,168
Yes. When I first took the stage,
I was excited, but she was professional.

246
00:18:18,327 --> 00:18:18,847
Sheng.

247
00:18:20,688 --> 00:18:21,908
Are you not busy?

248
00:18:21,908 --> 00:18:25,427
I saw you chatting there.
I came over to cheer you on.

249
00:18:25,427 --> 00:18:27,908
I'm so nervous.
I've never been on stage before.

250
00:18:27,908 --> 00:18:30,367
I knew it. Look.

251
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:34,128
(Encouragement from the fans)

252
00:18:34,128 --> 00:18:40,588
They're afraid you can't see it.
They said there's no need to be scared.

253
00:18:40,588 --> 00:18:44,648
I'll be with Mao at the control panel.
If you're nervous, just look at me.

254
00:18:44,648 --> 00:18:47,988
Then you'll calm down.
Just like when we're in the school club.

255
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:48,667
Okay.

256
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,168
Go for it.

257
00:18:50,688 --> 00:18:51,208
What's up?

258
00:18:52,728 --> 00:18:54,808
Well, Mr. Feng.

259
00:18:54,808 --> 00:18:58,287
When the stage lights are on,
it's hard to see below.

260
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,248
Leave her alone.
She needs to practice with the lyrics.

261
00:19:05,408 --> 00:19:06,848
Sorry.

262
00:19:06,848 --> 00:19:09,608
Let's go. You do your thing. Go.

263
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,268
Go for it.

264
00:19:11,268 --> 00:19:12,588
You too.

265
00:19:12,588 --> 00:19:13,268
I will.

266
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:13,888
Goodbye.

267
00:19:16,648 --> 00:19:22,327
Left, left. Again. Almost there.

268
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,327
Zhu, it's still not symmetrical.

269
00:19:24,327 --> 00:19:25,287
Wait a moment.

270
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:36,208
Why are you sitting here alone
and not accompanying Sheng?

271
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:41,208
She has her own job to do.
My presence there is of no use.

272
00:19:42,327 --> 00:19:45,567
You can be her emotional support
and give her some guidance.

273
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:55,888
It's her first stage experience.
And she needs to practice more.

274
00:19:55,888 --> 00:20:00,047
It'll be a precious memory.
I don't want to interfere.

275
00:20:01,448 --> 00:20:05,067
Are you not her boyfriend?
Why don't you seem nervous?

276
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:07,728
How do you know I haven't been nervous?

277
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,448
Stop pretending, okay?

278
00:20:11,047 --> 00:20:13,187
Where are you going? Are you worried?

279
00:20:13,187 --> 00:20:14,248
Getting some water.

280
00:20:18,688 --> 00:20:20,128

00:20:57,007 --> 00:20:57,928
Give her a moment.

286
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:05,128
Sorry for upstaging you.
She becomes my partner.

287
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:09,007
You are the singer.
It's right for her to be your partner.

288
00:21:10,688 --> 00:21:12,307
This way, she can learn more.

289
00:21:12,307 --> 00:21:13,648
No.

290
00:21:14,767 --> 00:21:16,728
She's really great.

291
00:21:31,448 --> 00:21:32,728
Are you asking me to go rehearse?

292
00:21:33,928 --> 00:21:40,248
She is focus when it comes to work.
We'll rehearsal soon, bye.

293
00:21:48,168 --> 00:21:50,287
It's okay. Just be calm.

294
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:55,607
Anyway, I think
you'll be fine. Because...

295
00:21:56,728 --> 00:21:57,488
You are the best.

296
00:21:59,047 --> 00:22:00,087
I am the best!

297
00:22:03,007 --> 00:22:03,448
Let's go.

298
00:22:11,448 --> 00:22:17,588
The dubbing actors and singers have
returned to Yuerong Manor.

299
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:23,168
Let's see what they are doing now, okay?
It's very quiet here.

300
00:22:23,168 --> 00:22:28,048
Over there. Isn't there
someone from Perfect Voice?

301
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,768
After this matter has settled,
continue to live as siblings.

302
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:33,767
If I can do treason,
why can't I marry Zhaozhao?

303
00:22:36,047 --> 00:22:38,992
(Live stream interaction)
I can hardly see from the comments.

304
00:22:38,992 --> 00:22:46,488
"Is Qiang Qingci there?"
Keep guessing. Follow me.

305
00:22:46,488 --> 00:22:52,728
I know you want a closer look,
but I won't give you the chance.

306
00:22:55,648 --> 00:22:59,807
(6 hours before the performance)
Good. Nice! Okay, take a break.

307
00:23:00,888 --> 00:23:02,848
Mao, it's ready.

308
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:03,568
Okay.

309
00:23:03,568 --> 00:23:07,312
(Ten years of dreams and love)
The supper is over there.

310
00:23:07,984 --> 00:23:12,868
After that, the final rehearsal.

311
00:23:12,868 --> 00:23:17,567
I know it's hot. Bear with it, okay?
Hurry up and eat, come on.

312
00:23:19,168 --> 00:23:20,308
You got yours, Zheng?

313
00:23:20,308 --> 00:23:21,528
Zhou Zheng, yours?

314
00:23:21,528 --> 00:23:22,408
Yes.

315
00:23:22,408 --> 00:23:23,047
Okay.

316
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:23,888
Share with everyone.

317
00:23:27,728 --> 00:23:28,327
Do you want it?

318
00:23:32,688 --> 00:23:34,847
Leave some for him.
Don't eat them all by yourself.

319
00:23:34,847 --> 00:23:36,068
Is this a steamed bun?

320
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:37,327
It has fillings.

321
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:42,287
The osmanthus cakes Mr. Qiang ordered
taste pretty good.

322
00:23:43,728 --> 00:23:45,628
Just arrived.

323
00:23:45,628 --> 00:23:46,567
Thank you.

324
00:23:54,168 --> 00:23:56,688
I have fallen in love with this place.
Everything here tastes delicious.

325
00:24:00,968 --> 00:24:01,648
Are you nervous?

326
00:24:04,728 --> 00:24:09,327
I don't feel it now, but I will
when they start the one-hour countdown.

327
00:24:11,007 --> 00:24:15,248
It's a good thing.
It means you respect the stage.

328
00:24:16,928 --> 00:24:17,968
You talk like an instructor.

329
00:24:19,007 --> 00:24:19,968
Our chill pill.

330
00:24:21,047 --> 00:24:22,648
Why chill pill?

331
00:24:22,648 --> 00:24:29,728
No matter what we perform,
he'll keep everything in check.

332
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:35,208
What?

333
00:24:36,408 --> 00:24:38,688
Realizing your choice is not bad?

334
00:24:40,007 --> 00:24:41,248
I've always had good taste.

335
00:24:42,928 --> 00:24:44,208
When to do the makeup and get changed?

336
00:24:45,688 --> 00:24:46,668
After a while, maybe.

337
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:48,168
Then I will go and take a look.

338
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:56,768
Please don't.
If you go, I will get nervous.

339
00:24:56,768 --> 00:24:59,228
I haven't seen it. I'd like to see you.

340
00:24:59,228 --> 00:25:01,087
Watch me on the stage, alright?

341
00:25:02,847 --> 00:25:03,287
Okay.

342
00:25:33,847 --> 00:25:36,728
Mao, how is it?
Is there any problem here?

343
00:25:36,728 --> 00:25:39,407
No problem on my side.
How about things over there?

344
00:25:39,407 --> 00:25:43,048
Right. How are the actors now?

345
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:45,807
All actors and singers are in place

We will formally meet afterwards.

00:25:55,108 --> 00:25:56,128
Okay.

349
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:57,888

393
00:29:17,587 --> 00:29:19,087

401
00:30:15,567 --> 00:30:18,448

Come on.

406
00:30:27,728 --> 00:30:31,528
Stop talking, don't make Sheng nervous.
I'm getting a bit nervous here.

407
00:30:31,528 --> 00:30:33,448
It'll reach 50 million
as soon as she's on stage.

408
00:31:04,928 --> 00:31:05,488
Zhaozhao.

409
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:09,928
Brother.

410
00:31:24,087 --> 00:31:25,688
I shouldn't have kept you in Chaisang.

411
00:31:32,847 --> 00:31:33,527
Brother.

412
00:31:35,287 --> 00:31:38,327
Just tell me.

413
00:31:44,888 --> 00:31:45,567
Marry...

414
00:31:50,287 --> 00:31:50,888
Me.

415
00:31:55,888 --> 00:31:57,527
Go find the red cloth.

416
00:32:00,448 --> 00:32:03,828
General, the palace is in chaos.
There's nowhere to find the red cloth.

417
00:32:03,828 --> 00:32:07,388
Go find it. Go!

418
00:32:07,388 --> 00:32:11,448
Here, tonight,

419
00:32:13,648 --> 00:32:14,728
I'll marry Zhaozhao.

420
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:22,008
General, she is your sister in name.
Everyone knows.

421
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,368
So what?

422
00:32:23,368 --> 00:32:32,428
No! Half of those generals are disloyal.
They wanted to rebel. If you do it,

423
00:32:32,428 --> 00:32:33,744
it will just give them an excuse.

424
00:32:34,992 --> 00:32:41,128
The emperor is dead now.
It's your opportunity to seize power!

425
00:32:44,888 --> 00:32:45,728
Go.

426
00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:49,527
Find the red cloth.

427
00:32:55,408 --> 00:32:59,527
I'll leave the realm
to the crown prince.

428
00:33:02,888 --> 00:33:07,567
And I will marry Zhaozhao.

429
00:33:08,648 --> 00:33:14,448
If you want to be with her,
wait until this matter is settled.

430
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:18,607
If I can do treason,
why can't I marry Zhaozhao?

431
00:33:27,248 --> 00:33:32,168
Why must they kill Shen Zhaozhao?

432
00:33:33,408 --> 00:33:38,888
I have millions of soldiers,
but I still can't protect Zhaozhao.

433
00:33:40,287 --> 00:33:41,888
In order to protect me,

434
00:33:42,968 --> 00:33:45,688
she was hidden in our house for year.

435
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:50,968
Afterwards,
she followed me through battles.

436
00:33:52,807 --> 00:33:53,567
And now,

437
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:58,688
she ended her life to protect me.

438
00:34:00,047 --> 00:34:04,968
Can't I at least marry her today?

439
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:25,248
Shen Ce, born into a noble family.

440
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:29,927
Lived humbly with his sister.

441
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:39,152
He was knighted
because of his skills in battle.

442
00:34:40,176 --> 00:34:43,248
The royals feared his ruthlessness
and imprisoned his sister.

443
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:45,296
They wanted him to be controlled.

444
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:51,767
His troop approached the capital,
but his sister took her own life.

445
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:55,568
Ce was infuriated.

446
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:59,248
He set fire to the palace
and assassinated the emperor.

447
00:35:01,688 --> 00:35:03,208
The world was shocked.

448
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:07,568
Rumors has it
that on the day the palace fell,

449
00:35:08,927 --> 00:35:10,807
Shen Ce, on his horse,

450
00:35:12,168 --> 00:35:14,447
left the palace,
carrying a woman in red.

451
00:35:15,487 --> 00:35:18,887
And no traces of them were found since.

452
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:22,608
The realm became leaderless.

453
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:24,807
The South

454
00:35:27,887 --> 00:35:28,767
was in a great chaos.
