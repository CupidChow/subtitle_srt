45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,480

I think they

52
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,200
don't care at all about Nie Chi's thoughts.

53
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,520
Whatever.

54
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,050
As long as Nie Chi cares, that's good.

55
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,360
That's right.

56
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,850
Nie Chi doesn't want to go.

57
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,410
Can they force him to go?

58
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,320
Yeah.

59
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,450
(Force him...)

60
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,080
Mom, can you give me the phone?

61
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,450
No.

62
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,050
We agreed on this before

63
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,390
that you absolutely can't get hurt.

64
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,850
Otherwise, you must stop training.

65
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,330
Now we want you to go abroad,

66
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,170
but you said you still want to practice.

67
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,960
Is everything you said before is in vain?

68
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,410
Injuries among athletes are common.

69
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,800
You can't move in bed.

70
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,130
Is that common?

71
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:29,480
Don't fool me.

72
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,890
I don't know about short track speed skating.

73
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:35,050
But how could I not notice your injuries?

74
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,080
If you keep practicing, you're doomed.

75
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,520
It's the same to recover abroad.

76
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:42,290
You behave well.

77
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:44,480
I will return your phone when we get there.

78
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,570
Excuse me.

79
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,330
Where did the patient in No. 23 go?

80
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,010
He was just taken away by his family.

81
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,520
Excuse me.

82
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,010

83
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,180
Sorry, who are you?

84
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,630
We're the unannounced inspection personnel.

86
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,200

87
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,800
But in here, if one inspection is missed,

88
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,360
you will go back to where you came from.

89

90
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,090
affects not just your performance,

91
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:23,560
but the whole team's,

92
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,650
thereby blackening the national team.

95
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,530
All right.

00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,090

00:08:58,490 --> 00:08:59,370
I suggest

189
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,890
that you respect

190
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,170
Nie Chi's opinion.

191
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,920
I don't understand, Mr. Li.

192
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:06,770
Nie Chi is already injured like this.

193
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:07,840
Why do you, Lin Ge,

194
00:09:07,890 --> 00:09:09,200
and all the people in your team

195
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,800
still let him continue practicing?

196
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:12,570
He can't even walk now.

197
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:14,050
How could he practice?

198
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,170
Let me put it this way.

199
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:18,010
In short track speed skating,

200
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:20,130
the waist, knees, and ankles

201
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,330
are the most easily injured areas.

202
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:23,200
I have been a coach for so many years.

203
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,960
Eight out of ten athletes

204
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:27,320
have knee injuries.

205
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,920
Nie Chi's situation is not the most severe.

206
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,200
He is very likely to recover.

207
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,130
You just say words that sound good.

208
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,530
It's not like that.

209
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,100
This is the conclusion of medical experts.

210
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,770
As the head coach of the national team,

211
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,920
I take responsibility for every player.

212
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,890
If Nie Chi just gives up like this,

213
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
it's really a pity.

214
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,410
Nie Chi is lying in the bed, unable to move.

215
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,920
We care about him the most.

216
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,170
I am also a parent.

217
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,840
I can feel your pain.

218
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,720
Let's think from a different perspective.

219
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:03,650
If you force someone

220
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,500
to give up his dreams

221
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,170
and do things that he doesn't like,

222
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:10,600
isn't this person even more pitiful?

223
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:11,720
All right, all right.

224
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,720
Don't talk to me about dreams.

225
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,500
Children's dreams are all fanciful.

226
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,370
Only by sending him abroad now

227
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:19,530
to receive a better education

228
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,440
can he have a better future.

229
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:28,200
For parents, children are always children.

230
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:31,170
But Nie Chi has already grown up.

231
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,530
He has the right to choose his own life.

232
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,290
I still have that suggestion.

233
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:39,840
Listen to his thoughts more.

234
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:49,370
You tell me

235
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,440
what we should do now.

236
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,080
Where are you going to go?

237
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:00,920
Mr. Li, we are going to check on you.

238
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,530
We're afraid you can't persuade them.

239
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:05,250
What will you I do if I can't?

240
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,920
Are you planning to run away again?

241
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,370
It's not impossible.

242
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,210
You...

243
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:11,840
Let's go back to the team.

244
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,840
What about Nie Chi?

245
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,250
He will be in the hospital.

246
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,370
Where else can he go?

247
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:18,440
Won't he go abroad?

248
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,680
Nie Chi, we gotta go.

249
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,680
You rest well.

250
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,840
- Ok.
- As for your parents,

251
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,890
talk to them properly.

252
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,170
Thank you, Mr. Li.

253
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,200
Thank me when you can stay.

254
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,520
I will do my best.

255
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,040
We're off.

256
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,370
Come on.

257
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,410
What specific exercises need to be done?

258
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:02,080
At this stage,

259
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,410
the key is to rehabilitate his knee

260
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,960
back to a level

261
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:05,920
for daily activities.

262
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,890
What should we pay attention to?

263
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:09,320
At the early stage of rehabilitation,

264
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,010
he will definitely feel pain.

265
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,250
Especially the injured area.

266
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:14,560
He should avoid large bending movements.

267
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:16,370
Is there any way

268
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:17,530
to recover a bit faster?

269
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,530
Rehabilitation training can't be rushed.

270
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,650
It needs to be done step by step.

271
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:22,680
If you want to help him recover faster,

272
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,250
you can conduct rehabilitation training

273
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,840
for uninjured areas

274
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,080
to prevent muscle wasting.

275
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:28,330
Secondly,

276
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:31,050
conduct appropriate cardio training

277
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,010
to maintain good physical function.

278
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,170
Chi, time to eat.

279
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,530
I brought you some bone broth

280
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,680
to nourish your body.

281
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,720
I can't drink this soup.

282
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,170
This was not bought outside.

283
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,530
I brewed it at home.

284
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,600
I also selected the bones personally.

285
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,490
I knew you need to eat light food

286
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,330
after the surgery,

287
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,720
so I only added a bit of salt

288
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,920
and didn't put anything else in it.

289
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,050
Not because of this.

290
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,410
Your mom simmered soup all afternoon

291
00:13:02,530 --> 00:13:03,890
to nourish you.

292
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,650
Can't you even take a sip?

293
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,050
Dad, Mom,

294
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,890
you may not know

295
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:15,410
that one positive drug test

296
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:17,560
may affect the entire career of an athlete.

297
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,920
So athletes must be very cautious

298
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,440
about the food they eat.

299
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:23,650
Because of this,

300
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,080
I haven't eaten the meat

301
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,170
outside for many years.

302
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,320
I haven't taken good care

303
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,440
of you all these years.

304
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,600
I didn't even know these things.

305
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,050
It's not that.

306
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,890
I should apologize to you.

307
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,490
I've made you anxious these days.

308
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,130
Actually, I deceived you when I promised

309
00:13:54,410 --> 00:13:55,650
that I wouldn't get hurt.

310
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:57,170
As an athlete,

311
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,290
it's inevitable to have injuries.

312
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,960
But the reason I insist on this

313
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,080
is that I learned it from you.

314
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,250
I remember when I was very young,

315
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,130
Dad was unemployed

316
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,170
and he took the only savings

317
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,250
to go into business.

318
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,720
That's why we have our good days now.

319
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,720
Dad, you know what?

320
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,440
Actually, you are my idol.

321
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:31,650
Back then,

322
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,890
I was taking a gamble.

323
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:37,440
It's different from your situation.

324
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,600
We have good living conditions now.

325
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,960
Mom and Dad will fully support you

326
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:44,530
to study at a well-known school abroad.

327
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,830
In this way

328
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,090
you will have a better future, right?

329
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,440
I know all this.

330
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,290
And I also know many people

331
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,800
advised you not to act impulsively.

332
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,010
But you still made your own choice.

333
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,080
I also don't want to disappoint my dreams

334
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,560
and the people who love me.

335
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,800
So...

336
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:07,650
So please let me be stubborn once.

337
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,340
(Honorary Champion Wall)

338
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,320
(Apartment)

339
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,650
- Lin Ge.
- Gao Kai.

340
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,170
How is Nie Chi recovering?

341
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,040
A bit better.

342
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:31,970
But not so quickly.

343
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,520
Don't worry.

344
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,400
As the saying goes,

345
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:36,680
it needs a long time to recover.

346
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,290
All right, thank you.

347
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,450
I gotta go.

348
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,580
Gao Kai,

349
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,680
I have a question to ask you.

350
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,130
Many business people add me on WeChat.

351
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:48,720
I am not experienced.

352
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,250
I don't know how to refuse them.

353
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,770
Aren't you short on money?

354
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:52,920
Why refuse?

355
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,290
This season is quite important to me.

356
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,680
I can't be distracted anymore.

357
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,290
Just be courteous.

358
00:17:00,920 --> 00:17:01,880
Give yourself some leeway.

359
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,410
Thank them first.

360
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,490
Say you'll focus more on the competition

361
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:07,200
and you may cooperate in the future.

362
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,080
All right, thank you.

363
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,330
Keep it up.

364
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,640
Lin Ge. Lin Ge.

365
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:21,450
What's up? What happened to Nie Chi?

366
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,400
It's not Nie Chi.

367
00:17:22,490 --> 00:17:25,250
Someone claims to be your town fellow

368
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,840
and insists on seeing you.

369
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:27,810
I don't know what's going on.

370
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:29,310
My town fellow?

371
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,320
Are you looking for me?

372
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,450
It's Lin Feng's sister, right?

373
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:41,820
I'm Wu Jie, Lin Feng's friend.

374
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,690
Do you still remember me?

375
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,840
When you just got home in your teens,

376
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,970
I stopped you with Lin Feng

377
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,010
and you scratched my face.

378
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,140
You don't look like a good person.

379
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,930
I don't remember. Get to the point.

380
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:53,990
Lin Feng is hospitalized.

381
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,250
He needs to undergo surgery now.

382
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,560
But no one signs it right now.

383
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:58,010
I really have no way.

384
00:17:58,150 --> 00:17:59,930
I remember he has a sister in Beijing.

385
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:00,980
You are his sister.

386
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,110
The hospital will allow you to sign.

387
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,120
I'm not going.

388
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,790
I have no relationship with that family.

389
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:05,880
Ask his grandma to sign it.

390
00:18:06,970 --> 00:18:07,810
What are you doing?

391
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:09,800
He is currently in the hospital.

392
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,080
He needs to undergo surgery now.

393
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:11,920
His family must sign it.

394
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,760
How can I have time to find his grandma?

395
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:16,010
Who knows if what you said is true?

396
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,690
If you are really Lin Feng's friend,

397
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,690
you should know

398
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:20,050
how his family treated Lin Ge.

399
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:20,930
How could you come here?

400
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,600
- It's a matter of life and death.
- What are you doing?

401
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,730
What are you doing?

402
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,290
Who are you?

403
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,330
What's going on, Lin Ge?

404
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,490
Her brother is now in the hospital.

405
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:34,290
He needs to undergo surgery and has no money.

406
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,640
I really have no way.

407
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,080
Her brother? What surgery?

408
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,930
Lin Feng and I work at a construction site.

409
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,320
Lin Feng fell from the scaffold

410
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,450
and was pierced by a rebar.

411
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,320
Just come with me to take a look.

412
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,560
Just take a look.

413
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,450
Is Lin Feng's family here?

414
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,800
Lin Feng's family.

415
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,800
- Doctor, this is his sister.
- Lin Feng's family?

416
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,120
All right.

417
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,050
Doctors from related departments

418
00:18:58,050 --> 00:18:59,150
conducted a consultation for him.

419
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
Lin Feng's current situation

420
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,170
definitely requires surgery

421
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,930
to remove the steel bar.

422
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,010
Do you agree with this plan?

423
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:06,050
- Agree.
- All right.

424
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,560
Once the test results come out,

425
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,550
the surgery can be performed.

426
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,930
The doctor performing the surgery

427
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:11,080
will talk to you again shortly.

428
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,050
Do as you say, doctor.

429
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:13,290
All right, then come with me.

430
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,730
Let her stay here, ok?

431
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,530
- Ok.
- Let's go.

432
00:19:17,930 --> 00:19:19,290
Call his grandma first

433
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,840
and explain the situation to her.

434
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,770
If she needs me to sign,

435
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,610
then I will sign.

436
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,250
In case something happens in the end,

437
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,690
she will blame it on me.

438
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,120
I've already made the calls,

439
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,320
but his grandma didn't pick up.

440
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,250
Call her as she said.

441
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,320
Don't dilly-dally.

442
00:19:48,530 --> 00:19:49,370
Manager.

443
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,000
Lin Ge.

444
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:53,250
I talked to the doctor about his situation.

445
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,090
The surgery cost,

446
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,770
including the follow-up treatment costs,

447
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,190
is not low.

448
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,130
I've paid the money in advance.

449
00:19:59,690 --> 00:20:00,530
No.

450
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,010
You said that the cost is not low.

451
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,930
I have to find a way myself.

452
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,730
Will you tell Nie Chi about this?

453
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,560
Don't tell him for now.

454
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
Don't tell the others when you get back.

455
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,690
You can not tell others.

456
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:25,290
Why don't you tell Nie Chi either?

457
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,120
He's working hard on rehabilitation.

458
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,360
He is already under a lot of pressure.

459
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,120
I can't help anything with him,

460
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,290
I shouldn't add to his troubles.

461
00:20:38,290 --> 00:20:39,130
Fine.

462
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,600
I've been busy with training these days

463
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,600
and haven't had time to see you.

464
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,700
(Lin Ge)

465
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,440
It's ok.

466
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,690
I have been recovering well these days.

467
00:20:59,290 --> 00:21:00,160
Focus on your training.

468
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,120
I miss you very much.

469
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:09,810
Me too.

470
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,450
Don't be too anxious.

471
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,320
Listen to the doctor.

472
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,140
(Lin Ge)

473
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,730
Don't be anxious in your training.

474
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:32,450
If there's anything, remember to tell me.

475
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,530
Ok. Good night and sweet dreams.

476
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,020
Good night and sweet dreams.

477
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,940
(National Ice Sports Base)

478
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,720
Lin Ge.

479
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,930
Well, I need to tell you something.

480
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,800
Your grandma

481
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,490
has passed away.

482
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,490
The neighborhood handled the funeral.

483
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,320
I originally wanted my dad

484
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,010
to go to her place to get the money

485
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,010
for Lin Feng's surgery back.

486
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,400
But in the end,

487
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,010
my dad didn't receive a penny,

488
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,320
but spent over 1,000 funeral expenses.

489
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,160
That's Master's style.

490
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,970
What do you plan to do next?

491
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,050
With Lin Feng's situation,

492
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,930
even after the surgery is done,

493
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:53,880
he won't recover in a short time.

494
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,800
We can't earn much anyway.

495
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,930
You have spent all of your money, huh?

496
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:02,560
No worries. I still have some money...

497
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,080
Don't worry about money.

498
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:06,160
Don't tell your dad and mom either.

499
00:23:09,010 --> 00:23:10,320
I will think of a solution myself.

500
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,450
Sorry, I'm late.

501
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,050
It's ok. I just arrived too.

502
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,250
Their food don't contain

503
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:19,640
illegal additives.

504
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,800
You should be able to eat it, right?

505
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,250
I can try a little bit.

506
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:25,120
Mainly because the calories are too high.

507
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:27,800
About the live broadcast,

508
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,930
how have you considered it?

509
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:30,050
I'm really sorry.

510
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,800
Our team is collaborating with a brand.

511
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,080
It should be your competitor.

512
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,290
I'm afraid I can't do it.

513
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,970
Don't reject me so quickly.

514
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,080
We can't make it clear over WeChat,

515
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,360
so I want to meet and talk.

516
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:42,330
First of all,

517
00:23:42,490 --> 00:23:43,880
the part you are involved in

518
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,160
doesn't involve brand promotion or sales.

519
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,250
This is a co-branded

520
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,640
charity activity that we are doing

521
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,120
together with the chamber of commerce.

522
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,290
We come to you

523
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:53,840
because we hope you can

524
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:55,560
support our products as a star.

525
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:56,770
You just need to say a few words.

526
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,720
Secondly,

527
00:23:58,290 --> 00:24:00,690
in terms of price, we are very sincere.

528
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:01,730
You can take a look.

529
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,010
(100,000 yuan)
We know about the competitor.

530
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,120
But after the World Championship,

531
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,800
your contract with them should be expired.

532
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:12,640
The live broadcast

533
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,800
is before the World Championship, right?

534
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,120
We say it is a live broadcast,

535
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:17,690
but in fact, it is pre-recorded.

536
00:24:17,770 --> 00:24:19,360
We invite you to our company

537
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,010
to shoot a video,

538
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,020
and we broadcast it when the time comes.

539
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,380
See, there is a time on it.

540
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,550
(Broadcast time)
It's stated clearly.

541
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:28,690
It is after the World Championship, right?

542
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,480
Moreover,

543
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,360
we have four or five candidates.

544
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:34,210
But I come to you first.

545
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,600
We have been in contact before.

546
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:36,970
And I especially like you.

547
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:39,050
I really want to give you this opportunity.

548
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:41,120
Thank you.

549
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,360
Can I take this contract

550
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,290
back to have a look at it?

551
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:45,490
I'm willing to let you take it back.

552
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,010
But my colleague

553
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:48,320
is also in contact with others.

554
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,450
If they sign it first,

555
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,870
I might not be able to wait for you.

556
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,000
Well...

557
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:03,010
I heard your brother is having surgery.

558
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,660
It must have cost a lot of money.

559
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:06,400
How do you know?

560
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,770
I am the PR for the brand.

561
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:08,970
I did some research.

562
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,320
But you can rest assured.

563
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,380
I would never tell others

564
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,000
about this matter.

565
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:18,640
Don't worry.

566
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,600
It must be after the World Championship.

567
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:27,460
(Live broadcast cooperation contract)

568
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,930
keep it up!

569
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,250
Mr. Li, I'm sorry.

570
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,190
What's the use of an apology?

571
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,250
What is the qualifying round?

572
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,490
It is to qualify for the next round.

573
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:48,050
What did you do?

574
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,600
To compete for first place in the group,

575
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,840
you can't make it to the 1,000m semifinal.

576
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,460
What I'm thinking is to achieve first place,

577
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:56,800
I can stand on the innermost lane next round.

578
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,640
What about now?

579
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,630
Where can you stand? In your dream?

580
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,330
How is your injury?

581
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:09,530
I can hold on.

582
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,880
Tomorrow, the 500m semifinal and final

583
00:26:19,050 --> 00:26:20,120
will still be led by Xie Lingwei.

584
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,290
- Mr. Li...
- You're not convinced, huh?

585
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,880
You tell me who should be the main force.

586
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:46,730
Zhu Zhu.

587
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,840
Let me help you to the team doctor.

588
00:26:51,770 --> 00:26:53,600
Doctor, I'm leaving.

589
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:54,640
Ok, have a good rest.

590
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,250
Prepare well for tomorrow's match.

591
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,440
Doctor,

592
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,010
is my leg injury getting worse again?

593
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,730
Just tell me directly.

594
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,850
I can handle it.

595
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,160
Wait until the coach and manager get here.

596
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:19,050
Is there really no way?

597
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:22,290
Yes, surgery is the only option.

598
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:24,560
Give me an injection.

599
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,160
I've made my decision.

600
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:27,690
Nonsense!

601
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:33,360
Li, say something.

602
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:34,760
Mr. Li,

603
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,400
only I made it to the next round of 1,000m.

604
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,770
We can't give up the gold medal, huh?

605
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,640
Moreover, if I don't compete this time,

606
00:27:45,490 --> 00:27:46,930
I don't even know if I have a chance

607
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:47,770
in the next match.

608
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:58,400
Mr. Li.

609
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,400
Go ahead.

610
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,800
Zhu Zhu stays in the lead.

611
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,800
Cross the line. Zhu Zhu is the champion.

612
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,560
An unexpected incident happened.

613
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,600
Zhu Zhu fell down.

614
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:19,770
The fall after the match

615
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,640
may be due to her exerting

616
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,360
too much effort during the match.

617
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,120
Hope she is fine.

618
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,990
(Beijing Station)

619
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,400
But for veteran Zhu Zhu,

620
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,880
this is another highlight moment

621
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,450
in her career.

622
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:43,440

the women's 500m final.

642
00:29:38,690 --> 00:29:41,250
Please start warming up

643
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,730
immediately.

644
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,880
The final is about to start.

645
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,740
(Beijing Yuefei officially announced

646
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,500
(that Lin Ge has become)

647
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,740
(the new brand spokesperson.)

648
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:01,290
Lin Ge, you took on the endorsement?

649
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,060
(Lin Ge has become the new spokesperson.)

650
00:30:06,490 --> 00:30:07,970
Why did they announce it?

651
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:10,360
When did you take on the endorsement?

652
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,290
Shouldn't it be announced after the match?

653
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,290
At such a critical moment,

654
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,640
how can you do that?

655
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,160
Don't worry.

656
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,160
It must be after the World Championship.

657
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,840
The match has not yet started.

658
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,690
The camera is on the head coach

659
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:30,210
Li Haifeng and two athletes.

660
00:30:30,210 --> 00:30:31,070
How are you preparing?

661
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
- Mr. Li.
- Li Haifeng should

662
00:30:32,090 --> 00:30:33,620
- Mr. Li.
- be giving them some reminders.

663
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,800
- What happened to you two?
- Yes.

664
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,200
So serious.

665
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,970
Put aside all distractions,

666
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:45,120
don't think about anything and stay calm.

667
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,450
Have you memorized the tactics?

668
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,160
Xie Lingwei tries to get first place.

669
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:51,080
Lin Ge, be ready to provide cover.

670
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,890
Get ready.

671
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,290
Please prepare for your entrance.

672
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:38,630
Go, Team China!

673
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,130
Wei,

674
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,530
let's rely on our own abilities this time, ok?

675
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,600
Ready.

676
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,450
Very good.

677
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:30,930
Lin Ge is still firmly holding the position

678
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,450
for Xie Lingwei.

679
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,530
Is there a change in tactics?

680
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,050
Lin Ge overtook Xie Lingwei.

681
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:46,080
Xie Lingwei fell off the track.

682
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,450
The European player overtook Xie Lingwei

683
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,080
and collided with her.

684
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:58,560
Hold on, Lin Ge.

685
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,560
Xie Lingwei, speed up.

686
00:33:07,690 --> 00:33:08,770
There is one last lap left.

687
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,600
Hang in there, Lin Ge.

688
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,930
(It's my first time to see the rink this way.)

689
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,010
(Perhaps it will be the last time.)

690
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:44,900
(National Ice Sports Base)

691
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,360
Mr. Li asked me to give this to you.

692
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,540
(Songbei)

693
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:57,850
Take care.

694
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:04,050
(Songbei)
(Some people compare life to a bowl.)

695
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,600
(As long as you hit the bottom,)

696
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,330
(any direction you go is uphill.)

697
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:10,490
(If that's really the case,)

698
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,050
(then my life)

699
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,160
(is probably a bottomless broken bowl.)

700
00:34:14,450 --> 00:34:16,050
(I keep falling deeper.)

701
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:18,410
(New troubles are always waiting for me.)

702
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:21,810
(I can't hate anyone.)

703
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,450
(And I have to keep dodging.)

704
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,680
(The person whom I should say goodbye)

705
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,930
(is the one I can't face.)

706
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:30,140
(Room 306)

707
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,280
Nie Chi, bad news.

708
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,400
Lin Ge...

709
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:36,050
Lin Ge was returned to the provincial team

710
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:36,890
by the coach.

711
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:39,650
What are you doing?

712
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:40,760
I will go find Lin Ge.

713
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,600
Are you crazy?

714
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:42,530
How are you going like this?

715
00:34:42,810 --> 00:34:43,810
I don't care.

716
00:34:43,810 --> 00:34:45,000
I can't let her go back alone.

717
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,600
Ok, I'll go with you.

718
00:34:46,970 --> 00:34:47,970
What are you doing?

719
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,810
Nurse, I want to leave the hospital now.

720
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,680
How is that possible?

721
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,050
You're not fully recovered yet.

722
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:54,180
I have an urgent matter. I want to leave now.

723
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:56,600
Then I'll ask the director first.

724
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,170
Slow down, slow down.

725
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:05,600
- It's from Lin Ge.
- Read it.

726
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,440
I have returned to the provincial team.

727
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,680
Sorry. I didn't say goodbye to you in person.

728
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,640
I'm feeling very confused right now.

729
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,490
I want to be alone for a while.

730
00:35:17,050 --> 00:35:18,050
Don't worry about me.

731
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,970
I will take good care of myself.

732
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:22,640
Do the rehabilitation well.

733
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,160
Hope you get better soon.

734
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:31,200
