You even drugged his food.

28
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:41,950

(Happy New Life)
For our promise.

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,760
Let's join the national team together

36
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:57,050
and become world champions.

37
00:01:57,730 --> 00:01:59,690
I'll be with you.

38
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,450

It's from our hometown.

43
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,610
Please take care of Zhu.

44
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,480
I can't take this.

45
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,050
Just a box of fruits. Just take it.

46
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,890
Yes.

47
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,850
Only a box of fruits?

48
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,850
Yes, only fruits...

49
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,410
Give it to Zhu.

50
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,920
As for the national team,

51
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,130
everyone is equal.

52
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,080
The fruits

53
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,480
won't change my judgment of Zhu.

54
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,570
This...

55
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,130
Ms. Han.

56
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,560
- Let's go.
- What are you doing?

57
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,450
Let's go!

58
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,730
- You...
- What are you doing?

59
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,730
We're leaving.

60
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,130
Go on with your work.

61
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,480
Don't come here again.

62
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,850
If it wasn't for you,

63
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,010
why would we do this?

64
00:03:04,290 --> 00:03:05,800
Your coach is ten years younger than us,

65
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,240
and we need to beg her.

66
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,800
Did I ask you to do it?

67
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,050
Hasn't Ms. Han made it clear?

68
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,450
Gifts won't change anything.

69
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:13,410
Do you believe that?

70
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,730
It's a lie.

71
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,050
Maybe she took someone else's gift

72
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,080
and couldn't take ours.

73
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,080
Or maybe

74
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,050
we asked the wrong person.

75
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,410
I won't do it. It's embarrassing.

76
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,330
- Hello, Jinting.
- Hello.

77
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,200
Chao Jinting?

78
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,760
- Auntie.
- Why are you back?

79
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,290
It's spring break, so I came back.

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,410
Is everything going well on the team?

81
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,290
Everything's fine.

82
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,760
Oh, do you have Li Haifeng's number?

83
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,640
Our coach?

84
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,520
I do, but...

85
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,480
Let's go. Ignore her.

86
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,290
Hey, what are you doing?

87
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,450
Who do you take after?

88
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,690
Slow down. She didn't come.

89
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:52,050
Had a fight?

90
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,010
Don't ask.

91
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,520
How long will you stay?

92
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,640
A week.

93
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,680
I'll race with you in a week.

94
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,760
1000 meters.

95
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,170
How's your knee?

96
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,410
Ms. Han told me.

97
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:04,200
I saw a doctor.

98
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:05,200
It's broken,

99
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,080
but it doesn't matter.

100
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,130
So stubborn.

101
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,620
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

102
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:20,250
Ready.

103
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:48,240
Did you come back with Chao Jinting

104
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,170
to visit us?

105
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,650
I'm not that bored.

106
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,920
Ms. Han asked us to train the juniors.

107
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,680
You're lying.

108
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
Why did Zhu choose 1000m?

109
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,850
Jinting is a long-distance skater,
but Zhu isn't.

110
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:04,240
They can only compete in 1000m.

111
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,880
I also want to compete with Jinting.

112
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,440
Zhu is using a trailing tactic.

113
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,800
Jinting is blocking the wind,

114
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,210
and Zhu can save her energy.

115
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,880
Zhu's endurance
is not as good as Jinting's.

116
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,170
That's true.

117
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,800
Why is Jinting getting

118
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,880
faster and faster?

119
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,650
How does the national team
train athletes?

120
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,680
She was definitely slower than Zhu
when she left.

121
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,440
It's only been a year,

122
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,970
and now Zhu is struggling
to keep up with her.

123
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:54,680
She can't win.
If I were her, I'd give up.

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,290
Jinting's performance is quite stable.

125
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,840
Zhu!

126
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,720
Check on her!

127
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,770
Come on. Let's go.

128
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,240
How's your leg? Are you okay?

129
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,240
Ding Yi,

130
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,730
sent her to the hospital.

131
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:52,770
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

132
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,050
Your bursitis is very serious.

133
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:15,610
You need a surgery.

134
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,920
Why didn't you do it?

135
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:22,210
Doctor, I can't have surgery now.

136
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,880
How about conservative treatment?

137
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,000
I have an important competition.

138
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,850
More important than your leg?

139
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,480
You have to get a surgery.

140
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,410
Conservative treatment

141
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,050
requires you to rest for three months.

142
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,560
Three months?

143
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,240
It'll pass very quickly.

144
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,120
I'll go to the canteen

145
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,970
to make bone soup for you every day.

146
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:52,850
You'll recover very soon.

147
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:54,690
Go away.

148
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,410
No, I can't.

149
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,290
You're injured.

150
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,680
I have to take you back.

151
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:00,810
Huang Han.

152
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,440
Leave me alone.

153
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,840
Go away.

154
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,410
Juniors, keep it up.

155
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,920
Learn from Zhu's spirit.

156
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,200
Lin Ge.

157
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,840
What are you thinking?

158
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,520
Well,

159
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,360
Zhu knew the competition was coming.

160
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,410
Why did she try so hard

161
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,390
for the race?

162
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,920
The only explanation is that

163
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,290
she treats every competition as proof

164
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:39,130
of getting into the national team.

165
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:46,200
Coach, how's Zhu?

166
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,560
Old injury.
She needs to rest for three months.

167
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,560
Three months?

168
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,400
That's so serious.

169
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,960
Your bursitis is very serious.

170
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:00,490
You need a surgery.

171
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,680
Doctor, I can't have surgery now.

172
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,560
How about conservative treatment?

173
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:06,650
Conservative treatment

174
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:08,170
requires you to rest for three months.

(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

176
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
Zhu.

177
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:19,050
Zhu.

178
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,010
Han asked me to bring you some food.

179
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,290
Maybe she's not here.

180
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,160
She is.

181
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,960
I'm Jinting.

182
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,800
I'll get the door.

183
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,160
Don't!

184
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,720
I'm here to see you.

185
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,170
What's wrong?

186
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:47,970
We can't be friends
after the competition?

187
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,520
Can I talk to you for a second?

188
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:51,440
Go back to your team.

189
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,650
Wait for me there.

190
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:56,720
Fine, I'll wait for you.

191
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,050
Yao, you're a snitch.

192
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:11,320
I only told you.

193
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,560
Why did you bring Ge?

194
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,290
She's going to join the national team.

195
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,010
You'll be teammates.

196
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,670
Besides, she also needs

197
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,200
to say goodbye to her idol Gao Kai.

198
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,440
Lin Ge, work hard.

199
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,080
If we become a Winter Olympics host,

200
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,200
skating will be crucial.

201
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,800
Don't slack off.

202
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,490
There are many talents
in other provinces.

203
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:30,130
Okay, I'll try my best.

204
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:35,110
Yao, take care of Zhu.

205
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,200
Don't worry.

206
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,150
You're so early.

207
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,490
We should leave secretly.

208
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,080
Why are they here?

209
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,290
Charmer, if it wasn't for you,

210
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:47,130
would we have to sneak out like thieves?

211
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:49,050
However, they didn't come for you

212
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,100
but me.

213
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,960
When did you become friends

214
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,530
with them?

215
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,560
It's early in the morning.

216
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,920
It's not about them.
I want to see Lin Ge.

217
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:03,290
She's seeing off our senior sister.

218
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:04,530
Why do you care?

219
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,490
Maybe she's here for the senior brother.

220
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:10,080
They'll leave together.

221
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
What's the difference?

222
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,330
See?

223
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:17,560
No matter how hard we try to hide it,

224
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:18,800
they'll see us off.

225
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,800
I'm not here for you.

226
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,320
See? Not for you.

227
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,010
Is this brat always so rude?

228
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,920
Why do I feel like

229
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,560
you want me to leave?

230
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,170
Just because I won?

231
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,170
So vengeful.

232
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:41,010
Wait.

233
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,800
You're not vengeful.

234
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:45,130
You want my attention.

235
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,530
Luckily, I'm kind-hearted.

236
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,560
You're welcome.

237
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,770
Work hard.

238
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,140
Bye.

239
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,050
We're leaving. Bye.

240
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:07,290
Bye.

241
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:18,420
Give it to me.

242
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,530
Did you hear me?

243
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,120
- Both the senior
- Give me!

244
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,690
- and the junior are childish.
- No.

245
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,770
Who are you talking about?
Who's childish?

246
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,290
You're childish.

247
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,130
I want to sleep.

248
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,370
Brat.

249
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,900
The International Olympic Committee
has the honor to announce

250
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,640
the host of the Olympic Winter Games 2022.

251
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,660
(News, Live)

252
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,290
Beijing.

253
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:09,650
Amazing! We did it!

254
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,840
Amazing!

255
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,230
We did it!

256
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,410
You're so lucky.

257
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,720
Olympic Games in your homeland.

258
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:40,170
It's every athlete's dream.

259
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,050
It's the highest honor

260
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,530
and the most stressful times.

261
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,410
At this point, you must stay calm.

262
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,160
Now,

263
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:53,200
the Olympiad of Beijing 2022
Winter Olympics has officially begun.

264
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,290
I have a special announcement

265
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:02,950
to share with you.

266
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,290
Yesterday, ISU issued new regulations.

267
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,370
Putting the tip of the blade
in the ice is an offense.

268
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:10,880
Both feet must be on the ice surface.

269
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,490
Why did they suddenly change it?

270
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,650
- It applies to everyone.
- We need to start over.

271
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,600
Please respect the change
and adjust to it.

272
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,370
All of you need to change

273
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,890
the way to start,

274
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,650
but it's more important

275
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,410
to the short-distance skaters

276
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,530
who rely on a quick start.

277
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:28,250
Old member Huang Han

278
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,960
and new members Nie Chi and Lin Ge,

279
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,720
you have to pay attention.

280
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,650
This year's Starlight Cup

281
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
is an important stage
for the national team

282
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,800
to select candidates.

283
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,770
We don't have much time.

284
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,050
In this Starlight Cup,

285
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:45,490
whoever adapts to the new starting rule

286
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,890
will dominate the 500m event.

287
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:57,720
Coach, I don't want
to miss the Starlight Cup.

288
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:01,080
You're injured. How can you
change your starting method?

289
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,800
I suggest you

290
00:15:02,930 --> 00:15:04,410
rest for a few more days.

291
00:15:04,690 --> 00:15:07,050
Coach, I know myself well.

292
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:08,640
Just go back.

293
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,210
Coach,

294
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,080
when I came here, why didn't you

295
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,600
ask me to correct my posture

296
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:19,800
and build a foundation like Lin Ge did?

297
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:20,840
Why did you send me

298
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,530
to competitions immediately?

299
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:24,080
They say an experienced coach

300
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,130
can easily tell

301
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:26,440
if an athlete is talented.

302
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,010
They protect the talented athletes

303
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,130
and send them to the national team,

304
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,650
but the ordinary ones can only
rely on hard work.

305
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,600
You knew I was ordinary,

306
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:37,970
so you sent me to competitions, right?

307
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,640
Sorry.

308
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,570
I shouldn't have doubted you

309
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,580
or been jealous of my new teammate.

310
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,170
You did well in 500m today.

311
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,720
You surpassed Zhu's result
when she defeated you

312
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,490
in the youth training camp.

313
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,200
I need to be faster.

314
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,560
Getting into the Starlight Cup
is not enough.

315
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,530
Besides, Zhu didn't

316
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:24,770
try her best.

317
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,050
It's okay. We still have time.

318
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:29,530
But we need proper training.

319
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:30,720
Tomorrow, I...

320
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,600
What? I'll keep practicing.

321
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,840
If you don't want to come,

322
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,680
I'll do it myself.

323
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:42,250
Is your foot injured?

324
00:16:44,270 --> 00:16:45,490
Not my foot. It's my leg.

325
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,560
Maybe I pushed myself too hard.

326
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:48,730
Don't worry.

327
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,850
Today?

328
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,840
It's been a few days,

329
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,490
but it was severe today.

330
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,440
Here?

331
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:11,930
Was the squatting angle wrong?

332
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,640
I don't think so.

333
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,160
Ms. Han said I'd corrected it.

334
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:20,810
Let's go back.

335
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:27,540
(Comprehensive Training Hall)

336
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,970
Can you handle it?

337
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,210
Yes, coach.

338
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,480
Work hard.

339
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,050
If you can be faster

340
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,160
than 45 seconds for 500m,

341
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,290
you might get into singles.

342
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,450
I'll go back to training!

343
00:17:55,010 --> 00:17:55,850
Zhu.

344
00:17:59,080 --> 00:17:59,930
Zhu.

345
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,930
I'm Huang Han.

346
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,450
Are you feeling better?

347
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,880
Does it hurt?

348
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,080
Can you open the door?

349
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,340
(Zhu's Meal)

350
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:20,680
Zhu,

351
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:22,560
I brought you some food.

352
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:25,160
Stewed dishes.

353
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,970
I made them.

354
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,210
Listen,

355
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,490
my cooking is getting better.

356
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,600
You look tired.

357
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,210
Did Ms. Han increase your training load?

358
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,120
An extra set of technical skating.

359
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,050
20 laps.

360
00:18:58,450 --> 00:18:59,450
I wish

361
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,250
I could have 48 hours a day.

362
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,010
Han,

363
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,050
did you bring food to Zhu?

364
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,320
Didn't you see her?

365
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,640
I wanted to.

366
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:13,530
It's my pleasure.

367
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,400
I'll come tomorrow.

368
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:18,600
Han

369
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:20,530
is so faithful.

370
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,290
I feel like I need more time.

371
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:28,320
It's good that Ms. Han
increased your training load,

372
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,690
which means she values you.

373
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:31,810
She also said

374
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,050
if I can get faster,

375
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,050
she'll let me compete in singles.

376
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,080
That's great.

377
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,400
You need to work hard.

378
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,840
You're close to success.

379
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,080
I came back to charge my phone.

380
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,600
I'll go back for extra training later.

381
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,530
Well done.

382
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,640
I really envy you.

383
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,450
You can have type I meals.

384
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,120
Lin Ge,

385
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,800
since we won the relay championship,

386
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:01,770
have we ever let you have type II meals?

387
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,530
It's different.

388
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,290
If I can earn it by myself,

389
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,450
it'll be more delicious.

390
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,080
You'll have type I meals soon.

391
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,290
Yes.

392
00:20:10,530 --> 00:20:13,160
But I need to win a medal
in Starlight Cup first.

393
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:14,770
You can make it.

394
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,930
We believe in you.

395
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,200
Hope so.

396
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,640
The list is about to be announced.

397
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:21,840
Hope I can get a chance.

398
00:20:22,470 --> 00:20:23,520
Don't worry about it.

399
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,640
Ms. Han is satisfied with
your recent performance.

400
00:20:26,510 --> 00:20:27,370
Of course.

401
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:34,770
Here's the participant list
for Starlight Cup.

402
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,860
(2015 Starlight Cup
Male Participant List)

403
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,560
The male participants are

404
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:41,810
Huang Han,

405
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,160
Nie Chi,

406
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:44,640
Liu Yang,

407
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,370
and Fang Chao.

408
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,290
You're in.

409
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:49,730
The female participants are

410
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,480
Zhou Yao,

411
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:52,570
Tian Yu,

412
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,680
and Lin Ge.

413
00:20:54,450 --> 00:20:55,290
I'm in!

414
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,010
You know how important it is.

415
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,450
You only have one month.

416
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,010
Do your best.

417
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,880
Don't make mistakes in the competition,

418
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,290
especially you, Lin Ge.

419
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:09,810
It's your first competition.
Be prepared.

420
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,050
Yes, coach.

421
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,080
Okay, dismiss.

422
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:19,270
Why isn't Zhu on the list?

423
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:24,290
Slow down!

424
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:25,370
I need to make a call.

425
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,800
Master?

426
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,330
Wait a minute.

427
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:32,250
Hello, Dad.

428
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,290
What's wrong?

429
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,210
I'm going to the Starlight Cup!

430
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:37,010
Oh my god. You scared me.

431
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,600
I thought something went wrong. Good!

432
00:21:39,530 --> 00:21:41,290
Hold on to the wall. Don't fall.

433
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:42,290
Watch your language!

434
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,250
Master, me too.

435
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,770
Master, I'm in!

436
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,360
That's amazing.

437
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,160
Well, Master,

438
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,290
we didn't let you down, right?

439
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,120
Of course not.

440
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:54,970
You're my favorite

441
00:21:54,970 --> 00:21:55,970
students.

442
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,450
Listen...

443
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:00,290
You guys did so well,

444
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:01,210
and I just...

445
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,840
It's too pretentious, right?

446
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,360
You're so pretentious.

447
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,360
Let's get back to the point.

448
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,930
You have to do your best.

449
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,880
This year's Starlight Cup is different.

450
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,250
If you can get good results,

451
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,560
you'll be very likely to get into
the national team.

452
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,120
- National team.
- How can you say that?

453
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,930
We're going to the competition.

454
00:22:22,930 --> 00:22:24,160
Of course we'll do our best.

455
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,050
You're talking too much.

456
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:28,400
I don't worry about Lin Ge and Nie Chi,

457
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,400
but I'm worried about you, okay?

458
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,160
Listen, do your best.

459
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,050
If you can't make it,
I'll break your legs.

460
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,000
Break your legs.

461
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,800
Hello.

462
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,480
I hung up.

463
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,080
Didn't you hear it?

464
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,160
He told you to learn from me.

465
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:45,490
Let's play!

466
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:56,770
Coach.

467
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,010
Why am I not on the list?

468
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,530
I've been back to training for a while.

469
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,160
You got injured,

470
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,600
and you haven't changed
your starting posture.

471
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,880
How can you compete?

472
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,400
Coach, I promise

473
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,320
my injury won't affect my results.

474
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,120
You haven't recovered,

475
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,530
and Starlight Cup is a big competition.

476
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:20,360
You know it's a big competition,

477
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,690
and if I can go there,

478
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:23,010
I'll be closer to my goal.

479
00:23:23,210 --> 00:23:25,560
Even if you get into
the national team after this,

480
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:26,920
so what?

481
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,250
Is it your ultimate goal?

482
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,920
But this could be my last chance.

483
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,080
I don't want to give up.

484
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,230
Zhu, it's been hard for me
to deal with you.

485
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:47,880
I know you've been
doing extra training secretly,

486
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,530
but I didn't punish you
like I did to others.

487
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,160
Do you know why?

488
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,210
I know my limits.

489
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,600
Then you wouldn't have
got injured like this.

490
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:00,800
When you joined the team,

491
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:02,490
your goal was not the women's team

492
00:24:02,730 --> 00:24:04,770
but Gao Kai, the fastest male skater.

493
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,770
You're ambitious and stubborn.

494
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,400
If I stop you from training,

495
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,690
you'll go out and find a wild ice rink.

496
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,120
If I force you to rest for a year,

497
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,840
you'll go to another province.

498
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,490
You know me so well.

499
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,800
As a coach, I've seen a lot of people.

500
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:29,290
Coach, do you think

501
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:32,080
I can get into the national team?

502
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,840
I'm already 21 years old.

503
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,600
Am I too old?

504
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:40,770
Have you ever

505
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,140
thought about what you'd be doing

506
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,420
if you were a student?

507
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,250
You'd be in junior year.

508
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,320
Many people are just starting

509
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,530
to decide whether to get
a master's degree or a job.

510
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,120
They're still students.

511
00:24:55,490 --> 00:24:56,690
You think you're old,

512
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:58,290
but you're very young.

513
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,560
Regardless of the athlete's identity,

514
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,770
you still have a long way to go.

515
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,360
Even when you retire,

516
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,930
you'll still have
two-thirds of your life.

517
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,160
I'm not talking to you

518
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,290
as your coach

519
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,360
but as an old athlete.

520
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,600
Zhu, take your time. Be patient.

521
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,050
Life is long. You should look far ahead.

522
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,930
If you get injuries all over your body,

523
00:25:23,150 --> 00:25:24,690
what's the point of
getting into the team?

524
00:25:25,050 --> 00:25:27,240
Even if one day,
you become a world champion

525
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,360
and make a name,

526
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,640
will it be worth the pain?

527
00:25:31,730 --> 00:25:34,250
Coach, you know

528
00:25:34,250 --> 00:25:35,560
I'm hopeless,

529
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:37,600
so you want me to give up, right?

530
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:38,530
Nothing else matters,

531
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,800
as long as I love skating, right?

532
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,490
That's not what I meant.

533
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,290
In that case,

534
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,080
can you please give me another chance?

535
00:25:48,290 --> 00:25:50,640
How about this?

536
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,880
I'll rest well.

537
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,560
I'll fully recover

538
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,120
in a month.

539
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,250
When I'm back,

540
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:00,010
if there's still a chance,

541
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,530
please let me go to the competition.

542
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:07,120
It's not the only chance
to get into the national team.

543
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:10,290
However, given your physical condition,

544
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:11,930
you shouldn't do it.

545
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:14,330
Coach!

546
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,360
Have you made up your mind?

547
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,160
Yes.

548
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,720
Okay.

549
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:43,880
(In the second year on the team,)

550
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,730
(I got the chance to prove myself.)

551
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,730
(At the perfect age,)

552
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:51,050
(I'm ambitious and capable.)

553
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,690
(I've improved myself a lot.)

554
00:26:52,930 --> 00:26:54,640
(When I stand at the starting line,)

555
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,530
(I'm determined to win.)

556
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,490
(However, I haven't noticed)

557
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,800
(the last person who ruled the ice rink)

558
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,050
(is seeing me as a threat.)

559
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:04,640
(She can't give up,)

560
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,210
(neither can I.)

561
00:27:07,930 --> 00:27:09,010
(For that promise,)

562
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,210
(I'll never look back.)

563
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:24,810
Nie Chi.

564
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,930
It's late. Why are you still here?

565
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,970
Senior Sister, why are you here?

566
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,450
Has your knee recovered?

567
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:34,490
My left leg is fine.

568
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:35,330
Don't worry.

569
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,160
Go back to training.

570
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:55,770
Thanks.

571
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:00,770
You're injured. Please stop.

572
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,360
You should rest well.

573
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,050
I'm lying in my bed all day.

574
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,490
I feel like I'm useless.

575
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,000
What do you need?

576
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:14,530
My leg hurts when I take the turn.

577
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:16,960
Right leg, right?

578
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,050
Could it be that your right leg
supported your body for too long?

579
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:25,610
Me?

580
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,210
I found it earlier.

581
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,690
It's a bad habit.

582
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,930
If it's too long,
your gliding speed will decrease,

583
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:36,090
and your foot will get sore.

584
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,400
Oh, I see.

585
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,600
I thought

586
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,010
my gesture was standard.

587
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,490
It is.

588
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Actually, it's not a big deal.

589
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,770
However, your leg is starting to hurt.

590
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,600
So, you need to be careful.

591
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,080
If this continues,

592
00:29:51,930 --> 00:29:53,880
you might get seriously injured like me.

593
00:29:59,140 --> 00:29:59,980
What are you doing?

594
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,560
Thinking about the school training.

595
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:05,290
I think I formed this habit

596
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:06,840
in the sports school.

597
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:08,460
It's normal.

598
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,730
In a sports school,

599
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:13,120
coaches don't pay attention to details.

600
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,080
Besides,

601
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,780
children's bodies
are not fully developed.

602
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:17,920
Thanks, Senior Sister.

603
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:20,160
It's okay. That's my experience.

604
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,400
I'm glad I can help you.

605
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,690
Nie Chi, are you in a hurry to leave?

606
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:26,600
If you have time,

607
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,250
I can help you correct your gesture.

608
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,050
Okay.

609
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,240
Senior Sister,

610
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:08,730
why don't you
wait until you're fully recovered?

611
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,970
You're pushing yourself too hard.

612
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:16,120
When I was little,

613
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,880
a sports school's coach picked me.

614
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,240
He kept telling my parents

615
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,770
I'd made it into the national team.

616
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,450
I did well back then

617
00:31:28,270 --> 00:31:30,290
and won several regional championships,

618
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,320
so they sold many things to support me.

619
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,080
They kept telling me
they supported me unconditionally,

620
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,050
but they also told me many times

621
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:42,800
they saved every penny

622
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,290
for my speed skates.

623
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:47,530
I suddenly realized

624
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:51,450
parents' love can be so stressful.

625
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:55,250
Then I joined the provincial team.

626
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:57,360
I was so ambitious

627
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,460
that I wanted to win gold medals

628
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:03,380
and get into the national team.

629
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:06,460
However, I injured my knee
during the competition.

630
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,380
After that, I was always

631
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,460
one step away from success.

632
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,860
The national team

633
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,760
never picked me.

634
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,980
This could be my last chance.

635
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,060
So, I want to try my best.

636
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,380
I understand.

637
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,260
I'm happy and doing what I like,

638
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:40,980
but it comes with many prices.

639
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:44,180
Parents' love is important,

640
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,980
but I think you should live for yourself

641
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,860
and fight for what you love.

642
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,460
If you can think like that,

643
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,660
it might be easier for you.

644
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,540
Thank you.

645
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,340
For what?

646
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,620
Because...

647
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:06,860
you don't criticize me

648
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,410
like others do.

649
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:15,460
I heard you were isolated,

650
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,860
but it turns out

651
00:33:16,980 --> 00:33:18,500
you're quite optimistic.

652
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:22,300
I hope we can both get into

653
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:23,150
the national team.

654
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,460
Of course I want it.

655
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:38,260
Every athlete wants
to serve the national team.

656
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:48,620
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

657
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:51,220
Should we talk to our son first?

658
00:33:51,450 --> 00:33:52,360
What's the point?

659
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,020
He never answers our calls.

660
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:55,700
He doesn't want to talk.

661
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:56,780
We're going to

662
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:57,940
talk to his coach

663
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,220
and take him away.

664
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,620
Several schools abroad
have accepted him.

665
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:02,700
We can't wait.

666
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,860
Will this work?

667
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,140
I know him well.

668
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:07,620
If he can't figure it out,

669
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,980
he won't accept it.

670
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,750
I've given him enough time.

671
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,080
If this continues,

672
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:14,580
we'll never reach our goals.

673
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,580
- Over there.
- Nie.

674
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,380
Isn't that your parents?

675
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,780
Ms. Han, they're Nie Chi's parents.

676
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,740
Hello,

677
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,780
I'm Han Bing, Nie Chi's coach.

678
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:34,860
Hello, Ms. Han.

679
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,700
Hello.

680
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,860
- Hello.
- Hello.

681
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,060
It's your first time here, right?

682
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,020
Nie Chi can take half a day off

683
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,860
and show you around.

684
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,100
Ms. Han, right?

685
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,500
Here's the thing.

686
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:48,060
We came here

687
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,380
to talk to you

688
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,960
about leaving the team.

689
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,490
Leaving the team?

690
00:34:57,140 --> 00:34:58,100
Well,

691
00:34:58,300 --> 00:34:59,300
we're in

692
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,820
a complicated situation,

693
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,380
and we need your opinion.

694
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,060
Don't beat about the bush.
Just tell her.

695
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,140
I know what to say.

696
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,980
You...

697
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,260
Why don't we go to my office?

698
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,340
- Okay.
- This way.

699
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,460
Keep an eye on them.

700
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:19,020
Nie, your parents are here.
Why did you run?

701
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,980
I don't want to see them.

702
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,340
Actually, we had a deal with Nie Chi.

703
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:36,280
He can stay in the team for a year.

704
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,580
If he performs well
in a national competition,

705
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:39,940
he'll study abroad.

706
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:42,860
The acceptance letters have arrived,

707
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:44,080
but he doesn't want to go.

708
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,140
He's been avoiding us.

709
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:46,710
Ms. Han, look,

710
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:49,110
many students want
to get into a top university.

711
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,990
He can't miss the chance.

712
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,420
So, we just want to know

713
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,700
what is wrong with him.

714
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,300
You don't want him to be a real athlete?

715
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:01,980
He's won

716
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,500
a national championship.

717
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,340
He's very likely
to get into the national team.

718
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,940
It's so close.

719
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,260
However, being an athlete

720
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,260
is not a good option

721
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,930
for him.

722
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,580
It's not necessarily true.

723
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,820
If he gets good results,

724
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,100
he'll have a good career

725
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,300
and a promising future.

726
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,940
See?

727
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,740
It's just an assumption.

728
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,460
Athletes rely on

729
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,900
their youth and health.

730
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,500
As parents,

731
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,030
we need to think about his future.

732
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,100
Nie,

733
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:58,260
I don't know what to say.

734
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,100
Look what you're doing.

735
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,340
You're acting like a child.

736
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,580
How long can you hide from them?

737
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:08,100
After my 18th birthday.

738
00:37:08,950 --> 00:37:10,640
Well, will you cut ties with them

739
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,180
when you turn 18?

740
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,100
No.

741
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:15,860
But at least

742
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,540
I can be an independent adult.

743
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:20,550
Do you have to do this?

744
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,580
At least they're your parents.

745
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,420
You should talk to them.

746
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,860
Just tell them what you want.

747
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:27,950
Exactly.

748
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,980
You need to communicate. You have to...

749
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:32,020
talk to them, okay?

750
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,980
Stalling for time is more effective
than communicating with them.

751
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:42,860
I'm so close to the national team.

752
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,500
It's right in front of me.

753
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,820
They only care about themselves.

754
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:49,460
They want me to accept
the path they chose for me.

755
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,500
Why should I communicate with them?

756
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,780
If I could persuade them,

757
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:57,940
they wouldn't have set
a one-year deadline.
