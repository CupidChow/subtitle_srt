A participant from the Jiangbei Team
is famous

27
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:39,840
for playing dirty.

28
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
She'd even push her teammates
if necessary.

29
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:44,400
No absolute fair play,

30
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,730
only absolute ability.

31
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:47,760
That's why
short track speed skating is cruel.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,920
You can't change the program
written in your mind,

33
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,760
can you?

34
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,560
It turns out I'm the real coward.

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,090
Everything will be alright.

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,690
Do I

37
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,360
like Lin Ge?

=Episode 10=
=I'll Be with You. Deal!=

39
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,080
Bro, you just need to pass someone.

40
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,330
Is it that hard?

41
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:22,050
Just give it all you've got,
and you'll make it.

42
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:23,240
Why are you so scared?

43
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,800
When Lin Ge tried to
give you a high five,

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,450
you didn't reach out your hand.

45
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,890
Are you a real man?

46
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,240
You're very talented, okay?

47
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,480
Do you really want to go back
to the provincial team?

48
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:38,960
Pass others. That's all.

49
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,680
Come on, let's go to the ice rink.

50
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:42,200
Pass me, okay?

51
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,170
Come on!

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,240
You can't be my training partner.

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,920
Only a few teammates are qualified.

54
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:55,170
I thought it was
just a technical problem

55
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,010
that can be fixed if I try hard.

56
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,680
But it's my mindset.

57
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,290
It's my terrible mindset!

58
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:02,570
I've been a skater for ten years.

59
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,890
I want to stay more than anyone else!

60
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,010
You're yelling.

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
So what?

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,730
Do I have to stay calm?

63
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:34,250
Chao.

64
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,560
I just lost my temper.

65
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,570
It's good.

66
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,760
It's good.

67
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,450
You lost your temper

68
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:01,920
because you treated me like a brother.

69
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:03,570
I mean it.

70
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,080
Nie Chi, when you're with me,

71
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,450
you can yell at me, hit me,

72
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,800
or do anything you want.

73
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,440
I've known you for ten years.

74
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,240
That was the first time

75
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,210
you lost your temper in front of me,

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,730
but I think it's a good thing.

77
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,170
You yelled at me,

78
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,320
but I felt

79
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,480
you treated me like a brother.

80
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:09,240
You just need to pass someone.

81
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,530
Is it that hard?

82
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:12,800
When Lin Ge tried to
give you a high five,

83
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,410
you didn't reach out your hand.

84
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,970
Are you a real man?

85
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:26,730
I thought it was
just a technical problem

86
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,240
that can be fixed if I try hard.

87
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,920
But it's my mindset.

88
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,320
It's my terrible mindset!

89
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:33,970
It turns out I'm the real coward.

90
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,000
You're the smartest person.

91
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,360
Everything will be alright.

92
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,920
I know you'll be fine.

93
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,000
When you like someone,
you miss her all the time

94
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,210
and want to play with her.

95
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,730
I hope she only wants to play with me

96
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,050
instead of someone else.

97
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,410
It's been a few days since we got
the results of the second assessment.

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,480
After careful analysis,
the coaching staff

99
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:11,170
has made a decision.

100
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:12,730
The following candidates

101
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,650
will officially join the national team.

102
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,240
Xie Lingwei,

103
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:20,570
Lin Ge,

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,650
Fang Chao, and Jin Xinxin.

105
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:39,410
There's a pending member, Nie Chi.

106
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,010
Great.

107
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:47,960
Dismiss.

108
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,480
We got in.

109
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,320
Great.

110
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,970
High five.

111
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,450
Li.

112
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,210
After days of consideration,

113
00:06:57,530 --> 00:06:59,000
you still decided to let him stay.

114
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,650
He's got great skills.

115
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,800
If he can get through this,
he'll be the next Gao Kai.

116
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:08,560
We should think about
how to give him a push.

117
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,440
I've told him everything,

118
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,920
but I can't help him with his mindset.

119
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,170
Xie Lingwei is outstanding

120
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,170
not only because she's talented

121
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,650
but because she's simple.

122
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,850
In the ice rink, she can clear her mind

123
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:21,730
and follow the guidance.

124
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,410
She's got great concentration.

125
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:27,320
As for Lin Ge, Fang Chao,
and Jin Xinxin,

126
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,210
they have many thoughts,

127
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,770
but their physical reactions
are faster than minds.

128
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:34,290
However, Nie Chi...

129
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:37,210
Do you mean

130
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:40,050
he thinks too much before taking action?

131
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,170
Yes, that's the problem.

132
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,650
His biggest strength
is his intelligence,

133
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,850
but the problem is he's too smart.

134
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,360
How about training him?

135
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:52,210
Make his body react faster
than his mind does.

136
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,730
It's easy to say.

137
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:55,730
I'll have to make him a superman.

138
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,850
I've never seen anyone like this.

139
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,770
Let's wait and see.

140
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,690
Goodbye.

141
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:17,800
Pending means he's fine.
Why are you so upset?

142
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,090
How can he overcome

143
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,410
the mental disorder?

144
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,240
If he can't get through it,

145
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,530
he'll have to leave
sooner or later, right?

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,840
Well,

147
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
you can't bear to watch him leave?

148
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,170
Jinting!

149
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,650
I knew it.

150
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,770
No wonder

151
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,530
you held him so close the other day.

152
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,170
I... I didn't.

153
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,440
I saw it from the hotel.

154
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,410
Don't worry. I won't tell anyone.

155
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,010
You're wrong about our relationship.

156
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,650
He was telling me

157
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:50,080
why he didn't dare to pass others.

158
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,560
I had never seen him so upset before.

159
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,720
I just wanted to comfort him.

160
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:56,320
Comfort him?

161
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,890
I've never seen you
comfort others like that.

162
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,840
You're always beating Fang Chao.

163
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,530
I think I really...

164
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,800
I don't know.

165
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,770
They're my best friends.

166
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:12,050
I've never seen Fang Chao upset before.

167
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,770
You grew up together.
Don't you have feelings

168
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,410
for each other?

169
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,130
I don't buy it.

170
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,680
You also grew up

171
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,840
with Gao Kai together.

172
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,490
Don't you like each other?

173
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,960
It's completely different.

174
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,090
Look,

175
00:09:35,290 --> 00:09:37,170
I hit Gao Kai, and you beat Fang Chao,

176
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,440
which means we're just friends.

177
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,600
Have you ever hit Nie Chi?

178
00:09:45,770 --> 00:09:47,490
Think about the way he looks at you.

179
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,800
If Gao Kai touches my head,

180
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,250
I'll twist his head off.

181
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,290
Jinting, stop making fun of me.

182
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,490
You're the person I trust the most

183
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:57,560
in the team.

184
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,800
You have to give me an idea today.

185
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,200
Idea?

186
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,440
I'm not sure about it,

187
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,800
but judging from his personality,

188
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,370
I think he should choose long track.

189
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,680
Long track?

190
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,760
I got it.

191
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,880
You got what?

192
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,410
Thanks, Jinting.

193
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:18,040
For what?

194
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:20,290
I know how to help him.

195
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:32,560
What's this for?

196
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,010
When I was talking to Jinting,

197
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,770
I realized something important.

198
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,440
What is it?

199
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,320
What's the difference between

200
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,840
speed skating
and short track speed skating?

201
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:45,680
The skates, rinks, and rules.

202
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,010
Do you remember

203
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,530
Gao Kai was once disqualified

204
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,770
due to a collision?

205
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,200
I saw a comment that says

206
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:56,250
short track speed skating
should change the rules

207
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,600
to avoid collisions.

208
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,530
Then someone commented,

209
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,490
"Why don't you watch speed skating?"

210
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:02,840
I was like,

211
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,680
"That's right."

212
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:05,440
Nie Chi,

213
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,440
if you're really scared of
physical collision

214
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,650
and want to win the competition
with absolute speed,

215
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,890
why didn't you choose long track?

216
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,210
You're right.

217
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,170
You got me wrong.

218
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,170
I'm not asking you to change the event.

219
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,170
I only like short track.

220
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,440
I won't change it.

221
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,290
Now that you've chosen short track,

222
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:28,800
you can't be scared of collision.

223
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,960
You have to pass others.

224
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,650
I'll figure it out.

225
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,010
That's right. I'll be with you.

226
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,640
Deal.

227
00:11:50,770 --> 00:11:51,650
As we know,

228
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,320
the World Tour is coming.

229
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,770
The participants need to
go to Shanghai for training.

230
00:11:58,130 --> 00:12:00,720
We only have one
female short-distance participant.

231
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:03,170
She's Xie Lingwei.

232
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:05,730
Lin Ge,

233
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,320
you did well in imitating

234
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,530
Yang Xiaofei.

235
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,010
You'll be her training partner

236
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,370
until she leaves.

237
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,320
You have to work hard.

238
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,370
Don't slack off.

239
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:39,410
Let's stay in touch.

240
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,170
- Text me.
- Senior Sister, Shan.

241
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,010
Where are you going?

242
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,040
Lin Ge,

243
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,200
actually, I forgot to tell you

244
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:47,800
I'm going to retire.

245
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,410
I'll be doing the paperwork
in the next few days.

246
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:52,050
I don't have competitions.

247
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,600
I should've gone back.

248
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,010
I stayed a few more days

249
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,050
to take care of Wei.

250
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,410
It's so sudden.

251
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,530
Senior Sister, Lin Ge,

252
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,600
I have to go.

253
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,650
I have to catch a plane.

254
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,050
- What?
- Go.

255
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,680
I'll leave Wei to you.

256
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,800
Please take care of her.

257
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,560
Don't worry.

258
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,320
We will meet again.

259
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,680
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

260
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,810
Bye.

261
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,370
Senior Sister...

262
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,370
Lin Ge,

263
00:13:26,370 --> 00:13:29,490
why are you acting like
you'll never see me again.

264
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,490
Do you have to retire?

265
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,680
I made up my mind a long time ago.

266
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:39,650
I wanted to take one last shot

267
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:40,920
in the World Tour.

268
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,890
But I'm not on the list,

269
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,600
so I have to let it go.

270
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:49,200
But I think you're...

271
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,250
Not upset?

272
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,370
No.

273
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,560
I think you're so close to success.

274
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:56,250
If you try,

275
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,890
you'll get your chance.

276
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,600
I'm close to the World Tour

277
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,410
but not close to the Winter Olympics.

278
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,440
I'm already 27 years old.

279
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:08,050
I know my physical condition.

280
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,720
I don't think I should

281
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,800
waste the national team's resources.

282
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,410
There are many people

283
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:16,650
who need them more than I do.

284
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,270
Senior Sister...

285
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:23,370
Smile.

286
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,250
I can't.

287
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,900
Lin Ge,

288
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,250
since the first time
I saw your training,

289
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,130
I've believed

290
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,410
that you'll be successful.

291
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:35,890
You can do it.

292
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,370
Senior Sister...

293
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,530
(National Ice Sports Base)
Call me.

294
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:51,920
Okay, I got it.

295
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,200
Take care of yourself.

296
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:55,290
- Call me. Goodbye.
- Bye.

297
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
- Bye.
- Wei, what's wrong?

298
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,440
I have a gift for you.

299
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,490
My grandma made this colorful rope.

300
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:04,960
It can protect you.

301
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:06,250
You can wear it

302
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,200
in competitions

303
00:15:08,370 --> 00:15:10,320
so that you won't get injured.

304
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,960
I only have two ropes.

305
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:13,770
I didn't give it to Senior Sister.

306
00:15:13,890 --> 00:15:14,800
It's yours.

307
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:17,650
Thanks, Wei.

308
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,040
Do your best.

309
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,770
Wei, let's go.

310
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,130
By the way,

311
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,050
prepare for the domestic competitions.

312
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:28,890
It's the perfect time
to improve yourself.

313
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,920
Ask Ms. Han to correct the details.

314
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,290
Don't worry, Jinting.

315
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,440
Okay. Just go back.

316
00:15:35,290 --> 00:15:36,130
Take care of Wei.

317
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,210
I got it.

318
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,160
Go.

319
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,320
Sir, close the door.

320
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:40,560
Bye.

321
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,610
Bye.

322
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,060
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

323
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,410
Coach, we're back!

324
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,920
Why are you so heavy?

325
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:02,370
Did you get fat?

326
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:05,200
I've tried hard to lose weight.

327
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,030
Aerobic training tomorrow.

328
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:11,560
Coach, I just came back.

329
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,490
You're not a child. Don't play cute.

330
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,170
Look at Nie Chi and Fang Chao.

331
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:16,200
They're standing straight.

332
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,010
What about your rooms?

333
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,800
I'll sleep in my old room.

334
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,320
Okay. It's good.

335
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,800
Check the program.

336
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:31,440
You know some of them.

337
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:32,850
Come on.

338
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:37,490
Zhu Zhu, 1000m.

339
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,710
Jinting told me

340
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,530
it's harder to get into
the national team

341
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,720
because we've got Wei.

342
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,440
Did she make a compromise?

343
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,250
The Jiangnan Team and the event

344
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,080
are the compromises she made.

345
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,010
She'll eventually
join the national team.

346
00:16:53,770 --> 00:16:54,610
Don't be scared.

347
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,370
You can race with her.

348
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,370
Okay. It's getting late.

349
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,520
You just got here.

350
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,010
Organize your stuff.

351
00:17:03,010 --> 00:17:03,850
Rest early.

352
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,850
Yes, coach.

353
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,120
Then we're leaving.

354
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,080
Goodbye, coach.

355
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:11,610
Goodbye, coach.

356
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:20,360
Hello, I'm Ni Zitong.

357
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:23,290
Hello, I'm Lin Ge.

358
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:25,000
Senior Sister, what are you doing?

359
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,600
You were like this
when you joined the team.

360
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,080
Did you lie to the little girl?

361
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:32,920
I didn't.

362
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:33,930
Tong asked me

363
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,080
what you were like back then.

364
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,160
I said you even

365
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,490
kowtowed to me when we first met.

366
00:17:38,050 --> 00:17:40,450
I... I was cleaning the room.

367
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,880
Senior Sister, did everyone
who slept here before

368
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:45,360
join the national team?

369
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,750
That's true.

370
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,490
The senior sister who slept here before

371
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:50,160
is participating in the World Tour.

372
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:53,120
Oh, I think it has begun.

373
00:17:53,930 --> 00:17:55,010
Luckily, I have quick news.

374
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,240
Check it out.

375
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,020
(Xie Lingwei won the 500m gold medal!)

376
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,490
Incredible!

377
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,930
Xie Lingwei is just
a little older than me.

378
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,770
How can she skate so fast?

379
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:07,450
Right now,

380
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,800
your muscles are still developing.

381
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:09,850
Your speed

382
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,930
will be greatly improved in two years.

383
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:12,770
Really?

384
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:13,910
Good luck.

385
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,490
Where are you going?

386
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:17,850
Ice rink.

387
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,020
You'll miss

388
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:19,880
the competitions.

389
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:21,500
There's a replay. Bye.

390
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:26,490
I can't believe it.

391
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:29,530
She's so hard-working.

392
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,640
She's already on the national team.

393
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:32,730
Why can't she take a break?

394
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,120
Something's wrong with the bed.

395
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,770
It makes people anxious.

396
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:54,250
Did you watch the competition?

397
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,680
Just one race.

398
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,290
There are men's competitions.

399
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:58,970
Didn't you say you want to study them?

400
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,490
There's a replay.

401
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,880
I can watch it anytime.

402
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,720
Your equipment?

403
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,320
I didn't come out for training.

404
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,640
I watched Xie Lingwei's race

405
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:09,600
and knew you'd go to the ice rink.

406
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:15,320
When I read the quick news,

407
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,400
I felt I had to leave the dorm.

408
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,530
My teammate just won the gold medal

409
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:20,970
in the World Tour.

410
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,730
She went to Shanghai for training.

411
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,250
The new junior sister in the dorm

412
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,800
will replace me sooner or later.

413
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,640
I couldn't stay in the dorm.

414
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,770
It occurred to me

415
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,450
Zhu Zhu did extra training every day.

416
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,600
Maybe that was because

417
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,210
she didn't want to see me.

418
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,840
To be honest, I'm very tired.

419
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,160
I should rest.

420
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:50,290
Forget about the training.

421
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,690
Let's hang out.

422
00:19:53,450 --> 00:19:54,320
Enough about me.

423
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,800
Why are you here?

424
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,880
Just like you.

425
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,480
I was supposed to
watch men's competitions,

426
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,430
but I couldn't stay in the dorm.

427
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:06,640
Haven't you figured out

428
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,320
how to overcome the mental disorder?

429
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,120
I have to put it into action.

430
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:12,530
What about the Grand Prix?

431
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,050
I have to find out
after the competitions.

432
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:19,880
I miss the days in the provincial team.

433
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,160
I made progress with Ms. Han's guidance.

434
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:26,160
I could skate faster than before
every month.

435
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:27,640
I had goals,

436
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,400
and they were within reach.

437
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,560
But now you're also making progress.

438
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,970
Walking at the foot of the mountain
is different from

439
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,240
climbing the mountain.

440
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,640
Climbing the mountain

441
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,560
is so tiring.

442
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:55,880
As you can see,

443
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,250
the preliminaries of the Grand Prix
have officially begun.

444
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:00,210
Right now, the first place
of this competition

445
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:01,880
is Sun Siwen from Jiangbei Team.

446
00:21:02,050 --> 00:21:04,770
- She's famous for her explosive power.
- Come on!

447
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,010
Who will cross the line first?

448
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,320
It's Sun Siwen from Jiangbei Team!

449
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,880
Congratulations.

450
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,640
I'll talk to her.

451
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:24,450
Did you change your event to 1000m

452
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,840
to get into the national team?

453
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:27,130
Yes.

454
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,290
I heard the dark horse
at the World Championships

455
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,450
is your roommate.

456
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,210
How does it feel
to spend time with a genius?

457
00:21:36,690 --> 00:21:37,770
We're very close.

458
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,770
The closer you are,

459
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:41,870
the greater the gap between you is.

460
00:21:42,490 --> 00:21:44,360
The moment you start to dislike her

461
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:46,770
is when you have to catch up with her.

462
00:21:53,010 --> 00:21:54,320
Cheers.

463
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,850
Nie Chi,

464
00:21:55,850 --> 00:21:57,210
you have to eat more.

465
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,730
You haven't eaten anything.

466
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,640
Do you dislike the barbecue

467
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,320
or my restaurant?

468
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
Maybe he doesn't like
your leather jacket.

469
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,400
Look at the collar.

470
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,250
This is the symbol...

471
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:09,090
He's a boss now.

472
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:10,640
...of a mature man.

473
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:14,080
I saw Zhu Zhu on the official website

474
00:22:14,490 --> 00:22:15,690
of the Grand Prix.

475
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,880
She's doing 1000m now.

476
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:19,970
How has she been?

477
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:20,970
Have you talked to her?

478
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,490
She treated her knee

479
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:26,400
during the break.

480
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,050
She did well in singles

481
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,800
and the relay,

482
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:31,730
but her teammates were too slow

483
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:32,970
to win a medal.

484
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:34,840
That wasn't her fault.

485
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,530
She finally treated her knee.

486
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,770
That's great.

487
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,290
She finally listened to me.

488
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:43,360
She's quite happy now, isn't she?

489
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:45,610
She is.

490
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,290
Listen, Lin Ge,

491
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,490
Zhu Zhu's personality...

492
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,730
She's so stubborn.

493
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,880
Bro, you became so talkative

494
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,290
after drinking.

495
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,800
You didn't drink at all.

496
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,290
Don't judge me.

497
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,930
- This is a special time.
- What did you drink?

498
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,930
I can't drink now.

499
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:00,800
(Jinghua Barbecue)
Here.

500
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:16,050
Lin Ge,

501
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:18,530
I have enough

502
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,120
food and drinks,

503
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:23,560
but don't eat too much.

504
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,840
You're still in training.
You have competitions.

505
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:27,400
Didn't you say you were on a diet?

506
00:23:27,930 --> 00:23:29,250
I don't want to waste the food.

507
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,930
Anyway, I can run for a bit longer.

508
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,690
Han, don't drink too much.

509
00:23:32,970 --> 00:23:34,600
You just retired.

510
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:36,360
Don't worry.

511
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,600
Listen, I have a long life

512
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:42,640
ahead of me after retirement.

513
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,640
After retirement,

514
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,970
I realized something.

515
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,360
A person's life

516
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,930
is not just about the first few years.

517
00:23:55,730 --> 00:23:58,770
Short track speed skating
is just a short period of my life.

518
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,640
I have tens of years to live,

519
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,320
and that's what matters,

520
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,160
understand?

521
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,640
Do you regret being an athlete?

522
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:14,810
No.

523
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,530
Why would I regret it?

524
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:19,530
That was also part of my life.

525
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,320
I can't regret it.

526
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,200
No.

527
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,690
You got me wrong.

528
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,160
Listen,

529
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,690
not everyone can become a champion.

530
00:24:34,850 --> 00:24:35,690
Yes.

531
00:24:35,690 --> 00:24:37,210
What about the people who can't?

532
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,280
Should they

533
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:40,290
lose hope and wait to die?

534
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:43,160
Here's an example.

535
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,360
You know Nie Chi's

536
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,880
family background.

537
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,290
He's from a rich family.

538
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,210
No matter what results he gets,

539
00:24:51,210 --> 00:24:52,840
someone will always have his back.

540
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,490
If he becomes a world champion,

541
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,050
he'll live a wealthy life.

542
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,880
Even if he retires now,

543
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,560
he'll still live a wealthy life.

544
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,770
Han, stop drinking.

545
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,360
Well, let's talk about you.

546
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,140
I remember when we just met,

547
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,450
you were so obsessed

548
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:14,050
with the allowance and prizes.

549
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:15,490
Your life

550
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,080
was very frugal.

551
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,450
What about now?

552
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,360
I still want to make money,

553
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,840
but I have more important

554
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:28,320
things to do.

555
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,320
So does Nie Chi.

556
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,800
He wants to make a name for himself.

557
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,320
Everyone wants to realize their dreams

558
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,050
on their own.

559
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,530
Dreams, it's always about dreams.

560
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,560
Han, stop.

561
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:47,290
Everyone had dreams.

562
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,360
I'll...

563
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,160
go to the bathroom.

564
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,090
Han.

565
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,440
What's wrong?

566
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,970
He's drunk.

567
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,320
Drunk?

568
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,010
What were you talking about?

569
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,560
Money and dream.

570
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:45,730
I have a question.

571
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:47,290
What is your dream?

572
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,400
Sugar-coated haws.

573
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,370
Eat it.

574
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:15,770
(Many years later,)

575
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,690
(Fang Chao told me)

576
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:18,800
(how he tried to steal me)

577
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,560
(from Nie Chi for the first time.)

578
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:22,880
(He bravely took the first step,)

579
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:24,930
(but it was so awkward)

580
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,120
(that he didn't even)

581
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:29,050
(cause any stir.)

582
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,400
(However, he sees the small step)

583
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:34,600
(as a great leap forward.)

584
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,290
(From that moment,)

585
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:38,290
(he began to distance himself
from Nie Chi.)

586
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:40,120
(As for the results...)

587
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,360
The sugar-coated haws

588
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,600
were so good.

589
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,210
I'll buy some weird stuff

590
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,690
next time

591
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,400
such as sugar-coated spicy snacks

592
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,530
and sugar-coated chicken feet.

593
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:55,050
Well, Nie Chi,

594
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:56,770
take these back to my room.

595
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,250
I need a moment with Lin Ge.

596
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:01,210
What do you want to tell me alone?

597
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:03,400
My mom asked me to tell you, okay?

598
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,840
Fine, I'll leave you alone.

599
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,640
Did you buy a phone for my mom?

600
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,160
Mrs. Fang said her phone

601
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,360
couldn't take good pictures,

602
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,770
so I bought one with a good camera.

603
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,800
My mom bought a phone for you,

604
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:29,970
and you bought one for her.

605
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,690
What's this about?

606
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:32,600
Returning the favor?

607
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:34,490
Do you have a problem?

608
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:36,160
Only strangers

609
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,120
care about manners.

610
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,690
Families don't care about that.

611
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,640
My mom bought a lot of things for me

612
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:42,600
when I was young.

613
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,450
When did I give her something in return?

614
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,400
Why are you so proud of

615
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,530
not buying things for her?

616
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:50,560
I'm trying to tell you

617
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,560
not to buy her stuff

618
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,530
every time she mentions something.

619
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:56,050
Now she doesn't dare

620
00:28:56,050 --> 00:28:57,210
to ask you anything,

621
00:28:57,210 --> 00:28:58,490
and she turns to me.

622
00:28:58,530 --> 00:28:59,840
What should I say?

623
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:00,730
I know nothing,

624
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:01,730
and I have to ask you.

625
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,160
That's a vicious cycle.

626
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:06,640
What a good son you are.

627
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,640
Did she like the phone?

628
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,730
Did it work well?

629
00:29:11,010 --> 00:29:11,970
She did.

630
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:13,770
She liked it so much.

631
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:15,640
She wouldn't leave it.

632
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,970
She was so happy.

633
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,080
But she asked me to tell you

634
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,690
not to spend money on her.

635
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,250
She mentioned it on WeChat.

636
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,690
She told me to talk to you in person.

637
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,730
She emphasized it

638
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,290
a million times,

639
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,290
understand?

640
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,690
There's something else!

641
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,400
Have you had enough?

642
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,770
Let's hang out on the day off.

643
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,250
Just you and me.

644
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:42,480
Why not?

645
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,400
Are you preparing a gift

646
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,600
for Nie Chi's birthday?

647
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:49,210
It's too soon to prepare.

648
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,050
It's not about him.

649
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,730
Why are you always talking about him?
Just the two of us.

650
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,840
Okay.

651
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,930
It's a deal.

652
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,730
No problem.

653
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,250
Lin Ge, listen,

654
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,400
this is an announcement

655
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,840
instead of a negotiation.

656
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,880
Don't tell anyone.

657
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,400
Understand?

658
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,290
Is this a prank?

659
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,730
Just hanging out.

660
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,320
Do you ask these questions

661
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,730
when Nie Chi asks you out?

662
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,120
Fine. I'll go.

663
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,010
I won't tell anyone.

664
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,080
You promise.

665
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,690
What are you doing?

666
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,970
I've never seen you
tidy up your clothes.

667
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm looking for some clothes.

668
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,120
Why are they all ugly?

669
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,290
What is this?

670
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,840
Wait, leather jacket...

671
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:06,770
Did you learn that from Han?

672
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:10,400
Does it look good?

673
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:11,970
No bad.

674
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,360
What are you looking for? It's a mess.

675
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,120
Nothing. Just tidying up.

676
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,400
Nie Chi is back.

677
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:23,640
You can wear his clothes.

678
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,080
My clothes are in the wardrobe.

679
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,180
Just suit yourself.

680
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,320
No need.

681
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:32,530
I'm just tidying up.

682
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,050
I'm leaving.

683
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,770
He really tidied up the room.

684
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,010
Aren't you going with him?

685
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,880
He didn't tell me about it.

686
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:56,880
That's so weird.

687
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:19,660
(Lin Ge)

688
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,860
(Lin Ge)

689
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,770
- I'm not going!
- Hurry up.

690
00:32:37,770 --> 00:32:38,610
No!

691
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,050
It's just a mall.

692
00:32:40,050 --> 00:32:41,450
It's so boring.

693
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,080
Do you want to buy something?

694
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,490
Women's Day is coming up.

695
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:46,770
Didn't we agree

696
00:32:46,770 --> 00:32:48,360
not to buy stuff for my mom?

697
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:49,560
Don't waste money.

698
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,600
You conveyed the message,

699
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,640
but I didn't say I'd listen.

700
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:53,880
Besides, it's an important date.

701
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,010
Shouldn't we do something?

702
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,360
We should.

703
00:32:57,530 --> 00:32:58,370
Well,

704
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,880
I forgot to tell you something.

705
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,770
Last year,

706
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:04,490
my mom's colleague

707
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:06,490
received a gift from her cunning son.

708
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,360
He sent it

709
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,730
to her office.

710
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:10,360
- To her office?
- Listen, not just that.

711
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:11,600
When she went to the office,

712
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,840
she started to show it off

713
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,640
to everyone she met.

714
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:17,010
My mom was pissed off.

715
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,690
Then I thought about it.

716
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:21,250
Maybe I should also buy a gift this year

717
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:22,670
and send it to her office

718
00:33:22,690 --> 00:33:23,530
so that she can

719
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:25,320
show it off as she wants.

720
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,400
When she enters the room,

721
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,880
it'll be like,

722
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,560
"Zhen, you're here.

723
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,010
Zhen, you look different.

724
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,800
Did your son buy this for you?"

725
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:34,640
Enough.

726
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,160
That's exactly what I want.

727
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:38,210
In terms of the competition
among mothers,

728
00:33:38,210 --> 00:33:40,560
I won't allow my mother to lose.

729
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,490
Yes, she can't lose.

730
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,360
- Follow me, little brother!
- I'm older.

731
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,600
But when it comes to social status,

732
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,200
you're my big sister.

733
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,320
Sister Ge, please.

734
00:33:54,810 --> 00:33:55,800
Follow me.

735
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:57,540
Wait for me.

736
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,890
Why don't you talk to me?

737
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,200
About what?

738
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:15,530
Anything.

739
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:17,890
When the three of us hung out,

740
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,890
you were always talking.

741
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,760
Because he'd argue with me.

742
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:22,450
Anyone can argue.

743
00:34:22,490 --> 00:34:23,330
I can argue too.

744
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:25,530
Can you learn something good from him?

745
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:26,370
Not this.

746
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:28,330
What should I learn?

747
00:34:28,490 --> 00:34:29,640
Is Nie Chi better than me?

748
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:32,680
You're pretty much the same.

749
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:36,120
How about this one?

750
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,640
I don't think she has a camel coat.

751
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:39,760
She only has

752
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,160
some cotton-padded jackets.

753
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:44,970
Why is Nie Chi better than me?

754
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,330
I saw a similar one

755
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:51,280
in another store,

756
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:52,930
but it's 500 yuan cheaper.

757
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,450
It has cashmere lining. It's soft.

758
00:34:57,450 --> 00:34:58,370
Why is he better?

759
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,760
What's wrong with you?

760
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,010
Can you stop talking about him?

761
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:03,530
Why don't you ask him over?

762
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,370
You're crazy.

763
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:06,280
Miss, I'll take this one.

764
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,600
- Wait...
- Large size.

765
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,680
This is the expensive one.

766
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,890
I'd love to buy expensive clothes
for Mrs. Fang.

767
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:17,080
None of your business.

768
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,410
You bought a lot of things.

769
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:25,760
Do you see her as your mother?

770
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:27,640
Apart from my mother,

771
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:30,200
you're the closest people to me.

772
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:32,490
Besides, we're not actually related,

773
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:33,640
but you've been good to me.

774
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,280
I'm grateful for that.

775
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,330
This might sound pretentious,

776
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:39,120
but I really appreciate your help.

777
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:42,280
You don't have to say this.

778
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,370
I mean it.

779
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:45,200
Go ahead.

780
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:47,120
Listen,

781
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:48,810
buying things for your parents

782
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:50,760
is not about returning the favor.

783
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:53,560
I just want to do something for them

784
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,010
and make them happy.

785
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,200
When I had no money,

786
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:00,810
I tried so hard to make money

787
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,450
because I didn't want to seek help
from others.

788
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,850
Now that

789
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:06,490
I've joined the national team

790
00:36:06,970 --> 00:36:08,200
and have enough money,

791
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,200
I just want to treat your parents well.

792
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,490
Because of your family,

793
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:18,280
I can finally have a home.

794
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,680
What about me?

795
00:36:26,450 --> 00:36:27,530
What do you think of me?

796
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,640
You're also a member of your family.

797
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,370
What do I think of you?

798
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,280
Let's talk about it.

799
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,370
We went to the sports school

800
00:36:35,970 --> 00:36:36,810
and trained together,

801
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:38,490
and you got my back.

802
00:36:39,450 --> 00:36:41,680
I'll always keep that in mind.

803
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,240
You're getting

804
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,720
dumber and dumber,

805
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,120
but don't worry.

806
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,050
As long as I have food to eat,

807
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,640
I won't let you starve.

808
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,410
Speaking of food, I'm really hungry.

809
00:36:55,010 --> 00:36:57,050
Enough for the talk. Let's eat.

810
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,280
I'm so moved.

811
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,760
Fine, thank you for saying that.

812
00:37:01,970 --> 00:37:03,200
Tell me what you want to eat.

813
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,450
It's on me.

814
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:05,600
Really?

815
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,590
I want to eat hotpot.

816
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,890
Hotpot? It must be a hotpot buffet.

817
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,120
We'd better have a barbecue too.

818
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,370
- Let's go!
