Did you tamper with Lin Ge's ice skates?

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,920
You watched too many movies.

28
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:41,970
Did she fall?

29
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,400
She didn't fall

30
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,920
because I asked her
to change the skates earlier.

31
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,200

even if you give it all you've got,)

(We all need the courage to start over.)

34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,530
I've kept our promise.

35
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:59,760

Sir, how can I get the big bear?

38
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,730
Choose the small one.

39
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,320
Want to play?

40
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,170
Want to try?

41
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,920
Sir, how much?

42
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,080
20 yuan for 12 rings.

43
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:22,130
So expensive.

44
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,680
It's very cheap.

45
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,520
How much is that big bear in the market?

46
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,730
More than 200.

47
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:33,410
It's worth the risk.

48
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,640
Shall we?

49
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,450
Okay.

50
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:38,330
It's on me.

51
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:52,570
A toothpick.

52
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,450
A nail clipper.

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,410
An ear scoop.

54
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:55,320
A hairpin.

55
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,170
A keychain.

56
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,010
A boss.

57
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:02,170
You can't take me away.

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,080
How much?

59
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,200
100 yuan.

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,570
100!

61
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,890
I got it!

62
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:44,610
I got it!

63
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,320
I got it!

64
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,200
Sir!

65
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,360

74
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,410
You're going to Beijing soon.

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,050
It's a big city.

76
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,800
Please take care of Fang Chao.

77
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,120
Why didn't you ask me

78
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,650
to take care of them?

79
00:05:32,770 --> 00:05:33,970
Don't blame me.

80
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,480
You're a silly boy who never

81
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,320
left his hometown.

82
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,320
Lin Ge lived in Jiangnan,

83
00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:39,920
and Nie Chi has been to Beijing.

84
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,050
You've

85
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,050
never left here.

86
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,410
They have to take care of you.

87
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,050
It's your fault.

88
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,210
You've never

89
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:47,530
taken me anywhere.

90
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,880
I never had the chance to leave.

91
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,720
Exactly.

92
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,240
Fine. It's my fault.

93
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:54,170
Master, don't worry.

94
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:55,730
We'll take care of each other.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,170
Well said. Take care of each other.

96
00:05:58,530 --> 00:05:59,370
Come on.

97
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:01,290
For taking care of each other.

98
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:02,970
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,050
Fang.

101
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,650
Do you think Chao

102
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,970
has feelings for Ge?

103
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,250
What feelings?

104
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,730
What else could it be?

105
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,240
What do you mean?

106
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,410
The three of them
are together all the time.

107
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,050
Who will Ge choose,

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,970
Chao or Chi?

109
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,050
Darling, you're a woman.

110
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:46,650
If you were her, who would you choose?

111
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,360
I'd choose the handsome one.

112
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,570
Yes.

113
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,680
I agree.

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,800
You have good taste.

115
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,210
I'm handsome, right?

116
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,120
Stop. Did I say it was you?

117
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,610
Darling,

118
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,000
speaking of which,

119
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,480
I'll be honest with you.

120
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm worried that our son

121
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,290
is not persistent enough.

122
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,680
When I pursued you,

123
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,650
I faced so many difficulties.

124
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:16,680
Fortunately, I got you in the end.

125
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,880
In that case,

126
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,120
Chao

127
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:26,290
really needs your advice.

128
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:28,970
Darling, I don't think

129
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,880
we should worry about them.

130
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,880
Let the young people experience

131
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,650
love, happiness, and sorrow.

132
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:38,680
We just need to wait and see.

133
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:40,250
Okay?

134
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:41,810
Don't worry.

Hello, Senior Brother.

It's okay. Let's go.

146

I knew you'd come,

147
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,320
but it was really fast.

148
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,440
Let me show you around.

149
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,720

152
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,130
Threw it.

153
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,650
Did you forget it?

154
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,770
I helped you

155
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,050
to deal with your parents.

156
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,560
You need to say thanks.

157
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,650
No need.

You're my target for now.

Kid,

169
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,600
it's inappropriate
to challenge the team leader

170
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:11,730
at this point, right?

171
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,440
You asked me, didn't you?

172
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,560
I'm always honest.

173
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:18,650
Occasionally honest.

174
00:09:21,290 --> 00:09:22,130
- Jinting.
- Look.

176
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:25,410
Of course. You'll be there too.

Let's go.

178
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,440
By the way, how's Zhu doing?

179
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,600
I think Zhu

180
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,130
joined Jiangnan Team.

181
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,370
When did that happen?

182
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,560
After the Starlight Cup.

183
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,760
Why?

184
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,920
Maybe she wanted to change a place.

185
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,960
I've never seen someone
as stubborn as her.

186
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,720
But it's not a bad thing.

187
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,650
To be honest,

188
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,530
I wasn't a good friend.

189
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:56,080
After the competition,

190
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,770
she didn't reply to my message,

191
00:09:58,170 --> 00:09:59,130
and I stopped asking.

192
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,370
Jinting, if you

193
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,770
talk to her again,

194
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,840
don't mention me.

195
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:04,800
Why?

196
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,210
I got it.

197
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,800
Cheer up. This is the national team.

198
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,320
Oh, your roommate is famous.

199
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,700
- Let's check it out.
- Okay.

200
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,410
Your rooms are over here,

201
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,890
and ours are over there.

202
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:20,610
Tong Le.

203
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:21,840
Let me introduce her.

204
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:23,130
This is Tong Le.

205
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,730
Hello, Senior Sister.

206
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,590
Hello.

207
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,960
This is Lin Ge. We both
slept on the same bed before.

208
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,800
Work hard.

209
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,140
- See you next time.
- Okay.

210
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,010
We're going in.

211
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,560
Okay. I'm leaving.

212
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,800
- Bye, Senior Sister.
- Bye.

213
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:35,890
This is your room.

214
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:40,680
Hi, hello.

215
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,410
I'm Lin Ge, your roommate.

216
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,440
Hello.

217
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,890
I'm not your roommate.

218
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,920
This is Wei.

219
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:51,720
Hi, hello.

220
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,720
I'm Lin Ge.

221
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,410
Hi.

222
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:56,920
Nie,

223
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:58,890
the dorm is so fancy.

224
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:01,410
It's much bigger than our old dorm.

225
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,730
Well...

226
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:04,250
What?

227
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,440
Organize your stuff.

228
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:07,050
I won't do it for you.

229
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,440
So annoying.

230
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:11,890
Well, I'm so glad I'm here.

231
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,560
Do you know why?

232
00:11:13,770 --> 00:11:15,130
- Why?
- Because

233
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,320
I don't need to share
a bunk bed with you anymore.

234
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,440
I finally have an entire bed.

235
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,280
Whose clothes?

236
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,490
It's yours.

237
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:23,680
Why did you put it in my case?

238
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,920
It was heavy.

239
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,770
Mine was full,

240
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,370
so I put it in your case.

241
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,290
Why are you...?

242
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,960
Wrong room. It's occupied.

243
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:38,490
Isn't this my room?

244
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,680
Put it here.

245
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,530
I think I've seen you before.

246
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,410
Well, I'm Jin Xinxin.

247
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,560
It means plenty of gold.

248
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,290
I met you at the Grand Prix.

249
00:11:52,290 --> 00:11:53,720
Yes, the Grand Prix.

250
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,170
No wonder you look so familiar.

251
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:56,370
- Yes.
- I'm Fang Chao.

252
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,210
Hello.

253
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,370
It's okay.

254
00:12:01,370 --> 00:12:02,210
I'm Nie Chi.

255
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:03,250
Hello.

256
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,680
Jin Xinxin.

257
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,370
What does it mean?

258
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,530
Plenty of gold?

259
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,130
Unbelievable.

260
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:11,800
Seven "Gold" characters in your name.

261
00:12:12,010 --> 00:12:13,800
Is gold that important to you?

262
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,890
No. My sister's name is Mingyue.

263
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,370
They named me Xingxing,

264
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,600
but the register officer

265
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,010
misheard

266
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,170
the original name,

267
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,560
and I ended up with this name.

268
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,960
Wait a minute.

269
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:27,680
What's your original name?

270
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:28,850
Xingxing.

271
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:31,890
It means shining stars in the night sky.

272
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,770
Bro, where are you from?

273
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:36,680
Zhejiang province. What's wrong?

274
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,720
Oh, god.

275
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,050
You're from Zhejiang.

276
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,680
Now I know what happened.

277
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,960
He didn't overhear it.

278
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,800
Your pronunciation was incorrect.

279
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:46,490
"Xing" and "Xin" are different.

280
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,010
You confused them.

281
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,530
I confused them?

282
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:52,130
Isn't my name Jin Xinxin?

283
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,600
Should it be Jin Xingxing?

284
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,320
Enough.

285
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,830
I can't take it anymore.

286
00:12:58,070 --> 00:12:59,010
Oh, my god.

287
00:12:59,010 --> 00:12:59,850
How about this?

288
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,290
I'll call you Seven Gold.

289
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,320
No problem.

290
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,770
My teammates called me Eight Gold.

291
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:05,560
I need to find my room.

292
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:06,400
Okay.

293
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:07,720
You guys go on.

294
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,280
Can you handle it?

295
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,330
Yes.

296
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,770
Be careful.

297
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

298
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:21,200
Nie, he's so funny.

299
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,800
He looks like a gorilla.

300
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:25,320
Enough. Organize your stuff.

301
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:28,530
Wait a minute.

302
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,250
Your clothes are in my case.

303
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:31,920
Where are my clothes?

304
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,560
Are they in your case?

305
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,680
- Stop.
- You hid them.

306
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,530
Don't touch my stuff.

307
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,490
Fang Chao!

308
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
Look at this.

309
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:44,910
Why didn't I notice it?

310
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,130
Can I hang your pictures here?

311
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,060
Okay. It's good.

312
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:55,920
Gao Kai.

313
00:13:57,050 --> 00:13:58,050
Your place is so tidy.

314
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,680
Shan cleaned it up.

315
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:00,890
Attention,

316
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,440
physical test tomorrow morning.

317
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:03,920
Eat breakfast.

318
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,250
If you can't pass it,
you'll have no scores.

319
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,040
Okay!

320
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,410
Kai, don't worry.

321
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:16,490
So pretentious. Let's go on.

322
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:52,250
Well,

323
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,560
aren't you tired?

324
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,410
Welcome to the national team.

325
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:18,800
Hello, everyone.

326
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,050
I'm Li Haifeng, your head coach.

327
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:25,530
This is my assistant coach Wang Sen.

328
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,290
- Hi, coach.
- Hi, coach.

329
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:28,640
Well,

330
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,010
after the physical test,

331
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,130
did you feel the harshness
of the national team?

332
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,320
Yes.

333
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,560
I like your honesty.

334
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,200
I'll also be very honest with you.

335
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:44,490
Because of Winter Olympics,
we have many candidates,

336
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,410
and the competition will be intensive.

337
00:15:48,290 --> 00:15:50,470
Based on the current size
and requirements of the team,

338
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,170
only

339
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:55,250
a quarter of you can stay.

340
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,410
More importantly,
this is only the best-case scenario,

341
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:04,720
which means maybe more candidates
will have to leave in the end.

342
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,250
Therefore,

343
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,600
you have to give it

344
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,890
all you've got.

345
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,560
Do your best, understand?

346
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:11,890
- Yes.
- Yes.

347
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:13,250
Understand?

348
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,090
Yes!

349
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,760
Come on.

350
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,050
Starting today,

351
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,680
the first challenge is to change

352
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,910
the way of using strength.

353
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:24,250
Use your hips to drive
the power of your legs.

354
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:26,530
It's very helpful for improving speed.

355
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,250
I'll explain the specific

356
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,370
scientific basis to you
in the training.

357
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,050
You have to pass this challenge

358
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:33,410
before going further.

359
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,040
Speak.

360
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:38,370
How much time do we have?

361
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,720
No time limit,

362
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,720
but

363
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:42,890
the faster, the better.

364
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,650
Any questions?

365
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,140
If not, you'll have ten minutes

366
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,320
to get to know each other

367
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,620
before the formal training.

368
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,530
Gao Kai, come with me.

369
00:16:58,890 --> 00:16:59,730
Well,

370
00:17:00,170 --> 00:17:01,010
how are you guys?

371
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,100
(Nie Chi's Physical Test)

372
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,960
How about him?

373
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,360
In their first
national team physical test,

374
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,080
athletes tend to use more strength

375
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,090
in the beginning,

376
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:14,990
whereas Nie Chi

377
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,560
saved his strength properly,

378
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:19,560
and he was the only one
who made it to the end.

379
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,290
He's smart and calm.

380
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,560
You like him, don't you?

381
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,930
Let's see if he can impress me
in the competition.

382
00:17:28,290 --> 00:17:30,380
Nie Chi, Lin Ge, and Xie Lingwei.

383
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:32,460
Ask them over.

384
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:37,480
Xie Lingwei, Nie Chi, Lin Ge, come here.

385
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,640
- They called me.
- Go.

386
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,250
I watched your physical test results.

387
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:47,400
You did well.

388
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,080
Nie Chi, you'll lead

389
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:52,880
Xie Lingwei later.

390
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:02,730
Lin Ge, listen,

391
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:04,400
you have a mission.

392
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,320
In the next few days, clear your mind.

393
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,970
You only need to imitate
our rival Yang Xiaofei

394
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,210
and see through her.

395
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:14,560
You can come to the women's team
as a training partner.

396
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,360
Yes, coach.

397
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:56,930
Is that enough?

398
00:18:57,770 --> 00:19:00,290
We completed the endurance training

399
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,600
and the 3000m speed intervals.

400
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,320
Can we call it a day?

401
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,560
The women's team is still in training.

402
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:09,890
Did they stop?

403
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,490
I was wondering

404
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,600
why you wouldn't stop or leave.

405
00:19:17,210 --> 00:19:18,600
You're waiting for her.

406
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,730
She's definitely in training.

407
00:19:21,730 --> 00:19:23,120
They finished late recently.

408
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,440
Especially Lin Ge,

409
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,560
she went back so late.

410
00:19:27,930 --> 00:19:28,800
You can go back.

411
00:19:29,930 --> 00:19:30,770
It's near the dorm.

412
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,120
Still want to pick her up?

413
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,440
Still worried?

414
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,290
Wait. Don't you worry about me?

415
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,050
I can't believe this.

416
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,560
(What Zhu said when she left
is like a curse.)

417
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,120
(I soon met real geniuses)

418
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,770
(in the national team.)

419
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,690
(In the meantime,
Nie Chi is also considered)

420
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,690
(to be a genius.)

421
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,840
(Not until now have I realized)

422
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,840
(there's a gap between Nie Chi and me.)

423
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,920
Lin Ge!

424
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,710
(I thought)

425
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,820
(we'd move forward together
at the same pace.)

426
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,120
(When we were kids,)

427
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,450
(I only wanted to win.)

428
00:20:14,450 --> 00:20:15,290
Lin Ge!

429
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:17,880
(But now I want to keep up with him.)

430
00:20:22,450 --> 00:20:23,840
Lin Ge, are you okay?

431
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,360
Let's see the team doctor.

432
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,370
Bro.

433
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,560
Bro, slow down.

434
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,050
My body is shaking like hell.

435
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,530
I'm anxious.

436
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,450
Well, I'll control myself.

437
00:20:39,930 --> 00:20:40,770
Hang in there.

438
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,490
It's done.

439
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,440
Not serious.

440
00:20:44,730 --> 00:20:45,930
You pushed yourself too hard.

441
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,560
Less training next week.

442
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,570
You need a break.

443
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,320
Don't move. I'll get some medicine.

444
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,770
- Thanks, doctor.
- It's okay.

445
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,290
I tried too hard.

446
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,240
I'll take a break tomorrow.

447
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,690
Imitating the rival

448
00:20:58,120 --> 00:20:59,160
is not hurting yourself.

449
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,130
It's a gradual process.

450
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:03,880
I watched Yang Xiaofei's videos
when I had time.

451
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:05,800
She's so fast and powerful.

452
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,320
I have to push my limits

453
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,560
to keep up with her.

454
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,050
Besides, Mr. Li

455
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,120
asked me to imitate her

456
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,530
because he wanted me

457
00:21:13,530 --> 00:21:15,050
to be a training partner for a while.

458
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,360
However, will I be
a training partner forever

459
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,560
and can't go to competitions?

460
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,050
Not necessarily true.

461
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,600
Maybe Mr. Li recognized
your explosive power

462
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,720
and flexibility,

463
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,970
so he chose the most suitable way

464
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,210
for you to practice.

465
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,440
Really?

466
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,770
Yang Xiaofei is outstanding.

467
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,290
No matter what,

468
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:36,840
you'll learn a lot by imitating her,

469
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:37,790
right?

470
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,560
In that case,

471
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:41,210
it's worth it.

472
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,370
Does it hurt?

473
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,360
It hurt a while ago,

474
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,210
but now it's numb.

475
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:56,210
Lie down for a while.

476
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:02,960
Nie Chi.

477
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,770
How does it feel to lead Wei?

478
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,400
It was quite interesting.

479
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,970
It can improve the ability to arrange

480
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:12,160
speed and path,

481
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,210
not just a training partner.

482
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,530
Besides, she's quite fast.

483
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,530
I know she's a true genius.

484
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,210
You were blinded by the light

485
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:26,160
of the genius,

486
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,530
so you lost patience, right?

487
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:33,450
I don't know why,

488
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,400
but I felt strange to watch you

489
00:22:35,770 --> 00:22:37,010
practicing with her.

490
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,690
Forget it.

491
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,490
Something's wrong with my head.

492
00:22:50,490 --> 00:22:52,770
It's okay. You're still cute.

493
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:54,920
How?

494
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:56,360
Cute silly girl.

495
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,800
Do you see

496
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,600
Fang Chao as a cute silly boy?

497
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,800
Lin Ge, be careful.

498
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,800
You used the ointment.

499
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,320
Don't worry. I know myself.

500
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,370
Shan,

501
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,050
can you check on me?

502
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,730
I don't know what happened.

503
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,120
Maybe I used the wrong gesture

504
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,080
in training.

505
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:40,160
My back hurts.

506
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,210
Do you remember the date?

507
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:42,770
Your period is about to come.

508
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,730
I'll take the thermos cup away.

509
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,640
I'll make you brown sugar water
tomorrow.

510
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,360
No ginger, please.

511
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,400
I can't accept it.

512
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,770
I don't like ginger.

513
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:51,970
I know.

514
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,840
It's time to wash up.

515
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,970
I want to rest for a little while.

516
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:57,050
I'm not feeling well.

517
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:58,250
Go now.

518
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,320
Just a little while.

519
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,090
- A little while.
- No. Hurry up.

520
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,290
What if Lin Ge

521
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,490
falls asleep? Hurry.

522
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,770
Shan,

523
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:10,970
why can't I

524
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:12,600
fall asleep when Wei takes a shower?

525
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:14,770
She's too scared
to turn off the lights by herself.

526
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,360
She has to lie down
before you go to sleep.

527
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,640
Do we have to do this every day?

528
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,660
What if I go to bed early?

529
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,840
Don't worry.
I bought remote control lights.

530
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:25,730
They'll arrive tomorrow.

531
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:27,600
She can turn off the lights in bed

532
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,800
with her phone.

533
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,600
I've never heard of it.

534
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,450
I had no choice

535
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:34,690
but to look it up online

536
00:24:34,770 --> 00:24:36,880
and found such good things really exist.

537
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,400
What about before?

538
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,690
No matter how late it was,
I'd turn off the lights for her.

539
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:43,690
We were also roommates
in the sports school

540
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:44,970
and the provincial team.

541
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:50,560
Shan, you're so great.

542
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:53,530
Shan!

543
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:54,680
Coming!

544
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,450
She's amazing.

545
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,360
I talked to Mr. Li yesterday,

546
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,050
and he asked me to
cooperate with you tomorrow.

547
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,210
Really?

548
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:11,770
That's great.

549
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,970
I can finally have fun.

550
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,130
Kid,

551
00:25:19,530 --> 00:25:21,970
I heard you carried Ge around today.

552
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,290
Is that true?

553
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:25,320
Lin Ge got hurt.

554
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,690
I took her to see the doctor.

555
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,010
What?

556
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,800
She got hurt? Where?

557
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:32,250
What happened last night?

558
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,490
It was not serious,

559
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,250
but someone wouldn't get off her.

560
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,900
Oh.

561
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:46,160
Lin Ge is 1.67 meters tall

562
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,400
and weighs 47 kilograms.

563
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,530
I know you can carry her,

564
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,280
but I'm afraid she might fall.

565
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,160
Kid,

566
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,930
it seems someone also knows her well.

567
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,600
Oh, I need to tell you something.

568
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:01,200
Tomorrow,

569
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:02,560
CCTV's documentary team

570
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:03,840
will come here for shooting.

571
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,320
If they interview you,

572
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:08,600
you must be cooperative.

573
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,290
This is our mission.

574
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,360
They've sent us a letter.

575
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,320
Other people can focus on the training.

576
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:17,690
Don't be nervous.

577
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:20,340
- Chao, let me see.
- It's about the Winter Olympics.

578
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,000
Keep a peaceful mind.

579
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,140
(Short Track Speed Skating
CCTV Documentary)

580
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,100
(Yu Siyang, Reporter)

581
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:28,770
Kai, will this be broadcast on TV?

582
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,050
Of course.

583
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,930
- In that case...
- I need to get an X-ray tomorrow.

584
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,010
Can I leave?

585
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,120
Didn't you say you'd practice
the new tactic with me?

586
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:42,160
I forgot the date.

587
00:26:42,530 --> 00:26:43,690
I'll confirm it.

588
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,490
What? You're so unreliable.

589
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,330
Siyang is here.

590
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,130
Siyang!

591
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,690
Siyang!

592
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:03,600
Do you know that pretty girl?

593
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,550
Yes, she used to be our teammate.

594
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:06,690
Her name is Yu Siyang.

595
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,320
She was on our provincial team.

596
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:09,770
She also served the national team

597
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,690
but retired at a young age.

598
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,640
She's so elegant and pretty.

599
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,530
I'm wondering
what we'll do after retirement.

600
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:18,240
Lin Ge, you're very pretty.

601
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,160
Me?

602
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,320
Of course.
We don't usually wear make-up.

603
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:23,640
Besides, you have a pretty face.

604
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:25,680
You'll be stunning
if you get dressed up.

605
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:27,320
- Let me see.
- Right?

606
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:29,600
Big eyes, double eyelids,

607
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,800
and white skin. What a pretty face.

608
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,080
Maybe you can be a star, right?

609
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,360
Jinting, what are you talking about?

610
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:10,880
Okay, let's take a break.

611
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,970
Is Gao Kai that handsome?

612
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,840
I'm looking at the reporter.

613
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:43,640
None of your business.

614
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,560
Isn't he handsome?

615
00:28:46,690 --> 00:28:49,120
No way. He's a psycho.

616
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,970
Look at Gao Kai.

617
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:54,560
He's very capable,

618
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,010
and he's always calm

619
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,160
with a friendly smile.

620
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,250
You're a psycho.

621
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,730
You don't know what it's like
when he's crazy.

622
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,160
It's just a smile.

623
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,160
Do you know the comedian

624
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,560
with a creepy smile?

625
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:15,570
You're just like him.

626
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,930
Ignore me. I'm a psycho.

627
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:19,730
Nie Chi, Xie Lingwei, they'll

628
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,080
interview young members.

629
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:22,290
It's your turn.

630
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,160
Hurry. Don't waste time.

631
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,210
Have a seat.

632
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,810
Xie Lingwei.

633
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,050
How old are you?

634
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,440
Six...

635
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,360
Sixteen.

636
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:51,970
Don't be nervous.

637
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,470
Actually,

638
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:54,530
this is just a daily talk,

639
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,450
and maybe it won't be broadcast.

640
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,690
Do you think you can
go to the Winter Olympics?

641
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:02,080
Nie Chi, what about you?

642
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:03,450
Are you looking forward to going

643
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:04,730
to Pyeongchang Winter Olympics?

644
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,210
I can't deny it,

645
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,690
but I'm aware

646
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:09,530
that I've never been to
such a big event,

647
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,400
so I probably can't
make it to the Olympics.

648
00:30:12,690 --> 00:30:13,530
See?

649
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,600
Nie Chi did well.

650
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,770
Just tell me your real thoughts.

651
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,080
Mr. Li told me

652
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,320
you were born for short track speed skating.

653
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,880
What does short track speed skating

654
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:23,720
mean to you?

655
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:29,120
For me, short track speed skating...

656
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,240
I mean

657
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,250
you can answer frankly like he did,

658
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,560
but he can't answer it for you.

659
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,320
Another one.

660
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,370
For real?

661
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,250
Be careful.

662
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,050
Be careful.

663
00:31:17,730 --> 00:31:18,570
Be careful.

664
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,290
Take a break.

665
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,560
Lin Ge, you should be

666
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,920
more patient, right?

667
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,730
How could I be patient?

668
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,290
Is it because of Xie Lingwei?

669
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,600
Nie Chi told me about it.

670
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,290
I think

671
00:31:41,290 --> 00:31:43,600
you should get over it,

672
00:31:43,730 --> 00:31:44,570
okay?

673
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:46,560
We're on the national team.

674
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,800
It's normal to meet

675
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,210
stronger athletes.

676
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,490
Don't overthink it.

677
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:52,450
Stay calm,

678
00:31:52,450 --> 00:31:54,450
keep a healthy routine,

679
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,320
and work hard in training.

680
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,730
You'll keep up with them one day.

681
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:00,730
Can I keep up with them?

682
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,730
Of course.

683
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:03,290
I believe you can make it.

684
00:32:07,970 --> 00:32:08,880
Speaking of which,

685
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,010
look at Nie Chi

686
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,210
and Xie Lingwei.

687
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,640
They're a good match.

688
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,640
Really?

689
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,770
We're also a good match.

690
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,690
We're even better.

691
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,450
It's completely different.

692
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,970
Why is it different?

693
00:32:34,530 --> 00:32:35,370
Kai.

694
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:36,880
Come here.

695
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,080
- What's wrong?
- Hurry.

696
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,330
Here's the thing.

697
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,360
Well, please be objective.

698
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,880
Are they very different from us?

699
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,450
I don't think so.

700
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:57,400
Are you talking about
performance or appearance?

701
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:01,600
Well, every aspect.

702
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,530
In terms of performance,

703
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,210
I haven't seen the results,
so I can't make a judgment.

704
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,840
As for the appearance...

705
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,080
- What?
- Lin Ge is worthy of

706
00:33:13,010 --> 00:33:14,320
being with anyone.

707
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,120
However, Chao, you're not

708
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,160
as pretty as them.

709
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,880
What? Kai, you're
such a disrespectful senior.

710
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:22,080
I'm disrespectful?

711
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,690
- You're disrespectful.
- Are you serious?

712
00:33:23,690 --> 00:33:24,530
Guys.

713
00:33:24,530 --> 00:33:27,050
I'm standing right here.

714
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:29,010
Can you stop acting like children?

715
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,250
What are you doing?

716
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,210
Didn't you see Lin Ge

717
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,290
was going to hit you?

718
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,120
You're the one who hit me.

719
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,970
There are cameras.

720
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,840
Get off her. Go back to training.

721
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,490
- Chao, stop playing.
- Training.

722
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,690
Go back to training. Work hard.

723
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,050
Let's go back.

724
00:33:51,210 --> 00:33:52,050
Okay.

725
00:34:16,870 --> 00:34:18,990
Why are you eating so much?

726
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,680
None of your business.

727
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,200
I don't need to be interviewed
with a partner.

728
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:25,450
I hope I can get fat.

729
00:34:25,930 --> 00:34:27,450
Anyway, I can only stay here

730
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,530
by imitating Yang Xiaofei.

731
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:30,530
I have to be as strong as her.

732
00:34:32,010 --> 00:34:34,240
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

733
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:36,040
No.

734
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,030
I'm fine.

735
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:45,450
Don't worry.

736
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,160
I'm done.

737
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,520
Siyang.

738
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,720
Gao Kai? Get back to work.

739
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:06,240
Do you miss the meal here?

740
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,400
I can buy you a meal.

741
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:08,490
I wish,

742
00:35:08,930 --> 00:35:09,930
but our team

743
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,410
will eat together.

744
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:13,600
They've worked all day.

745
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:16,050
I think they want to drink
and have meat.

746
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:19,330
Mr. Li should buy your team dinner.

747
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,490
I shouldn't steal his thunder.

748
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,200
Don't call me a miser.

749
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,010
I remember

750
00:35:25,010 --> 00:35:25,930
you were

751
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,970
just a simple teenager.

752
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:30,080
When did you become a glib talker?

753
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,410
I've learned a lot

754
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,760
over the past few years.

755
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:36,810
Why isn't Mingyuan here?

756
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:40,050
He heard you were coming,

757
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,280
so he went to the hospital.

758
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:43,600
He'll come back at night.

759
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:45,280
Still back injury?

760
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,010
Do you think he can
go to this Winter Olympics?

761
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,460
No one knows.

762
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:59,120
He missed two Olympic Games.

763
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:02,680
I hope he can at least participate in it

764
00:36:03,050 --> 00:36:03,970
this time.

765
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:10,890
Since he doesn't want to see me,

766
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,530
don't tell him I asked about him.

767
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:15,120
Let him focus on the Olympics.

768
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:16,250
Don't worry.

769
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,850
If nothing else, I'm leaving.

770
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:20,560
Bye, Siyang.

771
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,560
Bye.

772
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:25,560
Let's call it a day. Let's go.

773
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,560
Shan, can I ask you a question?

774
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,040
Go ahead.

775
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,050
Has Wei been to
any domestic championships?

776
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:37,370
She's outstanding,

777
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:39,080
but I don't think I've seen her before.

778
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,280
She hasn't.

779
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,280
Then how...

780
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:43,970
Get into the national team, right?

781
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,430
No. I know she's very talented.

782
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:47,600
I'm just curious.

783
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:49,160
Why didn't she go to competitions?

784
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,890
How did Mr. Li

785
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,200
find her?

786
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:55,120
She went to a competition after

787
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,200
joining the provincial team

788
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,760
but nearly got injured.

789
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,890
Our province isn't good at ice sports,

790
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:03,160
and it's extremely hard
to find a genius skater.

791
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,050
Therefore, our coach

792
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:06,930
treated her like a treasure.

793
00:37:07,450 --> 00:37:09,010
He also promised her parents not to

794
00:37:09,410 --> 00:37:10,490
send her to competitions

795
00:37:10,850 --> 00:37:12,680
so as to escort her
to the national team.

796
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,080
But she can't gain experience.

797
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,720
It might be a problem
for ordinary people.

798
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:18,920
Wei is different.

799
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,450
She's a genius.

800
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,280
Besides, Mr. Li

801
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,120
met her two years ago

802
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,720
and wanted to take her back.

803
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,010
However, she couldn't leave
the place she was familiar with,

804
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,050
and she wasn't

805
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,720
old enough to sign up for
international competitions,

806
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:35,120
so she didn't come until now.

807
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:37,530
So, are you saying

808
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:40,050
Mr. Li wants to send her
to international competitions?

809
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:43,050
That's what I've heard.

810
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:49,490
Are you going to

811
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:51,600
stay here to look after her?

812
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,120
How's that possible?

813
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,530
You've seen my performance.

814
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,970
They made an exception

815
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,240
to let me help Wei adapt

816
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,810
during the training.

817
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:02,810
But I can't

818
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:04,760
stay here for long.

819
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,370
If that's the case,

820
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:09,720
you'll have to let go
so that she can adapt quickly.

821
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:12,010
You're doing everything for her.

822
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,890
If you really leave the team,

823
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,240
what will she do?

824
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,370
But it's a critical period
for the trial training.

825
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:20,120
She can't be distracted.

826
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,520
Shan,

827
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:25,890
I've said this many times,

828
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:27,170
but I have to tell you.

829
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,680
You're amazing.
