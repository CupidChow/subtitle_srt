I like Lin Ge?

Come here.

Well,

52
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:40,080
I've rescheduled the filming
to the rest days.

53
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,200
- Isn't that enough?
- Rest days

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:44,130
are meant to let them rest.

55
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,240
No training.

56
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,130
But you're

57
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,480
making them work on rest days.

58
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,170
Why don't I keep training them
all the time?

59
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:53,130
Ice Sports are just getting viral.

60
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:54,670
It's a great time for publicity.

61
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,890
More people can know about this.

62
00:02:56,890 --> 00:02:57,730
Isn't it great?

63
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,960
Only gold medals and good results

64
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,170
can make people truly care about this.

65
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:04,760
It seems you're making it viral

66
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:06,240
to attract more people,

67
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,730
but if they mess up the competition,

68
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,080
those people will leave immediately.

69
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,890
Athletes count on good results.

70
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,520
Nothing else matters.

71
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,170
I get it,

72
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,330
but you have to be flexible, Li.

73
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,130
Going out is the megatrend for athletes.

74
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:25,010
Everyone has a phone,

75
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,890
and the world outside is wonderful.

76
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,050
Are you going to blind their eyes?

77
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:31,290
But they're athletes.

78
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,290
They accept national allowances

79
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:35,130
and the best training.

80
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,290
Why should they
care about the outside world?

81
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,680
If they want to live a wonderful life
like others,

82
00:03:40,050 --> 00:03:41,730
why don't they retire?

83
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,080
Why are you so stubborn?

84
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,850
We can't

85
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,920
reach a common ground on this.
It's enough.

86
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:54,290
Anything else?

87
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,250
No.

88
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,520
I'm speechless.

89
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,970
I have a filming task,

90
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,050
but I forgot where I put my tripod head.

91
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,800
Do you mind being my human tripod?

92
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,520
I do.

93
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,280
Fine.

94
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,480
I'll have to ask Lin Ge.

95
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
Wait.

96
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,610
Why Lin Ge?

97
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,090
Xie Lingwei will be there too.

98
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
If you don't help me,

99
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:39,680
I'll have to ask them.

100
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,520
I'll help you.

101
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,400
I know.

102
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,320
I don't want to go,

103
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,560
but our manager insisted.

104
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:49,850
I can take two girls.

105
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,360
Any advice?

106
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,570
Lin Ge.

107
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,250
Seven Gold!

108
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:05,370
Wei.

109
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,410
I was calling you.

110
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,250
What's wrong, Kai?

111
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,610
Do you want to go to
a variety show with us?

112
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,050
Will Wei be there?

113
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,450
- Of course.
- Then I'm in.

114
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
I'll get changed.

115
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,880
I need two more boys.

116
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
What variety show?

117
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,770
Are you the guests?

118
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,730
What's the content?

119
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:28,810
Is there a contract?

120
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:30,530
Why are you asking so much?

121
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,290
I don't want to be set up.

122
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:48,210
Fang Chao did well today.

123
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,410
Did he get a tip?

124
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:00,170
Well done.

125
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,560
How did you make it?

126
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,970
Yesterday, I found it hard
to lead the race,

127
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,680
so I stayed close behind Seven Gold.

128
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,090
That's Xinxin.

129
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,480
We always call him that.

130
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,480
Today, I just gave it all I got

131
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,530
without thinking too much.

132
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:20,360
When Seven Gold slowed down,

133
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,200
I tried to pass him.

134
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,530
Anyway, I have the best stamina.

135
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,050
What else?

136
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,650
Just skate at my own pace

137
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:30,850
and stay calm.

138
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:32,850
Don't worry about being passed.

139
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,290
Find a chance to pass them.

140
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,440
It's okay to lead the race.

141
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll convince myself

142
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,800
that I have the best stamina.

143
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,850
Good. Your idea?

144
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:48,210
He taught me that.

145
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,400
You?

146
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:55,000
The last person

147
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:56,970
has trained you to be in second place?

148
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,840
What happened?

149
00:07:10,170 --> 00:07:11,680
Nie Chi told me

150
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,360
to tell Fang Chao,

151
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:16,000
but he wouldn't let me tell Fang Chao

152
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,240
he told me to do so.

153
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,320
Is this a tongue twister?

154
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,010
No.

155
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,240
Why did Nie Chi come?

156
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,680
He gave me a flash drive,

157
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,530
saying there are race videos.

158
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm glad you're helping each other.

159
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,170
However, Fang Chao,

160
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,090
I hope you can think independently.

161
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,560
Use your brain.

162
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:53,410
1500 meters is a long distance
with many variables.

163
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,210
It requires you to be more flexible.

164
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,290
You can't count on others
to tell you what to do

165
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:00,050
before every competition,

166
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,610
right?

167
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,050
Got it, coach.

168
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,690
Okay.

169
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,650
Think about it.

170
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,290
Bye, coach.

171
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,730
What's wrong?

172
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,130
Listen,

173
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:44,890
I don't need you

174
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,130
to help me with tactics anymore.

175
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,370
Why are you avoiding me?

176
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,320
At least we're teammates.

177
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,010
Are you going to change
the order of relay?

178
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,490
It's possible.

179
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:03,530
Do we have to end up like this?

180
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,250
I'm saying this one last time.

181
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,170
I want to handle it myself.

182
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,410
I admit I'm not as smart

183
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,650
as you,

184
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,840
but I want to count on myself.

185
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:22,010
I think you're overthinking it.

186
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,170
If you didn't know

187
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,770
I was the one who helped you,

188
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,650
you wouldn't overthink it, right?

189
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,720
Yes.

190
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,080
I can accept help

191
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,960
from anyone except you.

192
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,800
Fine.

193
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,370
I'll apologize.

194
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,560
No need.

195
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,600
Neither Lin Ge nor you

196
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,200
owe me anything.

197
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,410
It's not your fault.

198
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,200
But I'm sad.

199
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:10,770
It's not my fault either.

200
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,720
(2016 Youth Championship List)
Nie Chi, 500m and 1000m.

201
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,130
Fang Chao, 1500m.

202
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:34,410
Wei, you're 500m.

203
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:36,320
- We're both 500m.
- We both got in.

204
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,200
I'll tell him.

205
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,040
Okay.

206
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,440
The list was released.

207
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,600
We all got singles.

208
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,890
I'm 500m.

209
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,080
You're 500m and 1000m.

210
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,080
Fang Chao is 1500m.

211
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,130
What about me?

212
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:50,050
Sorry, I didn't notice.

213
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,080
It's okay.
Seven Gold, let's take a look.

214
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,920
Let's go.

215
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,650
Still angry?

216
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,490
It takes time.

217
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,840
Focus on the competition.

218
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,530
This Youth Championship is different.

219
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,250
No senior teammates.

220
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,920
So, I can skate as fast as I want

221
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,600
instead of covering for others, right?

222
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,890
Go back to training.

223
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:27,920
Mr. Li is talking to

224
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,920
different event groups.

225
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,960
I think it's about the tactics.

226
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,650
As for the tactics,

227
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,680
don't overthink it.

228
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,680
Just take it easy.

229
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:38,960
I'm not like you.

230
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,410
I'm so nervous.

231
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:43,680
Right now, we need to relax

232
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,770
and clear our minds.

233
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:49,080
Okay. Ask them over.

234
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:00,560
Mr. Li wants to talk to you.

235
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,440
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

236
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:10,130
- Coach.
- Coach.

237
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,680
Are you nervous about the competition?

238
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:13,850
No.

239
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,490
No. I'm excited.

240
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:16,840
It's good,

241
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,440
but don't be too excited.

242
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:22,770
You need to adjust yourself gradually.

243
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:25,290
Save your greatest passion
for the competition.

244
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:26,730
Got it.

245
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,250
With your ability,
unless you make mistakes,

246
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,890
you'll get into the final.

247
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,770
So, I'm going to tell you

248
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,410
the tactics of the final.

249
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,290
Lin Ge, you have a great responsibility.

250
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,130
You need to cover for Xie Lingwei
in the final.

251
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,370
I know you care about this competition.

252
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,600
Since the Huarong Cup,

253
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,530
you've worked hard for half a year

254
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,490
because you want to prove yourself

255
00:12:58,600 --> 00:12:59,520
in this competition.

256
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
It's obvious that I'm not as good

257
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,170
as Wei.

258
00:13:03,550 --> 00:13:04,770
She'll be the core

259
00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:06,130
of our cooperation.

260
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:09,320
You've figured it out.

261
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:10,720
Why are you so upset?

262
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,560
I don't want
to cover for others forever.

263
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,840
This time, all the participants
are our peers,

264
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,680
no seniors.

265
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,650
I thought

266
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,290
Mr. Li would let us fight for ourselves,

267
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,960
but it turns out
I still need to cover for Wei.

268
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,050
It occurred to me

269
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,920
that Zhu Zhu once told me

270
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,320
even if I'm a fast horse,

271
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,490
I'll meet

272
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,840
a faster leopard.

273
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,960
I used to think she was

274
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,490
trying to make an excuse
for her mistakes.

275
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,530
Now I finally understand.

276
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:41,010
Understand what?

277
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,320
I understand why she hated me

278
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,370
and why she was so desperate.

279
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,320
But don't worry.

280
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:51,770
I won't lose control.

281
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,250
Do you remember I asked you
to compete with her

282
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,890
before joining the provincial team?

283
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,800
You can't join us unless it's

284
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,840
less than 48 seconds.

285
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,170
Lin Ge, the second place,

286
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,530
47.97 seconds.

287
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:13,200
Only when competing with stronger people
can you be faster.

288
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,840
Lin Ge, don't be upset.

289
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,080
Even if we have a late start,

290
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,440
we will find our places.

291
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:23,290
I'll be with you.

292
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,370
Okay.

293
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:28,320
I haven't competed for a long time.

294
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,720
Let's finish it first.

295
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:32,850
For our dreams.

296
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,680
We can make it.

297
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,800
Men's 500m Final

298
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,320
has reached the last stage.

299
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,490
The participants are very close.

300
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,560
Nie Chi is leading the race.

301
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,850
He crossed the line!

302
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,320
We're looking at the Women's 500m Final.

303
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,410
Lin Ge has guarded the way
for Xie Lingwei.

304
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:50,720
The genius girl Xie Lingwei

305
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,170
is leading the race.

306
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:53,650
Sprint!

307
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,650
She won!

308
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,250
Let's talk after the press conference.

309
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,920
What's wrong?

310
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,680
So many people.

311
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,410
You're world champions.

312
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,250
Why are you scared?

313
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:12,170
Don't be nervous on the stage. Let's go.

314
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,820
(World Youth Short Track Speed Skating
Championship Press Conference)

315
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:29,770
The press conference
has officially begun.

316
00:15:29,890 --> 00:15:31,130
Reporters, please ask questions.

317
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,210
Mr. Li,

318
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,530
are you satisfied with the results?

319
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,730
First of all,

320
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,960
dear press friends,

321
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,650
thank you for your concern and support.

322
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:42,960
As we know,

323
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:45,960
the national team
has the best short track

324
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,960
- Well done.
- speed skaters.

325
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:49,640
So,

326
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,890
I'm satisfied.

327
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,800
You secured the second place

328
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:54,800
the whole time,

329
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,130
the person behind you couldn't pass you.

330
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:59,440
She nearly passed me in the curves.

331
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,860
They're strong opponents.

332
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,550
They're both...

333
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,800
Mr. Li is ridiculous.

334
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,050
Silver medal is amazing.

335
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,920
Why can't you go on the stage?

336
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,050
Don't say that.

337
00:16:09,370 --> 00:16:10,600
As for Xie Lingwei,

338
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,200
she's got the best endurance

339
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,490
and concentration.

340
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:16,370
Therefore, we told her to lead the race

341
00:16:16,370 --> 00:16:17,770
the whole time.

342
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,320
Okay. Thanks, Mr. Li.

343
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:20,850
Hello, Wei.

344
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,040
You broke

345
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:23,960
the Youth Championship record of 500m.

346
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,600
How do you feel now?

347
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,080
(Xie Lingwei)
Happy and nervous.

348
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,560
Mr. Li said

349
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,890
your tactic was to lead the race.

350
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,170
What's your opinion?

351
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,650
If I lead the race,

352
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:37,920
they can't affect me,

353
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,920
and that's safer.

354
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,770
Weren't you worried
that they might pass you?

355
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,560
No.

356
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:52,760
Why?

357
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,050
Because I'm the fastest.

358
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:55,800
Okay. Thanks.

359
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:57,050
How could she say that?

360
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:59,490
If you hadn't covered for her,

361
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,170
would she have won so easily?

362
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,010
Now that she's won the gold medal,

363
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:04,600
shouldn't she thank you?

364
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:06,210
- Stop.
- Any questions?

365
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:08,500
- Wei is a simple girl.
- Okay. This one.

366
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,770
Nie Chi, this is also
your first Youth Championship,

367
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,560
and you won the Men's 500m.

368
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,360
Is there anything you want to say?

369
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:21,760
(Nie Chi)

370
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:22,800
I want to thank someone.

371
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,200
Who?

372
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,840
The person who's been there for me.

373
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,920
Okay.

374
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,120
Oh, no, Lin Ge.

375
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,690
I can't find my colorful rope.

376
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,560
It's missing?

377
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,210
Yes. When I left the stage,

378
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,010
it disappeared from my hand.

379
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:02,500
You can't race without it?

380
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,120
My grandma gave it to me

381
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,450
to protect me.

382
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,210
If I don't wear it in competitions,

383
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:08,880
I'll definitely get injured.

384
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,880
What should I do?

385
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:11,930
Oh my god. I...

386
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,160
Look, what's this?

387
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,840
You found it.

388
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,400
Do you know where I found it?

389
00:18:16,730 --> 00:18:18,770
- No.
- It slipped from your pocket.

390
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,290
Put it on.

391
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:22,160
You're so careless.

392
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,010
Amazing.

393
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,490
Thank god you're here.

394
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,400
I'm important at moments like this,
right?

395
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,820
You're always important.

396
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,320
- Wei. Take a photo.
- Let me see.

397
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,840
Okay. I have to go.

398
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:32,680
Go.

399
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,210
Well, closer, closer.

400
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,160
Good.

401
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,770
Come on.

402
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,240
Smile.

403
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,160
Very good.

404
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,010
Champions,

405
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:46,490
please raise your gold medals.

406
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,330
Go on.

407
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:49,370
Lin Ge.

408
00:18:49,490 --> 00:18:50,500
- Coach.
- Look at me.

409
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,210
That was great cooperation.

410
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:54,400
Thanks, Coach.

411
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:56,290
But I noticed you were exhausted

412
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,800
in the last lap,

413
00:18:57,800 --> 00:18:58,930
and they nearly passed you.

414
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:02,560
You need to do more physical training.

415
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,800
Keep it up.

416
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:08,530
Got it.

417
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:16,880
Okay. Champions,

418
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,450
please show me your medals.

419
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,450
Yes, closer.

420
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:40,260
(World Youth Short Track Speed Skating
Championship, Women's 500m, Silver Medal)

421
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,360
(Honorary Champions)
Wei, I'll help you.

422
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,210
No need.

423
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,320
It's okay. I have strength.

424
00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:49,530
Give me.

425
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:50,370
Okay.

426
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,010
I've been too busy

427
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,320
to talk to you.

428
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,640
Let's hang out.

429
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,080
I want to take a nap.

430
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,400
Wei didn't feel well last night,

431
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:03,560
so I got up twice
to get hot water for her.

432
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,360
Then see you later.

433
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:07,450
Okay.

434
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:09,800
Lin Ge, I forget my key.

435
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:10,770
Coming.

436
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
You should be together.

437
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
They say you're a good match.

438
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,800
Exactly.

439
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,080
- Stop.
- Look. Here it is.

440
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,730
- So weird.
- Exactly.

441
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,970
The comments say they're a good match.

442
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,320
You're all here.

443
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,770
What are you talking about?

444
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:30,840
You're awake.

445
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,880
Several official media accounts

446
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,840
just posted the photos
of Wei and Nie Chi,

447
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,770
and there are so many comments.

448
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,640
They say

449
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,800
they're the official couple
of the national team.

450
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,920
Look.

451
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,210
So many comments.

452
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,880
(I've finally become a man
who deserves you.)

453
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,880
(Champion couple.)
Go ahead.

454
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
It's really wild.

455
00:20:50,690 --> 00:20:51,970
They even wrote a novel

456
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,930
in the comments.

457
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,250
Nie Chi

458
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,320
worked hard to stand on the same stage

459
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,840
with Wei.

460
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:58,930
He finally won the gold medal.

461
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,770
I've finally become a man
who deserves you.

462
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:09,840
They're

463
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,290
talking nonsense, huh?

464
00:21:14,290 --> 00:21:15,320
They're just joking.

465
00:21:15,530 --> 00:21:16,640
They'll forget it very soon.

466
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,730
Don't take it seriously.

467
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,800
It's not like that.

468
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:22,210
I'm worried that if Xie Lingwei sees

469
00:21:22,210 --> 00:21:23,400
too many comments,

470
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:25,880
she'll have feelings for Nie Chi.

471
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,210
It'll be a mess.

472
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,770
What are they talking about?

473
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,640
It's a wrong matchmaking.

474
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,770
Nie Chi's closest friend is Lin Ge.

475
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,010
You don't know.

476
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,560
Maybe he learned from

477
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:39,450
Jin Xinxin's mistakes,

478
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:41,560
and he wants to use Lin Ge to get Wei.

479
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,800
It's not like that.

480
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,730
There's nothing between us.

481
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,080
Stop saying that.

482
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,930
Lin Ge, are you Nie Chi's girlfriend?

483
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,970
So, everything is possible.

484
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,600
Besides, they're both
young and successful.

485
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,690
What a good match.

486
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:05,640
Wei, don't you agree?

487
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,570
I...

488
00:22:09,690 --> 00:22:11,800
I don't know.

489
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,530
Which means it's possible.

490
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:14,920
Let me ask you,

491
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,250
who's more handsome,

492
00:22:16,250 --> 00:22:17,200
Jin Xinxin or Nie Chi?

493
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:22,050
Nie Chi.

494
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:23,840
Among the boys in the men's team,

495
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,640
who will you watch a movie with?

496
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,450
Nie Chi.

497
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,450
Who do you want to receive

498
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,730
milk tea from?

499
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,530
Maybe Nie Chi.

500
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,840
So, you like him.

501
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,160
What?

502
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:45,690
Those involved are often confused.

503
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:46,600
Lin Ge,

504
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,880
are you really not
in a relationship with him?

505
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,250
Yes, you like him.

506
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,560
- Don't be embarrassed.
- Exactly.

507
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,530
Not a big deal.

508
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:57,400
I'm hungry. Let's eat something.

509
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,510
- She's blushing.
- Yes.

510
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,400
- No. I'm not hungry.
- Tell me more.

511
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,560
Let's go.

512
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:05,120
Jinting, I want to take a walk alone.

513
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,840
The netizens know what's going on.

514
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,250
You're the only one

515
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:10,600
who hasn't realized it.

516
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:11,880
- Stop kidding.
- Exactly.

517
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:15,970
Nie Chi, talk to Lin Ge.

518
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:23,490
(Is it tragic to be in the same era)

519
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:25,320
(with a genius athlete?)

520
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:28,730
(Is it more tragic to be
in the same era)

521
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,360
(with her)

522
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,120
(and refuse to give up?)

523
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:36,080
(Now I finally understand
why Zhu Zhu was indifferent.)

524
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,690
(If we're meant to be opponents,)

525
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,560
(we shouldn't make friends
in the first place.)

526
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,120
(But no one has ever told me)

527
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,080
(how to solve it
when we're already friends.)

528
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,600
Jinting said you were upset.

529
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:52,370
What's wrong?

530
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,880
Is it because they made fun of

531
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,770
Xie Lingwei and me?

532
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,400
I have no feelings for her.

533
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,600
But everyone thinks

534
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,690
she deserves you
because she won the gold medal.

535
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,510
But what's that got to do with me?

536
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,990
I only like you.

537
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:11,120
I don't even deserve
to stand beside you.

538
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,970
You don't need the gold medal
to stand beside me.

539
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,370
You don't understand!

540
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,120
I've finally realized this.

541
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:19,450
You deserve someone better than me,

542
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,290
whether it's family background
or financial capacity.

543
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,320
I won a silver medal,

544
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,530
but compared to your gold medals,

545
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,600
I'm just a loser.

546
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,730
Lin Ge, don't look down on yourself.

547
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,160
I believe one day,

548
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,050
you'll win the gold medal.

549
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,450
One day?

550
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:47,880
When will it happen?

551
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,850
Lin Ge,

552
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,730
I can't tell you the exact date.

553
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,040
But I believe you,
and you have to believe

554
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,770
the day will eventually come,

555
00:25:03,690 --> 00:25:04,880
because you're Lin Ge.

556
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,290
Your competitive spirit

557
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:08,120
will lead you to success.

558
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,400
Can you wait for me?

559
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,360
I want to stand beside you

560
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,770
with a gold medal.

561
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,400
I don't want to wait.

562
00:25:26,530 --> 00:25:27,450
Let's tell them.

563
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,130
Let's tell

564
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,290
everyone

565
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,120
we're together, okay?

566
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,450
Are you trying

567
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,160
to reassure me?

568
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,490
I just want everyone to know

569
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:55,840
you're my girlfriend.

570
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,930
Sis, why did you ask me out this late?

571
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:15,890
Just to sit here?

572
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,800
Lin Ge is upset.

573
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,400
I'm worried Nie Chi can't find her.

574
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:20,290
I'll wait for her.

575
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,970
Do you think Lin Ge and Nie Chi

576
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,050
are together?

577
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,450
Who knows?

578
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,770
After all, given what happened
to Chen Mingyuan,

579
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,490
who dares to date a teammate?

580
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:41,120
What are you...?

581
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,250
- Going back.
- Dating.

582
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,970
Jinting, when you asked me,

583
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:48,010
we weren't together,

584
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:49,160
so I didn't lie.

585
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,600
This is crazy. So crazy.

586
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,970
No matter how crazy you are,

587
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,530
you have to control yourselves,

588
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,250
especially in front of Mr. Li.

589
00:26:58,490 --> 00:26:59,560
This is about attitude.

590
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:00,890
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

I'm happy.

(Please Forgive Me!)

598

What are you doing?

599
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,490
Writing a love letter?

600
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:39,890
Why did you

601
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,640
suddenly decide to get together?

602
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,400
Are you studying the video?

603
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,050
Are you bipolar?

604
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:54,960
It's for Fang Chao.

605
00:27:55,660 --> 00:27:57,560
No password. Suit yourself.

606
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,250
Isn't Fang Chao across from us?

607
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,290
Just ask him over to see it.

608
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:06,050
Are you really going to be strangers?

609
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
You're like an arguing couple.

610
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:10,400
Who's your real girlfriend?

611
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,010
What a brat.

00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,530
What a great show.

615
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,240
Fang Chao.

616
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:44,610
Fang Chao!

Get up. Hurry.

622
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,250
Wait. I'm looking for it.

623
00:29:18,730 --> 00:29:19,730
It was there.

624
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,290
Where is it?

625
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,050
How could you delete it?

626
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,290
Fang Chao.

627
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,880
He wanted to confess to you.

628
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,840
Oh, no, apology video.

629
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:41,970
Many hearts. So cheesy.

630
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,840
I'll leave you alone.

631
00:29:54,050 --> 00:29:56,450
Be a man. Apologize to him.

632
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,210
What video?

633
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,930
Nothing. Don't listen to him.

634
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,160
I was also looking for you.

635
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,970
Here's the thing.

636
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,980
I want to go home during the holidays.

637
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:24,490
I won't visit Ms. Han with you.

638
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,370
Okay.

639
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,080
(National Ice Sports Base)
Bye.

640
00:30:42,210 --> 00:30:43,360
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

641
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,440
Bye.

642
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,120
Did Fang Chao say that

643
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,240
to stop us from going to his home?

644
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,860
Maybe he's still feeling awkward
about our relationship.

645
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,880
Are we really going to be strangers?

646
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,600
At least he told me

647
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,530
he wanted to go home.

648
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,840
It's getting better.

649
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,090
Let's go.

Sir, I'm Lin Ge,

653
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:43,490
and he's Nie Chi.

654
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,360
I'm so forgetful.

655
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,800
Lin Chi, no packages for you.

656
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,730
Sir, stop looking.

657
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,600
I don't have packages.

658
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,930
You don't have packages,

659
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,770
neither does Nie Ge.

00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:07,210
I'm back.

661
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:11,250
You texted me three minutes ago.

662
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,450
You really freaked me out.

663
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,160
Look, it's spilled.

664
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,590
How can you wear nail polish?

665
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:20,970
Why can't I? It's my day off.

666
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:21,810
I'll clean it tonight.

667
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:23,600
Well, it looks good.

668
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,640
I know.

669
00:32:28,450 --> 00:32:29,290
Hello, Senior Sister.

670
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,730
I'll check my room.

671
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,320
I'll come back when I'm settled.

672
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:37,570
Bye.

673

Something's wrong.

674
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,600
Come back when he's settled?

675
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,530
For what?

676
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,320
Stop joking.

677
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,970
Ms. Han wants to talk to me.

678
00:32:49,970 --> 00:32:50,930
See you later.

Wait. Are you dating him?

680
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,490
Focus on your nail polish.

681
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,400
So boring.

682
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:04,880
Ms. Han, I miss you so much.

683
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:06,840
You're so strong.

684
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,490
I've been doing strength training

685
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:11,160
and eating a lot lately.

686
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,970
It must've been stressful.

687
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,840
I don't want to let you down.

688
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:18,840
It's not embarrassing
to lose to Xie Lingwei.

689
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,320
You know her?

690
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:23,970
I've never seen someone

691
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,290
who can control their bodies so well.

692
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,880
Besides, she knows ice so well.

693
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,210
With the same move,

694
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:31,640
she can glide farther than others.

695
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,250
Are you giving up?

696
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,320
Tell me, what are you thinking?

697
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:41,320
I'm not as good as her right now,

698
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,970
but I don't want to give up

699
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:45,800
or cover for her forever.

700
00:33:46,450 --> 00:33:48,490
I think if Mr. Li

701
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:49,930
can free me from the responsibilities

702
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:51,160
in the competitions,

703
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:53,050
maybe I can beat her.

704
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:55,640
That's the student I trained.

705
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,210
No matter what, you can't be scared.

706
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:00,610
Ms. Han,

707
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,690
what do you think I should do?

708
00:34:04,290 --> 00:34:06,290
I think Li Haifeng has

709
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,320
his own reasons.

710
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,560
Covering for others is not a bad thing.

711
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,280
You can gain experience
by defending the way.

712
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:15,970
Strength training can improve
your sprinting ability.

713
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,280
He's been trying to push you forward.

714
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:22,970
Ms. Han, you've really enlightened me.

715
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,490
I love you!

716
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,960

717
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,760

720
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,280
Look at him.

721
00:34:52,970 --> 00:34:54,410
He's doing this again.

722
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:55,730
Do you think

723
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:58,200
he's having trouble with them?

724
00:34:58,970 --> 00:35:01,280
They used to hang out together
all the time, didn't they?

725
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,560
What trouble? He's a lovelorn boy.

726
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,890
What do you mean?

727
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,330
Do you mean they...?

728
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,160
Really?

729
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,600
Here. Look.

730
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,370
Why did Wang send you...?

731
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,490
Stop looking.

732
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,490
It's not about that.

733
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:28,850
Look at this.

734
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,760
(Love the fish in the aquarium.)

735
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,600
Look.

Oh my god.

She's wearing so little.

738
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,290
Isn't she cold?

739
