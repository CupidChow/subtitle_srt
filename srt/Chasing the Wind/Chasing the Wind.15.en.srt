00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,170
you need to cover for Wei in the final.

Let's make it open.

34
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,280
I just want them all to know

35
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,050
you are my girlfriend.

36
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,360
This holiday,

37
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,360
I won't go back to Ms. Han with you.

38
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:03,560
Do I

39
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,890
like Lin Ge?

=When Did You Start Liking Me?=

41
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,960
This is my first time coming to such a place.

42
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,050
There are many places I haven't been to.

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,200
It's ok.

44
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,410
I will take you to those places one by one.

45
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,340
Look over there, so many fish!

46
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,850
Look at this one, it's so small!

47
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:04,730
Let me take a picture.

48
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,570
Look! They are swimming away.

49
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,170
Nie Chi,

50
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,570
I have a question to ask you.

51
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:13,730
What is it?

52
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,920
When did you start liking me?

53
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:20,170
Was it when you gave me the panda?

54
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,880
It was earlier than that.

55
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:26,920
Was that when you paid 2,000 for me

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,880
at the sports school?

57
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:32,770
No?

58
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:37,770
That couldn't be our first meeting, right?

59
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,290
It was just that time.

60
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,560
Did you fall in love with me at first sight?

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,440
After all these years,

62
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,850
have you been plotting this all along?

63
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,530
Why didn't I notice

64
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,920
you have so much on your mind before?

65
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,120
Do you remember that year

66
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,560
we ate dumplings for the New Year

67
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,240
and you found a coin in yours?

68
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,130
I remember.

69
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,360
I was so lucky that day.

70
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,770
How could I possibly forget?

71
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,560
I did it on purpose.

72
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:09,050
I left a mark when I made dumplings.

73
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,080
Wait a moment.

74
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,490
Why?

75
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,770
Let me show you something.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,680
Guess what it is.

77
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:23,530
Why have you been keeping it?

78
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:24,960
You guess.

79
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,290
I guess

80
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,090
you are unwilling to waste money.

81
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,880
I have nothing to do today.

82
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:45,610
How about drinking some wine with me?

83
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,610
What do you mean, Dad?

84
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,850
I can't drink. I'm an athlete.

85
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:00,170
So what?

86
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:01,970
It's a holiday. What are you afraid of?

87
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:04,880
Just one sip. Can't you recover after a month?

88
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,920
Have some.

89
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,730
Come on, my silly boy.

90
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:13,970
Don't always call me silly boy.

91
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,920
I originally was not stupid.

92
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,560
Your words make me stupid.

93
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,850
Don't I have any advantages?

94
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,320
Oh my gosh.

95
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,730
Then to be honest with me,

96
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,650
why did you come back this time?

97
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,360
Is it because of relationship issues?

98
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,290
Is it because of Lin Ge?

99
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,450
No.

100
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,680
How boring you are. You keep asking.

101
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:37,610
Fine.

102
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,410
Then I'll drink it.

103
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,320
Let me tell you,

104
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,320
as the old saying goes,

105
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,650
there are more disappointments in life.

106
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,770
You can't take everything to heart.

107
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,650
Better to drink some wine

108
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:09,610
to relieve your worries.

109
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,200
I mean it.

110
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:13,970
Listen to me.

111
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:15,800
I have been there.

112
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,860
Relationship issues, you know...

113
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:20,170
I don't know.

114
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:21,610
Then let me tell you.

115
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:22,610
I don't want to listen.

116
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,130
Back then

117
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:27,560
there were so many people

118
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:29,610
who pursued your mom.

119
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,610
What a beautiful place.

120
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,680
I want to take a few more pictures.

121
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,390
Let me take a picture for you.

122
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:06,850
Ok. Then make me look taller

123
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:07,690
and nicer.

124
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,850
Is it ok? Does it look good?

125
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,610
Pretty good.

126
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,680
When did you start to be smooth-talking?

127
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,370
I didn't.

128
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,800
I'm speaking the truth.

129
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:39,440
All right.

130
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:43,920
I closed my eyes. Do I look good?

131
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,080
Anyway, you look good in my eyes.

132
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Delete it quickly.

133
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,250
Well...

134
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,370
I remember you didn't like taking pictures,

135
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,440
so I didn't look into this thing.

136
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,490
I'll learn it after I get back today.

137
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,250
Really?

138
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,600
So what level do you plan to learn it to?

139
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,440
Like him.

140
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:24,250
Don't you like saving money?

141
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:25,960
After I learn it,

142
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,890
you'll be able to save a lot of money.

143
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,440
All right.

144
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,890
At that time,

145
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,890
you will act as a free photographer.

146
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,290
I don't know whose arm I will hold.

147
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,320
It makes me quite looking forward to it.

148
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,290
Who else can you hold besides me?

149
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,680
Where's our son?

150
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,920
I let you talk to him about the feelings.

151
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,640
How come you...

152
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,640
Son.

153
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:35,730
Son.

154
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,440
Mom.

155
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:45,800
Drink more.

156
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,290
Not drinking anymore.

157
00:10:56,290 --> 00:10:57,130
I...

158
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:02,130
I still can't figure it out.

159
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,440
Nie Chi and Lin Ge...

160
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,840
Yes, they knew each other before I did.

161
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:09,850
Then

162
00:11:10,050 --> 00:11:12,370
Nie Chi helped Lin Ge get into the school.

163
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,320
After this, he left.

164
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,800
Wasn't it me

165
00:11:16,130 --> 00:11:18,370
who accompanied Lin Ge

166
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,130
from childhood until now?

167
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,680
- Yes.
- You know, right, Mom?

168
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,840
You're here, right?

169
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,440
Is it that I have no advantages?

170
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,250
Of course not.

171
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,370
Son, look.

172
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:34,600
You are kind, filial, and hardworking.

173
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:37,440
You are a strong and manly man.

174
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,250
I have always been proud of you.

175
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,610
Really?

176
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,290
Do you really think so?

177
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,720
Of course.

178
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,600
How excellent you are!

179
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,960
Then why doesn't she like me?

180
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:52,330
That is...

181
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:55,410
There is no logic to matters of the love.

182
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:59,410
For example, when I was young,

183
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,320
I was gentle, beautiful, and talented.

184
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,370
Many people liked me.

185
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,700
I mean it.

186
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,170
Were they not as good as your dad?

187
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,720
Of course not.

188
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,320
Actually, everyone was better than your dad.

189
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,530
But I just like your dad.

190
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,650
Look at him. He's not handsome at all.

191
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:17,890
You can't say it, Mom.

192
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,650
If so, how do I like?

193
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:22,320
How can that be the same?

194
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,750
A boy's genes come from his mom.

195
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:28,410
The Fang family changed because of me.

196
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,800
Change the fate?

197
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,680
Change the fate.

198
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,730
All right.

199
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,160
But I...

200
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,800
I still think Nie Chi is better than me.

201
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,410
He skated better than me.

202
00:12:45,130 --> 00:12:46,840
His family conditions are better than mine.

203
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,840
Maybe he looks...

204
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:51,010
Son,

205
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:55,650
I don't think you have figured it out.

206
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:59,490
Relationships are not about conditions.

207
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,560
It's not the comparison.

208
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:04,440
For example, if there is a boy

209
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,200
who is richer than Nie Chi

210
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,250
and is more handsome,

211
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,490
do you think Lin Ge

212
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,600
will leave Nie Chi because of this?

213
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
Impossible.

214
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:15,130
Exactly.

215
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,530
So it's not about the conditions.

216
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:21,290
It's just that Lin Ge happens

217
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,290
to like someone like Nie Chi.

218
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,520
Mom,

219
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,130
I understand the reasoning.

220
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,600
About this matter, neither Nie Chi

221
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,530
nor Lin Ge is wrong.

222
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:37,890
You're not wrong either.

223
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,680
But I feel bad.

224
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,890
Then cry it out.

225
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,250
Let it out. Don't hold it back.

226
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:47,490
Son, let me tell you,

227
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,550
you go find Nie Chi and fight.

228
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,960
I support you.

229
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,720
Go find him to fight.

230
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,250
I have fought.

231
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,770
Have you?

232
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,700
I have.

233
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,680
I kicked his ass.

234
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,650
You won, huh?

235
00:14:01,650 --> 00:14:02,840
I gave him to punches.

236
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:04,560
Good boy.

237
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,530
But I felt a bit regretful after the fight.

238
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,840
It's fine, son.

239
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:14,010
I believe

240
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:16,410
you have a sense of measure, right?

241
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,370
So have you already thought

242
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:27,290
about not having any interaction

243
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:29,560
with them for the rest of your life?

244
00:14:31,050 --> 00:14:32,080
Have you decided yet?

245
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,400
No.

246
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,170
Next time you go home,

247
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,050
you must bring both of them back.

248
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:47,800
Ok?

249
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:51,760
Ok.

250
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,170
You have grown up.

251
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,280
Come.

252
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,530
I will drink with you.

253
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:15,800
Here.

254
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:22,960
Thank you, Mom.

255
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,650
Good boy.

256
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,250
I love you.

257
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,370
Love you.

- Come downstairs.

291

Come on, let's fight.

292
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:28,560
Nie Chi, do you take me as a brother?

293
00:17:29,010 --> 00:17:30,560
Are you taking me as a brother?

294
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,880
The three of us stay together every day.

295
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,800
Now you think I'm a fool, right?

296
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,770
My family is not as good as yours.

297
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:40,800
I'm not as good as you either.

298
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:44,080
You've been the best among us

299
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,160
since you were a kid.

300
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,050
Everyone's around you.

301
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,600
You are the best.

302
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,770
But Nie Chi, you know,

303
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,250
when you got good grades,

304
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,360
I was happier than you.

305
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:58,840
When your parents agreed you to stay

306
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,970
and go further with us,

307
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:03,530
I was much happier than you.

308
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,210
When you can't overtake others,

309
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,800
I was even more anxious than you in my heart.

310
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,730
I thought

311
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,970
I could exchange it for sincerity.

312
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:14,450
But now the truth tells me

313
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,320
that it's just my wishful thinking.

314
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:20,050
Only I am that fool, you know?

315
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,400
So why did you come back from Beijing?

316
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:23,970
You came back to take Lin Ge

317
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,450
away from me, right?

318
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,320
I like Lin Ge, don't you know?

319
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,800
Do you not know that I like Lin Ge?

320
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,970
Fang Chao, I have never thought

321
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:34,810
that you liked her.

322
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,560
If you're not happy right now,

323
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,080
then just hit me.

324
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,970
Hit me until you feel comfortable.

325
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:42,400
Aren't you a real man?

326
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,240

Go home.

330
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,120
Go home and eat dumplings.

- Start it over.
- It is not good.

341
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,690
There are more disappointments in life.

342
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:20,080
You can't take everything to heart.

343
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,050
Next time you go home,

344
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,010
you must bring both of them back.

347
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,010
I'm so exhausted.

348
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,050
I'm exhausted.

349
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,370
Let's go.

350
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:50,290
Have you heard

351
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:52,880
that we add the mixed team relay?

352
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,970
This is our new opportunity to win gold.

353
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,250
I wonder how the coach will form the teams.

354
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,770
Who will be in Tier 1?

355
00:20:58,770 --> 00:20:59,840
Do you still need to ask?

356
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:03,210
That guy, and Wei, no doubt.

357
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,730
A girl pushes a boy.

358
00:21:06,730 --> 00:21:07,930
How much strength does that take?

359
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,530
We have to train strength even more, huh?

360
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:13,560
The coach will consider the weight factor.

361
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,450
The weight difference between the two players

362
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,920
in a regular relay cannot be too large.

363
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,160
It's doomed.

364
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,880
Then whoever pushes me

365
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,360
has to bounce themselves out.

366
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:37,400

367
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:40,080

368
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:43,010
Pull yourselves together and stay focused.

369
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:46,450
Today, I'd like to introduce a new teammate.

370
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,160
Zhu Zhu from the Jiangnan Team.

371
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,500

372
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:53,050
(I have been able to understand)

373
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,450

376
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,010
(I'm also the same.)

377
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,450
(But if what I face is a genius)

378
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,290
(and the team honor,)

379
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,530
(I'm happy to)

380
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,120
(be the happy rabbit who escorts her)

381
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,600
(to the finish line.)

382
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,320
How is the recovery after bursitis surgery?

383
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,440
Not bad.

384
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:19,770
My Grand Prix results

385
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,320
can prove that I wasn't bragging.

386
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:23,770
I know a little about the matter

387
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,930
between you and Lin Ge.

388
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:27,770
How about this?

389
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,250
I need you to hold on at least this season.

390
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:32,690
You want to compete

391
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,080
and I can give you this opportunity.

392
00:22:34,490 --> 00:22:36,080
As for whether you can seize this opportunity

393
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,160
and continue to stay here,

394
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,010
it still depends on yourself.

395
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,480
Thank you, Mr. Li.

396
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:41,930
I will seize the opportunity well.

397
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,090
Let's go eat.

398
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,770
This flight delay is just too much.

399
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,640
Wei, I'm too tired.

400
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,050
You go to bed early too.

401
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,330
Wei.

402
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,400
Wei.

403
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:26,690
Lin Ge, it hurts badly.

404
00:23:29,490 --> 00:23:30,400
The disinfection is done.

405
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,930
We can only wait for it to recover.

406
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,930
She has a relay tomorrow.

407
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,640
I advise against letting her compete.

408
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,290
And we can't give her painkillers.

409
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,690
Not let her compete?

410
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,800
How did you get burnt like this?

411
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,530
I just wanted to use a hot compress

412
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,290
and I didn't hold the kettle steadily.

413
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,530
It spilled in an instant.

414
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,490
Take a good rest.

415
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,050
I...

416
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:53,250
The relay thing,

417
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,400
wait for Mr. Li to arrange it tomorrow.

418
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,880
Why didn't you take care of Xie Lingwei?

419
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,720
I was too tired. I fell asleep.

420
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,490
I mentioned it to you guys before.

421
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,360
Be extra cautious before the competition.

422
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,210
But her foot got burnt like this.

423
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,250
How can she compete now?

424
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:26,550
Manager, am I a nanny?

425
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,530
I'm also here to compete.

426
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,490
Xie Lingwei has poor self-care abilities.

427
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:32,430
How long does it take you to boil water?

428
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,450
Is it my fault?

429
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,970
Do I have to keep an eye

430
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:36,970
on her 24 hours a day?

431
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,640
Don't have a fit.

432
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,840
I don't.

433
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,080
If I don't say it,

434
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,280
you may just pretend you didn't see it.

435
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,290
If I say it, you'll think I'm having a fit.

436
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,600
The result is either I am not being sensible

437
00:24:48,690 --> 00:24:51,160
or I have to become the second Shan, right?

438
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,600
Don't put it so extreme.

439
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,530
Xie Lingwei is a good friend of yours.

440
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,800
This is just teammates helping each other.

441
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:59,160
It's true that I am friends with Wei.

442
00:24:59,450 --> 00:25:00,930
I am willing to take care of her myself.

443
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,080
This is one matter.

444
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,880
If everyone assumes

445
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:05,320
that I have to take care of her,

446
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,880
then that's another matter.

447
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,880
The first one is feelings.

448
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,290
The second one

449
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:12,530
is bullying.

450
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,970
Has everyone known about it now?

451
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,600
No.

452
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:30,320
It's just you, Xie Lingwei

453
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,640
Zhu Zhu, who is going to compete tomorrow,

454
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,480
and me.

455
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:36,640
I argued with the manager.

456
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,110
Do you think I will get punished?

457
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:40,760
Why? Are you regretting it?

458
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:43,770
Scared?

459
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,210
I'm a little scared but I don't regret it.

460
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,360
They were bullying me from the beginning.

461
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,250
Who are they?

462
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,450
Those who arranged for me to be a nanny.

463
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:01,730
Xie Lingwei annoys you every day.

464
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,290
You don't seem to be angry

465
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,770
and even call her Wei kindly every day.

466
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:06,050
It's about the matter, not the person.

467
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,640
Wei has poor self-care abilities.

468
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,740
She didn't intentionally boss me around.

469
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,490
It's someone else's fault.

470
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,120
This is the main reason why you feel wronged.

471
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:19,440
You try

472
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:23,120
to learn from Gao Kai and me.

473
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,530
This isn't good, is it?

474
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,320
What's wrong with that?

475
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,770
If you have to say it, then say it.

476
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:30,490
At least you feel comfortable, don't you?

477
00:26:31,450 --> 00:26:33,880
Thank you, Jinting. I feel much better.

478
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,160
Ordinary people like us shouldn't be led

479
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:40,080
by the nose by geniuses.

480
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:44,160
I think your anger was completely justified.

481
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:46,400
At least when they manage you later,

482
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:47,690
they should think about it.

483
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
And there are so many competitions.

484
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:52,730
These geniuses can't take all of them, huh?

485
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,250
Jinting, you're so insightful.

486
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,880
How could you be an ordinary person?

487
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:01,120
I am

488
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,800
an ordinary person.

489
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,640
All right, stop thinking so much.

490
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,690
Go to bed early.

491
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:10,610
I'm off.

492
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,010
It's fine. I have handled it.

493
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:25,530
Let's go. It's fine.

494
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,490
It's the last lap of the relay

495
00:27:29,490 --> 00:27:31,120
for the World Tour Shanghai Station.

496
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,120
Lin Ge, sprint!

497
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,730
Lin Ge, the rhythm.

498
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,100
(Post-match Press Conference)

499
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,160
Hello, Gao Kai,

500
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:39,120
can you give us your comments on this match?

501
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:43,290
This is a match where new and old players

502
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,490
help each other.

503
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,600
Regarding the match results,

504
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,730
the team is generally satisfied.

505
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,560
Thank you, Gao Kai.

506
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:50,290
Wei,

507
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,360
we have watched your matches

508
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:52,730
several times before.

509
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:53,970
Before today's match,

510
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,160
we heard that you missed the relay race

511
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:57,360
due to an accidental injury.

512
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,600
Can you tell us about the specifics?

513
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,250
I accidentally burned my foot yesterday.

514
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,450
The coach is worried that if I take the lead,

515
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:06,970
it will affect the match greatly.

516
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,160
That's why I was replaced.

517
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:10,250
But Lin Ge is already prepared,

518
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,400
so the team's results were not affected.

519
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,080
It's rare to have such a world competition.

520
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,120
Will there be regrets if you miss it?

521
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,210
A little bit.

522
00:28:20,770 --> 00:28:21,770
Ok, thank you.

523
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,450
May I ask you something, Lin Ge?

524
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:25,560
This is your first competition gold medal.

525
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,570
Do you think it's because of luck?

526
00:28:33,690 --> 00:28:35,050
All the athletes in the competition

527
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,970
are capable of contending for medals.

528
00:28:39,930 --> 00:28:42,250
Each of us relies on strength,

529
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,360
not luck.

- Post it when we get back.
- Ok.

Congrats, bye.

536
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,240
Gao Kai,

537
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,160
what Wei said is not inappropriate, isn't it?

538
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,050
I'm not sure

539
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,870
if someone will interpret it maliciously.

540
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,640
Will they?

541
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,010
Whether Xie Lingwei said it or not,

542
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:19,930
Lin Ge suddenly took her place in the relay,

543
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:21,590
people who follow her will have speculations.

544
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,640
There will be conspiracy theories.

Her words

546

Mr. Gao, look here.

Thank you.

Lower.

00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,800
It's done.

561
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,290
- Let me see.
- You take a look.

562
00:30:09,050 --> 00:30:09,890
Let me see.

563
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,130
Oh my!

564
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,530
Oh my, what is this?

565
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,250
I still need to post on my Moments.

566
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,400
How should I write it then?

567
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,490
Only my head is there.

568
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:19,080
Did I just come out of the land?

569
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,450
You asked me to include the entire banner.

570
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,970
If so, the person will definitely be small.

571
00:30:22,970 --> 00:30:24,800
All right, it's ok to include the text.

572
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,800
Give me a like on Moments.

573
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,730
You're showing off every day.

574
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,490
How is Fang Chao doing in the national team?

575
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:34,840
It's good for him to be able to compete.

576
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,840
It's just so-so.

577
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,490
How about having a drink at my place?

578
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:38,640
Forget it.

579
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,080
I'm afraid your wife will hit me.

580
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:41,640
I'm leaving now.

581
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,600
All right, let's drink another day.

582
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:49,020
(National Ice Sports Base)

583
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,730
Look at this Daniel.

584
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,160
He was in the lead the whole time.

585
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,290
No one can overtake him.

586
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,490
Indeed, he's too impressive.

587
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:05,600
If he goes faster next time,

588
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,120
I can't even see his shadow.

589
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,450
He is an experienced veteran.

590
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,120
He has much more experience than we do.

591
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,540
(Dad)

592
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:13,370
Who?

593
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,480
My dad.

594
00:31:15,730 --> 00:31:16,580
Quick, put it on speaker.

595
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:17,730
(Dad)
I also want to talk to Master.

596
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:19,600
Hello? Dad.

597
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:22,050
My precious son,

598
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,840
are you tired after a day of flying?

599
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,970
You must have dialed the wrong number.

600
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,050
Is this my dad?

601
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,050
What are you talking about?

602
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,840
Come back and let me kick your ass.

603
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:34,800
The you'll know whether I am your dad.

604
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,640
Come.

605
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,840
It's my dad.

606
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,400
Be serious.

607
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,320
If you talk like this,

608
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,560
I will definitely know it's you.

609
00:31:40,730 --> 00:31:42,290
What's wrong with you?

610
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:43,640
Today is not a day off either.

611
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,800
Why do you call me?

612
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,800
Is something wrong at home?

613
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,080
No, what could happen to us?

614
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:52,010
Son, have you returned to your dorm?

615
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:54,360
Don't just stay alone in the dorm.

616
00:31:54,530 --> 00:31:55,770
Go talk to your teammates.

617
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,730
Otherwise, chat with me or your dad.

618
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,160
I'm not alone here.

619
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,530
Mrs. Fang, we're all here.

620
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:05,930
Nie Chi, Seven Gold and I.

621
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,560
Fine, you go ahead.

622
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,770
Well,

623
00:32:09,770 --> 00:32:12,320
we'll call Fang Chao again on the weekend.

624
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,770
I haven't finished speaking yet.

625
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,080
I didn't even say anything.

626
00:32:17,530 --> 00:32:18,840
I haven't introduced myself yet.

627
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,880
What's wrong with them today?

628
00:32:23,210 --> 00:32:25,530
See? I said he's fine, right?

629
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,640
Then why did you call him?

630
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,730
It's not me.

631
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:29,970
You said

632
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,280
Nie Chi and Lin Ge both have medals

633
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:33,450
and they are still in a relationship.

634
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:35,530
You're worried our son will feel lost.

635
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,210
Enough. Stop arguing now.

636
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,730
I am not arguing.

637
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,290
Honey,

638
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:44,160
no vegetables left. Go buy some greens.

639
00:32:45,970 --> 00:32:46,970
Fine.

640
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:54,640
Just study well.

641
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:56,530
You have no idea how much effort I put in

642
00:32:56,530 --> 00:32:57,880
to arrange this for you.

643
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,160
You give up so easily.

644
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,490
Where can you

645
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,450
find a job without a diploma now?

646
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,640
How could you watch over this shop

647
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:08,210
every day like me?

648
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:11,080
Don't arrange anything for me, ok?

649
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,840
Even if you arrange it, I won't listen.

650
00:33:14,690 --> 00:33:16,160
Auntie.

651
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,490
Auntie.

652
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:18,770
What's going on?

653
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:21,400
Lin Ge has won a gold medal.

654
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:22,720
What gold medal?

655
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,010
It seems to be an international competition.

656
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,490
The coach even hung a banner.

657
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:29,730
She must win quite a lot of prize money.

658
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:30,930
Of course.

659
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,530
I think

660
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,290
you were too unkind to her back then.

661
00:33:36,930 --> 00:33:38,400
If she had been well cared for by your side,

662
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:40,800
maybe she could help Feng now.

663
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,240
Back then, if it weren't for me,

664
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,770
how would she be where she is today?

665
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,970
I need to ask Mr. Fang

666
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:47,010
and see how much

667
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,050
a world champion can get.

668
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:50,490
What are you doing?

669
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,210
What does her money have to do with us?

670
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,010
If you can, then don't spend my money.

671
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:58,120
You neither go to school

672
00:33:58,450 --> 00:33:59,800
nor make money.

673
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:04,050
I work so hard to save some money.

674
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,210
For whom?

675
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,080
