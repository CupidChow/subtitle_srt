After the physical tests, did you

27
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,170
feel the harshness of the national team?

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,250
I can only

29
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,970
keep a maximum of a quarter among you.

30
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:43,280
Welcome to the national team.

31
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
Don't think about anything.

32
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:47,250
Just imitate our old rival Yang Xiaofei.

33
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,480
What does it feel like

34
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:51,890
to lead Wei slide?

35
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:53,690
You are dazzled by the halo

36
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,610
of the genius today, huh?

37
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,280
Nie Chi and Xie Lingwei

38
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,760
really look like a couple.

39
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,640
It feels strange

40
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,400
to see you training with her.

41
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:10,460
=Episode 9=
=Who Do You Want to Do Trivial Things With?=

42
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:12,690
By the way, Shan,

43
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,920
I have another question.

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,050
Has Wei ever been in a relationship?

45
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,610
What kind of boy does she like?

46
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:25,280
Who are you helping? Nie Chi?

47
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,890
Do you think she matches well with Nie Chi?

48
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,760
Nie Chi looks ok.

49
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,730
The conditions at home are also pretty good.

50
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,010
But his personality is really poor.

51
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,570
He has a long face every day.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,480
Wei can't suffer this injustice.

53
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,450
Nie Chi isn't that bad, right?

54
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,730
It's quite easy to get along with him.

55
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,640
What do you mean?

56
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:46,360
You want to fix them up, don't you?

57
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,310
How could it be possible?

58
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:50,410
I'm just chatting casually.

59
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,200
I think

60
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,410
there's no suitable boy in the team.

61
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,010
At the present stage,

62
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,960
no, for a long time,

63
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,120
she's not suitable for dating.

64
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,850
Shan, you really care about Wei.

65
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:10,570
Lin Ge, I am done with my work.

66
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,600
What do you want from me?

67
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,600
Coming.

68
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,890
Look at Yang Xiaofei.

69
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,330
Her strength lies in her fast starting speed

70
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,520
and strong explosive power.

71
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:23,730
Every time she takes off,

72
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,060
she can always seize the first position.

73
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,620
She also has another characteristic.

74
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,890
Her route control

75
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,290
and race strategy are excellent.

76
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,080
She is always able to maintain first place.

77
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,050
She has so many characteristics, huh?

78
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,600
I thought she is just strong.

79
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,640
So when I trained,

80
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,610
I added weight and more food crazily.

81
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,410
What do you mean by more food?

82
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:41,890
It means eating more than before.

83
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,480
Oh my!

84
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,450
See how low her body fat rate is.

85
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,760
Steamed buns that you eat are all carbs.

86
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,760
What's the use of not building muscle?

87
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,610
Weigh yourself and see if you've gained.

88
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:56,680
Weight myself right now?

89
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,170
No need for that.

90
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:00,960
Face the reality.

91
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,050
- I... I...
- Hurry up, hurry up!

92
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:03,860
- I won't grow much.
- Hurry up.

93
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,710
Go ahead.

94
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,890
I don't have to, right?

95
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,960
Hurry up.

96
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,360
I'll go by myself.

97
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:09,320
You mustn't peek.

98
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,290
We won't. Just go.

99
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,330
We won't.

100
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:16,600
We won't peek.

101
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,470
Don't peek.

102
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,320
We won't peek.

103
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:41,880
Oh my! I've gained about six pounds.

104
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,480
Lin Ge, how is your weight loss going?

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,630
- I lost five pounds.
- Quick.

106
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:52,000
Impressive! You lost weight quite fast.

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:52,960
Of course.

108
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,800
You don't know

109
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:55,850
I feel dizzy from hunger every day.

110
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,170
Everyone, listen to me.

111
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,290
There's a competition recently.

112
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,970
Huarong Cup Invitational Tournament.

113
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,320
It's organized by the country

114
00:05:14,410 --> 00:05:15,530
to promote ice and snow sports.

115
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,880
This year is the first one without points.

116
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:20,440
So I made the adjustments

117
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,650
for the list of participants.

118
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,050
Now I will announce the list.

119
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,570
Nie Chi.

120
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,080
Fang Chao.

121
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:34,860
Jin Xinxin.

122
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,260
Gao Kai.

123
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,380
Chen Mingyuan.

124
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,900
Xie Lingwei.

125
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,860
Lin Ge.

126
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,340
Chao Jinting.

127
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,180
I don't say much about the veteran players.

128
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,740
I'll focus on new players this time.

129
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,420
I hope everyone

130
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,180
can find your goals

131
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,060
through this competition

132
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,260
and let me see your team spirit.

133
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,540
Understand?

134
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:18,560
Understood.

135
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,420
Let's go.

136
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,300
What is my goal?

137
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,420
Stop overthinking.

138
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:26,740
- You know what I'm thinking?
- Hungry, huh?

139
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,860
Lin Ge, do you have anything to eat?

140
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,620
I have chocolate and eggs.

141
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,620
I'm exhausted.

142
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,740
My bones feel like they're falling apart.

143
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,260
I hope everyone

144
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,020
can find your goals

145
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,740
through this competition.

146
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,380
Goal?

147
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:05,500
What can my goal be?

148
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,060
Can I say I want to achieve a good ranking?

149
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,380
If an athlete doesn't want that,

150
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,140
what's the point of being an athlete?

151
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,940
What's wrong?

152
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,380
What happened?

153
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,380
I want to boil some water.

154
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,140
Why is there water everywhere?

155
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,940
Next time, just leave it there.

156
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,620
Don't move, let me do it.

157
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,660
Ok?

158
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,500
Why are you in the hallway?

159
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:14,020
Aren't you also here?

160
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,820
I'm helping Gao Kai fetch the camera

161
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,180
to check some data.

162
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,140
Right.

163
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,380
You're sharing a room with Gao Kai.

164
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,060
You're so tired.

165
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,380
Why not go back to the room and lie down?

166
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,460
I feel more tired in the room.

167
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,620
In such a short hour,

168
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,660
I helped Wei change bedding,

169
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:40,740
cleaned the toilet and the sink,

170
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,260
and also found the medicine box

171
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,560
in the small corner of her suitcase.

172
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:46,860
I also asked the front desk for something.

173
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:50,740
Looking after her isn't the most tiring part.

174
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:54,500
The main issue is that I don't know

175
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,980
how to complete the task

176
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,260
assigned by Mr. Li.

177
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,220
Task?

178
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:01,180
What task?

179
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,260
The competition goal he asked about.

180
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,620
I don't know what my goal is.

181
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:08,780
Goal...

182
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:12,900
By the way, I have something to tell you.

183
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,260
In this competition, you will encounter

184
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:19,020
Yang Xiaofei, whom you've been studying.

185
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,460
She is coming too?

186
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,260
So I think your goal for this competition

187
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,020
should be to confront her directly

188
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:26,980
and give her some trouble.

189
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,140
I...

190
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:30,340
Can I do it?

191
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,860
You stay here for now.

192
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,380
I'll go get the camera first.

193
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,740
After checking the data, I'll come to you.

194
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:38,580
All right.

195
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,860
Forget it, I won't think about it for now.

196
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,380
Competition goal...

197
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,380
During this time, don't think about anything.

198
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,900
Just imitate our old rival Yang Xiaofei.

199
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:57,390
After studying her thoroughly,

200
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,140
you can come to the women's team
as a training partner.

201
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,380
Lin Ge.

202
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,020
Lin Ge.

203
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,380
Wei.

204
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:52,620
Lin Ge, I want to sleep now.

205
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,140
But I dare not turn off the lights alone.

206
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,660
Ok, let's go back now.

207
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,100
Let's go.

208
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:01,500
Time to sleep. We're going now.

209
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,220
Hello, everyone.

210
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,140
Welcome to the site

211
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,260
of Huarong Cup Invitational Tournament.

212
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,140
Today we will witness together

213
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,340
men's and women's 1500m.

214
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,900
Lin Ge, I'm a bit thirsty.

215
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,020
I want to drink water.

216
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,460
Ok, there is a water dispenser here.

217
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:23,460
I'll see if I can find any disposable cups.

218
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,100
Here.

219
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,460
It's hot.

220
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:34,580
Hot?

221
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,020
Then I'll get you some cold water.

222
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,540
Are you ok?

223
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,100
I'm fine.

224
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,260
What do you mean? You also like Wei?

225
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,860
No.

226
00:12:52,870 --> 00:12:54,380
Why are you so attentive to Wei?

227
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,020
When am I attentive to her?

228
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,260
In front of me.

229
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,140
Just now.

230
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,860
I am just concerned about my teammate.

231
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,450
Since you care so much,

232
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,140
this arduous yet glorious task

233
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,260
will be entrusted to you.

234
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,180
You're really thoughtful.

235
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,860
Feeling much better.

236
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,100
Ok.

237
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,100
You also need fresh air?

238
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,860
I need a quiet atmosphere.

239
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:42,860
Gao Kai talks too much,

240
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:45,380
always finding something to say. I'm tired.

241
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,380
How about we switch rooms?

242
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,340
Switch rooms?

243
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,640
You want to share a room with Gao Kai?

244
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,020
Go away.

245
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,460
I am thinking of you.

246
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,860
I find you like to take care of Wei.

247
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,500
I just do you a favor.

248
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,860
I come here to explain it to you.

249
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,900
I saw you were too tired yesterday.

250
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:08,140
I want to share some of your burdens.

251
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,100
Really?

252
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,300
What else?

253
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,740
I don't need it.

254
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,190
Prepare well for the competition.

255
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,660
Don't you need to get prepared?

256
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,740
A person's energy is limited.

257
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,100
You're not Xiao Shanshan

258
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,860
who just needs to take care of Xie Lingwei

259
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:25,860
like a nanny.

260
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,180
She doesn't need grades.

261
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:31,740
Seeing you were busy with taking care of her

262
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,620
made me more annoyed.

263
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,900
I have already handed this task

264
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:45,950
over to Seven Gold.

265
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,020
Is this ok?

266
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,540
Yeah, Seven Gold.

267
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,220
How could I not have thought of that?

268
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:55,260
Then you won't be annoyed, will you?

269
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,500
Seven Gold likes Wei.

270
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,500
Doing trivial things with a girl he likes

271
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,740
must make him very happy.

272
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,020
What about you?

273
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,740
Who do you want to do such things with?

274
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,000
We will compete tomorrow.

275
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,400
I'm already nervous as hell.

276
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,040
Yet you still talk about such trivial things.

277
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,460
Hurry back to your room.

278
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,140
I need to calm down my emotions.

279
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,220
Otherwise, if I encounter

280
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,540
Yang Xiaofei tomorrow,

281
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,460
I will definitely be crushed by her.

282
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,860
It's not a big deal.

283
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,220
Why?

284
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,740
Because you already know her very well now.

285
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,740
But she knows nothing about you.

286
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:34,190
Really?

287
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,020
When have I ever lied to you?

288
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,020
Get some rest early.

289
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:50,140
Go, Team China!

290
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:56,230
Go, Team China!

291
00:15:56,350 --> 00:16:00,290
Go, Team China!

292
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:03,340
Xie Lingwei, Lin Ge, and Nie Chi

293
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:04,620
have made it into Final A.

294
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,760
Very good.

295
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,860
- Awesome!
- Fang Chao, Jin Xinxin.

296
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:12,740
Continue to practice after going back.

297
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,860
For now, just be cheerleaders.

298
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,980
Lin Ge, Xie Lingwei,

299
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,940
come here.

300
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,260
Let me tell you about Yang Xiaofei.

301
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,260
Hurry up.

302
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:36,860
(Huarong Cup Invitational Tournament)

303
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,370
After setting off,

304
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,020
Xie Lingwei has maintained the first place.

305
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,440
Yang Xiaofei is in second place

306
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,260
and Lin Ge is currently in third place.

307
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,380
Yang Xiaofei is our main competitor.

308
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,220
Let's see their performance in the curves.

309
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,860
Lin Ge suddenly overtook.

310
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,580
Yang Xiaofei clearly focused all her attention

311
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,020
on Xie Lingwei in front of her.

312
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:54,260
She didn't expect Lin Ge to charge out,

313
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,620
with such strong power

314
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,260
and strong overtaking in the curve.

315
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,220
Chinese players are in the top two positions.

316
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,100
As long as they maintain this lead,

317
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,900
this competition couldn't be more perfect.

318
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,060
The final curve.

319
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,740
Yang Xiaofei is very close.

320
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
Lin Ge fell down.

321
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,780
An accident happened.

322
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,690
Lin Ge has fallen off the track

323
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,220
and crashed into the barrier.

324
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,260
We can only watch Xie Lingwei's performance.

325
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,040
She sprinted across the line for first place.

326
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,300
Team China held onto the gold medal.

327
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,260
But Lin Ge is too regrettable.

328
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:24,740
As a rookie in Team China,

329
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:27,100
she originally had the chance to be better.

330
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,180
The audience sighed in disappointment.

331
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,460
An accident occurred just now.

332
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,180
Is there a possibility of a foul?

333
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,460
The referees are reviewing the video.

334
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,020
Will the result change?

335
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,820
What's the result?

336
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:46,540
The referees found no issues.

337
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:49,540
She clearly pressed on her knee.

338
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,540
Don't explain it anymore.

339
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,300
This signature has been confirmed.

340
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:53,780
I don't watch this signature.

341
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,180
- I want to watch the replay.
- Appeal invalid.

342
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,540
Why is it invalid?

343
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,500
The referees repeatedly watched the video.

344
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,980
The final decision is

345
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,940
there is no foul and the score is valid.

346
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,100
Congratulations to Xie Lingwei.

347
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,420
Lin Ge, do your best next time.

348
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,420
Mr. Li.

349
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,020
Appeal invalid.

350
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,100
Xie Lingwei is first place.

351
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,740
Yang Xiaofei is not penalized.

352
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:12,260
When she pressed your knee,

353
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,300
your bodies were overlapping each other.

354
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,140
That position

355
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,660
was in the referee's blind spot.

356
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,180
The camera didn't catch it either.

357
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,300
But Mr. Li,

358
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,450
when she was close to me,

359
00:18:20,450 --> 00:18:21,870
I suddenly slowed down and fell out.

360
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,740
Isn't this obvious she did harm to me?

361
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:25,100
But we have no evidence.

362
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,260
Appealing is useless.

363
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,100
It's not fair.

364
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,340
Let me tell you,

365
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,580
there is no absolute fairness,

366
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,940
only absolute strength.

367
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,980
It's the cruelty of short track speed skating.

368
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:39,980
Understand?

369
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,100
The men's 500-meter finals

370
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:09,260
has entered the final half of the sprint.

371
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,020
Nie Chi from Team China

372
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,820
currently ranks second in the competition.

373
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:13,660
In front of them...

374
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:16,260
Nie Chi, find an opportunity from inside.

375
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,180
- Overtake.
- Go for it!

376
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,940
It's not only about speed but mindset.

377
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,980
An opportunity appears.

378
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,660
Nie Chi has the ability to advance further.

379
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,740
Before entering the straight,

380
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,740
Wu Dingwen left an opening.

381
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,300
A fleeting opportunity.

382
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,980
Nie Chi seems to have missed it.

383
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,060
Why not overtake him?

384
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,740
The race is entering its final stage.

385
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,140
Nie Chi should still have some strength left.

386
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,780
- Last lap, last lap.
- Come on.

387
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:40,300
Does Nie Chi still have a chance?

388
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,300
Full speed ahead!

389
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,660
Sprint phase.

390
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,500
The competitors behind have caught up.

391
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,820
Could he be in last place?

392
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,460
What a pity!

393
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:17,420
All right. That's enough for the analysis.

394
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,460
What are your thoughts?

395
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,820
Go ahead and say it.

396
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,060
Mr. Li,

397
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,020
I'm sorry.

398
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,060
It's ok.

399
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,590
It's your first international competition.

400
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,540
This is very normal.

401
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,540
Once the program in your mind is written,

402
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,740
it can't be changed, right?

403
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,340
Everyone, listen carefully.

404
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:50,500
Be flexible and play it by ear.

405
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,100
I'm sorry.

406
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,340
Mr. Li,

407
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,500
I will gather

408
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,020
more thoughts and report them to you.

409
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:00,910
Reporters are waiting in the media area.

410
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:03,260
Let's leave it for now.

411
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:11,780
Let's go.

412
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,020
What does that sentence from Mr. Li mean?

413
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,660
How would I know what it means?

414
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,940
I didn't understand it at all.

415
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,580
Want some?

416
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,500
I don't eat.

417
00:21:58,500 --> 00:21:59,820
Lin Ge, Lin Ge,

418
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,500
I don't think that he has any issues.

419
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,740
He's already the best

420
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,100
among us.

421
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:08,740
The worst case would be

422
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,500
like me and Seven Gold

423
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,300
getting scolded by the coach.

424
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,580
It's ok.

425
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,180
Look at his soul-lost expression.

426
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,100
You think everything is ok?

427
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:18,940
Isn't it?

428
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,340
How do you see that?

429
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,060
Isn't being stunned his normal state?

430
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,940
I have never seen him eat dragon fruit.

431
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,420
You think it's ok?

432
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,500
Did he not eat it before?

433
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:38,740
I'm really fine.

434
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,400
Let's talk about it when we get back.

435
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,820
When we get back?

436
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,620
You didn't say anything just now in the car.

437
00:22:43,630 --> 00:22:44,760
Now you don't say anything either.

438
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,460
Let's find a place with no one around. Go.

439
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:50,580
Lin Ge.

440
00:22:52,460 --> 00:22:53,300
Wait for me.

441
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,620
Fang Chao.

442
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,580
What's wrong with them?

443
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,860
I don't know.

444
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,940
You have to work harder.

445
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,260
It's a movie of three people.

446
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,500
You are about to be eliminated.

447
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,660
You talk too much.

448
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:10,020
Say it here. No room for negotiation.

449
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,740
Don't you even trust me anymore?

450
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,460
You just hesitated during the competition.

451
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:21,100
Correct it next time.

452
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:25,980
Mr. Li is different from Ms. Han.

453
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:28,100
He loves to speak in a sarcastic tone.

454
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:30,100
Can't you see that?

455
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,740
Don't take it to heart.

456
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,660
Don't poke me, or I'll become foolish.

457
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:42,420
My issue can't be easily fixed.

458
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:43,780
Domestic competitors

459
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:45,020
are always those people.

460
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,260
I have already studied them thoroughly.

461
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:49,500
Plus the advantage in speed,

462
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,420
I definitely can't fall behind.

463
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,700
But this competition is different.

464
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:56,180
The opponents I face are all strangers.

465
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:58,700
I won't overtake them if I'm not confident.

466
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
I was afraid of collisions and injuries.

467
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,100
What Mr. Li said is correct.

468
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,250
The core program in my brain is stuck.

469
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,700
If this continues,

470
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:13,780
the problem will only get worse.

471
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,260
I might not even be able to compete.

472
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,580
It's not that serious.

473
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:25,060
Lin Ge, you know me well.

474
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,060
Not only on the rink,

475
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,420
also in life, I hate the unknown.

476
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,540
If I feel that I can't control it,

477
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,420
I easily become stagnant.

478
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,660
I was always in the lead in the past.

479
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:52,220
I can't feel how precious

480
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,940
the courage to catch up is.

481
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,740
At that time, I was still mocking them

482
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,780
for being reckless and not thinking.

483
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,900
Actually,

484
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,500
I am the most cowardly person.

485
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:30,300
(So,)

486
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,660
(an issue could be life-threatening.)

487
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,020
(Who would have thought)

488
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,460
(Nie Chi has the most serious problems)

489
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,740
(among the three of us?)

490
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,260
(If delaying gratification)

491
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:44,540
(means lingering in the process of delay,)

492
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:48,020
(how is that different from avoidance?)

493
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,460
(I can't answer this cruel question)

494
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:52,260
(for Nie Chi.)

495
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:53,340
(But I know)

496
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,900
(if he is not around to share the joy,)

497
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:00,700
(our promise will lose half of its meaning.)

498
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,780
Don't think about it.

499
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,580
Everything will be ok.

500
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,220
Chao, I will go bring some food to Wei.

501
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:52,940
If you don't sleep, I won't take the card.

502
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,500
Seven Gold.

503
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,780
Can I ask you something?

504
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,220
What's that?

505
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,700
How did you know

506
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,540
that you like Xie Lingwei?

507
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,580
Who says I like...

508
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,260
Well, how do you know...

509
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,300
I don't like her.

510
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:12,580
Who said I like her?

511
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,820
Isn't this something the whole team knows?

512
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:18,100
The whole team knows it?

513
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,660
Maybe only Xie Lingwei doesn't know.

514
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,540
She only knows how to skate.

515
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,700
That's fine.

516
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,740
Are you

517
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,740
sighing in relief or just sighing?

518
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:39,900
I'm a bit scared to let her know.

519
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,420
If she knows it,

520
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:43,220
maybe she won't play with me anymore.

521
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,500
So you like her

522
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,340
and want to hang out with her?

523
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,020
Liking someone

524
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,100
means wanting to be with her, right?

525
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,340
Yeah.

526
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,500
Liking someone is to keep her in your heart.

527
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,260
When I see something delicious food or fun,

528
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,220
I think of her.

529
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:02,700
I feel happy when I see her.

530
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,420
I just want to play with her.

531
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,860
Moreover,

532
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:08,900
I hope she only wants to play with me.

533
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,740
I only want to play with her.

534
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:11,960
I don't want to play with others.

535
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,500
I see you're not sleepy.

536
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
I won't take the room card then.

537
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,740
Open the door in a moment.

538
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,260
Ok.

539
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:35,220
Do I like Lin Ge?

540
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:46,940
(National Ice Sports Base)

541
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,340
Nie Chi,

542
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,540
I want to ask you something.

543
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,380
Go ahead.

544
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:04,300
At that time in the restaurant,

545
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,460
why did Lin Ge take you to the garden?

546
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,340
I lost the competition

547
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,660
and she wanted to comfort me.

548
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:16,980
So what do you think?

549
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,700
I have an issue with my mindset.

550
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:25,180
I'm not asking you about the competition.

551
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:26,420
I am asking you...

552
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,060
Wait a second.

553
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,540
Hello? Mr. Li.

554
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,580
Can I come over now?

555
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:43,220
All right. Goodbye, Mr. Li.

556
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,740
Is Mr. Li looking for you?

557
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,500
All right then, I won't ask for now.

558
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,740
Let's talk about it next time.

559
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,220
Do you have any dirty clothes to wash?

560
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:56,060
Take them out. I'll wash them together.

561
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,180
No need.

562
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:03,020
Maybe Mr. Li will give me a train ticket.

563
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,060
I don't even need to open this suitcase.

564
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,900
What train ticket?

565
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,580
What does it mean?

566
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,340
From mindset to techniques,

567
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,060
your analysis is very insightful.

568
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,740
From this perspective,

569
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,740
Nie Chi, you are really smart.

570
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,780
But now

571
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,100
I want to tell you something more important.

572
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,740
The national team never nurtures idlers.

573
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,020
Does it sound particularly harsh?

574
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,520
You think I am too heartless, right?

575
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,340
The national team never nurtures idlers,

576
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,700
not only for itself

577
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,260
but also for yourselves.

578
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,580
Think about it.

579
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,380
What are your peers doing now?

580
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,700
Some are preparing for NCEE.

581
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:55,100
Some have already entered university.

582
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,260
I know your family is well off.

583
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,460
But time is fair

584
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,500
for everyone, right?

585
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:03,500
If you don't want to compete,

586
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,780
then it's better to go study.

587
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:07,170
That way, your family can help you.

588
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:08,900
- Mr. Li...
- And...

589
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,300
Do you know how fierce

590
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,420
the competition is for each province

591
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,900
to enter the national team every year?

592
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,940
The leaders in your province

593
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,420
and your coach have chosen you,

594
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,260
holding great expectations for you.

595
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:21,820
You need to learn to cherish.

596
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,820
From the city team until now,

597
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,340
I have no doubt about your passion

598
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,740
for this sport and your abilities.

599
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,260
But in the national team,

600
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:33,900
having no results means being eliminated.

601
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,660
Lin Ge. Lin Ge.

602
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:41,060
Just now Nie Chi didn't even have time

603
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,500
to pack his luggage,

604
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,340
saying he would get a ticket from Mr. Li.

605
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,260
What does it mean?

606
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,500
How long has he been gone?

607
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,740
It's been about ten minutes.

608
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,340
I put the clothes in the washing machine

609
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,300
and then came over to find you.

610
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,180
It has been so long.

611
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:54,500
You still have time to do the laundry.

612
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,020
So stupid!

613
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,340
Lin Ge, wait for me.

614
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,180
Come back, come back.

615
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,220
What ticket? What does it mean?

616
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,780
Gao Kai mentioned it the other day.

617
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,980
Being given a ticket means being returned.

618
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:05,660
Returned... Oh no.

619
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,060
Returned?

620
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,260
Mr. Li, you talk to me this much.

621
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,500
Does it mean I don't need to get a ticket?

622
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,500
Ticket?

623
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:22,260
Gao Kai said it, right?

624
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,780
He is just messing around all day long.

625
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,740
Am I temporarily safe now?

626
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,540
Nie Chi, let me tell you,

627
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:38,300
everyone in the national team, including me,

628
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,180
is only temporarily safe.

629
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:45,420
Is he really going to leave?

630
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,020
It was not easy to make it step by step

631
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,100
from the sports school to the national team.

632
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,100
You know,

633
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,420
he is quite annoying most of the time

634
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,740
and likes to nag and makes me angry.

635
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,340
But thinking he is really going to leave,

636
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,100
I feel quite flustered.

637
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,340
What's wrong with you?

638
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:09,500
Lin Ge, Shan isn't going to leave, is she?

639
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,540
What is going on here?

640
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,180
This...

641
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:15,900
Nie Chi, are you ok?

642
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,420
I'm fine. What are you...

643
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,740
What could happen to him?

644
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,940
Is my office so dangerous?

645
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,820
Lin Ge, I'm going back with Jinting.

646
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,740
I was freaked out.

647
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,740
Fang Chao said you went to get the ticket.

648
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,260
You made a false report.

649
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,660
I didn't know what's going on either.

650
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:44,180
Mr. Li just wanted to crack the whip.

651
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,100
He wanted to criticize me a bit more.

652
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:47,900
But it was too noisy outside.

653
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,980
He couldn't take it anymore.

654
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,740
We thought you were going to leave.

655
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,820
Now Mr. Li gave you a chance.

656
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,260
Will you stay?

657
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,700
This is a mental hurdle.

658
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:05,700
I am not as confident

659
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:07,540
as when solving technical problems.

660
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,500
What do you mean?

661
00:34:10,180 --> 00:34:11,580
Do you need help?

662
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,900
As long as you can stay in the national team,

663
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,020
we'll find a way to help you solve it.

664
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,220
Just tell us what problems you have.

665
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,460
Let's go.

666
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,500
Isn't it just overtaking, bro?

667
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,980
Is it that difficult?

668
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,220
Isn't it just a matter of overtaking?

669
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,420
What are you afraid of?

670
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,940
Lin Ge just wanted to give you a high five.

671
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,500
You didn't even dare reach out your hand.

672
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,020
You are not a true man.

673
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,420
You have great talent. So what?

674
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,620
Do you want to be returned because of this?

675
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,100
Isn't it just overtaking?

676
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,980
Go to the ice rink to practice.

677
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:03,460
I'll practice with you. Come on.

678
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,620
Come on, hurry up.

679
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,580
You can't be my sparring partner.

680
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,220
