Why don't you tell me that you like Wei?

27
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:41,050
That look did represent affection.

28
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:42,400
Because I was watching you.

29
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:44,730
Lin Ge, I like you.

30
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,760
Are you confessing your love?

31
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,760
Lin Ge, I like you.

32
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,810
(Sweetie cake)
I have a lot to share with you.

33
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,200
This is what Nie Chi gave me.

34
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,090
I had a really happy birthday this year.

35
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,480
It's fine as long as you're happy.

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,840
If you're happy, I'm happy.

00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:20,960
Han Bing, here you are.

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,080
Have a seat.

41
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,330
Why are you being so polite?

42
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,080
I treat you to a meal and you bring a gift.

43
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,520
You're thinking too much.
This is for Lin Ge.

44
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,760
Help me take it back.

45
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:32,850
Is it just for Lin Ge alone?

46
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:35,130
Several of your beloved disciples are there.

47
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,240
As for the others,

48
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,550
either their family is not short of money,

49
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,360
or their parents have prepared for them.

50
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,290
They don't need me.

51
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:42,290
Anyway, you are always reasonable.

52
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:44,130
I just ordered a few dishes.

53
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,610
Order whatever you want.

54
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,080
It's ok. Let's make do with it.

55
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,410
I have to catch the train later.

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,610
I have to get back tomorrow morning.

57
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,570
In such a hurry?

58
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,200
What's the matter?
We have to meet in person?

59
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,610
Since you're catching the train,

60
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,200
I'll make it brief.

61
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:01,640
I discovered that Nie Chi and Lin Ge

62
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,550
might go the same way

63
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,130
as Yu Siyang and Chen Mingyuan.

64
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,520
Fall in love?

65
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,450
No.

66
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:08,450
But there is such a possibility.

67
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,570
Not surprised at all? You were expecting it.

68
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:20,850
There are all adolescents in the team.

69
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,360
I've seen this kind of thing more than you.

70
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,130
It's true.

71
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:28,130
You know,

72
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,920
regarding Yu Siyang and Chen Mingyuan,

73
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,610
if I was not so rigid,

74
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,330
would it be a different result?

75
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,850
Just because I was too young

76
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,050
to know how to adapt.

77
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,050
I often think about in my heart

78
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,240
if I destroyed them.

79
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,170
What do you mean?

80
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,920
If you want to learn from me, just say it.

81
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:53,960
Nie Chi and Lin Ge

82
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,640
are your beloved disciples.

83
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:57,240
Shouldn't you give me any advice?

84
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,130
You don't have to worry about anything.

85
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:02,330
Both of them know what they are doing,

86
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:03,890
especially Lin Ge.

87
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,730
Considering her family,

88
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,480
she won't lose her mind.

89
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:10,520
In my opinion,

90
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:14,800
dating may not affect the training.

91
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,650
But breaking up will definitely affect it.

92
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:19,650
So according to you,

93
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:21,970
I should wish them a happy marriage, huh?

94
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,440
Nothing has gone wrong with them.

95
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,000
Can you stop getting involved?

96
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,730
Isn't this the same as saying nothing?

97
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,050
By the way,

98
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,090
you have to pay attention to Fang Chao.

99
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,420
What's wrong with Fang Chao?

100
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,730
I think

101
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:38,650
Fang Chao also has feelings for Lin Ge.

102
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:40,400
If...

103
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:42,290
If what you said is true,

104
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,090
and Nie Chi and Lin Ge are together,

105
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:47,770
the person you should care about is Fang Chao.

106
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,000
Now that you mention it,

107
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,240
he does seem to be like that.

108
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:58,440
Why are these kids so...

109
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,800
How good and simple it was back then!

110
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,000
We only knew about training. How vigorous!

111
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,680
You're simple and stupid.

112
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
There were a lot of such things at that time.

113
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:10,560
You were so stubborn

114
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,680
that no one was willing to tell you.

115
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:14,640
Really?

116
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,410
Then tell me

117
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,970
who you were with at that time.

118
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,880
Excuse me. I'm ready to order.

119
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,410
I told you not to follow me.

120
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,480
You've been avoiding me all day.

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,730
So what?

122
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:43,170
Then you get angry?

123
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:45,560
How did I make you unhappy?

124
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,410
You can tell me.

125
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:47,610
I can change.

126
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,850
Or if you really don't like me,

127
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:50,970
you can also tell me.

128
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:52,320
I can handle it.

129
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,000
But don't let me guess what you are thinking.

130
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,610
You know I can't do it.

131
00:05:57,410 --> 00:05:58,770
I've been thinking about it all day.

132
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,210
Why on earth keeps you away from me?

133
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,090
Is it because you hate me

134
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,240
or I make you unhappy?

135
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,290
Or is it because of girl's psychology

136
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,770
mentioned online?

137
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,970
Did you check it online?

138
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,000
It's better not to check.

139
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,680
I think my thinking is a little selfish.

140
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,410
I haven't figured out how to tell you.

141
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,730
Even so, you still have to tell me.

142
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,240
If it's too much,

143
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,480
I will really criticize you.

144
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,810
How dare you!

145
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:32,770
Of course I dare.

146
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,970
What am I afraid of?

147
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,880
Every time I encountered a problem,

148
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:38,530
you showed up in time.

149
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,630
Not only it's the problem with my parents,

150
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,290
but also with Gao Kai and Huang Han,

151
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:44,570
you were all like this.

152
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,090
You are the same to me.

153
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,090
From that you sent me to the sports school,

154
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,050
helped me join the provincial team,

155
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:02,120
and until we both entered the national team,

156
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,050
it has always been you who helped me

157
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,440
make the right choices.

158
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,360
For me,

159
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,480
you are the closest person.

160
00:07:14,290 --> 00:07:15,360
But as you said,

161
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:20,970
familial love and friendship can be shared.

162
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,290
But as long as I see

163
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,410
those videos of you and Wei,

164
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,880
I can't help but be angry and sad.

165
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,770
I don't know what our relationship is.

166
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,000
It's love.

167
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,610
Lin Ge, you have been avoiding me for a day.

168
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,730
Because you learnt lessons

169
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,730
from Chen Mingyuan and Yu Siyang,

170
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,160
right?

171
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,480
Can we keep some distance

172
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,410
in front of others?

173
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:30,170
I promise you.

174
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,440
Fang Chao, what's the matter?

175
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:01,760
Come in.

176
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,320
(Room 306)
Wei went to other's room.

177
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,280
Come in and say it.

178
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:07,330
Come on.

179
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,290
Nothing's wrong.

180
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,050
I noticed that your training condition

181
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:20,890
is not very good today,

182
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,760
so I came to check on you.

183
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,440
Why are you starting to care

184
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,320
about my training like Nie Chi?

185
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,040
Why

186
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:35,890
didn't I care about you earlier?

187
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:37,680
What are you saying?

188
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,250
You've always cared about me.

189
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:42,440
I noticed before we joined the team

190
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,530
that you can't stop talking about Nie Chi.

191
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,760
I...

192
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,960
Why didn't I realize it?

193
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,410
Then I'll be careful in the future.

194
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,960
When you trained during the day,

195
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,560
the coach stared at you a few times.

196
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,010
Take it seriously.

197
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,560
Don't worry, I'll adjust my condition.

198
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:11,050
You're in the same dorm as Nie Chi.

199
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,440
You also help me remind him.

200
00:10:15,130 --> 00:10:17,560
No, I can't. You remind him.

201
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,370
It's more appropriate.

202
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,770
In fact, the two of us...

203
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:22,610
That's it.

204
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,680
That's it.

205
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,010
I'm going.

206
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,650
Is it that obvious?

207
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,250
What's wrong?

208
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:51,960
Look at Lin Ge.

209
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,290
She's full of beans.

210
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,090
A few days ago,

211
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,440
she was depressed and you said it's bad.

212
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,290
Now she gets pumped up, it's not good either.

213
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,410
It's so hard to satisfy you.

214
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:09,490
It's not normal. Can't you tell?

215
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,320
What can I do even so?

216
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:13,370
I remind you

217
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:16,290
these kids born after 1995 are different.

218
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,890
They are not like us back then

219
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,320
when we listened to the coach.

220
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,840
They have their own ideas.

221
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,840
If they really get emotional,

222
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,840
let alone a coach,

223
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,530
their parents are not working well.

224
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:30,490
How about I give them a warning?

225
00:11:31,010 --> 00:11:31,850
No way.

226
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,010
A friendly warning.

227
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:35,850
Is it ok?

228
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:37,890
You handle it appropriately.

229
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,920
You have a lot of things to do.

230
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,080
What are you doing in my place?

231
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,370
You affect the training, you know?

232
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,840
I know.

233
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,440
The TV station needs someone to shoot.

234
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:49,770
Why don't you go?

235
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:50,920
No way.

236
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,120
Can't we negotiate?

237
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,970
We can't.

238
00:11:53,410 --> 00:11:55,490
Otherwise, I won't let them go.

239
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,200
Fine. You go ahead.

240
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:15,330
Let me tell you something.

241
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,290
You know during this olympiad

242
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,010
many players left the national team,

243
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,440
some have retired,

244
00:12:22,890 --> 00:12:24,270
some have returned to the provincial team,

245
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:26,170
and others went to study.

246
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,680
So the team discussed it and wanted

247
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,650
to make an adjustment to your dorms.

248
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,960
It won't be adjusted when the dorm is full.

249
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,410
If it is not fully occupied,

250
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,840
then put you together by events.

251
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,610
Any problem?

252
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,800
No.

253
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,920
Ok, I'll say a few more words.

254
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,800
No matter which team you're in,

255
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,200
you won't stay there forever.

256
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,720
It's normal for people to come and go.

257
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:56,170
In the national team,

258
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,960
you can receive the highest level of training.

259
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,170
Here,

260
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,290
you live according to the olympiad.

261
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,080
The time to compete in major tournaments

262
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,170
is only a few years.

263
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,650
Two olympiads for girls.

264
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,080
A little longer for boys. Three olympiads.

265
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:13,080
What I'm trying to say is

266
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,890
I hope you can all

267
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,290
cherish these years here

268
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:19,560
and always remind yourself

269
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,370
what you are doing here.

270
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,800
Be worthy of the cultivation of the country.

271
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,200
Be worthy of yourself.

272
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,280
Understand?

273
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,770
Understood.

274
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,770
That's all for today.

275
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,840
Lin Ge, what should we do?

276
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,050
- Lin Ge.
- No worries.

277
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,160
Come here.

278
00:13:42,770 --> 00:13:44,080
You go back first. Don't worry.

279
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,440
Mr. Li.

280
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,290
What do you need from me?

281
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,920
I come to listen to your instruction.

282
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,010
Your training condition is good today.

283
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,370
Keep it up. Don't waver anymore.

284
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,720
Got it, Mr. Li.

285
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:18,960
Why did you just run up to the coach

286
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,010
and admit it?

287
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:21,490
Did I still need to admit?

288
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,890
When Mr. Li talked about the olympiad,

289
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,050
he was watching us.

290
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,320
I felt it.

291
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,320
But that's different.

292
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,080
What's the difference?

293
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,290
He warned us and no one would notice it.

294
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:32,680
But you ran straight to him.

295
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,050
Wasn't that just showing your hand?

296
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,600
Is there a difference?

297
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,680
Didn't we agree on this?

298
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:40,890
Forget it.

299
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,680
You're angry.

300
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,800
I have observed.

301
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,840
They went to eat or returned to the dorm.

302
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,080
No one saw us.

303
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,290
What are you afraid of Mr. Li?

304
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:15,130
Is he scarier than Ms. Han?

305
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,170
I can't see through him.

306
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:21,410
He speaks quite directly sometimes.

307
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,320
Sometimes he hints at it in a vague manner.

308
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,130
He always wears a smile.

309
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,320
But he is ruthless in doing things.

310
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,770
He broke Chen Mingyuan and Yu Siyang up

311
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,530
and let the inexperienced Xie Lingwei

312
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:32,730
to compete instead of a senior sister.

313
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,010
I'm really afraid of him.

314
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,080
It's your animal intuition.

315
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,400
You are guarding against him.

316
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,130
Animal intuition?

317
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:49,320
Are you indirectly saying

318
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,170
that I'm not smart?

319
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:53,200
How dare you say that!

320
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,280
You...

321
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,560
How dare you!

322
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:22,840
Dorms are adjusted.

323
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:25,850
We have not changed.

324
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:28,840
Didn't the coach say

325
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,030
they don't adjust the ready-made ones?

326
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,960
We're not affected.

327
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,410
Let me have a look.

328
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:35,700
(Gao Kai, Nie Chi, Fang Chao, Jin Xinxin)

329
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,960
Nie Chi shares a room with Gao Kai.

330
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:39,410
What about Fang Chao?

331
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,440
What do you mean?

332
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:53,030
What's wrong with you recently?

333
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,680
If there is something, just say it.

334
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,410
Let's make it clear at once.

335
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:00,050
Are you taking me as a brother?

336
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,650
Are you taking me as a brother?

337
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,250
You and Lin Ge are together.

338
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:06,120
Why don't you tell me?

339
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,320
I treat you as my brother.

340
00:17:08,770 --> 00:17:10,250
I tell you everything.

341
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:11,970
You take me as a brother,

342
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:13,590
but you confess your love for Lin Ge

343
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:16,800
behind my back, right?

344
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,160
The three of us stay together every day.

345
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,450
Stay together every day.

346
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,530
You two just think I'm a fool.

347
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,640
You think that I don't know anything.

348
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,840
You think I'm transparent, right?

349
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,250
Nie Chi, let me tell you,

350
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,080
Lin Ge's childhood sweetheart

351
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,800
is me.

352
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,320
When Lin Ge was bullied by Lin Feng,

353
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,400
the man who helped her out every day

354
00:17:49,210 --> 00:17:50,490
was still me.

355
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,770
Every year on her birthday,

356
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:54,800
the person who accompanied her,

357
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,490
no once was missed,

358
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,930
was me.

359
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,160
It was still me.

360
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,290
When she needed company the most,

361
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:02,560
where were you?

362
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,450
You were in Beijing.

363
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:05,730
You were living well there.

364
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:07,210
You lived very well.

365
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,840
What did you come back?

366
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,490
Why come back?

367
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:13,800
My family is not as good as yours.

368
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,690
I'm not as good as you.

369
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,290
You've been the best since you were a kid.

370
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,290
You are top notch in everything.

371
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,360
Everyone's around you.

372
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,530
But Nie Chi, you know,

373
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,930
when you got good grades

374
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:32,730
and your parents agreed you to stay

375
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,120
and go further with us,

376
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,210
I was happier than you.

377
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:41,400
When you can't overtake others,

378
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,690
you can't do it,

379
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:47,290
I was more anxious than you.

380
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,210
I think of you and Lin Ge

381
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,160
as the most important persons in my life.

382
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,840
I thought I could exchange it for sincerity.

383
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,680
But...

384
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:02,080
But I find I don't deserve it.

385
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,250
Because I think

386
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:05,800
it's just my wishful thinking.

387
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,600
Why did you come back?

388
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,970
You came back to take Lin Ge

389
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,290
from me, right?

390
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,050
Right?

391
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,290
I like Lin Ge.

392
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,120
Don't you know?

393
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:24,970
I like Lin Ge.

394
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:29,120
Don't you really know?

395
00:19:31,290 --> 00:19:35,010
Chao, I like Lin Ge.

396
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,400
I treat you as a brother.

397
00:19:38,210 --> 00:19:39,690
I never wanted to hide it from you.

398
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,640
But I really didn't think

399
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,690
that you like her too.

400
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:44,970
If you hadn't told me

401
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,880
these things today,

402
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:50,210
I didn't realize you would be so wronged.

403
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,560
Did that punch just relieve your anger?

404
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,880
Come again if you still feel angry.

405
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,640
Hit me until you feel comfortable.

406
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,240
Come on.

407
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,160
Hit me.

408
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,260
(National Ice Sports Base)

409
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,360
What happened to your face?

410
00:20:56,560 --> 00:20:58,930
I bumped it when I got up in the dark.

411
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:00,770
Got up in the dark?

412
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,250
Let me ask you again.

413
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,930
What happened to your face?

414
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,730
I really bumped it by accident.

415
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,210
Fang Chao.

416
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,330
You tell me.

417
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:13,640
Did he accidentally bump his face?

418
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:21,400
I don't know. I've moved away.

419
00:21:23,690 --> 00:21:24,770
Moved away?

420
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,530
It's not over if you don't tell the truth.

421
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,850
Don't...

422
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:38,690
Good morning, everyone.

423
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,010
Good morning.

424
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:43,360
Today, the training...

425
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,320
What's wrong with your face?

426
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,360
He crashed into the pole, Mr. Li.

427
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,490
Really?

428
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,050
The pole is in the middle of the road, right?

429
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,560
The pole on the side. I can testify.

430
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,680
Nie Chi,

431
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:06,320
come to my office after the training.

432
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,700
Start training.

433
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:12,320
Crash into a pole?

434
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,880
What a ridiculous reason!

435
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,840
Gao Kai

436
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,880
is so afraid that I don't know

437
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:19,400
Nie Chi and Fang Chao fought.

438
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,560
He ran out in a hurry to testify.

439
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:22,770
Is he stupid?

440
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,450
Have some tea.

441
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,320
How's the situation on the ice lately?

442
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,160
Fang Chao and Jin Xinxin

443
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,160
are first and second every time they start.

444
00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:38,530
They became the last two in the sprint phase.

445
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:39,730
Funny guys.

446
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,560
Nie Chi

447
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,250
didn't skate 1,500m very often,

448
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,140
but faster than both of them.

449
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,490
Nie Chi knows how to distribute strength.

450
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:49,450
Jin Xinxin has limited talent.

451
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:50,640
Forget about him.

452
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:55,490
Fang Chao's stamina and skills are fine.

453
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,690
Why did he keep sliding?

454
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,320
He's one-track minded.

455
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,400
He will stick to what he has decided.

456
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:02,920
This matter,

457
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,450
you have to give him a warning.

458
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:05,800
He must be corrected.

459
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:06,890
Got it.

460
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,050
Then I'm going.

461
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,240
Lin Ge.

462
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,680
Lin Ge.

463
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,250
What's wrong with your face?

464
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,400
It was really an accident.

465
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,970
Don't be angry, ok?

466
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:35,130
Fang Chao.

467
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:36,320
Here.

468
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
I have something to talk to Seven Gold.

469
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:47,770
What's the matter?

470
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:06,770
I see.

471
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,610
Come with me.

472
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,200
You guys had a fight?

473
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:27,080
Why?

474
00:24:29,290 --> 00:24:30,130
He likes you, too.

475
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,290
Like me?

476
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,890
His exact words.

477
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
I have something to talk to you after dinner.

478
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,400
What's the matter?

479
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,400
I'll give you a birthday gift.

480
00:24:42,910 --> 00:24:43,800
Apart from the cake,

481
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,490
did you also prepare gifts for me?

482
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,600
Not us. It's me.

483
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,480
Ok.

484
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:50,560
After the training...

485
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:52,360
If you have time after the training,

486
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,840
just wait until you finish training.

487
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,800
As long as you're free, I'm ok with it.

488
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,970
What about after dinner?

489
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:59,050
Sure. It's a deal.

490
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,730
So he asked me out on my birthday

491
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:06,250
because he wanted to confess his love for me.

492
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,240
Yes.

493
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,530
Then why didn't you tell me earlier?

494
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,450
I didn't know before.

495
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,880
Then what should I do now?

496
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,450
I can't talk to him

497
00:25:15,450 --> 00:25:16,530
like this right now.

498
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,320
If he's not so bad,

499
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,360
I'll go find him again.

500
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
How can you wait?

501
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:21,640
If you continue to wait,

502
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,770
everyone will drift apart.

503
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,450
What if we can't be friends anymore?

504
00:25:26,490 --> 00:25:27,330
No way.

505
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:28,770
I can't allow this to go on like this.

506
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,600
I have to figure out how to solve it.

507
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,480
This is a matter between me and Fang Chao.

508
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,400
This is also between me and Fang Chao.

509
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:35,490
It's a matter of three of us.

510
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,010
Why do you get me out?

511
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,220
(National Team Rehabilitation Center)

512
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,090
Hai.

513
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,530
Hai.

514
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,610
Who are you looking for?

515
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,890
You...

516
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,450
I'm the new physical therapist Shi Tiantian.

517
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,560
Tell me what's wrong with you.

518
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,290
I have a little muscle bruised.

519
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,130
-Then...
- Sit there.

520
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:03,770
Is it here?

521
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,490
It feels a little tight.

522
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,730
How do you feel?

523
00:26:10,050 --> 00:26:12,560
I feel so much more comfortable.

524
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,400
Is there anything else uncomfortable?

525
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:16,080
It's comfortable everywhere.

526
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,210
You're Fang Chao, huh?

527
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,080
How do you know?

528
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,160
I've heard about you.

529
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,400
Many people are in relationships in the team.

530
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:26,730
But you are the first one

531
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,880
who dare fight your rival in love.

532
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:28,920
Come on.

533
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,530
Say it and relieve my boredom.

534
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,080
Say what? Why are you so nosy?

535
00:26:36,250 --> 00:26:37,380
Come on.

536
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:39,810
Tell me.

537
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:43,600
Whatever.

538
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,560
I'm man. I'm not afraid.

539
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,490
We two, the girl and I,

540
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:54,210
are childhood friends,

541
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,800
not exactly,

542
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,800
we grow up together.

543
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,450
Every morning

544
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,710
when we get up and open the door,

545
00:27:04,710 --> 00:27:06,160
we can see each other.

546
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,640
We brush our teeth and eat together.

547
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,400
We go to school and practice together.

548
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,530
We do everything together.

549
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,290
We haven't been apart since we were little.

550
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:14,840
I feel

551
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,320
we have long become very close person

552
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,450
in each other's lives.

553
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,210
You know, from childhood friends

554
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:20,490
to a couple in love,

555
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:22,450
isn't that what it says in the script?

556
00:27:22,930 --> 00:27:23,770
And then what?

557
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:24,680
Then...

558
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,240
Then...

559
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,080
Then one day I found out

560
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,120
the person closest to her

561
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,250
is not me.

562
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:37,530
Do you think

563
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,880
I read the wrong script?

564
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,360
If you read the wrong script,

565
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,400
I suggest

566
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,900
that you quit.

567
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,020
(National Ice Sports Base)

568
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:58,180
(Honorary Champion Wall)

569
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,320
Why don't you go up first?

570
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,800
I'll wait for him here myself.

571
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,450
What do you want to talk to Fang Chao?

572
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,360
I don't know.

573
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,970
Let's wait until he comes.

574
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,360
Why don't you make an outline first?

575
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:11,530
You must be crazy.

576
00:28:11,730 --> 00:28:13,690
Who makes an outline before a chat?

577
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:16,160
You go up first.

578
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,930
Fang Chao, wait a minute.

579
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,320
Gao Kai has been looking for you.

580
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,690
Why don't you go up first?

581
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,450
(Friendship among adults)

582
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:41,250
(always has some decent understanding.)

583
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,250
(I start avoiding you)

584
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,970
(and then you don't provoke me again.)

585
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,790
(The onlookers naturally won't mention)

586
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,320
(each other in front of the two people.)

587
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:50,400
Chao...

588
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,250
(The friendship can decently come to an end,)

589
00:28:53,710 --> 00:28:54,560
(and when we meet again,)

590
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,770
(we can greet with a nod and a smile.)

591
00:28:57,630 --> 00:28:59,880
(But if the other party is Fang Chao,)

592
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:02,250
(let decency to go away.)

593
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,690
(I just want to ask him)

594
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,600
(why you don't play with me.)

595
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,050
I already know all of it.

596
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,210
Nie Chi told me.

597
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,250
He just sold me like this?

598
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:29,250
I haven't figured out what to say,

599
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,210
but I can't just say nothing

600
00:29:31,210 --> 00:29:33,490
and do nothing either.

601
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:35,770
I want to say thank you for liking me.

602
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,600
Fang Chao, you are a good person.

603
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:40,480
I...

604
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:44,970
I'm in the friend zone.

605
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,800
We are still friends anyway.

606
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,890
Right?

607
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,930
Besides being friends,

608
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,560
do I still have hope?

609
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,250
I know the answer even if you don't say.

610
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:19,450
I am just struggling.

611
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,880
Don't have any burden on your mind.

612
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:26,080
Actually, I've been confused until now,

613
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,010
you know?

614
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,600
Because

615
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,560
I always think I am very manly.

616
00:30:30,970 --> 00:30:32,290
I have a big heart.

617
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:34,050
I can pick it up and put it down.

618
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:35,600
But this time

619
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:39,250
when this happened to myself,

620
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:43,970
why can't I understand myself?

621
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:48,530
I admit I'm a little jealous of Nie Chi.

622
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:52,120
I don't know how to face you either.

623
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,800
So when I'm thinking about this,

624
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,120
the more I think about it, the angrier I get.

625
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,970
I don't know where I got the motivation,

626
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:02,930
then I just fought with him.

627
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,080
It's good to be able to vent your anger.

628
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,600
It's all my fault.

629
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,440
It's not your fault.

630
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,160
I can figure it out.

631
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:15,290
Give me some time

632
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:17,560
to accept it.

633
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,930
What if

634
00:31:19,930 --> 00:31:21,210
we can't be friends anymore?

635
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:37,690
No way. You're my mom's sweetheart.

636
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:41,160
Anyway, we can't fall apart.

637
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,530
Are you sure?

638
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:45,770
I'm sure.

639
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:54,140
Go back. It's quite late.

He gave me a USB flash disk

648
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,800
and said it was about competitions.

649
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,400
Chao,

650
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:03,050
I have some thoughts

651
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,990
about 1,500m training this afternoon.

652
00:33:07,010 --> 00:33:08,450
Can you actually think?

653
00:33:09,250 --> 00:33:10,530
Let me analyze it for you.

654
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,520
You wait a minute.

655
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:12,840
I'll go wash up first.

656
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,030
I have to say it right now.

657
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,910
Otherwise, I can't tell clearly.

658
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,290
I'm afraid that I'll forget.

659
00:33:19,990 --> 00:33:21,810
Fine, go ahead.

660
00:33:22,450 --> 00:33:23,970
Let me see

661
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,160
what you can say.

662
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:26,840

663
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,500
the main characters are you and Xie Lingwei.

664
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,600
As for the rest of the athletes,

665
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,210
find some younger ones.

666
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,320
Make them familiar with the public.

667
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:35,720
It's easy.

668
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,050

669
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,000
and Lin Ge with you.

670
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:42,160

671

the whole national team?

672
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,090
Ignore him.

00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,010
Nie Chi is ok. He looks energetic.

674
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,730
Can he agree with his character?

675
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,250
He has a big weakness right now.

676
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:57,490
I'll let you know after I have confirmed it.

677
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,640
