42

(Being an athlete is not my choice.)

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,080
(It's a lifeline I grasped by instinct.)

44
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,850

Let's compete.

51
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,450
Good for you. You sneaked in,

52
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,290
but weren't noticed by Mr. Ou.

53
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,570
Let's compete.

54
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,610
Sure. I'm not scared of you.

55
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,850
The finish line is just ahead.

56
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,130
Go!

57
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:43,560
You really are bold.

58
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,610
I won!

59
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,050
You actually came to our school to skate.

60
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,360
Don't worry, I won't call security.

61
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,090
What happened to your face?

62
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:04,970
How did you get hurt?

63
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,880
Save some water.

64
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:10,240
You should skate well

65
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,920
and win a championship when you grow up.

66
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,530
Where did you hide the money?

67
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,530
Didn't your mom leave you any money?

68
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:17,730
I'm good enough to let you live here.

69
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,000
I, I fell...

70
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:26,680
Fell?

71
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,120
I just hit my face on the ground.

72
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,170
Did your hair also fall?

73
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,970
Where did you hide the money?

74
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,810
Where's the money?

75
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,170
I'll just cut your hair off.

76
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:48,920
Yeah, it's too cold in Northeast China.

77
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,800
The hair has frozen and become brittle.

78
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,770
You aren't going home so late.

79
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,610
Aren't you afraid your family will worry?

80
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,000
If you leave, don't come back.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,560
Never come back.

82
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:13,730
Didn't anyone tell you

83
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,120
crossing the line like that doesn't count?

84
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:18,920
Your skates are not for speed skating.

85
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:21,000
If we go two more rounds, you must not win.

00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,850
(Nie Chi, Children's Group Gold Medal)

87
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,880
Look, these are all the competitions I won.

88
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,530
You can even apply for a bonus.

89
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,530
You can earn a bonus?

90
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,760
Of course.

91
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:33,880
Can I come too?

92
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,920
Master, it's true.

93
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,730
That little girl is quite impressive.

94
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,090
And she really wants to come to our school.

95
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,800
Just take her in.

96
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,730
She really has good talent.

97
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,280
Oh my gosh.

98
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,730
You actually talk about talent with me.

99
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,290
Do you know what talent is?

100
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,240
Talent

101
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,440
is like a single flower

102
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,050
in an endless vast grassland.

103
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,320
That's called talent, understand?

104
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,530
Aren't I just that flower?

105
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,110
She's just a little bit worse than me.

106
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,730
Why are you so confident?

107
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:07,560
Do you think you have talent?

108
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:09,130
Let me tell you,

109
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,680
you're really not that flower right now.

110
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,450
You are the soil block under the flower.

111
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,920
You still have to keep working hard.

112
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,530
I have screened

113
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,090
all the kids in our area.

114
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,190
No fish slipped through the net.

115
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,580
What a coincidence, Master.

116
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,610
She is the one that got away.

117
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,770
Anyway, she slipped through the net.

118
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,050
Mistakes are inevitable.

119
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,850
But please believe me

120
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,680
she has a unique fighting spirit.

121
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,280
Master, please accept her.

122
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:54,250
Good!

123
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,640
Good.

124
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,760
Good.

125
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,650
Lin Ge, I nailed it!

126
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,880
Master said good.

127
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,770
When did I say good?

128
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,770
Thank you, Master.

129
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,210
You are the best.

130
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:10,360
You're the best too.

131
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,240
Let me briefly mention a few issues.

132
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,090
Zitong, Zhang Jun,

133
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,920
how many times have I said it?

134
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,920
How to adjust the center of gravity?

135
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,560
Don't make me repeat it again.

136
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:29,490
Little Stone,

137
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,730
your right shoulder,

138
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,480
I must see the change today.

139
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,250
Slide three 500m in a while

140
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,840
and warm up sufficiently.

141
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,050
Finally, our slogan is

142
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,130
for the dream...

143
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,370
Keep it up!

144
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,720
Lin Ge.

145
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:49,010
Who are you?

146
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,560
I am Fang Chao. You're Lin Ge, right?

147
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,010
From now on, we will be teammates.

148
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,080
Nie Chi asked me to give you skates.

149
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,800
Where is Nie Chi?

150
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,600
Why haven't I seen him?

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,490
He is about to move to Beijing.

152
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,970
Let's compete.

153
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,520
I won!

154
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,770
What does he mean?

155
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,530
He failed and just ran away.

156
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,340
(Gym)

157
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,170
This matter is non-negotiable.

158
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,370
We must go to Beijing.

159
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,290
Speak nicely.

160
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Just spoil him.

161
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,410
- Go for it.
- Honey,

162
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:30,650
Dad's meeting was suddenly moved up.

163
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:32,680
- One, two...
- Keep it up!

164
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,490
He's been here for several years.

165
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,290
He may never have any connection

166
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,600
with this place again

167
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,050
after going to Beijing.

168
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,010
We should let him say goodbye to his friends.

169
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,850
One, two...

170
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,050
Keep it up.

171
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,920
One, two...

172
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:01,920
Keep it up.

173
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:05,890
We're back.

174
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,010
We're back.

175
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,010
Welcome, Lin Ge.

176
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,010
Lin Ge, you're here.

177
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:12,890
Come in quickly.

178
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:15,310
Let's go.

179
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,190
Come here.

180
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,600
Take off the backpack.

181
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,650
I can do it myself.

182
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,800
Chao, go get some water.

183
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,640
Ok.

184
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,850
Are you hungry?

185
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,050
Watch TV first. Dinner is coming soon.

186
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,440
Ok, thank you, Mrs. Fang.

187
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,960
Fang, where are the vegetables?

188
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,080
Drink some water first.

189
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Quick, bring them in.

190
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:33,840
I'm changing clothes.

191
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,680
Coming right up!

192
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,440
Why not watch TV?

193
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:37,980
There are chestnuts there.

194
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,130
I bought them.

195
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:41,570
Supernova, fight until the end.

196
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,090
Give it a try.

197
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,490
You eat first.

198
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:45,440
It's really delicious!

199
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,920
Lin Ge,

200
00:10:48,170 --> 00:10:49,440
there is an old saying in China,

201
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:52,050
once a teacher, forever a father.

202
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,800
As your master, I must take care of you.

203
00:10:55,170 --> 00:10:56,560
How many times have you been here?

204
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,170
Why are you still so reserved?

205
00:10:58,170 --> 00:10:59,890
This is not right, you know?

206
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,440
From now on,

207
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,200
you are number one baby in our family.

208
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,800
What does it mean?

209
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,010
I cherish you the most.

210
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,130
He is number two.

211
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,050
Nie Chi is number three.

212
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,320
Lin Ge, I nailed it.

213
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
Master said good.

214
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,520
Ge,

215
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,760
it's the Spring Festival.

216
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,560
I didn't buy you anything.

217
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,380
Here's a little red envelope for you.

218
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,370
I can't take it.

219
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,650
Why can't you take it?

220
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:32,130
It's my kindness.

221
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,410
Just accept it.

222
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,600
This is much money.

223
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:36,920
Mom,

224
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:37,920
Lin Ge came to our house

225
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,600
and specially bought milk.

226
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,890
Good girl.

227
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,130
Come on.

228
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,800
These chestnuts are still warm.

229
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:45,890
Eat it while it's hot.

230
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,730
Thank you.

231
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,650
You have some too.

232
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,600
Play with her for a while.

233
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,680
We're going to eat soon.

234
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,320
Lin Ge, let me bring you something fun.

235
00:11:55,170 --> 00:11:57,050
Honey, there is only one meat dish, huh?

236
00:11:57,370 --> 00:11:58,210
Is this enough?

237
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,530
How about adding a bit more?

238
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,680
Fang,

239
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,290
Lin Ge is not willing to drink milk

240
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:06,170
given during the training.

241
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,050
What a thoughtful kid.

242
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:10,010
I have to say

243
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,650
my wife is beautiful and kind.

244
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:12,490
Stop it.

245
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,160
Honey,

246
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:16,680
do you know why I care

247
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,520
about this girl so much?

248
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,370
Her mom passed away when she was little.

249
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:20,730
Her dad loves to gamble

250
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:21,920
and is deeply in debt.

251
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,200
Now no one knows where he has gone.

252
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,680
All her relatives

253
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,650
treat her as a burden.

254
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,680
No one cares about her.

255
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,920
It is a holiday now.

256
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,290
There is nobody in the dorm.

257
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,840
No food in the cafeteria either.

258
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,410
So I just think...

259
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:34,640
So when Lin Ge comes again next time,

260
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:36,170
she will sleep with me.

261
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:37,970
What about me?

262
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:38,910
Sofa.

263
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,320
Our son is sleeping on the sofa.

264
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,200
Squeeze in. That's enough.

265
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,610
Come in.

266
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,440
Mrs. Fang.

267
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,520
Have you finished?

268
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,050
Master,

269
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:53,490
where are you going?

270
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:00,650
I came from the Tang Dynasty

271
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,960
and is going to obtain the scriptures.

272
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:07,960
You little girls must not

273
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:09,890
like this piece of clothing.

274
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,440
But it is new.

275
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,680
I bought it at the department store.

276
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,370
In a couple of days, I will buy you

277
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,410
some clothes that suit you.

278
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,010
Next time you can wear your own clothes.

279
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,370
Thank you.

280
00:13:38,650 --> 00:13:41,010
Happy New Year, Ge.

281
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,200
You are one year older.

282
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,560
(Happy New Year, Mom.)

283
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,920

49.12s.

299
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,960
Great job, Lin Ge.

300
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,800
You refresh your best record again.

301
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,610
Only one second away from 48s.

302
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,230
♪Stay true to your beliefs♪

303
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,370
You are still two seconds behind me.

304

You look so happy.

305
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,230
I almost forgot the main thing.

306
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:36,660
Today is my mom's birthday.

307
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,080
Master said he'll prepare a big surprise.

308
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:39,920
Hurry up.

309
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,480
What's the big surprise?

310
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,080
Why didn't my dad tell me?

311
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,650
Master said to keep it a secret.

312
00:15:44,890 --> 00:15:46,010
You will know soon.

313
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:51,300
(Guansheng Hot Spring)

314
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,250
The bathing is divided into four parts,

315
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,600
showering, bathing, steaming, scrubbing.

316
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,680
You must have ample physical strength.

317
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:00,260
Coupons are hard to get.

318
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,370
Time is limited.

319
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,200
Get changed within three minutes

320
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,800
and gather on the second floor.

321
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,570
- Understand?
- Understood.

322
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:13,920
There are ten seconds left

323
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:14,940
until the coupon takes effect.

324
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,640
Five,

325
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:17,560
four,

326
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,560
three,

327
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,850
two,

328
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:20,720
one.

329
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,560
Go!

330
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:30,600
Exercise before meals prevents overeating.

331
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,490
One, two, three, four.

332
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:46,890
Let's review

333
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:48,530
our self-service guide.

334
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,290
Beverages.

335
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,130
Do not touch.

336
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,050
Fruits before the meal.

337
00:16:52,050 --> 00:16:52,890
One is enough.

338
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:53,890
Seafood and meat.

339
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:54,730
Have fun with it.

340
00:16:55,010 --> 00:16:55,890
Snacks and desserts.

341
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:56,880
Go all out.

342
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,280
Go!

343
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,400
Master, there is one hour left.

344
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:28,600
New dishes will be served again.

345
00:17:29,490 --> 00:17:30,840
Number one baby,

346
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,290
eat more?

347
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,080
I was already full half an hour ago.

348
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,360
It's already up to my throat.

349
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,160
If I eat any more,

350
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:43,610
I'll just...

351
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,290
Here, Master.

352
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,640
Have another hawthorn pill.

353
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:53,490
You'll see the effect immediately.

354
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,050
You have it.

355
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,110
Come on.

356
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,010
Turn your pockets inside out.

357
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:06,080
Isn't there the digestive tablets?

358
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:09,490
Are we going to fight till the end?

359
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,010
Stop nonsense.

360
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,250
If we don't finish all these today,

361
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,050
it's not worthy of the money Master spent.

362
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:18,730
All right.

363
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,320
All right.

364
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Awesome!

365
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,120
No loud noises in public places.

372
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,660
My mom asked me to bring this to you.

Eat again?

374
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,250
Did I just run for nothing?

375
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,690
Come on.

376
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:54,450

00:19:57,050 --> 00:19:58,320
has three inner layers.

380
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,160
Insulation is very good.

381
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,260
This morning,

382
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,800
I saw my mom scooping one spoonful

383
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,160
after another into it.

384
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,030
It's not soup.

385
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,080
It's all filled with her love for you.

386
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:12,050
The provincial team is coming.

387
00:20:12,330 --> 00:20:13,210
These past two years,

388
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:14,640
good players can't be connected.

389
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,250
I feel anxious about this.

390
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:18,450
It's time for Lin Ge and others

391
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:20,050
to present their results.

392
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,770
I must find a good way for them, anyway.

393
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:24,160
I...

394
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:25,770
Definitely.

395
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:29,120
That must be Master driving you here.

396
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,800
You just ran from the gate to here.

397
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,690
You're exaggerating it.

398
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,320
I took the bus here this morning.

399
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:35,310
I was exhausted.

400
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,180
I have to protect this

401
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,620
while I still have to grasp the handrail.

402
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,260
I kept swaying

403
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:41,340
back and forth.

404
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,500
Mainly because my dad in the morning...

405
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:46,820
He drove to the airport to pick up someone.

406
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,820
This morning,

407
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,140
he has been whispering

408
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,340
to my mom.

409
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:52,260
It's mysterious.

410
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,520
I don't know who they went to pick up.

411
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,630
Could it be that it's the provincial team?

412
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,820
Lin Ge has great talent.

413
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,050
It would be better to practice earlier.

414
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,780
Oh my gosh, you have no idea

415
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
how much effort I put in

416
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:07,340
to get Lin Ge into sports school.

417
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,620
Her grandma

418
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,340
is superstitious and feudal,

419
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:13,820
insisting that Lin Ge restrains Lin Feng

420
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,060
and refusing them to learn skating together.

421
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,100
This is really nonsense.

422
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,780
Watch the road. Don't get too excited.

423
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,660
Why so excited?

424
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,020
Safety first, safety first.

425
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:27,380
To be serious,

426
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,380
various teams have been recruiting people.

427
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,540
You should work hard too.

428
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:32,180
Don't let it turn out like what Master said:

429
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,620
you can only sweep the streets

430
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:35,660
while watching me become successful.

431
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,380
Don't you protect me anymore?

432
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,100
Don't waste it.

433
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,140
I'm going.

434
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:56,940
Let's compete.

435
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,500
Let's compete.

436
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:48,780
The finish line is just ahead.

437
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,860
The finish line is just ahead.

438
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,260
Go!

439
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,700
Go!

440
00:23:08,780 --> 00:23:09,780
I won!

441
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:14,660
I won!

442
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,660
Lin Ge, don't you remember me?

443
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:29,340
Nie Chi! Why did you suddenly come back?

444
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,900
What have you been eating in Beijing?

445
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,340
How did you suddenly grow so tall?

446
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,020
I'm back to train.

447
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,100
Train? Are you still leaving?

448
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,180
I'm not.

449
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:39,540
I'll just stay at the sports school,

450
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,180
and be a professional athlete in the team.

451
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:42,580
That would be great!

452
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:45,820
Your hair looks quite good this time.

453
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:48,040
What happened to your face?

454
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,340
I... I fell.

455
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,140
Did your hair also fall?

456
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,140
I never got the chance to thank you.

457
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,860
If it weren't for you,

458
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
I might not even have control over my hair.

459
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,340
I'm doing really well now.

460
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,860
I'll have your back from now on.

461
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,820
You are much more cheerful than before.

462
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,940
Who's that?

463
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,380
Who is messing around over there?

464
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,100
Are you wandering around on the rink?

465
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,020
Mr. Ou, it's me. Nie.

466
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:17,020
Who is Nie?

467
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,170
I am Nie Chi.

468
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,980
Who is Nie Chi?

469
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,820
Don't mess with me.

470
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:24,140
Go to the security room with me.

471
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,100
Fang Chao. You're acting, aren't you?

472
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:28,420
Are you looking for trouble?

473
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,820
How did you two know it was me?

474
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,900
Fang Chao.

475
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,540
You are really good, Nie Chi.

476
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,900
When I got home, I saw

477
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,500
your luggage arrived before you did.

478
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,780
What are you doing here?

479
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,580
I miss this rink so much.

480
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,580
All right. Don't waste time talking to him.

481
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,820
He just tricked us both.

482
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,380
What do you think we should do?

483
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,740
- I...
- It's up to you.

484
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,940
Give him a lesson.

485
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,220
No, no, no.

486
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,340
No, no, no.

487
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,180
My shoes dropped.

488
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,340
How dare you trick us just now!

489
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,900
- Remember this.
- I surrender.

490
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,580
- Remember this?
- I surrender.

491
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,020
Look at that Nie Chi.

492
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:06,280
He really likes to pretend to be noble.

493
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,980
You haven't seen

494
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,620
how grand he was when he went to Beijing.

495
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:11,540
Now his family is out of money.

496
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,740
His parents don't want him anymore,

497
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:14,180
so he came back to stay in the dorm.

498
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,900
Just live in the warehouse.

499
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,340
There's an empty bed in our dorm.

500
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,260
Why don't you let him stay?

501
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,740
How could I let him stay?

502
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,980
He is destined to live in the warehouse.

503
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:28,980
I'm good enough to let you live here.

504
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:38,580
Where does Nie Chi live?

505
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,100
That room at the end of the hall.

506
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,900
That room used for storing equipment.

507
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,540
Can that place actually be lived in?

508
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:44,660
You don't care about him.

509
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:47,780
He disliked living with other people

510
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,780
and wanted to live there.

511
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,180
What does it have to do with me?

512
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,740
Come in.

513
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,040
Why are you living in the warehouse?

514
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,580
Before it gets dark,

515
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,420
both of us have to tidy up your room

516
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,380
that you can live.

517
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,700
Both of us?

518
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,740
Do you have any objections?

519
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,100
I'm just temporarily living here.

520
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:39,300
It's fine to clean it casually.

521
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:40,820
No need to worry so much.

522
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,260
Aren't you short on money?

523
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,060
Why buy these useless things?

524
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,300
Even so, I still have to live well.

525
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,060
These things are readily available.

526
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,020
They don't cost much.

527
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,340
That's also money.

528
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,580
Many a little makes a mickle.

529
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,980
What if it becomes useful in the future?

530
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,060
Don't consider too much.

531
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,180
When is 'the future'?

532
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,540
Young man, let me tell you,

533
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,340
if you don't cherish your current life,

534
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,860
you still won't be happy

535
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,140
even if you become the world champion.

536
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,500
I raised the flowers. It's for you.

537
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,260
They can be seen everywhere on the green belt.

538
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,920
It's particularly easy to take care of.

539
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,020
Give it some sunlight and it will shine.

540
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,580
Just put it on the windowsill.

541
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:28,690
When it gets dry,

542
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,820
just water it a little.

543
00:27:33,010 --> 00:27:33,860
I didn't expect

544
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,020
to be more exhausting on a day off.

545
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,100
If there's nothing else, I'll leave.

546
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,340
Fang Chao's call.

547
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,340
Hello? Chao.

548
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,300
All right. We will go over there now.

549
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,100
What's wrong?

550
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,860
Master wants to meet us. Let's go.

551
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,300
Today is a day off.

552
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,580
All three of you are here.

553
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,580
I want to tell you something in advance.

554
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,340
The registration for the training camp

555
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,740
is about to start soon.

556
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,140
The registration fee is 2,000 yuan.

557
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,060
The announcement will be made tomorrow.

558
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,300
Nie Chi, you came back just in time.

559
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,380
Prepare well and participate in it.

560
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,580
Mr. Fang,

561
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:21,860
if I heard it correctly,

562
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:22,900
this is a competition, right?

563
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,420
We'll compete with the provincial team.

564
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,180
In that case, I won't participate.

565
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,450
I'm thinking

566
00:28:28,450 --> 00:28:29,540
of saving 2,000 yuan for our family.

567
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,060
Look at you.

568
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,620
How can I compete with the provincial team?

569
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,780
But you haven't competed yet.

570
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,020
How do you know you can't compete?

571
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,860
Don't think too much about it.

572
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:39,100
Just practice hard.

573
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:40,580
If you can't get into the provincial team,

574
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,020
you see, I'll knock you out.

575
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,580
Nie Chi, are you ok with it?

576
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:47,820
I'm ok.

577
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,660
Okay.

578
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,540
Let me reiterate it again.

579
00:28:51,780 --> 00:28:53,580
We treat this training

580
00:28:53,740 --> 00:28:55,140
as a competition.

581
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:56,340
Be more attentive.

582
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,260
Practice hard.

583
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,120
Whether you can get into the provincial team

584
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,540
depends on this competition.

585
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,740
Come on, our slogan is,

586
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,060
for the dream...

587
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:06,740
- Don't shout mindlessly...
- Keep it up.

588
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,780
Registration forms. Take it.

589
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,860
Here. Nie Chi.

590
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,260
Here. Lin Ge.

591
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,140
You come here.

592
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,420
Let's go.

593
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,860
The Jiangnan Team

594
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,420
has started the process.

595
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:24,930
In about half a month,

596
00:29:24,930 --> 00:29:25,860
there will be a reply.

597
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,140
You take the registration form.

598
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,660
Think about it carefully.

599
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,260
(Training Camp Registration Form)

600
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,140
Thank you, Master.

601
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,180
Keep it up.

602
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,180
Honey, these buns are delicious today.

603
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:52,900
Eat more.

604
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:55,060
Don't eat anymore. You should lose weight.

605
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,140
You two

606
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,380
leave some meat for my sweetheart.

607
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,340
Here. Eat more.

608
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:02,220
Thank you, Mrs. Fang.

609
00:30:03,780 --> 00:30:04,780
Master, Mrs. Fang,

610
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,340
I decide to join the Jiangnan Team.

611
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,740
Are you really going to such a far place?

612
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,380
I used to stay in Jiangnan.

613
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:16,620
I still want to go back and take a look.

614
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,540
It's good.

615
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,940
Pretty good.

616
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,140
It's ok, Mrs. Fang.

617
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,140
I will come back to see you

618
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:24,360
during winter and summer vacations.

619
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,660
You run all the way to Jiangnan.

620
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,100
Don't miss me or cry later.

621
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,100
Who will miss you?

622
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,140
Let's see who will cry then.

623
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:37,020
It must be you who cry loudly.

624
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:38,180
Eat your buns.
