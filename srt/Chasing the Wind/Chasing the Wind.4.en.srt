Han, you're being a bully.

00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,890
You've made enemies of them.

When I came back from the bathroom

45
00:02:25,570 --> 00:02:27,410
and prepared to water the flowers,

46
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,610
I found they were gone.

00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,330

I don't need evidence.

00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,410
I'll teach you a lesson, okay?

53
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:38,070
- Teach you a lesson.
- Enough. Stop.

54
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,600
Get off him.

55
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:40,800
Get off me.

00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,450

Why did you stop me?

58
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,570
He's always lying.

59
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,010
I have to teach him a lesson.

60
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,690
What a sucker.

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,540
Don't argue with him.

62
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,850
He's a rascal.

63
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:06,730
Don't tell Lin Ge about this.

64
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,360
She's got a lot of worries.

65
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,240
I know.

66
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,920
I just can't get over it.

67
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,410
He's Lin Ge's younger brother.

68
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,330
Why are they so different?

69
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,360
So annoying.

70
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,220
He was spoiled.

71
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:26,520
I'm so pissed off.

72
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,310

Are you serious?

76
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,750
Do you have to write that down?

77
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,520
In this case, I don't need
to check my phone back and forth

78
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,050
so that it can last a few more days.

79
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,520
I'm so impressed.

80
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,450
You're frugal with

81
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,680
your phone and the hairdryer.

82
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,800
Your hair is still wet.

83
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,930

84
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,010
I'm poor.

Besides,

86
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:03,850
the hairdryer was a gift from Mrs. Fang,

87
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:05,240
so I have to use it sparingly.

Thanks, Senior Sister Yao.

92
00:04:19,210 --> 00:04:21,120
you've never called me that way.

Yao,

94
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:24,410
our team can get medals, right?

95
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,970
I can participate in the relay, right?

96
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,160
Of course. Why would our coach

97
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,770
form a team that can't win a medal?

98
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,410
If I can compete at every stop...

99
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,010
Yao,

100
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,970
is the prize money
settled after each stop

101
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:37,740
or after the championship is over?

102
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,970
It's up to the finance department,

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
but usually, it won't be delayed
until the end of the season.

104
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,050
That's great.

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,840

109
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,530
I can buy them

00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,770

Don't they look good?

114
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,360
Look at you.

00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,730
if you're not in a hurry to buy it,

117
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:09,730
we'll compare prices first.

00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,170

Once the season begins,

123
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,530
stay away from Zhu

124
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,120
and keep quiet in the dorm.

125

or pain pills?

00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:43,440
Why do you need

those pills?

138
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:46,120
Not for me. It's for Zhu.

139

He's having a fever. 39 degrees.

142
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:16,580
The doctor asked him to rest.

143
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,060
It's the meat bun that he hid
under his armpit

144
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,180
that really has a fever.

145
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:21,020
I got it.

I'll be in the office.

155
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,860
Newcomers should follow the arrangements
in the first year.

Jia Xinyan, and Tian Yu

159
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,380
will focus on the relay.

Lin Ge,

161
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,740
you did well in basic training.

162
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,080
Keep practicing.

163
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,620

164
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,660

- Come on.

- Come on.
- Let's go.

167
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,410
Hurry.

168
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,580
Start training.

169
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,500
Come in.

170
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,220
What's wrong?

171
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:39,780
Coach,

172
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,220
I have a question.

173
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,220
My assessment results
are better than Tian Yu's.

174
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,700
Why can't I practice relay?

175
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,100
It's not the same thing.

176
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,700
Her speed is slow

177
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,540
because of her core strength,

178
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:51,460
which can be improved.

179
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:54,700
You need to correct your movements.

180
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,700
If you develop bad habits,

181
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,620
you won't be able to

182
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,580
improve your speed anymore.

183
00:09:00,190 --> 00:09:01,030
But

184
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:03,460
it doesn't conflict with
the competition, does it?

185
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,580
Why do you want to compete?

186
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,580
Because...

187
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,940
I want to win.

188
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:15,820
I told you to trust your coach.

189
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,940
It's only been a few days.

190
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,820
Did you forget it all?

191
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:27,620
It's time to train.

192
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,940
Stop wasting time.

193
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,780
Just go.

194
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,980
Thanks, coach.

195
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,940
Just put it here.

196
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,580
Gather up.

197
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,020
Come on.

198
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,980
Newcomers, you've had
enough time to adjust,

199
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,320
and I know each member's situation.

200
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,740
From now on,

201
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:22,140
you're officially enrolled
by Songbei Provincial Team.

202
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,100
However, don't get carried away.

203
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,660
Listen carefully,

204
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,020
if you can't meet the standard,

205
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,540
you'll be kicked out immediately.

206
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:35,130
Let's talk about the men's team.

207
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,980
Nie Chi, Fang Chao,

208
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,460
do tactical simulations with the seniors.

209
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,460
Ever covered for others?

210
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,580
No.

211
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,780
I've been trained

212
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,420
but never competed in a real race.

213
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,320
Coach, I'll deal with them.

214
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:57,580
Liu Yang and I

215
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,940
will take them for a few laps.

216
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,820
Don't worry. They won't let you down.

217
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,020
Look at Nie Chi. He's adorable.

218
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,380
Huang Han is so pretentious.

219
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,500
Is he going to bully them?

220
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm not sure.

221
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,780
Our coach is in the training hall.
She'll come here later.

222
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,500
We'll start practicing.

223
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,380
Well, let's do a few rounds of 500m.

224
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,260
Get ready.

225
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:43,900
Nie Chi.

226
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,300
You're not going?

227
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,260
Isn't 500m your main event?

228
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,500
Nie!

229
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,260
Are you okay?

230
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:35,100
I'm fine.

231
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,900
Same as usual.

232
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,410
The last person

233
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,060
will do 300 push-ups
and run 10 kilometers.

234
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,180
- Go.
- Why did you do this?

235
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,940
You couldn't beat him,

236
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,420
so you played dirty, huh?

237
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,420
Don't slander me.

238
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,660
Did you see that?

239
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,740
Well,

240
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,020
you hit my bro,
so I'm going to hit you back.

241
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:57,900
Hit me?

242
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,880
Nie Chi, are you a sore loser?

243
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,200
Don't argue with a reptile.

244
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,520
- What did you say?
- Who are you referring to?

245
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,360
Who's a reptile?

246
00:14:10,330 --> 00:14:11,190
What to fight?

247
00:14:11,190 --> 00:14:12,240
- What are you doing?
- Stop!

248
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,380
Get off me!

249
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
What are you doing?

250
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:25,260
How dare you?

251
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,220
Do you want to be expelled?

252
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,180
Anyone involved in the fight

253
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,540
will be fined two months' allowance.

254
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,180
Who started it?

255
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,060
Come over!

256
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,060
Go back.

257
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,420
You'll be fined

258
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,500
three months' allowance.

259
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:12,300
Coach, is that enough?

260
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,340
Disagree?

261
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,540
No!

262
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:20,300
I just don't want to be fined.

263
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,940
Is this your first year on the team?

264
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,020
I'm sorry.

265
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,300
You've been the team leader
for a long time.

266
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:31,420
How could you start a fight?

267
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,820
Is this how you

268
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,580
train the newcomers and solve problems?

269
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:35,760
Coach,

270
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,110
please give me another chance.

271
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:40,410
I won't mess it up again.

272
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,270
Please don't fine me.

273
00:15:43,830 --> 00:15:46,140
You know my family's condition.

274
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,780
You can punish me

275
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,060
as you want.

276
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:51,660
You have half a month.

277
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,060
No problem.

278
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,500
Nie Chi and you must learn to cooperate,

279
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,260
or you'll lose the money.

280
00:15:58,540 --> 00:15:59,380
No problem.

281
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,820
No problem.

282
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,300
200 more push-ups.

283
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,140
Okay.

284
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,540
Don't slack off.

285
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,260
Where are you doing?

286
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,260
Having lunch?

287
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,500
What do you want?

288
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,020
We can eat together. It's on me.

289
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,420
No.

290
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:31,500
What do you mean?

291
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,180
You get type I meals,

292
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:34,300
but we get type II meals.

293
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,420
We can't eat together.

294
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,020
(I'm not surprised the seniors)

295
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,180
- (don't like Nie Chi.)
- Fang Chao.

296
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:42,130
- (He hates)
- I didn't mean it.

297
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,240
(seniority culture and factionalism.)

298
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,280
I'm a man.

299
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,650
- (In his eyes,)
- It's okay.

300
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:47,820
(it's just a waste of time.)

301
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:51,060
(It's hard for outsiders to tell)

302
00:16:51,650 --> 00:16:52,940
(whether he's arrogant or shy.)

303
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,300
(He knows I don't want to give up,)

304
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,180
(and I know it's hard for him
to express his feelings.)

305
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,500
(It's time to return the favor.)

306
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,780
Can you find a way

307
00:17:04,780 --> 00:17:06,620
to make up with Huang Han?

308
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,300
I heard what happened in the sauna

309
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,380
and the ice rink.

310
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:10,700
You've become enemies.

311
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,620
We're new here,

312
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,340
and we tried so hard to stay.

313
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:16,060
Don't let it affect your future.

314
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,580
If you think it's embarrassing,

315
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,100
I can talk to him.

316
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:23,100
Lin Ge, I know what you mean,

317
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,300
but I know what I'm doing.

318
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,730
I'm not good at socializing.

319
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,260
I even hate the superficial brotherhood

320
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,860
because of my parents.

321
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,420
I chose to be an athlete

322
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,460
not only because

323
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:37,620
I love skating

324
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,340
but because I think
an athlete's life is simpler.

325
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,300
As for Huang Han,

326
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,380
I don't have to solve the problem now.

327
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,660
I admit,

328
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,380
to some extent, I'm avoiding it.

329
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,580
However, given the situation,

330
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,220
I think I'll be more upset
to make friends

331
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,780
with someone I hate.

332
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,380
So,

333
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,300
you want to handle it yourself.

334
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,620
You don't need my help, right?

335
00:18:02,420 --> 00:18:03,260
That's right.

336
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,940
Got it.

337
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:07,900
Sometimes,

338
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,900
I can't control myself.

339
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,450
So, it depends.

340
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,380
Zhou Yao,

341
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,620
can you help me

342
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,540
ask Huang Han
about his plan for the day off?

343
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,180
Why?

344
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:32,540
I'm going to get him.

345
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,580
Are you crazy?

346
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,140
When did your taste change?

347
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:38,940
I want to be his friend.

348
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,860
Please help me.

349
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,580
Harder.

350
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,060
Your lipstick looks so good.

351
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,860
Fine, I'll ask him.

352
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:49,770
Look.

353
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,780
Flower market?

354
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,500
Miss, how much is a bouquet?

355
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:19,020
What kind of bouquet?

356
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:19,860
A gift?

357
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,740
For my sister's birthday.

358
00:19:22,270 --> 00:19:24,120
- (Isn't it for Zhu?)
- It's 180 yuan.

359
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,900
Are the petals and stems

360
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,140
made of gold?

361
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,100
So expensive.

362
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,060
Apart from the flowers,

363
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,580
I need to use wrapping paper, ribbon,

364
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,990
- (It's a fraud.)
- and preservative.

365
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,340
You can ask around.

366
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,820
I'm offering the lowest price.

367
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,040
I'd like a bouquet.

368
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,140
- Wait a minute.
- Okay.

369
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,730
Miss, we'll look around.

370
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,860
Follow me.

371
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,940
Well,

372
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,060
it's less than 80 yuan.

373
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,780
She wanted to charge you 180 yuan.

374
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,900
So cunning.

375
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:57,740
It's good.

376
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,180
Then write on this card.

377
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,860
My handwriting is terrible.

378
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,340
I don't want to

379
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,300
embarrass my sister
and make her regret it.

380
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,180
Can you help me?

381
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,980
You don't understand.

382
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,220
It doesn't matter.

383
00:20:19,230 --> 00:20:20,620
It's about love.

384
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,860
When she grows up

385
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,180
and sees this card,

386
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,660
she'll definitely be moved to tears.

387
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:25,940
Really?

388
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:26,810
Yes.

389
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:29,900
Then I'll write it.

390
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:36,740
(Dear sister...)

391
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,820
I'm bad at studying,

392
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,820
but she's a good student.

393
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,580
Her teacher said
she'd definitely get into

394
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:47,620
a key university if she works hard.

395
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,780
I've been saving money

396
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,180
for her education.

397
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,740
(Your brother)

398
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,860
Han,

399
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,900
you invited Nie Chi
and Fang Chao to lunch.

400
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:04,740
You're not angry anymore, right?

401
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,740
As a senior brother,

402
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,980
I need to be tolerant.

403
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:11,260
Besides,

404
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,780
the fight was not just his fault.

405
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
If he behaves himself,

406
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,140
I won't give him a hard time.

407
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,180
Yes. He's a good guy,

408
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,420
- so are you.
- Yes.

409
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,740
You just don't know

410
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,580
each other.

411
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:25,980
- Yes.
- I have an idea.

412
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,300
Maybe you can make up.

413
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,900
What is it?

414
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,420
But I have one condition.

415
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,900
What?

416
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,740
Han,

417
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:39,260
you gave him a hard time on purpose,

418
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,380
didn't you?

419
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,420
Yes.

420
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:46,950
So, you need to apologize first.

421
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,300
A sincere apology.

422
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,540
And I'll help you.

423
00:21:49,550 --> 00:21:50,540
Why should I?

424
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,580
What about mutual respect?

425
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:53,740
He embarrassed me first.

426
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,420
Why should I say sorry?

427
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,020
He should apologize first.

428
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,180
Stop.

429
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,900
Don't take the flowers away.

430
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,960
Do you accept it?

431
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,420
Fine.

432
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,620
I'll do it.

433
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:11,860
It's just an apology.

434
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,860
Not a big deal.

435
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,860
You promise?

436
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:16,050
How about a pinky swear?

437
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:25,100
Find a place to have fun?

438
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,660
I was born to do this.

439
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:28,820
Okay.

440
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,100
Don't worry about it.

441
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,860
I'll arrange everything.

442
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,380
At least I'm a local.

443
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,300
What's the point

444
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,420
of hanging out?

445
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,100
I'll forgive them.

446
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,500
He said he'd apologize.

447
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,560
Just give him a chance.

448
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,620
It won't harm you.

449
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:45,860
If it goes well,
you'll have more friends.

450
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,180
Yes. Don't you trust me?

451
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,940
I'll try.

452
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,100
Don't just try.

453
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:55,660
You just need to speak more than usual.

454
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:56,980
You're always quiet,

455
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,740
so they think you're indifferent.

456
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,380
Besides, you look like

457
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,740
you have no shortcomings.

458
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,900
I do.

459
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,420
I'm bad at socializing.

460
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,380
That's why

461
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:08,540
they got you wrong.

462
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,100
Is there anything else you're bad at?

463
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:13,300
Just expose some small shortcomings.

464
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,900
Does singing out of tone count?

465
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,140
Out of tone?

466
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,860
How?

467
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:21,940
I don't know.

468
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,740
I think it's fine,

469
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,540
but people laugh at me.

470
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,660
Me too!

471
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,100
We're the same.

472
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,810
You're both tone-deaf?

473
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:32,020
You just need to sing in front of them,

474
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,620
and I'll dance for you.

475
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,340
Will it work?

476
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,300
Will Huang Han see me differently

477
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:38,420
just because I'm tone-deaf?

478
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,980
Trust me, he will.

479
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,130
Fine. Just arrange it.

480
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,820
Please come with us.

481
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:53,420
I'm so scared of awkward silence.

482
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:55,500
This mask cost me 16.8 yuan.

483
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,820
Why would I play with

484
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,620
a bunch of kids tomorrow
after applying it

485
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,580
tonight?

486
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:00,900
Not all kids.

487
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,980
Huang Han will be there.

488
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,300
No way.

489
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:05,620
I'm begging you.

490
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,900
Please come.

491
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:08,740
No.

492
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,740
Where are you going?

493
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,140
Fang Chao booked a place.

494
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:13,100
He's keeping a secret.

495
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:13,940
I don't know either.

496
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,500
Zhu, if you have time,

497
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,620
you can join us.

498
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,940
Who will be there?

499
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,620
Nie Chi, Fang Chao, Huang Han, and me.

500
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,820
Well, we just want to

501
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,860
help Huang Han and Nie Chi
to make up with each other.

502
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,820
If you don't want to...

503
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,730
Fine. I'll come.

504
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,100
What?

505
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,100
Did I hear that right?

506
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:47,820
She said she'd come.

507
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,820
Does that mean she'll come with us?

508
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,100
I think so.

509
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,140
What about you?

510
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,340
I'll come.

511
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,060
But I need to take someone.

512
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:01,220
Who?

513
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,080
It hurts.

514
00:25:04,620 --> 00:25:05,460
Here.

515
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,820
My eyes.

516
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:09,100
This facial mask is killing me.

517
00:25:14,490 --> 00:25:16,380
What do you usually do

518
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,540
before you go out?

519
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:18,860
What took you so long?

520
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,100
Just wait.

521
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,420
She's here.

522
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:34,980
Let's go.

523
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,380
What's wrong with you?

524
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,500
What?

525
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,380
Lin Ge, what happened?

526
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:44,060
What are you

527
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,540
dressing up like this?

528
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,540
The apron

529
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:48,820
and the hat.

530
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,900
Are you going to slaughter pigs
in the kitchen?

531
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,780
Hey, watch your language.

532
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,820
This is vintage fashion.

533
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:55,260
Shut up. You know nothing.

534
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,960
I can't stand it anyway.

535
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:57,800
Oh my god.

536
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,580
Do I look bad?

537
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,740
You look good.

538
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:02,850
Gosh, it's really good.

539
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,820
Oh, you're stunning.

540
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:05,900
Nie Chi, what do you think?

541
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,200
It's too good to watch.

542
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,960
Your boyfriend is waiting for you.

543
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:10,990
Let's go.

544
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,800
Yes. Let's go.

545
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,420
Lin Ge,

546
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,540
your long johns are coming out.

547
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,360
Fang Chao, you want to be beaten?

548
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,820
Fan Hong!

549
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,380
Let me introduce him.

550
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:32,900
This is my boyfriend Fan Hong.

551
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,300
He used to be on our team.

552
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,050
Hello, I'm Fang Chao.

553
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:38,420
- Hello.
- Hello, I'm Nie Chi.

554
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,700
Hello.

555
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:41,340
Hi, Yao's boyfriend, I'm Lin Ge.

556
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,580
Yao's boyfriend?

557
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,660
What

558
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,900
a smart girl.

559
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,180
Exactly.

560
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:50,020
Today is all about improving
his emotional intelligence.

561
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,140
Huang Han has poor EQ too.

562
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,580
What time is it?

563
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,580
Where is he?

564
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,840
I'll call him.

565
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,180
I think I just saw him.

566
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,660
I was wondering what he was doing.

567
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,340
It turns out he styled his hair

568
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:16,340
like a feather duster.

569
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,340
We're having a good time.

570
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,980
Don't mess with me.

571
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,180
Fang Chao!

572
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,780
Is this the place you chose

573
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,100
as a local?

574
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,300
I looked it up online.

575
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,580
This place is fun.

576
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:01,620
Which part?

577
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,060
Picnic and barbecue!

578
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,140
Barbecue?

579
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,500
We have to get in first!

580
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,900
For the barbecue!

581
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,340
Go!

582
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,100
Who will share a bike?

583
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,140
Tell me now.

584
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,980
What are you doing?

585
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,100
Are you isolating me?

586
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,780
I want to ride alone.

587
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,580
Why don't you share a bike
with Fang Chao?

588
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,060
You'll be tired and lonely

589
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,180
if you ride alone.

590
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,500
I can ride,

591
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:31,660
- Nie.
- and you can rest.

592
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,820
You can also enjoy the view.

593
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,620
I just want to ride alone.

594
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,140
Zhu, why don't we share a bike?

595
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,380
Wait, what are you doing?

596
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,340
Han, you can ride with Nie Chi.

597
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,420
We're both men.

598
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,420
It's awkward.

599
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:47,340
Don't forget your promise.

600
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:50,500

602
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,260
It seems you got

603
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:04,970

No need. My meat is cooked.

647
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,220
Cooked?

648
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,490
Give it to me.

649
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,380
It's for Lin Ge.

650
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,320
Don't waste time.

651
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:26,420

No.

Nie Chi just made it.

655
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
He wanted to keep it.

656
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,820

It's good.

666
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,900
Just a bit salty.

667
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,620
Is the salt free?

668
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,620
Stop doing this.

669
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,340
Less salt, more caring.

I didn't ask you to do that.

673
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,340
It was for Lin Ge.

674
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,820
Why didn't you tell me it was cooked?

675
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,380
Why are you so stingy?

676
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,860
Does it taste a little...?

677
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:41,820

678
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:44,020

But it doesn't matter.

754
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,420
I'll have your back.

755
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,780
Thank you.

756
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:33,430
That's great.

757
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:35,220
Let's continue.

758
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,470
Let me lose.

759
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,780
I also want to sing.

760
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,060
- Come on.
- Okay.

761
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:41,980
Rock, paper, scissors.

762
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:44,580
Hurry, I took him down.

763
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,420
Hurry.

764
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,060
- Is this necessary?
- Of course.

765
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:48,180
You're like strangers.

766
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,030
Take a photo to show

767
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,220
the coach you've made up.

768
00:35:50,220 --> 00:35:51,780
Come on. Let's take a photo.

769
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,940
- We're friends now.
- Come on.

770
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:55,060
- Hong, take a photo for us.
- Okay. Come on.

771
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,490
Three, two, one.

772
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:18,620
Look good?

773
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:21,210
Yes.

774
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,320
Do you like it?

775
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:27,420
Yes.

776
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,640
Me too.

777
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,140
(Songbei Provincial Ice Sports Base)

778
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,060
I need to think about

779
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:47,460
the arrangement of the women's team.

780
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:49,540
Let's follow the training schedule
for now.

781
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,260
Coach.

782
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,500
Who will help Lin Ge with the traction?

783
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,620
Lin Feng, step forward.

784
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,300
Hurry.

785
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:09,580
You'll do basic training with Lin Ge,

786
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,380
with 1.5 times her training load.

787
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,780
Coach, I have good foundations.

788
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,020
You were good when you just came here.

789
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,300
However, everyone else has made progress

790
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:23,460
except for you.

791
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,620
How far can you glide on one foot
in a turn?

792
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,780
Can you master narrow stride?

793
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:29,100
Don't want to practice?

794
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,700
Fine. You can go home.

795
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,500
Girls, let's start training.

796
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:36,940
Hurry up.

797
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,980
Boys, let's go to the ice rink.

798
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,100
