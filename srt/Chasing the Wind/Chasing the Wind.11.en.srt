Nie Chi.

28

It can bless you.

That way you won't get hurt.

00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,120
I saw Zhu Zhu.

How has she been?

33
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:48,690
Let's hang out on our rest day.

34
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,170
Just you and me.

35
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,400
Who can't do that?

36
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:53,050
Don't spend money.

37
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,480
Let me tell you in person.

38
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,450
Emphasize it.

39
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,050
Emphasize it again and again.

40
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,760
Thanks to your whole family,

41
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:03,200

=Where Did the Jealousy Come From?=

43
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,760
You buy a screen protector again?

44
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,200
I'm carrying so many things.

45
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,170
Can you help me with it?

46
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,760
Who let you waste your money?

47
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,480
You help me paste the protector

48
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,680
this time, huh?

49
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,890
Ok, I'll paste it after opening the package.

50
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:34,130
The Father of Positive Psychology Seligman...

51
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,960
Why is he studying psychology?

52
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,170
He is negative.

53
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
What is this?

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,570
What are Nie and Ms. Han going to do?

55
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,760
Is he criticized again?

56
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,330
He has been doing well recently.

57
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:53,730
It's my fault.

58
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:56,200
I couldn't find your problem earlier.

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,570
How could it be your fault?

60
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:00,130
Mr. Li

61
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,450
discovered my problem

62
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,570
after the Huarong Cup.

63
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,730
I think

64
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,570
current domestic Grand Prix

65
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,050
does not mean much to your problem.

66
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:11,410
From 500m qualifications to finals,

67
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:12,640
you have been in the lead.

68
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,850
Unless you try long distances.

69
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,520
But with your endurance,

70
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,480
you can't maintain a lead all the way.

71
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,850
I've never skated a long distance.

72
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,960
I can't joke about the reputation

73
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,520
of the provincial team and yours.

74
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:29,330
You think too thoughtfully about everything.

75
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,410
What does this have to do with you?

76
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:33,760
This is something coaches should think about.

77
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,360
Just think about yourself.

78
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:41,480
Ms. Han, I'm not a kid anymore.

79
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,450
Let me ask you a question.

80
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:45,050
Can you answer me directly?

81
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:46,850
Go ahead.

82
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,080
How long do you think Mr. Li will keep me?

83
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,050
If they finish the competition

84
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,290
and you still haven't improved,

85
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,360
it's not good.

86
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,050
Why are you here?

87
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,850
I was eavesdropping.

88
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,120
I heard Ms. Han say

89
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,880
the Grand Prix doesn't mean much to you.

90
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,570
Let me ask you.

91
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,760
In our team,

92
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,970
who do you think

93
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:33,090
are good enough

94
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,440
that you can't find a flaw in their skills

95
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,920
and can overtake them

96
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,090
only by courage

97
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,090
and a little chance?

98
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:41,890
Gao Kai.

99
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,200
That's all?

100
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:48,920
The premise is that he's willing to slow down.

101
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,320
Or I can't catch up with him.

102
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,880
Ok, then I'll go beg him

103
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,290
and let him be your training partner.

104
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,530
You don't have to. I'll beg him myself.

105
00:04:57,850 --> 00:04:58,920
Let me go with you.

106
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,360
Gao Kai is quite kind to me.

107
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,720
No need.

108
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,970
Why?

109
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,170
I don't want you to owe him a favor.

110
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,440
Don't worry.

111
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,320
I know the priorities.

112
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,050
I'll try again.

113
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:14,800
I need to make progress in speaking.

114
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:18,480
Ok, I believe you this time.

115
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,450
Well...

116
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,170
What did you do with Fang Chao today?

117
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,850
Women's Day is coming soon.

118
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,120
Did you buy a present for your mom?

119
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:35,000
My allowance can't afford half of her purse.

120
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,970
Even if you buy her a leaf,

121
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,920
she'll treat it as a treasure.

122
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:42,000
Do you understand?

123
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,770
Understood.

124
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,000
Buy her a leaf.

125
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,090
Is that what I mean?

126
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,950
You are such a filial son.

127
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:53,050
The Grand Prix is finished so fast.

128
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,120
You have to leave again.

129
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,240
It's ok, Zhou Yao.

130
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,920
I'll come back to see you during the holiday.

131
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,440
Not only during the holidays,

132
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,320
you must contact me every day.

133
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,000
Ok, I promise you.

134
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:05,480
But don't think I'm annoying.

135
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,400
I won't.

136
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,120
Ok, Zhou Yao,

137
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,440
you stop here. We're going.

138

Rest assured.

140
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,450
You go ahead.

00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,530
Me too.

189
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,240
I have watched it. So great!

190
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,080
Really?

191
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:31,570
Where's your bracelet?

192
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,960
Let me take you to eat.

193
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,770
Gao Kai is there.

194
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,410
How about I help you ask him?

195
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,920
No rush.

196
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,440
I'll go by myself.

197
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,720
Can you do it yourself?

198
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,560
Indeed.

199
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,680
I'll try it.

200
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,320
You must have a good attitude.

201
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,290
Do you know?

202
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,680
Come on.

203
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,250
Why am I so uneasy?

204
00:09:02,770 --> 00:09:03,610
Let's wait.

205
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,530
Leader, I have something to talk to you.

206
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,920
I just sat down.

207
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,200
Can I take my breath

208
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,210
and have something to eat?

209
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,680
Say something.

210
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:29,370
This soup is delicious. I'll get some more.

211
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,290
You can ignore me.

212
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,010
After you take a breath and finish eating,

213
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,130
I will beg you again.

214
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,050
After you take a breath?

215
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,800
He must be looking for trouble.

216
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,760
Sit down.

217
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,290
I won't sit.

218
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,050
It's more sincere when I stand up.

219
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,490
Leader,

220
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,530
I want you to practice overtaking with me.

221
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,230
Don't you need my help?

222
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,200
I had a bad attitude before.

223
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,960
You didn't have a bad attitude.

224
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:18,900
You were just honest.

225
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,650
We are teammates and opponents.

226
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,490
Understand?

227
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,310
Understood.

228
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,560
If I practice with you,

229
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,800
it's like to teach you how to deal with me.

230
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,440
Do you think I would agree?

231
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:48,610
I don't know.

232
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,560
But except begging you,

233
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,720
I have no other way.

234
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,050
Other players

235
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,800
can accompany me to practice too.

236
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,960
But practicing with you

237
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,530
is the closest to actual combats.

238
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:02,370
Your strength is at the top.

239
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,490
That sounds quite comfortable.

240
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,250
Then tell me

241
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,920
what you can offer me.

242
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,010
Nothing.

243
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,370
You are asking me for help.

244
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,560
Don't you have to offer me something?

245
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,290
Aren't your parents businessmen?

246
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,250
Why don't you inherit it from them at all?

247
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:26,050
What do you want from me?

248
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:33,130
Show me some respect in the future.

249
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,440
You have never called me senior, huh?

250
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:38,010
Isn't it more respectful to call Leader?

251
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,890
Being a leader is temporary.

252
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,530
Calling me senior can show your sincerity.

253
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,800
Call me senior from now on.

254
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,010
Did you hear that?

255
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,080
I heard you, Leader.

256
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,080
As for the training matter,

257
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,250
I'll talk to the coach.

258
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:59,010
The specific arrangement depends on him.

259
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,720
If he agrees,

260
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:03,640
I'll practice with you very hard.

261
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,610
Thank you, Leader.

262
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,680
Senior.

263
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,440
Go back to eat.

264
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,600
What's wrong?

265
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,770
You're different after being the leader.

266
00:12:57,410 --> 00:12:58,370
You have a big picture now.

267
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:01,560
What is the big picture?

268
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,920
Mentoring.

269
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,130
We can't be counted on for 2022.

270
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,960
We will be veterans by then.

271
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,200
I'll be 28 in 2022.

272
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,650
Is it old?

273
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:16,890
I'll be 30.

274
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,610
I am old.

275
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,840
Come on. Do you really think you're old?

276
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,920
What I think is not important.

277
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,490
Athletes have their own career cycle.

278
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:37,200
Only a very few people are the exception.

279
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,320
I am the exception.

280
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,770
Mentoring is a coach's matter.

281
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,800
The reason I help Nie Chi

282
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,410
is because his skills and tactics are good.

283
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,050
It's also comfortable to work with him.

284
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,530
With him on the field,

285
00:13:53,890 --> 00:13:55,560
I can also have fewer worries.

286
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:01,200
When we got back,

287
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:05,250
I heard the coach making a call,

288
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,890
asking them to put Nie's results on the desk.

289
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,520
I know

290
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,560
the coach doesn't give up Nie Chi.

291
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,840
Even if Nie Chi didn't come to me,

292
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,530
the coach would let me help him.

293
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,330
Instead,

294
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,720
I might as well say yes first.

295
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,650
It's not a big deal anyway.

296
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,050
That is what you really think.

297
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,440
Maybe.

298
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,920
Didn't you see such a big flaw?

299
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,040
One more time.

300
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,490
All right.

301
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,170
Several 500m.

302
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:52,560
That's all for today.

303
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:54,920
Nie Chi,

304
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,130
he has to get ready for a competition.

305
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
His time is limited
to being a training partner.

306
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,800
But have you ever thought

307
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,960
about if it is a shame

308
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,800
that you take him as a lead skater?

309
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,920
You are distracted again?

310
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,490
Continue.

311
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,770
I'm so exhausted.

312
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,720
Why are you so tired?

313
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,490
Did the coach add you some intensity?

314
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:32,770
Never mention it.

315
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:34,200
I was distracted in the afternoon

316
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,770
and watched you train with Gao Kai.

317
00:15:36,010 --> 00:15:37,130
Jinting and Mr. Wang

318
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,960
made me practice hard this afternoon.

319
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:41,320
I am so tired that I can hardly lift my legs.

320
00:15:43,290 --> 00:15:45,010
What's so great about training

321
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:46,320
that it distracts you?

322
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,680
I have a question.

323
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,800
In the last lap,

324
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,800
I noticed Gao Kai took his feet off the gas.

325
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,010
Maybe he didn't control the route well.

326
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,200
Anyway, it was a good opportunity.

327
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,200
Why didn't you overtake him?

328
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,130
Gao Kai was too fast.

329
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:01,410
And the flaw he revealed was fleeting.

330
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,010
He is a top athlete

331
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:05,170
and is able to adjust his route quickly.

332
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,960
If I forcibly overtook him,

333
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:09,200
we would collide.

334
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,210
Nie,

335
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,080
during the time you did your analysis,

336
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,440
you've already overtaken him.

337
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,250
Lin Ge,

338
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,410
if it hurts, then go to bed quickly.

339
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:33,650
It won't hurt when you fall asleep.

340
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:37,530
My brain is full of things.

341
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,600
I can't fall asleep.

342
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,890
I don't know what you are thinking every day.

343
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:44,580
You go to bed first.

344
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,300
I'll think about it again.

345
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,940
Then I'm going to sleep.

346
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,620
You sent me a WeChat message at 3 a.m.

347
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,980
Normally, people are sleeping.

348
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:17,330
Does your leg still hurt?

349
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,940
Yes. It hurts very much.

350
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,980
- You...
- Don't interrupt.

351
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:23,900
I'm here to talk to you about business.

352
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,860
What's the business?

353
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,220
Let me ask you a question.

354
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,220
In a competition,

355
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,300
do you always imagine

356
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:32,220
your opponent will try their best to stop you

357
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,220
and have a collision with you?

358
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:34,860
Yeah.

359
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,260
Wrong. This is common people's thinking.

360
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,500
Real masters would not do this.

361
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,650
The higher the level of a real master,

362
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,960
the better the avoidance skills.

363
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,300
Everyone wants to win the championship.

364
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,020
No one wants to fight desperately.

365
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,540
As long as any opportunity arises,

366
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,060
you have to overtake them bravely.

367
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,820
In a narrow path, the brave will win.

368
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,220
These are just your own imaginations.

369
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,380
There is no theoretical basis at all.

370
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,460
What if we collide

371
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,300
when I overtake them?

372
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:01,300
You have to trust a woman's sixth sense.

373
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:03,060
Believe me. You can make it.

374
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,940
What sixth sense?

375
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,340
Does the leg hurt?

376
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,980
Do you believe me or not?

377
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,180
I believe you.

378
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:16,540
If it hurts, you still have to see a doctor.

379
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:18,740
I feel better after saying it.

380
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,420
It doesn't hurt?

381
00:18:21,580 --> 00:18:23,060
It doesn't hurt at all.

382
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,700
Gao Kai is really excellent.

383
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,820
He's such a poser.

384
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,140
He even adjusted his goggles.

385
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,580
Nie Chi took the initiative to speed up.

386
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,780
Speed up... Hurry up.

387
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,060
Gao Kai's accelerating swinging his arms.

388
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,580
They're getting faster and faster.

389
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
He finally takes it seriously.

390
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,060
Gao Kai, speed up.

391
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,740
Nie Chi, speed up.

392
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,900
He did it!

393
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,060
He won!

394
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,700
What are you so excited about him winning?

395
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:54,020
Next group,

396
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,140
Fang Chao, Chen Mingyuan.

397
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,700
Nie can stay now.

398
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,540
I'm very happy. It's a great event.

399
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,100
How about we celebrate it?

400
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,860
Definitely.

401
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,780
It's not determined.

402
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,820
You overtook so many people this afternoon.

403
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,860
You even overtook Gao Kai three times.

404
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,300
What have you got to worry about?

405
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,860
Do you have any confidence?

406
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,260
Then let me treat you in the canteen.

407
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,540
In the canteen?

408
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,500
This is really unnecessary.

409
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,780
- Indeed.
- Fine, let's dine out.

410
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,300
Anyway, we'll rest tomorrow.

411
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,940
I'll go to Mr. Wang to ask for leave.

412
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,980
All right.

413
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:53,220
Then you go first.

414
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,300
I'll go back and take a shower. See you.

415
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,260
Little Gold, what are you doing?

416
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,780
Don't call me by my nickname.

417
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:09,100
Nie Chi has gone so far.

418
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:12,020
What are you still looking at him?

419
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,540
Why did you skate so fast today?

420
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,380
I didn't like someone clinging to me

421
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,540
behind my back.

422
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:25,500
I tried to keep the distance apart.

423
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:29,740
You didn't expect Nie Chi to follow you, huh?

424
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,500
We're going to train.

425
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:34,300
He can't be idle either.

426
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,980
Are you crazy?

427
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,140
You competed with our seniors at first.

428
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:41,060
Later, you competed with yourself.

429
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,140
You are going too far right now.

430
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,820
You started to compete with a junior.

431
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:47,540
He'll take a long time to catch up with you.

432
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:48,940
I know.

433
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,580
But why are you still so stubborn?

434
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,060
Why do you like gossiping so much?

435
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,700
Can you die if you don't gossip?

436
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,540
I just skated a little faster.

437
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,940
But you come up with so many thoughts.

438
00:21:57,980 --> 00:22:01,140
Fine. Continue to be a poser.

439
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:04,740
Putting yourself on the table

440
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:05,820
will exhaust you.

441
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,660
I kick...

442
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,140
This one is not good.

443
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,460
Nor this one.

444
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,500
Oh my God, Lin Ge,

445
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:29,100
what are you doing?

446
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,020
Wei, can I have a look at your clothes?

447
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,300
Go ahead.

448
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,500
Wei, why are all your clothes sportswear?

449
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,380
Sportswear is comfortable.

450
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,540
I suddenly miss

451
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,860
the fancy clothes

452
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:52,780
of my mates in the provincial team.

453
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:54,460
What's so good about fancy clothes?

454
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,140
The most comfortable clothes are sportswear.

455
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,460
My mom likes me

456
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,940
wearing those fancy clothes.

457
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:00,460
I'm forced to wear it every time I go back.

458
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:03,620
I don't think those clothes are anything

459
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,780
but pretty.

460
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,820
Wei, it's ok as long as it looks good.

461
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,340
Looking good is the most important.

462
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,980
Is he already waiting for me?

463
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,100
Lin Ge,

464
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,100
who do you want to show you?

465
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,980
No one.

466
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,300
I'm talking about it casually.

467
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,820
That's it.

468
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,060
Look at it.

469
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:37,780
Wei. Lin Ge.

470
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,220
Come here. Show you something.

471
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,500
Come here.

472
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,100
Prince Charming.

473
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:43,300
Quick, let's show you something.

474
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,220
I entrust Wei to you.

475
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:47,620
Wei, have dinner with them together later.

476
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,780
I put the vitamins on your table.

477
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,140
Remember to eat. I'll go first.

478
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,620
Don't hurry to leave.

479
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,260
- Don't leave.
- Come here.

480
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,260
- Come here.
- Watch it together.

481
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,260
- Well, I...
- Come on.

482
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,060
It's so wonderful.

483
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,060
What's so wonderful?

484
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,100
You play it from the beginning.

485
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,820
Very wonderful.

486
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:04,420
(I ship them.)

487
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:08,380
(So sweet!)

488
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,140
Look at his eyes.

489
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:12,580
Look at his eyes. He smiled.

490
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,340
My goodness.

491
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:24,300
What the hell is it?

492
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,460
See?

493
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,460
He looked at you with deep affection.

494
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,460
With a smile.

495
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,300
With love.

496
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:32,060
Nonsense.

497
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:34,020
Can you stop talking nonsense?

498
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,820
It's much better than idol drama. Look.

499
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,300
- Exactly.
- Oh, my God!

500
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,860
- Stop it!
- Watch it.

501
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:48,240
I don't have anything with Nie Chi.

502
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,820
- That's not necessarily true.
- Yes.

503
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,060
Lin Ge, tell them

504
00:24:51,060 --> 00:24:52,700
I'm always with you.

505
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,620
I have nothing to do with Nie Chi.

506
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,700
Yeah.

507
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,340
In fact, we all know.

508
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:00,340
Isn't this just a piece of our life?

509
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,820
We can see that.

510
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,460
Why do you ask me to watch this video?

511
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,780
Have some fun.

512
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,780
It's my first time to watch

513
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,780
- such a video.
- That's right.

514
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:09,780
How wonderful!

515
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,500
Then they're too boring.

516
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,780
You treat Nie Chi as a friend.

517
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,540
Maybe he really likes you.

518
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,940
- Yeah.
- This video with the music.

519
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,500
You really look like a couple.

520
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,220
- Idol drama.
- Yes.

521
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,020
Lin Ge. Lin Ge.

522
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,540
You know Nie Chi well.

523
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:26,990
Do you think
there'll be a spark between them?

524
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,220
Is there?

525
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,220
- Yeah.
- Of course.

526
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,060
Definitely.

527
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,780
You treat Nie Chi as a friend.

528
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,500
Maybe he really likes you.

529
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:37,700
Lin Ge, do you think
there'll be a spark between them?

530
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:41,540
The eyes of the masses are sharp.

531
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,140
(I think I'm a cheery person.)

532
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,220
(But if it's about Nie Chi and Xie Lingwei,)

533
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,300
(I'll come up with many thoughts.)

534
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:21,540
(I think it must be because)

535
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,460
(friends can't be jealous in the open.)

536
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,620
(I mind that they have a better relationship.)

537
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:30,060
(How sentimental I am.)

538
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,540
(But in the national team,)

539
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,340
(I never dare to go)

540
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:37,540
(into where the jealousy comes from?)

541
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,540
(Release and send)
I feel so tired.

542
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,740
You guys go.

543
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,100
(Fang Chao)

544
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,580
I suddenly feel a little tired.

545
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,860
You guys go.

546
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,980
Leave me alone.

547
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,340
(Fang Chao)

548
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:06,780
He looked at you with deep affection.

549
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:07,740
With a smile.

550
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,700
With love.

551
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,540
The eyes of the masses are sharp.

552
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,260
(National Ice Sports Base)

553
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,540
Coming.

554
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,220
Where's Lin Ge?

555
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,060
Lin Ge fell asleep.

556
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,500
She was asleep when I came back.

557
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,460
I don't know how

558
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,980
to turn off the lights this evening.

559
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:57,290
The light can't be connected to the phone?

560
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,300
It's been broken for days.

561
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,620
I didn't remember to replace it.

562
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,940
Lin Ge. Lin Ge.

563
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,060
Are you sick?

564
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,020
Why are you going to bed so early?

565
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:16,820
Lin Ge.

566
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:18,900
Lin Ge.

567
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:20,380
I'm not sick.

568
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,580
I'm just a little tired.

569
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:59,220
(Room 306)

570
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,460
How is it? Is it hot?

571
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,140
It's a little hot.

572
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:06,100
Do you have a thermometer in your dorm?

573
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,620
Yeah.

574
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,940
I can't find it.

575
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,060
I'd better take you to the doctor.

576
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,700
I'm really fine.

577
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,580
Leave me alone.

578
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,060
Let me sleep.

579
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:39,880
This is a fever-reducing medicine.

580
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,380
If she's still not feeling well,

581
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,700
just go to the doctor.

582
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,540
How much does she need to take at a time?

583
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,900
It is written on the box.

584
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:51,620
I'm going.

585
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,300
(Room 306)

586
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,140
Chao.

587
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:08,540
Let's go.

588
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:16,700
Lin Ge, why did you suddenly get sick?

589
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,740
I'm fine, just a little tired.

590
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,340
If you need something, just tell me.

591
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,060
What's wrong with you?

592
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,740
Why don't you speak?

593
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,060
Lin Ge isn't going to dinner.

594
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,740
Let's not go either.

595
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,980
That's all?

596
00:30:57,740 --> 00:30:58,940
Let's go another day.

597
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:05,700
Nie Chi.

598
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,540
Let me discuss something with you.

599
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,420
Go ahead.

600
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,020
As for Lin Ge's birthday gifts this year,

601
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,820
we don't buy together.

602
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,020
Let's buy separately.

603
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,060
Why?

604
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,060
It's her 18th birthday.

605
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,300
I want to buy her something alone.

606
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,500
Ok.

607
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,620
I'll go to the canteen.

608
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,060
Send me a message about what you want to eat.

609
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,820
Why are there so many people watching it?

610
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:57,020
(A powerful couple. I like them.)

611
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:06,780
Lin Ge.

612
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,620
What are you watching?

613
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,340
I am watching the news.

614
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,340
News?

615
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,220
What's good about the news?

616
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:17,810
Let me see if my delivery has arrived.

617
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:21,860
Xie Lingwei.

618
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,060
I bought them yesterday. They are adjusted.

619
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,900
Thank you.

620
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:32,580
Install an app on your phone.

621
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:34,460
No need. Shan has installed it.

622
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,220
It's not the same brand. Need a new app.

623
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,260
Oh no. I forgot something.

624
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,260
Help me download it.

625
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:39,380
The password is 2222.

626
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,100
Lin Ge. Lin Ge.

627
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,140
What?

628
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,780
What happened to you these days?

629
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:47,060
Did I make you angry somewhere?

630
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,900
Nothing.

631
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,780
But you're clearly angry.

632
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:53,820
Lin Ge.

633
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,100
Yes, I'm angry.

634
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,140
But you didn't annoy me.

635
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:01,940
I don't understand.

636
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,700
I can't say it clearly either.

637
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,100
I didn't annoy you.

638
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,940
Are you angry with me

639
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:13,780
because of someone else's business?

640
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,860
It's about the same.

641
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:17,200
That's it. But I can't control it.

642
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,140
When I was leaving,

643
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:20,100
you were so anxious

644
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:21,460
and tried to help me.

645
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,580
The team hasn't decided to keep me.

646
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,580
You start to not cherish me.

647
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,060
There are many people who cherish you.

648
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,980
You cherish more than just me.

649
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,300
The password is 2222.

650
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,820
Install the bulb after downloading the app.
