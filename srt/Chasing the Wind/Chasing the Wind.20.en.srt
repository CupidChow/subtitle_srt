Well,

50
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,410
I don't know what you like,

51
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,680
so I bought that.

52
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,570
I remember Mom bought it for you

53
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,850
when you were ill.

54
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,170
I think I've never

55
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,330
liked it since I was little.

56
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:17,050
I will pay you back for the surgery.

57
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:20,480
The surgery and treatment cost
180 thousand yuan,

58
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:23,760
and 100 thousand yuan
was paid by the money Mom left.

59
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,680
Before she died,
she gave me a bank card

60
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,010
without 100 thousand yuan.

61
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,080
She said each of us

62
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,130
would take half when we grew up.

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,760
Half for each?

64
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:43,080
On my 10th birthday,

65
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,640
she said it was an important day

66
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,170
that must be celebrated.

67
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,010
She bought both of us gifts

68
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:53,520
with her savings.

69
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,010
She tried so hard
to take me back to visit you,

70
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:00,130
but Grandma stopped her at the door.

71
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:03,480
Then she died of illness,

72
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:07,470
and I was sent back.

73
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:10,130
As for the rest,

74
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,520

She heard you were coming back,

106
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,000
so she immediately decided

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,410
to give her bed to her idol,

108
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:58,770

00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:30,650
Then why do you want to keep skating?

188
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,010
I'm giving you time

189
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:40,170
to figure it out.

190
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,490
Besides,

191
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,010
you're absent-minded.

192
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,920
You'll have a bad influence on the kids.

193
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:46,960
You're their role model now.

194
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,130
I can't believe I'm a role model.

195
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:59,390
You've done well in many aspects.

196
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:20,320
- Han?
- You're here.

197
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,010
Do you have to
dress up like this for me?

198
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,050
Oh my god.

199
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,170
Dress up for you?

200
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,200
Don't flatter yourself.

201
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,170
How did you know I was here?

202
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:31,050
Ms. Han asked me to take you out

203
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:32,150
for a walk.

204
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,500
Where are we going?

205
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,890
A place we both want to go.

206
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,640
Is that your new car, Mr. Huang?

207
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,650
Not a good one. Let's go.

208
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,010
Ms. Han.

209
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,370
Is your leg healed?
Why are you running around?

210
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,770
Much better. Don't worry.

211
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:19,960
Don't just stand there. Have a seat.

212
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,010
Master!

213
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:28,170
You came back a long time ago
but didn't visit us.

214
00:12:28,770 --> 00:12:30,770
Ms. Han didn't allow me to go out.

215
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:33,250
I'll talk to her later.

216
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,490
Well,

217
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,370
why isn't Nie Chi with you?

218
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,410
Okay, I won't ask.

219
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,080
I won't ask.

220
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,290
Let's go inside.

221
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,890
My sweethearts can't wait

222
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,440
to see my favorite student.

223
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,560
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's go.

224
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,960
I want to take her back.

225
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,410
Where? The national team?

226
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:59,080
Lin Ge knows where it is.

227
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,200
She was sent back.

228
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,130
Have you been in touch lately?

229
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:09,490
No.

230
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:13,410
Ms. Han, how's she doing right now?

231
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:17,200
She can finish the training,

232
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,340
but she's absent-minded.

233
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:22,010
I gave her a week off.

234
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,360
She needs time to figure it out.

235
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:28,250
Do you know where she is?

236
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,370
Are you sure it's a good time
to see her?

237
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:47,330
Ms. Han,

238
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:49,320
during my rehabilitation,

239
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,720
I figured out a lot of things.

240
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,600
When I came here,

241
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:55,320
I was always alone,

242
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,250
but Lin Ge helped me make many friends.

243
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,440
I didn't get along with my parents,

244
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,200
but she broke the barrier between us.

245
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,530
How can I leave her alone

246
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,440
in her hardest times?

247
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,010
Your company can't help her overcome

248
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,490
the obstacle she's facing.

249
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,890
I know you love and trust

250
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:16,290
each other.

251
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,440
But she has to figure it out by herself

252
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,290
to get through this.

253
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,840
No one can help her, including you.

254
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,890
Ms. Han, but...

255
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:27,770
Go back to Beijing.

256
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,800
Start training as soon as possible.

257
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,530
Keep your distance. Lower your body.

258
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,960
Keep up with others. Use your legs.

259
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,280
Use your legs.

260
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,650
One, two, one, two.

261
00:14:46,770 --> 00:14:48,140
- Zhu Zhu?
- One,

262
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,290
- I forgot it.
- two.

263
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,080
I'm working for your senior sister now.

264
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,890
What does that mean?

265
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,320
- She's young and smart.
- Attention. Keep up.

266
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,500
- She contacted
- Legs.

267
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,410
- the schools around here
- Legs.

268
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:00,890
- and opened this
- One,

269
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,080
- after-school class.
- two.

270
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,650
- You know what?
- Attention. Turn.

271
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,050
I have many students now.

272
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,610
Mr. Fang.

273
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,720
It's my turn? Okay.

274
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,370
Come on, boys and girls.

275
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,800
A fast horse

276
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:16,290
will eventually meet a faster leopard.

277
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:19,410
There are people
you can never keep up with.

278
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:23,250
There are things
you can never get through.

279
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:37,920
It's been a long time.

280
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,920
A long time? You often come here.

281
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,010
I was always behind the board.

282
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,680
How did you notice me?

283
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:50,770
Still laughing? How are you doing?

284
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,770
Zhu Zhu, why did you...?

285
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,920
My knee injury was serious.

286
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,890
I couldn't go further in the team,

287
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,370
so I told Mr. Li about it

288
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,250
and came here.

289
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:03,200
You won a gold medal.

290
00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:04,370
It's worth it.

291
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,490
Enough.

292
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,130
You don't have to comfort me.

293
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,090
I get it.

294
00:16:08,490 --> 00:16:10,870
I took her out for a walk.

295
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:13,080
Can you give her some advice?

296
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:14,980
Then why are you still here?

297
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,570
I'll fill up the car.

298
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,200
I'm not a good adviser.

299
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,680
Thanks, Zhu Zhu.

300
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:29,600
Actually, I'm fine.

301
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:33,840
Are you going to stay
in the provincial team?

302
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:38,650
If you're not leaving,

303
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,080
maybe you should consider
my interest class.

304
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
We need a coach,

305
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,680
and you'll make more money.

306
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:48,960
Zhu Zhu, when did you figure it out?

307
00:16:49,530 --> 00:16:51,080
Why wouldn't I?

308
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,290
I've tried my best for my career.

309
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:54,410
I have no regrets.

310
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,050
However,

311
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,170
have you tried your best?

312
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,170
Do you have regrets?

313
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:07,210
I...

314
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,770
I don't know.

315
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:14,050
I'll stop talking.

316
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,720
Just one thing,

317
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:17,730
don't make him wait too long.

318
00:17:21,930 --> 00:17:22,880
Zhu Zhu.

319
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:25,210
I owe you an apology.

320
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,250
Now I apologize.

321
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,800
Besides, the invitation will not expire.

322
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:51,260
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

323
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:53,970
Are you sure it's a good time
to see her?

324
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,600
But she has to figure it out by herself

325
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,320
to get through this.

326
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:02,290
No one can help her, including you.

327
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,560
Nie Ge, you're back.

328
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,880
I'm so glad.

329
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:08,160
You have no idea.

330
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,360
Lin Chi was so upset
when she picked up her package.

331
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:13,500
I feel sorry for her.

332
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,400
Talk to her.

333
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,690
People need company.

334
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,010
Thank you.

335
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,860
(Lin Ge)

336
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,640
Fang, the filling is so small.

337
00:18:33,730 --> 00:18:34,570
I don't think so.

338
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,400
No way. It's too small.

339
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:37,450
Will you eat it?

340
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,840
Is that small?

341
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,770
Then I'll use spring pancake skin.

342
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:43,850
Sweetheart.

343
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,890
You're on vacation. Just enjoy it.

344
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:49,250
Clear your mind, okay?

345
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,880
Let's go shopping tomorrow.

346
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,640
I'll buy you some fancy clothes.

347
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,840
We'll use your master's private money.

348
00:18:56,210 --> 00:18:57,050
What?

349
00:18:57,290 --> 00:18:58,400
It's ridiculous.

350
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,010
My private money...

351
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,070
I don't have private money.

352
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:03,970
Don't try to set me up.

353
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:05,360
Okay, master, Mrs. Fang,

354
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,320
I'll buy clothes

355
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
for both of you.

356
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:11,530
I knew it.

357
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,490
Sons are not reliable.

358
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,690
Our daughter

359
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,880
is the real sweetheart.

360
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,800
Exactly.

361
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,620
(Nie Chi)

362
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,360
Lin Ge, I want to see you.

363
00:19:25,970 --> 00:19:27,530
I'll wait in Huang Han's restaurant.

364
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,730
Maybe you should see him.

365
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,360
He came all the way here.

366
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,320
I can't believe it.

367
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,010
Why can't he come home?

368
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:40,880
Right?

370
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,360
What are you doing?

371
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,720
You could've seen her

372
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,930
if you'd called me earlier.

373
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,180
Did you break up?

374
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:08,600
No, no way.

375
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,120
That's great. Listen,

376
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,880
a man needs to be cold.

377
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,800
No, a man needs to be persistent.

378
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:19,370
Mr. Fang.

379
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,250
Master.

380
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:26,010
I'll get some hot food.

381
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:42,250
White wine?

382
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,250
How's your leg?

383
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,970
Want to see Lin Ge?

384
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:06,800
Master, why did Lin Ge refuse to see me?

385
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,640
She's still confused.

386
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,530
It's a big deal.

387
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:11,970
Give her a break.

388
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:16,800
But I'm afraid she'll give up
if she takes a break.

389
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:17,770
Impossible.

390
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:20,080
She's never thought about

391
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,530
giving up.

392
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,640
Give her some time.

393
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:30,080
When she figures it out,

394
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,880
she'll go back and keep skating.

395
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:36,690
It's not like that. I'm afraid

396
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,320
she'll give up on me.

397
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,320
Master... I'm so sad.

398
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,290
What are you doing?

399
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:50,970
That's not an excuse for drinking, okay?

400
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:57,080
Go back to Beijing as soon as possible.

401
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:58,970
I won't go anywhere

402
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:00,920
until I see her.

403
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,730
Are you an idiot?

404
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,160
What about your career?

405
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:06,120
I want to see her now.

406
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:14,930
Kid, I've been there before.

407
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,120
You can't go too far in love.

408
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:21,360
My wife had so many

409
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,880
admirers back then,

410
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,450
but I was the most restrained one.

411
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,250
When she figured it out,

412
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,840
she chose me.

413
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,360
You learned skating skills from me.

414
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,260
Why didn't you learn other strengths?

415
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,400
Give each other some time

416
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,360
to calm down,

417
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,680
understand?

418
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,000
Master.

419
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,120
I'm very calm right now.

420
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:48,160
I've stayed calm all my life.

421
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,930
Please allow me to be bold for once.

422
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,880
Just this time.

423
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,450
Ge, leave it to me.

424
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:08,010
I know you're upset.

425
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,400
You can cry if you want to.

426
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:54,930
I'm back.

427
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:57,040
I told you to see him off.

428
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,380
Why did you drink so much?

429
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,160
It wasn't my idea.

430
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,770
Nie Chi insisted.

431
00:25:03,970 --> 00:25:04,970
You're also a coach.

432
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:06,730
Don't you know athletes can't drink?

433
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,080
I'm not drunk.

434
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,450
I only drank a little.

435
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,680
Where's Nie Chi?

436
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,320
Where's Nie Chi?

437
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:20,400
He said he'd buy a little panda

438
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:23,080
for my sweetheart.

439
00:25:27,490 --> 00:25:29,210
It's expensive. Why did you buy it?

440
00:25:29,210 --> 00:25:30,600
I want to buy something to celebrate it.

441
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:32,320
For our promise.

442
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,640
Then he left.

443
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,890
She...

444
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:03,300
(Blessing)

445
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,640
Lin Ge.

446
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:14,320
I bought it.

447
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:17,360
Where are you?

448
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,250
I'll send it to you, okay?

449
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,690
Don't ignore me.

450
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,290
Lin Ge...

451
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:56,330
Where are you?

452
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,080
Go back to Beijing.

453
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,880
Lin Ge, I want to see you.

454
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,250
I miss you so much.

455
00:27:17,930 --> 00:27:20,840
Lin Ge, I want to see you.

456
00:27:21,530 --> 00:27:23,050
I miss you so much.

457
00:27:43,970 --> 00:27:45,800
You shouldn't have got drunk.

458
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:47,840
Your knee must be hurting.

459
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,640
I miss you.

460
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,120
I miss you too.

461
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,640
Go back to Beijing,

462
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,210
go to competitions,

463
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,290
win gold medals,

464
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,080
and fulfill your dream.

465
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,570
I don't know

466
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,400
how to fulfill my dream without you.

467
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,840
I'll stay with you.

468
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:47,160
I'll always be there.

469
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,360
(If you asked me ten years ago)

470
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,970
(what the athletic identity
means to me,)

471
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,320
(I probably would say something boring)

472
00:29:06,770 --> 00:29:09,530
(like dorm, canteen,
prizes, and salaries.)

473
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,450
(Not until this moment)

474
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,050
(have I realized)

475
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:15,930
(even if I can only feel)

476
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:17,400
(the wind blowing on my face)

477
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,770
(and watch the people around me)

478
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:21,360
(when I'm skating,)

479
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,250
(it'll be worth)

480
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,160
(the wait.)

481
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:06,100
(Nie Chi: If you can't come back,
I'll go find you.)

482
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,450
Oh my god!

483
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:11,840
What? Who's public persona is ruined?

484
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:14,160
It's your boyfriend's love confession!

485
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:15,730
My boyfriend?

486
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,960
Look!

487
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,770
Oh my god. How could he do that?

488
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,730
Didn't we agree
to keep our distance in public?

489
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,640
It's so romantic.

490
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:30,450
It's indeed romantic,

491
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,020
but what about

492
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,400
returning to the national team?

493
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,840
I have to call him now.

494
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:38,900
Wait a minute. Look.

495
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:45,010
(Chao Jinting)
Stop showing off. I have pictures too.

496
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,070
(Xie Lingwei)
I have them

497
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,540
(Fang Chao: You cropped me out?)
too.

498
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,010
Why is everyone involved in this?

499
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,530
Oh, no!

500
00:30:53,690 --> 00:30:55,530
Mr. Li will definitely find out!

501
00:30:55,930 --> 00:30:56,970
Don't worry.

502
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,250
Your team leader Gao Kai
reposted it too.

503
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,530
Will Mr. Li fire him too?

504
00:31:00,770 --> 00:31:01,770
He can't punish everyone.

505
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,690
Do you really think he can't?

506
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,840
Wait. I have to scold him now.

507
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,560
It got into my eyes.

508
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,530
So stupid.

509
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,720
Darling,

510
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,930
Lin Ge is such a good girl.

511
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,360
Why can't she be my daughter-in-law?

512
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,490
- Lower.
- She is.

513
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,560
Isn't Nie Chi your half-son?

514
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,450
- Okay.
- You need to pay for the red packets

515
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,400
and the dowry.

516
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,240
Leave it to me.

517
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,720
Yes.

518
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:38,160
- Yes.
- Let me do it.

519
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:39,770
It's my duty.

520
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:42,560
Stop.

521
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,530
Check my phone.

522
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:57,530
It's Mr. Li.

523
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,210
He's calling?

524
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,680
What should I do?

525
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,160
Take it.

526
00:32:09,210 --> 00:32:10,260
Hello, Coach.

527
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:15,080
Lin Ge, you've been
in a good mood lately, right?

528
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,600
Not bad, coach.

529
00:32:19,930 --> 00:32:21,290
I saw Nie Chi's post.

530
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,690
How long are you going to
stick together?

531
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:25,530
Is there anything you want to say to me?

532
00:32:29,540 --> 00:32:31,930
Coach, I want to return to the team.

533
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,210
Can I go back?

534
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,320
Do you think you can leave and return

535
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,930
whenever you want?

536
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,880
If you can't pass

537
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,450
the national team's test race tomorrow,

538
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,600
you'll be expelled.

539
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,770
Tomorrow. Understand?

540
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,050
Thanks, Coach.

541
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:56,560
Thanks, Coach.

542
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:59,970
The new Olympiad has officially begun.

543
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,770
As the host,

544
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:03,640
we must show the world

545
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,160
what we've got.

546
00:33:05,970 --> 00:33:07,450
Beijing Winter Olympics in four years.

547
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,210
Are you ready?

548
00:33:09,210 --> 00:33:12,530

Zhu Zhu,

556
00:33:27,900 --> 00:33:28,740
I like you.

557
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:30,400
Can you be my girlfriend?
