A world champion?

Get lost too.

29
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:41,000
What's most important for you

30
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,360
is to take care of your leg.

31
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,360
When you achieve results in next season,

32
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:45,920
you can only turn the tide.

33
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,450
If you lack competitive spirit

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,290
and dare not stand out,

35
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,690
then you will be eliminated.

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:51,480
He asked me to take the lead

37
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,250
in 1,500m next time.

38
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,640
Mr. Li said her grandma passed away.

39
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:57,000
Her family kept it from her to allow her

40
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,600
to prepare for the competition.

41
00:01:58,970 --> 00:02:00,890
I want to see my grandma.

42
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:10,180
=Episode 17=
=We Are Teammates And Opponents=

43
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,080
Wei's grandma passed away.

44
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,410
Why not tell her?

45
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:15,920
Because

46
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:18,730
this is her grandma's last words.

47
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:20,290
Understand?

48
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:23,480
So I will give her some time

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,610
to let her take a break.

50
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:26,920
Let me tell you

51
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,480
about the latest decision from the team.

52
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,960
The tour is about to begin in next station.

53
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,240
Xie Lingwei definitely can't participate.

54
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,360
So the team needs you to take it on now.

55
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,290
Mr. Li, do you mean

56
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,240
letting me be the main force?

57
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:45,450
Yes.

58
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,730
I will arrange for someone to assist you

59
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:49,610
and help you achieve better results.

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,920
Do you dare?

61
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,050
I... But Mr. Li, Wei...

62
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,760
This is a process she must go through.

63
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,340
(World Tour Kunming Station)

64
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,480
Winning a silver medal is impressive.

65
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,640
You don't bear to take it off.

66
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,760
Who are you showing off to?

67
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,360
I came here right after I received the medal.

68
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,710
Do you have any conscience?

69
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,410
Don't go too far.

70
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,250
Can you take care

71
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,760
of me who is about to compete?

72
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,170
Chao,

73
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:33,610
why are you so nervous?

74
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,290
How can I not be nervous?

75
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,290
Daniel is really impressive.

76
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,890
I just ran into him

77
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:39,890
in the break room.

78
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,330
He smiled at me with his mouth open.

79
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,330
I wish I could give him two punches.

80
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,920
I've helped you simulate it so many times.

81
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,280
If you can overtake me, you'll win him.

82
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,680
If I can catch up with him, I...

83
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:53,080
I will be grateful.

84
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,290
If not, then you follow him closely.

85
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,850
He gold medal, and you silver medal.

86
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,080
He silver medal, and you bronze medal.

87
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,290
What if he gets a bronze medal?

88
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:01,890
It doesn't matter. Just follow him closely.

89
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:05,640
May God bless me.

90
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,240
May Daniel win a gold medal,

91
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,890
so I can have a silver one.

92
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,480
Can't you be a bit more ambitious?

93
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,960
Isn't it possible to win him once?

94
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,680
Hurry up and make a new wish.

95
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,610
I don't wish.

96
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't believe in this stuff.

97
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,920
You go out.

98
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,680
Don't bother me. I don't believe in that.

99
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,920
You get out of here. Go, go, go.

100
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,610
Follow him closely.

101
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,320
Close the door.

102
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
Dear audience, please take a short break.

103
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,730
Next up is

104
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,000
the men's 1,500m final.

105
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,920
Let's look forward

106
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,880
to the athletes' wonderful performances.

107
00:04:50,770 --> 00:04:51,610
Follow him closely...

108
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,290
Relax.

109
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,610
I have worn it since I was little.

110
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,880
I have passed various important exams.

111
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,290
It's all thanks to it.

112
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,240
What does that mean?

113
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,610
Let me wear it?

114
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,410
No, it's too expensive.

115
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,610
Take it.

116
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,770
The men's 1,500m final

117
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,480
for the World Tour Kunming Station

118
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,050
has come to the final half lap.

119
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,170
Hungary's veteran Daniel

120
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,210
is only half a body length ahead.

121
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,290
Fang Chao is accelerating.

122
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:33,610
He made it!

123
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,920
They are racing side by side,

124
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,170
crossing the finish line at the same time.

125
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,730
- Can Fang Chao do it?
- Which place?

126
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:39,770
Cross the line at the same time?

127
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:40,800
How come I didn't see it clearly?

128
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,680
Me neither. Did you see it clearly?

129
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,690
No.

130
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,410
Of course, it was Fang Chao.

131
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,920
Because of my blessings.

132
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,890
Well done!

133
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,880
You did a good job. Wait for the results.

134
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:20,250
You made it!

135
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,020
Third place.

136
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,990
- The results are out.
- Congrats!

137
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,840
Thank you, Mr. Li.

138
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,000
Fang Chao secured third place

139
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,610
and defeated his old rival,

140
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:29,360
creating his own miracle.

141
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,650
How about it? Is my blessing effective?

142
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,290
It's effective. Thank you.

143
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,850
My pleasure. Go ahead.

144
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,000
Come quickly. Come on.

145
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,650
It works, bro.

146
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,050
It works.

147
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,210
Good for you.

148
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,730
All right. You're exaggerating.

149
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,680
I didn't win a gold medal.

150
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,050
This...

151
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,360

I used to do this work.

165

The final list has come out.

166
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,560
What lane will I be in?

167
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,960
The outermost lane.

168
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:34,970
Yang Xiaofei, the first lane.

169
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:40,010
It's ok.

170
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,120
Anyway, your goal is to compete for medals.

171
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,000
Yang Xiaofei can't influence much.

172
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,820
I know I aim for the top three.

173
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,240
I'm afraid that Yang Xiaofei

174
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,080
will pull me out.

175
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:48,930
It's ok.

176
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,360
You're worrying too much.

177
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,880
Probably, you won't catch up with her.

178
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,940
You...

179
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,680
Listen to me and say less.

180
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,520
Lin Ge.

181
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,840
Mr. Li.

182
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,210
How do you feel now?

183
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,590
Nervous.

184
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,850
Don't be nervous.

185
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,170
Among these people,

186
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,080
except for Yang Xiaofei,

187
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,000
your starting speed is the most advantageous.

188
00:08:06,530 --> 00:08:08,680
If... I say if

189
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,530
you don't get ahead of her at the start,

190
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,170
just skate steadily.

191
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,000
I have absolute confidence in you.

192
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,320
Yes.

193
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,560
You have fully grasped Yang Xiaofei's

194
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,680
characteristics and strategies.

195
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,050
Just relax.

196
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,880
Got it.

197
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,800
Dear audience,

198
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,850
next up is

199
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,800
the exciting women's 500m final.

200
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,850
Ready!

201
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:33,200
The four players and all the audience

202
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,440
are holding their breath.

203
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,410
For all Chinese fans,

204
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,290
the most important opponent for Lin Ge today

205
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,800
is the old rival Yang Xiaofei.

206
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,650
The starting signal sounds.

207
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,320
Relying on her strong explosiveness,

208
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,520
Yang Xiaofei secured the first place.

209
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:50,600
The second place is Li Jiawen from Hungary.

210
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,320
Lin Ge is currently in third place.

211
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,130
Lin Ge will not be content with it.

212
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,920
She is catching up with all her strength.

213
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,320
At the straight track,

214
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,440
Lin Ge relies on her absolute strength

215
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,770
to overtake one player.

216
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,080
A wonderful overtaking.

217
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,250
Bravo!

218
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:06,680
Lin Ge has secured the second place.

219
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,920
Lin Ge!

220
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,440
A hard-won overtaking.

221
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,560
Now the only goal ahead,

222
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,290
the only opponent is Yang Xiaofei.

223
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,370
Yang Xiaofei is still speeding up.

224
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,600
- The speed is extremely fast.
- Come on.

225
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,720
Let's see if Lin Ge has any chance.

226
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,650
They're constantly competing in the last lap.

227
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,800
Look at Lin Ge.

228
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,370
She speeds up at the curve. Lin Ge!

229
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,320
The two have been neck and neck.

230
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,010
Lin Ge has even taken the lead.

231
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:38,250
Be careful, Lin Ge.

232
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:51,250
This match has been exhilarating.

233
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,200
Yang Xiaofei fell down.

234
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:54,490
An unexpected incident happened.

235
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,720
Only Lin Ge is left.

236
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,770
- Hold on.
- All the players have fallen.

237
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,960
Lin Ge, hold on and you'll be the champion.

238
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,770
Lin Ge is the champion.

239
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,760
Amazing!

240
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:10,290
She came from third place to take the lead

241
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:13,050
and forced her rival into disarray,

242
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:15,800
falling off the track with the other players.

243
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,920
I need to quickly edit this and post it.

244
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,490
Great!

245
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,100
(I actually had a day full of good luck.)

246
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,960
(Go, Team China!)

247
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,320
(Xie Lingwei's sudden emotional breakdown)

248
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:32,800
(made me stand at the peak of my dreams.)

249
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,100
(But this feeling)

250
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:36,840
(Go, Team China!
(is like spoiled candy,)

251
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:40,200
(sweet but bitter, hard to swallow.)

252
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,290
(I don't want to compete with geniuses.)

253
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,440
(We are teammates and opponents

254
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:47,440
(on the field,)

255
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,680
(but we are lifelong friends off the field.)

256
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:54,440
I was too nervous just now.

257
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:56,130
I realize now that I am starving.

258
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,410
How could you not be nervous?

259
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,200
Today, no one was as thrilling as you.

260
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,440
Yes, Lin Ge is really lucky today.

261
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:02,330
Indeed.

262
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:04,080
I'll give you two more chicken legs later.

263
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,650
You go down first.

264
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,960
I have something to talk to Lin Ge.

265
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,370
So disgusting.

266
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:13,290
Close the door. Quick.

267
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,330
What's wrong?

268
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,680
I don't like them saying that.

269
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,650
They keep saying you are lucky,

270
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,530
as if you have no strength at all.

271
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:23,440
Not that serious.

272
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,410
Luck is also a part of strength.

273
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,250
Next time I will be able to skate better.

274
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:29,370
All right.

275
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:32,600
Your quick reaction today is worth praise.

276
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:35,270
Even if she attacks me again next time,

277
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,620
I will definitely be able to overtake her.

278
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,490
Let me show you something.

279
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,980
(The mysterious oriental power)

280
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,370
Don't be frozen. Don't.

281
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,370
The mysterious oriental power.

282
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,250
This is the mysterious oriental power.

283
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:56,290
Lin Ge is really a lucky star.

284
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,530
Just say that I have good luck.

285
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,770
Why come up with so many words?

286
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,060
(Gao Kai: Keep it up!)

287
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,960
So it's because of Gao Kai.

288
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,410
You've almost made my phone freeze up.

289
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,770
My homepage.

290
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,730
0.

291
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,730

(Total fans)

297
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,850
Coming.

298
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,280
Mr. Li.

299
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,520
It's trending.

300
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,800
How do you feel now?

301
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,410
Especially nervous.

302
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,600
I'm still a bit scared now.

303
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:33,130
I only had a few thousand followers before

304
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:34,440
and now it's already over 100,000.

305
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,720
Can you still remember what to do tomorrow?

306
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:37,720
A relay.

307
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,840
Good. You're not completely carried away.

308
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,410
I came over to tell you

309
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,600
that what you need to learn now

310
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:47,320
is to not listen, not look, and not think.

311
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:49,130
If you can't do it,

312
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:51,370
turn off the phone and give it to me.

313
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,200
I'll return it after the relay tomorrow.

314
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
You can rest assured, Mr. Li.

315
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,490
Nothing is more important than the match.

316
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,890
I told Gao Kai the same thing.

317
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,920
Popularity and fans

318
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:06,890
are all false.

319
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,680
They come inexplicably.

320
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,050
They will also leave inexplicably someday.

321
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:12,800
For athletes, only achievements

322
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
is the foundation of their existence.

323
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:16,090
Thank you, Mr. Li.

324
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,490
Have a good rest.

325
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,250
Got it.

326
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:26,530
Sorry to trouble you.

327
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,170
Lin Ge, once. Just once.

328
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:35,650
Let me feel your good luck.

329
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:43,210
Thank you.

330
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:46,800
Ge, please touch me twice.

331
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,200
Give me a hug when it's done.

332
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,600
If you don't mind,

333
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,650
I can also give you two big slaps.

334
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,160
That's enough.

335
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,130
Jinting, how many do you want?

336
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,720
I don't need that.

337
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:01,050
I'm sleeping with you tonight.

338
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,600
Jinting, don't mess around.

339
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,050
I promise you, before the match tomorrow,

340
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,250
I will give you a big hug, ok?

341
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:09,050
No, preliminary, semi-final, and final, three.

342
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,050
Deal!

343
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:12,800
Sorry to trouble you.

344
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:18,130
What?

345
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,370
You also want to share my good luck, huh?

346
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,600
I don't believe it.

347
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:23,370
You don't believe it either.

348
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,650
To prove that both of us are capable,

349
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,720
I'll try to keep a distance

350
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,290
until the end of the match tomorrow.

351
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,560
Go back and rest.

352
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:48,960
We still have a relay tomorrow.

353
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,200
I have handed my phone to Mr. Li.

354
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,320
He'll return it to me in the morning.

355
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,260
Don't message me tonight.

356
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,290
Then you go wash up.

357
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,400
Go to bed early.

358
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:02,370
Bye.

359
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:03,640
Bye.

361
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:31,960
This is a report from the scene.

362
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:34,010
In the final day's match,

363
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,440
Team China won the relay gold medal

In the highly anticipated men's 500m match,

Nie Chi won the silver medal,

367
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,250
and refreshed the national record.

368

Many fans said

369
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:47,680
the young player Nie Chi

370
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,960
will become Gao Kai's successor

371
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,080
and has a promising future.

372
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,560
Did I say I want to retire?

373
00:15:56,770 --> 00:15:57,610
So ridiculous!

374
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,560
(National Ice Sports Base)

375
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,770
We're going to go shopping.

376
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,050
(Honorary Champion Wall)
I'm so envious.

377
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,370
Just focus on your training.

378
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,400
Champion Wall.

379
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,840
- Lin Ge, you're back.
- Ms.

380
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,050
(Women's 500m Champion)
Come and see.

381
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:09,890
Are you happy?

382
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,090
Happy.

383
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,250
Let me share your good luck.

384
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,200
Come on.

385
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,960
Keep it up.

386
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,170
All right then, we're leaving now.

387
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,370
All right, go ahead.

388
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,210
Bye.

389
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,600
Keep it up. Bye.

390
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:24,600
You should get paid in such a scene, huh?

391
00:16:25,530 --> 00:16:28,560
A senior sister claiming to be mature,

392
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,600
has been sticking to me lately.

393
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,960
I am the senior sister. I have privileges.

394
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,080
It's different.

395
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:39,800
Wei, I'm back.

396
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,370
You're sleeping.

397
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:46,290
Wei, aren't you going to train this afternoon?

398
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,320
Can you help me ask for leave?

399
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,770
Ok, then I'll help you ask for leave.

400
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,770
Do you need me to bring you back some food?

401
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,890
I gotta go.

402
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:20,770
Grandma, I miss you.

403
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,820
(The mysterious oriental power)

404
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,640
Feng, what are you watching?

405
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,480
Nothing.

406
00:18:04,930 --> 00:18:06,530
They why have you been watching all morning?

407
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,090
Eat it.

408
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,640
Auntie. Auntie.

409
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,080
Why brings you here?

410
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,970
Do you know that Lin Ge has become popular?

411
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,530
How could it be impossible?

412
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,360
In the last match,

413
00:18:18,530 --> 00:18:20,770
it seemed that she wouldn't win first place,

414
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,800
but guess what happened?

415
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:22,790
The first place player fell

416
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,320
and took everyone else down with her.

417
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,210
Only she didn't fell and got first place.

418
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,530
Everyone

419
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:30,640
says she's lucky.

420
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,120
They say she's a lucky...

421
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:33,940
- No, a lucky star.
- What?

422
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,800
- So ridiculous.
- She can bring good luck.

423
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,320
Bring good luck?

424
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,080
Take a look.

425
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,400
I haven't checked my phone for a while.

426
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,530
There are so many messages.

427
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,450
People I haven't contacted for a long time

428
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,880
are now coming to me to make wishes.

429
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:49,320
Who do they think they are?

430
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,600
Let me see who.

431
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,450
So annoying!

432
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,290
Annoying?

433
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,480
Listen.

434
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,730
By the way, my number one baby,

435
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,880
I want to tell you something.

436
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:02,600
I have an old house

437
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,530
that has been scheduled for demolition.

438
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,450
Can you bless me a little?

439
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:10,050
After it's done, I'll surely reward you.

440
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,160
How about it?

441
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,720
My dad?

442
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:14,210
Is that true?

443
00:19:14,210 --> 00:19:16,360
Why hasn't my dad mentioned it to me?

444
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,400
Then you ask him quickly.

445
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,970
Oh no. Where's my phone?

446
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:22,250
Zhou Yao said she wants a smooth engagement.

447
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,490
Huang Han

448
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:25,360
hopes to take over the store.

449
00:19:25,930 --> 00:19:27,560
All right, put your phone down.

450
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,290
Replay to them after the training.

451
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:31,360
I need to reply to Master first.

452
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:33,400
He also said he will reward me.

453
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,720
Demolition.

454
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,290
Demolition. Demolition. Demolition.

455
00:19:36,630 --> 00:19:38,970
This business is getting worse.

456
00:19:39,450 --> 00:19:40,800
If it weren't my own house,

457
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:42,490
it was closed long ago.

458
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,970
You only know to ask me for money

459
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,290
and don't know anything else.

460
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,290
She can make money in Beijing. So can I.

461
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,490
You can't go.

462
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:55,680
Why?

463
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:56,880
You have a thin skin.

464
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,970
Could you show your head?

465
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,370
Let's do this.

466
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:02,800
I'll buy you a ticket and go with you.

467
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,690
What are you going to do?

468
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:05,840
You don't know

469
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,560
she must get a large amount of money

470
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,320
after winning the world championship.

471
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,720
Money, money, money. You only know money.

472
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,730
I'll go to Beijing to make money.

473
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,690
Don't follow me.

474
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:15,070
- You can't go.
- Why?

475
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:16,290
Why?

476
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,490
I don't know where your dad ran off to.

477
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,360
Your mom hasn't take care of you.

478
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,250
I had a hard time

479
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:25,840
raising you.

480
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,160
If you leave,

481
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,290
what will I do?

482
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,320
You have never traveled far.

483
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,560
There are so many bad people outside.

484
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,080
You are my precious.

485
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,690
What if

486
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,120
something happened to you?

487
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,930
You always said that.

488
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:44,430
What could happen to me?

489
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,490
Do you know I've suffered

490
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:47,360
a lot of grievances because of you?

491
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:49,040
They all call me 'granny's boy'.

492
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,560
Who dares to get my grandson wronged?

493
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:52,070
I will go to deal with him.

494
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,250
Stop that!

495
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,770
Don't interfere in my matters.

496
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,360
Feng! Feng! Feng!

497
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,450
Two hours.

498
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,480
Ok.

499
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,400
No. 45 computer.

500
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:43,320
Is Lin Ge your old sister or younger sister?

501
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,370
I don't know her.

502
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,600
Don't pretend. We all know.

503
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,170
I said I don't know her.

504
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:53,930
Come on.

505
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,120
Lin Feng, let me tell you something.

506
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,730
You are really lucky.

507
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,770
You have a good grandma.

508
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:04,050
Your grandma is getting old.

509
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,250
And you have a sister as well. Right?

510
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:12,050
You don't have to worry about food and drink.

511
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,250
How about you pay for me?

512
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,250
Have another computer?

513
00:22:17,450 --> 00:22:19,160
If you are so rich, pay for me.

514
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,050
You sister is so rich.

515
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:22,880
- Pay for me, ok?
- Two more hours.

516
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,880
Are you finished?

517
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,250
It's not a big deal.

518
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,880
Why are you so stingy?

519
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,840
Why is he so stingy?

520
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:40,050
Do you think I'm at fault?

521
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,690
Doesn't he just have a rich sister?

522
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,320
He's just a granny's boy.

523
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,800
Thank you, Feng.

524
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,570
Goodbye, Feng.

525
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,450
You just resumed training not long ago.

526
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,160
It's normal not to be in good shape.

527
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,600
Don't be anxious.

528
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,690
How could I not be anxious?

529
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:06,290
If I don't work hard to recover,

530
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:09,690
the position will be taken by someone else.

531
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,490
Are you referring to Nie Chi?

532
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,770
He has really made great progress.

533
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,010
The new overthrow the old.

534
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,950
- I don't want to be defeated.
- Gao Kai.

535
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:22,590
Let's go have a meal together, Chen.

536
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,720
Let's go.

537
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:31,970
We're just talking about you.

538
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:34,770
You have improved a lot this season. Keep it.

539
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,600
Strive to break the Asian record next time.

540
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,850
I will do my best.

541
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,730
I'm starving. Let's go eat.

542
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,800
Why do I feel like Gao Kai is a bit off?

543
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:54,770
He's abnormal.

544
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,600
- Abnormal.
- Let's go eat first.

545
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:07,160
Why is Gao Kai acting so strange today?

546
00:24:07,490 --> 00:24:09,210
He actually smiled at Nie Chi.

547
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,690
He's been smiling the whole day

548
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:12,560
and also smiled at me.

549
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,810
No, no.

550
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,050
Today, his smile...

551
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:16,560
...is fake.

552
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,760
You know?

553
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:19,510
I can't say for sure either.

554
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,880
It's just not the same as before.

555
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,770
There were daggers in his smiles before.

556
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:24,880
But today...

557
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,600
Anyway, it's very weird.

558
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,440
I can't say it clearly.

559
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,010
- I also think he is strange today.
- Right?

560
00:24:32,010 --> 00:24:34,010
He even praised Nie Chi in the dorm.

561
00:24:34,690 --> 00:24:36,160
If it were in the past,

562
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,840
he definitely wouldn't be so kind to him.

563
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,270
That sounds a bit strange, huh?

564
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:45,770
Jinting.

565
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,430
Come over and squeeze in with us.

566
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:54,810
What's wrong?

567
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:58,360
Jinting, look at Gao Kai.

568
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,490
Don't you feel

569
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,690
that he seems a bit off today?

570
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:05,400
What does it have to do with me?

571
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,640
Hurry up and eat.

572
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,820
(Athletes apartment)

573
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,470
What are we doing so late?

574
00:25:52,970 --> 00:25:54,320
Stop nonsense. Follow me.

575
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:55,470
Otherwise, I'll break your legs.

576
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:19,690
On this dark and windy night,

577
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,690
no matter how smart I am,

578
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,250
I can't expect you to ask me to ride a bike.

579
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,080
You just need more practice.

580
00:26:26,730 --> 00:26:27,970
Wait until I win you,

581
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:29,250
then you won't have time to think wildly.

582
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:31,770
You win me?

583
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:33,550
Continue.

584
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,640
I didn't stop.

585
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,880
I mean, continue your sarcastic remarks.

586
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,030
This is more like you.

587
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:48,530
In your heart,

588
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:50,080
that's my image?

589
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:51,490
What do you think?

590
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,120
You like being sarcastic.

591
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,530
You are keen on face-saving.

592
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,930
You make things difficult for yourself.

593
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,120
Sounds not so good, huh?

594
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,370
You're just not that good.

595
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,820
Why do you even care about me?

596
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:05,530
Can I ignore you?

597
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,060
You scared all these kids.

598
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:11,490
Chen Mingyuan wrote a speech outline

599
00:27:11,490 --> 00:27:12,770
and prepared to have a talk with you.

600
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,690
If I didn't ask you out,

601
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:16,290
I guess you two

602
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,770
are watching the stars and the moon now.

603
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:19,050
From poetry and songs...

604
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,450
What's the rush?

605
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,010
I'm not...

606
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,010
I should ask you that.

607
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,880
I don't have as much talent as he does.

608
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,730
Can I not be anxious?

609
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,800
I'm not a naturally gifted player either.

610
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:53,800
We've been here for so long.

611
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,970
We have seen a lot of talented people.

612
00:27:57,730 --> 00:27:59,970
Only perseverance can lead us to the end.

613
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,880
You are an Olympic champion.

614
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,490
Cheer you up and continue to show off.

615
00:28:07,010 --> 00:28:07,850
Continue.

616
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,720
Continue?

617
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,480
Cut the crap.

618
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,970
I said I would win you.

619
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,050
Biao.

620
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:44,770
Biao.

621
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:47,600
What's going on, Mrs. Lin?

622
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:49,690
Do you know where Feng went?

623
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,530
Why hasn't he come home so late?

624
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,970
He went to Beijing to work.

625
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,920
Don't you know?

626
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,400
When did that happen?

627
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,010
He took the train this afternoon.

628
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,690
He went with Wu Jie.

629
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:01,290
I even saw them off at the train station.

630
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,930
Mrs. Lin, are you ok?

631
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:06,480
It's ok.

632
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:58,260
(National Ice Sports Base)

633
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,730
So right now,

634
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:01,210
- Your package.
- keep an eye on Wei.

635
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,050
Thank you.

636
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,450
- Lin Ge.
- Ms.

637
00:30:03,690 --> 00:30:04,730
This is Xie Lingwei's package.

638
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,050
Could you take it back to her?

639
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,010
It was sent to the figure skating team.

640
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,200
No one has picked it up.

641
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,450
No one has picked it up?

642
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:11,290
All the time.

643
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:13,530
- Then I'll take it back for her.
- Ok.

644
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

645
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:15,370
Bye.

646
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,730
You take it back for her first.

647
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:52,640
Wei,

648
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,490
there is a package.

649
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,730
I've brought it for you.

650
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,290
Wei,

651
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,490
I can't make it this time.

652
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,530
A colorful rope should be replaced every year.

653
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:10,690
I have braided 100 ropes for you.

654
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:14,250
I hope you can stay safe and sound,

655
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,770
and live a long life.

656
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,080
I braided a few extra.

657
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:21,050
You can share some with Lin Ge.

658
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:24,320
She has been taking care of you.

659
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,080
It's too dangerous for you to go skating.

660
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,970
I am not at ease.

661
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:33,320
After I pass away, I have only one wish

662
00:31:33,770 --> 00:31:36,320
(Safe, Happy)
that you must always be happy,

663
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,320
train hard,

664
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,800
and win the championship.

665
00:31:40,450 --> 00:31:42,730
I am happy for you.
