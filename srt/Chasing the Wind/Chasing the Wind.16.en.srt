Why doesn't she like me?

I scalded Wei?

We're both in the relay team.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,970
Why would I scald her?

36
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,610
Will Lin Ge get into trouble?

Okay, Fang.

42
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,730
You even put on foundation.

43
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,240
Fang,

44
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:29,200
why does the name Lin Ge
look so familiar?

45
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:30,760
Let me see.

46
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:31,680
Did you watch the race?

47
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,480
That's my daughter. I trained her.

48
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,890
A post is going viral today.

49
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,200
What is a post?

50
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,610
Well, someone online said

51
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,680
Lin Ge deliberately

52
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:45,170
injured Xie Lingwei

53
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,570
to win the race.

54
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,890
So many negative comments.

55
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,050
I have to go.

56
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,520
Nie Chi, over here.

57
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,760
Focus on the food.

58
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:16,690
Put your phone down.

59
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,570
You also like to play with your phone
while eating.

60
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,800
Can I check WeChat messages?

61
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,900
(Xie Lingwei's Feet Scald)

62
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,330
What's the point of analyzing this?

63
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,730
I just want you to concentrate on

64
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:40,570
the food.

65
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:44,450
Her teammate is jealous of her

66
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,220
and can benefit from it.

67
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,330
Is this referring to me?

68
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:49,610
I scalded Wei?

69
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:51,450
We're both in the relay team.

70
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:53,450
Why would I scald her?

71
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,660
Nonsense.

72
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,640
Hello, master.

73
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,520
Hello, Lin Ge.

74
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,850
What are you doing?

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,200
Mrs. Fang, I'm having lunch.

76
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,480
How have you been?

77
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,010
Have you eaten well

78
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:13,480
and worn warm clothes?

79
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,200
I've been good.

80
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:17,360
What's wrong? You sound weird.

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,850
Let me talk to her.

82
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,700
She's old enough

83
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:21,800
to face these things, okay?

84
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,640
Get to the point.

85
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,210
Lin Ge, my sweetheart.

86
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,290
Listen to me.

87
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,410
As the saying goes,

88
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,320
"A taller tree in the woods
will be blown over by the wind,

89
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:32,440
and an outstanding person
will be ruined by rumors."

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,280
Get to the point!

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,320
In other words,

92
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,560
it's okay to read

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,850
the negative comments online,

94
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:38,850
but don't overthink it.

95
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:40,000
Fame brings you trouble.

96
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:41,440
Now you're a world champion,

97
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,280
- Exactly.
- right?

98
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,530
Master, Mrs. Fang, I got it.

99
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:45,610
I was freaked out.

100
00:04:45,650 --> 00:04:46,880
I was wondering what happened.

101
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:47,810
Don't worry.

102
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:49,010
I read the post.

103
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,950
It's just nonsense.

104
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,880
I won't take it seriously.

105
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,880
I'm a tough girl now.

106
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,880
Don't worry.

107
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,000
I know how hard

108
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,770
I tried to win the gold medal.

109
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:58,890
Nothing else matters.

110
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,680
That's right.

111
00:05:01,210 --> 00:05:03,090
That's what I've taught you.

112
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,900
I see myself in you.

113
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:08,480
Enough. Stop bragging all the time.

114
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,920
Bragging?

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,440
I'm telling the truth.

116
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:14,090
Yes. You were an outstanding man.

117
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,020
Exactly. Okay.

118
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,680
That's all I have to say.

119
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:18,730
Don't overthink it.

120
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,650
Stay true to yourself.

121
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,440
Enjoy the food. Bye.

122
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,280
Bye.

123
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,240
Master, Mrs. Fang, bye.

124
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,160
Lin Ge.

125
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:32,760
Are you really fine?

126
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,580
Why would I be upset?

127
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:35,710
It's just a post.

128
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:38,770
Maybe I learned to be rational

129
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,680
from someone.

130
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,320
I only want the people who I care about
to believe me

131
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,120
and recognize my ability.

132
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:46,730
Nothing else matters.

133
00:05:58,410 --> 00:05:59,730
What are they talking about?

134
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,880
What's wrong with them?

135
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:06,290
Lin Ge.

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,610
I want to apologize.

137
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,680
For what?

138
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,050
I saw the post online.

139
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,320
Sorry, you were

140
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,680
slandered because of me.

141
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:15,850
It's okay.

142
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,920
They're talking nonsense.

143
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,300
I don't care what they think.

144
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,050
However, Wei,

145
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,770
I do need to tell you something.

146
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:24,050
What is it?

147
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,800
Can you be more independent

148
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,970
and take care of yourself?

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,680
You don't like me anymore?

150
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,050
Do you hate me?

151
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,320
You don't want to play with me?

152
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,770
- No.
- Then why did you say that?

153
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,090
I just want you to learn

154
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:41,050
some simple things

155
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,650
such as boiling water.

156
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,050
I don't want you to get hurt.

157
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,730
Besides, I can't stay with you

158
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,610
24 hours a day.

159
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,360
Boiling water? I know how to do that.

160
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,800
I was just so sleepy

161
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,530
that I scalded myself by accident.

162
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:53,650
But I promise,

163
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,530
I won't bother you anymore.

164
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,440
Please don't hate me.

165
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,120
Don't be angry, okay?

166
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,320
I'm not angry, and I don't hate you.

167
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,440
I'm not upset either.

168
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:08,850
However, my energy is limited.

169
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,240
I also want to get up late,
do the laundry, and do my own stuff

170
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,290
on days off.

171
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,530
You often asked me
to go to events with you

172
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:16,970
for an entire day.

173
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,360
I was so tired.

174
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,720
I got it.

175
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,210
As for tomorrow's event,

176
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,090
I'll go with Gao Kai.

177
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,960
I swear,

178
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,480
I won't force you to come anymore.

179
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,400
Okay.

180
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,210
I'm so glad you can

181
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,560
understand me.

182
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,480
Gao Kai and Xie Lingwei

183
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,800
went to the variety show.

184
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,280
There are many celebrities.

185
00:07:56,730 --> 00:07:58,360
Yes, I remember Gao Kai

186
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,730
is a big fan of an actress.

187
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,560
He even expressed his love on Weibo.

188
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,560
But she ignored him.

189
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,850
Bad news. Check the Super Topic

190
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,090
of Kai or Wei.

191
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,280
Super Topic?

192
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,160
Yes.

193
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,300
(Gao Kai)

194
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:18,990
Oh my god.

195
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,450
What?

196
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:25,730
His ankle was injured.

197
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,050
It's really his ankle.

198
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,010
Let me see.

199
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,410
His ligament isn't torn,

200
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,960
but it's seriously injured.

201
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:48,680
He has to rest well.

202
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,090
Besides, look,

203
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,440
there's a hairline fracture.

204
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,490
Can he

205
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,370
fully recover?

206
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,900
I can't guarantee that.

207
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:59,250
It depends on his recovery progress.

208
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,520
Coach.

209
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,720
Was the show fun?

210
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:17,050
Now you're injured.
You know it's serious.

211
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,130
You seemed to have enjoyed it.

212
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,720
Gao Kai, listen,

213
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,320
starting today,

214
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,200
don't you dare

215
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,200
go to these useless events
during this season

216
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,280
again!

217
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,680
A world champion is no exception!

218
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:33,730
You'll be expelled!

219
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,210
Li.

220
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,440
Don't try to defend him.

221
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,130
I will keep my promise.

222
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,890
Sorry, doctor.

223
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,160
It's okay?

224
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,530
Stop standing here.

225
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,680
Follow me.

226
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:54,080
Doctor, look at this.

227
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,320
Coach, that was so real.

228
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,770
It doesn't matter,

229
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:10,370
as long as my message

230
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:11,920
can be delivered.

231
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:14,970
I knew it.

232
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,280
You knew what?

233
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,320
Torn ligament and hairline fracture
are not a big deal,

234
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,680
but you have to rest well,

235
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,560
understand?

236
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,640
Yes.

237
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:27,010
You yelled at me on purpose

238
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,050
because you wanted

239
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:30,560
to stop them from inviting me
to these events, right?

240
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,130
Listen,

241
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:34,410
an athlete needs good results.

242
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,680
Only good results
can lead you to success.

243
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,250
Other things are just illusions.

244
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,680
Got it.

245
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:42,760
Thanks, coach.

246
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:46,330
Remember

247
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,720
to take some pictures of your foot.

248
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,400
Why?

249
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:55,890
World champion,
don't you have a Weibo account?

250
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,010
Do I need to teach you?

251
00:10:58,290 --> 00:10:59,130
So dumb.

252
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:03,680
Cunning old fox.

253
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,130
What happened?

254
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,290
Can he walk?

255
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,530
Why are you shaking your head?

256
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:15,050
Can he walk or not?

257
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,520
Jinting,

258
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,890
I think she means he can still walk.

259
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,440
Oh my god.

260
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:22,680
Can he walk or not?
It's a simple question.

261
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:23,800
Please say something!

262
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,920
Jinting, Jinting.

263
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,130
Take it easy. Don't push her.

264
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:28,650
Yes, Jinting, don't push her.

265
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,800
- She was freaked out.
- Shut up!

266
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:31,720
Kai posted a picture.

267
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,540
(I can finally take a break.
Don't worry.)

268
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,600
His season is ruined.

269
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,370
How can he tell us not to worry?

270
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,490
So pretentious.

271
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:43,170
Jinting, don't worry.

272
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,170
Fortunately, his bones

273
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,950
and ligaments will recover.

274
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,080
Do you know
how important a season is...?

275
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
How's Xie Lingwei?

276
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,890
Wei was freaked out.

277
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:57,680
Why did you leave the hospital?

278
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,050
It's not a big deal.

279
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:00,170
The doctor wrapped it.

280
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,290
Oh, Lin Ge.

281
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,440
Wei seems to be fine,

282
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,130
but you should take her
to the infirmary.

283
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:07,770
Don't worry, Kai.

284
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,790
Wait a minute.

285
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,490
Nie Chi, open the door.

286
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,430
Let's go to the infirmary.

287
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,740
Wei.

288
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,200
Have some water, Wei.

289
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,890
What is he doing?

290
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,050
Is he showing me he can run?

291
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,680
He's opening the door.

292
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,250
It's okay. No need.

293
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:39,600
Can you handle it?

294
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,490
Of course.

295
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,560
So pretentious.

296
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,290
Why do you have so much stuff?

297
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,530
I wasn't sure if I could

298
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,800
join the national team, so I

299
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:01,010
didn't bring much stuff.

300
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,600
Then I got a gold medal in the relay.

301
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,170
I think I can stay for this season.

302
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,920
By the way, how's your knee?

303
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,440
Same as usual.

304
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,250
It's fine when I rest well,

305
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,770
but I can't do intensive training.

306
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,720
Several world tours are coming up.

307
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:21,530
Remember to see the team doctor.

308
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,490
Don't act cool

309
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,370
like Gao Kai.

310
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,890
He's so pretentious.

311
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,370
Got it. I'll rest well.

312
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,440
By the way,

313
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,490
when did you become so close to Gao Kai?

314
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:37,720
Who's close to him?

315
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:39,170
He just kicked me out.

316
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Which means you're close friends.

317
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,920
Otherwise, he'd be

318
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,600
so polite to you.

319
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,530
Don't you think he's a psycho?

320
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,650
You were the first person
who found he was psychotic.

321
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,130
I've put your toothbrush
and towel in place.

322
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,170
I'll take the trash downstairs.

323
00:14:33,890 --> 00:14:35,320
Is there anything else I can do?

324
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:39,130
No. Just go to training.

325
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,560
I'll take a walk later.

326
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:42,850
Then I'm leaving.

327
00:15:09,290 --> 00:15:10,560
Gao Kai, stop.

328
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:13,250
I've been watching you.

329
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,530
What you are you doing here?

330
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,130
Shouldn't you stay in the dorm?

331
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:17,920
Why didn't you use

332
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:18,760
the wheelchair?

333
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:20,610
You want to walk?

334
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,490
Pay attention to the pace.

335
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:24,170
Adjust your breaths. Come on.

336
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,890
Is it funny?

337
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,560
I'm hungry.

338
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,720
Let's go to the canteen.

339
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
On foot?

340
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,770
The other foot will also get injured.

341
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,130
Fang Chao, come here.

342
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,890
Fang Chao, thanks. Take it back.

343
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,400
Go.

344
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,330
Okay.

345
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,440
Sit.

346
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,600
No... No need.

347
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,520
Sit.

348
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,050
I don't need it.

349
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,440
Don't need it?

350
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,290
Now you need it.

351
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,320
Everyone knows

352
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,490
your season is ruined

353
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,840
because of the variety show.

354
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,800
You've become everyone's joke.

355
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:16,920
What's the point of

356
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,050
playing cool?

357
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,530
The critics won't see it.

358
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:22,320
The priority right now

359
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,840
is to heal your leg

360
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:26,050
and do well in the next season

361
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,490
to prove yourself.

362
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:31,440
It's true, isn't it?

363
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,800
Stop being so pretentious.

364
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,090
What are you doing?

365
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,280
Let me go.

366
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:40,890
I can handle it.

367
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,960
Don't flatter yourself.

368
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,200
Fang Chao, come here.

369
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:53,170
Take him away. Psycho.

370
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:01,490
During the training...

371
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,680
Jinting.

372
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:05,360
Do you think Jinting

373
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:06,600
has been acting weird lately?

374
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:08,050
I do.

375
00:17:08,050 --> 00:17:09,250
She's been having a bad temper.

376
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:12,210
No. She's been caring about Gao Kai.

377
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,770
She got injured earlier this year,

378
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,080
but she wasn't that worried.

379
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,290
Maybe she likes Kai.

380
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,010
How do you know?

381
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:21,250
I think the reason
of some strange phenomena

382
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,160
lies in love.

383
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,400
For example?

384
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,250
For example,
people might change for no reason.

385
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,770
Tolerant people might become petty

386
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,050
and jealous.

387
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:33,930
Careless people might become

388
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,200
sensitive.

389
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,800
Rational people might become impulsive.

390
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:39,050
Something like that.

391
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,770
Who's become impulsive and petty?

392
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,690
Me. I'm talking about me.

393
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,120
When did you become sensitive?

394
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,330
Am I not sensitive?

395
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:50,690
Then give me an example.

396
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,560
When I was with Fang Chao,

397
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:55,560
I felt

398
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,930
someone was staring at me

399
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,080
affectionately.

400
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:00,800
Who was it?

401
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
It was me.

402
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,250
Why didn't I know

403
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:06,320
you could be impulsive?

404
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,640
Now you know.

405
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:24,210
(Participants Arrangement)
Nie Chi, you're in 500m and 1000m.

406
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,450
Mr. Li wants you to lead the team.

407
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,450
I know. I'll try my best.

408
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,250
Nie Chi, Fang Chao.

409
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,530
What happened?

410
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:42,770
Mr. Li just told me the tactic.

411
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,010
What is the tactic?

412
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,290
I'll protect Wei first

413
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:48,250
and fight for myself
if the situation allows.

414
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,120
Why are you sighing? It's okay.

415
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,930
Anyway, he can't ask the fastest skater

416
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,060
to cover for me, right?

417
00:18:58,010 --> 00:18:59,770
When did you figure that out?

418
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:02,490
I've accepted the reality.
I know she's better.

419
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,120
But it's just for now.

420
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:05,970
I won't cover for her forever.

421
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,640
That's right.

422
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,290
You've been working hard.

423
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,440
It must've worked.

424
00:19:11,970 --> 00:19:12,810
Lin Ge.

425
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:16,480
Try our best.

426
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,530
(Participants)
(How will he fight for)

427
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,050
(Nie Chi, Fang Chao...)
(his future?)

428
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,250
(It's such a pity to see a star falling.)

429
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,050
(Xie Lingwei, Lin Ge...)
(Retirement might be dignified,)

430
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:45,360
(but isn't it a fulfillment)

431
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,770
(for an athlete)

432
00:19:47,050 --> 00:19:49,600
(to fight until the last minute?)

433
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,050
(I once asked Gao Kai,)

434
00:19:52,490 --> 00:19:54,290
(and he said with a smile,)

435
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,880
("It's amazing to lead the race)

436
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,550
(Nie Chi)
(and enjoy the wind alone,)

437
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,250
(but it's also happy
to watch your teammates)

438
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,730
(crossing the finish line.")

439
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,640
Coach.

440
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:13,050
Where are you going?

441
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:13,930
The treatment room.

442
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,770
It's muscle strain.

443
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:17,320
Not a big deal.

444
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,970
It won't affect the competition.

445
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:22,490
You have to work hard
in the coming days.

446
00:20:23,050 --> 00:20:25,400
We'll host the next station
of the World Tour.

447
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,970
You have to lead the Men's 1500m.

448
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,200
Okay.

449
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,120
Me? What does that mean?

450
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:35,130
What about Yuan?

451
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:37,360
His back is still injured.

452
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
He might not get into the final.

453
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,840
Well, can you

454
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:43,080
ask Nie Chi to participate in
1500m with me?

455
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,640
He's in 500m, 1000m,

456
00:20:45,730 --> 00:20:48,050
Men's relay, and mixed team relay.

457
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,000
He'll be exhausted.

458
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,090
I...

459
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,160
Why can't you

460
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,320
just be tough for once?

461
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,690
Well, I...

462
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:00,490
You're capable of winning a medal.

463
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,050
Why are you always hiding behind others?

464
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,970
Either Chen Mingyuan

465
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
or Nie Chi.

466
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,130
Why?

467
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,450
Maybe it's because of Nie Chi.

468
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:11,400
We grew up together.

469
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,770
He's better than me in everything.

470
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,970
I feel safe when he's around.

471
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,080
- Can you...?
- But you're in different events.

472
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,210
I don't care
whether he's your inner demon

473
00:21:21,210 --> 00:21:22,290
or your safe harbor.

474
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,800
From now on,

475
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,800
you have to be independent.

476
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,770
- But Coach...
- No buts.

477
00:21:28,970 --> 00:21:29,810
Fang Chao, listen.

478
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,160
There'll be newcomers soon.

479
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,160
If you don't dare to win

480
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:35,050
or fight,

481
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:36,930
you'll be kicked out,

482
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,840
and it'll happen very soon.

483
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,530
Think about it.

484
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:49,020
(National Ice Sports Base)

485
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:53,640
Alright.

486
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,450
What are you thinking?

487
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:06,530
Nothing.

488
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,400
I've been stressed lately.

489
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,880
Because of the competition?

490
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:12,120
Mr. Li talked to me.

491
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,360
He asked me to lead 1500m

492
00:22:16,930 --> 00:22:18,530
and be tough.

493
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:20,530
Well, are you worried you can't?

494
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:22,050
Who can't?

495
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:22,970
How can an athlete say

496
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:24,080
he can't?

497
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,080
However, I've never been tough before.

498
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,730
But I think you can.

499
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,670
Why?

500
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:31,880
I know a secret.

501
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:32,850
What secret?

502
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,450
Among all the boys,
you get injured the least.

503
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,560
You're the strongest one.

504
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,700
Of course you can make it.

505
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,210
Are you serious?

506
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:43,250
Of course. Why would I lie?

507
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,240
Hello.

508
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,480
Mr. Li.

509
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:55,010
Okay, I got it.

510
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,160
Bye.

511
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:04,360
Why are you smiling? What's wrong?

512
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,800
Good news.

513
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,930
I'll follow the team and witness

514
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,050
you lead for the first time.

515
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,770
If you don't make it,

516
00:23:11,050 --> 00:23:12,840
I'll laugh at you with them.

517
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:15,880
Oh, no.

518
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,310
Wei,

519
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,400
Kunming Station will be
the global focus.

520
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,840
We have high expectations of you,

521
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:24,800
(Filming)
genius girl.

522
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,050
I'm not a genius.

523
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,400
I'm grateful that many people
like and support me.

524
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:30,730
Many fans

525
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,530
are interested in the colorful rope

526
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:33,370
you wear.

527
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:34,880
They want to have the same rope.

528
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,120
What's

529
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,320
so special about this rope?

530
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,560
Do you mean this one?

531
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:39,730
Yes.

532
00:23:39,970 --> 00:23:42,120
My grandma made it for me,

533
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,450
so you can't find it anywhere.

534
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,520
She said it would protect me

535
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,120
in competitions.

536
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,750
I also gave one to Lin Ge.

537
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,970
- Yes.
- Here.

538
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
Can you give a few ropes to your fans

539
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,360
through lucky draws?

540
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:58,160
I don't think so.

541
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,050
My grandma is old.

542
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,450
I don't want her to be tired.

543
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,730
Lin Ge, when Wei got scalded last time,

544
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:07,080
you led the team to success.

545
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:09,560
As one of the most popular
female skaters,

546
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:12,010
what do you think of
the competitive relationship?

547
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:14,770
We're good friends.

548
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,400
Please don't make assumptions.

549
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,530
That's right.

550
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:20,770
Besides, as long as
it's a competitive sport,

551
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,420
there'll definitely be competitions.

552
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:24,580
However, we're having
a benign competition,

553
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:26,360
and we share the same goal.

554
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,730
We'll bring glory to our country.

555
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,130
Right, Wei?

556
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,090
Yes.

557
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:32,840
In terms of competitive ability,

558
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,770
who do you think is better?

559
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,610
Of course Wei.

560
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:43,450
I heard about the interview.

561
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,960
Are you upset?

562
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,120
I'm not upset,

563
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,550
but I've realized something.

564
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,920
What?

565
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:54,170
Wei's luck

566
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,020
(Blessing)
isn't from the colorful rope.

567
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,370
Well,

568
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,630
her parents have supported her
since she was young

569
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:03,220
so that she can focus on skating.

570
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,250
From the sports school
to the national team,

571
00:25:06,770 --> 00:25:09,080
her friend Xiao Shanshan
took care of her all the time.

572
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,050
And Mr. Li saw her potential

573
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,970
and offered her many opportunities.

574
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,360
Her debut was a huge success.

575
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,120
You envy Xie Lingwei, don't you?

576
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:21,770
It's not like that.

577
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,080
There's a huge gap between us.

578
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,010
I started skating
when I was 12 years old.

579
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,840
Back then, I only wanted to
find a job and make money.

580
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,690
I was distracted by many things.

581
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,120
That's why I fell behind.

582
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:40,860
However, I'm going to tell you a secret.

583
00:25:42,450 --> 00:25:43,290
What?

584
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,800
I have ambitions now.

585
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,560
Even if I'm not as good as her

586
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:50,010
and can't keep up with her
in a short time,

587
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:53,010
I will surpass her

588
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,530
in Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.

589
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:56,120
Don't slack off,

590
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,010
or you won't be able to keep up with me.

591
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,400
You can't get rid of me.

592
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,160
Hello, Jinting. What's wrong?

593
00:26:09,250 --> 00:26:10,450
I'm coming right now.

594
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,240
What's wrong?

595
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,560
Jinting said Wei went crazy.

596
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,640
I have to check on her.

597
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,050
Jinting.

598
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,400
Lin Ge, hurry.

599
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:47,120
Open the door.

600
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:52,500
(Room 306)

601
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,730
- Wei.
- Wei.

602
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,570
Wei, what happened?

603
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,690
Say something.

604
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,880
Wei, look at me. Don't scare me.

605
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,080
What happened?

606
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,560
Lin Ge!

607
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:24,160
Don't cry, Wei.

608
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:25,770
What's wrong?

609
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,930
Why is she crying?

610
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,120
Wei, what happened?

611
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,930
Wei, don't cry.

612
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,250
It's okay.

613
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:50,480
Wei.

614
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,250
When I was going out,

615
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,970
I heard Xie Lingwei howl.

616
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,730
Scream.

617
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:02,010
Yes, scream.

618
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:03,530
She went crazy,

619
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,490
and no one answered the door.

620
00:28:05,690 --> 00:28:07,050
I thought she was in danger.

621
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,320
Did she tell Lin Ge what happened?

622
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:10,690
No way.

623
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:12,080
She was crying too hard.

624
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:18,210
Did something happen to her family?

625
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,980
(Her grandma passed away.)

626
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:26,340
(Her family didn't tell her.)

627
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:30,840
You're right.

628
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:33,640
Mr. Li said her grandma passed away.

629
00:28:34,770 --> 00:28:36,690
Her family didn't want to distract her,

630
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,130
so she didn't know.

631
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,840
It's just a tour, not the Olympics.

632
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,050
Seriously?

633
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,160
She loves her grandma so much.

634
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,930
She's too young

635
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,200
to handle this.

636
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,400
Did Mr. Li know this a long time ago?

637
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:53,920
Don't talk nonsense.

638
00:28:55,730 --> 00:28:57,690
You need to take care of her

639
00:28:57,690 --> 00:28:58,730
tonight.

640
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,970
Her family will come tomorrow.

641
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,160
Don't worry.

642
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,800
I'll sleep in their room

643
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:04,960
and take care of her.

644
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:08,600
Okay. Rest early.

645
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,210
- Good night.
- Good night.

646
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,840
Jinting, did you stay up all night?

647
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:37,010
Let's check on her.

648
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:47,050
Is she okay now?

649
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:53,680
How is she?

650
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,250
I think she's having a fever.

651
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:01,250
Wei, you're ill.

652
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:02,360
You need to see a doctor.

653
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:03,640
Don't be scared of needles.

654
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:04,640
We'll be there.

655
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,610
Yes.

656
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,600
I don't want to see a doctor.

657
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,800
I want to see my grandma.

658
00:30:18,290 --> 00:30:20,120
She's not going to

659
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,730
actually see

660
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:23,290
her grandma, is she?

661
00:30:23,290 --> 00:30:24,290
No. No way.

662
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,360
Wei, come on.

663
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:28,880
Let's go to the hospital.

664
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,490
Lin Ge.

665
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:38,970
I want to see my grandma.

666
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,730
You can't.

667
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:42,290
She doesn't want to see you now.

668
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,120
She wants you to be happy

669
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,730
and visit her when you're old,

670
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:46,570
okay?

671
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:51,010
How do you know?

672
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:52,770
I...

673
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:59,010
My mom told me that

674
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,880
before she passed away.

675
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:10,560
Hey, get some sleep.

676
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,530
The IV takes time to finish.

677
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,010
- Okay.
- Come on. Lie down.

678
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:20,850
Lin Ge.

679
00:31:23,210 --> 00:31:24,880
Please don't go.

680
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,560
Don't worry. I'm not going anywhere.

681
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:28,690
I'll stay with you.

682
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,130
Okay.

683
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,330
Come on.

684
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,610
Get some sleep.

685
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,210
Lower your right shoulder.

686
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:03,600
Coach, can I ask you a question?

687
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,770
The pace!

688
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:08,560
Why didn't you tell Wei

689
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:09,840
