Why do you choose the Jiangnan Team?

27
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,730
I rely on competitions to make a living.

28
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,480
Ling Ge wants to challenge Zhu Zhu.

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:43,120
If your time is less than 48s,

30
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,400
I will consider you.

31
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,330
A strong opponent

32
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,970
can stimulate her potential better.

33
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:51,840
Do you like skating?

34
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,680
Can I stay in the provincial team?

35
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,890
Have you made up your mind?

36
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,450
No test. Practice the foundation first.

37
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,640
Practice until I say it's ok.

38
00:01:59,690 --> 00:02:01,170
The coach is paying attention to you.

39
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:02,640
She occasionally looked at you,

40
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,000
writing and sketching in her notebook.

41
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:13,740
=Episode 3=
=Why Is Your Face Red?=

42
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,850
I just want to ask you

43
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,730
what's going on with that Lin Ge.

44
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,800
She's a good seedling.

45
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,610
But you just want to force it to grow.

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,960
Unstable foundation leads to a landslide.

47
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,080
Don't you understand?

48
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,480
But she has a good talent.

49
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,010
It's true.

50
00:02:29,210 --> 00:02:31,080
But her foundation is a complete mess.

51
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,960
She does skate quite fast.

52
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,480
She has her own difficulties.

53
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,960
Her situation is quite special.

54
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,920
She wasn't aiming for any great ambition.

55
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,410
I'll talk to you about this another day.

56
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,960
She has been spoiled by me

57
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,360
and become more strong-minded.

58
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,290
It's not easy to teach.

59
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,200
I'm handing her over to you.

60
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,570
Please help me teach her properly.

61
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,360
I'm just about to ask you that.

62
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:57,280
Do you think she can withstand it?

63
00:02:59,060 --> 00:02:59,960
Buddies,

64
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:02,240
lend me a hand.

65
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,410
Yeah, help me too.

66
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,330
Nie Chi,

67
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,290
why do I feel like you're not tired at all?

68
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,360
Who knows?

69
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:09,240
You are tired

70
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:11,520
because the training intensity is high

71
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,610
and you have to adjust the squatting angle.

72
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,050
I caused all this.

73
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,410
But Chao practiced the same as you.

74
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,610
He is also tired.

75
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,800
Chao.

76
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,450
The last few exercises the coach

77
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,450
arranged for you today

78
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,640
were to observe your endurance.

79
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,200
What does it mean?

80
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:30,890
It means she thinks your endurance is good.

81
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,480
She wants you to skate long distances.

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,520
1,500.

83
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,640
What is she observing me for?

84
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,080
Don't you want to stay?

85
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,330
I do.

86
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:42,200
But wanting to stay and being able to stay

87
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,330
are two different things.

88
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,570
Are you silly?

89
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,450
You have to think first before you can do it.

90
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,480
But I can't skate as fast as Nie Chi.

91
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,640
Can I stay?

92
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,330
No need to compare with me.

93
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:55,850
You have items that suit you.

94
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,760
1,500?

95
00:03:57,130 --> 00:03:57,970
Can I do it?

96
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,850
Come on, buddies,

97
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,450
can we not talk about this first?

98
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,920
Can we talk until we get back to the dorm?

99
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,320
All right.

100
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,120
So tired.

101
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:13,870
Hello.

102
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,360
What are you two doing?

103
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,240
I am really too tired.

104
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,730
I really can't climb to the upper bunk.

105
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,000
Can I lie down on your bed for a while?

106
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,560
No need to explain, I understand.

107
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:25,870
I'm going out to call my boyfriend.

108
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:27,930
What? You have a boyfriend?

109
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,050
Are you ok?

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,840
I'm fine.

111
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:55,300
Why is your face red?

112
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:00,880
I am tired.

113
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,480
Aren't you going back to the room yet?

114
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,490
Anything else?

115
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,920
Now is a special period to develop strength.

116
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,000
The difference between us and old members

117
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,090
is muscle strength.

118
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,240
This is a topic for every new member.

119
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:25,770
You don't need to worry.

120
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:27,170
Give us some time to train

121
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:28,190
and we will be able to catch up.

122
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,090
But my squatting angle

123
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,970
can't be changed in a short time.

124
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,530
I lived off the prize money before,

125
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:36,680
so I would slide as fast as I could.

126
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,540
Sometimes, less standard movements

127
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,860
can actually allow for faster sliding.

128
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,240
Master is also soft-hearted.

129
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:43,730
Since I didn't listen to him,

130
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:45,360
he had no way to deal with me.

131
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,000
Have you never thought about what to do

132
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,680
after entering the provincial team?

133
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,890
No.

134
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,530
What I thought is I will be out of money

135
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:56,180
and I have to win next time.

136
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,460
I never thought about the provincial team,

137
00:05:58,850 --> 00:06:00,530
let alone the best provincial team.

138
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,250
Moreover,

139
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,770
shouldn't I blame you for where I am today?

140
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,650
If it weren't for your deception,

141
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,050
I wouldn't have

142
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,680
to pay off the debts from my laziness.

143
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,530
Blame me?

144
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,280
Not at all.

145
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,290
I have a new goal now.

146
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:22,570
Thank you.

147
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:32,320
(Nie Chi likes to talk about the future.)

148
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,530
(He is like a delayed gratification monster.)

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,440
(For the distant future,)

150
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,170
(he can endure anything.)

151
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,320
(He has countless choices in the future.)

152
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,530
(But if I lose the present,)

153
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:46,360
(I will lose everything.)

154
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,970
(But when I rashly stepped into the team)

155
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,000
(and fell flat on my face,)

156
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,680
(I was so fortunate to have someone)

157
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:55,610
(by my side who believes I have a future.)

158
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,880
All right, stop looking.

159
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,050
Come back to life!

160
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,680
Aren't you envious?

161
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,610
Type I meals.

162
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:06,320
What's wrong? You're craving, huh?

163
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:07,920
Every time you see something delicious,

164
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:08,920
you will be like this.

165
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
The adrenaline just starts to kick in.

166
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:13,290
Didn't we eat well in our sports school?

167
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,610
Can our school be compared with the team?

168
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,120
That's completely different.

169
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,850
Moreover, I don't know

170
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,880
when I can stop practicing foundation.

171
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:23,610
You still have time to make up for it.

172
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:25,440
We will definitely be in the top eight.

173
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,800
How do you know we can make it?

174
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,530
Of course we can.

175
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:30,880
Our province is so strong.

176
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,120
As long as you're not at the bottom,

177
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,240
you always have opportunity.

178
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,560
I am the one at the bottom.

179
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,850
Ge, want type I meals?

180
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,700
I am here. Wait for me.

181
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,420
No matter it's type I or II meals,

182
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:02,730
there's no difference in nutrient content.

183
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,920
Ms. Ding won't let you off this afternoon.

184
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,320
Eat quickly.

185
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,880
Try this chicken leg.

186
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,850
The chicken leg is really good today.

187
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:17,290
This is a buffet.

188
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:18,880
If I want it, I can pick it up myself.

189
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,410
Why are you being so polite with me?

190
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,870
Fang Chao,

191
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,880
you want to eat type I meals, huh?

192
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,730
Liu Yang, I want some chicken legs.

193
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:32,690
Can you help me?

194
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,250
I can't help you.

195
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:35,200
You should ask Han.

196
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,530
You are too polite.

197
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,680
Han,

198
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,600
can I ask for a favor?

199
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:51,830
I know,

200
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,600
besides Zhu Zhu,

201
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,170
what you say is the most effective

202
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:57,490
in this area.

203
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:00,380
What's the matter?

204
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,800
I want some chicken legs.

205
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,600
Do you know who can eat type I meals?

206
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,890
You must be in the national top eight.

207
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,530
That's not something casual.

208
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,250
You need to improve your grade first.

209
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,800
This chicken leg...

210
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,130
Come on.

211
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:18,530
I'll give you another one.

212
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:20,560
It's not a big deal.

213
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,090
Thank you, Zhu Zhu.

214
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,380
Thank you, Han.

215
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,090
That yogurt...

216
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,960
I will ask someone else.

217
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,410
He isn't sensible.

218
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:36,440
The vegetables look nice.

219
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,760
Look?

220
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,250
Let me tell you,

221
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,920
when I get to that restaurant,

222
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,010
they are all fascinated by me,

223
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:57,370
saying I am a new star in ice skating,

224
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:58,600
a prince in the ice rink,

225
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,490
and an evergreen tree of the Winter Olympics.

226
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,130
They can't control them anymore.

227
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,320
How crazy they are!

228
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,800
They are eager to put food in my bowl.

229
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,410
I can't take the plate anymore.

230
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,370
Type I meals is not much different from ours.

231
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,960
It's just an extra chicken leg and yogurt.

232
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:12,530
If you want to eat,

233
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,960
I will ask for it every day.

234
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,520
Here.

235
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,170
Zhu Zhu gave this chicken leg to you.

236
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,330
Eat.

237
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:27,520
Happy, huh?

238
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:32,250
Actually, I want to know more

239
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,560
about how Zhu Zhu trains

240
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,800
and dine with her based on ability.

241
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,130
I want to discuss something with you.

242
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,080
You are in the national top eight.

243
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,560
There's absolutely no suspense at all.

244
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,650
Could you not take part in the relay?

245
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:53,260
Just let me have it, please.

246
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,940
I haven't eaten type I meals for two years.

247
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,010
Just tell the coach

248
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,320
you don't want to participate in the relay.

249
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:01,360
You'll definitely have the individual event.

250
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,770
But I can't guarantee

251
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,080
it is you who can replace me in the relay.

252
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,490
Rest assured, I have a way.

253
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,000
What does it mean?

254
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,890
Is it ok or not?

255
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:15,210
Zhou Yao,

256
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,080
don't you have individual events?

257
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,920
Why rely on a relay to reach the top eight?

258
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,290
You don't understand. Sit down.

259
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,130
Let's have a good talk.

260
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,160
Sit.

261
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,490
In the relay, strong teammates

262
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,540
can secure a spot in the finals.

263
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,080
My explosive power isn't good.

264
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,920
The best achievement in a single event

265
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,490
is the top four for 1,000m.

266
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,720
If my state is not good,

267
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,170
I may fall to the top eight.

268
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,960
I heard the coach praise your endurance.

269
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:46,030
Why not improve your explosive power?

270
00:11:46,650 --> 00:11:48,170
I won't bother with that.

271
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,760
Anyway, if I get into the top eight,

272
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,130
I can eat type I meals.

273
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,610
Once I reach this level,

274
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,800
it will be completely different.

275
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,370
There is no much difference.

276
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:58,170
Don't you want to achieve a good ranking

277
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:59,250
and join the national team?

278
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,960
Are you kidding me?

279
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,010
Zhu Zhu didn't even make it.

280
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,560
My position

281
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:09,490
is to provide cover

282
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,710
or to be a back-up

283
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:13,380
in provincial or national competitions.

284
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:14,490
I'm just a rabbit.

285
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,440
Do you understand?

286
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,920
Rabbit? Position?

287
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,680
Who determined it?

288
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,800
So what is my role, Zhou Yao?

289
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,890
We don't need anyone to determine it.

290
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,600
At what level you are,

291
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,770
what position the coach assigns you,

292
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,890
it becomes an unspoken understanding slowly.

293
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,410
Take me for example.

294
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,170
I'm satisfied to be able to get into the team

295
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,200
and be an official staff.

296
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,920
Just be content and happy.

297
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,620
Join a provincial team,

298
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,320
get a ranking for the province,

299
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,850
and have a university to go to.

300
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,960
This is how I think about it.

301
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,650
I used to think this way as well.

302
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,010
What about now?

303
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,680
Now...

304
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,370
(Now I'm no longer satisfied with this.)

305
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,560
(I must become an athlete like Zhu Zhu.)

306
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,980
(National Grand Prix)

307
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:43,930
Zhu Zhu,

308
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:46,010
may I ask what preparations you have made?

309
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,410
(Zhu Zhu)
On a normal basis,

310
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,200
I put in the necessary effort.

311
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,840
The coach

312
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:53,370
has set up a systematic training plan for us.

313
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,170
I thank her very much.

314
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,050
My idol resembles a big star.

315
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,200
Congratulations, Zhu Zhu.

316
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,670
You're the national champion. Awesome!

317
00:14:06,990 --> 00:14:07,830
Thank you.

318
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:09,650
Zhu Zhu,

319
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,130
how did you allocate your stamina?

320
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,250
Why do I feel like you went faster

321
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,560
in the last lap than in the first lap?

322
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,050
And your turning speed...

323
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:16,200
Just listen to the coach.

324
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,960
Both of us are champions.

325
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,900
Please take a picture of us.

326
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:23,390
Come on.

327
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,030
Three, two, one.

328
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:30,410
Let me see.

329
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,530
Han,

330
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,840
how do you think?

331
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,290
It's been five years.

332
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,130
I will finally make it this time.

333
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,070
Han, how will we do tonight?

334
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:50,010
You've rehearsed many time. Still ask?

335
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,890
Can you do it or not?

336
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,410
I'm a bit nervous.

337
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,290
What are you nervous about?

338
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,560
Yeah, why are you nervous?

339
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,650
Yeah, why am I nervous?

340
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,410
I feel something is going to happen.

341
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,060
Zhu Zhu.

342
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,540
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

343
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:23,410
I've been waiting for today for five years.

344
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:24,490
What do you want to do?

345
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:27,920
I won the national championship today.

346
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:28,850
Congratulations.

347
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,530
But what does that have to do with me?

348
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,650
You entered the team in the same year as me.

349
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,290
Don't you know my situation?

350
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,320
When everyone else is resting,

351
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,170
you're still practicing.

352
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,010
Your mind is solely on training.

353
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:44,620
I know, I know everything.

354
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,600
To be honest, I've always felt

355
00:15:47,290 --> 00:15:49,490
that I am not worthy of you.

356
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,410
But I proved my abilities today.

357
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,370
I also know that you usually don't like

358
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,770
those superficial things.

359
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,960
This is a limited edition pair of sneakers.

360
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,250
I give this to you.

361
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:05,560
Then I hope I can walk...

362
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,840
How should I say?

363
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,720
I like you.

364
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,920
He's confessing.

365
00:16:11,510 --> 00:16:19,490
Be together!

366
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:20,800
I like you.

367
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,370
I want to be with you.

368
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,290
Can you be my girlfriend?

369
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,290
It seems that Zhu Zhu is not very willing.

370
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,440
Is she?

371
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,170
How come I don't notice this?

372
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:36,170
I even feel a bit moved.

373
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,800
Zhu Zhu doesn't want to be in a relationship.

374
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:39,890
But she doesn't say

375
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:41,530
she doesn't like Huang Han.

376
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,080
She doesn't want to date right now.

377
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,530
It doesn't mean she won't want it later.

378
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:45,560
If she wants to date later on,

379
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,530
she can still choose Huang Han.

380
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,440
Come on.

381
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,890
She doesn't like him.

382
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:50,960
You're stupid.

383
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,320
Huang Han, get up first.

384
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:54,410
If you don't agree, I won't get up.

385
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,600
These shoes are quite expensive.

386
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,290
Your family conditions are not good.

387
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:00,560
Can you return them?

388
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,590
That's impossible.

389
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:05,400
If I give something to someone,

390
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,690
it cannot be refused,

391
00:17:07,690 --> 00:17:08,600
nor can it be taken back.

392
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,880
Why do I feel like they are forcing her?

393
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,640
The coach doesn't know about it yet.

394
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,490
Take your brothers away right now.

395
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:18,160
I'll pretend this didn't happen today.

396
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:22,690
Zhu Zhu! Zhu Zhu!

397
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,880
Zhu Zhu.

398
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:33,400
I was wondering why you didn't agree.

399
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,900
Turns out you were afraid of the coach.

400
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,050
Huang Han,

401
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:40,400
I don't like you.

402
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,730
I won't accept your gift.

403
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,120
I won't agree to you either.

404
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:44,730
Can you understand?

405
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,880
Oh no, Zhu Zhu is in trouble.

406
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:51,600
Zhu Zhu.

407
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,080
What are you doing?

408
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,770
Sorry, Huang Han.

409
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,450
I have something to talk to Zhu Zhu.

410
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,600
What's it?

411
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,160
Can't see what we are doing?

412
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,250
Can't you see it?

413
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,570
Get lost.

414
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:05,770
I saw it and heard it too.

415
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,970
Zhu Zhu said she doesn't like you.

416
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:10,570
You...

417
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,640
Don't you have any insight?

418
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:14,470
- Want to fight?
- Stop!

419
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:15,450
It has nothing to do with you.

420
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,290
Is that enough?

421
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,140
Come on.

422
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:20,600
You want the coach to know it, right?

423
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,360
Zhu Zhu, he...

424
00:18:24,450 --> 00:18:26,400
Let's go, let's go.

425
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,210
I should beat that guy.

426
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:31,790
Brat!

427
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:33,690
- You go back first.
- This is not over.

428
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:35,250
We'll find a chance to deal with him.

429
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,090
Go!

430
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,400
Stop talking.

431
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:42,220
Let's go.

432
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,190
I don't like you.

433
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:04,640
I won't accept your gift.

434
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,010
I won't agree to you either.

435
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,530
Can you understand?

436
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,770
Zhu Zhu said she doesn't like you.

437
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,640
Nie Chi.

438
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,690
I want to talk to you alone.

439
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:27,840
You go back first.

440
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,090
Let's go.

441
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:37,450
Why did you help me?

442
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,290
Huang Han is the captain, you know?

443
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,200
I don't know.

444
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:44,320
You helped me today.

445
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,320
He might look for trouble with you.

446
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:47,920
It's ok.

447
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,160
All three of us couldn't stand it anymore.

448
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,840
It's just that I ran the fastest.

449
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,200
Thank you.

450
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,320
If he gets you into trouble in the future,

451
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:57,360
I will help you.

452
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,490
No need to be so polite.

453
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,970
Lin Ge always brings you up.

454
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,490
She regards you as an idol.

455
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,930
You are her goal.

456
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,400
Really?

457
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,880
I see you three are always together.

458
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,010
Are you good friends?

459
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,360
We came from the same school.

460
00:20:12,450 --> 00:20:13,690
We've known each other for a long time.

461
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:17,050
Well, since you help me today,

462
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,760
I will treat her better in the future.

463
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,400
Zhou Yao, let me tell you,

464
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,840
big news.

465
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,130
Sit.

466
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,940
I heard that Huang Han confessed to you.

467
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,400
Who did you hear that from?

468
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:41,050
It was spread among the boys.

469
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:42,290
You refused him.

470
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,160
I don't like him.

471
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,730
Tell me in detail

472
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:46,840
what exactly happened.

473
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,720
What gift did he give you?

474
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,770
I heard it was quite grand.

475
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:50,010
Balloons and candles.

476
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,690
Why don't you agree to him?

477
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,080
If I tell you,

478
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,210
everyone in the team will know it

479
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,530
tomorrow.

480
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:00,210
What did you think?

481
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,160
You've offended Han.

482
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:04,930
Anyway, Han is a big shot

483
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:06,160
in the team.

484
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:08,290
In other words,

485
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,450
you two offended him

486
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,210
and dragged me into this.

487
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,050
You are gabbling on and on,

488
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:15,250
like an old lady.

489
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,210
Is your mouth rented?

490
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:18,250
You have to return it?

491
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,010
If you're scared, just leave quickly.

492
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,490
We didn't plan to keep you anyway.

493
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:22,400
We are not familiar with you.

494
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:24,930
Not familiar with me,

495
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,930
but familiar with Lin Ge.

496
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,250
Only you treat her as a treasure.

497
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,360
Let me tell you,

498
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:35,930
if you can't speak properly, then shut up.

499
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,560
Or I will go down and beat you.

500
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:43,250
What are you going to do?

501
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,250
It's so late at night.

502
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,530
Don't be so anxious.

503
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:47,810
Sleep.

504
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,080
What did you think

505
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,160
about rushing up to help Zhu Zhu?

506
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,450
I haven't thought about anything.

507
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,880
Among the three of us, I ran the fastest.

508
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,930
Aren't you afraid of offending Huang Han?

509
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,770
He just looks rough.

510
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,210
He won't do anything to me.

511
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:38,080
Although Huang Han looks rough,

512
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,880
the scene he set up is quite nice.

513
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,730
Why are you laughing?

514
00:22:47,450 --> 00:22:48,400
Did I laugh?

515
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:50,770
You're laughing hard

516
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,320
like a pig.

517
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:55,880
Sleep.

518
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:06,570
Huang Han,

519
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,450
what do you mean by gathering so many people?

520
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:10,730
It's nothing.

521
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,930
You have been here for so long.

522
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,800
Training has been so hard usually.

523
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,970
This is a rare opportunity.

524
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,690
Take you out to relax a bit.

525
00:23:58,770 --> 00:23:59,610
I can't stand it anymore.

526
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,080
No way, it's too hot.

527
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:04,290
I can't stand it anymore.

528
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,360
It doesn't make much sense.

529
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,120
How about we have more fun?

530
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,560
Hold on if you can.

531
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,160
Han.

532
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,770
Han, what's wrong with you, Han?

533
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:57,530
Han.

534
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,880
Han.

535
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,800
Are you ok, Han?

536
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:01,290
Be careful, be careful.

537
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,250
Quick, get out, get out.

538
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,080
What's going on here?

539
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,250
You guys, help us quickly!

540
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,560
Han, Han.

541
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:12,450
Han can't take it anymore, hurry up!

542
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:13,770
Hurry up, don't just stand there!

543
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,010
He won't die.

544
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,640
Stay away from him.

545
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,250
Give him some fresh air.

546
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:31,130
You failed.

547
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,700
Remember to climb on the playground.

548
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:35,560
You little brat!

549
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:36,420
I want water.

550
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:37,490
This guy...

551
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,340
Are you ok?

552
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,080
Water.

553
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,770
Take it easy.

554
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,250
Is that true?

555
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,560
You alone won six people.

556
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,840
Did you live in a sauna room in Beijing?

557
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,880
A small strategy.

558
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,880
What strategy?

559
00:25:53,310 --> 00:25:55,530
People easily become dehydrated in a sauna.

560
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,660
I drank cool boiled water before I went in.

561
00:25:57,950 --> 00:25:59,940
Many of them liked to gather together.

562
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,120
Huang Han sat on the top.

563
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,580
All the hot air rose up.

564
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,120
Finally, everyone couldn't take it anymore.

565
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,460
He insisted on pouring water

566
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,360
and sent himself away.

567
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,490
You are quite cunning.

568
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,400
This matter is finally over.

569
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,320
You are thinking too simply.

570
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,320
This feud is completely set now.

571
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,840
I know you are so anxious

572
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,450
because the coach

573
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,640
doesn't let you train normally.

574
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,770
But you can't train yourself so hard.

575
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,560
Zhu Zhu is so skilled,

576
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,160
but she still increases practices every day.

577
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,190
I don't have the chance to get on the ice.

578
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:49,580
Why can't I work hard to improve?

579
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:50,930
How many years has she trained?

580
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,160
How many years have we trained?

581
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,530
She is now a mature athlete.

582
00:26:54,930 --> 00:26:57,120
She can assess her own physical condition.

583
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,160
Her muscle development is basically complete.

584
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,450
How do you compare?

585
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
You are right.

586
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,940
My physical development is not yet complete.

587
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,800
I'm not smart either.

588
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,360
I still can't assess my physical condition.

589
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,540
I'm completely useless, right?

590
00:27:11,450 --> 00:27:12,420
What are you doing?

591
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:14,120
What are you two doing?

592
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,450
What's all the fuss about?

593
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,840
Control your mouth.

594
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,160
Learn from me.

595
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,970
It's ok, Lin Ge.

596
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,490
My grades are not good either.

597
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:23,880
I'm here with you.

598
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,730
How can I compare with you?

599
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:27,450
The coach is impressed by your endurance.

600
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,450
She didn't think much of me.

601
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,840
That's what Nie Chi said.

602
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,400
The coach didn't say it.

603
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,250
Who knows what the coach is thinking?

604
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:34,970
Once the assessment results come out,

605
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:35,930
they may replace me

606
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,490
or send me back.

607
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:38,960
It's fine.

608
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:40,530
We can return to the sports school.

609
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,010
It's good to be back, huh?

610
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:44,050
But I don't want to lose right now.

611
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,600
I don't want to be eliminated.

612
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:48,800
I also don't want to go back.

613
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,290
I don't want to see my dad.

614
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,160
I'll help you find a solution.

615
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,800
I'll train with you all.

616
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:54,850
Let's stay together.

617
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,360
Look at him.

618
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,240
Oh my.

619
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,450
Are you two just acting?

620
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,840
Argue first and then make up.

621
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,560
Now you team up to argue with me.

622
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,490
I'm helping the reason, not the person.

623
00:28:07,770 --> 00:28:08,610
All right.

624
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,890
Lin Ge.

625
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,530
What I said just now didn't mean that.

626
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,290
You're pretty good.

627
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,720
What's good about me?

628
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:20,690
Good personality.

629
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,620
Then you might as well say I look good.

630
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,600
Yeah, you look good too.

631
00:28:27,150 --> 00:28:28,230
Oh my goodness!

632
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,160
It gives me goosebumps.

633
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,120
What's wrong with you, Nie Chi?

634
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,120
You drank alcohol?

635
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,640
You're quite stupid now.

636
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:34,800
You dare to say anything.

637
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,360
She looks good?

638
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:38,290
Get lost.

639
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,690
The coach didn't assess me.

640
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,600
I was quite upset.

641
00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:48,930
What's more, I strained my leg.

642
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,080
So I was in a bad temper.

643
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,250
Don't be angry with me.

644
00:28:52,010 --> 00:28:53,730
It's ok, I'm not angry.

645
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,450
If you have anything unhappy,

646
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,080
just tell me. I'm happy to hear it.

647
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,800
Yes, just scold me if you want.

648
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,400
You want to be scolded?

649
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:03,770
I enjoy it.

650
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:05,960
Continue.

651
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:07,290
More.

652
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:08,800
After you go back,

653
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,360
use the kinesiology tapes to fix it.

654
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,600
I suddenly remember

655
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,050
that I have run out of tapes.

656
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:16,490
I gave the last ones to Zhu Zhu yesterday.

657
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,840
She came back until nine o'clock.

658
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:20,530
When she returned, she could barely stand.

659
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,050
I still have half a roll left.

660
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:23,210
You use it first.

661
00:29:23,290 --> 00:29:24,360
If you need anything else,

662
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,500
I'll give them all together to you.

663
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,360
Thank you, Nie.

664
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:41,290
I'll go out and talk to you.

665
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,130
Wait a minute.

666
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,250
Zhu Zhu, I'll be out to make a call.

667
00:29:47,250 --> 00:29:48,090
I'll be right back.

668
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,050
Nie Chi?

669
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:00,290
Hello, Zhou Yao.

670
00:30:00,290 --> 00:30:01,130
What are you here for?

671
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,690
I'm looking for Lin Ge.

672
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,640
Lin Ge,

673
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,770
someone is looking for you.

674
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,290
I'm coming.

675
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:13,330
You're looking for me?

676
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,050
Didn't you say you ran out of medication?

677
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,360
I brought you some gauze and tapes.

678
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:18,530
That's enough for you.

679
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,690
You are insightful. Thanks!

680
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:22,360
- I'm going back.
- Bye.

681
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:29,330
Zhu Zhu.

682
00:30:29,490 --> 00:30:30,970
Didn't you say you ran out of tapes?

683
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,390
Nie Chi just brought them over.

684
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,530
Let's use them together.

685
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:35,960
Thank you.

686
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:39,000
You're welcome.

687
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:49,100
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

688
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,560
Today's training ends here.

689
00:30:51,080 --> 00:30:52,730
The test results are out this time.

690
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:54,130
Go see it yourself.

691
00:30:58,250 --> 00:31:00,050
Go with me to see the results.

692
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:01,560
Hurry up, why are you so passive?

693
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,720
Hurry up.

694
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,880
Nie.

695
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,690
(Assessment report)
It's me.

696
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,640
This girl...

697
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,600
Lin Ge, don't look.

698
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,560
It seems like you're not in the group.

699
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,250
What? Really? Let me see.

700
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,000
It's here.

701
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,450
(Lin Ge Ranking 2)
It's here.

702
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:23,320
- Passed.
- Passed.

703
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:25,560
-I passed.
- You passed.

704
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,800
I passed. We all passed.

705
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,880
Isn't this something expected?

706
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:33,400
You have also seen your results today.

707
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,250
Overall, you are in the top tier.

708
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,080
You have made great progress.

709
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,190
You skated faster than Zhou Yao today.

710
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,760
This shows that the hard training

711
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,610
was not in vain.

712
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,670
You'll officially stay in the team.

713
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,560
You can start regular training

714
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,090
and participate in the assessment.

715
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,400
Thank you, Ms. Han.

716
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,230
Can I hug you?

717
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,760
All right.

718
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,500
Let me talk about both of you.

719
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,320
Nie Chi's results have always been good.

720
00:32:03,490 --> 00:32:04,560
500m can be your main event.

721
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,460
There are no problems at all.

722
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,680
Follow the previous arrangement

723
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,770
and keep training.

724
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,770
- Fang Chao.
- Here.

725
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,010
You freak me out.

726
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:15,250
Your endurance is great.

727
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,800
I plan to change your main event to 1,500m.

728
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:18,690
Is it ok?

729
00:32:23,970 --> 00:32:25,600
All right. Go back.

730
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,920
Thank you, Ms. Han.

731
00:32:27,770 --> 00:32:28,690
Goodbye, Ms. Han.

732

Goodbye, Ms. Han.

You are really something, Nie Chi.

736
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,250
You actually guessed this right.

737
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:41,160
- I...
- No need to explain.

738
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,320
We cannot understand.

739
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,800
I only know to trust Nie.

740
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,800
Ms. Han's frozen face is no longer a mystery.

741
00:32:47,010 --> 00:32:48,560
Tomorrow is a day off. Let's have some fun.

742
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:50,690
Nie Chi, what do you want to do?

743
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,160
It's up to you.

744
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,360
Listen to me. I'll arrange for it.

00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,200
Let's go.

746
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,660
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

747
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,130
Come in.

748
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:34,890
What's wrong?

749
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,490
Since you said you like it,

750
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,320
I planted it again. It's for you.

751
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:48,690
Where's mine?

752
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,120
It's for you all.

753
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,970
Plant it in the dorm and enjoy it together.

754
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,050
That's ok.

755
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,160
Pretty good.

756
00:34:00,210 --> 00:34:01,840
Has the sand been cleaned?

757
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,840
You got me a head full of sand.

758
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,880
You deserved it.

759
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:08,120
Nie Chi,

760
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,540
come out. I need to tell you something.

761
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:16,970
What are you putting it here for?

762
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:18,160
It can't see the sun.

763
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:21,850
This flower looks like coriander.

764
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,720
Really good.

765
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,080
I finally got the allowance today.

766
00:34:33,450 --> 00:34:34,720
As for the registration fee,

767
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:37,450
could I pay you 50 yuan back each month?

768
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,930
I know it's a bit too little.

769
00:34:39,930 --> 00:34:42,890
But I got no money in the past few months.

770
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,850
I'm a bit drained financially.

771
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,530
Didn't we agree on this?

772
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:48,890
No rush, you can pay me back slowly.

773
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,000
No matter how slow it is.

774
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,050
I can't.

775
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:52,850
I must pay it back as soon as I have money,

776
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:54,970
so I have the motivation to work hard.

777
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,640
I've received your thoughts.

778
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,890
But you can pay me back

779
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,920
until you have money.

780
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,280
What do you mean?

781
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,560
Do you think the money is too little?

782
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:06,930
How about I pay 60 yuan each month?

783
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,120
80 is ok.

784
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,850
I don't lack money right now.

785
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,850
Be more hypocritical when you talk.

786
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,930
Otherwise, you are easy to get a beating.

787
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:21,160
I don't want to see it.

788
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:23,970
Ok, I agree.

789
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,930
But I must pay back the money.

790
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:27,010
How about this?

791
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,810
When you've saved up 2000 yuan,

792
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:29,930
show me your balance

793
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,050
and start paying it back then.

794
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:33,240
50 yuan each month. Is it ok?

795
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:34,760
Let me calculate.

796
00:35:43,010 --> 00:35:43,890
Ok.

797
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:44,760
In this case,

798
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,810
I can pay back most of it in two years.

799
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,370
I'll be going.
