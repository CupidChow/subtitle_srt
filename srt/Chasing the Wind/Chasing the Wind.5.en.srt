My grandma told me a million times

45
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,480
to stay away from you.

46
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,850

Shame on you.

00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,170
Anyway, my grandma said

50
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:33,680
you'd never come home.

51
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,010
Don't ever talk to me again.

52
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:40,240
Shut up. You're so annoying.

53
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,600
It's your turn.

79
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,920
You're over.

80
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,610
Coach, she bullied me!

81
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,310
I hurt my butt!

82
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:45,990

83
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:48,130
Shut up. Stop yelling.

84
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,170
Lin Ge let me fall on purpose.

85
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,850

Get up!

87
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,410
I can't.

88
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,570
My butt is swollen.

89
00:03:55,890 --> 00:03:57,330
I'm not interested in your conflict,

90
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,960
and I don't have time to deal with it.

91
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,330
This is my last warning.

92
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:02,010
Practice or get out of here!

93
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:07,960
I can.

94
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,310
Let's go back.

95
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,650
Bros, try this.

96
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,320
My grandma made it. It's so good.

97
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,680
No. The competition is coming.

98
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,090
You shouldn't eat it either.

99
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:33,330
It might cause trouble.

100
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,170
You really know

101
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,410
how to spoil the fun.

102
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,530
It contains a lot of preservatives.

103
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,770
It can last for a long time.

104
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,360
We'll try it

105
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,530
after the competition.

106
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:47,530
Whatever.

107
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,030
It's so good.

108
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:54,800
Look at this!

109
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:57,070

111
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,290
I just ate

112
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:07,050
a few sausages my grandma made.

113
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,800
I've told you a million times

114
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,150
to be careful with your diet
during the competition.

115
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,360
Yes, coach.

116
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,360
But my grandma said
she bought high-quality meat.

117
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,610
She said it'd be fine.

118
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,240
Are you a new athlete?

119
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,850
How can you not know?

120
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,680
Lin Feng, I gave you so many chances.

121
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,680
Your performance is so poor,

122
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,920
but I've let you stay

123
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,850
and given you a chance to compete.

124
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,410
I've done everything I can.

125
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,370

doesn't have other substitutes

If anything happens

128
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:45,210
to your teammates,

129
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:46,290
what should we do?

130
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,440
Yes.

131
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,050
I understand, coach.

132
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,120
But my grandma said it'd be fine,

133
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,170
so I ate it.

134
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:56,210
You've grown up.

135
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,690

all the time!

buy us dinner tonight.

to take your side

142
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,610
and bully Feng, didn't you?

143
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,320
He can't perform well

144
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,210
in training or competitions.

145
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,120
You even drugged his food.

146
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,880
He didn't pass the test!

147
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,050
What are you talking about?

148
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,530
It was Lin Feng's fault.

149
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,610
Why are you blaming Lin Ge?

150
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,450

151
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,440
Don't touch her!

152

Lin Ge, listen,

153
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,210
Feng is your brother.

154
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:28,830
You can't do this to him!

155
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:31,320
I don't have a grandma
who can't tell right from wrong.

156
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,610
I don't have a brother

157
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,480
who's always hiding behind his grandma!

158
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,920
Move!

159
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:37,850
What are you doing?

160
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,360

Lin Ge just admitted

162
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,320
she set Feng up!

163
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,120
Coach, I didn't say anything.

164
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,290
I didn't set him up.

165
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,610

166

167
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,680
I can separate them.

168
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,770
I'll take Lin Ge home.

169
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,610
Please let Feng stay.

170
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,120
Ms. Han, I'm begging you!

171
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,240
Are you kidding me?

172
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,650
Are you in charge here?

173
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,170
I'm not in charge,

174
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,630
but I'm Lin Ge's grandmother.

175
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,920

00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:01,850
Your grandma is making a scene.

191
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,730
Just give me an answer.

192
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:08,050
Can you not expel my grandson?

193
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,560
No way.

194
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,440
It's not just

195
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,290
because he tested positive.

196
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,770
He's always slacking off.

197
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:15,220
He skipped training many times.

198
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:17,210
No matter how good he is,

199
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:18,480
I can't let him stay.

200
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:19,560
I told you

201
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,320
it was Lin Ge's fault!

202
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:23,050
Lin Feng made a mistake.

203
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,050
Lin Ge is innocent.

204
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,090
You can ask Lin Feng

205
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,770
how many chances we've given him.

206
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,010
Ms. Han, are you saying

207
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,200
we have to leave?

208
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,170
You're bullying an old lady.

209
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,530
I know you're biased

210
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,560
towards Lin Ge.

211
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:44,770
However, if Feng can't stay,

212
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,530
Lin Ge must leave with us.

213
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,560
Otherwise, how can you
compensate us for our loss?

214
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,050
How can we live

215
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:53,600
without the allowance?

216
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,720
I'll compensate you.

217
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,440
From now on,

218
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,010
I'll give you

219
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,920
half of my allowance every month

220
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,370
until I retire.

221
00:09:01,830 --> 00:09:03,170
I'll give you money,

222
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,020
and you can feed your grandson.

223
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:06,170
Stop talking nonsense.

224
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,170
Pack your things and leave!

225
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:11,960
If I leave,

226
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,890
you can't even get
half of the allowance.

227
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,320
Ms. Han, be our witness.

228
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,050
My grandson doesn't want to leave.

229
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,770
You forced him to do so!

230
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,890
Don't forget your promise.

231
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:34,850
Wait a minute.

232
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,580
From now on,

233
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,250
we're not family anymore.

234
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,840
Remember what you said.

235
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,920
Lin Ge.

236
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,280
Coach, sorry

237
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:01,320
for the trouble.

238
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,360
Lin Ge...

239
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,530
Nie Chi, just go.

240
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:29,890
Let's take a walk.

241
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,650
Do you want something sweet?

242
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,180
Okay.

243
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,060
Hold it.

244
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,130
Sister!

245
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,840
Sister!

246
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,320
Sister, are you
the grown-up version of me?

247
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,410
Will I be happy when I grow up?

248
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:11,440
Yes, you'll be happy.

249
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,800
You can skate every day.

250
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,770
You can participate in competitions
and earn prizes.

251
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:19,600
Really, I love skating!

252
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,650
Lin Ge, remember,

253
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,130
you'll face many difficulties,

254
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,980
but you'll get through them.

255
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,650
These experiences

256
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,490
will become

257
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,530
precious memories in your life.

258
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:39,130
What doesn't kill you

259
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,490
makes you stronger.

260
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:44,200
Lin Ge!

261
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:45,960
Coming!

262
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:51,010
Sister, cotton candy.

263
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:10,490
I didn't tell you this.

264
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,170
My mom was the only family I had,

265
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,630
but she died a long time ago.

266
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,680
I believe she's still with me,

267
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,490
but I can only see her in my dreams
from time to time.

268
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,600
I miss her so much.

269
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,800
Mom, look!

270
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,170
It's so beautiful!

271
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,890
Look at that.

272
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:32,960
Ge, you're one year older.

273
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,680
My dad, my brother,

274
00:12:37,290 --> 00:12:38,840
and my grandma are alive,

275
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:41,200
but they're not my family.

276
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:43,800
When Lin Feng was five years old,

277
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,490
he had a fever
that turned into pneumonia.

278
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,600
My grandma went crazy.

279
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,880
She said

280
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,320
they couldn't afford to feed two kids.

281
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,600
She asked a man to take me away

282
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,410
behind my mom's back.

283
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
She sold you?

284
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,200
She said he was our relative,

285
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,600
but who knows?

286
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:11,320
Fortunately, my mom found out

287
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:13,410
and stopped him at the railway station.

288
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:14,890
Otherwise,

289
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,370
I would've been sent
to a mountainous area

290
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:20,290
and lived a hard life.

291
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,890
My mom said

292
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,130
she'd take Lin Feng and me away,

293
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,200
but my grandma wouldn't agree.

294
00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:34,560
So, she only took me away.

295
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,890
Didn't your dad stop her?

296
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,090
My dad?

297
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,720
He didn't care at all.

298
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,130
He didn't even care about Lin Feng,
let alone me.

299
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,800
I don't know where he is.

300
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,320
No wonder Lin Feng is always
talking about his grandma.

301
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,560
Sometimes I'm thinking

302
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,720
if my mom had taken Lin Feng away,

303
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
would he have...?

304
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,680
Never mind.

305
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,890
Life has no turning back.

306
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,800
Since that day,

307
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,200
I've cut ties with them.

308
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,200
You went to Jiangnan, right?

309
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,250
Those were

310
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,920
the happiest years of my life.

311
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,600
However, my mom died of illness,

312
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,370
and I was sent back.

313
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,890
Then I met you.

314
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,920
I've never told you how grateful I am

315
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,670
to have met you, right?

316
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,720
If it hadn't been for you,

317
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:47,050
I would've left home,

318
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,550
and my life would've been so miserable.

319
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,960
We're even.

320
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,680
What do you mean?

321
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,530
If I hadn't met you

322
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,410
and wanted to defeat you,

323
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,370
I wouldn't have kept practicing skating
in Beijing,

324
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,320
and we wouldn't have
met each other again.

325
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:10,770
When we first met,

326
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,440
we changed each other's lives.

327
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,370
We can't choose our blood

328
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,130
or our family,

329
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,170
but we can decide which path to follow.

330
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:23,920
Do you know?

331
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,890
Actually, I'm not sad.

332
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,130
I can finally say goodbye to my past.

333
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,170
I can finally get rid of

334
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,890
my family for good.

335
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,130
Is there anything
you want to do right now?

336
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,770
I want

337
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,290
to try my best

338
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:51,440
to win more competitions

339
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,010
and join the national team.

340
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,010
Let's join the national team together and

341
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,290
become world champions.

342
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,840
I'll be with you.

343
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:28,970
(When I was little,)

344
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,680
(my mom often said,)

345
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:36,560
("Lin Ge, go forward. Don't look back.")

346
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,170
(I never waste time)

347
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,560
(resenting the relatives
who favor boys over girls.)

348
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,130
(I have to let go
of those painful memories.)

349
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,860
(Now we have a sincere promise.)

350
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,820
(Nie Chi)

351
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,500
(Happy New Life)

352
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,320
(For our promise.)

353
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:00,960
(For a brighter future.)

354
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,140
(Happy New Life)

355
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,050
Miss, look around.

356
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:16,490
You can pick one.

357
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:17,840
It's on sale.

358
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:19,840
15 yuan for one, 25 yuan for two.

359
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,530
15 yuan?

360
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,130
Do you like it?

361
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,770
It's too expensive. Let's go.

362
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,080
It's only 15 yuan.

363
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,880
You can buy it for your girlfriend.

364
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,490
Look, 25 yuan for two.

365
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,250
It's more cost-effective for couples.

366
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,290
Why did you buy it?

367
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:50,490
You like it.

368
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,450
But I can buy it online.

369
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,800
Besides, I bet it's less than

370
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,210
5 yuan online.

371
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:57,530
It's different.

372
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:58,970
How?

373
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,360
Today is different.

374
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,450
I want to buy something to celebrate it.

375
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,590
For what?

376
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,290
For our promise.

377
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:13,270
Did you buy both of them?

378
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:20,120
Unscrupulous merchants are rampant
because of people like you.

379
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,450
I've bought them. Just take it.

380
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:26,930
This is mine.

381
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:29,160
What are you talking about?

382
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:31,210
They look the same.

383
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,010
I've never eaten

384
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,320
such delicious cotton candy.

385
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:46,400
It was colorful.

386
00:18:46,690 --> 00:18:48,320
I'll buy it again next time.

387
00:18:52,690 --> 00:18:53,560
Why didn't you

388
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:56,050
reply to me?

389
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:58,640
I didn't notice.

390
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:00,930
How about you?

391
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,440
My phone died.

392
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,160
His expensive phone is fragile.

393
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,840
You're not angry anymore, right?

394
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,730
Chao, luckily, I'm in a good mood.

395
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:30,930
Otherwise, you'd upset me again.

396
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:34,160
It's okay.

397
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,050
I don't care about my grandma anymore.

398
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:36,920
Speaking of family,

399
00:19:36,930 --> 00:19:38,120
I have plenty of family now.

400
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,050
Mr. Fang, Mrs. Fang, and you.

401
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:40,890
Yes.

402
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,010
See? You're not her family.

403
00:19:42,010 --> 00:19:42,850
Is that right?

404
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:44,600
Him?

405
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,730
Of course he is.

406
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,930
I asked around.

407
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,450
I think Lin Feng will be expelled.

408
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,250
I didn't mean

409
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:16,250
to hide it from you.

410
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:17,930
It doesn't matter.

411
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,000
We understand.

412
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:21,320
If I had such crazy relatives,

413
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:22,210
I'd cut ties too.

414
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,010
Do you have

415
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,450
other family?

416
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:31,770
No.

417
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,250
Poor girl.

418
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:37,640
I'm fine.

419
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,480
It's okay.

420
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,730
(Mom)
Hello, Zhu.

421
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,360
Work hard.

422
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,250
We'll visit you in a few days.

423
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,080
Take your training seriously

424
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,560
and get into the national team.

425
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:58,250
Family is not always good.

426
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:12,220
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

427
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:25,970
You must be happy now.

428
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,120
Don't get carried away.

429
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:30,900
Do you still think you were expelled

430
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:32,360
because of me?

431
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,570
Of course.

432
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,490
If you hadn't competed with me

433
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,640
all the time,

434
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,290
I wouldn't have provoked Ms. Han

435
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:39,640
and ended up like this.

436
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,840
I've been hearing
these words all my life.

437
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,050
Aren't you tired of it?

438
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,450
Has it ever occurred to you

439
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:47,210
that you couldn't make progress

440
00:21:47,690 --> 00:21:48,970
because your grandma

441
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,600
didn't keep an eye on you?

442
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:52,800
You're nothing

443
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
without your grandma.

444
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,250
Yes, I'm nothing.

445
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,880
You're so ridiculous.

446
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,440
You don't even have a grandma.

447
00:21:59,450 --> 00:22:00,600
No one cares about you.

448
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,050
No one will visit you.

449
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,210
You can't go home.

450
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,770
Oh, no. I'm wrong.

451
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,530
You don't even have a home.

452
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,120
What else do you have
except for the team?

453
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,160
You're nothing without the team.

454
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:11,560
But I'm different.

455
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,050
After I leave,

456
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:15,400
my life will be wonderful.

457
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,400
Remember,

458
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,880
from now on,

459
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,050
we're not family anymore.

460
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,530
I don't want

461
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:24,120
to see you anymore.

462
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:25,600
You'd better keep in mind

463
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,120
every word you said.

464
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,220
Loser!

465
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:40,900
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

466
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,120
Feng, be careful.

467
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,930
Feng, let me help you.

468
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:49,690
Go away!

469
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:52,490
Come on. Let me help you.

470
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,330
No need!

471
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,770
Feng, let me carry it.

472
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,490
- Stop!
- Fine. I'll stop.

473
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,400
Sit down.

474
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:01,530
Sit down.

475
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,400
Don't touch me!

476
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,360
Come on. Sit down.

477
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,800
Don't touch it!

478
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,730
Now I know

479
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,490
why you're eager to enter a competition.

480
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,220
You want to earn prizes, right?

481
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,790
However, as your coach,

482
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,840
I have to be responsible.

483
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,560
You're not ready.

484
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,640
I know. I'll listen to you.

485
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:27,530
I applied for a special allowance
for you.

486
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:30,840
But I haven't won any competitions

487
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,970
so far.

488
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,080
Why would they approve the allowance?

489
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,290
Besides, the allowance
should be transferred to my card.

490
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,520
Coach, is this your money?

491
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,360
It's a subsidy for members in poverty.

492
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,840
You'll get 3000 yuan next month.

493
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,970
You need this,
so I'm giving it to you now.

494
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,800
Coach, no. I can't take this.

495
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,800
Take it for emergencies.

496
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,930
Come on. Focus on your training

497
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,160
for the competition.

498
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:07,770
I love you.

499
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,770
I'll start training now.

500
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,160
Thanks, coach.

501
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,600
I need to make up a file.

502
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,880
What have I done?

503
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:56,060
(Eating Is Training, Nutrition Is Energy)

504
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,290
It hurts.

505
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,600
Why didn't you hang the panda charm?

506
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,690
I wanted to,

507
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,530
but the hole in my phone was too small

508
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,530
to hang it.

509
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,080
Besides, my hands

510
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:17,080
are shaking too much.

511
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:18,450
I can't do it.

512
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,800
The canteen should serve

513
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:23,080
Xinjiang lamb pilaf.

514
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,250
If I didn't know you,

515
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,800
I'd think you're being sarcastic.

516
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,490
You have many good qualities

517
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:31,800
except for the way you speak.

518
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,730
If you can talk nicely,

519
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,800
you'll be popular.

520
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,530
I don't want to be popular.

521
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,970
I only need you... guys.

522
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:43,120
Nie Chi, it's for you.

523
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,050
You can take mine too.

524
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,770
Lin Ge will have the rest.

525
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,200
Drink it.

526
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:49,770
Drink as much as you want.

527
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,720
Try the chicken leg.

528
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:52,770
Drink it.

529
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:55,690
Your hands are shaking.

530
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:56,970
You laughed at me before.

531
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,640

you're so lucky.

00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,770
Thanks, Zhu.

00:30:36,330 --> 00:30:37,210

621
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,170
Give me one.

622
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,050
- Do you want more?
- It's so good.

623
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:47,920

624
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,580

00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,770
- It's good.
- Try this.

628
00:30:58,980 --> 00:30:59,830
Try this.

629
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,190
I made it. Is it good?

630
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,880
You've eaten too much.

631
00:31:04,290 --> 00:31:06,360
I'm so hungry. I must eat.

632
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,450
You're ridiculous.

633
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,690
- One more.
- It didn't fall.

634
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,290
Let me speak.

635
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,080
You've worked hard this year.

636
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,930
You can take a break,

637
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,290
but only for two days.

638
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,400
The competition is coming.
Don't slack off.

639
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,050
- No problem.
- Okay.

640
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:25,050
Besides,

641
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,670
our old friends are coming.

642
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:27,890
I've confirmed it.

643
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,210
They'll definitely come.

644
00:31:29,210 --> 00:31:30,530
Don't let them down.

645
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,500
- Who are they?
- No problem!

646
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,600
Can't tell you.

647
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,600
It's the rule.

648
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,440
You'll find out.

649
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,490
Five.

650
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:39,440
(Spring Festival Gala)
Four.

651
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,450
Three.

652
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,530
Two.

653
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,840
One.

654
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,800
Happy Chinese New Year!

655
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,930
Happy Chinese New Year!

656
00:31:48,310 --> 00:31:49,780
- Happy Chinese New Year!
- Yeah!

657
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:53,770
Happy Chinese New Year!

659
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,000
Yao,

660
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,530
Ms. Han is never late.

661
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,610
Yes.

662
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,490
Guess why she hasn't come.

663
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,660
I wouldn't ask if I knew.

664
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:22,250
Just wait and see.

665
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,200
Coach.

666
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,450
Let me introduce them.

667
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:36,160
This is Gao Kai and Chao Jinting,

668
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,400
your seniors who are still training

669
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,970
during spring break.

670
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,160
Welcome back from the national team.

671
00:32:43,010 --> 00:32:44,250
Welcome back.

672
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,090
Welcome.

673
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,840
National team? World Champions?

674
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:48,810
So handsome!

675
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,880
You have ten minutes to chat with them.

676
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,580
- What?
- I miss you so much!

677
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:57,960
Is he handsome?

678
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,160
Lin Ge, come with me.

679
00:33:01,290 --> 00:33:02,880
This is Senior Sister Chao Jinting.

680
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:03,770
She used to sleep

681
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,730
on your bed.

682
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:06,400
Hello, Senior Sister.

683
00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:07,840
You're so polite.

684
00:33:07,880 --> 00:33:08,720
- What?
- Not a big deal.

685
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,770
She even bowed to me
when she joined the team.

686
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:11,970
You're handsome.

687
00:33:13,290 --> 00:33:14,290
Indeed.

688
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,290
Junior Sister, it's a blessed bed

689
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,450
for national team candidates.

690
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,210
How's your training?

691
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,800
I've been here for over a year,

692
00:33:22,930 --> 00:33:24,530
but I haven't competed in a real race.

693
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,320
Ms. Han asked me to do basic training.

694
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,840
It doesn't matter.

695
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,250
How about you?

696
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,640
- Same as usual.
- Chao Jinting.

697
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:32,680
Coach.

698
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,770
During your days off,

699
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:35,610
help me train Lin Ge.

700
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,210
She has bad habits.

701
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,690
Help her correct her gestures.

702
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:40,600
No problem. Don't worry.

703
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,050
I'll take care of her.

704
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,260
Okay. Go ahead.

705
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:45,840
Thanks, Senior Sister.

706
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:46,680
It's okay.

707
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:48,320
How have you been?

708
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:50,250
By the way, where's Zhu Zhu?

709
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,800
She's taking a day off.
Her parents came.

710
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,360
What do you think of Zhu?

711
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,010
Can she join the national team?

712
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,320
Zhu Zhu is undoubtedly

713
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:01,410
a good athlete.

714
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,650
However, as for the national team,

715
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,400
I can't guarantee it. No one can.

716
00:34:07,090 --> 00:34:10,120
Her performance was as good as

717
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:11,640
her roommate Chao Jinting.

718
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,810
Why did they choose her?

719
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:15,410
Chao Jinting's main event is 1500m.

720
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,200
She won the competition that year,

721
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,490
and the national team

722
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,120
needed a long-distance skater,

723
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,280
so they chose her.

724
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,490
Should it be short distance this year?

725
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,050
It's Zhu's turn, right?

726
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:29,410
Dad, you don't understand.

727
00:34:29,410 --> 00:34:30,250
Stop.

728
00:34:30,450 --> 00:34:31,560
Shut up.

729
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,760
Ms. Han, Zhu has made
a lot of contributions

730
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:39,530
- to our province over the years.
- Yes.

731
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:41,680
Can you recommend her
to the national team?

732
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:42,530
Yes.

733
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,530
I will recommend her.

734
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:46,200
But the national team

735
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:47,850
has to consider many factors.

736
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,600
Apart from the competition results,

737
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,200
they need to think about
the demand for talents

738
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,010
and the overall strategy.

739
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:55,970
It's complicated.

740

Please take this.

741
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:03,840
It's from our hometown.

742
00:35:04,410 --> 00:35:07,530
Please take care of Zhu.

743
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:10,050
I can't take this.

744
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:12,560
Just a box of fruits. Just take it.

745
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,440
Yes.

746
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:15,410
Only a box of fruits?

747
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:17,530
