how much money do we have left?

70
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,320
We have spent a total

71
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,530
of 372.8 yuan.

72
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,210
372.8.

73
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,880
We still have more than 100 yuan left.

74
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,770
That's good.

75
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,560
Let's go buy some clothes.

76
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
Buy clothes?

77
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,770
Didn't your mom buy you new clothes?

78
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,290
You are going to leave.

79
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,680
Let's go buy the same clothes,

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,650
so we can take a picture

81
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,050

82
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,280

00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,570
Go now.

86
00:05:25,770 --> 00:05:26,920
Did I say that?

87
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,080
You did.

88
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,570
Now that you mention it,

89
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:33,170
I really want to go.

90
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,050
You take this.

91
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,610
Wait for me outside.

92
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:50,610
Why are you being so stingy?

93
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,920
Isn't saving money a good thing?

94
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:54,560
I'm just asking.

95
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:56,420
Mind your own business.

96
00:05:57,730 --> 00:05:58,850
Why can't I ask?

97
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,720
Childish!

98
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:03,750
If we weren't childish,

99
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:04,970
we wouldn't have become acquainted.

100
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:06,770
At our first meeting,

101
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:07,920
you provoked me first, huh?

102
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,530
You bumped into me first just now.

103
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,690
You're more childish.

104
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,080
You are right.

105
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,200
Lin Ge,

106
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,290
I want to ask you something.

107
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,840
What's up?

108
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,170
Why sigh?

109
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,650
Why are you looking so worried?

110
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,560
How can you bear to part with Lin Ge?

111
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,480
Jiangnan is so far away.

112
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:39,480
Can't she join our provincial team?

113
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:42,290
I can only say there's hope.

114
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:43,170
The Jiangnan Team

115
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,680
hasn't produced good talents for a long time.

116
00:06:45,010 --> 00:06:46,770
And they are quite optimistic about Lin Ge.

117
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,530
The conditions they offered are really good.

118
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,880
High salary and foreign teachers.

119
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,730
If it were me, I would be tempted too.

120
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,080
Isn't it?

121
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,900
Moreover,

122
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:00,480
this is

123
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,680
indeed a good choice for Lin Ge.

124
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,400
Yes.

125
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:07,050
This is a big deal.

126
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,050
She has to make her own decisions.

127
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,120
How should she walk the path of life?

128
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,320
We must respect her personal wishes,

129
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,320
right?

130
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:22,930
I want to know

131
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,440
why you want to go to the Jiangnan Team.

132
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,610
The best team is from our province.

133
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:29,130
I know

134
00:07:29,170 --> 00:07:30,480
the Jiangnan Team offers a higher salary.

135
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:32,120
But it's not much higher.

136
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:35,410
Can this money buy your career?

137
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:37,970
Career?

138
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,320
I never thought about a career.

139
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,120
I entered the sports school

140
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,560
just for the bonuses.

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,610
Playing competitions can earn money.

142
00:07:47,730 --> 00:07:49,210
I do everything I can to improve my grades

143
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,830
and strive to participate in more competitions.

144
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,240
You know my situation.

145
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,610
I rely on competitions to make a living.

146
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:58,360
I can't refuse the conditions offered

147
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,800
by the Jiangnan Team.

148
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,480
Anyway,

149
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,240
my grades may not be enough

150
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,970
to get me into our provincial team.

151
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,800
Why not seize the 100% opportunity

152
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,070
right in front of me?

153
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,610
Grabbing a little more is better.

154
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,770
You have a career to consider.

155
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:13,690
I'm happy for you.

156
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:16,170
I am thinking about survival first.

157
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,880
I don't think there's anything wrong.

158
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,920
Let's just talk about money.

159
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,170
There are the national teams above.

160
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,440
If you stay in a provincial team,

161
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,320
you're more likely to enter the national team.

162
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:29,900
By then,

163
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,410
you can not only receive a salary,

164
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,440
but also get an allowance.

165
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,720
If you win the world championship,

166
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,720
a prize of hundreds of thousands is possible.

167
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:38,600
Nie Chi,

168
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:40,370
do you know there is an athlete

169
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,890
named Zhu Zhu in our provincial team?

170
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,760
I have heard of her.

171
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,370
Her best time for 500m

172
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,530
is 45s.

173
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:49,000
The average time for the team is 47s.

174
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:50,250
Do you know my grade?

175
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,200
My time can't even be less than 48s.

176
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:56,010
For an athlete,

177
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,680
a strong opponent

178
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,370
can better inspire his potential.

179
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,800
Your talent is better than mine.

180
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,920
I knew it the first time I met you.

181
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,840
At that time, none of my peers

182
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,130
at the sports school

183
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,370
could skate better than me.

184
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:08,970
But you

185
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,130
could catch up with me

186
00:09:10,310 --> 00:09:11,290
wearing figure skating shoes.

187
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:13,440
More than that.

188
00:09:14,290 --> 00:09:15,770
I surpassed you.

189
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:19,010
Ok, surpass me.

190
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,250
In order to win,

191
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,840
you directly hit the line with your body

192
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,130
and flew out.

193
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,960
That was the first time I saw

194
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,410
someone is so competitive.

195
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,170
You didn't even care for your life.

196
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,250
I want to prove I can skate faster than you.

197
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,600
I were happy to fall too.

198
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,440
You are so competitive.

199
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,320
If you want to skate faster,

200
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,440
you should try out for our provincial team.

201
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,440
I know you don't like hearing this.

202
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,370
But if it's because of the money,

203
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,650
2,000 yuan for the training camp...

204
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:51,370
- I can help you.
- Stop wasting money.

205
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,720
I'm not going to outer space.

206
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,410
Let's keep in touch more often.

207
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:55,960
Maybe during vacations,

208
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,800
I'll be back to Master's place to stay over.

209
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,330
Let's go.

210
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,290
Lin Ge.

211
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:03,490
Do you like skating?

212
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,600
Stop being disgusting.

213
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,050
Answer me.

214
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,200
Where did you hide the money?

215
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:17,130
Didn't your mom leave you any money.?

216
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,130
-I have no money.
- Why let her come back?

217
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,720
Food and drinks don't cost money?

218
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,080
Water and electricity don't cost money?

219
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:27,070
I like it.

220
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,560
But for some things,

221
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:34,840
liking is not enough.

222
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,490
Let's go.

223
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
(Once a person is born with dreams,)

224
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,080
(he will willingly embark)

225
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,010
(on a more difficult path to pursue it.)

226
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,080
(But no one knows)

227
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,720
(whether he will go further)

228
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,250
(or fall even harder.)

229
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:56,410
(Dreams)

230
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,740
(are too heavy for my life.)

231
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,510
(Everyone sees the pain of my reality)

232
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:03,710
(and understand my pragmatism.)

233
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,440
(Only Nie Chi)

234
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:07,680
(saw the suppressed flames in my heart.)

235
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,960
(But he not only kept his mouth shut,)

236
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:13,320
(but also poured a bucket of gasoline on it.)

237
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,420
(Agreed)

238
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,220
(Training Camp Registration Form)

239
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:25,800
(Excellent Coaching Staff)

240
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,290
Master, you want to meet me?

241
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,330
Come in.

242
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,800
(IOU)
Take it.

243
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:33,130
What can I say about you?

244
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,320
You paid 2,000 yuan so casually.

245
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,680
I hurriedly went to the finance dept,

246
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,800
but I failed to get it back.

247
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,920
What should we do now?

248
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,380
You still won't accept an IOU.

249
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,930
What do you mean?

250
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,860
(IOU)

251
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,840
It is my own decision.

252
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,370
I don't want you to pay me back.

253
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,720
If you don't let me pay you back,

254
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,690
then I won't go.

255
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,080
Anyway, you can easily

256
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,370
help me pay the money.

257
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,800
I guess you aren't short on cash either.

258
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,290
Just let your money

259
00:11:58,290 --> 00:11:59,190
go to waste.

260
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,560
Wait a minute.

261
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,440
As long as you can go, I listen to you.

262
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:06,200
Paste the IOU properly.

263
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,680
Exactly the same.

264
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:09,930
I'll stick it after I go back.

265
00:12:10,130 --> 00:12:10,970
Just do it right now.

266
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,600
I'm waiting for a reply from Jiangnan.

267
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,850
As long as they agree,

268
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:16,840
I'll pack my things.

269
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:19,960
In short, once I earn the allowance,

270
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,600
I will slowly pay you back.

271
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,890
It doesn't matter how slow it is.

272
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,200
I won't forget it.

273
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:27,720
No matter how slow it is.

274
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,260
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

275
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,260
(Comprehensive Training Hall)

276
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:55,720
Where did you get the money?

277
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,770
Anyway, I didn't spend your money.

278
00:12:58,170 --> 00:13:00,050
Aren't you going to Jiangnan Team?

279
00:13:00,130 --> 00:13:01,200
Why come to the training camp?

280
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:02,960
I ranked third individually in the league.

281
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,290
There are many teams I can go to.

282
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,320
None of your business.

283
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,050
You are really something.

284
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,200
Can you stay away from me?

285
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,040
Stop trying to imitate me.

286
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,880
You are thinking highly of yourself.

287
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,380
If you find me displeasing, then go away.

288
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,460
I haven't finished talking yet.

289
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,540
You are really something.

290
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,060
- I really encourage you.
- Get lost.

291
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,750
I'm telling you,

292
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,180
you are really something.

293
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,260
What's the matter, Lin Feng?

294
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:27,900
You miss me, don't you?

295
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,820
There is an old saying,

296
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,380
a wise man avoids immediate losses.

297
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,140
Is everything all right?

298
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,260
It's ok.

299
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,100
It's fine, huh?

300
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,880
We just asked someone.

301
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,110
My dad was right.

302
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,460
As soon as we get here, we have to compete.

303
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,330
So fast?

304
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,540
Is there no coaches or someone like that

305
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:48,540
to come out and say something?

306
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,260
It is said that Coach Han Bing

307
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,540
is pragmatic like this.

308
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,540
Hello, Ms. Han.

309
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:58,540
(Speed Skating)

310
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,780
Hello, Ms. Han.

311

(Training Camp Ice Training Base)

312
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:26,780
That one is Zhu Zhu.

313
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,940
The fastest one in the provincial team.

314
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:37,060
Women's 500m. Get ready.

315
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,380
Ms. Han.

316
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:45,020
Lin Ge wanted to challenge Zhu Zhu.

317
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,380
You want to challenge Zhu Zhu?

318
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,700
Yes, I want to challenge her.

319
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,540
Ok.

320
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,660
Today we won't judge based on rankings.

321
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,420
It all depends on everyone's scores.

322
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,180
Your time should be less than 48s.

323
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:12,420
And then I will consider you.

324
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,540

Come on.

328
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,650
Come on.

329
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:49,350
Hurry up.

330

Come on.

336
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,060
- Hurry up.
- Keep it up.

337
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:11,700
Come on.

338
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,030
Hurry up, hurry up.

339
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,690
Come on.

340
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,140
Hold on.

00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,640
Hurry up.

00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,660
Come on.

344
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,540
Go, Zhu Zhu!

345
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,140

Come on.

348
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:42,620
Remember the time.

349
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,540
Second.

350
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,180
Pretty good, she's the second.

351
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:48,310
Set.

352
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,820
Now I announce the competition results.

353
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,660
First place, Zhu Zhu.

354
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,100
46.67s.

355
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,540
Second place,

356
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,200
47.97s, Lin Ge.

357
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,500
Less than 48s.

358
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,300
Less than 48s.

359
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,460
I passed.

360
00:17:08,840 --> 00:17:10,720
Let's call it a day.

361
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,520
Lin Ge.

362
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,380
Wait a minute.

363
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:18,990
Ms. Han.

364
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,220
What are you so happy about?

365
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,740
You're so far behind the first place.

366
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:24,980
Do you think it's an honor?

367
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,260
Small potato.

368
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,360
Do you know what the average score is?

369
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,260
47s.

370
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,300
You haven't even reached the average score.

371
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:38,340
Is this all you demand from yourself?

372
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,980
Your grades are quite good among your group.

373
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,140
But your center of gravity,

374
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,940
the squatting angle, all of it is wrong.

375
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:49,860
Physical fitness and endurance are average.

376
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,500
With someone like you,

377
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,500
you might stand out in a team in the south,

378
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:54,980
but in here,

379
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,460
you are nothing.

380
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,260
I'm stating this clearly.

381
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:02,580
As long as your grades meet the standards,

382
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,260
I will naturally accept you.

383
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,420
But you must

384
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,260
practice from scratch.

385
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:11,900
There is a girl at your school who

386
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:13,320
caught the attention of the Jiangnan Team.

387
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,180
It's you, right?

388
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,250
But I haven't made my decision yet.

389
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,020
The Jiangnan Team wants you.

390
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,440
What did you come here?

391
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,100
You just want to give it a try, huh?

392
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,540
Looks like I'm just a backup.

393
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,780
You should go to the Jiangnan Team.

394
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,060
I think that's quite suitable for you.

395
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,740
Let's go, Lin Ge.

396
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,460
Actually, the coach is right.

397
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,660
If not, you can go to the Jiangnan Team.

398
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,420
But my movements are all wrong.

399
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,740
The movements are wrong.

400
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,370
Maybe the Jiangnan Team

401
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,060
are not strict with movements.

402
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,770
Don't be discouraged, Lin Ge.

403
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,040
Which boy do you think is better?

404
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:19,740
No. 3 who got second place.

405
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,180
He has the best foundation.

406
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,580
Nie Chi.

407
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,460
But he seems to be a bit timid.

408
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,700
He had several chances to surpass others,

409
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,540
but he didn't do that.

410
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,020
He indeed has issues in this regard.

411
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,260
Let's observe him more.

412
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,380
Ms. Han Bing.

413
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:36,680
Do you have anything to say?

414
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,260
Ms. Han, can I stay in the team?

415
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:40,690
On my way here,

416
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,050
I have already declined the Jiangnan Team.

417
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,660
I have left myself no way out now.

418
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,060
If it is not ok,

419
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:46,660
I can train for another year in my school

420
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,740
and apply for the team next year.

421
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,100
Why do you want to stay?

422
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,940
I am unreconciled.

423
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,380
You've made up your mind?

424
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,350
I have.

425
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:58,460
All right, I'll give you three months.

426
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,220
Assess you after three months.

427
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,500
Only if you pass can you stay in the team.

428
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,260
Ok, after three months,

429
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:06,910
I will definitely be able to stay here.

430
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,190
Thank you.

Come on, babies.

447
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,500
Dumplings make the wine better.

448
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,820
Come on.

449
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,060
What's going on?

450
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
They also drink wine?

451
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,190
They're about to join the team soon.

452
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,700
Let's have a drink to celebrate.

453
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:17,940
Come on.

454
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,740
Just a sip. Is it ok?

455
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,340
A sip.

456
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,420
- Congratulations to you.
- Here.

457
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,260
You are about to join the provincial team.

458
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:26,500
Congratulations to myself

459
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:29,240
for teaching three promising good students.

460
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,580
You never forget to praise yourself.

461
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,740
This is originally my credit.

462
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:37,320
- Exactly.
- You also contributed to this.

463
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,540
Eat dumplings while they're hot.

464
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,780
Come on.

465
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,860
Dad, look.

466
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,220
These dumplings look really ugly.

467
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,580
They must be made by Nie Chi.

468
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,420
You think it's ugly? Give it to me.

469
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:58,260
The more you eat, the uglier you'll become.

470
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,180
How is it?

471
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,100
Delicious.

472
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,260

00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,260
How come there's a coin?

474

Good, good, good omen!

475
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,740
I shouldn't give it to you.

476
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,020
I regret it, Mom.

477
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,340
Come on.

478
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:19,700
I wish my babies all the best,

479
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,260

Where are Lin Ge and Nie Chi?

496
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,180
Lin Ge said she was hot after drinking

497
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,100
and wanted to go out for a walk.

498
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,980
Nie Chi accompanied her out.

499
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,960
My son is sleeping like this.

500
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,340
Why not lift him up?

501
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,500
I tried but couldn't move him.

502
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,840
My silly boy.

503
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,940
When can you wake up?

504
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:23,060
You will regret someday.

505
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,020
Oh my.

506
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:26,820
What's wrong, son? Come up quickly.

507
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,740
You scared me.

508
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,180
Don't drink anymore, Dad, stop drinking.

509
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,020
No more drinking.

510
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,680
Well,

511
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,780
what do you mean just now?

512
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,860
What will he regret?

513
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,260
Lin Ge.

514
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,220
I didn't say I wanted to eat ice cream.

515
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,340
Aren't you hot?

516
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,540
Put it on your face.

517
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,020
Why did I not think of that?

518
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:08,460
Much better.

519
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,180
Mrs. Fang.

520
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,450
This is the old one.

521
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,260
I know you don't accept a new one.

522
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,220
You take this. I will buy a new one.

523
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:29,940
After washing your hair, make sure to dry it.

524
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,580
Girls' heads can't get cold.

525
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,780
Easy to fall ill.

526
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:35,180
Mrs. Fang.

527
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:38,900
Good girl.

528
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,740
You know,

529
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,020
when I was pregnant with Fang Chao,

530
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,980
I wish it would be a daughter,

531
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,020
so I could braid her hair

532
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:51,260
and buy her pretty clothes.

533
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,460
But I never expect that it was a boy.

534
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,780
I just want

535
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,460
to fulfill these wishes on you.

536
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,580
But you don't want to buy anything.

537
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:04,020
When I earn money in the future,

538
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:05,420
I will buy it for you.

539
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,020
We can wear outfits like sisters.

540
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,740
Isn't that just a generation apart?

541
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,580
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)
(Today, we welcomed some new members.)

542
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:19,390
(First of all, on behalf of the team)

543
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,460
(and the old members,)

544
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:23,060
(I would like to warmly welcome your arrival.)

545
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,940
(Over the years, the team has been)

546
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,020
(a stronghold in winter sports,)

547
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,180
(supplying many outstanding athletes.)

548
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:33,500
(In the future, there will certainly)

549
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,180
(be more outstanding talents)

550
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:37,340
(emerging from among you.)

551
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:41,180
(You're the hope of short track speed skating.)

552
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,340
(I believe that you will be able)

553
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,800
(to carry forward the glorious traditions)

554
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,060
(of Songbei in your future training)

555
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,260
(and competitions.)

556
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,140
Feng,

557
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,940
don't eat alone.

558
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,540
Share it with your roommates.

559
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,140
Do you want it?

560
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,540
Mrs. Lin,

561
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,340
the coach doesn't allow us to eat these.

562
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,260
There may be problems with the doping test.

563
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
They are just overthinking it.

564
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,660
We just arrive and won't compete.

565
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:23,580
Who will check you?

566
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,420
Exactly.

567
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,460
Eat a little less, it's not a big deal.

568
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:27,730
By the way,

569
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,540
I even made sausage myself at home.

570
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,820
Don't worry.

571
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,660
I picked the meat piece by piece

572
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,900
in the market.

573
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,460
It's all good meat.

574
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,260
You guys share it.

575
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,660
Come here.

576
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,540
Just go in. Nothing wrong.

577
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,740
We're all here.

578
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:49,700
She won't do anything to you.

579
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,660
I'm not afraid of her.

580
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,580
I don't want to see her.

581
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,740
This is the night light I bought.

582
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,740
Buy one, get one free.

583
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,700
I give you one.

584
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,020
Whoever needs it can use it.

585
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,780
I am leaving.

586
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,020
(Comprehensive Training Hall)

587
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,020
Let me introduce myself.

588
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:18,260
I am your head coach, Han Bing.

589
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,580
I am assistant coach, Ding Yi.

590
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,180
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

591
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,900
Today is your first day in the team.

592
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:25,540
First, we'll conduct physical fitness test.

593
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,340
All of you take the test together.

594
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,260
Let's wait for the test results.

595
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,820
Warm up first.

596
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,060
Let's go. Warm up first.

597
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,180
Lin Ge, wait a moment.

598
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,700
What's the matter, Ms. Han?

599
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,700
Skip the test.
You practice the foundation first.

600
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,020
Why can't I take the test?

601
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,460
Don't you understand?

602
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,660
You practice the foundation first.

603
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,090
How long do I need to practice?

604
00:27:47,430 --> 00:27:48,900
Practice until I say it's ok.

605
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,380
Quick, quick, quick.

606
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,740
The speed is a bit slow.

607
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,960
Quick, quick, speed up.

608
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:15,670
Hurry up.

609
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:21,020
Quick, quick, quick.

610
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:22,260
Quick, quick, quick.

611
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,940
Hurry up.

612
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,980
Speed up.

613
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,740
Quick, quick, quick.

614
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:29,940
Speed up.

615
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,180
Control the rhythm.

616
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,420
Hurry up.

617
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,060
I think the coach is right.

618
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:54,980
Your foundation is indeed weak.

619
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,980
Is there anything else? Just say it.

620
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,180
I can stand it.

621
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,700
I want to let you know

622
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,400
the coach is paying attention to you.

623
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,020
When you are doing basic training,

624
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,020
the coach has been observing you.

625
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,060
Continue.

626
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,780
She occasionally looked at you,

627
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,940
writing and sketching in her notebook.

628
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:12,060
- So...
- So, you mean

629
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,740
she has high hopes for me.

630
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,300
I think it is.

631
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,450
Nie, good job.

632
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:25,410
Got it.

633
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,180
Oh my.

634
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,740
Why perform such a grand ceremony?

635
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:01,180
Hello.

636
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,580
I just dropped my phone.

637
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,580
- I'm picking it up.
- It's fine.

638
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,660
I'm kidding.

639
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:07,340
Come here.

640
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,660
I was too busy in training to tell you

641
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,500
that she just has that kind of temper.

642
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,540
Don't take it to heart.

643
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,060
I'm the only one in the whole team

644
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:17,060
who can tolerate her.

645
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,420
That's why there's an empty bed in this room.

646
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,820
It's fine.

647
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,700
I used to know someone

648
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,020
who didn't like to talk and looked cold,

649
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,220
but she is really nice.

650
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,420
Well, you have experience.

651
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,500
Maybe you can stay here a bit longer.

652
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,340
Yeah.

653
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,300
The bathroom lights are kept for you.

654
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,820
See? How overbearing she is.

655
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,020
She must turn off the lights to sleep.

656
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,340
If I want to watch a show,

657
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,980
I have to watch it under the covers.

658
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:54,220
You've cleaned up quite neatly.

659
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,020
Zhu Zhu, look at Lin Ge's night light.

660
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,500
It looks quite nice.

661
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,340
Zhu Zhu,

662
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,780
why not take a look at my night light?

663
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,180
Go to bed early.

664
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,420
Tomorrow will be even more intense.

665
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:11,300
Thank you, Zhu Zhu.

666
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,210
(She truly is my idol.)

667
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
(She's so disciplined.)

668
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,300
(Sleep! Sleep!)

669
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,580
Nie.

670
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:39,780
Where did you get such a pink thing?

671
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,500
Lin Ge sent me it.

672
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,660
Come on, you want everything, huh?

673
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,940
You are not picky.

674
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,900
Doesn't this thing look annoying?

675
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,500
Why does it look so annoying to me?

676
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,980
When I sleep at night,

677
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:53,980
I will close my eyes.

678
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,300
Mainly during the day,

679
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:57,500
you put such a cute thing

680
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,540
in our dorm.

681
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,540
What the hell!

682
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,460
Sleep.

683
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:15,260
Lin Feng, hurry up.

684
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,700
Soon. You guys go to sleep first.

685
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,700
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

686
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,700
It's hard to get a day off.

687
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:26,940
Where are you taking me?

688
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,540
We'll be there soon.

689
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,700
I still want to practice

690
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:31,020
the squatting angle later.

691
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,860
Practice more?

692
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,260
I'm feeling anxious.

693
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,060
I haven't had any results during this time

694
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,360
and can't participate in the assessment.

695
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,270
In the past, I think

696
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,500
having the lowest score is the worst.

697
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,060
Now I realize

698
00:32:42,180 --> 00:32:43,980
that having no results is the worst.

699
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,650
At least you will know

700
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,340
whether you've made progress or not.

701
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,420
Only I am left in the dark.

702
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,060
You want to plant flowers?

703
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,470
Don't you like to plant flowers?

704
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,060
This is a viola bulb, right?

705
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:03,600
I shouldn't have bought the wrong one.

706
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,350
Didn't the seller tell you

707
00:33:06,590 --> 00:33:07,980
it isn't the season for planting flowers?

708
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,900
This is frozen soil.

709
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,760
You, a person from the north,

710
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:12,100
don't have as much common sense as I do.

711
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,100
How do you plan to dig this ground?

712
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,660
Dig a little bit at a time.

713
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,660
I can excavate a hole.

714
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,100
Then what? Dig, water, and freeze.

715
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:22,040
Are you planning to freeze it?

716
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,820
What should I do?

717
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:26,580
Plants have their own growth patterns.

718
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,040
Sow in spring, reap in autumn. No hurry.

719
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:31,910
Since you already know,

720
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:33,490
why are you in such a hurry?

721
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:37,020
Again. Again.

722
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:39,370
You even add a little story this time.

723
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:40,570
You've really made progress.

724
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,890
I took several days to come up with it.

725
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,020
I even went to the market to buy props.

726
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,660
I'm somewhat sincere, I guess.

727
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:51,100
It's a waste of money.

728
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,420
For the sake of money,

729
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:56,220
could you let me finish my main point?

730
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:59,490
Say it. Whether I listen or not is up to me.

731
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,280
I've seen Ms. Han Bing's notebook.

732
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,610
What? You peeked at the coach's notes?

733
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,990
She showed it to me.

734
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,620
She recorded your every performance

735
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,210
and made analysis as well.

736
00:34:12,610 --> 00:34:14,040
She doesn't seem to give up on you.

737
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:15,940
Why did she show you the notes?

738
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,180
She showed me my own score curve,

739
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,500
so I turned a couple more pages.

740
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,240
Turn more pages?

741
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,500
We have different personalities.

742
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:27,280
I can objectively see my performance,

743
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,380
while you may feel anxious.

744
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,340
Whether the coach showed me the notes

745
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:33,020
or refused you to take part in the assessment,

746
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,220
she aimed to improve our grades.

747
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,660
You think the coach doesn't like you,

748
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,780
but if she really doesn't like you,

749
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,820
she won't do data analysis for you.

750
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,460
When we were at the sports school,

751
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,060
our relationship with the coach was too good.

752
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,860
We always bargained.

753
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,460
This is a bad habit that needs to be changed.

754
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,220
So what should I do now?

755
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:56,890
Trust the coach.

756
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,620
Believe her one hundred percent.

757
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,270
Do whatever she says.

758
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,980
This is also the only way.

759
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,660
Then I'll give it a try.

760
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,500
(Key focus for March 2016)

761
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,940
(Songbei Province Ice Sports Base)

762
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:33,620
(Temper Will and Strive for First Place)

763
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:37,860
(Train Hard to Improve Weaknesses)

764
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,340
(Show Yourself and Strive for New Heights)

765
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,460
Today's training ends here.

766
00:35:48,700 --> 00:35:50,500
Everyone, time for cooling-down.

767
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,940
(Lin Ge, good speed, poor foundation)

768
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,380
(Fang Shizhong)

769
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,420
What's wrong, Han?

770
00:36:19,660 --> 00:36:20,500
It's so late at night.

771
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:22,020
Did Fang Chao cause trouble?

772
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,060
No, your son is doing quite well.

773
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:25,980
Strong muscle strength, good endurance.

774
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,900
He's a good candidate for long distances.

775
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,660
I'll observe him more

776
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:31,940
and consider whether to let him skate 1,500m.

777
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,020
Nie Chi is also a good kid.

778
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,020
Strong explosive power, fast starting speed.

779
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,180
He has a particularly good ice feel.

780
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:39,890
He has no problems with short distances.

781
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,060
Isn't this pretty good?

782
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:42,540
I just want to ask you

783
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:45,030
