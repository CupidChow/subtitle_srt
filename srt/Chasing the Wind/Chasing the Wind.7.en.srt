Wait for me in the national team.

31
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,170
It has hurt for many days.

32
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,090
Was it caused by the wrong squatting angle?

33
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,840
Maybe the time for making an arc is too long.

34
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,450
If I could join the national team with you,

Why not solve it in a different way?

49

Ms. Han, you won't not help me, will you?

50
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,240

I always have time.

54
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:38,960

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,920

At the age

75
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,920
when peers would cry over scraped knees,

76
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:21,480
he had already left his parents

77
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,010
and entered the sports school alone

78
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,520
to undergo rigorous training.

79
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,460
(Gifted in youth)
In adolescence

80
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
that is troublesome for parents,

81
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,200
he went through a brutal selection process

82
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,360
to join the provincial team

83
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,760

on training.

85
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,890

00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:37,610
in every competition

87
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,850

This is our senior Gao Kai.

99
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,640
He is now the captain of the national team

100
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,050
and also the world champion in the 500m.

101

102
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,410
Yes.

103
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,850

when it comes to contribution and value,

108
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,730

No matter what the reason is,

113
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,880
I did not keep my promise

114
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:31,290
to study abroad.

115
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,440
It is my fault.

116
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,970
I apologize to you.

117
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:35,610
I'm sorry.

118
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:37,730
Mrs. Nie, you may not know yet,

Gao Kai is optimistic about Nie Chi.

120

He believes Nie Chi will definitely make it.

121
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,440
After hearing you would take Nie Chi abroad

122
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,730
and let him give up,

123
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:47,290
he rushed back to persuade Nie Chi to stay.

124
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,560
I really love short track speed skating.

125
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,320
When I was a child,

126
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:52,920
you have arranged everything for me.

127
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,680
Only when I was on the ice,

128
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,320
I feel free

129
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,530
and I feel that my life is under my control.

130
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,770
I like skating.

131
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,880
Just like you love your own career.

132
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,000
If one day someone

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,980
forcibly changes the path of your life,

134
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,920
what are you going to do?

135
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,650
Nie Chi is a very,

136
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:16,000
very good short track speed skater.

137
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,440
His future is quite bright.

138
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,970
If he gives up at this moment,

139
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,440
it would be really a pity.

140
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,120
Is Nie Chi

141
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,530
really as excellent as you say?

142
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:27,970
- Absolutely.
- Absolutely.

143
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,320
Nie, well...

144
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,880
I'm well-know for cherishing my body.

145
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,650
Because I want to keep going.

146
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,730
I assure you

147
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,610
I will never get injured.

148
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,640
So,

149
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,970
do you want me to continue?

150
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,770
Son, what's your ultimate goal

151
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,770
to choose the short track speed skating?

152
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:58,320
I want to join the national team.

153
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,970
I want to become a world champion,

154
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,480
a top short track speed skater in the world.

155
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,090
Good boy!

156
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,610
Ok.

157
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,480
Then let's make another agreement.

158
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,880
If you can make it within a year,

159
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,120
I will let you continue it.

160
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,730
If not,

161
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:18,470
you will obediently study abroad.

162
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:21,580
I am reasonable, right?

163
00:06:22,290 --> 00:06:23,970
The logic is simple and direct.

164
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,320
But I promise you.

165
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:28,880
Lin Ge, you are really a good girl.

166
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:30,530
You are talkative.

167
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,070
And you understand Nie Chi well.

168
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,480
- What's your ranking?
- I like you.

169
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:35,880
First or second, I guess.

170
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,240
Really?

171
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,480
Let's keep in touch more often.

172
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,290
You need to report

173
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,090
every move of Nie Chi to me.

174
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,440
All right, Mrs. Nie.

175
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,520
Then I'm leaving.

176
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,360
Please be safe on the road.

177
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,780
Goodbye.

178
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,290
Let's go.

179
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,770
It turns out

180
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,650
communication is more effective, right?

181
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:06,810
Yes, it is.

182
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,410
Sometimes I feel that

183
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,770
communication is just wasting energy.

184
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,800
Whether it is the matter with Huang Han

185
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,440
or the matter with my parents this time,

186
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,520
it's all the same.

187
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,090
Do you enjoy the sweet taste this time?

188
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,770
It's all thanks to your good presentation

189
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:19,840
and precise positioning.

190
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,730
The plan is just right for my dad.

191
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,880
Luckily, you understand me.

192
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,170
Without you,

193
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,530
it seems to be the same as before.

194
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,320
You seem particularly eager about my matters.

195
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,000
You really want to help ease

196
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,680
the relationship between my parents and me.

197
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,720
Yes.

198
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:38,080
Why?

199
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:39,560
Because

200
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,610
hating your own family

201
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:44,050
is a painful thing.

202
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:46,090
I don't want you and your parents

203
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,240
to take a step that is irreparable.

204
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,610
Do you know

205
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,920
I'm quite envious of you?

206
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,800
I also want my family to watch me compete.

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,920
But all the people who loved me have left.

208
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,150
Don't talk about it anymore.

209
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:01,210
I almost forgot the important matter.

210
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:02,680
What's the matter?

211
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:05,050
The round-trip tickets for Gao Kai,

212
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,730
the hotel expenses he spent,

213
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,050
including expenses for food and drinks.

214
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,920
And also the money for the presentation.

215
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,560
When are you free to reimburse it?

216
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,290
Does the presentation also cost money?

217
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,350
Of course.

218
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,610
Nie, let me tell you,

219
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:22,650
Lin Ge is truly a hero this time.

220
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,120
She has been very busy,

221
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,740
making the presentation,

222
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,650
inviting Gao Kai,

223
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:29,290
and planning all of this.

224
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,970
You should sincerely thank

225
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,440
me.

226
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,320
I pulled the curtains

227
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:38,530
and turned on and off the lights.

228
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,080
I also turned pages.

229
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,770
How important my work is.

230
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,920
Once I get stuck on my work,

231
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,530
then the whole process will be ruined.

232
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,560
Anyway, don't think you can fool us

233
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:49,530
with such a meal.

234
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,370
Fine.

235
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:51,920
I'll treat you both to a meal outside.

236
00:08:54,370 --> 00:08:56,490
But let me tell you honestly,

237
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,800
you really need to hurry up.

238
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:59,410
You have already promised your parents

239
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,050
that you must make it within a year.

240
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:02,560
If you can't make it,

241
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,220
when your dad and mom come next time,

242
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:06,250
no matter how well we perform,

243
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:07,090
it's useless anyway.

244
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,800
The Starlight Cup is a common hurdle for us.

245
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:15,530
Let me toast to Lin Ge first.

246
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,050
My work is very important.

247
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:19,970
Together.

248
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,050
Zhu Zhu, you're still practicing so late.

249
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:05,840
Aren't you also here

250
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:07,410
for extra practice at this late hour?

251
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,440
Is your leg injury healing up well?

252
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,800
It's almost healed.

253
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,800
That's fine.

254
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,370
I'm going to practice on the machines.

255
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,440
All right, you go ahead.

256
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
Nie Chi.

257
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,770
45s.

258
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,250
My time is finally less than 45s.

259
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,840
- Really?
- Thank you so much.

260
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,650
What are you thanking me for?

261
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,720
It's about making arcs when turning.

262
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,630
How did you come up with it?

263
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,530
It's not me.

264
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,920
As soon as I learned this during turns,

265
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,600
my speed really improved a lot.

266
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,680
If I practice this more,

267
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,490
my grades can continue to be improved.

268
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,440
Because my legs hurt when turning.

269
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:04,720
Maybe the time for making an arc is too long.

270
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:07,130
The longer it is, the slower the speed is.

271
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:08,530
And the legs easily get sore.

272
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,920
So that's the reason.

273
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:22,960
If you practice hard,

274
00:11:23,170 --> 00:11:24,130
there will be breakthroughs.

275
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:25,530
I think so too.

276
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,920
Where's Fang Chao?

277
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,440
I want to tell him this good news.

278
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:31,050
Zhu Zhu, are you going back?

279
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,290
I'll go with you.

280
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:35,840
What's wrong with Zhu Zhu?

281
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,560
Zhu Zhu,

282
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,320
at the training ground last night...

283
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,530
What happened last night?

284
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,610
I don't remember.

285
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,050
We must take the Starlight Cup seriously.

286
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,560
- Yes, yes.
- And the start...

287
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,400
Huang Han.

288
00:11:58,890 --> 00:11:59,730
Come and sit here.

289
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,410
What are you doing? Together?

290
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:07,770
Take your time. I'll go find Fang Chao.

291
00:12:08,050 --> 00:12:08,890
All right.

292
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,170
I will go over there.

293
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,250
The coach just met me.

294
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,440
Guess what she said to me.

295
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,960
She asked me to coordinate with Nie Chi.

296
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,170
I think she is right.

297
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,130
These guys are improving too fast now.

298
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,720
We, the old team members,

299
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:32,170
must prioritize the bigger picture,

300
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,250
to support and protect the younger ones.

301
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,250
Isn't my current mindset really good,

302
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,890
just like a big brother?

303
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,440
Huang Han.

304
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,410
I am not you.

305
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,600
I will not miss any opportunity.

306
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,370
Don't say it anymore.

307
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,200
The following

308
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,370
is the women's 1,500m final.

309
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:02,960
The athletes are warming up actively

310
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:03,960
on site.

311
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,370
What should I do?

312
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,170
There is someone in Jiangbei Team

313
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,390
who is notorious for her dirty play.

314
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,840
Don't be nervous.

315
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,600
Just perform as you usually do in training.

316
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
How could I not be nervous?

317
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,320
This is my first time in a major competition.

318
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,890
I've seen that person's videos.

319
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,170
She even pushes her own teammates.

320
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,440
Really scary!

321
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:23,680
I know her.

322
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,560
Her absolute speed is inferior to you.

323
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,290
Shake her off at the beginning. It'll be fine.

324
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,890
The coach said the same thing.

325
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,250
Oh no, I'm still nervous.

326
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,850
You continue. I'm going to the restroom.

327
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:23,890
Zhu Zhu.

328
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:25,730
Zhu Zhu.

329
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,200
Do you have a bending tool?

330
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,370
No.

331
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,160
45s.

332
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,080
My time is finally less than 45s.

333
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,130
How did you come up with it?

334
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,290
Since I learnt this,

335
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,130
my speed really improved a lot when turning.

336
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,640
Zhu Zhu, are you ready?

337
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:09,010
The opponents are very strong.

338
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,490
Don't exert too much during warm-up.

339
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,650
Save your strength.

340
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,340
Ok.

341
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:19,070
What are you talking about?

342
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:20,680
My idol is concerned about me

343
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,290
and also teaches me competition techniques.

344
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,380
Where have you been?

345
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,250
I brought you the bending tool.

346
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:27,920
Don't worry. It's fine.

347
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,080
Just focus on the competition.

348
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:36,490
Don't think about anything else.

349
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,800
I'm off.

350
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,890
My idol is concerned about me

351
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,560
and also teaches me competition techniques.

352
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,410
Don't exert too much during warm-up.

353
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:10,530
Save your strength.

354
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,840
It's really a pity.

355
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,410
Huang Han from the Songbei team

356
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:18,650
is a strong contender for the gold medal.

357
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,600
This collision is very unfortunate.

358
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,890
His expression shows he is in great pain.

359
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:24,320
I hope it won't affect

360
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:25,600
the level of competition in the future.

361
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,290
Next is the exciting

362
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,770
women's 500m final.

363
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,530
A contest of speed and passion.

364
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,370
The athletes have now begun

365
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:46,560
warm-up on the field.

366
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,200
Was Huang Han all right just now?

367
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,440
Hope everything is fine.

368
00:16:50,770 --> 00:16:52,080
- Hello, Mr. Li.
- Hello, Mr. Li.

369
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,040
It's him.

370
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,170
Hello, Mr. Li.

371
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,290
- Hello, Mr. Li.
- Hello, Mr. Li.

372
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,180
Hello, Mr. Li.

373
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,250
Coach Li Haifeng.

374
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,530
Master is correct.

375
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:09,250
Li Haifeng comes here to find good players.

376
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,880
That makes me even more nervous.

377
00:17:12,210 --> 00:17:14,050
Next is the list of finalists.

378
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,050
Number 8 Lin Ge from Songbei Team.

379
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:18,320
Number 6 Zhu Zhu from Songbei Team.

380
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,530
Number 16

381
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:21,080
Yu Miao from Jiangbei Team.

382
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,640
Number 2 Fu Haixin from Jiangnan Team.

383
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,080
It will be a very intense competition.

384
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:26,530
Let us hold our breath and wait.

385
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:27,450
Ready!

386
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,840
Now they have come to the first corner.

387
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:46,120
Currently, the one in first place

388
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,250
is Lin Ge from Songbei Team.

389
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:48,450
Yu Miao is in second place.

390
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,970
Fu Haixin is in third place.

391
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,600
Veteran Zhu Zhu is in fourth place.

392
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,050
Is this a tactic?

393
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:56,050
Lin Ge is quite aggressive today.

394
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:58,210
She started even faster than Zhu Zhu.

395
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,840
Suppress.

396
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,600
This is the instruction

397
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,840
from the coach of Songbei Team.

398
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,730
This is given to the young skater Lin Ge

399
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:08,860
who maintains the temporary lead.

400
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,250
I hope she can maintain

401
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,600
the first place in the competition.

402
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,840
Where is the veteran Zhu Zhu?

403
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,840
What about the championship favorite?

404
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,210
She is still behind in the competition now.

405
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:19,320
And she is in the last position.

406
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:20,680
We said earlier it is a tactic.

407
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,050
Sure enough, it works.

408
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,270
She has surpassed the third place.

409
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,650
- Suppress!
- A very beautiful overtaking.

410
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:27,290
She seized the opportunity in the curve.

411
00:18:27,690 --> 00:18:29,080
So she is now in third place.

412
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:31,120
But the match is already halfway through.

413
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:33,450
The live display shows the match is halfway.

414
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,080
There are only two laps left.

415
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,450
For the veteran Zhu Zhu,

416
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:37,970
does she still have the strength

417
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:39,690
and desire to push forward?

418
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:42,600
Lin Ge is working hard to extend the lead.

419
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,560
The last lap, the final opportunity!

420
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,730
Let's take a look at the veteran

421
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:46,810
Zhu Zhu.

422
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,530
It is obvious that she is still accelerating

423
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:50,480
with all her might.

424
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,600
That curve again.

425
00:18:54,210 --> 00:18:55,450
It's the last chance.

426
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:56,290
The final lap.

427
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,620
Can the championship favorite

428
00:18:57,690 --> 00:18:59,530
work miracles again?

429
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,210
An unexpected incident happened.

430
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,680
She fell.

431
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,930
She could only watch Lin Ge

432
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:10,050
sprinting through the finish line.

433
00:19:11,730 --> 00:19:12,770
Young skater Lin Ge

434
00:19:12,770 --> 00:19:15,120
finally won the championship.

435
00:19:16,050 --> 00:19:17,840
This is her first national competition.

436
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,050
Let us congratulate her.

437
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,160
(In competitive sports, the winner takes all.)

438
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:32,400
(The spirited person)

439
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,840
(will make others look particularly dull.)

440
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,800
(A relaxed posture)

441
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,770
(will also leave those trailing behind)

442
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,360
(in a more awkward state.)

443
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,530
(At that time I thought)

444
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,120
(that I had a bigger stage.)

445
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:47,690
(When I ran desperately)

446
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,050
(in order to fulfill the promise,)

447
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:52,840
(I was unaware of having already triggered)

448
00:19:53,290 --> 00:19:54,770
(the trap disguised as care.)

449
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:04,360
Why don't you go congratulate Lin Ge,

450
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:05,640
yet take the time to watch my joke?

451
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,200
Zhu Zhu,

452
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,930
did you tamper with Lin Ge's skates?

453
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,210
I don't understand what you're saying.

454
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:22,880
You told Lin Ge to warm up slowly,

455
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:25,940
to prevent her from noticing this problem.

456
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,240
So what?

457
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,050
At the start,

458
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,690
with your ability,

459
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,210
you definitely won't be the last place.

460
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,940
You were waiting for her to fall, right?

461
00:20:40,970 --> 00:20:42,600
It would be best to take down a few more.

462
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,800
Then you can surpass them.

463
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,690
You must have watched too many movies.

464
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,400
When did she fall?

465
00:20:57,990 --> 00:20:59,290
She took first place.

466
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,010
She didn't fall

467
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,290
because I asked her to change skates.

468
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:08,330
Lin Ge,

469
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,530
change to another skates.

470
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:11,160
It will bring you good luck.

471
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:23,800
At that time, there was only you here.

472
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,360
Before I went get the bending tool,

473
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,010
I tightened all the screws.

474
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,730
But now the screws of Lin Ge's skates

475
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,690
are all loose.

476
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,450
If you have solid evidence,

477
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,400
then show me.

478
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,730
If not, then shut up.

479
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:39,920
Get lost.

480
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,770
Do you need me to check the monitor?

481
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,290
Lin Ge admires you so much.

482
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,840
How can you do that?

483
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:56,350
When you took my things

484
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,450
to flatter Lin Ge

485
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,080
and trampled me to please her,

486
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,490
did you not feel it was unfair to me?

487
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,640
Because my legs hurt when turning.

488
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,690
Maybe the time for making an arc is too long.

489
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:12,330
45s.

490
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,080
My time is finally less than 45s.

491
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,830
It's about making arcs when turning.

492
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:17,600
Since I learnt this,

493
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,210
my speed really improved a lot.

494
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,120
At that time in the training ground,

495
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,970
I went there to help Lin Ge.

496
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:25,320
Then why didn't you tell me?

497
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,690
If you said you are helping Lin Ge,

498
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,120
I wouldn't say a word.

499
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,400
Nie Chi,

500
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,840
I am originally a rival of Lin Ge.

501
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,600
She wants to enter the national team. Me too.

502
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,400
You know she is improving little by little

503
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
while I am in the valley.

504
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,930
But you use my techniques to help her.

505
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:48,600
Have you considered my feelings?

506
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:52,560
Why are you doing this?

507
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,210
Hope I could join the national team with you.

508
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,560
(The team decided)

509
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,400
(to suspend Zhu Zhu from training)

510
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,290
(and impose a one-year ban from competition.)

511
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,490
(As for this matter,)

512
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,840
(Zhu Zhu has made a profound reflection)

513
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,160
(and applied to leave the team.)

514
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,560
(But I want to forgive her.)

515
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,250
(In competitive sports,)

516
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,050
(there may not necessarily be a reward.)

517
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,210
(Anyway,)

518
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:44,770
(we all need the courage to start over.)

519
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:05,970
Zhu Zhu, Han asked me to give you it.

520
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,640
How is he doing?

521
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,010
Why don't you go see him?

522
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:14,970
Han doesn't know you are leaving.

523
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,800
Zhu Zhu, I'm going.

524
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,840
Here.

525
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:33,810
He's asleep.

526
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,690
What brings you here?

527
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:41,400
We come to see you.

528
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,360
Nothing to see.

529
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:44,610
I'm fine.

530
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Han, how's your waist now...

531
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:48,800
My waist...

532
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,530
My waist is fine. Nothing wrong.

533
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:53,770
I feel like I can fly right now.

534
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,360
Before you came in,

535
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,320
I dreamt I was flying high up in the sky.

536
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,290
Very high!

537
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:01,120
I haven't congratulated you yet.

538
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,690
Congratulations!

539
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,250
Thank you, Han.

540
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,120
I...

541
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:11,800
I'm really fine.

542
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,600
I just can't skate anymore, that's all.

543
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,060
But

544
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,120
I still have basic self-care skills.

545
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,930
Eating, drinking,

546
00:25:21,290 --> 00:25:22,130
nothing will be affected.

547
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,050
Actually, for athletes,

548
00:25:26,210 --> 00:25:28,770
such things are inevitable.

549
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:31,320
You must maintain a good mindset.

550
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:32,810
We're still young.

551
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,690
As long as we can wear skates for a day,

552
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:38,360
we will cherish that day.

553
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:40,290
But you all must know

554
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,360
we all have to take off them

555
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,770
sooner or later.

556
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:46,840
That's real life.

557
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,560
That's the most part of our days.

558
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:52,000
Got it, Han.

559
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,120
Take a good rest.

560
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,730
By the way, how is Zhu Zhu doing?

561
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:01,770
She didn't get a good score this time.

562
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:03,400
She must feel very upset.

563
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,970
Lin Ge, please comfort her.

564
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:08,600
Think of a way.

565
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,880
Please do me this favor.

566
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,690
She

567
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,930
is very stubborn on the surface.

568
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:17,120
If you try to coax her,

569
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,640
she is not happy yet.

570
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,160
You do me this favor.

571
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:22,690
When I get discharged,

572
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,640
I will thank you all,

573
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:26,530
sincerely thank you.

574
00:26:46,530 --> 00:26:48,840
Happy birthday, Zhu Zhu.

575
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:52,080
I've thought about it for a year.

576
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,840
But I decided to give them to you.

577
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,290
I saved up money for several months

578
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,210
to buy this.

579
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,290
I...

580
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,690
When I was hurt, I saw your expression

581
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:03,690
and I received it.

582
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,970
Thank you for caring about me.

583
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,640
But unfortunately,

584
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,560
I must say goodbye to you.

585
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,450
I...

586
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,160
I can no longer be the man

587
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,010
who stands alongside you.

588
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:20,400
Let's just be friends.

589
00:27:21,660 --> 00:27:24,840
Lin Ge says I'm not suited to be a lover,

590
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,250
but I am good as a friend.

591
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:28,050
Why don't you think about it?

592
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,600
Anyway, you don't have feelings for me.

593
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,930
Finally, I wish you a happy birthday.

594
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:40,600
Not just on your birthday, though.

595
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,210
You should be happy every day.

596
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:53,210
Oh my, my waist.

597
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:54,880
What brings you here?

598
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,560
Why is it so severe?

599
00:27:58,050 --> 00:27:58,930
Well,

600
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,970
you really surprised me.

601
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:05,740
I am fine.

602
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,740
It's just a small crack in the bone.

603
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:16,060
I received the shoes and the note.

604
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,100
Thank you.

605
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,260
Can't you skate anymore?

606
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:28,740
I guess.

607
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,660
But it's nothing important.

608
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:34,020
I'm a leader-type person.

609
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,940
I can live well wherever I go.

610
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:39,500
Why are you being so unreasonable?

611
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,820
You just slipped on the field.

612
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,500
When it comes to being injured,

613
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,580
there's no reason to discuss.

614
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,700
Some people look

615
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,020
like they fall really hard,

616
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,740
but actually they are fine.

617
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,020
I

618
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,100
fell on my butt.

619
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:58,980
I thought there was nothing going on.

620
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:01,100
On the ice rink,

621
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,180
isn't it all just a matter of an instant?

622
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,900
An instant.

623
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,580
In an instant, we may never skate anymore.

624
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,940
That's true.

625
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:16,860
Huang Han,

626
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:22,700
I came here today to say goodbye to you.

627
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:25,940
What's going on?

628
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,700
What happened to you?

629
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:31,900
I'm fine.

630
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,780
I just don't want to stay here anymore.

631
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,020
I want to change the environment.

632
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:37,900
Where are you going?

633
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:41,060
I haven't thought it through yet.

634
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,220
Well, this...

635
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,740
It's quite sudden.

636
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:48,260
It caught me off guard.

637
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:55,340
I guess it will be difficult

638
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:00,020
to meet in the future.

639
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,540
Nothing.

640
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,500
It's nothing. I mean

641
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,900
transportation is so advanced now

642
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,900
and communication is convenient.

643
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:15,460
It's not hard to get in touch or meet up.

644
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,020
Promise me one thing, ok?

645
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,220
After you leave,

646
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:24,980
no matter what you do,

647
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:25,940
you must

648
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:29,580
take good care

649
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,200
of your old knee injury.

650
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:34,850
I promise you.

651
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,180
Thank you, Huang Han.

652
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:47,500
You are welcome.

653
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:50,740
