Since I went to the sports school,

79

I've stopped blowing out the candles.

It's been eight years,

90

that I started to be greedy.

But you know I'm not good at
expressing myself.

97
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,360
So, I wrote a letter.

98
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,680
It took me many days.

99
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:01,930

102
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:18,730
why didn't you tell me you liked Wei?

Aren't we friends?

104
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,420
I don't like her.

105
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,360

106
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,340

00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,200
You looked at her affectionately.

111
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,720
It's not just my assumption.

112
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,250

114
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:42,920
that look was affectionate.

115
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:45,810
But I was looking at you.

116
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,010

117
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,080

00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:01,890
You were there when they interviewed me.

00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:07,370

121

maybe you can't accept it now.

00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,560
But I have to

127
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,320
let you know I like you.

128
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,800
You don't need to respond to me now.

129
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:40,250
So, don't be nervous.

130
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,320

you can share families and friends,

146
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,080

227
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,890
I came back to take something.

228
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,410
Oh my god. It's so beautiful!

229
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,440
Let me look it up.

230
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,200
It's more valuable than my feet.

231
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,010
Why are you still looking at it?

232
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,080
Are you going to sleep?

233
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,370
- I'll turn it off.
- No need.

234
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,800
Jinting helped me install

235
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,450

00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:09,330

00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,450
Isn't it amazing?

239
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:23,560
He gave me two light bulbs.

240
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:25,800
He asked me to tell him
when the first one is broken,

241
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,800
and he'll prepare another one
in advance.

242
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,360
I think it's great.

243
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,120
You don't have to get up to turn it off

244
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,080
so that you won't catch a cold.

245
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,690
Lin Ge, you're still up.

246
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,970
You haven't placed the skates.

247
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,080
I'll turn it on.

248
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,880
No need. I'll go to sleep soon.

249
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,080
Okay, suit yourself.

250
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:47,680
Okay.

251
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:49,160

You're back.

254
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,490
Why did you practice this late?

255
00:18:19,770 --> 00:18:20,770
I'll take a shower.

256
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:39,180

Have you tried the skates? Do they fit?)

257
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:51,490
Have you tried the skates? Do they fit?

258
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,730
Not yet. They'll produce little skates.

259
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,200
No need to wait.

260
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:09,290
I'll buy you a pair of skates
every year.

261
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,970
No. It's too expensive.

262
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,800
It's late. There's training tomorrow.

263
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:21,640
Happy birthday.

264
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,640
Good night.

265
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,020
Good morning.

266
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:44,890
Good morning.

267
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,490
I need to tell you something

268
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,690
before the training.

269
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:05,120
After careful observation,

270
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,330
the coaching staff decided

271
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,050
to let Nie Chi

272
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,210
become a formal member
of the national team.

273
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:16,800
Congratulations.

274
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:26,450
Okay. The training begins.

275
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,760
Congratulations.

276
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:31,880
- Let's go.
- You made it.

277
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,730
Why are you still wearing
the old skates?

278
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,930
The new skates are so expensive.

279
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:39,360
I'll save them for big occasions.

280
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,290
What is a big occasion?

281
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,400
The Winter Olympics?

282
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,690
Wear them in the Youth Championship.

283
00:20:49,690 --> 00:20:50,530
Fang Chao.

284
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:57,290
What's going on?

285
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,840
He's been ignoring me
since the morning exercise.

286
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,440
Chao.

287
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:16,600
Shouldn't we have lunch together?

288
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,250
What's wrong? Why are you angry?

289
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:20,530
The flowers you sent me
are so beautiful.

290
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:21,690
I took a picture.

291
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:23,530
- Really?
- Look.

292
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:28,450
I really had a great time
on this birthday.

293
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,770
You're happy?

294
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,290
I'm glad you're happy.

295
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,530
I'm happy too.

296
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,560
You wanted to tell me

297
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,530
something last night, right?

298
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:41,530
Lin Ge.

299
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,880
Can I ask you a question?

300
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,160
Go ahead.

301
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,840
Did you say yes to Nie Chi?

302
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,050
Did he tell you?

303
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,010
Did you say yes?

304
00:21:58,880 --> 00:21:59,800
I...

305
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:00,770
It's okay.

306
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,770
Last night, I just wanted

307
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,930
to say happy birthday to you.

308
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,880
It was your 18th birthday,

309
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,930
so I wanted to make it formal.

310
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,490
Okay, got it.

311
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,970
Let's have lunch.

312
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,560
My legs are not feeling well.

313
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:19,930
I pushed myself too hard.

314
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,970
I'm a little uncomfortable.

315
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,250
I'll go back and handle it.

316
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,050
You should go. It's okay.

317
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,960
Uncomfortable?

318
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:28,570
You...

319
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,680
Lin Ge.

320
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:53,770
Happy birthday.

321
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,730
Wish you happiness every day.

322
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,050
It's your birthday.

323
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,250
I'd like to take this opportunity

324
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,840
to express my feelings.

325
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,560
We went to the sports school,

326
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,560
the provincial team,

327
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:08,690
and the national team together.

328
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:10,770
I gradually realized

329
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,860
my life was full of sunshine.

330
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:15,290
We grew up and hung out together

331
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,530
every day like brothers.

332
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,730
We had so much to talk about.

333
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,530
However, I didn't realize

334
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,210
you'd been

335
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,120
important and irreplaceable

336
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,120
in my heart.

337
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,120
Not until now

338
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,080
have I realized

339
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,600
the reason I want to see you every day

340
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:39,930
is because I like you.

341
00:23:40,770 --> 00:23:41,880
Therefore, Lin Ge,

342
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,840
I've finally made up my mind to tell you

343
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,360
I like you.

344
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:48,450
I've liked you for a long time,

345
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,080
and I won't stop.

346
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,050
Please be my girlfriend.

347
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,120
The same group of people, right?

348
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,290
Before and after

349
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,250
the Winter Olympics?

350
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,000
Got it.

351
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,210
I'll tell them. We'll be cooperative.

352
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,690
Don't worry.

353
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:20,160
They filmed us so many times.

354
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,490
We're numb.

355
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:25,530
Yes, we'll show our energy and spirits.

356
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,450
We're just numb to cameras and reporters

357
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:32,530
instead of training.

358
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,800
Okay. Send it to my WeChat.

359
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:37,570
No problem.

360
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
What filming?

361
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,600
Same as usual,

362
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,360
just some boring questions.

363
00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:47,730
It might affect
Xie Lingwei and your training.

364
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,880
Mr. Li

365
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:51,260
is about to lose his temper.

366
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,840
I heard

367
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,210
he argued with our manager.

368
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,370
We have to

369
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,500
cooperate with the publicity.

370
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,200
Never mind.

371
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,640
What's wrong?

372
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:06,850
Nothing.

373
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,560
I shouldn't go
to the girls' dorm this late.

374
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,730
I'll tell them on WeChat.

375
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,490
When did you become so mature?

376
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,730

377
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:16,530
Last time, I knocked on
Chao Jinting's door at 10:30 p.m.,

378
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,020
and she nearly killed me.

379
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:18,860
(Send)

380
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,210
You deserved it.

381
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,060
(Group Chat)
Gosh.

382
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,530
So dramatic. What's wrong?

383
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,730
Nothing. I made a mistake.

384
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,060
(Here's the filming notice.
I created a group by accident.)

385
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,900
(Leave the group after reading it,
understand?)

386
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,640
Gao Kai is so stupid.

387
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,690
Jinting, it's not a big deal.

388
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,970
I didn't know a mass message
would create a group.

389
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,640
It's obvious that he didn't want

390
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,080
Chen Mingyuan to see it.

391
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,050
He was too lazy to send it to everyone

392
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,700
and accidentally created a group.

393
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,490
Look what he's done.

394
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:12,530
Everyone has found out
he'll set Chen Mingyuan up.

395
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:15,490
I didn't see Chen Mingyuan in the group.

396
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,400
Did he leave the group

397
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,800
after reading it?

398
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,120
Nie Chi isn't there either.

399
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,810
I screenshot it immediately.

400
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,290
Jinting,

401
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,050
you're really a gossip expert.

402
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,130
So, what's going on

403
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,210
with Chen Mingyuan?

404
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,690
Why did Gao Kai set him up?

405
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,210
Set up? Who was set up?

406
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,080
What are you talking about?

407
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,250
What is it?

408
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,320
Well, this is a very long story.

409
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,640
Once upon a time,

410
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:47,690
Chen Mingyuan and Yu Siyang got together

411
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,360
in the provincial team

412
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,800
and joined the national team together.

413
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,880
They were an enviable

414
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,530
perfect couple.

415
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,840
And then? Go on.

416
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,600
But the relationship
affected their performances.

417
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,080
Chen Mingyuan was 17 or 18 years old,

418
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,200
very talented.

419
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,250
Mr. Li wanted him

420
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,880
to lead long-distance events,

421
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,400
whereas Siyang wasn't that lucky.

422
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:15,600
There were many talented female skaters.

423
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,010
Mr. Li split them up.

424
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,880
What happened?

425
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,320
Chen Mingyuan stayed in the team,

426
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,320
and Siyang had two options,

427
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,560
college

428
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,530
or provincial team,

429
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,840
and she went to college.

430
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:31,640
Didn't they resist?

431
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:33,560
How?

432
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,400
They weren't Romeo and Juliet,

433
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,640
and Mr. Li was the king.

434
00:27:38,210 --> 00:27:40,400
Besides, if they retired together,

435
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,770
would over ten years of practice
be worth it?

436
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:45,560
They'd both been trained
for over ten years.

437
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,530
Why did it have to be Siyang?

438
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,610
Exactly.

439
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,210
Speaking of which,
here's the cruelest part.

440
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:56,450
When Siyang left,

441
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:59,930
she said in front of everyone,

442
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,050
"You're carrying on our dream.

443
00:28:04,530 --> 00:28:06,160
If you can't win the Olympic Games,

444
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,690
my departure will be meaningless."

445
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:11,010
Oh my god.

446
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,490
Olympic champion.

447
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:16,450
That was such a high goal.

448
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:18,880
It's said

449
00:28:19,050 --> 00:28:20,560
he had the chance

450
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,360
to make it before 21 years old,

451
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:25,080
but he was so unlucky

452
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,400
that he got injured
before two Olympic Games.

453
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,290
He came here at the age of 17

454
00:28:29,450 --> 00:28:31,400
but didn't go to the Winter Olympics
until he's 26.

455
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:34,600
It's not his best days anymore.

456
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:37,450
They were both professional athletes.

457
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:38,930
Why would the relationship

458
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,600
affect their training?

459
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,120
Love makes people

460
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,490
blind and emotional.

461
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,930
At their age, anyone would want
passionate love.

462
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,530
If Mr. Li waited for them for two years,

463
00:28:51,530 --> 00:28:52,640
maybe they'd be stable.

464
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:55,290
There are a lot of talents.

465
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,360
No one will wait for you.

466
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,930
If you fail, you'll leave.

467
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,250
However, Mr. Li is not always cruel.

468
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,120
When you're good again,

469
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,290
he'll invite you back.

470
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,250
So,

471
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:09,110
Gao Kai doesn't want
Chen Mingyuan to find out

472
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,840
Siyang is coming tomorrow.

473
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:12,880
Yes.

474
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,360
He ran away last time, didn't he?

475
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:20,250
There'll be a great show tomorrow.

476
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,120
Okay, enough.

477
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:27,360
Gossip time is over. Go to sleep.

478
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:30,450
Let's wait and see.

479
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,290
Bye, Jinting.

480
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,840
As the team leader,

481
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,120
do you think it's stressful

482
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,640
to unite old and new teammates?

483
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,880
It's definitely stressful.

484
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,840
However, we're a team.

485
00:29:41,970 --> 00:29:43,290
It's the old athletes' duty

486
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,160
to help and guide the newcomers.

487
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,970
Only when the team is stronger

488
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,800
can everyone make bigger progress.

489
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,640
Siyang

490
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,880
said in front of everyone,

491
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,970
"If you can't win the Olympic Games,

492
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,960
my departure will be meaningless."

493
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:58,880
As we know,

494
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,780
we're very likely to win gold medals
in short track speed skating.

495
00:30:02,130 --> 00:30:03,320
To secure our success...

496
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,690
I'm looking at Siyang.

497
00:30:04,690 --> 00:30:06,160
Stop sighing.

498
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,880
Well, don't worry about it.

499
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,970
I was telling you not to overthink it.

500
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,450
Apart from Mr. Li's assignments...

501
00:30:11,450 --> 00:30:12,690
I'm wondering what kind of

502
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,450
videos they'll make based on

503
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,800
the interview of Xie Lingwei and me.

504
00:30:16,130 --> 00:30:17,080
As for preventive measures...

505
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,840
If they want a hot topic,

506
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:19,860
they'll try their best

507
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:21,770
to make all kinds of videos.

508
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,390
- We'll do our best.
- Why didn't they make videos of us?

509
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:25,840
I believe in you.

510
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:27,690
So, this is the end

511
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:29,120
of the interview.

512
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,440
Okay. Thanks.

513
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:31,570
Do your best.

514
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,730
Siyang, who else do you want to talk to?

515
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,050
I remember Xie Lingwei
did well last time,

516
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,080
but she was nervous.

517
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:44,010
I want to talk to her.

518
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,250
Xie Lingwei.

519
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,830
Xie Lingwei.

520
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,560
Xie Lingwei!

521
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,880
She's young.

522
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:55,160
She's cute.

523
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:58,220
- Hi.
- Hi.

524
00:30:59,080 --> 00:30:59,920
Well, Mr. Li,

525
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:02,600
why don't we find a partner for her?

526
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,450
I remember that boy did well.

527
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,240
Nie Chi, right? Nie...

528
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,160
Brat.

529
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,360
Coach, can Lin Ge come?

530
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,450
They're roommates

531
00:31:14,450 --> 00:31:15,400
and friends.

532
00:31:15,530 --> 00:31:16,490
Okay.

533
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:18,320
Wei is a little nervous,

534
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,640
so maybe she can answer more questions

535
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,970
with someone by her side.

536
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,770
Lin Ge, come on.

537
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:26,490
This is Lin Ge. This is Yu Siyang.

538
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,400
Hello, Senior Sister.

539
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:28,640
I remember you were

540
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,290
looking at me last time.

541
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:32,520
Because you're pretty.

542
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:33,930
Sweet girl.

543
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,530
Go ahead. I have work to do.

544
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:36,370
Okay.

545
00:31:36,690 --> 00:31:37,730
Sit down. Don't be nervous.

546
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,570
Okay.

547
00:31:43,290 --> 00:31:45,360
Wei, you were nervous last time.

548
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,160
Your roommate

549
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,720
is here by your side.

550
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:49,970
Are you feeling better?

551
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,640
Well, Lin Ge, let's start with you.

552
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:53,840
How have you been

553
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,930
since joining the team?

554
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:57,770
To be honest,

555
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:59,320
many things have happened.

556
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:01,600
It's stressful to serve
the national team.

557
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,770
Luckily, we're like a family.

558
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,370
Go!

559
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,290
Okay, I got it.

560
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,130
I can walk.

561
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:15,890
Don't run.

562
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,770
- You're the last one.
- No.

563
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,210
We've been waiting for you.

564
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:26,160
You're here.

565
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,880
They've never seen each other
since then?

566
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,850
It's been eight years.

567
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,050
He's been too ashamed to see her

568
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,320
because of his failure.

569
00:32:35,690 --> 00:32:37,970
Siyang gave up
short track speed skating.

570
00:32:37,970 --> 00:32:39,160
That's such a pity.

571
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,250
Their relationship

572
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:42,120
destroyed her athletic career.

573
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:43,330
That was cruel.

574
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,800
It's not Mr. Li's fault.

575
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,400
We need self-control,

576
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,240
understand?

577
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,360
I... I didn't see you

578
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:53,490
last time.

579
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:55,120
I thought you wouldn't come.

580
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,930
What... do you want to say?

581
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,560
I want to say

582
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:04,570
I'm sorry.

583
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:05,970
It's been eight years.

584
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:09,400
Sorry, I couldn't fulfill the promise.

585
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:13,530
So, I want to...

586
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,800
You... don't have to apologize.

587
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,690
I know it hasn't been easy for you

588
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,320
over the past eight years

589
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:22,120
because I used to be an athlete too.

590
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:25,560
Mingyuan, I only hope

591
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:28,120
you can seize this opportunity.

592
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,840
Keep fighting. Don't give up.

593
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,560
I won't miss my last chance.

594
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:50,050
(National Ice Sports Base)
(Dating under Mr. Li's nose)

595
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:51,640
(is a dead end,)

596
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,450
(and confession of love
is seeking death.)

597
00:33:54,970 --> 00:33:56,930
(However, my rationality
pulled me back.)

598
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,640
(If I leave the national team,)

599
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,640
(I'll lose everything.)

600
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,730
Lin Ge,

601
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,290
are you going to sleep on the floor?

602
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,240
Why would I?

603
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,970
You've been on the floor

604
00:34:11,970 --> 00:34:13,080
all night.

605
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:15,970
I wanted to exercise,

606
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,490
but I had so many thoughts

607
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,400
that I got on the floor somehow.

608
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,450
How could I do this?

609
00:34:22,850 --> 00:34:24,230
I knew I had to train,

610
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,760
but I didn't do anything.

611
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,200
Lin Ge, you're making me confused.

612
00:34:36,370 --> 00:34:38,080
(Let me go, hormones.)

613
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:40,010
(I haven't said yes.)

614
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,240
Lin Ge, I bought breakfast.

615
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:52,530
I'm going to be late.

616
00:34:52,810 --> 00:34:54,530
But you have to eat breakfast.

617
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:56,760
Here. I bought all kinds of bread.

618
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,850
Here's milk.

619
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,560
And this.

620
00:35:00,050 --> 00:35:01,490
Well, I...

621
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,160
You also have to eat. Bye.

622
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:04,280
Don't forget to eat it.

623
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,530
Fang Chao, what are you doing?

624
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:14,120
You're drinking water, right?

625
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,440
Lin Ge.

626
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:24,850
Nie Chi's here.

627
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,720
But I want to talk to you.

628
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,280
Why are you ignoring him?

629
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,410
No.

630
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,160
How's your training?

631
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,970
It's... good. How about you?

632
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,720
We're good.

633
00:35:44,930 --> 00:35:45,850
We?

634
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,080
You're good?

635
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:49,970
Stop kidding.

636
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,240
I'll go back to training.

637
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,080
Lin Ge.

638
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,010
Don't follow me.

639
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:02,760
Is there anything you want to tell me?

640
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,640
I'm also doing well in training.

641
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:13,850
Good.

642
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,040
Okay.

643
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,760
Lin Ge, what's wrong?

644
00:36:42,530 --> 00:36:44,050
Starting reaction is your strength.

645
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,120
You lost it.

646
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:49,330
Mr. Li, give me another chance.

647
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:51,890
You're distracted.

648
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,010
Adjust yourself.

649
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,490
Why are you shaking?

650
00:37:10,050 --> 00:37:11,120
Are you injured?

651
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,440
No.

652
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:14,080
What's on your mind?

653
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,520
Hold still.

654
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,250
You too!

655
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,490
Concentration!

656
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:25,640
What's wrong with you guys?

657
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,480
You two,

658
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:31,410
