Good morning, Lin Ge.

Wei.

51
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,720
Wei,

52
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,760
are you going back to training?

53
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,360
Of course,

54
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,800
but you don't need to wait for me.

55
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,030
You can go first after you freshen up.

56
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,360
I can clean this up by myself.

57
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,170
I'll go there when I'm done.

58
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,570
Really?

59
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
That's great.

60
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,080
Do your best.

61
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,920
Good luck.

62
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,170
I'll freshen up.

63
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:34,890
Coach.

64
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,570
Can I return to the team for training?

65
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,640
Are you feeling better?

66
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,320
Don't worry.

67
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,890
Go to the ice rink.

68
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,200
Show me what you've got.

69
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,730
Coach, I don't want
to cooperate with Lin Ge.

70
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,360
Why?

71
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,960
Lin Ge told me to try to be independent,

72
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,760
and I want to know if I can do it alone.

73
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:57,730
What else?

74
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,050
I don't think it's fair for Lin Ge.

75
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,730
Since we joined the team,

76
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:05,330
Lin Ge has been covering for me
in every competition.

77
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:07,410
I think we should have a fair play.

78
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,680
Here are two hypotheses.

79
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:12,850
First,

80
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,610
you're strong enough to win

81
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:16,920
without any tactical cooperation.

82
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:18,370
Second,

83
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,610
Lin Ge surpasses you,

84
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:22,770
and I'll let you cover for her.

85
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,410
Unless either of them happens,

86
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,240
you can't fight alone,

87
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,640
understand?

88
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:31,690
Yes.

89
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,970
Besides, I heard you didn't answer

90
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:37,020
your parents' calls.

91
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:39,000
Now that you're fine,

92
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
remember to call them back.

93
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:50,820
(Mom)

94
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:57,480
Wei, you're back in training.

95
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,170
I'm so happy.

96
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:02,690
Don't worry.

97
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:03,800

98
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:05,290

99

I'll always love you.

100
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,960
I can do it.

101
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,360
We're almost there.

102
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,320
Let me help you.

103
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,880
You might stumble.

104

Nie Chi, the favorite to win the race,

111
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:55,240
accidentally fell in the sprint.

112
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:57,850
Fans from all over the world are worried

113
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,210
about him right now.

114
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,250

116
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:09,280
Coach, Nie Chi is injured.

117
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,360
- I'll...
- Come back.

118
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:13,000
Are you a doctor?

119
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,650
Can you treat him?

120
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,560
What are you here for?

Our doctor is there.

124
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,440
We called his parents.

125
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:29,000
Nie Chi will be fine.

126
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,360
I will do my best.

Lin Ge.

131
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,800
Well, Nie Chi went back to Beijing.

132
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,160
Beijing?

133
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,440
His mother contacted a hospital there.

134
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,650
They took him back.

135
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,930
Where's the injury?

136
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,050
I think it's his meniscus.

137
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,770
Meniscus?

138
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,410
How could it be the meniscus?

139
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:10,120
But I don't know the details.

140
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,290
Don't overthink it.

141
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:16,970
(Yes, he should go back to Beijing.)

142
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,770
(There are good hospitals.)

143
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:20,320
(They can heal him.)

144
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:28,180
(Nie Chi, are you at the airport?)

145
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,360
Have you got on the plane?

146
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,920
When will you arrive?

147
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,050
Does it hurt?

(Li Haifeng)
Listen,

149
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,770
I'm more worried about him than you do.

150
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,320
Wait for the diagnosis.

151
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,440
Okay. In addition,

152
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,200
no matter how late,

153
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,840
call me when you see the results.

154
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,280
Understand?

155
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,130
Okay.

156
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,530
Hello, Ms. Han.

157
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,440
It's about Nie Chi, right?

158
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,370
Li Haifeng told me.

159
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,410
I know you're scared.

160
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,060
But we don't know the results.

161

Don't scare yourself, okay?

162
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,960
A meniscus injury
might not be that serious.

163
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,600
Nie Chi is still young.

164
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,490
He'll probably fully recover.

165
00:09:03,530 --> 00:09:06,130
I got it. Thanks, Ms. Han.

166
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,560
Don't overthink it.

167
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,250
Go to sleep.

168
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,960
A meniscus injury
might not be that serious.

169
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,530
You're young.

170
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,410
You will definitely recover.

171
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,050
You all gave me a high five
before entering the rink.

172
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,800
If I'd insisted on giving him

173
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,130
a high five,

174
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,770
maybe he wouldn't have been injured.

175
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,250
I'm so confused.

176
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,080
Are you saying

177
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,170
you're a lucky star

178
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,720
or a hoodoo?

179
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,320
I don't understand.

180
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,800
I sent him many messages yesterday,

181
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,720
but he didn't reply.

182
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:56,600
He was having a surgery,

183
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,050
and he needed to be anesthetized.

184
00:09:58,370 --> 00:09:59,250
He wasn't sober.

185
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,170
So many examinations.

186
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,560
How could he have time?

187
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,560
Why are you smiling?

188
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,130
Here you are.

189
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,290
I had a surgery last night.

190
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:30,560
Just got my phone.

191
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,200
I'm fine. Don't worry.

192
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,040
Hug hug.

193
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,800
You're so cheesy.

194
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:38,490
Now you're

195
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,410
reassured, right?

196
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:43,050
He's the cure.

197
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,080
Bro, I can't believe it.

198
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,680
Why didn't you reply to me?

199
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,840
You only told her.

200
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,440
You traitor.

201
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,340
Kiss kiss.

202
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:02,890
Is this okay?

203
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:12,970
Kai.

204
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,090
Auntie.

205
00:11:18,290 --> 00:11:19,440
I'll get some hot water, Kai.

206
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,960
Sweetheart, talk to him.

207
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,280
Okay.

208
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:37,200
Sweetheart,
you didn't expect to see me, right?

209
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,080
What's wrong?

210
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:41,370
Did I upset you?

211
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,890
The longer you stay here,

212
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,800
the more upset you'll be.

213
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,080
You'll not only see me

214
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,960
but watch me win Olympic gold medals

215
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,410
and world champions.

216
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,280
Do you want it?

217
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:58,720
What do you want?

218
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,250
I want to know if you'll never

219
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,170
come back.

220
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,370
I want to know

221
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,320
if I'll lose an opponent.

222
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:10,170
You just admitted we're opponents.

223
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,250
It doesn't matter.

224
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,560
You're too weak

225
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,920
to compete with me now.

226
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,200
It's okay to admit it.

227
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,440
Take it as a comfort.

228
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,560
I don't need your comfort.

229
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:23,890
As a senior who got injured before,

230
00:12:24,130 --> 00:12:25,370
I have some advice for you.

231
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,920
Stop making that poker face.

232
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,800
Be happy and positive,

233
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,600
and you'll recover soon.

234
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,080
You're acting like you were positive

235
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,370
when you had a fracture.

236
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:37,520
You...

237
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,770
Good one.

238
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:47,800
As your opponent,

239
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,290
I don't like you.

240
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:51,200
However, as your leader and teammate,

241
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,040
I need you back.

242
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,530
I seldom consider someone
as my opponent.

243
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,800
Keep my words in mind.

244
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,520
Goodbye.

245
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,680
By the way,

246
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:11,320
meniscus takes time to heal.

247
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,050
Just a small heads-up,

248
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,920
don't watch races,

249
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:16,370
especially mine.

250
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,130
I'm afraid my perfect performances

251
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,890
will make you break down.

252
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,370
You should be afraid

253
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,370
that I might make you break down

254
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,920
when I return to the team.

255
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:30,840
I hope your ability

256
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:33,250
will be as tough as your mouth.

257
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,610
Bye.

258
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,890
Did Kai enter the elevator?

259
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,280
I didn't see him.

260
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:15,410
Was the person I saw in the hallway

261
00:14:15,410 --> 00:14:16,530
Gao Kai?

262
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,250
I didn't see him.

263
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,170
But he said he had no time

264
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,250
to visit Nie Chi.

265
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,330
It was him.

266
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,330
He came?

267
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,650
He can come.

268
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:27,170
Why did he have to

269
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,080
visit you secretly?

270
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,320
Maybe he didn't want others to find out

271
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,530
he came here to see me.

272
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:34,960
Aren't you ashamed of saying this?

273
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:38,440
Okay. I think you're fine.

274
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:40,170
This room

275
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:43,050
looks very nice.

276
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,920
And Kai also came to visit you.

277
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:47,770
Maybe I should take the fruits back.

278
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,560
Watch your language.

279
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,250
Hey,

280
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:58,920
take it easy.

281
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,320
Rest well.

282
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,410
We're all waiting for you.

283
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,130
No. I can't do this.

284
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,800
This is disgusting.

285
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,890
You tell him.

286
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,490
Does it hurt?

287
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,920
Without the anesthesia,

288
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,560
it hurts a little.

289
00:15:46,010 --> 00:15:47,440
Hey, it's okay.

290
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,730
Don't be sad.

291
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,760
Come on.

292
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,490
I've been thinking

293
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,440
a lot these days.

294
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,370
I even blamed myself

295
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:06,080
for not sharing my luck with you

296
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,370
before the competition.

297
00:16:10,150 --> 00:16:10,990
Well,

298
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,840
let me share your luck now,

299
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:14,370
and I'll recover soon.

300
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:22,210
By the way,

301
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:23,960
I'll visit you every weekend.

302
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,530
You're busy with competitions.

303
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:31,600
Mr. Li won't let you go

304
00:16:32,010 --> 00:16:33,490
without a good reason.

305
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,130
Isn't visiting you a good reason?

306
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,770
It doesn't work for Mr. Li.

307
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,020
We can talk on the phone,

308
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,080
FaceTime, or send messages.

309
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,320
It won't be long.

310
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,200
When this season is over,

311
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:54,760
when you recover,

312
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,890
we'll visit Master and Mrs. Fang.

313
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:01,440
Okay, we'll visit them together.

314
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,160
Come on.

315
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,060
(National Ice Sports Base)

316
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,840
The doctor didn't say

317
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,080
when he'd recover.

318
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,530
I don't know what I can do.

319
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:26,880
Zhu Zhu knows a lot about knee injuries.

320
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,160
You can ask her.

321
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,330
Don't worry.

322
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,920
Zhu Zhu.

323
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,370
Are you reading?

324
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:44,890
Zhu Zhu.

325
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,970
Can I talk to you?

326
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,690
Well, you know a lot
about knee injuries.

327
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,730
Maybe you know how to help him.

328
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,970
My injury is different.

329
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,360
The doctor has said

330
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,210
it's possible for him to

331
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,250
restore his ability.

332
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,640
Be patient.

333
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,080
Zhu Zhu, is there any other way?

334
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,050
If I had another way,

335
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,800
I would've joined the national team
a long time ago.

336
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,660
Well, I fell on my buttocks.

337
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:42,080
In the ice rink,

338
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,450
it's just a moment.

339
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:46,800
A moment,

340
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:49,290
and maybe he can't skate again.

341
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,210
I don't have any other advice.

342
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,290
It occurs to me

343
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,370
that we should

344
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,560
treat each competition

345
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,810
as the last competition.

346
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,840
A moment...

347
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:37,340
Can you stand without crutches?

348
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:39,530
My healthy leg is fine,

349
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:42,050
but the other one can't stand at all.

350
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:46,770
Does your knee hurt when you're resting?

351
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,370
It does,

352
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,290
but I can bear it.

353
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,000
Mrs. Nie, come with me.

354
00:19:52,530 --> 00:19:55,320
Doctor, I want to hear it.

355
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:56,770
I'm an athlete.

356
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,970
I need to know my rehabilitation plan.

357
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:02,840
Let's talk here.

358
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,600
The Lysholm Knee Scoring Scale

359
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,320
can evaluate your knee functions,

360
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,050
but the results are not good.

361
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,320
I tried to move your joint,

362
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,690
but the popping noises

363
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,530
and activity limitations were clear.

364
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,290
So, you must be patient

365
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:18,400
about rehabilitation.

366
00:20:18,930 --> 00:20:20,530
Right now, we should focus on

367
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,560
how to relieve your pain

368
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,120
and restore joint activity

369
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:25,250
to prevent joint adhesion
and muscle wasting.

370
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,930
Can I do weight training?

371
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:29,690
Basic rehabilitation first.

372
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:31,690
If it goes well,

373
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,450
we'll consider weight training.

374
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,840
We'll follow your directions.

375
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,730
I have a pre-surgery consultation.

376
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,010
I'll leave you alone.

377
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,320
Call me if you need me.

378
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:40,290
Okay, thank you.

379
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:49,050
Be careful! Don't rush!

380
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:50,640
You just had a surgery a week ago.

381
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,370
Mom.

382
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,050
Did the surgery work?

383
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,920
Of course.

384
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:00,160
Your dad showed the X-ray

385
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,840
to many hospitals,

386
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:02,970
and they said you'd be fine.

387
00:21:05,450 --> 00:21:07,560
Then why am I still in a poor condition?

388
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:23,140
(TPO iBT, Reading)
Here.

389
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:24,720
What?

390
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,080
Don't be angry.

391
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,970
We can't kidnap you abroad.

392
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,500
Given your situation,

393
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,560
we need a plan B, right?

394
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,530
After all, you're in the hospital.

395
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,560
Reading the materials
isn't a waste of time.

396
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:43,730
Plan B...

397
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,380
Can I visit you

398
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,050
(Nie Chi)
on my day off?

399
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,840
I have many examinations to do.

400
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:08,010
I won't have much time to see you.

401
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:10,290
Aren't you going to Montreal soon?

402
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:11,730
You should rest well.

403
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,130
Lin Ge.

404
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,280
You haven't seen him

405
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,800
since that day?

406
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,160
No. I'm a little worried.

407
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,050
We're going to Montreal in two days.

408
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:36,250
What are you going to do?

409
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:39,480
Focus on the race.

410
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,400
I'll visit him when I come back.

411
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:43,960
Okay.

412
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:26,440
Put your leg down.

413
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:28,460
Who told you to use a sandbag?

414
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,120
What's wrong with it? Is it stuck?

415
00:23:48,290 --> 00:23:49,730
This is a trick knee,

416
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,600
which means your meniscus

417
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:52,970
is far from fully recovered.

418
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:57,680
Feeling better now?

419
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,800
Much better. Thanks.

420
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:04,290
Sorry for the trouble.

421
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:06,560
It's not a big deal.

422
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,490
Your health is the priority.

423
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:09,600
To recover,

424
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:11,210
you can't only count on us.

425
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,120
You need to be cooperative.

426
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,050
Tell me,

427
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,880
why are you so impatient?

428
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:18,380
Mr. Li said

429
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:20,530
your next season would be
the next winter.

430
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:24,450
I'm worried about
the detraining syndrome.

431
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,870
I can feel

432
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,320
the muscle loss,

433
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,120
and my heartbeat is often irregular.

434
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,400
I don't know if a person's senses

435
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,290
can be this sharp,

436
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:36,050
but I can tell you're anxious.

437
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:41,640
I just want to restore
my instinctive reactions.

438
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,490
If I lose my sensitivity,

439
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:49,600
I'll have to say goodbye
to the ice rink.

440
00:24:52,690 --> 00:24:53,530
If that's the case,

441
00:24:53,650 --> 00:24:55,420
I'll arrange
some weighing training for you,

442
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,080
but don't do this alone.

443
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,680
Okay.

444
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,290
However,

445
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:02,800
at this stage,

446
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,450
it might be bad for your recovery.

447
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:06,770
If you feel uncomfortable,

448
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,760
stop immediately.

449
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:09,570
I got it.

450
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,720
Thanks, doctor.

451
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:14,960
Rest well.

452
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,380
(Lin Ge)

453
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,770
We arrived in Montreal and checked in.

454
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,880
Wei and I are going to the canteen.

455
00:25:54,690 --> 00:25:56,360
I'll finish dinner when you wake up.

456
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,530
If you don't have
rehabilitation treatments,

457
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:00,290
can we chat?

458
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,800
Of course.

459
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,820
(Add Alarm)

460
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,420
(In 3 hours and 55 minutes)

461
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,120
Time's up. Raise your leg.

462
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,690
Okay. Hold for five seconds.

463
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,720
Okay. Put it down.

464
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,220
Slowly.

465
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:37,380
Try to stretch your joints.

466
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:39,490
Let's see how far you can go.

467
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,640
Feel your body.

468
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,770
Don't push yourself.

469
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:48,320
Come on. Up, up.

470
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,880
Up, up.

471
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:55,850
Reached the limit?

472
00:26:57,730 --> 00:26:58,570
Put it down.

473
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:00,640
Come on.

474
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,720
Ice bag, please.

475
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:04,610
Okay.

476
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,360
Slow down.

477
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,490
Why is my balance getting worse?

478
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,320
What did you say?

479
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,160
Doctor, if my recovery
is not going well,

480
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:19,250
what's the worst-case scenario?

481
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,970
Your surgery was successful.

482
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,900
If you stick to the plan,

483
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,730
you'll go back to the normal state.

484
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,080
Normal state?

485
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:30,640
Do you mean

486
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,360
I can't do overloaded training

487
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,720
like other athletes anymore?

488
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,640
Focus on the treatment first.

489
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,240
Normal?

490
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,010
But it's the worst result for me.

491
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:11,320
The doctor told me

492
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:12,800
it wasn't serious.

493
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,400
Don't worry.

494
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,120
Do you really believe him?

495
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,600
Chi couldn't sleep at night.

496
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,600
I couldn't persuade him.

497
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:23,880
Look at you.

498
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,530
Do you think I can?

499
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,880
Has he ever listened to us?

500
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:34,810
Enough.

501
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,490
I've made up my mind.

502
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:38,930
No matter what,

503
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,490
we need to send him abroad.

504
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,210
Otherwise, he'll think about

505
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,880
skating all the time.

506
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:46,930
He's grown up.

507
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,600
What if he doesn't want to?

508
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:50,290
If he could figure it out,

509
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,320
why would we worry about him?

510
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,470
Anyway,

511
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,640
I have to send him abroad,
whatever it takes.

512
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,750
Are you surprised?

513
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:09,620
(TOFEL Basics, Writing)

514
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,120
What are you reading?

515
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,080
TOFEL?

516
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,760
Did you ask me to come tomorrow

517
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,030
because you wanted to read this?

518
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:24,730
I was so bored,

519
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:27,210
so I opened it.

520
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,800
Bored?

521
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,240
Why didn't you read other books

522
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,220
or do other things?

523
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,490
Why are you studying TOEFL?

524
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,050
You decided to go abroad, right?

525
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,800
Are you giving up skating?

526
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,840
Are you breaking up with me?

527
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,690
No. Of course not.

528
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:46,970
I had a meniscus tear.

529
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,590
My postoperative evaluation
didn't go well.

530
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:52,320
The doctor wouldn't allow me
to do weighing training.

531
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,930
I don't know if I can fully recover.

532
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,530
I don't know whether or when I can

533
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,370
restore my balance

534
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,360
and explosive power.

535
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,850
I don't know anything.

536
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,770
Why didn't you tell me?

537
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:14,730
I didn't want to affect your race.

538
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,880
You wouldn't tell me anything,

539
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:18,530
and that's what really affected me.

540
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,770
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

541
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,360
I had such a hard time, and I didn't

542
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,080
want you to see it.

543
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,730
Besides, I don't know

544
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:31,160
if I can fully recover.

545
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,050
I don't want to let you down.

546
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,050
Since we met,

547
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,210
you've always been there

548
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:40,250
when I had hard times.

549
00:30:40,770 --> 00:30:42,080
Have I ever hidden it from you?

550
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,730
Have I ever treated you
like an outsider?

551
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,800
How about you?

552
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:48,730
I've never treated you
like an outsider either.

553
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,010
However, when I'm lying in bed,

554
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,290
I'm always thinking a lot.

555
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,370
It's getting worse.

556
00:30:57,930 --> 00:30:59,400
Besides, my parents are anxious too.

557
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:02,080
I'm reading this

558
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,160
because I want to have a plan B

559
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:06,120
and reassure them.

560
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,010
But I think

561
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,560
a plan B will only make you

562
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:14,400
give up skating.

563
00:31:15,670 --> 00:31:16,520
Silly girl.

564
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,770
Why are you laughing?

565
00:31:18,250 --> 00:31:19,450
You told me

566
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,930
we'd join the national team,

567
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,320
win gold medals,

568
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,080
and become better people together.

569
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:25,320
You can't back out.

570
00:31:28,930 --> 00:31:29,970
I won't back out.

571
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,080
Do you remember this?

572
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:50,160
You gave it to me,

573
00:31:50,930 --> 00:31:52,930
and it has brought me good fortune.

574
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:54,690
So, I'm giving it to you.

575
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,450
I believe you'll definitely recover.

576
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,160
Please believe it like I do.

577
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:07,320
Give it a shot for us, okay?

578
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,800
Okay. I promise.

579
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:22,750
I'll get some food for you.

580
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:32,260
(VIP Room I)

581
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:33,130
Auntie.

582
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,360
Are you Nie Chi's girlfriend?

583
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,120
Oh, Auntie.

584
00:32:47,210 --> 00:32:48,050
I...

585
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,800
Yes.

586
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,490
It's normal,

587
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,810
and it's not a bad thing.

588
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,120
Actually, I need your help.

589
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,210
Can you help me

590
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,250
to persuade Nie Chi?

591
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:05,880
Do you want me to persuade him
to go abroad?

592
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,360
I can send both of you abroad

593
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,050
if you like.

594
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:11,490
Does he have to go abroad?

595
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,640
As an athlete,

596
00:33:14,730 --> 00:33:16,050
he's not young.

597
00:33:16,450 --> 00:33:17,970
If he studies abroad and gets a degree,

598
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:19,970
he'll take over our business
when he's back.

599
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,730
But from what I know about him,

600
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,160
he wants to be a world champion

601
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,530
rather than doing business.

602
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:32,210
Do you think he has a choice?

603
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:35,530
Then did you ask him what he wants?

604
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,320
No matter what he wants,

605
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:38,530
going abroad

606
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:40,530
is the best option
we can offer him right now.

607
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,450
Besides, he promised us
to get good results

608
00:33:42,450 --> 00:33:43,600
without getting hurt,

609
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,120
so we didn't stop him.

610
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:47,250
However, he's lying in bed
and can't move.

611
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,490
How can you tell me
to ask him what he wants?

612
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:51,210
As his parents,

613
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:53,600
how can we not know what he likes?

614
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,290
But he's lying in bed.
Does he have a choice?

615
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,720
- Auntie, but I think...
- Sorry,

616
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,050
I have to go.

617
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:05,120
Thank you for visiting him.

618
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:13,410
(I've finally managed to find a balance
between reason)

619
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:14,490
(and emotion.)

620
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,240
(However, Nie Chi's injury)

621
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:17,970
(and his family's obstruction)

622
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,330
(suddenly took my throat like a rope.)

623
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,600
(I feel out of breath.)

624
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:27,720
(If Nie Chi can't keep me company
on the way to our dreams,)

625
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,670
The finish line!

626
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,840
- (will I have the courage to carry on?)
- Sprint!
