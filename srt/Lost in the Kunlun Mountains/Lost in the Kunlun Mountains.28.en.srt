[Episode 28]

4
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,580
It's time.

5
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,970
Help me put on the Phoenix Coronet.

6
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,370
Send me to get married.

7
00:02:04,190 --> 00:02:05,750
Then our previous debts

8
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:08,729
are all settled.

9
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:11,880
Okay?

10
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,710
Are you engaged to someone else?

11
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,390
I...

12
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,900
If not, can I...

13
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:37,410
Can I marry you?

14
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,670
Call me your wife again and I'll slap you in the face.

15
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,390
Dear wife.

16
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,070
Dear wife.

17
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:12,990
I swear...

18
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,340
I,

19
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:17,440
Luo Jiutian, I swear...

20
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,850
I'll treat you well wholeheartedly.

21
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,040
I'll be good to you forever.

22
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,560
I think, firstly,

23
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:44,490
stay alive.

24
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:45,790
Secondly,

25
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:48,180
what if I really marry Wu Shuang?

26
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:49,570
Thirdly,

27
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:52,280
what if I stay alive and also marry Wu Shuang?

28
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,750
Because I

29
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,610
like you.

30
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,110
I'm unfilial.

31
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:49,960
Goodbye, master.

32
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,800
Our master asked me to deliver a message.

33
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,620
He asked me to apologize to you for him.

34
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,280
When you were trapped in the underground palace,

35
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,260
it's not that he didn't want to save you,

36
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,270
but for the sake of the Mound-digging Sect.

37
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,870
He hopes you won't blame him.

38
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,260
Besides,

39
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,520
The life in the Mound-digging Region is bitter.

40
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,360
In the future,

41
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,460
if you have a child,

42
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,909
just send him down here.

43
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:34,610
Our master and the Mound-digging Sect

44
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,210
will take care of your child.

45
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,180
Alright.

46
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,330
I've finished delivering our master's message.

47
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:43,380
Wu Shuang,

48
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,740
congratulations.

49
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:54,370
It's time for our master to take the medicine for the second time.

50
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,900
I have to go back.

51
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,400
Don't cry, Wu Shuang.

52
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:38,490
If your makeup is messed up from the crying,

53
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:40,490
you won't be able to marry the groom.

Be happy.

00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,669

Wu Shuang.

89
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:02,860
Why are you...

90
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,810
I'm here to marry you.

91
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:46,170
You look so beautiful today.

92
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:51,030
But you shouldn't be here.

93
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,940
Why not?

94
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:57,690
Just because there are few people here?

95
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,230
Yunqi.

96
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:01,330
Without you,

97
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,130
no matter how many people there are around me,

98
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,530
I will still feel lonely.

99
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,280
That's why I'm here.

100
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,810
I'm going to live happily with you.

101
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,420
No matter how bitter the life is,

102
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,820
I still think it's sweet.

103
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,320
Besides,

104
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,800
I'm the most favored junior disciple in the Mound-digging Sect.

105
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,980
All my seniors

106
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,110
won't let us suffer.

107
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:24,300
But...

108
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,390
If you say a sentence,

109
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,790
I'll just give you a kiss.

110
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,990
There's no one else here anyway.

111
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,090
I won't be shy.

112
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,540
You smiled.

113
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,580
You won't drive me away again, will you?

114
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,380
No.

115
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:53,150
We'll have a chance to leave here anyway.

116
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,620
Yunqi.

117
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,920
Let's finish the wedding ceremony and get married.

118
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,080
What should I say?

119
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:34,270
I don't know, either.

120
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:38,640
I think of a poem.

121
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,150
We became husband and wife,

122
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,320
and love each other forever.

123
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,580
Tonight is the happy time for us.

124
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,560
We should take the time to fully enjoy ourselves.

125
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,760
Then what?

126
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,200
The several lines following that

127
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,040
are ominous

128
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,510
and inappropriate.

129
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,610
But I want to tell you the last line.

130
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,230
If I survive, I'll return home,

131
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:13,420
but if I die, you can also remember me forever.

132
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,410
If I survive, I'll return home,

133
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,520
but if I die, you can also remember me forever.

134
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,240
I like this line.

135
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,720
Sorry.

136
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,640
Dear,

137
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,980
I can't give you anything now.

138
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,390
It's good enough.

139
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,500
Yunqi,

140
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:37,670
let's kowtow to God for three times.

141
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,660
Let him be our witness.

142
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,300
From now on,

143
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:42,520
both of us

144
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:44,200
are one life.

145
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,060
Okay.

146
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,270
Good.

147
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,830
It's great to finish the wedding ceremony and get married.

148
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:34,800
Come on.

149
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,020
Since you're here,

150
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,830
why don't you meet us in person?

151
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,430
What's there to see me?

152
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,450
Pay more attention to your beautiful wife.

153
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,210
I've been lonely all my life.

154
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:51,900
I like loving couples the best.

155
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,380
It's great to see a young couple

156
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,780
in such a desolate place.

157
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,650
Yunqi.

158
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,960
Who is this person?

159
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,350
I don't know.

160
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,790
That's the general situation.

161
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,080
We're divided into three teams to go on patrol in turns.

162
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,020
There are no invisible sentry

163
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,680
of the Mound-digging Sect near your residence.

164
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:20,840
It can't be.

165
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,980
Although Zhou Qiuhai

166
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,030
got injured,

167
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,160
after such a long time,

168
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,840
he should be recovered.

169
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Why is his condition getting worse?

170
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,040
According to our investigation,

171
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:33,900
the Mound-digging Sect has been consulting the doctor.

172
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:36,210
The medicine he uses is getting more and more expensive.

173
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,640
Recently, they've even hired several

174
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,230
doctors from other counties.

175
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:40,450
In that case,

176
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:42,240
many things can be explained.

177
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:44,020
According to the prescription on it

178
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:47,170
and the doctor's diagnosis,

179
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,820
Zhou Qiuhai should know he's dying.

180
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,330
That's why he sent Yunqi

181
00:16:51,330 --> 00:16:52,380
to the Mound-digging Region

182
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,650
so as to remove his own worry.

183
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,880
I think it's a good thing.

184
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,440
It's much easier to

185
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:02,160
control a sick leader

186
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,930
than a young and powerful leader.

187
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,569
When a person is mentally weak,

188
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:07,300
his health will also get worse.

189
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,930
One more thing.

190
00:17:09,930 --> 00:17:11,780
When we catch Zhou Qiuhai,

191
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,589
what if we use too much force

192
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:15,250
and make his condition worse?

193
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,200
If something wrong happens

194
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,670
to Zhou Qiuhai in our place,

195
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,690
the Gold Touching Sect and the Mound-digging Sect

196
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:22,290
will really become enemies.

197
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,720
What are you afraid of?

198
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,270
Someone died before.

199
00:17:26,619 --> 00:17:27,130
Even if one more man dies...

200
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:27,730
Fengling.

201
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,510
I told you

202
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Auntie Hei's death was an accident.

203
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:34,630
Except for saving Yunqi,

204
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,030
we have no other goal now.

205
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:43,330
According to the current situation,

206
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,880
the Mound-digging Sect's defense is not very tight.

207
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,560
Sanxuan,

208
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,740
bring the buddies of the Gold Touching Sect

209
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,460
[Headquarters of the Mound-digging Sect]

210
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,550
to launch a fake attack at the gate by then.

211
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:52,080
The more chaos, the better.

212
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:54,830
The Black Feather Team will follow me.

213
00:17:54,830 --> 00:17:56,300
Climb over the wall to get in from this side.

214
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:57,640
If you meet people from the Mound-digging Sect,

215
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,320
don't keep fighting with them.

216
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,660
We only have one target.

217
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:00,580
Zhou Qiuhai.

218
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:01,470
Besides,

219
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,860
don't shoot anyone

220
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,280
unless it's necessary.

221
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,080
-Yes. -Yes.

222
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,300
Get ready.

223
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,010
Okay.

224
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,460
Chief.

225
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:12,890
What's wrong?

226
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:15,580
Too tranquil.

227
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,320
It shouldn't be this tranquil.

228
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:34,440
Yunqi.

229
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,150
Come and see

230
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,950
whether it's too high or too low.

231
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,410
As long as it's made by you,

232
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:43,540
it looks good no matter what it's like.

233
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:45,560
Dear.

234
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:47,240
Come on.

235
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,280
I'm not that delicate.

236
00:18:56,570 --> 00:18:58,100
I'm just worried about you.

237
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,640
I can only get married with you here.

238
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,900
Sorry to let you feel wronged.

239
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,100
I don't feel wronged.

240
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:05,130
As long as I can be with you,

241
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,400
I don't care

242
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,740
where we are.

243
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:11,770
I'll get some wood

244
00:19:12,230 --> 00:19:13,890
and make you a dressing table.

245
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:15,550
Then I can help to draw your eyebrows every day.

246
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,350
No need.

247
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,660
Look. My eyebrows are dark and thick.

248
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,010
You don't understand.

249
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,690
Drawing your eyebrows

250
00:19:23,150 --> 00:19:24,610
means the joy of a bedroom.

251
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,010
What is the joy of bedroom?

252
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:32,360
I'll tell you after we drink it.

253
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,280
Why are you so slow?

254
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,620
What's there to see?

255
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:02,930
I've seen it before.

256
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:03,890
I'm an old woman,

257
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:05,700
and I don't have much time to live.

258
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,250
If you are that slow,

259
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,390
when can you

260
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:10,490
give birth to a baby for me to have fun with?

261
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,540
If you don't show up,

262
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,800
why should we give birth to a baby for you?

263
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,900
You are an interesting girl.

264
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,600
You're totally shameless.

265
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:19,350
Good. I like it.

266
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,750
I'll catch you sooner or later.

267
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,630
You also have a fiery disposition.

268
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,020
I didn't expect Zhou Qiuhai

269
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,780
to have a disciple like you.

270
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,460
Forget it. I'm leaving.

271
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,220
Go and have a baby.

272
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,030
Wu Shuang.

273
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:39,090
Do you want to know who this person is?

274
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,680
Yes, I do.

275
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,350
But how can we see her?

276
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:48,930
Ma'am, we mean no harm.

277
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,300
Are you okay, Ma'am?

278
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:37,190
Ma'am.

279
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:38,540
Don't be afraid.

280
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,930
We won't hurt you.

281
00:22:43,490 --> 00:22:44,290
Ma'am.

282
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,740
I'm a western doctor.

283
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:46,930
I'm a doctor.

284
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:49,250
Let me give you an examination.

285
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,780
Did I hurt you badly?

286
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,880
I already withdrew my force.

287
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,390
It should be an old injury.

288
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,160
It has nothing to do with you.

289
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,340
Ma'am.

290
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,640
We have no ill intentions.

291
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,770
Nor will we hurt you.

292
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,420
It's hard to say.

293
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:09,230
It's been 20 years.

294
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:12,420
The old bastard down the mountain

295
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,990
has come up with many ways to trick me.

296
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:18,890
Maybe

297
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,710
you two

298
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:25,280
are his new tricks.

299
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,130
Bastard?

300
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,850
Tricks?

301
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,420
Ma'am, you misunderstood.

302
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,840
We thought

303
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,900
there were only the two of us in the Mound-digging Region.

304
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,410
I didn't expect there was someone else.

305
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:39,300
I just wanted to come and find out the truth.

306
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:40,270
That's great.

307
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,740
I have one more person to chat with in the future.

308
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:42,660
Am I right?

309
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,680
Who wants to chat with you?

310
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,040
Ma'am,

311
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:50,140
to be honest,

312
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:52,650
I've been an orphan since I was a child.

313
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,320
Yunqi's parents have passed away, too.

314
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:56,940
We don't know

315
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:59,870
how long we have to stay in the Mound-digging Region.

316
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,100
We can take you

317
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,120
as the elder of our family and look after you.

318
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,650
Please let him check on you.

319
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:07,610
Get out!

320
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,500
Get out!

321
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,730
Get out now!

322
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,840
Ma'am.

323
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:20,250
Ma'am, sorry to bother you.

324
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:22,310
We'll leave at once.

325
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:26,800
Let's go.

326
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:58,970
Yunqi.

327
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,230
Do you think

328
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,060
the old bastard she mentioned

329
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,220
is my master?

330
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,270
Who else can trap a person

331
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,130
in the Mound-digging Region for 20 years except him?

332
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,990
Then why did he have to lock her up?

333
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,390
Did she break into the underground palace, too?

334
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,730
Who is she?

335
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:18,130
I think her martial arts skills

336
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:19,530
are similar to Yanzhi's.

337
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,040
You mean

338
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,600
she's Lao Beifeng?

339
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,680
Cui Yanzhi said

340
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,740
her leader Lao Beifeng

341
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,850
had disappeared for more than 10 years.

342
00:25:35,850 --> 00:25:37,320
No one knows where she is.

343
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,490
But why did my master lock up

344
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,750
the leader of the Mountain-moving Sect?

345
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,990
Even if she is Lao Beifeng,

346
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,830
she must have made a big mistake.

347
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,970
Otherwise, my master wouldn't have locked her up.

348
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:01,890
Do you feel cold?

349
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,360
A little.

350
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,160
Go inside.

351
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:36,690
♫I like to smile at you♫

352
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,210
♫I like to chatter to you♫

♫With all the noise and sound♫

354

♫I plant all kinds of plants together with you♫

♫It's so nice to have you♫

368
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,700
[Weight of the Bullet: 36 kg]

369
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,240
Master.

370
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:45,050
Pour it away.

371
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:47,680
I don't need to feign illness at this time.

372
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:49,170
Yes.

373
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,110
Master.

374
00:28:57,860 --> 00:29:00,130
As you said, Luo Yunsong and Sun Sanxuan

375
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:02,430
are dispatching people to do it.

376
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,250
How is Ding Yunqi?

377
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:07,140
According to the buddies at the watchtower,

378
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,070
that old lunatic

379
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,450
went to see Ding Yunqi.

380
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:10,710
Master.

381
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,810
Is it inappropriate?

382
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,200
It's fine.

383
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,360
That old lunatic will die soon.

384
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,960
But you said she knew...

385
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:26,090
Even if she knows it,

386
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,160
I have a backup plan.

387
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:37,090
Yes.

388
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:37,850
Master.

389
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:44,230
Such being the case, I have no choice.

390
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,170
This old lunatic has been locked up for 20 years.

391
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,710
She hasn't given in for 20 years.

392
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,520
So I can only

393
00:29:54,850 --> 00:29:56,380
turn his trick to my own use.

394
00:29:56,790 --> 00:29:57,580
Ding Yunqi

395
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,810
might be my only chance.

396
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,690
So you put Ding Yunqi in the Mound-digging Region

397
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:06,660
as you want him to

398
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:08,460
get the thing out of the lunatic?

399
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:12,490
I'm so stupid.

400
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,430
If you hadn't explained it,

401
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,810
I wouldn't have

402
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,200
figured it out.

403
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,220
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

404
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,290
I thought

405
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,180
Wu Shuang

406
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:26,900
would definitely break into

407
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:29,080
the underground palace with Ding Yunqi.

408
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,300
But I wasn't sure

409
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:33,030
whether Ding Yunqi would give up

410
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:35,220
the Soul Pursuit Order for Wu Shuang.

411
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,110
Fortunately,

412
00:30:38,530 --> 00:30:41,390
he values the love between them more than I thought.

413
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:44,480
It's because you devised a good strategy.

414
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,010
Yutian.

415
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,900
Among all these disciples,

416
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,450
I trust you the best.

417
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,850
Only you know this.

418
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,540
Handle things well for me.

419
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:58,270
Everything here

420
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:01,020
will be yours in the future.

421
00:31:02,010 --> 00:31:04,110
I won't let you down.

422
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,240
Those buddies who are asleep should wake up soon.

423
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,430
Take the letter written by me

424
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,560
to go there.

425
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,820
Yes, master.

426
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,130
Ask them to stay in the town.

427
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:20,110
Don't attract others' attention.

428
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,400
Don't worry, master.

429
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:22,590
Go.

430
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:23,560
Yes, master.

431
00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:58,050
What are you doing?

432
00:31:58,050 --> 00:31:58,910
Stop shouting.

433
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:00,510
Or I'll kill you.

434
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,640
Hang in there.

435
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,360
We really have no choice.

436
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,660
We'll let you go later.

437
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,590
San Jin, keep an eye on him.

438
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:16,390
Gag him.

439
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,310
Okay.

440
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:23,610
Well, I...

441
00:32:23,610 --> 00:32:24,580
Hang in there.

442
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,150
I'm really sorry.

443
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:39,110
Buddies,

444
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,670
we...

445
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,240
Brother.

446
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,240
No need to say anything.

447
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,300
We know what to do.

448
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:51,950
We're going to save Yunqi this time.

449
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,850
We must succeed.

450
00:32:54,190 --> 00:32:55,150
Failure is not allowed.

451
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:55,990
Yes!

452
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,010
Alright.

453
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,030
Then let's not say anything.

454
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:05,720
Brother.

455
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,460
Chief.

456
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,830
Is everything ready?

457
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,650
Be careful.

458
00:33:10,650 --> 00:33:11,450
Don't worry.

459
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,250
Guys, be careful.

460
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:14,560
Don't worry, chief.

461
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:16,530
Let's go.

462
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:17,460
-Yes. -Go.

463
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:23,210
Chief.

464
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,330
Try not to hurt others.

465
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,290
-Yes. -Yes.

466
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,680
Go and see how it is going with Sanxuan first.

467
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:35,390
Yes.

468
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,290
Don't worry.

469
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,340
Things are going as our chief has planned.

470
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:51,140
We will be fine.

471
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,760
You will be fine, too.

472
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,300
I'm not worried.

473
00:33:58,150 --> 00:33:58,950
That's good.

474
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,380
Have some water

475
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,760
or go to sleep.

476
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:02,990
We'll be back soon.

477
00:34:32,210 --> 00:34:33,010
Guys!

478
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,900
You know Sun Wukong's making a scene in the Heavenly Palace, right?

479
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,699
Yes.

480
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:37,340
Let's make a scene, too.

481
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:38,560
Make the scene as big as you can.

482
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:39,730
Make it a big mess.

483
00:34:39,730 --> 00:34:40,610
-Okay! -Okay!

484
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,370
Our master was right.

485
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,130
You are so bold as to

486
00:34:59,130 --> 00:35:00,660
launch a sneak attack here.

487
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,130
Don't go back since you've come here.

488
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,390
Is this a sneak attack?

489
00:35:05,730 --> 00:35:07,450
I came here

490
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:08,290
quite openly.

491
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,720
Is this a sneak attack?

492
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,390
What?

493
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,400
Loser.

494
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,650
Have you recovered?

495
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,420
You can't decide

496
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,890
where I should go, can you?

497
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,750
How stubborn you are!

498
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,080
Can you really hit me?

499
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,470
Let's go.

500
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:10,830
Come on.

501
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,710
Let me see.

502
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:15,820
How is it?

503
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,130
Sanxuan has started fighting with the Mound-digging Sect.

504
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,950
The entire headquarters of the Mound-digging Sect is in chaos.

505
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:21,750
Good.

506
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,440
Chief.

507
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:26,910
What happened?

508
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:29,170
How come there's still no movement here?

509
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,450
Sanxuan has just started the action.

510
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:33,180
The good show hasn't begun yet.

511
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:34,090
Just wait.

512
00:36:34,430 --> 00:36:35,310
Yes.

513
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:39,760
Let's go.

514
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:43,920
Chief.

515
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,770
They're coming, aren't they?

516
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:12,440
Miss Chu,

517
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,570
don't be afraid.

518
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,380
I'm here. No one dares to hurt you.

519
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,310
Don't be afraid. I'll protect you.

520
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,370
Hold it tight.

521
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,940
Don't hurt your own feet.

522
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,710
Sanxuan said

523
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:28,260
this is the excitement before the war.

524
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:33,440
Have I brought shame on my young master?

525
00:37:35,450 --> 00:37:36,290
No.

526
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,750
We agreed to pretend to be martial artists.

527
00:37:40,750 --> 00:37:42,850
Why do you pretend to be a knight?

528
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,530
What knight?

529
00:37:48,430 --> 00:37:50,090
A brave hero who fights alone.

530
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:52,690
Be brave and fight alone?

531
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:54,860
No, we have so many people here.

532
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,580
We are not alone.

533
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,350
I can't explain it to you.

534
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,940
I've overestimated Luo Yunsong.

535
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:20,950
Didn't he send some men to protect the Soul Pursuit Order?

536
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,120
For a good chance like this,

537
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,100
if I can't seize it,

538
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:27,990
I would feel sorry to have wasted his kindness.

539
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,170
Miss Chu,

540
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,210
I don't want to hurt you.

541
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,210
Give me the Soul Pursuit Order.

542
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:35,260
Are you Tian Long?

543
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,740
You know quite a lot.

544
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,710
Let her go.

545
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,150
Brother.

546
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,260
Don't you understand what I said?

547
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,560
Let go of my sister!

548
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:48,610
Luo Jiutian,

549
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:49,960
aren't you dead?

550
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:51,290
Where did you come from?

551
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,440
Tian Long, you know me?

552
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,790
It proves that I'm quite famous.

553
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,120
Do you know what I can do?

554
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:57,350
Let her go now,

555
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,680
or I'll kill you at once.

556
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,060
Don't use a woman as a shield.

557
00:39:03,610 --> 00:39:04,660
How about this? I...

558
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:05,460
I'll spare your life.

559
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,920
Let her go. I'll let you go.

560
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:09,110
You? You are not able to kill me.

561
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:22,590
Let me tell you. He has launched the signal flare.

562
00:39:22,590 --> 00:39:23,810
If you don't let her go now,

563
00:39:23,810 --> 00:39:25,320
Luo Yunsong will be here soon with the Black Feather Team,

564
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:27,420
and by then, you can't leave even if you want to.

565
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,890
If only they could come.

566
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,710
Sun Sanxuan is trapped at the headquarters of the Mound-digging Sect.

567
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,570
Luo Yunsong is busy enough with his own affairs now.

568
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:42,370
Are you okay?

569
00:39:57,870 --> 00:39:58,960
Is my hair ugly?

570
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,780
How come it's you?

571
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:15,640
You're Tian Long?

572
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,550
Tian Long won't let you off.

573
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:22,570
Just wait to die.

574
00:40:40,250 --> 00:40:41,170
He's dead.

575
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:45,210
He's not dead.

576
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,430
He's captured by us.

577
00:40:53,140 --> 00:40:54,600
He Biao, you're so stupid.

578
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,580
If you say he's not dead,

579
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,310
Tian Long will come to save him.

580
00:40:59,730 --> 00:41:00,490
Got it.

581
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,590
Carry him away.

582
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,260
Yes.

583
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,170
Why are you still that stupid?

584
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,460
What does this mean?

585
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,710
I've just saved Chu Fengling.

586
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,780
Don't you have anything to say, Jiutian?

587
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,340
What should I say?

588
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:47,530
I thought

589
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:49,500
if you see me again,

590
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:51,600
you would dance with joy.

591
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:53,990
What does this mean?

592
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,040
You should at least smile.

593
00:41:58,620 --> 00:41:59,670
Do you want me to die?

594
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,260
Of course not.

595
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,360
So fierce.

596
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,010
Then tell me

597
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,370
why you are still alive,

598
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,560
and why you are here.

599
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,240
Special Commissioner Chu Fengling,

600
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,460
Deputy Special Commissioner Luo Yunsong,

601
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,900
I'm your supervisor.

602
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:36,670
I'm in charge of supervising the work of your department

603
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:38,850
and protecting your department.

604
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:48,090
You work for Her Ladyship, right?

605
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:50,950
Not exactly.

606
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,720
I'm a public officer,

607
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:56,040
not a privately hired soldier.

608
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:58,850
Of course, you can understand it like this.

609
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,290
Why did you do that?

610
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,130
What do you think is the reason?

611
00:43:04,850 --> 00:43:05,910
For the sake of you?

612
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:06,990
No.

613
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,760
You can say that I did it for the sake of Wu Shuang.

614
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,540
But to put it most precisely,

615
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,450
I did it so that I can live like a dog.
