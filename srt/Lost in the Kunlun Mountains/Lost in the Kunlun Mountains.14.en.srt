5
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,410
Ding Yunqi.

6
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,910
Ms. Cui, everyone is here.

7
00:01:58,729 --> 00:01:59,820
Life or death

8
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:01,920
depends on today.

9
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,140
Didn't Ding Yunqi say

10
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,200
he's coming to see Commander Hu tomorrow?

11
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:17,170
He said that

12
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,980
so that we can settle down.

13
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,420
He didn't want us to get involved.

14
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,490
If he comes tomorrow,

15
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,960
he won't be Ding Yunqi.

16
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,880
To be honest, we should try to persuade him.

17
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,480
Ding Yunqi

18
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,370
cannot be persuaded either.

19
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:56,770
Guys,

20
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,100
I can't let anything happen to my brother today.

21
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:03,450
Once the fight starts,

22
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:07,230
please try your best to keep him safe.

23
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,910
If you can't

24
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,640
protect him,

25
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,460
then please take down

26
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,430
more people to die with him.

27
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,680
I will pay back

28
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:25,500
what I owe you

29
00:03:26,970 --> 00:03:28,060
in the next life.

30
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:50,910
You're here too.

31
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,230
Are you here alone?

32
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:57,170
What about you?

33
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,810
All those who can come are here.

34
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,570
Alright.

35
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:03,050
The ghoul didn't raise you for nothing.

36
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,490
I'm doing this for Yunqi.

37
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:08,970
I'll protect him for as long as I can.

38
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,070
If I can't,

39
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,380
I'll die with him.

40
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,120
This way, when I meet Master Ding over there,

41
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,040
I can have an explanation.

42
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,230
Boss,

43
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:29,090
two bowls of wontons.

44
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:30,310
OK.

45
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:33,790
Aim.

46
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,800
Ready.

47
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:46,940
Wait.

48
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,620
Wait.

49
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:55,630
I wish I could see you again.

50
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,930
Bro.

51
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,490
We just met and we are saying goodbye.

52
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,560
You don't know how reluctant I am.

53
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:14,030
I have no choice.

54
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:15,830
You forced me.

55
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:18,350
Commander.

56
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,160
If you want to kill us,

57
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,430
just do it. No need to drag.

58
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,810
If you don't want to kill us,

59
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,370
just say what you want to say.

60
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,350
This kind of scene

61
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,070
does nothing to threaten me.

62
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,000
Good.

63
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,940
Give me the dragon bone, and I'll release you immediately.

64
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,460
I won't give you the dragon bone.

65
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,780
If I give it to you,

66
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,790
we are really dead.

67
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,690
You've thought it through?

68
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:47,580
I don't even need to think about it.

69
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,600
We all know it.

70
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,790
See them off for me.

71
00:05:53,670 --> 00:05:54,510
Get ready.

72
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,150
Her Ladyship won't let you go.

73
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,900
Her Ladyship can only hear the living ones talk.

74
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,080
Aim.

75
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:06,990
Commander, Ding Yunqi is here.

76
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,040
Who?

77
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,130
Ding Yunqi.

78
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:16,480
How many people?

79
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,530
Just him.

80
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,330
Let him wait in the living room.

81
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,470
Yes.

82
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,870
Just shoot. No need to report.

83
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,170
I can hear the sound.

84
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:25,890
Commander.

85
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,870
If you really hear the sound,

86
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,970
you'll be dead soon.

87
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,080
Shut up. I don't want to listen to you.

88
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,140
Fengling has

89
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,820
met with Ding Yunqi several times

90
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:41,000
on behalf of Her Ladyship.

91
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,810
You're not well-informed.

92
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:44,830
Let me tell you.

93
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,760
I'm not the one who wants the Kunlun Mountains,

94
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,230
but Her Ladyship.

95
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,290
If they shoot,

96
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,600
it equals you declaring war against Her Ladyship.

97
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:58,770
Also,

98
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:01,580
Ding Yunqi is the Heaven Official of Penta-sect.

99
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:04,020
Thousands of their brothers are scattered in the martial artists community.

100
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,330
It's not easy for you

101
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,140
to kill him.

102
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:14,900
Do you know why I haven't interrogated you?

103
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:16,870
Go ahead.

104
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,440
I just don't want to listen to you.

105
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:22,330
I'm done talking.

106
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:28,420
Commander,

107
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,270
why don't we...

108
00:07:31,450 --> 00:07:32,409
Suspend it.

109
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,130
Yes.

110
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:40,470
Put it down.

111
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,050
Stop.

112
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,620
It's not time to rush.

113
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,270
Even if we'll rush, you Sun Sanxuan can't be the first.

114
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,780
Sit down for now.

115
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,610
Today I get the feeling that

116
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,120
you are still like a member of Penta-sect.

117
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:31,460
You have no right to mention Penta-sect.

118
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,190
I won't let your mistakes go

119
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,419
just because of what you did today.

120
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,490
Sit down and have a bowl of wonton.

121
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,919
We still don't know if we can have it again

122
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,520
after today.

123
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,230
Okay.

124
00:08:53,510 --> 00:08:54,560
After today,

125
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,950
if we can survive,

126
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,750
we'll settle the score later.

127
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,420
Young Heaven Official.

128
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:41,220
Hello, Commander Hu.

129
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,680
Young man, you look very fashionable.

130
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,580
I wonder if I came in time.

131
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,720
Are my friends still alive?

132
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,530
What does it matter

133
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,590
if they are alive or not?

134
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,420
If they're alive, I'll sit down and talk to you.

135
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:03,820
If they're dead, let's part here.

136
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:05,750
Oh right.

137
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,100
You are here to save them.

138
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,760
You came at the right time.

139
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,950
I searched everywhere for you a while ago.

140
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,720
I didn't expect

141
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,660
you to come here yourself today.

142
00:10:23,510 --> 00:10:26,290
Is this an accident or a surprise?

143
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,800
What does Commander want from me?

144
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:33,340
What can I possibly ask from you, Young Heaven Official?

145
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:35,360
For the Kunlun Mountains?

146
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,950
What else can it be?

147
00:10:38,630 --> 00:10:39,810
Her Ladyship asked me

148
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,990
to keep in touch with Chu Fengling about the Kunlun Mountains.

149
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,590
What now?

150
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,740
Did she reassign this task to you, Commander?

151
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,290
That's because

152
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:56,150
Her Ladyship is not very satisfied

153
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,240
with the progress of this matter.

154
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,560
I made it clear to Chu Fengling that

155
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,700
whether the Kunlun Mountains open or not

156
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,630
is up to the Ding family.

157
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,560
Her Ladyship can't do anything,

158
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,790
nor the government.

159
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,940
Her Ladyship knows very well that

160
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,870
the initiative is in my hands.

161
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,140
With her power, even she didn't use violence.

162
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:23,070
Haven't you gone too far,

163
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:25,210
Commander Hu?

164
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,630
Young man, you are putting on such airs

165
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,890
that it seems

166
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,200
the Kunlun Mountains are very mysterious.

167
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,850
If it's not mysterious,

168
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,030
it wouldn't have been hidden so well

169
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,710
for hundreds of years.

170
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,700
The Ding family has been Heaven Official for generations,

171
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,850
guarding the Kunlun Mountains.

172
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,650
It wasn't by luck.

173
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:54,480
Young man,

00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,370
what it is in the Kunlun Mountains?

176
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:07,540
I'm not here to talk about the Kunlun Mountains with you today.

177
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,950
Oh right.

178

You are here to save them.

179
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,080
Will you release them or not, Commander?

180

Do you think I'm some gas? Released at your will?

181

If you let my friends go today, Commander,

182

Of course not.

192

Please do me a favor today.

you are indeed powerful.

203

After all, the Ding family didn't survive

204

210

The lady warrior right now.

211
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:52,500
Why don't you release them all if you want to, Commander?

212
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:57,240
Luo is your enemy.

213
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,550
Why would you save him?

214
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,810
I don't want my friend to be sad for a lifetime

215

because of his death.

I guess you didn't grow up by the Yangtze River,

As long as it's related to the Kunlun Mountains,

220

it's part of

your dragon bone

231

is in Luo Yunsong's hands.

You save Luo Yunsong

Can that dragon bone really open the Kunlun Mountains?

235

If someone told you

236
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,790
one dragon bone can open the Kunlun Mountains,

237

If it's just for the dragon bone,

242
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,340
it would be too simple.

243

on that useless dragon bone, did you?

where the Kunlun Mountains are, right?

I know it when I'm in a good mood.

You're quite humorous, young man.

Yunqi. Wu Shuang.

346
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,480
Are you okay?

347
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:15,820
Brother.

348
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,170
I...

349
00:23:18,470 --> 00:23:19,350
What?

350
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,740
I didn't know you can also stutter

351
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:22,080
and not know how to speak.

352
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,760
God isn't blind.

353
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,490
Unfortunately,

354
00:23:26,910 --> 00:23:28,340
Luo Yunsong got lucky.

355
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,440
He survived

356
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:31,530
because of Wu Shuang.

357
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:33,550
Where is my master?

358
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,020
Your master...

359
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,760
Where is your master?

360
00:23:40,310 --> 00:23:41,110
He was just here.

361
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:44,380
By the way, Yunqi,

362
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,350
I have something to tell you.

363
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,780
Don't worry.

364
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,840
I didn't trade the Kunlun Mountains with them.

365
00:23:50,350 --> 00:23:51,690
I knew you wouldn't betray Penta-sect.

366
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,420
Take these away.

367
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:06,050
They look scary.

is really quite evil.

370
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,550
It doesn't matter if he's evil or god.

371
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,230
I'm just glad he's all right.

372
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:18,740
Yes.

373
00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,710
I'll go check on Commander Hu.

374
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:22,180
OK.

375
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:26,170
Cui Yi.

376
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,650

I didn't take good care of Jiutian.

Brother.

Give the dragon bone

383
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,750
back to him.

384
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,110
I will.

385
00:26:52,030 --> 00:26:52,830
Pork knuckles.

386
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:53,800
Okay.

Pig ears.

388
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:55,810
Okay.

389
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:57,370
And trotters.

390
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,670
Right.

391
00:26:58,710 --> 00:26:59,470
The tofu you put

392
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:01,230
in the pork trotter last time was really delicious.

393
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,360
Put it in too.

394
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,580
Okay.

My lady.

00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:05,300
No need to go on.

397
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:06,440
I'll just buy you a whole pig.

398
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,240
It'll do, right?

399
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,200
Eat whatever you want.

400
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:09,710
Don't think about it. I'll go buy it now.

401
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:11,390
Otherwise, we won't have time to cook it.

402
00:27:12,230 --> 00:27:12,950
Do you want apples?

403
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,000
Apples?

404
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:15,130
Yes.

405
00:27:15,850 --> 00:27:17,190
But I only want them from Yunqi.

406
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:28,780

Do you want the cheese bread as well?

No.

410
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,140
It tastes sour. Not good.

411
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,370
But their sausages are pretty good.

412
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,160
The sausages are delicious.

413

Enough. It's none of your business.

I'm leaving.

None of your business. Did you hear him?

Brother,

423
00:27:57,970 --> 00:27:59,570
your position...

424
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:04,440
It's so unfair.

426
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,370
How is it?

427
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,920
It's open.

428
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,610
Is there anything?

What are you looking at?

430
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,870
Don't you know how many sisters-in-law there are?

Yes.

433
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:35,220
Commander, so many things.

434
00:28:35,350 --> 00:28:36,780
My men are watching.

435
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,260
I want you to check it yourself when you are there.

436
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,440
Great.

437
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:49,250
Everything will be fine if we dig something out.

438
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:52,740
What are you two waiting for?

439
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,040
Keep an eye on them.

440
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:58,870
Before I go in,

441
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,140
no one should enter.

442
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:02,770
Understood.

God doesn't want me to die.

447
00:29:22,390 --> 00:29:23,730
God doesn't want me to die.

448
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:27,470
Great.

449
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,230
As long as there's something there,

450
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:31,170
everything will be fine.

451
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:34,570
I have an explanation to Her Ladyship too.

452
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,230
After I

453
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,960
take this set of wealth

454
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:43,930
and take good care of

455
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,030

457
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:54,430
Let's talk about it later.

458
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,560
Open the door.

459
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,350
Yunqi.

460
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:45,460
Wu Shuang.

461
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:47,220
We are

462
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,370
even now.

463
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,050
You kept your word.

464
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,320
Thank you.

465
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:06,120
You're welcome.

466
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:09,150
But I have a clear distinction between kindness and hatred.

467
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,660
I owe you this time.

468
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,850
But some things

469
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,570
are still not over

470
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,250
that need to be cleared up.

471
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:22,080
Director Luo.

472
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:25,820
My condolences.

473
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:06,560
Luo Jiutian

474
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:10,000
died just like that.

475
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,160
San Jin.

476
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:19,960
I'm hungry.

477
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,300
Go buy some food and cook.

478
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:23,130
Brother, let's go together.

479
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,490
I can't carry too many things.

480
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:26,100
I'll accompany you.

481
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,030
Let's go.

482
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,980
When we were brought to the yard,

483
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,330
I was really scared.

484
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,830
I was so afraid that

485
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,510
I'll never see you again.

486
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,290
I told you not to go.

487
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,860
Don't cry.

488
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:01,870
If I didn't go,

489
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,220
how could we get the dragon bone back?

490
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,770
I said I'll find a way.

491
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,900
No way.

492
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,670
I was the one who lost the dragon bone.

493
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,600
I have to get it back myself.

494
00:33:21,110 --> 00:33:21,860
I didn't even have time to take a closer look at

495
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:25,140
the dragon bone.

496
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,110
Yunqi.

497
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,280
Look.

498
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,300
The dragon bone is so beautiful.

499
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:40,380
After going through so many things,

500
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:41,980
we finally get it back.

501
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,580
The two dragon bones are finally together.

502
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:46,390
At least I can

503
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,660
give my father an explanation.

504
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,940
Should we also

505
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,760
get together?

506
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:58,990
What?

507
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,790
Engagement.

508
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:06,800
Why are you bringing this up again?

509
00:34:09,350 --> 00:34:10,880
I've got the dragon bone back.

510
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,460
Do you still disagree?

511
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:15,830
Yes, I disagree.

512
00:34:17,429 --> 00:34:18,600
Why?

513
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:20,449
To get back the dragon bone,

514
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,750
I almost died.

515
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,760
You still disagree?

516
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,460
You went to Her Ladyship and Commander Hu

517
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,590
to save me, didn't you?

518
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,350
Of course I did.

519
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,370
Then why are you like this?

520
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,520
Don't you know

521
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:40,570
why I disagree?

522
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:43,000
You can risk your life for me,

523
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,420
then why can't you be Heaven Official?

524
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,480
If I choose Penta-sect for you,

525
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:48,810
I won't be happy.

526
00:34:54,199 --> 00:34:54,850
Wu Shuang,

527
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,570
can you stop sticking to

528
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,870
those useless principles?

529
00:34:59,130 --> 00:34:59,680
Isn't it good

530
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,110
to be happy like we are right now?

531
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:03,580
But I want a home.

532
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:05,100
A home.

533
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,230
I don't want it.

534
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:19,960
At least not now.

535
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,440
I object to Penta-sect,

536
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,330
and also the old-fashioned marriage.

537
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:30,880
Also,

538
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:32,700
I don't want to get married easily.

539
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,900
I thought this was my home.

540
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Guess I was wrong.

541
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,060
Master.

542
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,640
Wu Shuang.

543
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,320
You're back.

544
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:06,240
It's good that you are back.

545
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:10,060
Master, I'm sorry

546
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:12,660
for causing trouble to you and our brothers.

547
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,320
Silly girl.

548
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,210
What is home for?

549
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,110
It's just a place

550
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,670
to give you shelter

551
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:25,390
and a hand when you need it.

552
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:28,910
You came back just in time.

553
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,980
I wanted to send someone to look for you.

554
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:34,840
What can I do for you, Master?

555
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,350
Nothing special.

556
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:38,870
Just all of us having dinner together, calmly.

557
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,090
Let's go.

558
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:40,720
Come.

559
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,400
Brothers are waiting for you.

560
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,500
Let's go.

561
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:51,220
What have you been up to lately?

562
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:52,310
Master is here.

563
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,110
Master is here.

564
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,010
-Master. -Master.

565
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:01,630
Here.

566
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:21,410
Sit.

567
00:39:30,110 --> 00:39:31,910
August 15th, the Mid-Autumn Festival. Full moon.

568
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:34,220
It should be the day of family reunion.

569
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:35,190
But this year,

570
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,460
due to master's work,

571
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:41,320
I didn't get to be with you.

572
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:42,620
Today,

573
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:44,430
let's make up for it.

574
00:39:47,450 --> 00:39:48,630
The strings and drums are in harmony.

575
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:50,980
It's a blessing for our children.

576
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:53,960
Here.

577
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:58,880
Father gave birth to me. Master teaches me.

578
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,810
Comfort me, foster me,

579
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:02,400
grow me, raise me,

580
00:40:02,530 --> 00:40:04,130
take care of me, and reply to me.

581
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,440
Wish you good health, Master.

582
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:08,720
Here.

583
00:40:13,950 --> 00:40:14,580
Sit.

584
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,840
Wu Shuang

585
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,330
survived today

586
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:25,500
and came back safely.

587
00:40:26,010 --> 00:40:27,310
I'm very happy today.

588
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,500
Since I became Sect Leader,

589
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,150
the Mound-digging Sect hasn't got involved in the martial artists community.

590
00:40:35,710 --> 00:40:36,990
You haven't got

591
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,590
a chance to go fight in the cruel battlefield.

592
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,210
But when Wu Shuang was in trouble,

593
00:40:42,930 --> 00:40:45,440
everyone took the sword to fight without hesitation

594
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,610
and no one chickened out.

595
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,900
I am very pleased.

596
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,170
I'll make an exception

597
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:54,480
today.

598
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,420
No teacher, no father, no seniority.

599
00:40:57,970 --> 00:40:59,190
Let's drink to our hearts' content.

600
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,290
-Yes. -Yes.

601
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:04,060
Here.

602
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,610
-Cheers. -Cheers.

603
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,440
Master.

604
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:16,360
Here's to you.

605
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,830
Sorry for all the trouble.

606
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,880
Here.

607
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:28,670
Sit.

608
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,950
To all of you.

609
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:34,930
Cheers!

610
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,190
-Cheers! -Cheers!

611
00:42:11,930 --> 00:42:13,020
This is it.

612
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:15,960
How is it?

613
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:19,530
The great place specially selected by the Commander.

614
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:22,590
He was afraid that Jiutian would get lonely,

615
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:26,250
so he even found so many lonely ghosts to keep him company

616
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,720
and chat with him.

617
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:41,540
Bro.

618
00:42:43,340 --> 00:42:46,030
We're both just following our seniors' orders.

619
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,200
There's no need to be so harsh to me.

620
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:56,660
Did Jiutian leave anything behind?

621
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:05,520
A stick.

622
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:12,740
Catch up.

623
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,610
Let's go.

624
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,080
Jiutian.

625
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,090
When you get there,

626
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:38,650
be a good man and take the right path.

627
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:41,010
Don't cause trouble.

628
00:43:42,730 --> 00:43:44,070
If someone bullies you,

629
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:46,760
learn to be patient and tolerant.

630
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:49,570
After I send all the people

631
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:51,380
who killed you there,

632
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,440
I'll go keep you company.

633
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,550
Wait for me.
