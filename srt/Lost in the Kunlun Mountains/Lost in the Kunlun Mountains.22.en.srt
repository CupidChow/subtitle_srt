00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,490
I like the feeling now.

5
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,460
No disputes and no disturbance.

6
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,620
Just the two of us.

7
00:01:49,729 --> 00:01:50,700
I like it, too.

00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:54,300

After we find the Kunlun Mountains,

00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:45,500
we will live like this every day.

35
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,500
Do we have to find the Kunlun Mountains?

36

♫I would... I would go with you♫

do it.

39

♫Go with you♫

40
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,690
Why must we do it?

41
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,890
Only after the issue of the Kunlun Mountains is solved

42
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,660
can we be together freely.

43
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:06,860
But...

44
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,700
Once we find the Kunlun Mountains,

45
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,070
it might be

46
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,570
impossible for us to be together.

47
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:16,810
Why is it impossible?

48
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:19,810
On the contrary, after we solve these problems,

49
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:21,339
we can be together in peace.

50
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,550
You don't understand.

51
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,860
My master is on one side, and you are on the other side.

52
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:27,620
I...

53
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,560
Wu Shuang.

54
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,200
I want to find the Kunlun Mountains

55
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,770
in order to completely disband the Penta-sect.

56
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:38,170
Then you can leave the Mound-digging Sect.

57
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:39,920
Leave?

58
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,480
How?

59
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,790
That's easy for you to say.

60
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,110
I've been living with them for over 20 years.

61
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,040
How can I leave them just like that?

62
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,140
As my master said,

63
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,530
the Mound-digging Sect is my home.

64
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,250
My home.

65
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,800
We can't just disband it

66
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,930
by a few words.

67
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,610
Wu Shuang,

68
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:06,790
I've been thinking a lot these days.

69
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:08,820
I love you.

70
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,370
I really want to marry you.

71
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,310
I want

72
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:21,040
to be with you all my life.

73
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,510
But I don't want you to marry the Heaven Official.

74
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,190
So,

75
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,020
I think after the Penta-sect is disbanded,

76
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,159
you will no longer be bound by the rules of your sect,

77
00:05:36,159 --> 00:05:37,510
and will become free.

78
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:41,390
Then we can be together without burden,

79
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,260
and live the life we want.

80
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,770
Well,

81
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:52,540
can we look for it later?

82
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,940
Let's look for it

83
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,630
after my master retires.

84
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,220
My master is so old now.

85
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,690
I'm really worried that he will...

86
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,330
After we send my master away,

87
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,260
if you still want to find the Kunlun Mountains,

88
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,320
I'll do it with you.

89
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,090
I'll do it with you even if it takes a lifetime.

90
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,840
Okay?

91
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,240
How do you think

92
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,670
we can stop those things?

93
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:00,030
Once something starts,

94
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,430
it can't stop.

95
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,970
I want to go back.

96
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,910
I've been out for so long.

97
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:10,450
Don't make them worry.

98
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,780
They'll stop once you open that gate.

99
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:26,790
Look.

100
00:07:26,910 --> 00:07:28,440
They can still stop, right?

101
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,470
Wu Shuang.

102
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,700
Stop talking.

103
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,290
Brother.

104
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,940
What are you thinking?

105
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:34,990
Nothing.

106
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,289

What do you think of Yunqi?

109
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:45,280
Pretty good.

110
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,700
Do you like him?

111
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,580
Brother, what are you talking about?

112
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,820
You know what I'm saying.

113
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:55,170
Do you like him?

114
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:58,260
No.

115
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:01,540
Really?

116
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,540
How could I lie to you?

117
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:08,970
Then why were you angry with Yunqi when you were

118
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,650
at the gate of the Yufeng Palace just now?

119
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,970
Was I?

120
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,100
Yes.

121
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:20,590
They had gone too far.

122
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:22,370
Everyone was so worried about them.

123
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,850
We were afraid something would happen to them.

124
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:26,050
But it turned out that

125
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,870
they were having fun inside.

126
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:30,140
That was too much.

127
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,470
If you say so,

128
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,030
I can understand.

130
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,310
I also think Yunqi is good.

131
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:44,000
But after all, he and Wu Shuang...

132

Brother.

133
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,310
I don't have a crush on him.

134
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,370
You think too much.

135
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:49,750
I hope so.

We've been walking for so long.

138
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,440
I'm a bit hungry.

139
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:21,130
I wonder what delicious food San Jin has made.

Why don't I feel hungry?

Why don't you go back and eat first?

144
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,920
I didn't fully enjoy myself just now.

You guys eat first. Don't wait for me.

We'll starve to death if he still doesn't come back.

You're finally back. Have a seat.

Yunqi, if you still didn't come back,

Well,

174
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,820
how about we wait for Wu Shuang?

175
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,720
No, just leave some for her.

176
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:44,300
Eat.

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,730
There's no Soul Pursuit Order?

178
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:53,200
It's just a book?

179
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,170
What does it say?

180
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,410
I don't know.

181
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,340
There were many traps.

182
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,560
I stood behind him,

183
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:08,030
so I didn't see it.

184
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:11,220
What is the book for?

185
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,410
He didn't say.

186
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,810
Did you ask him?

187
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,090
Yes, I did.

188
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:19,330
He said it was related to the Kunlun Mountains anyway.

189
00:13:19,330 --> 00:13:20,860
But he was not sure, either.

190
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,620
What you did before you went

191
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,070
out of the Yufeng Palace?

192
00:13:28,570 --> 00:13:30,460
We didn't do anything, master.

193
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,250
For that Yufeng Palace,

194
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:38,810
the pearls

195
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:41,140
in the mouths of the gargoyles on its eaves

196
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:42,880
have slid back inside now.

197
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:45,530
What?

198
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,350
In other words,

199
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,200
Yufeng Palace is a land of death now.

200
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,520
Even if a mountain mover gets inside,

201
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:56,380
he won't be able to come out alive.

202
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:59,420
All the traps inside it have been activated.

203
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:01,370
I don't know, master.

204
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:06,910
Yunqi must have

205
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,740
turned on the defense device.

206
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,340
This is strange.

207
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,870
How come Yunqi is so familiar with

208
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,310
mountain mover's traps?

209
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,070
Did he mention to you that

210
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:24,330
he had contact with any mountain movers?

211
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:25,520
I asked him.

212
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:26,650
I was also curious

213
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,950
as to why he was so familiar with the traps there

214
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,460
after we entered the Yufeng Palace.

215
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,010
He said

216
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,660
his father had asked him to memorize these things since he was a child.

217
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:34,080
He couldn't remember some of them clearly.

218
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,010
There was trap

219
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,350
which he opened after trying a few times.

220
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,380
So,

221
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:43,080
the Heaven Official has information about

222
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:46,350
the traps of each branch of the Penta-sect?

223
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,620
He didn't say that.

224
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:55,380
In the future, if you encounter a situation like this,

225
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,040
you must observe and ask more.

226
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,440
Otherwise,

227
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:01,340
we won't be able to learn about Yunqi's progress.

228
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,650
Got it, master.

229
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,210
Master.

230
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:07,660
I saw the Mandarin Duck Nine-grid Gate.

231
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,210
Tell me.

232
00:15:11,630 --> 00:15:12,630
How did he open it?

233
00:15:14,870 --> 00:15:17,510
I was standing behind him. I didn't see it.

234
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,350
What a pity.

235
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:28,680
It was built by mountain movers through hundreds of years' effort.

236
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,360
I have no chance to go inside

237
00:15:30,490 --> 00:15:33,290
or see the charm the amazing design of their traps.

238
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:36,050
Wu Shuang.

239
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:38,930
You may be

240
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,200
the only outsider

241
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,590
who entered and exited the Yufeng Palace safely.

242
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,430
Really?

243
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,750
Has no one else got inside except for

244
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:48,950
the mountain movers?

245
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,620
In the Yufeng Palace, passages are reserved

246
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,550
for each branch of the Penta-sect.

247
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,990
But when each sect enters the palace,

248
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,330
their area of action

249
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,920
is stipulated by the rule.

250
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,650
I see.

251
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:05,100
I saw the portrait of the founder of our Mound-digging Sect.

252
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,570
When I knelt down and kowtowed,

253
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,160
the door behind the shrine of Yufeng Palace

254
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,250
suddenly closed.

255
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,820
I saw the Mandarin Duck Nine-grid Gate

256
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:14,000
at that time.

257
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,110
Because other sects

258
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,380
are not qualified to enter

259
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,980
the mountain mover's secret room, the Maze Pit.

260
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,910
You were able to enter the Maze Pit.

261
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,590
I think the reason must be that

262
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:27,190
you followed Yunqi

263
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,870
to walk through the Heaven Official's Channel.

264
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,090
That's right. Master, you're amazing.

265
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,320
You described it as if you had seen it with your own eyes.

266
00:16:35,550 --> 00:16:38,810
The Yufeng Palace is the headquarters of mountain movers.

267
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:42,220
The memorial tablets of each branch's founder enshrined and worshiped there.

268
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,070
People of each branch are allowed to get inside.

269
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:44,830
However,

270
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,720
if you want to go somewhere else,

271
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,270
and they don't want you to go,

272
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:49,870
you won't be able to go there.

273
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,600
If I can enter the headquarters,

274
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,400
what other places can't I enter?

275
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,230
Over there.

276
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,640
Dengkun Pavilion.

277
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:08,140
Except for the mountain-moving Taoists,

278
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,470
no one can get inside it.

279
00:17:10,569 --> 00:17:12,030
What's inside it, master?

280
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,160
Except for secrets, what else can it be?

281
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,430
To put it bluntly,

282
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,800
it's all about the Kunlun Mountains.

283
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,670
What a pity.

284
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:32,140
The Penta-sect has gone through decline.

285
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:33,490
The legends back then

286
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,650
are doomed to become tales one by one.

287
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,650
By the way,

288
00:17:42,950 --> 00:17:44,340
did Luo Yunsong

289
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,750
act differently on the way?

290
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:47,620
No.

291
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:49,250
He has been very cooperative.

292
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,250
He listens to Yunqi for everything.

293
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,090
He's so calm.

294
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,650
Pay more attention to him.

295
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,430
If he has any ulterior motive,

296
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,050
report to me immediately.

297
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:03,870
Yes, master.

298
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,210
Okay.

299
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,260
Go back now.

300
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,370
Don't arouse their suspicion.

301
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,540
I'm going back, master.

302
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,320
How many people?

303
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,720
According to the information from the Black Feather Team,

304
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,250
there were about 30 people.

305
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:32,360
Was Zhou Qiuhai there, too?

306
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,730
Yes.

307
00:18:34,070 --> 00:18:37,330
A few disciples of the Mound-digging Sect were also there.

308
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,550
I knew it.

309
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:40,830
Why did Wu Shuang suddenly

310
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,360
come here with Yunqi alone?

311
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:43,350
It turns out

312
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,620
such a group of vicious men followed her.

313
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,100
Does Zhou Qiuhai have to take this road

314
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,340
to go back to the Mound-digging Sect?

315
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,170
They can choose to take it or not to take it.

316
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,160
But they only took the small paths.

317
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,730
It seemed they wanted to hide their whereabouts on purpose.

318
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:02,860
It was more likely that they wanted to stalk us secretly.

319
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,050
That's right.

320
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,780
Yunqi has started to look for the treasures.

321
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,640
How can no one pay attention to it?

322
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:09,890
Both the Mound-digging Sect and the Gold Touching Sect were there.

323
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,420
I don't think it's strange.

324
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,500
I also don't feel surprised

325
00:19:14,810 --> 00:19:17,070
that some other persons were also there.

326
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,150
Brother,

327
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,910
do you mean

328
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,590
Wu Shuang may be a spy

329
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,390
sent by the Mound-digging Sect?

330
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:28,570
Not necessarily.

331
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,040
It's not strange if she is.

332
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:36,230
Fengling.

333
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,310
Fengling.

334
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,530
Fengling.

335
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:50,380
Yunqi.

336
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:57,890
Have you had dinner?

337
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:00,960
Just a few bites.

338
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:04,670
Where is Wu Shuang?

339
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,260
She wants to take a walk alone,

340
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:13,740
and enjoy the view of the mountain movers' headquarters.

341
00:20:14,570 --> 00:20:17,130
There are so many differences between different people indeed.

342
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,390
We are trapped in the hotel

343
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,650
and can't go anywhere.

344
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,120
She can go out with you

345
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,450
and walk around freely.

346
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:25,610
Aren't you worried that she's in danger?

347
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,300
She knows all the traps,

348
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,380
and I believe she won't touch them arbitrarily.

349
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:32,840
Well,

350
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:35,830
aren't you worried that we'll be in danger?

351
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,070
What do you mean?

352
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:45,270
Zhou Qiuhai has been stalking us secretly.

353
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:46,660
Do you know?

354
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:52,160
I really don't know.

355
00:20:52,870 --> 00:20:53,970
Now you know it.

356
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,280
Don't you think

357
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,170
if Wu Shuang suddenly came back to look for the Kunlun Mountains with us,

358
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:00,830
it might not be a coincidence?

359
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:06,260
What are you trying to say?

360
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:08,290
Yunqi.

361
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,340
You've always been a decent gentleman.

362
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:13,370
There are some things you won't do and you won't think about.

363
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:15,010
But some people are evil-hearted.

364
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,740
You have to guard against them.

365
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:18,530
Yunqi.

366
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:22,150
Fengling doesn't mean to suspect Wu Shuang.

367
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,410
She just suddenly found Zhou Qiuhai

368
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,670
had been following us.

369
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:26,680
For the sake of safety,

370
00:21:26,790 --> 00:21:29,250
we told you this, and want you to be prepared.

371
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:31,700
Are you done?

372
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,990
I'm not done yet.

373
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:39,960
You are all here.

374
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,490
Wu Shuang,

375
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:45,980
where have you been?

376
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,550
I took a walk around the town.

377
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,850
I heard a lot about

378
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,820
the tales of the Mountain-moving Town.

379
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,170
I just went to feel it.

380
00:22:00,410 --> 00:22:01,290
Did you encounter

381
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,690
any interesting things?

382
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,770
Tell us.

383
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,090
It's all about the geomantic omen.

384
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:09,490
You won't be interested.

385
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:10,750
Wu Shuang.

386
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,830
Come and eat.

387
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:14,480
Otherwise, all the food will be eaten by Sanxuan.

388
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,280
Coming.

389
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,540
Let's go, Yunqi. Let's have dinner.

390
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,920
Are you done? Let's go.

391
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:25,440
No.

392
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,380
Wu Shuang, we're waiting for you two.

393
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,090
Wu Shuang.

394
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,180
Did you see your master

395
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,710
when you were out this time?

396
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:38,790
I...

397
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,810
Your master led the disciples of the Mound-digging Sect

398
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,810
to follow us here.

399
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,240
He would find a chance to see you and talk to you, right?

400
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,880
Your master must want to know

401
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,010
what happened to Yunqi

402
00:22:55,010 --> 00:22:56,610
in the Yufeng Palace, right?

403
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:03,960
Wu Shuang,

404
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,210
did you tell it to your master

405
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,670
in the way I had taught you?

406
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:14,660
What?

407
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:16,090
You went to see your master.

408
00:23:16,090 --> 00:23:17,180
Did you tell it to your master

409
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,640
in the way I had taught you?

410
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,550
You know she's a spy from the Mound-digging Sect?

411
00:23:26,550 --> 00:23:28,020
Of course. Besides,

412
00:23:28,270 --> 00:23:29,470
I asked her to do that.

413
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,910
Why?

414
00:23:35,910 --> 00:23:37,380
I want her to be with me.

415
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:43,680
Do you know

416
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,150
how dangerous it will be?

417
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:48,210
Zhou Qiuhai has been hostile towards us.

418
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,860
Besides, on the issue of the Kunlun Mountains,

419
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,040
he has held a firm attitude all the time.

420
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:54,180
He'll kill whoever tries to open the Kunlun Mountains.

421
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,580
Have you ever considered about our safety?

422
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,500
Sorry.

423
00:23:58,470 --> 00:23:59,770
I did make this decision

424
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,110
by myself.

425
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,610
But it's not dangerous.

426
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,020
Besides, I won't make any decision that will

427
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,680
make all of us get into danger.

428
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,210
Then you should have told us first.

429
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,430
According to our previous contract,

430
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,530
I don't need to explain

431
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,790
all the details to you.

432
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,430
If you think it's dangerous, you can quit.

433
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:22,540
Besides, looking for the Kunlun Mountains

434
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,180
is a dangerous task.

435
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,960
If you don't have the courage to face it,

436
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,500
I suggest you should consider

437
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,320
whether you want to keep going.

438
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:43,360
Alright. We've made it clear.

439
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,760
It's good if there's no misunderstanding.

440
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,890
Let's go, Fengling.

441
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:49,080
Wait.

442
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,060
I did join you

443
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,670
under the order of my master.

444
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,040
But I'm not a spy.

445
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:03,900
My master knows that Yunqi

446
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,790
is determined to find the Kunlun Mountains.

447
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:08,980
He was worried that he would encounter all kinds of dangers on the way,

448
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,620
so he asked me to follow Yunqi.

449
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,590
Once there's danger,

450
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:14,320
my master will bring our people to protect Yunqi.

451
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:20,990
Thank you for your master's concern.

452
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,000
Why couldn't you make it clear?

453
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,390
Why did you have to conceal it

454
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:30,190
as if you were guarding against someone?

455
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:31,030
Why else?

456
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,560
It's all because of your brother.

457
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:34,560
Me?

458
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:37,420
Yunqi and I are on the same side.

459
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:38,590
Your Black Feather Team

460
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:40,310
has been following us with arms.

461
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,950
Who knows what you're up to?

462
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:44,350
The Black Feather Team is following us.

463
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,860
At first, Yunqi and I had a deal,

464
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,660
and he agreed.

465
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,830
You can ask him if you don't believe me.

466
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,200
That's because Yunqi is kind and willing to trust people.

467
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:53,330
I don't believe you.

468
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:54,760
Alright.

469
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,950
Now we've made it clear, right?

470
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,630
We've made it clear, huh?

471
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:00,140
I don't want any more misunderstandings.

472
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:01,270
Alright. Let's eat.

473
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,080
Fengling, let's eat.

474
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:15,900
Let's eat.

475
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:35,670
Brother.

476
00:26:36,130 --> 00:26:37,460
I'm going out for a walk.

477
00:26:38,150 --> 00:26:38,860
In the town...

478
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:39,660
I know.

479
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,630
Just now on the way to the Yufeng Palace,

480
00:26:41,630 --> 00:26:43,090
nothing happened, right?

481
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,310
I'll just take a walk along the same way. It'll be fine.

482
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,510
Go.

483
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,240
Go with her.

484
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:22,920
Yunqi.

485
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,460
Are you angry with me?

486
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:27,500
Why?

487
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,320
I didn't tell you the truth.

488
00:27:33,330 --> 00:27:34,730
Haven't you just said it?

489
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:37,790
Do you blame me?

490
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,780
Your master

491
00:27:42,070 --> 00:27:42,990
is a

492
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,470
rigid and stubborn old man.

493
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:47,380
But he's not a bad old man.

494
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,240
He always thinks that

495
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:52,020
protecting the Penta-sect and the Kunlun Mountains

496
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,990
is his mission.

497
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:53,900
Therefore,

498
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,720
no matter how much I disagree with him,

499
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:59,230
he won't stake the Kunlun Mountains on it.

500
00:27:59,710 --> 00:28:00,250
So,

501
00:28:01,090 --> 00:28:02,310
he tries to protect me,

502
00:28:02,310 --> 00:28:03,640
and I'm quite grateful.

503
00:28:05,130 --> 00:28:06,550
Why are you so nice?

504
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,710
That's what my master said.

505
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,640
Luo Yunsong has been following you

506
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,750
with the Black Feather Team.

507
00:28:15,370 --> 00:28:17,030
They even have guns with them.

508
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:19,320
What if something bad happens?

509
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,480
Wu Shuang,

510
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,500
you have some misunderstanding

511
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,560
about Luo Yunsong.

512
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,190
But he insists that

513
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,850
Uncle Ding killed his father.

514
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,300
A father's debt is paid by his son.

515
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,320
That's the rule of the martial artists community.

516
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,290
Moreover, he is so docile this time.

517
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,290
That's abnormal.

518
00:28:39,270 --> 00:28:40,030
I think

519
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,500
he has a bad intention.

520
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,470
Yunqi.

521
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:44,900
You must be careful.

522
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,290
In my opinion,

523
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:48,340
you shouldn't have taken him with you.

524
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:50,000
Luo Yunsong has many secrets.

525
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,300
I'm very interested. I want to know the answer.

526
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,100
Besides,

527
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,790
I also want to find a chance to clear up

528
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,800
all his misunderstandings about my father.

529
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,000
By taking him with me,

530
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:01,650
it'll be helpful for

531
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,560
both these two things to develop towards a better direction.

532
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,230
As for you,

533
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,260
I will always trust you unconditionally.

534
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,160
I will never believe that you will betray me.

535
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:22,740
Yunqi.

536
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,520
Yunqi.

537
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,110
I didn't dare to tell you

538
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:37,440
because I was worried that you wouldn't understand my master.

539
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,700
Don't blame me.

540
00:29:41,010 --> 00:29:42,540
As long as you're by my side,

541
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,510
I can understand whatever you do.

542
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,440
Why are you so sweet?

543
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,830
Tell me more.

544
00:29:50,710 --> 00:29:51,970
I'm telling the truth.

545
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,020
If you want to hear it,

546
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:55,750
I'll tell you if there's another truth next time.

547
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,470
By the way, Yunqi,

548
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,410
have you long known that

549
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,790
I went to see my master?

550
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:02,850
Yes.

551
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:04,990
When did you know?

552
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:07,510
You are

553
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,940
very curious.

554
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,410
When you encounter problems,

555
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,070
you'll get to the bottom of it.

556
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,100
But this time,

557
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,500
I found that you had changed.

558
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,430
When we talked about the Kunlun Mountains,

559
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,070
you would deliberately hide away,

560
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,670
not asking about or hearing it.

561
00:30:21,670 --> 00:30:22,720
From then on,

562
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:24,310
I have known

563
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,710
your master must have given you a task.

564
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,520
You didn't want to lie to your master,

565
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:31,620
so you just hid away, not asking about or hearing it.

566
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,080
Then you can know nothing.

567
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,770
When your master asks,

568
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,060
it won't be considered as lying to your master, right?

569
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,000
You know me well.

570
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:47,370
Just now when Fengling asked me,

571
00:30:47,370 --> 00:30:49,030
why did you help me explain it?

572
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,610
Fengling has changed a lot these days.

573
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,000
I don't want her to have any more

574
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,930
unnecessary misunderstandings.

575
00:30:57,110 --> 00:30:57,970
I also think so.

576
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:01,090
She seems to be a different person now.

577
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:04,070
I should find a chance to talk to her.

578
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,510
Wu Shuang,

579
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:07,780
what else did your master tell you?

580
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:10,130
He said

581
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:11,680
there's a big secret

582
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,430
inside the Dengkun Pavilion.

583
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,980
Dengkun Pavilion?

584
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,190
The building over there which looks like a tower.

585
00:31:24,870 --> 00:31:25,590
What else?

586
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:27,940
My master said

587
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,630
all the secrets of the mountain movers are inside the Dengkun Pavilion.

588
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:31,800
I asked him what they were.

589
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,530
He said

590
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,960
all the secrets of the Penta-sect

591
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,560
are actually related to the Kunlun Mountains.

592
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,100
Wu Shuang,

593
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,950
do you want to go to the Dengkun Pavilion and have fun?

594
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,000
Sure.

595
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:20,860
Wu Shuang,

596
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:21,990
why did you suddenly

597
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:23,130
ask me out for a walk?

598
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,310
Fengling.

599
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:27,030
I've been looking for a chance

600
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:28,120
to talk to you.

601
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,760
I think

602
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:31,710
this time when we are out,

603
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:34,000
you seem different from before.

604
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:35,520
Really?

605
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,110
I don't think so.

606
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,470
Are you angry at me because I

607
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,820
talked about your master?

608
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:42,570
No.

609
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,550
It's my fault.

610
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,870
I shouldn't have kept it from all of you.

611
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,370
Actually, I didn't mean to hide it from you.

612
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,830
I hid it from your brother.

613
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,560
Wu Shuang,

614
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,160
I think there might be some misunderstanding

615
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,580
between you and my brother.

616
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:55,980
What misunderstanding?

617
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,650
He did a lot of bad things, didn't he?

618
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,450
Don't say that. He's my brother.

619
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,050
Although he's not

620
00:33:01,050 --> 00:33:02,730
the director of the police department now,

621
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:05,420
he's still the deputy special commissioner of Her Ladyship.

622
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,520
I don't care whether he's a special commissioner or not.

623
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,370
I don't know how level this position is.

624
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,830
He's just a bad guy anyway.

625
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,030
Forget it.

626
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:15,940
Actually, even if you didn't talk to me,

627
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:18,200
I would talk to you about something, too.

628
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,840
What's the matter?

629
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,890
Don't look at me like that.

630
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,690
Just say it if there's anything.

631
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:33,760
Do you still take me as your sister in your mind?

632
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:34,860
Of course.

633
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,130
Although we have some

634
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:38,640
small conflicts during this period,

635
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,780
we've gone through life and death together.

636
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:42,640
How can I not take you as my sister?

637
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:44,810
Okay.

638
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,200
Then tell me

639
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:47,710
what you and Yunqi found

640
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:48,910
in the Yufeng Palace.

641
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,290
Why do you ask the same question as my master?

642
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:53,510
I really don't know.

643
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:55,860
You two went inside together.

644
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,120
How could you not know?

645
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,240
I only saw a book.

646
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,790
But I don't know

647
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,010
what it says on the book.

648
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:05,810
As there were many traps inside,

649
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:06,990
while Yunqi was reading that book,

650
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,380
he was so far away from me.

651
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,590
I really didn't see anything.

652
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,770
I'm not lying.

653
00:34:14,630 --> 00:34:16,100
Because of this stupid book,

654
00:34:16,100 --> 00:34:18,290
both you and my master don't believe me.

655
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:18,830
I...

656
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,260
I can swear to God.

657
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,870
Okay. I trust you.

658
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:25,929
Can you tell me

659
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:27,780
what the book is used for?

660
00:34:28,620 --> 00:34:29,710
Yunqi told me

661
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,940
it was related to the Kunlun Mountains.

662
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,159
But he was not sure, either.

663
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,219
So he had to read it.

664
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:35,170
Where's the book?

665
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,370
We didn't take it out.

666
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:37,989
He said it belongs to the mountain movers,

667
00:34:37,989 --> 00:34:39,040
so we shouldn't take it out.

668
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,570
Thus, he only read it there.

669
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,060
In this case,

670
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:44,370
this book may be worthless.

671
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,350
Did he tell you

672
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,949
why he came here?

673
00:34:49,699 --> 00:34:50,840
Yunqi just wants to know

674
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,100
if this book is useful.

675
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,250
Probably.

676
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,850
He really didn't tell you anything?

677
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:01,880
No.

678
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,600
Even if he wants to say something,

679
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,490
I won't hear it.

680
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:06,250
If he tells me,

681
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,830
should I tell my master?

682
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,630
Only Yunqi might know

683
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:13,350
where the Kunlun Mountains is.

684
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,650
Don't you care?

685
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,620
Why should I care?

686
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,470
I wonder

687
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:20,310
why you also get involved.

688
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:21,830
I have...

689
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,720
I know you have Her Ladyship's order.

690
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,860
But with this order only,

691
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,920
you can't find the Kunlun Mountains.

692
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:29,180
Well, I really don't understand.

693
00:35:29,390 --> 00:35:30,190
Why do you all

694
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:32,530
care so much about the Kunlun Mountains?

695
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,410
You don't think I'm qualified enough to look for the Kunlun Mountains?

696
00:35:37,410 --> 00:35:38,800
That's not what I meant.

697
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,100
After all,

698
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,870
you have no way of looking for it.

699
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:43,000
How do we look for it?

700
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,510
Besides, do you know

701
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,070
if the Kunlun Mountains is found,

702
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:48,040
how much blood will be shed?

703
00:35:49,010 --> 00:35:50,730
Every action to search for the Kunlun Mountains

704
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,200
will become a tragedy.

705
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,910
Do you want to see those tragedies happen?

706
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,920
Fengling, you take me as your sister.

707
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,020
I sincerely advise you

708
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:03,130
to stop looking for it and go back.

709
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:05,220
I understand.

710
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:06,480
You still don't think

711
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,540
I'm qualified enough to look for the Kunlun Mountains.

712
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:10,260
Right.

713
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,440
You are all from the Penta-sect.

714
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,320
It's perfectly justified for

715
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,750
members of the Penta-sect to look for the Kunlun Mountains.

716
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,010
We may seem redundant.

717
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,080
But let me tell you.

718
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,130
I will never give up.

719
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:23,190
Why is that?

720
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:25,250
My second elder brother died.

721
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,800
We were almost killed by Commander Hu.

722
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,980
Why?

723
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:29,370
It's all because of

724
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:32,850
that Kunlun Mountains whose existence is still open to question.

725
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:33,520
No.

726
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,580
It's because of power.

727
00:36:37,430 --> 00:36:38,900
You may not understand this,

728
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,620
but haven't you thought about it?

729
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,630
Without power,

730
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,390
for some people, it's a luxury

731
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,740
to live humbly.

732
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,060
I don't want to.

733
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:48,170
I won't live like that anymore, too.

734
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:52,340
Why is this related to power now?

735
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:55,620
When I find the Kunlun Mountains,

736
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,820
you will understand.

737
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,950
You don't have to help me now.

738
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:02,460
In terms of the current situation,

739
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,860
you don't want to help me.

740
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:05,360
It's okay.

741
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:09,850
Fengling.

742
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,890
For the mountain movers,

743
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:31,480
they had no guardian and they were called widows.

744
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,200
Back then,

745
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,210
there were all women in this branch,

746
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,140
and they were all legendary women.

747
00:37:36,190 --> 00:37:37,190
Although they didn't directly participate

748
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:38,990
in robbing tombs for treasures,

749
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,730
they were in charge of finance and selling goods.

750
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,750
They were also good at divination and knew how to exorcise evil spirits.

751
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,180
They played a very important part

752
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,240
in the Penta-sect.

753
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:49,380
Their traces were mysterious.

754
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,350
They took orders from the Heaven Official directly.

755
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:52,940
Other members rarely had the chance

756
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,270
to see their true faces.

757
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,560
Some even said that

758
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,400
the Kunlun Mountains was also guarded by them.

759
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:04,360
It's my first time to

760
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,060
hear about these things.

761
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,560
They are all rumors.

762
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:09,830
But if the Kunlun Mountains

763
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,910
was guarded by the mountain movers,

764
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:13,880
I don't think it's strange.

765
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,330
Why?

766
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:17,860
First, ability.

767
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,240
Second, natural instincts.

768
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,500
I understand ability.

769
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:22,430
What do you mean by natural instincts?

770
00:38:22,430 --> 00:38:23,630
Let me put it this way.

771
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,540
All the women of this sect

772
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,670
had no husband or children.

773
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:28,130
Why would they need money?

774
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:29,690
From this point,

775
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,750
the rules of the Mountain-moving Sect

776
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:33,260
are inhumane,

777
00:38:33,430 --> 00:38:34,610
but very practical.

778
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:37,800
Besides,

779
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:39,860
its name,

780
00:38:40,070 --> 00:38:41,750
[Yufeng Palace]

781
00:38:40,450 --> 00:38:41,410
Yufeng Palace,

782
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,440
is derived from A Happy Excursion written by Zhuangzi,

783
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,580
where it talks about Liezi's riding the wind.

784
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,090
It can also prove that

785
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,810
they required the disciples

786
00:38:49,810 --> 00:38:51,540
to be rid of the secular society

787
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,580
since childhood.

788
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:54,850
Stay away from the secular world,

789
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,200
and not be greedy for money.

790
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,800
In that case, isn't it the best choice to let them

791
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,530
protect the Kunlun Mountains?

792
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:04,890
It seems

793
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,620
you really know the Penta-sect well.

794
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,820
Knowing both yourself and your enemy well helps you win every battle.

795
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,410
Got it.

796
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,530
You used to be a soldier.

797
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:16,350
It's normal for you to know the background

798
00:39:16,350 --> 00:39:18,210
of the foe who killed your father.

799
00:39:20,340 --> 00:39:21,200
Now you believe

800
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:24,310
my father didn't kill your family, right?

801
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:26,900
I can only say

802
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,850
I believe that you're not lying.

803
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:29,790
Why?

804
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,610
A father's debt should be paid by his son.

805
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,010
No one would bring their enemies with them.

806
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,070
Thank you.

807
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,160
For what?

808
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,590
Your honesty.

809
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,490
But you can be more honest.

810
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:49,760
To be honest,

811
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,310
looking for the Kunlun Mountains with you

812
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:53,060
is a way to

813
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,150
kill two birds with one stone for me.

814
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,090
If your father is the murderer,

815
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,150
and you are his son,

816
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,370
you'll have to pay the price.

817
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,510
But if your father is not the murderer,

818
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:04,390
and I can find the Kunlun Mountains with you,

819
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,290
then I can make achievements for Her Ladyship.

820
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,750
I can also make a comeback.

821
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,490
That will be great.

822
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,610
You're really honest now.

823
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,200
You're too smart.

824
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:19,730
You could figure it out even if I had not said this to you,

825
00:40:19,730 --> 00:40:21,860
so I don't need to beat around the bush.

826
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:24,850
You never mentioned the mountain movers to me.

827
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,990
You never told me

828
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:28,670
you would come to their Mountain-moving Town.

829
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:31,950
If I tell you

830
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:34,170
I'm going to see the Dengkun Pavilion,

831
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,420
what will you tell me?

832
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:39,400
Dengkun Pavilion?

833
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,320
Yes, Dengkun Pavilion

834
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,580
How do you know Dengkun Pavilion?

835
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,930
I'm a member of the Ding Family.

836
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,730
It's not strange that I know it.

837
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,670
But I think you're quite strange.

838
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,420
It seems you are kind of familiar

839
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,720
with the Dengkun Pavilion.

840
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:56,440
No.

841
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:59,410
Not at all. I just heard about it.

842
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:01,600
About what?

843
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:05,050
Although the Yufeng Palace is the headquarters of the mountain movers,

844
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:06,600
in fact, its real base

845
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,800
is the Dengkun Pavilion.

846
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:10,510
It is said that

847
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:12,230
only mountain movers can enter the Dengkun Pavilion.

848
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,070
Besides,

849
00:41:13,950 --> 00:41:15,150
the Dengkun Pavilion

850
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:18,060
might be the entrance to the Kunlun Mountains.

851
00:41:18,990 --> 00:41:20,710
Who knows? It's just a rumor.

852
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,460
Probably no one knows

853
00:41:22,690 --> 00:41:24,420
where the Dengkun Pavilion is.

854
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,080
But many rumors are not groundless.

855
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,190
Do you know where the Dengkun Pavilion is?

856
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,320
That is the Dengkun Pavilion.

857
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:59,910
I'm going to enter the Dengkun Pavilion soon.

858
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,940
Do you need to remind me of anything?

859
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:05,230
No.

860
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,360
I only have one request.

861
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,530
Can I go with you?

862
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:15,560
I know

863
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:16,870
it doesn't

864
00:42:17,540 --> 00:42:19,050
conform with our agreement.

865
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,850
But Yunqi,

866
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:21,850
after you get inside,

867
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:23,880
you can decide whether I can go inside

868
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:25,810
according to the situation there.

869
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,030
Okay?

870
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,450
What are you looking for?

871
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:35,350
It's certainly not the Kunlun Mountains.
