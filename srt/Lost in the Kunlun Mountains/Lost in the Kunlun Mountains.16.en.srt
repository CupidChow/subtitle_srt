Cigarettes for sale!

6
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:43,259
Come and buy cigarettes.

7
00:01:43,539 --> 00:01:44,930
What's wrong with this brat today?

8
00:01:44,930 --> 00:01:45,500
Cigarettes for sale!

9
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,030
Has he taken the strength pill? He's so noisy.

10
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:28,380
Step aside!

11
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,120
Commander.

12
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:54,050
Sweetie.

13
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,690
No, no, no, little Heaven Official.

14
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,250
How have you been?

15
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,610
Commander, why did you suddenly visit me today?

16
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,220
It's a return visit.

17
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:10,890
Leave.

18
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,940
-Yes. -Yes.

19
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,100
Your place is very unique.

20
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,540
It's colourful.

21
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,240
I'm here to pay you a return visit.

22
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,680
There's someone else here.

23
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,350
I'm Sun Sanxuan.

24
00:03:39,110 --> 00:03:41,040
The head of the Gold Touching Sect.

25
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:44,750
Sorry for not recognizing you at first.

26
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,610
It seems you know the Penta-sect well.

27
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,400
I have always admired the Penta-sect.

28
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,180
So I've been paying attention to your news.

29
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:02,080
I know a little about each of you guys

30
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,490
and your tactics.

31
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,060
Then I wonder whether you know

32
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,460
the news about my father.

33
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,339
Ding Yuanshan.

34
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:20,240
His style name is Gu Feng.

35
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,550
His ancestral home is at Bozhou, Anhui.

36
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,010
He was born in the sixth year during the reign of Guangxu.

37
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:27,280
He's the 27th Kunlun Heaven Official.

38
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,380
His name is derived from this poet.

39
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,200
"The long river flows to its end along with the birds."

40
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,590
"The sky is so far away that it's as high as the mountains."

41
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,950
Since the 24th year during the reign of Guangxu, he has been the Heaven Official till now.

42
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:39,080
You've said so much.

43
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,930
But where is my father now?

44
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,370
After the Grain in Ear in the 16th year of the Republic of China,

45
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,630
there has been no news about your father.

46
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,190
Speaking of this, it's quite strange.

47
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:58,950
Lord Ding

48
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:02,390
is such a big shot.

49
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,070
He disappeared

50
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,470
so suddenly.

51
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,410
He has been missing for a whole year.

52
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,080
Little Heaven Official,

53
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:18,020
is your father hiding in the Kunlun Mountains?

54
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,000
Doesn't the Ding Family guard

55
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
the Kunlun Mountains from generation to generation?

56
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,750
Haven't you thought about going to the Kunlun Mountains

57
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,590
to see if your father is here?

58
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:31,420
Today, you are not here to

59
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,520
discuss about my father, are you?

60
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,380
Isn't it better if I can help?

61
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm a rough man.

62
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,240
I just want to

63
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,380
make friends with you.

64
00:05:44,270 --> 00:05:47,000
I have tens of thousands of subordinates.

65
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,820
It's more convenient for me

66
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,690
than for you to look for someone.

67
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,590
Are you sure your purpose is to look for someone,

68
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,450
instead of the Kunlun Mountains?

69
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,300
The Kunlun Mountains is guarded by the Ding Family.

70
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,100
The Ding Family looks for it. I won't get involved.

71
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,490
I'm here to tell you something.

72
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,520
I'm honored to have got Her Ladyship's appreciation.

73
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,780
I'm going to take over the military affairs in Fujian soon.

74
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,070
Fujian.

75
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:19,880
The military affairs in Fujian.

76
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,950
Guys, if you come to Fujian in the future,

77
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,020
feel free to ask me for help.

78
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,090
Thank you in advance, Commander.

79
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,060
Little Heaven Official,

80
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,770
your place is so big.

81
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:39,920
Do you need me to send a few men

82
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,220
to help you?

83
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,960
It's so convenient to have them to do errands.

84
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,409
To be a member of the martial artists community,

85
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:50,500
you need a few buddies to help you.

86
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:55,159
You don't need to worry about that.

87
00:06:55,159 --> 00:06:57,760
The Penta-sect can last for hundreds of years.

88
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:58,940
We can handle

89
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,790
our own affairs.

90
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,710
Commander.

91
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,550
Please.

92
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,950
He is bluffing.

93
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,480
Is that the Penta-sect's signal flare?

94
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:13,360
Commander.

95
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,250
Look at that.

96
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:18,100
It's launched from the headquarters.

97
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:27,050
As the commander said,

98
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,650
to be a member of the martial artists community,

99
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,130
there's no one who doesn't have a few buddies for help.

100
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,679
Sorry to bother you.

101
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:40,809
Signal flare.

102
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:42,909
Over there.

103
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,740
It's the bell tower. It's Yunqi.

104
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,610
Something must have happened to him. He's asking for help.

105
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,740
Where are you going?

106
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,950
I'm going to help him.

107
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,490
Master.

108
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,010
Master.

109
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,270
Don't go.

110
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:07,040
That's the Exploring Fire of the Gold Touching Sect.

111
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,310
He's asking whether there are buddies around him.

112
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,910
It's usually used to scare or threaten people.

113
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:15,980
But I saw the signal flare of our Mound-digging Sect.

114
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,580
I asked someone to launch it.

115
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,060
The Gold Touching Sect is protesting.

116
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,700
We can't just sit and watch.

117
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:23,120
It's a kind of support.

118
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,160
Master, there is a purple one among them.

119
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,560
Whose signal flare is it?

120
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,490
Signal flares from several directions exploded in turns,

121
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,910
and the sky is so bright.

122
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:42,320
Maybe a few beams of light overlapped each other,

123
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,000
which made it look purple.

124
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,490
I didn't expect that the Gold Touching Sect

125
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,690
had so many members hiding in Shanghai.

126
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,980
Xuewen,

127
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,450
let's also launch a few signal flares

128
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:56,180
to boost the momentum for the Gold Touching Sect.

129
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:03,480
My dear fellow apprentice,

130
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,080
ask our buddies to stand on the 16 stars stably.

131
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,210
Use the tactics of Dragon in the Sky .

132
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,050
Yes.

133
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:47,880
When is it finished?

134
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,800
Let's leave here.

135
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:03,500
The 16 stars of the Mound-digging Sect.

136
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,810
Yunqi, you're amazing.

137
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,700
All your speculations are right.

138
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,960
How did you know Commander Hu would come?

139
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,080
Xue Dingfeng went to work for Commander Hu.

140
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:16,010
He would definitely tell him about the place we live.

141
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,390
Your speculation is right.

142
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:20,810
We managed to scare the fat man this time.

143
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:23,210
He can't figure out how many people we have.

144
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,170
Yunqi.

145
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,520
You know what?

146
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,280
Zhou Qiuhai

147
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,170
is kind of a righteous man.

148
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:33,390
This time, he even helped us to boost the momentum.

149
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:37,720
Yunqi.

150
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,340
Is there something you didn't tell me?

151
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:43,360
What is it?

152
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:44,910
Just now,

153
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,970
I saw a purple signal flare.

154
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,090
Purple?

155
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,600
Mountain-moving Sect's signal flare.

156
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:56,590
Really? Why didn't I notice it?

157
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,120
Could you see it so clearly in broad daylight?

158
00:11:59,150 --> 00:11:59,740
You...

159
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,790
Young Master. Brother.

160
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:01,420
Did you see that?

161
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,560
Someone set off fireworks just now. It was so beautiful.

162
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,420
They were set off by your brother.

163
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,760
No, no.

164
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,790
Brother, why are you so annoying?

165
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,420
Why didn't you invite me for such a fun thing?

166
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,550
Next time, okay?

167
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:14,770
Don't wait till next time.

168
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,120
Give me one to have fun now.

169
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,330
I don't have any now.

170
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,380
Give it to me.

171
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,730
Go on searching for it.

172
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,530
-Next time. -Where are you hiding it?

173
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,060
I really don't have any now.

174
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:32,030
Madam, you saw it, right?

175
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:35,060
It was the Exploring Fire of the Gold Touching Sect.

176
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,320
I saw it.

177
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,430
Fatty Hu went to see Yunqi.

178
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,680
What should we do?

179
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,390
I think it'll be all right.

180
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,080
Yunqi's idea is good.

181
00:12:48,750 --> 00:12:49,460
Fatty Hu can't figure out

182
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,980
how many people we have.

183
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,490
He won't take actions recklessly.

184
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,020
However...

185
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,880
What are you worried about?

186
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,100
The buddy I've planted in the bell tower

187
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,040
launched our signal flare.

188
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:10,420
Don't worry. Fatty Hu doesn't know him.

189
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,190
Zhou Qiuhai knows him.

190
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:17,900
I hope he didn't see it.

191
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,700
Say it again.

192
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:37,930
The driver said to pass a message to the person in charge.

193
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,570
"The Opening Chapter is still in the shade of pine trees."

194
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,370
"Which part of the Book of Nanhua are you reading?"

195
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:46,790
Master Jiu.

196
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,640
Tell everyone to be on guard.

197
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,580
Cui Yi, follow me to the gate.

198
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,460
Yes.

199
00:14:08,930 --> 00:14:11,130
The person looking for you is in the car.

200
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,100
Inform Yunqi.

201
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:26,270
Yes.

202
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,300
Young master,

203
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:43,360
do you think there will be some more fireworks tonight?

204
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,590
It's better not.

205
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:47,060
Why?

206
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:53,650
Sorry, sir. I'm late.

207
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:55,540
No, we didn't call a rickshaw.

208
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,070
We just came down for a walk.

209
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,250
I called it.

210
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:01,970
Let's go.

211
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,760
Young Master, where are we going?

212
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:22,970
[Zhu's Wonton]

213
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,570
Don't talk.

214
00:15:58,210 --> 00:16:00,140
Little Heaven Official, it happened so suddenly.

215
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,730
There are many spies around the downstairs of your home.

216
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,460
So I have to come to pick you up.

217
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,350
Got it.

218
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,870
Don't you want to ask about the reason?

219
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,470
I'm waiting for you to say it.

220
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,630
The Heaven Official has come.

221
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:13,750
What?

222
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,650
Your father asked me to pick you up at once.

223
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,190
Hurry.

224
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:58,430
Brother.

225
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,630
Let's go.

226
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:14,310
Father.

227
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,089
Father.

228
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:25,900
Yunqi.

229
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,750
Father, what's wrong with you?

230
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,670
Father, let me see your wound.

231
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:43,540
I was seriously injured a few months ago.

232
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,930
It's a miracle that

233
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,450
I can survive till now.

234
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:50,090
Father.

235
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,230
I couldn't find you when I came back.

236
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,910
I asked Sanxuan but he didn't have your news.

237
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,110
I even posted a notice on the newspaper.

238
00:17:58,110 --> 00:17:59,120
Did you see it?

239
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:00,930
No.

240
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:05,250
I went to Chongming Island after I got injured.

241
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,500
I didn't know any news about here.

242
00:18:13,070 --> 00:18:15,270
Seeing that my injury is getting worse,

243
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,320
I struggled to come back

244
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,000
as I wanted to see you.

245
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,500
Father, you will be fine.

246
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,040
I'll cure your wound.

247
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:28,520
Silly boy.

248
00:18:30,030 --> 00:18:32,340
I know my own condition.

249
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,580
Come on.

250
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,990
Let me take a good look at you.

251
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,460
You've grown up and become stronger.

252
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,450
How is it going in the club?

253
00:18:57,710 --> 00:18:58,720
As you ordered,

254
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,440
it's not closed and is open as usual.

255
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,700
Hei Tou is watching over it. Don't worry.

256
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,650
What about the situation in the surroundings?

257
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:08,590
We've arranged informants in all the seven streets around it.

258
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,650
We've also arranged some buddies in the two streets

259
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,240
around the front and back doors.

260
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,040
Inside the yard and the building,

261
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,500
we've dispatched as many men there as we can.

262
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:17,530
Distribute the Gold Touching Sect's signal flares

263
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,880
to all our buddies.

264
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,570
If there's anything wrong and they can't handle it,

265
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,520
launch a signal flare to ask for help.

266
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:24,980
Yes.

267
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:43,600
Don't just stand there.

268
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,170
Go to sleep.

269
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:46,980
Sister,

270
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,820
what do you think I can do?

271
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,640
Take a good rest,

272
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,690
and wait.

273
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:58,480
Sister.

274
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:00,500
If we really have to put up a desperate fight,

275
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,630
count me in.

276
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,600
To put up a desperate fight,

277
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,170
it's not what a little kid like you should do.

278
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,610
Go to sleep.

279
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:14,230
Go.

280
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,590
Father.

281
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,150
Does the Kunlun Mountains really exist?

282
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,160
Of course.

283
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,550
The wealth which the Penta-sect

284
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,730
has accumulated for hundreds of years

285
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,870
is all hidden in the Kunlun Mountains.

286
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:21,050
It's guarded by each generation's Heaven Official.

287
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:25,380
But since the 20th Heaven Official

288
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,440
died of a sudden illness when he was out,

289
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,240
and as his son was only six years old,

290
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:37,390
the secret of Kunlun Mountains has been lost.

291
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:41,930
After this secret was lost,

292
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:45,200
from the 21st Heaven Official to me,

293
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:49,190
we've been trying to find it.

294
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,230
Unfortunately, I've failed to

295
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,860
find it all my life.

296
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,440
So I sent a telegram to ask you to come back.

297
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,700
Father, I don't want to find this secret.

298
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,720
I understand.

299
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,010
I hate the Penta-sect, too.

300
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:08,390
I hate it more than you do.

301
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:10,320
I even detest it.

302
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,230
The Kunlun Mountains is the basis of the Penta-sect.

303
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:19,810
Find the Kunlun Mountains and give all the treasures inside

304
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,530
to those in need.

305
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,830
Then disband the Penta-sect.

306
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:30,010
It's my biggest wish all my life.

307
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:34,890
The reason why I'm still being the Heaven Official

308
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,670
is that I want to finish all these things.

309
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:45,850
Both money and power are not despicable.

310
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:49,250
It depends on who uses it,

311
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:50,800
and how to use it.

312
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,620
Father.

313
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:01,830
It turns out you've been thinking like this.

314
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,080
For the six years when you were in the UK,

315
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,640
I never stopped looking for it.

316
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:13,320
In the end,

317
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,710
I found some clues.

318
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,020
During this period,

319
00:23:18,270 --> 00:23:20,830
I got a provincial military governor's help.

320
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:25,960
It seemed that he always worried about the country and the people.

321
00:23:27,810 --> 00:23:29,070
You should know that

322
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:33,060
finding and opening the Kunlun Mountains

323
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:37,420
can't be done only by myself.

324
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,240
I was moved by him.

325
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,970
I decided to

326
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:46,620
open the Kunlun Mountains with him.

327
00:23:47,670 --> 00:23:48,970
In order to be safe,

328
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,910
I gave the Dragon Bone and the Dragon Sceptre

329
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,720
to Sun Sanxuan.

330
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:59,720
If I fail,

331
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,450
you can continue to do it.

332
00:24:05,310 --> 00:24:09,090
I didn't expect that military governor to be so cunning and cruel.

333
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:12,160
As soon as I found the entrance,

334
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,960
I discovered that it wasn't the Kunlun Mountains.

335
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:19,170
But he coveted the treasures inside the tomb

336
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:20,680
and ordered to blow it up.

337
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,760
I was badly injured in the explosion,

338

I'm tired.

Okay. Just sleep.

509
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:55,900
Sister,

510
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:58,040
it is said that burial under the ground brings peace to the deceased.

511
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,640
Why do we have to bury my father under the water?

512
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:04,000
The Penta-sect once lived on grave robbery,

513
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,210
so they didn't leave any corpses or bury them,

514
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,170
in case that they should meet

515
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:11,060
those wandering ghosts whose tombs were robbed,

516
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,280
and have conflicts.

517
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:14,420
Therefore,

518
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,210
he chose to be buried in water.

519
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:20,030
Where will my father drift to?

520
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,880
After the raft goes into the water,

521
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,190
the people on the shore who see him off

522
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,920
have to ignite the bamboo raft.

523
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:31,760
Dust to dust.

524
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,440
Soil to soil.

525
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:35,950
Let the dead rest in peace.

526
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:07,630
The dragon leaps out of the deep water.

527
00:40:16,830 --> 00:40:17,920
The raft.

528
00:40:40,350 --> 00:40:41,900
Father, where is my mother going?

529
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:43,290
When will she come back?

530
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,830
My mother also left in a raft.

531
00:41:18,150 --> 00:41:19,880
When the son is eight years old,

532
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:22,060
the wife of the Heaven Official

533
00:41:22,890 --> 00:41:25,820
has to drift down the river to return to the mountain.

534
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:28,710
But my mother got on the raft by herself.

535
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,420
She drank the Penta-sect Xiaoyao Beverage

536
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,920
before she got on the raft.

537
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,290
The Penta-sect Xiaoyao Beverage?

538
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,010
It's highly poisonous.

539
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,640
It has been the rule

540
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:56,480
of the Penta-sect for hundreds of years.

541
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,850
The Celestial Gate is open and he's returning there.

542
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:11,650
The Heaven Official rises to the sky by the Green Lotus Pedestal.

543
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:26,770
Yunqi.

544
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:31,100
He rides on a yellow crane with the seven stars falling.

545
00:42:31,270 --> 00:42:37,060
His giant golden body passes through the secular world.

546
00:42:42,570 --> 00:42:43,360
Yunqi.

547
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,210
Later,

548
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:47,640
you need to ignite the raft,

549
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:50,100
and send Master Ding's soul

550
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,470
back to the Celestial Mountain.

551
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:56,740
The flying dragon is in the sky.

552
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:04,990
Yunqi.

553
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:07,890
Send Master Ding away.

554
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:12,690
♫Toss the coin into the blind box♫

555
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:20,230
♫I won't tell which side is up♫

556
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:28,110
♫Fear of spoilers revealing the results♫

557
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:35,320
♫Fear of being vulnerable♫

558
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:42,750
♫Entanglement is the cocoon of confinement♫

559
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:45,140
The dragon rides on a tiger and crosses mountains.

560
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,770
♫Intuition is the direction of courage♫

561
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,690
His soul is in the middle of smoke.

562
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:55,740
♫Not that I don't miss you♫

563
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,560
If other ghosts dare to block the Heaven Official's road,

564
00:43:56,190 --> 00:43:59,770
♫But it's time to let go♫

565
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,760
he'll make you doomed eternally.

566
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:06,770
♫Not letting go will cause injury♫

567
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:04,970
Farewell to the Heaven Official.

568
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:16,750
♫Give me the strength to break free from the cocoon♫

569
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:24,220
♫Together we step towards the horizon for the sunset♫

570
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,190
♫No matter how much wind and sand I endure♫

571
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:33,330
♫To break the shackles of the net♫

572
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:38,860
♫Oh♫

573
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:47,580
♫I'll just spare a smile♫

574
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:54,860
Wu Shuang, lend me the Jingang Rope.
