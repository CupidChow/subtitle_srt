Did you figure out anything?

This is our purpose of coming here.

Have you chosen a room?

00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:08,590
Yes, we'll stay in this room.

What about you?

Do you want to live with me?

182
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:17,910
Wu Shuang,

183
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,660
I tied the hammock for you.

184
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:20,790

It's fun.

No, I'm afraid I'll fall down.

Yunqi, do you want some coffee?

190

if Auntie Hei has made the coffee.

194
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,030
Bring two cups to me and Yunqi.

195
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,710
I want sugar instead of milk.

Why do you all like

197

It's bitter.

199

My coffee is different. It's delicious.

Everyone is tired today.

207

I want to go to Yufeng Palace with Wu Shuang tomorrow.

208

I'll go with you.

209
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,680
No.

210
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,900
Yufeng Palace is too dangerous.

211
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,090
Wu Shuang is from Mound-digging after all.

212
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,020
I'll go with her.

You don't trust me?

215
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:30,440
It's not that I don't trust you.

216
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,580
I don't know what dangerous contraptions

217
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,310
there are in the Yufeng Palace.

218

I'm afraid I can't protect you.

219

If it's dangerous,

220
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,220
I really should go.

221
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,070
No matter what happens, let's face it together.

222

Besides, I've always been interested

in mechanical design.

224
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,190
Maybe I can help you.

225
00:12:47,110 --> 00:12:48,370
Interest is interest.

226
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,940
There are many dangerous traps in Yufeng Palace.

227
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,070
This is not a hobby.

228

So...

229
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:54,800
Be good.

230
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:56,610
It'll be better to stay here.

has been following us secretly.

241

Do they have weapons?

There are no signs of carrying guns.

245

What do you think, Yunqi?

250
00:14:12,290 --> 00:14:13,590
Since we don't know their identity,

251
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:16,110
it's useless no matter how you investigate it.

Not really.

It depends on whether you have asked the right person.

If you ask me,

255

Although the door and the frame

291

are wrapped with wood,

292
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,000
it's made of iron.

293

Wood is benevolence and metal is righteousness.

294
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:39,450
This is the Renyi (benevolence and righteousness) Gate of Mountain-moving Sect.

But I didn't know it was the palace gate of Mountain-moving Sect.

No wonder you asked me to follow you.

The contraptions of all sects of the Penta-sect

00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,130

314

Do you know how to break the Renyi Gate?

In the direction of the Five Elements,

321

metal represents west, and wood east.

322

In the etiquettes of the five elements,

wood is three, and metal is four.

00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:41,930
Although the subject trigram is heaven,

344
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,820
you can't force things by power.

345
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:47,690
This may be the principle of the Mountain-moving Sect.

346
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:01,880
Don't move.

347
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,190
Let me take another photo for you.

348
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:03,990
Brother.

349
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,810
Do you think it's a vacation?

350
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:08,810
Being so relaxed.

351
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,980
Why hasn't Yunqi come back yet?

352
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:15,790
Did something happen?

353
00:20:15,790 --> 00:20:16,850
What could happen?

354
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:18,650
So many dangers happened in the past,

355
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:20,110
and Yunqi was fine, right?

356
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,700
Don't worry and just wait.

357
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,570
Brother.

358
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,620
I'll go take a look.

359
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:36,920
No need.

360
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,980
There are many traps in this town.

361
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,700
If anything happens,

362
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:43,850
our agreement with Yunqi

363
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:45,110
will be broken.

364
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:47,560
Don't worry.

365
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,470
Yunqi is not a reckless person.

366
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,150
Besides,

367
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,580
people of the Mountain-moving Sect won't let their traps

368
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,420
hurt Yunqi.

369
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:56,840
Wu Shuang is still there.

370
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,700
It's okay.

371
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:25,680
These are

372
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,030
statues of the Penta-sect, right?

373
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:35,040
These five

374
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,320
are the statues of the ancestors of the Penta-sect.

375
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:41,930
The one in the middle is the ancestor of the Ding Family.

376
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:47,240
This is the statue of the Mountain-moving Sect.

377
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,350
Yunqi.

378
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:55,390
Why do you know everything?

379
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,730
I read it in a book when I was young.

380
00:21:57,810 --> 00:21:58,730
I didn't expect

381
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,350
the real thing would be so magnificent.

382
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,320
By the way,

383
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,280
this is your ancestor of Mound-digging.

384
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:32,120
I, Wu Shuang, here to pay respect to the ancestor.

385
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
Don't kneel down.

386
00:22:57,490 --> 00:22:58,200
Yunqi.

387
00:22:58,750 --> 00:22:59,170
I...

388
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,180
Did I cause trouble?

389
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:06,690
It seems

390
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:07,950
these five statues

391
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,480
should be running on track.

392
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,140
It should be fine.

393
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:13,780
Get up.

394
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:15,980
Can I really get up?

395
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,110
Yes.

396
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:20,630
Slowly.

397
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,430
What's wrong with the door of the shrine?

398
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,240
There are five passages in the Yufeng Palace.

399
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,040
They symbolize the Penta-sect.

400
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,730
Among them,

401
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,960
only the ones of Mountain-moving and Heaven Official can reach the gate of the shrine.

402
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,470
You just worshiped your ancestor

403
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:49,730
and triggered the contraption.

404
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:51,460
That's why the door was closed.

405
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:53,790
What's behind the door?

406
00:23:55,450 --> 00:23:56,580
It's what I want.

407
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:01,790
Did I cause you trouble?

408
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:03,250
No.

409
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,150
As long as we don't make any mistakes afterwards,

410
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,880
we will be able to open the gate.

411
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,100
Are you sure?

412
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,560
Yes.

413
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:12,910
Wait, Yunqi.

414
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,220
Why are you...

415
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,800
Why are you so familiar with this place?

416
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:19,130
People of Mountain-moving Sect told me.

417
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,440
People of Mountain-moving Sect?

418
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,950
Did you get in touch with them?

419
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,750
Of course. Why else can I know these?

420
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:24,680
When did it happen?

421
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,680
Why didn't I know?

422
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,870
They are actually my...

423
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,300
I don't want to hear it.

424
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,670
Don't tell me anything.

425
00:24:32,990 --> 00:24:34,590
Why don't you want to listen?

426
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,180
It's fine that you know it.

427
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,200
Anyway, don't tell me anything.

428
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,950
Let's check how to deal with the door.

429
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,000
Okay.

430
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:03,320
Is this Dragon-Breaking Stone?

431
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:03,990
No.

432
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,380
This is the Mandarin Duck Nine-grid.

433
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,730
There are two layers inside and outside

434
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:09,190
to form the mandarin duck.

435
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,510
There are many changes in the nine-grid.

436
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:13,240
If the order is slightly wrong,

437
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
the door will be completely locked.

438
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:17,560
Do you know how to open it?

439
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,990
Jia, Zi, Wu are in the grid.

440
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:26,970
This is the fifth situation.

441
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,140
What's going on?

442
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,400
I'll leave my life to you.

443
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:10,890
It's up to you.

444
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:13,140
I was careless.

445
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:15,760
I forgot that you triggered the contraption.

446
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,160
This should be a warning.

447
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,750
What contraptions did you Mound-digging use before?

448
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,480
Just our own contraptions.

449
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:26,850
We didn't design many contraptions.

450
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,450
So sometimes Master

451
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:31,300
asks us to learn the contraptions of other sects.

452
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,830
The Mandarin Duck Nine-grid, right?

453
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:37,060
Stop making fun of my master.

454
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:40,330
This is a trap to protect the treasures in the headquarters of Mountain-moving Sect.

455
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:41,930
How could my master crack it?

456
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,040
It's good enough

457
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,210
to know the name.

458
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,390
Actually, your master

459
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:49,050
shouldn't even know the name.

460
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,420
That's why my master is amazing.

461
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,350
Focus. Don't slack off.

462
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:55,540
Focus.

463
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:01,540
The more concentrated I am, the easier I'll make mistakes.

464
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,340
Why?

465
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:57,320
The last one.

466
00:27:58,870 --> 00:27:59,870
It should be here.

467
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,670
Here.

468
00:29:38,830 --> 00:29:39,800
Slow down.

469
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,740
Slow down.

470
00:29:43,870 --> 00:29:44,580
Be careful.

471
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:08,780
Here.

472
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,500
Master Mountain Mover.

473
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,740
Ding Yunqi, descendant of the Ding Family,

474
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,870
is here to visit you.

475
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:17,230
Don't touch it!

476
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,040
Why didn't they shoot?

477
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,770
This should be just a warning.

478
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:18,490
[Book of Ban]

479
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,830
This is it.

480
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:37,090
Where are you going?

481
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,780
There are things

482
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:41,590
I shouldn't know.

483
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,290
Come here.

484
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,700
I hide nothing from you.

485
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,810
Don't tell me anything.

486
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,690
I'll stay here

487
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,270
and keep you company.

488
00:34:00,950 --> 00:34:02,410
I'll do some reading then.

489
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,080
Aren't you taking it with you?

490
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:07,710
How can you take away

491
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:09,440
others' stuff casually?

492
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:10,889
I'll read it here.

00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:49,680
♫It's so nice to have you♫

514
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,780
-I have to check. -I have to check.

515
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,610
Great minds think alike.

516
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:31,440
What are you doing?

517
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,660
It's been the whole morning.

518
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,190
They haven't come back yet.

519
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:36,680
No.

520
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:37,930
I have to go check.

521
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,490
What if something happened?

522
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,890
Okay, let's go together.

523
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,520
Is it so comfortable?

524
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,580
Why don't we leave?

525
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,850
So handsome.

526
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:34,300
I know.

527
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,010
Not only handsome,

528
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,280
but also smart.

529
00:37:41,990 --> 00:37:42,790
I agree, too.

530
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,210
Wu Shuang.

531
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:50,470
Do you know

532
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,610
why no one

533
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:55,590
can find the Kunlun Mountains all these years?

534
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:02,820
Then...

535
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,250
Can you find it?

536
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,950
At least I know how to find it now.

537
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:11,390
Although there are many

538
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,590
unreasonable rules in the Penta-sect.

539
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:15,000
I should say...

540
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,550
Some tricks

541
00:38:17,650 --> 00:38:18,980
are quite interesting.

542
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:21,830
Let's go.

543
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:22,960
Let's go out first.

544
00:38:30,410 --> 00:38:31,070
Do you think

545
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:33,140
it's better to close the door?

546
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,440
Of course.

547
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,000
In my opinion,

548
00:38:36,170 --> 00:38:38,030
we should close all the doors here

549
00:38:38,390 --> 00:38:40,240
and disrupt all the routes.

550
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,300
Then no one can come in again.

551
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,060
What are you going to do?

552

Brother.

569
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,950
It's our young master and Ms. Wu Shuang.

570
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,900
It's easy to tell

571
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:31,710
Ms. Wu Shuang's symbolic laugh.

572
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:32,820
They are fine.

573
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,780
Since they are so happy,

574
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:38,990
we don't have to worry about them.

575
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:52,050
[Yufeng Palace]

576
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,120
Brother.

577
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,090
This is good.

578
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:48,480
They are so happy. Let's leave then.

579
00:41:48,650 --> 00:41:49,280
Let's go.

580
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:33,600
Yunqi.

581
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:35,070
This is so fun.

582
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,610
Let's do it again later.

583
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:38,760
We can't just fool around.

584
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,410
After you did that,

585
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,790
the passages were messed up.

586
00:43:41,790 --> 00:43:43,590
I don't know how to open the door.

587
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,980
Isn't that great?

588
00:43:47,090 --> 00:43:48,820
Are you so sure about my memory?

589
00:43:49,190 --> 00:43:50,910
If I forget the content of the book,

590
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:51,910
what should we do?

591
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,720
We won't look for the Kunlun Mountains then.

592
00:43:56,080 --> 00:43:57,210
Isn't that good?

593
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:05,590
You deliberately messed up the passages?

594
00:44:09,810 --> 00:44:10,440
Yes.

595
00:44:12,330 --> 00:44:15,390
You really don't want to find the Kunlun Mountains that much?

596
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:16,190
Really don't.

597
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,080
Why?

598
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:26,470
Once the Kunlun Mountains is found,

599
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:27,870
many things

600
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,590
will change.

601
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,560
By then,

602
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,080
we can't be like this.

603
00:44:41,180 --> 00:44:41,890
Yunqi.

604
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,340
I like the feeling now.

605
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,320
There is no conflict or interference,

606
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:52,440
only us two.

607
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:55,540
I like it, too.

608
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:59,110
Then,

609
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:01,630
can we keep it this way?
