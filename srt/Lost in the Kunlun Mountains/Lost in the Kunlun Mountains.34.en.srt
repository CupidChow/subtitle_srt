[Episode 34]

4
00:01:38,910 --> 00:01:40,380
The position where there was smoke.

5
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,840
The direction over there.

6
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:45,210
Split up. Be careful while getting close.

7
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,740
Ding Yunqi is very cunning.

8
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,280
You must be careful.

9
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,420
Don't be discovered by him.

10
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,259
Yes.

11
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:54,200
Bawang Xiejia.

12
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,590
What a great place!

13
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,470
Let's go.

14
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,720
Ding only discussed with me

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,240
how to lure out Tian Long.

16
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,140
Can you guys explain it to me in details?

17
00:02:17,630 --> 00:02:18,720
We have never known

18
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,190
the real identity of Tian Long.

19
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:20,950
However, I suspected

20
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,340
he might be a member of the Penta-sect.

21
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:23,470
But I didn't confirm it.

22
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,270
A member of the Penta-sect?

23
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:24,940
Yes.

24
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,450
How are his martial arts skills?

25
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,420
I don't know.

26
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,170
I only know this old man

27
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,770
can use hidden weapons well.

28
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,320
Let's set up

29
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,670
a trap for him.

30
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,440
We should be careful.

31
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,620
When I went to fetch something in the car yesterday,

32
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,600
I found someone had tampered with our car.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,329
Who had tampered with your car?

34
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,000
Tian Long.

35
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,680
He must be stalking us.

36
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:45,520
So,

37
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,329
keep pretending it.

38
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,350
Let's go.

39
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,290
Come on. Go.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,910
Master,

41
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,220
should we get ready for the action?

42
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:13,990
No hurry.

43
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,190
Let's take action

44
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:18,450
when they find the entrance.

45
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,620
It won't be too late.

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,890
However,

47
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,750
I still need to borrow something from him.

48
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,850
Master,

49
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,280
do you mean Wu Shuang?

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,410
Wu Shuang is devoted to Ding Yunqi now.

51
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,810
We can't find a breakthrough from her.

52
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:41,180
But not all the people around Ding Yunqi

53
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:46,170
are the same.

54
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:25,270
Fengling.

55
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,480
It's time to eat.

56
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,880
Coming.

57
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,550
You are not angry now?

58
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,120
I can't be angry with you.

59
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,490
That's great.

60
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,730
Eat something.

61
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,820
San Jin isn't here. I can only make this.

62
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:36,830
Just make do with it.

63
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:38,490
I'll learn more in the future.

64
00:05:42,670 --> 00:05:43,670
It's a little dry.

65
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:44,750
There's water.

66
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,270
Thank you.

67
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,340
Biao.

68
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,120
What are you doing?

69
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:47,600
Didn't you say your shoes were rubbing your feet?

70
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,659
I'll flatten out this position with a hammer.

71
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,190
Then it won't rub your foot.

72
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:10,660
He Biao.

73
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,560
Thank you

74
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,240
for being so nice to me all the time.

75
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,910
Why are you suddenly thanking me?

76
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:21,490
I'm not used to it.

77
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:25,330
When I finish, you can try them on.

78
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:30,900
Thank you. Have some water.

79
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,930
Drink it slowly.

80
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,340
I've finished it.

81
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:06,430
I don't know when everybody

82
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,190
will come back today.

83
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,850
Take it and play with it first.

84
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,630
I'm not a child anymore.

85
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:46,290
Fengling.

86
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,920
Have you drugged my drink?

87
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:56,790
Yes.

88
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,580
Fengling.

89
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,550
Sleep well.

90
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:05,780
Fengling.

[Reply at eight tonight.]

92
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:33,530
Reply at eight tonight.

93
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:35,000
Eight o'clock.

94
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:43,940
Miss Chu.

95
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:49,490
Have you got the answer you want?

96
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,640
Tian Long.

97
00:11:59,450 --> 00:12:02,090
You arrived much later than I thought.

98
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:05,700
It's our first meeting today.

99
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,720
You seem to know me well.

100
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,580
You knew I was coming to see you?

101
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,670
I don't know you well,

102
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:15,550
but I know Ding Yunqi and Luo Yunsong well.

103
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,800
They won't give you any chance.

104
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,310
Only I can give you

105
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,820
the chance you want.

106
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:27,120
In that case, I know you well, right?

107
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,640
However,

108
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm your foe who killed your father.

109
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,990
Are you still willing to cooperate with me?

110
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,850
Because I'm the same as you,

111
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,350
having no other opportunity now.

112
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:43,840
Then,

113
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,480
how can I believe

114
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:49,020
that you are sincere to cooperate with me?

115
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,140
Of course I am sincere to cooperate with you.

116
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,750
I know it very well.

117
00:12:55,430 --> 00:12:57,950
If it's Ding Yunqi who finds the Kunlun Mountains,

118
00:12:57,950 --> 00:13:00,130
he will never give it to Her Ladyship.

119
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,670
Then I won't be able to complete the mission.

120
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:05,300
I think you know that, too.

121
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:11,010
You have a point.

122
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:12,860
The part you want

123
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:15,330
is nothing to Her Ladyship.

124
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:16,760
So,

125
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,040
we have the basis of cooperation.

126
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:23,190
But you are worthless to me.

127
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,500
Besides, the soul pursuit order in your hand

128
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,310
is not valuable enough to help you negotiate with me.

129
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:30,370
I've got Her Ladyship to be my backer.

130
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:33,750
A man is innocent, but if he has a gem, he will be guilty.

131
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,960
You have great wealth

132
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,550
and you need protection.

133
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,910
Isn't this my bargaining chip?

134
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,140
As you saw,

135
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:45,290
I sent a telegram to Her Ladyship.

136
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,370
Besides,

137
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:49,090
I have a more important bargaining chip.

138
00:13:50,030 --> 00:13:51,240
What is it?

139
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,300
Luo Yunsong's,

140
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,070
Ding Yunqi's and Wu Shuang's

141
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,330
concern about me.

142
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,320
Miss Chu,

143
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,750
I admire you more and more.

144
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:23,790
They won't abandon me or leave me alone

145
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:24,630
in the end.

146
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,160
As long as they care about me,

147
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,750
I can get information,

148
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,010
and I can play my role.

149
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:32,280
For example,

150
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,490
I can give you an important piece of news now.

151
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,650
What is it?

152
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,000
Tell me.

153
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:47,480
What is it?

154
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,180
Before dawn today,

155
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:52,520
Ding Yunqi sent

156
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,540
his servant San Jin out of the mountain.

157
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,930
He also asked people of the Gold Touching Sect to escort him.

158
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,850
I guess

159
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:00,420
he must have gone to deliver an important oral message.

160
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:01,340
Besides,

161
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:02,770
Ding Yunqi, Wu Shuang,

162
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,230
my brother and Sun Sanxuan

163
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:06,210
went into the mountain early this morning.

164
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,670
They haven't come out yet.

165
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,150
I guess

166
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,540
he has found the Kunlun Mountains.

167
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,260
I sent a telegram to Her Ladyship just now.

168
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,860
It's also about this matter.

169
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,190
What can I do for you?

170
00:15:26,330 --> 00:15:27,290
I...

171
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,540
Brother.

172
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,840
Why is it from this direction?

173
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,370
Isn't that our encampment?

174
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,500
Why is it over there?

175
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:44,960
He finally showed up.

176
00:15:50,810 --> 00:15:52,340
Shall we go back for a check?

177
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,210
No.

178
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,380
Yunqi has said that...

179
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,390
no matter what happens,

180
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,820
we'll stick to the original plan.

181
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,740
In this case,

182
00:15:58,290 --> 00:15:59,620
we won't get separated.

183
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,020
Let's go.

184
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,030
No!

185
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:50,750
Tian Long!

186
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,010
Tian Long! Tian Long!

187
00:16:52,010 --> 00:16:53,270
He's just a subordinate of my brother.

188
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,110
He's insignificant. Let him go.

189
00:16:55,110 --> 00:16:56,710
He wanted to kill me just now.

190
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,480
Besides, since he is insignificant,

191
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,140
it doesn't matter to kill him.

192
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,130
No.

193
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,180
Please!

194
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:04,310
Please!

195
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:05,109
Okay. Come on.

196
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,250
Come on.

197
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,099
You should kill him.

198
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,490
Kill him

199
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:13,760
to show your sincerity in cooperating with me.

200
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,980
I can't kill people.

201
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,660
I can't. Let go of me!

202
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,839
Fengling.

203
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:20,569
If you don't do it, I'll die, too.

204
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,579
I told you

205
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,349
I'm willing to give my life to you.

206
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:28,339
You won't die. I won't let you die.

207
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,390
After you kill the first man,

208
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:32,240
it'll be easy to kill the second one. Come on.

209
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,210
Let me teach you.

210
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:35,180
Hold it up.

211
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:36,950
Higher.

212
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,920
I can't kill people. I can't.

213
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,770
Come on. Look at it.

214
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:58,990
He Biao.

215
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:01,050
Tian Long!

216
00:18:01,050 --> 00:18:03,190
He Biao! He Biao, are you alright?

217
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,410
He Biao!

218
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:06,130
Ding Yunqi.

219
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:08,070
You're finally here.

220
00:18:08,950 --> 00:18:10,210
Your target is me.

221
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,340
Let them go.

222
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:12,430
Come on!

223
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,770
It's Fengling who has lured Tian Long to our old encampment.

224
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,990
He Biao is injured, too.

225
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:31,080
Why did Fengling go there?

226
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,590
I don't know.

227
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:34,120
Lure him to Sanxuan's place as we've planned.

228
00:18:38,980 --> 00:18:39,780
Let's go.

229
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,110
Ding Yunqi.

230
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:13,790
Where did you go?

231
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,140
I didn't go anywhere.

232
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,740
I just wanted to lure you out.

233
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:19,930
Then what?

234
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:23,790
We both know that

235
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,550
the Kunlun Mountains is not far away.

236
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:26,940
Stop pretending it.

237
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,220
You want to kill me before you find

238
00:19:30,930 --> 00:19:32,190
the Kunlun Mountains?

239
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,960
No way!

240
00:19:39,290 --> 00:19:40,130
Let's go.

241
00:19:40,590 --> 00:19:41,720
Where are you going?

242
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,190
Someone is coming.

243
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,680
Tian Long, you've entered the formation.

244
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,830
So what?

245
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,250
You guys

246
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:40,770
are nothing to me.

247
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,510
Master.

248
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:49,530
Brother. Wu Shuang.

249
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:50,790
Are you alright?

250
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:51,580
I'm fine.

251
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,230
So he is Tian Long?

252
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,750
He's also Zhou Qiuhai.

253
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,250
What happened?

254
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:05,950
Didn't Zhou Qiuhai die in front of us?

255
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,880
He died on the spot among the smoke.

256
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,320
I don't know.

257
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:14,020
Maybe this method is not difficult for him.

258
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,900
Yunqi, let Sanxuan and I go to see

259
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,160
what happened to Biao.

260
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:18,600
Take care of her.

261
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,560
Thank you.

262
00:22:30,910 --> 00:22:33,390
Why can't I stop the bleeding?

263
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,090
Why?

264
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,310
Help!

265
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:38,550
Is anybody there? Save him!

266
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:41,010
Help!

267
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,190
Biao!

268
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,750
Biao, don't sleep.

269
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,590
Biao, wake up!

270
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:48,470
Biao!

271
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,810
Fengling, don't bother.

272
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,320
Let me see you more

273
00:22:56,570 --> 00:22:59,170
in case that I should forget you in my next life.

274
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:03,610
Fengling.

275
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,470
We've come this far.

276
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,160
That's enough.

277
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,720
Turn back.

278
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,660
Why were you so foolish?

279
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,550
You knew I drugged you.

280
00:23:22,550 --> 00:23:24,570
You knew everything.

281
00:23:24,990 --> 00:23:26,290
Why?

282
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:29,110
Why did you save me with your life?

283
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,090
Fengling.

284
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,820
I told you

285
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,510
I can give my life to you.

286
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:39,610
But...

287
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,850
Fengling, I don't want you to lose everything.

288
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,670
Before things get out of control,

289
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,730
turn back.

290
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:57,450
I... I can't turn back anymore.

291
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,260
Biao! Biao!

292
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,430
Wake up!

293
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:09,720
He Biao, wake up! He Biao!

294
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:11,970
He Biao, don't sleep!

295
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,710
He Biao, don't sleep!

296
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,690
He Biao, wake up! He Biao!

297
00:24:16,690 --> 00:24:19,840
He Biao! Wake up!

298
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,810
Why can't I stop the bleeding?

299
00:24:22,150 --> 00:24:23,120
Biao.

300
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:25,220
Brother.

301
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:26,690
Biao.

302
00:24:28,490 --> 00:24:29,420
What happened?

303
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,140
I... I...

304
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:33,150
I'm asking you!

305
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,250
Chief,

306
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,610
don't blame Fengling.

307
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,210
It has nothing to do with her.

308
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:44,680
Sanxuan.

309
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:47,510
Take her back to the encampment.

310
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,000
Let's go.

311
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,180
Let's go.

312
00:24:52,430 --> 00:24:53,100
Biao!

313
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:53,400
Let's go.

314
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,280
Biao.

315
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:55,120
He Biao!

316
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,250
I'm here. It's okay.

317
00:24:56,510 --> 00:24:57,440
Don't be afraid.

318
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:58,810
I'm here.

319
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,080
I'll take you back.

320
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,040
Let's go.

321
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,170
Come on.

322
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:28,260
Can you tell me now?

323
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,020
What happened?

324
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,160
Why did you go back to the old encampment?

325
00:25:39,010 --> 00:25:40,900
Stop crying, Chu Fengling!

326
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,050
Biao has become like this. Why?

327
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,880
I drugged him.

328
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:51,100
After I made him pass out,

329
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:55,140
I sent a telegram to Her Ladyship at the old encampment

330
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,820
to tell her our position,

331
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:01,560
and to inform her that Yunqi is going to find the Kunlun Mountains soon.

332
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,400
Then...

333
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,550
Then Tian Long came. And then...

334
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:07,480
Biao also came.

335
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,680
He thought Tian Long wanted to kill me.

336
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,280
He tried to save me.

337
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:16,760
He got injured because of me.

338
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,490
It's me.

339
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,370
He got injured because of me.

340
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,980
He thought Tian Long wanted to kill you.

341
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,090
Actually, he didn't.

342
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,890
Look at me.

343
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,530
Look at me!

344
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,100
What did you say to Tian Long?

345
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:45,620
You are still not telling me the truth, aren't you?

346
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,880
Do you want everyone to die in your hands?

347
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,030
I want to cooperate with him.

348
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,330
Enough?

349
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:54,350
All of you have isolated me.

350
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,200
You've never treated me as a member of your group.

351
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,600
You forced me to do it! You forced me to do it!

352
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,150
Say it again?

353
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,660
You forced me to do it!

354
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,810
Hit me!

355
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:08,210
Hit me! Hit me!

356
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,150
Brother.

357
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,080
How is he?

358
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,540
Excessive loss of blood.

359
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,750
The conditions are limited. I've tried my best.

360
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,890
Can he survive?

361
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,650
It depends on himself.

362
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,250
Even if he can survive,

363
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,670
he will be crippled.

364
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:36,920
Brother.

365
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
Brother.

366
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:39,980
Brother.

367
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,060
Look what you've done to him.

368
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,810
Wake him up.

369
00:28:57,450 --> 00:28:58,540
Wake Biao up.

370
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,140
Wake him up!

371
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,990
-Wake him up! -Brother.

372
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,290
Wake Biao up for me!

373
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,050
Brother.

374
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:06,100
-Wake him up. -Brother. Brother.

375
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,830
Wake him up! Wake him up!

376
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,090
Brother! Brother!

377
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:11,350
Calm down.

378
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,370
Biao!

379
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:15,130
Biao!

380
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,150
Biao, wake up!

381
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,490
I don't want anything.

382
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,420
As long as you can wake up,

383
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,520
I don't want anything, Biao.

384
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:24,330
Biao, wake up!

385
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,200
Biao!

386
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,530
He Biao really can't stand up.

387
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,840
All these evil things

388
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,030
have been done by my master.

389
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,010
Luo Jiutian,

390
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:25,730
He Biao,

391
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:27,790
Lao Beifeng

392
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:30,860
and my father

393
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:34,430
were all killed by him.

394
00:30:41,110 --> 00:30:42,450
I don't know how many people he has killed

395
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,910
for the Kunlun Mountains.

396
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:50,140
He's Tian Long now.

397
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:52,340
He's no longer your master.

398
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,380
I know

399
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,480
your feelings for your master

400
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,210
are like those for your father.

401
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:01,470
I understand how you feel.

402
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:09,080
Yunqi.

403
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,120
I don't know what else I can believe in now.

404
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,850
Believe in yourself,

405
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:18,820
and me.

406
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:23,900
I think it's quite funny.

407
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:27,640
For all these 20 years,

408
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:30,370
I've been living in

409
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:32,010
a plot and a lie.

410
00:31:35,790 --> 00:31:37,590
A lifetime lasts for a long time.

411
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:39,570
For the past,

412
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,540
you've had no choice,

413
00:31:42,590 --> 00:31:43,770
but for the future,

414
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,290
you can grasp it firmly.

415
00:31:47,590 --> 00:31:48,640
You can choose

416
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,970
whatever life you want.

417
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,340
Besides,

418
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,800
I'll always be with you.

419
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:38,570
[The army will arrive in three days. Protect yourself well and keep Yunqi under control.]

420
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,250
Yunqi.

421
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,700
Why did you ask me here?

422
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,760
I want to talk to you about the next plan.

423
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:09,940
Okay.

424
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,270
Ask everyone to join us.

425
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,360
I want to talk to you only.

426
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,270
Whatever you want to talk about,

427
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,730
I'll tell it to everybody.

428
00:35:16,870 --> 00:35:18,050
Why bother?

429
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,470
Yunqi.

430
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:28,060
That's because each of them

431
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,920
is my bargaining chip to negotiate with you.

432
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,380
Every word I say

433
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,310
will hurt them like a knife

434
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:36,640
stabbing their hearts,

435
00:35:37,030 --> 00:35:38,690
so I don't want them to be here.

436
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,260
Say it.

437
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,560
Her Ladyship wants the Kunlun mountains.

438
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,290
She already knows where we are.

439
00:35:58,570 --> 00:35:59,710
You have no choice.

440
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,390
Really?

441
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:04,370
The army will arrive in three days.

442
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,310
If you don't cooperate with me,

443
00:36:06,390 --> 00:36:07,860
everyone will die.

444
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:15,230
This is what you want.

445
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,200
I don't want to go this far.

446
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:22,390
That's why I need your cooperation with me.

447
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:24,110
Yunqi.

448
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,130
You said you don't trust Her Ladyship.

449
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:27,790
But in the current situation,

450
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,950
Her Ladyship is your best choice.

451
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,800
Who else can you choose?

452
00:36:32,430 --> 00:36:33,390
I can wait.

453
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:36,270
The army won't give you time to wait.

454
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:37,760
Yunqi.

455
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,900
This is the force of power.

456
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,790
Sacrifice everyone

457
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,480
in exchange for your contribution to Her Ladyship.

458
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,280
Is it worth it?

459
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,970
As long as you cooperate,

460
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:49,230
no one will sacrifice.

461
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,000
What will Her Ladyship give you?

462
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,200
Are you sure about what she can give you?

463
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:56,030
Is her promise to you

464
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:57,330
worth your trust?

465
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,470
I trust her.

466
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,030
Why?

467
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,600
Because the power Her Ladyship has

468
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,650
is huge.

469
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,380
What I want is just a tiny part of it,

470
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:10,020
and it's nothing to her.

471
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:12,620
Have you ever thought

472
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:15,420
she can take back what she has given you at any time?

473
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:18,500
Fengling.

474
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,680
You're a woman of the new era.

475
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:23,150
You are well-informed,

476
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,330
and knowledgeable.

477
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,720
You should understand

478
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,840
this kind of relationship built under shadow

479
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,510
won't last long. It's impossible to last long.

480
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:34,190
Do you think I don't know that?

481
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:35,840
Do you think Empress Wu Zetian

482
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,030
didn't know that Lai Junchen was a cruel official?

483
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:39,080
Do you think she didn't know

484
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,630
the descendants of the Li Family were innocent?

485
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:41,830
She knew everything.

486
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:44,240
But in order to maintain her domination,

487
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,640
she could take advantage of cruel officials and kill people.

488
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,090
Her Ladyship is not

489
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,980
someone who completely lives under the light.

490
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,530
She can accept shadow,

491
00:37:54,870 --> 00:37:56,720
as long as I'm useful enough.

492
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,210
Why do you compare yourself with someone like that?

493
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:06,790
Why are you so degenerate?

494
00:38:07,810 --> 00:38:08,690
Degenerate?

495
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,030
Then why don't you save me?

496
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,240
We've never given up.

497
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,300
Really?

498
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,940
It turns out isolation and monitoring

499
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,000
are considered as not giving up, huh?

500
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,520
What you're doing for Her Ladyship

501
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,990
are not decent things.

502
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,290
If you stay with Her Ladyship,

503
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:38,170
you'll only remind people around you that

504
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:40,020
Her Ladyship is a greedy woman.

505
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:43,250
Yes.

506
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:44,740
You're useful.

507
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:47,050
I also believe you are useful.

508
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:51,360
Her Ladyship will keep you by her side temporarily.

509
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,020
But have you ever thought that

510
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:56,030
she will never let you go in front of others?

511
00:38:56,790 --> 00:38:57,870
You will always

512
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,750
be a shadow

513
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,550
-living under others. -Enough!

514
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,410
Ding Yunqi.

515
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,890
I've heard enough of your lecture.

516
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:06,810
Since I've done it,

517
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,790
I won't regret or turn back.

518
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,320
Yes.

519
00:39:12,610 --> 00:39:13,490
Ding Yunqi.

520
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,050
I believe you can give up your own life

521
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,510
for the Kunlun Mountains.

522
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:22,330
But are you willing to let Wu Shuang die with you?

523
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,750
And my brother, Sun Sanxuan,

524
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,340
the buddies of the Gold Touching Sect and the Black Feather Team.

525
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:27,270
Can you also sacrifice

526
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,930
the lives of all these people?

527
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,520
I won't compromise.

528
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,830
You still have three days to think about it.

529
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,060
You heard it?

530
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:36,290
It's good that you heard it.

531
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:40,770
It was my fault.

532
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:45,900
Otherwise, it wouldn't have ended up like this.

533
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,420
Biao got injured because of me.

534
00:40:48,580 --> 00:40:50,440
We are all in danger because of me.

535
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,600
What do you want?

536
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,030
Just kill me.

537
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,270
Kill the sister whom you've brought up personally.

538
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,440
You have

539
00:40:57,440 --> 00:40:59,240
a righteous and kind-hearted new sister.

540
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,670
Don't get Wu Shuang involved in this.

541
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,270
It has nothing to do with her.

542
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,300
You can do whatever you want.

543
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,900
But if I were you,

544
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,370
I'd rather spent the time

545
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,000
persuading Ding Yunqi.

546
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:12,730
Now,

547
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,620
all our lives, including yours and mine

548
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,960
are in his hands.

549
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:17,560
Life or death

550
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,280
depends on his thought.

551
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:21,080
Fengling.

552
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:24,230
Don't you feel ashamed?

553
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,000
You threatened Ding Yunqi

554
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,300
with all our lives?

555
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:28,850
Yes.

556
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,490
I'm shameless.

557
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,350
But you will be grateful to me in the future.

558
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,230
Brother,

559
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,120
you should be on my side.

560
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:37,670
If you help Ding Yunqi protect the Kunlun Mountains,

561
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:38,980
what can you get?

562
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,910
Have you forgotten our past days?

563
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,870
No, I haven't.

564
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:44,060
Then help me.

565
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,560
What can I help you with?

566
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,640
Help Her Ladyship get the Kunlun Mountains.

567
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:50,610
Her Ladyship will give you a high official position,

568
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,210
and I will be Her Ladyship's right-hand woman.

569
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,150
By then, we will have great power.

570
00:41:55,650 --> 00:41:57,670
No one will bully us anymore.

571
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,180
People like Commander Hu

572
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,110
only deserve to bow to us.

573
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,370
Listen, Chu Fengling.

574
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,590
For the high position and good pay

575
00:42:03,590 --> 00:42:04,510
acquired by betraying friends and family,

576
00:42:04,510 --> 00:42:06,060
I don't like it or want it.

577
00:42:08,630 --> 00:42:09,490
Let me tell you.

578
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,030
I always wanted to climb up.

579
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,000
First, I did to for taking revenge.

580
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,350
Second, I did it for protecting you.

581
00:42:15,350 --> 00:42:18,280
But it's meaningless to talk about these things now.

582
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:19,500
It seems that

583
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,750
though I tried all my best to protect you well,

584
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:27,110
it's all my fault.

585
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,880
I won't let you do this again.

586
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,120
I won't.

587
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,600
Let's go.

588
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,740
Where are you going to lock me up?

589
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,320
Get inside.

590
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:00,670
Don't come out without my permission.

591
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:09,190
Brother.

592
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:14,690
Yunqi.

593
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,610
I heard your conversation with Fengling.

594
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,340
What's your plan now?

595
00:43:26,450 --> 00:43:27,510
Fengling is right.

596
00:43:27,580 --> 00:43:28,510
I have no choice.

597
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:31,780
I can bet my life on it,

598
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:33,840
but I can't bet everyone's life on it.

599
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,260
Absolutely not.

600
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:39,550
As members of the Gold Touching Sect,

601
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:40,810
we are not afraid of death.

602
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:41,570
Sanxuan,

603
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:43,210
I'm not a martial artist.

604
00:43:43,210 --> 00:43:46,870
I can't just value the brotherhood while thinking little of life.

605
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,130
What can you do?

606
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,670
Let the buddies of the Gold Touching Sect and the Black Feather Team

607
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,420
leave.

608
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:57,780
No way.

609
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,380
Yunqi.

610
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,440
My master treated me so well.

611
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,840
I can't leave before I take revenge for him.

612
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,650
Sanxuan,

613
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,300
Yunqi is right.

614
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,900
The Black Feather Team has nothing to do

615
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,700
with this at all from the beginning.

616
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,900
I agree to let them go.

617
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:16,930
Brother.

618
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,800
The buddies of the Gold Touching Sect are different from the Black Feather Team.

619
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:21,930
They can decide by themselves

620
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,260
whether to leave or not.

621
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:25,210
Okay.

622
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,560
It's settled then.

623
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,040
It's called freedom and democracy.

624
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,960
Right?

625
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:35,330
Now the problem is that

626
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:37,300
Tian Long is Zhou Qiuhai.

627
00:44:37,970 --> 00:44:40,430
His martial arts skills are unpredictable.

628
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,850
Yes, so we've been

629
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:45,310
very passive all the time.

630
00:44:47,130 --> 00:44:48,130
Since Zhou Qiuhai

631
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,200
wants the Kunlun Mountains so much,

632
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,200
he must know

633
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,560
the Penta-sect very well all these years.

634
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,190
It's the same for our formation.

635
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:56,500
Then our method will be useless.

636
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,500
Not necessarily.

637
00:44:57,670 --> 00:44:58,600
He knows us well.

638
00:44:58,930 --> 00:45:00,130
We know him well, too.

639
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:02,870
I think the original plan can proceed.

640
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:05,950
Yunqi, do you have an idea?

641
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,350
Now the problem is that

642
00:45:09,850 --> 00:45:11,870
Fengling suddenly sent a telegram to Her Ladyship.

643
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:13,130
I didn't expect that.

644
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,100
So we must eliminate Zhou Qiuhai

645
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:16,110
within three days,

646
00:45:16,110 --> 00:45:17,030
and then leave.

647
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:18,210
Three days.
