[Episode 4]

4
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,979
We have the dragon bone.

5
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:43,380
Ding Yunqi will surely come and scramble for it.

6
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,420
What if

7
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,420
he doesn't surrender,

8
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,360
and face us with a tough attitude as he did today?

9
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:50,660
Shoot him.

10
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,420
Shoot him.

11
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,700
Yes, shoot him.

12
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,180
Brother.

13
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,940
How could you say something

14
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,259
like that so easily?

15
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,420
It's a life.

16
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:17,620
It sounds too cruel to you indeed.

17
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:18,780
Brother.

18
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,820
The crueler thing is that

19
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,420
you said that so calmly.

20
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,010
Fengling, I...

21
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,860
know how you feel.

22
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,140
But that's also why

23
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:35,420
I sent you abroad to study.

24
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:39,170
I wanted you to stay away from this cruel environment.

25
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,400
It's not like that.

26
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,579
Brother.

27
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,300
There are many solutions to everything.

28
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,060
Yes.

29
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,740
You're right.

30
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,460
Sometimes,

31
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,940
the cruelest method

32
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,880
is the most effective and direct.

33
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,060
Otherwise,

34
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,380
there wouldn't have been endless wars.

35
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:59,040
I don't like a world like this.

36
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,380
We both don't like it.

37
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,260
No one likes it.

38
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,620
But it's the survival of the fittest.

39
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,700
What we can do

40
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:06,620
is trying our best to adapt to it.

41
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,660
Either be cruel

42
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,720
or be treated with a cruel way.

43
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:20,820
Get up.

44
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,260
Here we are.

45
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,579
My hair style.

46
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,579
Am I in...

47
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,540
Do you know me?

48
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:43,220
Am I in my dream?

49
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,940
Pour water.

50
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,740
Well...

51
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,100
Pour water? No need.

52
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,850
I'm awake.

53
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,020
Wu Shuang.

54
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,460
I haven't seen you for a long time.

55
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,460
How have you been?

56
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,790
Give me the dragon bone.

57
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:57,890
No problem.

58
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,300
No.

59
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,660
But for the dragon bone,

60
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,060
when I'm out, I...

61
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,420
Warrior Ding.

62
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,540
When I'm out,

63
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,020
I can't take it with me.

64
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:08,900
Right?

65
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:10,860
When I'm out, I can only...

66
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:13,070
I can only take the dragon whip with me.

67
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:18,880
You don't even bring money with you when you're out?

68
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:20,459
That's because you don't know me.

69
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,940
Why would someone like me bring money when I'm out?

70
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:24,620
It's enough to bring my face.

71
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:28,980
Warrior Ding, are you short of money?

72
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,220
Should I ask someone

73
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,480
to send you some money?

74
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,580
Do you think this is kidnapping?

75
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,659
Sure. What else?

76
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:39,590
Aren't you going to both get the money and assault me sexually?

77
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,840
Let me tell you. You scared me.

78
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,180
I thought someone else had robbed me.

79
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,260
It turns out to be you guys.

80
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,740
I'm very valuable, right?

81
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:46,700
Tell me.

82
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,380
Where is the dragon bone?

83
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,150
It's with my sister.

84
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:51,220
Your sister?

85
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,620
You have a sister?

86
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,980
Take us to get it.

87
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,960
My sister must have hidden it at home.

88
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,120
I couldn't find it.

89
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,580
My home is very big.

90
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,420
If you go,

91
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,540
I guess you won't find it

92
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,460
in less than 10 days.

93
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,390
Alright. I'll exchange you for it.

94
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:07,190
That's even more impossible.

95
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,280
Wu Shuang's kick made me so comfortable.

96
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,300
Really?

97
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:14,300
Wait, wait.

98
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,500
Let me finish first before you kick me.

99
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:20,300
My sister

100
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,340
is called Chu Fengling.

101
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:24,200
My brother is called Luo Yunsong.

102
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,020
They are biological siblings. Look.

103
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,740
Their surnames are not the same, but they're biological siblings.

104
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,540
Is that funny?

105
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:32,180
They were adopted by my father

106
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,490
over 20 years ago.

107
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,340
They worked under my father.

108
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,180
Later, my father died young.

109
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:39,070
So I started to work under them.

110
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:41,120
So just now, Warrior Ding asked me

111
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,100
why I didn't bring money with me when I went out.

112
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,300
Why?

113
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,290
They don't give me money.

114
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,940
They've been abusing me.

115
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:48,610
Wait.

116
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,750
Why does your sister want the dragon bone?

117
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:55,659
I don't know.

118
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,010
Brother.

119
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,520
How much do you know about the Kunlun Mountains?

120
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,260
I've heard of a legend about it.

121
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,380
Her Ladyship doesn't think it's a legend.

122
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,380
Her Ladyship said

123
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,220
only the Ding Family know where

124
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,620
the Kunlun Mountains is.

125
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,620
Ding Yuanshan is a member of the Ding Family.

126
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,940
So is Ding Yunqi.

127
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,660
Her Ladyship knows about this, too?

128
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,900
Her Ladyship asked me to tell you

129
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,110
Kunlun Mountains belongs to the country.

130
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,600
It should be owned by the government.

131
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,770
Ding Yuanshan and Ding Yunqi

132
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,300
had better sever the country,

133
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,700
and they won't be killed.

134
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,180
Her Ladyship also said...

135
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,300
Don't rush to tell me

136
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,580
what Her Ladyship said.

137
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,580
Let's not talk about contribution to the country.

138
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:43,820
Today, let's just

139
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,220
talk about ourselves.

140
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,390
Our parents passed away early.

141
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,659
I've fought in the war for so many years,

142
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,370
and suffered so much. Why?

143
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,659
Because I want you to live a better life.

144
00:06:56,659 --> 00:06:57,090
Brother.

145
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,700
Let me finish.

146
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,650
I sent you abroad

147
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,540
because I wanted you to broaden your horizon.

148
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,260
When you come back,

149
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:11,590
it's good if you can work for Her Ladyship.

150
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,100
But I think

151
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:14,650
what you should do

152
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,620
is to marry a good man,

153
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,270
have a few children and live a peaceful life.

154
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,700
That's boring.

155
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,840
Isn't it good to live a peaceful life?

156
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,560
That's an old-fashioned idea.

157
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,950
What era is it now?

158
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,530
Women can't live only for their family.

159
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:29,390
Her Ladyship...

160
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,480
Her Ladyship has her own career.

161
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:33,300
Her Ladyship is Her Ladyship. You are you.

162
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,150
Her Ladyship has her own life.

163
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,150
She wants everything.

164
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,200
But you are not.

165
00:07:37,409 --> 00:07:39,470
You just need to take good care of your family.

166
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:40,770
As for the...

167
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:43,460
Kunlun Mountains, Ding Yuanshan and Ding Yunqi,

168
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,720
which are irrelevant to you,

169
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,150
could you stay away from them?

170
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,480
Fengling, listen to me.

171
00:07:47,490 --> 00:07:48,500
Go on a trip abroad

172
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,200
for a distraction. Can you?

173
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,480
No way.

174
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,640
In your mind,

175
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,190
you still take me seriously.

176
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,170
But I'm nothing to them.

177
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,300
What can they exchange for me?

178
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,560
Exchange the dragon bone for me?

179
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,950
You've overestimated me.

180
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:10,890
Whether we can get the dragon bone back, we need to give it a try first.

181
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,030
Sir, if you can exchange me for the dragon bone,

182
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,080
I have to thank you.

183
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,210
I'll kneel down and kowtow to you. Why?

184
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,070
It's to prove that my life is still valuable.

185
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:19,830
Didn't you say you're valuable?

186
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:21,430
Now you've become a good-for-nothing after a while?

187
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,630
If you're so useless,

188
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,960
I'll just kill you.

189
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:26,300
Look at your

190
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,180
mighty image.

191
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,400
You really look like a hero.

192
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,580
I'm just a villain.

193
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,960
If the story is revealed out that

194
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,809
a hero killed a villain,

195
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,520
how disgraceful it'll be.

196
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,620
You just want the dragon bone.

197
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:36,590
My sister has the dragon bone.

198
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,059
How about this? Let me go back.

199
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,059
I have the ability to send a message.

200
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,679
Let me send a message for you.

201
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,809
Yunqi, what should we do?

202
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:45,970
Let him go.

203
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,060
Warrior Ding,

204
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,700
really, from now on,

205
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:52,090
we are friends.

206
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,850
You kicked me for a few times continually.

207
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,660
I've forgotten it. I'll pretend it never happened.

208
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,930
Yunqi, don't listen to him.

209
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:00,700
We need to give it try to see if we can get it back in exchange.

210
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,100
I'll figure out a way to get the dragon bone.

211
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,240
There's no need to use this approach.

212
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,270
Here's your gun.

213
00:09:11,870 --> 00:09:13,550
You're the only one who I admire.

214
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,810
Show respect to you.

215
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,120
You have a sense of morality.

216
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:21,420
You even tried to take his wife away today.

217
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,540
Are you unhappy?

218
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,890
I won't take his wife away, okay?

219
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,670
From now on, Wu Shuang

220
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:30,250
is Ding Yunqi's wife.

221
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,410
Are you satisfied?

222
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,220
Seal his mouth.

223
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:36,940
I'll seal it myself.

224
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:38,540
Yunqi.

225
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,220
Look at this despicable man.

226
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,730
Why do you care about morality for his sake?

227
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,410
I'm following my own principles,

228
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,250
not his.

229
00:09:44,670 --> 00:09:46,270
But according to rules of the martial artists community, he...

230
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:47,820
I'm not a member of the martial artists community.

231
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,530
Yunqi.

232
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,370
Brother.

233
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:54,160
Alright.

234
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,670
Master Ding told me to listen to you.

235
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:58,490
I have no right to say anything.

236
00:09:58,490 --> 00:09:59,830
I'm just giving you a suggestion.

237
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,840
If you think it's okay,

238
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,550
just do it.

239
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,570
If you think it's not okay, then don't do it.

240
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,700
I want to lock him up.

241
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:05,500
Okay.

242
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:06,470
Do as you said.

243
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:10,460
Forget it. Stop arguing.

244
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:12,120
Let me make a decision for you.

245
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,400
Well...

246
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:15,500
Just let me go.

247
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:16,880
Why?

248
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,610
You can't kill me even if you lock me up.

249
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,990
It'll be disgraceful if this news spreads out. Right?

250
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,000
You might as well let me go.

251
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,850
I won't say you kidnapped me.

252
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:23,480
Why?

253
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,260
I want dignity, too. It's also a disgrace for me.

254
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:31,880
You're so smart.

255
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,060
Why don't you do something decent?

256
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:34,940
Alright.

257
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,200
Next time,

258
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:36,960
well,

259
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:37,840
when I do something decent,

260
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,850
I will...

261
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,100
I'll ask you to come.

262
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,550
Let him go at once.

263
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:45,990
Get up.

264
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,760
Come here.

265
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,050
Harder.

266
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,280
Haven't you eaten yet? Harder!

267
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,450
My clothes.

268
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,210
Well, my clothes.

269
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:53,800
Hurry up.

270
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,170
Hurry up. My clothes.

271
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,430
-It's a suit. Do you know? -Here you are.

272
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,790
If you dare to hit me,

273
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,020
I'll get even with you guys one by one.

274
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:00,860
Got it?

275
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,620
How long has it been? I haven't eaten anything.

276
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,550
I haven't eaten.

277
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,640
Answer me!

278
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,180
My lord,

279
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,120
your coffee and Tush are ready.

280
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,020
Thank you.

281
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,090
Tush.

282
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:41,390
Brother.

283
00:11:41,810 --> 00:11:43,070
You call this Tush?

284
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,410
Or what?

285
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,510
Toast.

286
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,530
Toast, Tush.

287
00:11:48,690 --> 00:11:49,620
Almost the same.

288
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,180
Sit down and eat toast.

289
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:07,890
Is it delicious?

290
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:09,100
Yes.

291
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,000
I bought them specially for you.

292
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,280
Fengling.

293
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,360
Give me the dragon bone.

294
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,580
No.

295
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,390
I haven't figured out the words on it yet.

296
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,450
It's too dangerous for you to have it.

297
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:28,610
I'm not afraid of danger.

298
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,770
But I'm afraid.

299
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,020
Listen to me, and give it to me. Okay?

300
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,100
I won't give it to you. I want to help you.

301
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,280
You can't help me.

302
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:37,790
Let me tell you.

303
00:12:37,870 --> 00:12:39,550
Ding Yunqi is a member of the martial artists community.

304
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,680
He would do anything

305
00:12:40,690 --> 00:12:42,410
so as to get the dragon bone back.

306
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:43,670
I'm worried about you.

307
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,320
Brother, you're right.

308
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,030
We underestimated him.

309
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,890
We had a thorough plan,

310
00:12:51,150 --> 00:12:52,910
but he still found a flaw.

311
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,270
Ding Yunqi

312
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,200
is interesting.

313
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,270
I'll kill you all!

314
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,320
You can't go up, right?

315
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,280
I'm looking for a position where it's easiest for you to go up.

316
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,790
You're reluctant to admit it.

317
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,390
How did you know I would come?

318
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,190
It would be strange if you didn't come.

319
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,790
I told you not to come, but you insisted.

320
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,850
I was afraid that you might be stupid.

321
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,340
I was worried about you.

322
00:13:47,590 --> 00:13:49,100
If anything wrong happens to you,

323
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:50,760
what should I do to live alone?

324
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,820
I'm just kidding.

325
00:13:58,390 --> 00:13:59,480
If we keep talking like this,

326
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,280
we'll be discovered. Let's go.

327
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:02,930
Then you should go.

328
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,390
Ladies first.

329
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,710
No patrol.

330
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:25,180
Impossible.

331
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:27,470
I think something is wrong.

332
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,290
Since we're here,

333
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,380
nothing is wrong.

334
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:34,170
Let's go.

335
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:51,680
No.

336
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,280
Why is no one here?

337
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,840
I wonder which room that lady lives in.

338
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,530
Something is wrong.

339
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,660
Let's go. Go.

340
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,420
-Go. -Stop looking for it?

341
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,370
Stop it. Let's go.

342
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,490
Go, Wu Shuang. Leave me alone.

343
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,550
You want to leave? It's not that easy.

344
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,780
Yunqi, go!

345
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,960
Go, Wu Shuang!

346
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,960
Yunqi, wait for us to save you.

347
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:38,910
Let's go.

348
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,590
He Biao.

349
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:03,140
You've won in a despicable way.

350
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,470
Don't you feel ashamed?

351
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,060
The loser should feel ashamed.

352
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,670
Send the urgent news.

353
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,480
Tell all our buddies to come to Shanghai.

354
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,579
Okay. I'll go back and ask our master for help.

355
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:18,180
Let's meet at the bell tower.

356
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,140
Go.

357
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:42,700
I didn't expect

358
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,550
we would meet like this.

359
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,900
Really?

360
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,250
I thought this was what you wanted.

361
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,230
What do you want?

362
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,590
It's simple.

363
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,100
It's for the sake of your father.

364
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,710
It's impossible that my father is a grave robber.

365
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:00,970
That's not important.

366
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:03,660
What matters is that I want to catch him,

367
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,860
and then execute him.

368
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,680
That means there's nothing to talk about.

369
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:10,880
Here's what I think.

370
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,550
Biao.

371
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,270
Yes.

372
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:19,030
Send her back to her room.

373
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:19,960
No, brother.

374
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:20,920
Biao.

375
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,610
Send her back to her room.

376
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,900
Let's go, my lady.

377
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:40,030
My lady.

378
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:44,050
I'm not going. I'll wait for my brother here.

379
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:45,410
Okay.

380
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,560
Why do you only say "okay" to me

381
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,580
instead of "yes"?

382
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,170
Because you're not my boss.

383
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,850
What if my brother and I ask you

384
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:00,780
to make a choice between us one day?

385
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,510
Neither of you will give me a hard time.

386
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:11,950
Are you going to be so cruel?

387
00:19:11,950 --> 00:19:12,670
Yes.

388
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,120
Because some things

389
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,730
were done cruelly 20 years ago.

390
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,790
You are my enemy.

391
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:40,840
Explain it clearly.

392
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,190
My father,

393
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:43,910
my mother

394
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,180
and one of my sisters

395
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,920
were killed by Ding Yuanshan.

396
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,610
Impossible.

397
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,190
Twenty years ago, one day...

398
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,680
Mother!

399
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:17,720
Run! Run!

400
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,690
Sister!

401
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:30,910
Over there.

402
00:20:31,290 --> 00:20:32,090
Hurry.

403
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,060
We hid outside for many days.

404
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,930
I took Fengling home secretly.

405
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,190
The whole yard

406
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,350
had been burned to ashes.

407
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:57,660
Since then,

408
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,740
my father has never showed up again.

409
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:04,590
My father never kills women and children.

410
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:05,890
Stop quibbling.

411
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:10,150
My father is not a murderer.

412
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,270
I found this on my mother later.

413
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:23,950
Apart from the Ding Family,

414
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:24,840
tell me,

415
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:26,790
who else would use it?

416
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,110
Who?

417
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:30,080
Just this evidence?

418
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:32,690
That's enough.

419
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,640
So,

420
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:39,400
you've framed my father

421
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,760
for all these crimes.

422
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,490
I don't need to frame him.

423
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,390
Your father has done many evil deeds.

424
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:49,530
He did many bad things. He brought it upon himself.

425
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,930
He robbed a grave openly, and is wanted by the National Government.

426
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,740
I'm trying my best to arrest him. There's no problem.

427
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,550
You didn't see my father kill your family.

428
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,600
For the person who set the fire,

429
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,650
you also have no evidence to prove that

430
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,250
my father sent him to do that.

431
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:03,520
I know it's painful for you to lose your family.

432
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,230
But

433
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,910
please be rational.

434
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,690
Your enemy is not my father.

435
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:13,390
I'm telling you this today

436
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,330
because I want you to die while knowing the truth clearly.

437
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,880
If you can't figure it out,

438
00:22:18,010 --> 00:22:19,640
on your way to the Netherworld,

439
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,500
just complain about your father.

440
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,040
Have you ever thought that

441
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,360
if you've wronged my father,

442
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:28,660
you're letting the real murderer get away with it.

443
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:30,130
I know you'll tell me this,

444
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,260
but it's useless.

445
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,740
Wait for your father here.

446
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,180
What if he doesn't come?

447
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,820
I've been looking for him for 20 years.

448
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,260
I don't mind looking for him for another few years.

449
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:44,970
Besides,

450
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:48,250
your appearance was a surprise to me.

451
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,170
But it's good.

452
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:52,930
For the debt of three lives of our family,

453
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,130
your father can't

454
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,430
repay it only by himself.

455
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,840
Have you filled the tunnel?

456
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:20,920
Yes.

457
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,830
You'll be grounded for seven days.

458
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:27,200
One meal a day.

459
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,150
-Yes. -Yes.

460
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,400
Master.

461
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,450
Where did you go?

462
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:38,350
Master, Ding Yunqi was caught by Luo Yunsong.

463
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,570
Please save him.

464
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:43,220
Where is he?

465
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,360
Luo's Mansion.

466
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,240
Did he go there himself?

467
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:49,690
He wanted to get the dragon bone back.

468
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:52,150
Did you go there, too?

469
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,900
After all, I lost the dragon bone.

470
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,340
Master, please save him first.

471
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,370
Stand up first.

472
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:03,140
You all stand up.

473
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,220
-Thank you, Master. -Yes.

474
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,300
Don't worry.

475
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,160
Luo Yunsong

476
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:13,760
won't kill Ding Yunqi.

477
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,730
Why?

478
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,800
The person he wants is Ding Yuanshan.

479
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,150
Killing Ding Yunqi is meaningless to him.

480
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:23,750
But we have to save him first.

481
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,120
No hurry.

482
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,790
He'll only suffer from the beating.

483
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,170
After Ding Yuanshan comes out,

484
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,430
we'll save him

485
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,010
so that he can marry you.

486
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,700
Now,

487
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,780
go with them to be punished.

488
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,380
If you don't save him, I'll save him myself.

489
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,040
Listen to our master.

490
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,910
A flying moth darts into the fire.

491
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:51,440
Is it necessary to send one more person there?

492
00:24:55,630 --> 00:24:56,680
Master.

493
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:01,330
It's necessary to get even with him.

494
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,400
Luo Yunsong has gone too far.

495
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,630
I'll teach him a lesson.

496
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,180
Otherwise,

497
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,890
he would think I really run a private bank.

498
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,130
No hurry.

499
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,900
I have my own plan.

500
00:25:16,420 --> 00:25:17,300
But...

501
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:23,050
What should I do?

502
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,340
What are you laughing at?

503
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,400
What are you doing?

504
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:56,420
Let me through.

505
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,090
Why are you stopping me?

506
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:02,690
Why are you going there?

507
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,540
I'm going there

508
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,430
to slap Ding Yunqi's face.

509
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,270
Why do you want to slap his face?

510
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,520
You were caught by him tonight,

511
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,720
and got beaten again.

512
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:14,380
What? How?

513
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,640
What did you say?

514
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,190
I don't understand.

515
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:20,000
I just want to ask you

516
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,560
what you've told them.

517
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,840
I... I... I...

518
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,630
I... Who?

519
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:26,890
What did I tell them?

520
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,040
Did you tell them where the dragon bone is?

521
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,100
I don't know where the dragon bone is.

522
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:33,320
It seems good that

523
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,370
you know less.

524
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:37,090
Stay in your room for the next two days.

525
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,880
If we really have to exchange you for Ding Yunqi,

526
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,980
the director might not want to.

527
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,360
You...

528
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,930
Don't go out with a gun if you can't use it.

529
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:55,500
It's dangerous.

530
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:05,410
Ding Yunqi!

531
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:08,890
You really have

532
00:27:10,570 --> 00:27:11,450
a big mouth.

533
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,310
My lady,

534
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,250
are you sure you want to do this?

535
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,840
I can't care that much.

536
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:24,560
I can't let Ding Yunqi

537
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:26,020
die in my brother's hands.

538
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,110
My lady.

539
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,760
I can't sleep.

540
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,060
Drink with me.

541
00:28:14,370 --> 00:28:15,080
Sit.

542
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,950
Sit.

543
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,060
Drink with me.

544
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:25,580
No, I'm working.

545
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:17,640
Don't drink too much, my lady.

546
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:26,060
I...

547
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:27,450
don't want to go to Europe.

548
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,380
What should I do?

549
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,090
It's the director's decision. It's difficult to refuse it.

550
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,970
But I just don't want to go.

551
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,220
Pretend to be sick.

552
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,650
That's a good idea.

553
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,050
But what disease should I pretend to have?

554
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:46,980
Whatever.

555
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:50,410
If you don't get recovered within a week,

556
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,100
you can't go to Europe.

557
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,390
This is not wine, right?

558
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,270
Biao.

559
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,250
Auntie Hei.

560
00:30:38,090 --> 00:30:38,970
Gentlemen,

561
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:40,900
thanks for your hard work.

562
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,740
His Lordship and Lady Fengling

563
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,340
-have prepared tea and desserts for you. -Auntie Hei.

564
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,470
Come on.

565
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:45,730
Take a break.

566
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,710
-Come on. Come on. -Thanks, Auntie Hei.

567
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,880
-Thanks, Auntie Hei. -Have some desserts.

568
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,020
Thank His Lordship and Lady Fengling for us.

569
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,020
Help yourselves.

570
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,130
-Come on. -Eat.

571
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:54,970
Come on. Have some tea.

572
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:56,230
Come and have some tea.

573
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,460
Thanks for your hard work.

574
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:01,940
Come on. Have some tea.

575
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:03,120
It's delicious.

576
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,380
Come on. Have some tea.

577
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:06,480
Have some desserts.

578
00:31:07,070 --> 00:31:07,930
Are you asleep?

579
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:09,090
What's wrong?

580
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,100
Sir.

581
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,700
Sir.

582
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,150
Sir.

583
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,670
Who are you?

584
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:36,770
Why did you save me?

585
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,010
Someone asked me to do this.

586
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,430
Thank you.

587
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,880
Brother, you're amazing.

588
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,030
It was so dark,

589
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:12,920
but you memorized everything by just going for round.

590
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,530
No matter how dark it was, it was not as dark as the tomb.

591
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,330
Have you heard of the Gold Touching Sect?

592
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,660
The Gold Touching Sect.

593
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:20,320
If you can't even know the way,

594
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,910
how can you touch the gold?

595
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:24,560
Well,

596
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:26,490
is this road the closest to the pavilion?

597
00:32:26,490 --> 00:32:27,370
No.

598
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:29,850
This one.

599
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:31,290
This one is closer.

600
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:35,270
Even if we get close to the pavilion,

601
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:37,070
what about the police?

602
00:32:37,790 --> 00:32:39,050
They all have guns.

603
00:32:40,770 --> 00:32:41,480
Yes.

604
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,160
You're right.

605
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:44,730
We need to be quick.

606
00:32:45,090 --> 00:32:46,770
If a bullet hurts Yunqi,

607
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:48,200
we'll be in trouble.

608
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,050
There are about 10 policemen

609
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,310
around this pavilion.

610
00:32:58,370 --> 00:33:00,590
How can we kill them quietly?

611
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:02,850
Use the knockout drops?

612
00:33:04,110 --> 00:33:04,590
Yes.

613
00:33:06,430 --> 00:33:07,560
The knockout drops.

614
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:11,340
However,

615
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:13,230
how can we make them drink

616
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,750
the knockout drops willingly?

617
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:16,480
It's better to have a spy there.

618
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:17,310
Spy?

619
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:18,740
Right. A spy.

620
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:20,280
Why didn't I think of that?

621
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,430
Young Master.

622
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,440
You're back.

623
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:24,700
Are you okay?

624
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,500
I'm fine.

625
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,720
Yunqi.

626
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,180
How did you come back?

627
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,870
As I said,

628
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,600
the spy drugged the police.

629
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,980
Spy?

630
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,370
Young Master.

631
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:37,430
How come you have a spy in Luo's Mansion?

632
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:38,270
Who is it?

633
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,700
Someone who has surprised me.

634
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,360
To be exact,

635
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,950
she's not a spy.

636
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,060
Where is Wu Shuang?

637
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:55,450
Don't mention her.

638
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,520
Don't mention her.

639
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,840
I get angry whenever we mention her.

640
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,040
And Luo Jiutian, too.

641
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,650
We shouldn't have let go of him.

642
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,380
If we keep him here, he can be our bargaining chip.

643
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,020
I've told you

644
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,660
not to ask me about the martial artists community.

645
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,389
You're willing to listen to me?

646
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:11,860
Look.

647
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:12,790
Look.

648
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,300
It's not okay if the team

649
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,480
is without a leader.

650
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,929
We're not an organization.

651
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,630
My dream is to be a doctor.

652
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,889
I'm not interested in leading others.

653
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,250
Anyway, I'll listen to my young master.

654
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,139
Alright.

655
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,210
San Jin, come here.

656
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:29,460
Young Master.

657
00:34:35,429 --> 00:34:37,429
Find a place to live a peaceful life.

658
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:45,790
The situation is much more complicated than I thought.

659
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:48,360
Luo Yunsong wants to seek revenge.

660
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:51,429
He said my father had killed three members of his family,

661
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:53,190
and asked me to pay with my blood.

662
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:53,949
What?

663
00:34:56,050 --> 00:34:57,650
As to why I was saved tonight,

664
00:34:58,690 --> 00:35:00,290
I don't understand, either.

665
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:01,800
The person who saved me

666
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,480
asked me to meet in the morning.

667
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,950
I want to hear her ideas.

668
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:07,600
Who saved you?

669
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,290
Luo Yunsong's sister,

670
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,720
Chu Fengling.

671
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:37,370
Brother.

672
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,410
Did you let go of Ding Yunqi?

673
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,160
Brother, I...

674
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,600
Have you ever thought about how bad I would feel?

675
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,190
Why did you act against me?

676
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:47,660
Why?

677
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,620
Brother, I think

678
00:35:52,870 --> 00:35:55,600
you don't have to lock Ding Yunqi up.

679
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:57,070
I want to help you.

680
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:58,670
You're giving me a hard time.

681
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,530
Pack up and go to Tianjin.

682
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:03,410
The train departs at 10 o'clock.

683
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,460
Go to France next week.

684
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,050
No.

685
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,930
Tie her up.

686
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,950
Brother.
