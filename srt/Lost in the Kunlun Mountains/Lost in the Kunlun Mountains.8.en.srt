[Episode 8]

4
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,700
He Biao.

5
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:41,530
-He Biao. -Forget it.

6
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,740
Leave him alone.

7
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,979
Brother, sorry for the trouble.

8
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,259
Not at all.

9
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:04,240
Stop hitting him, Yunqi.

10
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,700
It's not He Biao's fault.

11
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,580
I understand what Mr. Ding means.

12
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,560
If He Biao doesn't get beaten up,

13
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,110
he won't be able to explain to Master when he's back.

14
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,390
Then hit harder.

15
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:21,200
Anyway, he's rough like a stubborn donkey. He will be fine.

16
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,329
Stop it.

17
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,550
Enough?

18
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:47,700
San Jin.

19
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,300
Make more dishes.

20
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,940
Okay, I'll go get ready.

21
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,390
I didn't expect

22
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,900
you to live in such a place.

23
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,430
The bell ringer

24
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,810
of Notre-Dame de Paris.

25
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:02,730
Romantic.

26
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,880
I have a home too.

27
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,180
Your brother won't let me go home.

28
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:08,620
So I had to come here.

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,840
Romantic?

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,200
Fengling, here.

31
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:14,920
Have some water.

32
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,300
Thank you.

33
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,090
Take a rest.

34
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:16,770
Okay.

35
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:26,800
Director.

36
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,560
Ding Yunqi

37
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:29,829
took Miss away.

38
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:35,460
How did Ding Yunqi know about this?

39
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,600
What are they doing together?

40
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,360
We tried so hard but we couldn't prevent this.

41
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,610
Miss is back?

42
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,520
I guess she went to Ding Yunqi's bell tower.

43
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:08,970
Change to plain clothes.

44
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,640
Shall we take our people?

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,360
Take 20 people to surround the bell tower.

46
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,750
If he dares to hurt Fengling one bit,

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,220
I'll chop him into pieces.

48
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:22,120
Ding Yunqi is not that kind of person.

49
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,330
You know what kind of person he is?

50
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,590
You know?

51
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,430
Now I understand.

52
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,890
Your big brother seemed to obey your arrangement,

53
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:34,510
but he secretly sent people

54
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,710
to follow me and arrest me.

55
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,860
Miss loves this.

56
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,950
Since you insisted on getting the dragon bone,

57
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,290
he had to send you to Europe.

58
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,730
He wanted to solve the problem with me when you were not around.

59
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:43,909
Yunqi.

60
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,140
For my sake,

61
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,570
don't fight with my brother, okay?

62
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:49,370
He

63
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,310
must have his reasons.

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,290
Can you two stop fighting behind my back?

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,470
I don't want anything to happen to my brother.

66
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,330
Can you do me this favor?

67
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,310
It's useless even if I say yes.

68
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,230
I said

69
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,950
I'm not the problem.

70
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,600
Trust me.

71
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,830
I will do my best to ensure your safety.

72
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,180
Miss Chu,

73
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,900
you didn't understand what I meant.

74
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:15,330
You can't make decisions for anyone

75
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,520
but yourself.

76
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,910
So, just leave it.

77
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,170
We'll take care of it ourselves.

78
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,110
I...

79
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:25,070
It's been a long night.

80
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:26,250
Take a rest.

81
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,180
Wu Shuang.

82
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:30,870
San Jin. Let's go out.

83
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,040
Two more people.

84
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:53,550
What if we don't have enough bedding for the night?

85
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,530
She won't stay here tonight.

86
00:05:57,450 --> 00:05:58,590
How do you know?

87
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,600
After a while,

88
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,750
Luo Yunsong will come to pick up Chu Fengling.

89
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier? I didn't bring a knife.

90
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,550
Don't worry, we won't fight today.

91
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,850
We'll see the siblings fight.

92
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:13,830
Yunqi.

93
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,810
Why did you hide her brother's revenge

94
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,150
from Fengling?

95
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,320
Chu Fengling doesn't know about this.

96
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,130
It was all Luo Yunsong's plan.

97
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,650
He was afraid that Chu Fengling would be worried and scared if she knew.

98
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:29,790
That's why he sent her to Europe.

99
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,860
So that he could fight you blatantly.

100
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:35,590
The siblings are not on the same page.

101
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:37,690
I can't tell Chu Fengling.

102
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,580
It's a bit difficult.

103
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,930
I'll go tell her.

104
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:43,150
No need.

105
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:45,540
Since Luo Yunsong didn't say anything,

106
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,100
we don't have to tell her.

107
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,900
After all,

108
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,250
this is a misunderstanding.

109
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,720
There's no need to have someone take it seriously.

110
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,790
I didn't expect Luo Yunsong to treat his sister so well.

111
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,440
Everyone has a human touch.

112
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,820
It depends on

113
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,460
who they use that touch on.

114
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,210
But to be honest,

115
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,060
Luo Yunsong's treatment to Luo Jiutian

116
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,740
is quite appropriate.

117
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:18,800
I miss my master.

118
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,820
Mound-digging is better.

119
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,560
The outside world is too complicated.

120
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,920
There are so many people in mound-digging.

121
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,810
I don't believe your relationship will be simple.

122
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,750
At least I'm familiar with them.

123
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,430
I know what they are like.

124
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,860
I wouldn't be so lost.

125
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:42,280
Luo Yunsong is here.

126
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,470
How did you know?

127
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,909
So many people appeared nearby.

128
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,210
They are obviously police in plain clothes.

129
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,340
You're right.

130
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,290
Let's go.

131
00:08:22,350 --> 00:08:23,480
Fengling is here, right?

132
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,710
Yes, she's having a rest.

133
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,260
Wu Shuang, go inform her.

134
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,220
You sent her to prepare the mechanism?

135
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,309
No need.

136
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,240
Although there are dozens of plain-clothes police around you,

137
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,419
it's still easy for me

138
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:42,720
to take you down.

139
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,900
You are always so confident.

140
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,550
I promised Fengling that

141
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:48,930
we won't fight.

142
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,110
I'm in a dilemma.

143
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:54,230
I sent Fengling abroad

144
00:08:54,650 --> 00:08:55,700
so that I could

145
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,840
settle things once and for all with you two.

146
00:08:58,510 --> 00:09:00,150
This is between men.

147
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,090
Why did you intercept Fengling?

148
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,220
What do you want?

149
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,110
I'm not interested in

150
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,410
the sibling thing between you two at all.

151
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,220
I just want the dragon bone back.

152
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,860
If Fengling

153
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,750
can buy some time

154
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:13,840
for the misunderstanding between you and my father,

155
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:15,270
I'll be quite grateful to her.

156
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,180
If Fengling knows what your father did,

157
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,780
she won't help you anymore.

158
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,380
Why didn't you tell her then?

159
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,940
Do you want to see if she is as stupid as you?

160
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,030
Aren't you stupid to do this?

161
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,370
I'm just wronged.

162
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:40,680
You're not wronged.

163
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,780
Do you dare to wait until the truth reveals itself?

164
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,040
I'd die for it.

165
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:48,070
Okay, then let's

166
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,500
try our best to find my father for now.

167
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,310
You don't need to remind me.

168
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,910
I've always been doing this.

169
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:55,670
When I find my father,

170
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,010
I'll let you know immediately.

171
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:58,230
I hope so.

172
00:09:58,990 --> 00:10:00,290
I hope when you meet,

173
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,100
you won't disappear together.

174
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,160
In that case,

175
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:07,390
shall we continue playing with Fengling

176
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,070
or follow our rhythm?

177
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,500
Up to you.

178
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:13,270
Please.

179
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,420
Let's go home.

180
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:40,570
No.

181
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,760
Let's talk at home.

182
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,650
Let's talk here.

183
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,620
I have nothing to hide.

184
00:10:47,830 --> 00:10:49,680
Why are you getting more and more troublesome as you age?

185
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:52,830
Let me ask you.

186
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:54,800
Why did you insist on sending me to Europe?

187
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,900
I'm your brother.

188
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:58,840
Everything I do is for your own good.

189
00:10:59,090 --> 00:11:00,310
Don't you understand?

190
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:06,230
Then why do you have to do something unsafe?

191
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:15,720
Let's talk back home.

192
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,370
Brother.

193
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,240
You are my only family.

194
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,560
You want me to live well.

195
00:11:27,310 --> 00:11:29,080
I also want you to live well.

196
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,230
But no matter what the reason is,

197
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,030
your forcing me like this

198
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,470
makes me sad.

199
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:39,150
I've tried to negotiate with you.

200
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,410
But did you listen to me?

201
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,010
I said I'm not going.

202
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,070
Why did you have to force me to go?

203
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,210
I was wrong.

204
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,770
I shouldn't have forced you.

205
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:55,830
I was wrong.

206
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,890
Don't be angry.

207
00:11:58,470 --> 00:11:59,570
Come home with me, okay?

208
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,590
I can go home with you,

209
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,400
but you have to promise me three things.

210
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,390
Otherwise, I'll stay here.

211
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,220
Go ahead.

212
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:16,080
First,

213
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,730
you can't obstruct my career

214
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,950
or restrict my personal freedom in any way.

215
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,210
OK. I can do that.

216
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,160
Second,

217
00:12:32,910 --> 00:12:35,010
Ding Yunqi will cooperate with me soon.

218
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:36,950
You must ensure his safety.

219
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:38,920
He's so capable.

220
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:41,230
I think he's going to be the one to protect me.

221
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,090
Okay, I promise.

222
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,210
Third,

223
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,470
return the dragon bone.

224
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,040
The dragon bone belongs to Yunqi.

225
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,010
It's a hot potato in your hands.

226
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,610
People want to steal it from you all the time.

227
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,370
If you return it to him, you'll be safe.

228
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,290
Am I right, brother?

229
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,690
Yes.

230
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:17,890
How about this?

231
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,240
Give me ten days.

232
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,710
Ten days later,

233
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,770
I'll return the dragon bone to Ding Yunqi.

234
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,310
Whatever.

235
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,610
He said yes.

236
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,380
Ten days.

237
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:32,850
It's a deal.

238
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:34,320
You'll return the dragon bone in ten days.

239
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,450
You agreed?

240
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:39,570
Yes.

241
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,430
Come back with me.

242
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:47,120
Let's go.

243
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:49,640
Let's go.

244
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,030
Wu Shuang.

245
00:13:56,910 --> 00:13:58,760
Don't forget to visit me when you're free.

246
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,040
Thank you, Yunqi.

247
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,680
Thank you, San Jin.

248
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,230
Thank you for taking me in.

249
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,580
I'm leaving.

250
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,890
Bye.

251
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,270
Let's hang out sometime.

252
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:18,290
If you want,

253
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,300
you can go back to your old house anytime.

254
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:22,240
At least, it's a place

255
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,750
like home.

256
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:27,280
Thank you.

257
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:36,940
Yunqi.

258
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,410
Luo Yunsong asked you to go back to live at home.

259
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,080
Are you going back?

260
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,040
Of course not.

261
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,890
That house is not in the concession.

262
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,740
It's easier for him to catch us.

263
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:48,110
But I really want to go home.

264
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,520
Get off and check.

265
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,830
What did we hit?

266
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,490
You little bastard!

267
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,460
Young Master! Young Master!

268
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,040
You scared me.

269
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,760
Young Master. Help me.

270
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,680
I thought I ran into a pregnant woman.

271
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,560
Why should I save you?

272
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:19,940
Young Master.

273
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,820
Come on. Stand up.

274
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:21,870
If you're alive, I'll hit you again.

275
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,920
-I'll make sure you die this time. -Don't run.

276
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:23,850
Master.

277
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,600
Stop!

278
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:25,820
-Master. -What? -Stop.

279
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,660
Stop! Stop!

280
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:27,330
Help me.

281
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:27,960
-How can I help you? -Stop there.

282
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,590
Stop!

283
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,490
I...

284
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,730
It's Young Master Tian.

285
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,450
You scared me.

286
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,380
I thought you were going to fight me on the street.

287
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:39,470
What are you doing?

288
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:41,030
The guy behind you.

289
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,550
What's wrong with him?

290
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,810
He stole our stuff.

291
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,240
Stole from you?

292
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,840
That's it?

293
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,390
Yes, Young Master Tian.

294
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:51,780
What is this?

295
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,620
You guys

296
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,000
taking out weapons on the road, making a scene.

297
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,470
No, no, no.

298
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:56,860
Holding a knife like you are going to kill someone.

299
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:58,080
Young Master Tian.

300
00:15:58,830 --> 00:15:59,710
I was wrong.

301
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,020
This package is not ours.

302
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,020
We made a mistake.

303
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,200
Mistake.

304
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:03,870
It was a mistake.

305
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,640
Sorry to disturb you, Young Master Jiutian.

306
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,060
Let's go.

307
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,400
What is this?

308
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,350
Thank you for saving me, Young Master. I'll pay you back someday.

309
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,700
Why someday? Make it today.

310
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,220
Taking out weapons on the road.

311
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,180
Let me see what this is.

312
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,880
Crude opium.

313
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:27,270
I...

314
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,400
You...

315
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,040
This is a big deal, you brat.

316
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,170
I was disrespectful.

317
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,140
Young Master,

318
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,650
I just want to make a living.

319
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:34,910
You...

320
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,510
Do you know what I do?

321
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,750
Young Master, if you let me go this time,

322
00:16:40,830 --> 00:16:41,970
I'll do everything I can to repay you.

323
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,790
You have a pretty face and physique.

324
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,310
Why would you be a thief?

325
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,410
I really just want to make a living.

326
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,050
Alright, get up.

327
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,240
Thank you, Young Master Tian.

328
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,440
You know me?

329
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,580
Everyone in Shanghai

330
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,630
knows your name.

331
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:03,220
Well...

332
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,369
I didn't expect to offend you today.

333
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,670
Cut the crap.

334
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:10,230
Do you like it yourself,

335
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:11,240
or

336
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,579
are you from Bagu Opium-robbing Party?

337
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:13,589
No.

338
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,770
I don't have any instructor.

339
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:17,329
I'm just an individual dealer.

340
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:18,880
Individual dealer?

341
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,280
You've stuck your chopsticks in their bowl.

342
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:23,040
Aren't you afraid that they'll chop your hands off?

343
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:24,339
Young Master Tian,

344
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:26,190
are you from Bagu Opium-robbing Party?

345
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:28,079
I can be,

346
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,550
or not be.

347
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,150
Now you are asking about me.

348
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,460
You...

349
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:36,100
This isn't the crude opium from Kolkata, is it?

350
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:38,030
The quality looks good.

351
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,960
What kind of opium is this?

352
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,510
Young Master Tian, you are really an expert.

353
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:43,240
This is the latest top-class opium.

354
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,470
If you are interested in this,

355
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,430
you can keep them as my gift to you.

356
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,490
No need.

357
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,170
I'm not interested in this.

358
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,350
It's bad for health.

359
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,190
Yes.

360
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,550
But

361
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,860
I'm quite interested in you.

362
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:00,710
Come, find a place.

363
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:01,430
Let's talk.

364
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:04,070
Why are you also lame?

365
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,500
Just like me?

366
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,590
Were you born with it?

367
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,570
I remember. You got bumped just now.

[Police Station]

369
00:18:13,230 --> 00:18:15,580
The Han Tomb in the Tianling Mountain was stolen.

370
00:18:19,110 --> 00:18:20,120
Although this tomb is not big,

371
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:21,210
it is indeed from the Han Dynasty.

Director.

373
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,560
Who is so bold

374
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,480
to commit such a crime at this time?

375
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:26,500
[This is an intended tomb raiding incident. The exhibit, the remains of explosives, have been brought back to the police station.]

376
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,200
He must be someone capable and bold.

377
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,780
Call the reporters from Shen Journal here.

378
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,760
I'm going to do an interview about the raiding of Han Tomb.

379
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,280
Yes.

380
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,880
Ding Yuanshan,

381
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,810
don't blame me.

382
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:51,240
If you don't come out,

383
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,040
I have to do something outrageous.

384
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,190
Let's see how long you can hide.

385
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,000
[Han Tomb in the Tianling Mountains was raided. Done by the wanted criminal Ding Yuanshan. Pictures of dragon bones are revealed.]

386
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,240
Shameless!

387
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,270
This secret is no longer inside Penta-sect.

388
00:19:17,110 --> 00:19:18,540
Now everyone in Shanghai knows that

389
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,220
Luo Yunsong has the dragon bone.

390
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,400
They are doing everything they can think of

391
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,500
to provoke my father.

392
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,320
Do you think

393
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,510
that it could be your father?

394
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,020
Impossible.

395
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,710
What if he thought

396
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,700
the Han Tomb has something to do with the Kunlun Mountains,

397
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:37,860
and he wanted to explore it?

398
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,850
Don't be angry. I didn't mean that.

399
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,860
I mean

400
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:45,750
it's such a hard time now.

401
00:19:46,170 --> 00:19:47,390
Who would raid the Han Tomb

402
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,150
at such a timing?

403
00:19:49,610 --> 00:19:51,460
There must be a reason.

404
00:19:58,560 --> 00:19:59,110
Okay.

405
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,410
Understood.

406
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,490

407
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:23,840
What's wrong?

408

I called you but you didn't answer.

409
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:30,140
I saw the newspaper.

410

[Wanted poster]

411
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,290
Her Ladyship saw it too.

412
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:35,690
What did she say?

413
00:20:36,530 --> 00:20:37,490
Her Ladyship asked

414
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,310
why it is targeted at Ding Yuanshan.

415
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,900
She also asked

416
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,880
if the dragon bone is something necessary

417
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,640
to open the Kunlun Mountains.

418
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,410

419

the characters on it?

420
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,940
Nothing will happen.

421
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,710
Because they won't.

422
00:20:55,470 --> 00:20:56,390
See for yourself.

423
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,160
Isn't the important part of the characters blocked?

424
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,170
How can you tell?

425
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:04,880
Brother.

426
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:06,890

I'm in trouble.

428
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:12,230
Enlighten me.

429
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:14,830
Her Ladyship,

and Zhou Qiuhai from Penta-sect will all be very angry.

433
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,490
Because you put a lie

434
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,420
and a secret on the newspaper at the same time.

435
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,860
I did it on purpose.

436
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:29,910
And then?

437
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:32,600
Now everyone knows you have the dragon bone.

438
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:33,770
It's troublesome.

439
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:35,120
Not at all.

440
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:37,010
There's no trouble.

441
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,740
Only Her Ladyship and Ding Yuanshan didn't know that

442
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,130
the dragon bone is in my hands.

443
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,430
Her Ladyship

444
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:44,690
doesn't want the dragon bone.

445
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,950
She only wants the Kunlun Mountains.

446
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,630
Only Ding Yuanshan wants the dragon bone.

447
00:21:47,970 --> 00:21:49,140
If he wants the dragon bone,

448
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:50,360
he can simply come to me.

449
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,040
Is this logic right?

450
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,520
This logic...

451
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,280
makes sense.

452
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,350
But Ding Yuanshan didn't show himself even when Yunqi posted it on newspaper.

453
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,410
How do you know he will come out this time?

454
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:03,170
I don't know.

455
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:04,890
That's why I want to try.

456
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,910
After all, this is the dragon bone.

457
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:15,310
Brother.

458
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,120
From now on,

459
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,680
anything related to the Kunlun Mountains

460
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,360
needs to be run by me first.

461
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,600
Where are you going?

462
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,450
Find Ding Yunqi.

463
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,040
Here.

464
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,130
How is it?

465
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,100
How is it inside?

466
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:21,790
It's a Han Tomb.

467
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,520
The level is quite low.

468
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:25,110
The stuff inside have been cleaned.

469
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:26,830
The locating technique is quite accurate.

470
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,640
The raiding hole goes straight to the main tomb.

471
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,120
No beating around the bush. He's a veteran.

472
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,560
But the hole was blown open.

473
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,080
Blown open?

474
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,440
So,

475
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,120
this was definitely not your father.

476
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,310
But this alone

477
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,240
is not enough to convince others.

478
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,670
Because outsiders can't understand

479
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,050
why people from Penta-sect don't use explosives

480
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:52,870
to raid tombs.

481
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:55,100
That's right.

482
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:03,160
Yunqi.

483
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,510
What did you find?

484
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:05,390
Isn't Dragon-seeking Locating

485
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,910
the specialty of your sect?

486
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:08,870
Expert, enlighten me.

487
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:11,530
OK.

488
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,980
The landscape of Tianling Mountain is very special.

489
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:17,860
Look.

490
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,840
The whole mountain is upside down.

491
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,350
But the tomb raiders

492
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:22,610
didn't notice that.

493
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,610
That's why they chose this location

494
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,340
to dig a hole.

495
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:26,810
If they didn't see it,

496
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,030
how could they locate the hole

497
00:24:28,070 --> 00:24:29,200
so precisely and dig the hole?

498
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,510
Didn't you say the location is accurate?

499
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,600
Yes.

500
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,410
They did spot precisely

501
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:35,440
the location of the suspicious tomb.

502
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,890
This is why the designer

503
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:39,110
of this tomb is smart.

504
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,460
Besides,

505
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:42,680
this tomb is just a subordinate tomb.

506
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,490
The real main tomb is not here.

507
00:24:48,730 --> 00:24:50,540
What is a suspicious tomb?

508
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:53,100
It's a fake tomb

509
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,860
to cover up the real tomb. A deceptive trick.

510
00:24:59,190 --> 00:24:59,820
So, Expert Wu Shuang,

511
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,290
please tell us

512
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:02,300
where the main tomb is?

513
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,250
Over there.

514
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,700
With the geomancy here,

515
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,680
plus the suspicious tomb at the transition of heaven and earth,

516
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,810
the tomb

517
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,110
can't be small.

518
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:22,960
Magistrate Li.

519
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,070
What's the name of the mountain over there?

520
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,030
Agent,

521
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,550
this is the famous Small Kunlun in Zhejiang.

522
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,040
Yunqi, what if it's a coincidence.

523
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:40,350
I don't know.

524
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,770
All the names

525
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,910
have an origin.

526
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,500
This...

527
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,230
This might be the Kunlun Mountains.

528
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,390
I must get this done.

529
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:53,530
Yunqi, will you help me or not?

530
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:54,670
No.

531
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,110
Wu Shuang.

532
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,610
This...

533
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,720
This is too difficult.

534
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:06,600
I've never done such a big thing.

535
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:08,400
I know.

536
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,880
Can you find out what explosives it is?

537
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:13,360
No problem.

538
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:21,950
Fengling has examined and found out that

539
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,030
the residuals of the explosives

540
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,000
were from the artillery used by the Army.

541
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:28,350
Explosives from a bomb?

542
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:30,330
It's an artillery.

543
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,670
What's the difference?

544
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,630
There are usually two types of ammunition in the army.

545
00:26:37,050 --> 00:26:38,730
One is artillery, the other is mountain gun.

546
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:40,660
They are both cannons,

547
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:41,920
but the difference is huge.

548
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,770
Artillery has a long shooting range and is powerful.

549
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,240
Unlike the ammunition used by normal Army.

550
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,470
In Shanghai's surroundings,

551
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:50,610
only Songjiang Army uses this kind of artillery.

552
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,880
Then what should we do next?

553
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:56,990
Chu Fengling said it's inconvenient for her to intervene in the army.

554
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,090
That's all she can do for us.

555
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:04,050
The outside world is really annoying.

556
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:06,400
When I was with Master,

557
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,630
I didn't need to worry about anything.

558
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:13,790

559
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,600
I miss Master.

560
00:27:17,030 --> 00:27:17,870
Then go see him.

561
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,660
Can you go back to Taiyi Private Bank and visit him with me?

562
00:27:25,430 --> 00:27:26,690
I'll pass.

563

Why?

564
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,180
Your master's opinion of my father

565
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:32,400
and his way of Penta-sect

566
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,280
is not my favorite.

567
00:27:33,530 --> 00:27:35,000
It's inevitable to talk about this when we meet.

568
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,350
I don't want us to be unhappy.

569
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,580
That's why you need more chances to connect.

570
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:41,040
Both of you are smart.

571
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,450
You will get along well.

572
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:48,070
You can't always be like this.

573
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:50,330
It's okay for now. Nothing wrong.

574
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,680
I just want to find my father.

575
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,810
I don't want to have grudges with him.

576
00:27:53,270 --> 00:27:54,490
What grudge?

577
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:56,510
The grudge between you is me.

578
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,420
Are you still thinking about the engagement?

579
00:28:02,810 --> 00:28:04,740
I didn't say anything. You brought it up.

580
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,050
That's what you meant.

581

Do you think I'm stupid?

You're always friendly.

But when I mention this,

584

it's like stepping on a cat's tail to you.

Don't even mention it.

Master, this is a gift from Yunqi.

He said he wants to greet you.

He has something urgent to attend to today so he can't come.

Yes.

one thing is for sure.

00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,280
Zhou Qiuhai.

686
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:22,790
At least

687
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,810
Sun Sanxuan.

688
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,280
Whatever.

689
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,000
Anyway, I think Wu Shuang can do it.

690
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:29,350
We'll see.

691
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,070
After all, she's familiar with it.

692
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,390
Okay, Wu Shuang it is.

693
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:41,820
Brother.

694
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,630
-Here. -It's okay.

695
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,590
Okay.

696
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,520
Where have you been?

697
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,360
I...

698
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,760
took a walk by the river

699
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:52,820
and thought about

700
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,420
what to do next.

701
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,020
Brother told me to think about

702
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:57,780
how would I like to live in the future.

703
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,800
Have you figured it out?

704
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:04,860
I was just thinking

705
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:06,600
after my leg was crippled,

706
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,030
I've become slower.

707
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:10,510
I've figured out

708
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:12,310
many things.

709
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,080
I need to walk slowly.

710
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:17,389
I also need to take my time to do things.

711
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,620
And take my time to judge people.

712
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,429
There are many things I didn't understand before.

713
00:34:21,889 --> 00:34:23,820
I've understood more after thinking about it.

714
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:28,980
Jiutian, tell me what you want to do.

715
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,989
I'll help you.

716
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,260
Well, Brother

717
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,440
and Fengling

718
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,949
have worried too much about me.

719
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:37,550
I want to try the rest by myself.

720
00:34:38,179 --> 00:34:40,030
If there's something I can't get through,

721
00:34:40,370 --> 00:34:40,949
I'll come to you again.

722
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,219
Jiutian.

723
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:45,300
I...

724
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:46,620
Brother.

725
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,389
I've been thinking

726
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,840
how those successful people

727
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:51,199
succeed.

728
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:53,050
They must have

729
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,070
had their ups and downs to get there.

730
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:58,030
I'm crippled now.

731
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,100
I also have

732
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,780
ups and downs on my way.

733
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,750
Ups and downs, right?

734
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:06,030
Maybe as I walk,

735
00:35:06,490 --> 00:35:07,290
I can achieve something.

736
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,140
It's worth what I've suffered before.

737
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:18,800
Well said.

738
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,110
Biao.

739
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:26,480
This is for you.

740
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,630
Brother.

741
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,900
This is black sandalwood.

742
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,250
You are so generous.

743
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:35,300
It's alright.

744
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:36,310
Thank you.

745
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:38,320
I made it customized for you.

746
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,260
Try if the length is right.

747
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:41,980
I'll walk a few steps.

748
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,250
It's perfect.

749
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,020
It's perfect.

750
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,710
It walks nicely.

751
00:35:50,210 --> 00:35:50,830
Comfortable.

752
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,110
Jiutian.

753
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:55,800
The reason why your legs are like this now is...

754
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,020
Forget it.

755
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:03,650
Biao.

756
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:04,450
Director.

757
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:06,130
Get more people for Jiutian

758
00:36:06,250 --> 00:36:07,050
to take good care of him.

759
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:08,770
When I went out today,

760
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:10,080
Biao has already

761
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,040
appointed several people to me.

762
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:12,090
They've been following me today.

763
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,440
My legs are not functional,

764
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:14,490
but with these people,

765
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,250
it's really more convenient.

766
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:17,640
I don't blame others for my leg.

767
00:36:17,930 --> 00:36:19,440
I didn't take the right path before.

768
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,790
But don't worry, Brother.

769
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,760
I will work harder in the future.

770
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,530
Are you guys talking about something serious?

771
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,670
Go on.

772
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,260
I've been walking all day. I'm hungry.

773
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,140
I'll go in and eat something.

774
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:30,110
Go.

775
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:31,200
Let me help you.

776
00:36:31,330 --> 00:36:32,170
No need.

777
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,130
Look, I...

778
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,270
I can try out the stick.

779
00:36:34,770 --> 00:36:36,240
Father, look.

780
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,210
Brother bought it for me.

781
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,730
A new black sandalwood stick.

782
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,730
Worth a lot.

783
00:36:42,790 --> 00:36:44,770
Is there any cold food left in the kitchen?

784
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,070
Leftover is alright. I'll take a bite.

785
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,910
Leftover.

786
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:50,560
Fengling.

787
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,490
Fengling.

788
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,420
Do you think the Han Tomb incident in the Tianling Mountain

789
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,490
was done by Jiutian?

790
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:06,650
No way.

791
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:15,800
Biao.

792
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,560
Yes.

793
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:17,820
Go check

794
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,550
if Xue Dingfeng and his four brothers

795
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,940
have secret connections with Jiutian.

796
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,330
Yes.

797
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,570
You got him?

798
00:37:34,070 --> 00:37:34,830
Yes, Master.

799
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,220
I've got him.

800
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,650
Luo Jiutian is too arrogant.

801
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,540
He doesn't believe anyone dares to lie to him.

802
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:45,960
Arrogance makes people ignorant.

803
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:47,850
Besides,

804
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:49,430
he seems to be short of money.

805
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,660
Luo Yunsong is not rich.

806
00:37:56,370 --> 00:37:58,310
He's also strict with Luo Jiutian.

807
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,870
So Luo Jiutian is really short of money.

808
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,030
It's easier then.

809
00:38:13,950 --> 00:38:14,730
Master,

810
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,460
your judgment on Luo Jiutian was right.

811
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,560
He can't make it out this time.

812
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,530
No hurry.

813
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,930
Take our time.

814
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,490
Luo Jiutian

815
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,090
is just an appetizer. It's easy to handle him.

816
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,060
Most importantly,

817
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:31,950
we can't make Luo Yunsong

818
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,540
aware.

819
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:35,480
Don't worry, Master.

820
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,660
Well,

821
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,850
have you transferred your men here?

822
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,280
Yes, Master.

823
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,250
I've arranged them

824
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,550
to live in different places since you mentioned it last time.

825
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,490
They are on duty day and night.

826
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,960
Okay.

827
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,350
With them around, I wouldn't be not able to

828
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,030
hear or see.

829
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:57,990
How's the thing I asked you to do?

830
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,260
I've found it out.

831
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:08,860
Master,

832
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:10,500
why did you ask me to investigate this?

833
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:12,270
These are all accounts.

834
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:15,000
Accounts need to be clear.

835
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:17,310
Luo Yunsong

836
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,780
even published on the newspaper

837
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,500
to frame Penta-sect for tomb raiding.

838
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,510
Besides,

839
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,940
he even published the photo of the dragon bone.

840
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,470
I won't let this slide.

841
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:31,210
Not only do I want the dragon bone back,

842
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,650
I want him to pay a bigger price.

843
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,370
Yes.

844
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,490
Young Master, this...

845
00:39:59,220 --> 00:39:59,810
Open the door.

846
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,290
Who is it?

847
00:40:11,690 --> 00:40:12,410
Yunqi.

848
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:14,470
Wu Shuang.

849
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:15,220
Senior Jiang.

850
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,570
Thank you.

851
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,340
Have a seat.

852
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:20,470
Have some tea.

853
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:23,100
Master only asked me to deliver the letter,

854
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,040
not to have tea.

855
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:25,260
I'll go back and report.

856
00:40:25,610 --> 00:40:26,230
I'll come by next time.

857
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,910
Let me see you off.

858
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,460
Take care, Senior Jiang.

859
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:47,180
[Zhou Qiuhai. The month of Bingchun, the year of Earth Dragon]

860
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,070
What did Master say?

861
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,540
Cui Yi, munitions dealer.

862
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,800
Xuanwei Zitan,

863
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,240
Cui Yanzhi's subordinate.

864
00:40:58,190 --> 00:40:59,190
Cui Yi.

865
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,070
Munitions dealer.

866
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:06,250
I told Master that someone used explosives

867
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:07,550
to blow up the tomb hole.

868
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:09,480
I didn't expect him to find out so soon.

869
00:41:10,370 --> 00:41:11,850
Your master helped me figure out the explosives?

870
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,680
What do you mean by help you?

871
00:41:13,810 --> 00:41:15,120
He was helping me.

872
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:17,510
No matter who he wanted to help,

873
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,400
your master did a good job.

874
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,560
He's worth to be the leader of the gang.

875
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:22,590
Of course.

876
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,690
Wait.

877
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,410
Did you tell your master where we live?

878
00:41:28,430 --> 00:41:30,020
I was going to tell him,

879
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,580
but Master didn't let me tell him.

880
00:41:33,630 --> 00:41:35,310
But how did Senior Jiang find us?

881
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,300
The day after you came to me,

882
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:41,740
there was a new wonton stall downstairs.

883
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:44,050
The wonton stall hasn't been doing well.

884
00:41:44,390 --> 00:41:45,520
Two days ago, there was a new clerk.

885
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,190
He was always slacking off.

886
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,990
A pack of cigarettes.

887
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:47,870
Okay.

888
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,220
The cigarette guy has been changed too.

889
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:50,220
He never goes anywhere,

890
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,740
only selling cigarettes downstairs.

891
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:56,150
Young Master, now that you mention it,

892
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,330
we have a new fruit stall near here.

893
00:41:58,620 --> 00:42:00,220
No wonder when I wanted to buy apples,

894
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,850
it was more convenient.

895
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:01,600
Take care.

896
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,750
You mean

897
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,220
Master sent someone

898
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,810
to spy on us?

899
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,130
Master wouldn't do that.

900
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:11,810
Why not?

901
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:15,090
Your master is not monitoring us.

902
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,530
Like you said, it's because of you,

903
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:19,750
not me.

904
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:21,390
Because of me?

905
00:42:21,850 --> 00:42:22,600
Of course.

906
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,080
When the child travels far away, the mother worries about him.

907
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:28,060
He does it like a master.

908
00:42:28,950 --> 00:42:29,620
All right.

909
00:42:29,910 --> 00:42:31,800
Don't waste his effort.

910
00:42:37,470 --> 00:42:39,030
Xuanwei Zitan.

911
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,250
I'll go and meet

912
00:42:41,380 --> 00:42:43,440
the famous Cui Yanzhi.
