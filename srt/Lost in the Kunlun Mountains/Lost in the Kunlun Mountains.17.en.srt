[Episode 17]

4
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,560
Wu Shuang, lend me your Jingang Rope.

5
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,000
Dad.

6
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,470
From now on,

7
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:37,160
there is no Penta-sect in this world.

8
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,740
He hasn't returned to the bell tower yet?

9
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,590
Members of Qian Li Huo who're guarding the bell tower said

10
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,880
he hasn't come back.

11
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,330
Where can he go?

12
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,160
We've searched everywhere.

13
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,030
You said the rickshaw man who picked them up

14
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,810
often appeared near the bell tower recently?

15
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:22,600
Yes.

16
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,800
These rickshaws belong to Shuntong Vehicle Shop.

17
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:29,160
There have been three rickshaw men

18
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,000
who often waited near the bell tower.

19
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,260
They're all from Shuntong Vehicle Shop.

20
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:34,700
When they first appeared,

21
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,340
I asked my men to keep an eye on them.

22
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,510
They returned the rickshaws

23
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,730
to the shop every time.

24
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,260
There was nothing unusual.

25
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,000
So I didn't pay much attention to them later.

26
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,320
But today,

27
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,660
something was wrong.

28
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,640
And so far,

29
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,710
the rickshaw men who used to wait near the bell tower

30
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,240
have never appeared again.

31
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,930
Did you find out who fired

32
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,760
the mover signal flare near the bell tower?

33
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,060
No.

34
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,720
Members of Qian Li Huo

35
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,810
only saw the persons who fired ghoul signal flares.

36
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,730
It seems

37
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:19,140
movers are already in Shanghai.

38
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,210
They've already contacted Yunqi.

39
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,450
The rickshaw man who picked Yunqi up that day

40
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,770
should be a mover.

41
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,540
I deserve to die.

42
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,150
I didn't know movers were in Shanghai.

43
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,380
It's not your fault.

44
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,280
Movers are always good at

45
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,210
hiding their actions. Besides,

46
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:46,070
they didn't do anything.

47
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,650
How could you find out?

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,880
I'm incompetent.

49
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,580
Yunqi's actions

50
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,020
are under our control.

51
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:00,170
How did movers contact him?

52
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,030
Unless...

53
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,280
Unless these movers have been hiding

54
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:12,660
among the people Yunqi usually contacts.

55
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,720
Where's Wu Shuang?

56
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,060
She went out.

57
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:26,500
She said someone was looking for her.

58
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,100
But she didn't know who it was

59
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:30,270
and why the person wanted to see her.

60
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,590
It must be Yunqi.

61
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,390
Otherwise, she wouldn't go out.

62
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,560
Master,

63
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,450
do you think

64
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,460
Wu Shuang knows who the movers are?

65
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:50,430
Not necessarily.

66
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:55,100
It depends on how much Yunqi has told her.

67
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,650
Penta-sect.

68
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,500
Mountain mover.

69
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,050
Mingyi Palace.

70
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,350
Cui Yanzhi.

71
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:20,230
Hello, Sect Leader of the Gold Touching Sect.

72
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,910
Please forgive me

73
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,430
for my previous offence.

74
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,160
It doesn't matter.

75
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,220
It doesn't matter.

76
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,350
Mountain movers

77
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:33,280
take orders only from the Heaven Official.

78
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,040
You show

79
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,250
no traces.

80
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,320
I'm just the Acting Sect Leader of the Gold Touching Sect,

81
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,710
not the Heaven Official.

82
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:40,420
From now on,

83
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,990
we're brother and sister. Don't stand on ceremony.

84
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:50,040
Thank you for your understanding.

85
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,100
Brother.

86
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,630
I have a request.

87
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,610
About my identity...

88
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,500
I understand. Although I'm uneducated,

89
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,650
I know

90
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,740
what I should say

91
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:06,140
and what I shouldn't say.

92
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,030
Does Wu Shuang

93
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,630
know your identity?

94
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,350
I don't think so.

95
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:16,710
When we were bidding farewell to Master Ding on the shore,

96
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,390
I stood behind her specially.

97
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,610
She didn't see our salute.

98
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,630
That's good.

99
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,900
Ms. Cui,

100
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:26,740
Luo Yunsong is here.

101
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,430
How many people?

102
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,780
He and He Biao.

103
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,780
He said Yunqi invited him here.

104
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:34,240
But when he came here before, no one was here.

105
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Let him in.

106
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,680
Yunqi.

107
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,070
Go in and take a rest.

108
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:55,850
Master Jiu,

109
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,450
why did the Dragon Sceptre

110
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:58,659
explode?

111
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,130
Its full name is Lihuo Dragon Sceptre.

112
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:08,790
Lihuo in the 64 hexagrams of Zhouyi

113
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,570
belongs to the 30th hexagram.

114
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,860
The two kinds of fire are in sync.

115
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,590
So this sceptre can never get close to fire.

116
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:19,030
I've heard about it before.

117
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,760
The Dragon Sceptre can't be too close to the fire.

118
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:24,160
Back then, Bodhidharma

119
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,630
created a weapon

120
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,850
called Nanming Lihuo Sword.

121
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:31,420
Once the sword was drawn, there would be Baizhanghong.

122
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,690
All demons must evade it.

123
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,710
If they couldn't evade it,

124
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,510
even with a thousand years of cultivation,

125
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:40,500
they would be destroyed and be doomed forever.

126
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,630
Back then, I only heard that there was Baizhanghong in the Lihuo Dragon Sceptre.

127
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,760
But I didn't understand what it meant.

128
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,660
From what I saw today,

129
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,140
the one shot from the Dragon Sceptre

130
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,450
should be Baizhanghong.

131
00:08:55,990 --> 00:08:57,630
But I don't know

132
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,520
its function.

133
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:03,550
Yunqi.

134
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,230
Luo Yunsong is here.

135
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,040
Brother.

136
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,630
Besides the people we can see,

137
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,760
there are many people lying in ambush.

138
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,520
Ignore them. Go in.

139
00:09:55,670 --> 00:09:57,270
You were looking for me in such a hurry,

140
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,610
but you disappeared.

141
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,920
What happened?

142
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,440
You're late.

143
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,710
What do you mean?

144
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,580
Haven't you been looking for my father?

145
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:09,660
Where is he?

146
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:11,630
He's gone.

147
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,590
Are you kidding me, Ding Yunqi?

148
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,350
Where is he? Let him out!

149
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:18,810
Luo Yunsong, how dare you!

150
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,280
My father

151
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:41,910
passed away.

152
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,210
I asked you here

153
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,470
because I wanted my father to tell you

154
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:50,530
about your family.

155
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,920
He didn't do that. It has nothing to do with him.

156
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,260
It has nothing to do with him?

157
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,580
Just because you said so,

158
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,040
we can be even?

159
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,970
Does that make sense?

160
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:06,950
We were all there.

161
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,920
Everyone heard it. I can testify.

162
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,930
If you don't believe me,

163
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:11,190
I can tell Fengling.

164
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:12,590
Don't involve Fengling.

165
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,640
Luo Yunsong, I'm warning you.

166
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,230
Don't make a scene here.

167
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,560
This is not the time for you to make a scene.

168
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:23,490
Fine.

169
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,820
I want to mourn for your father.

170
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,830
According to the tradition of the Penta-sect,

171
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,680
there was only a water burial. He has no tomb.

172
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
So there is no evidence.

173
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,450
Luo Yunsong!

174
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,080
Young man,

175
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,180
think carefully.

176
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,630
If you take out what you shouldn't take out,

177
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,710
today,

178
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:51,210
no one can walk out of this door.

179
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,780
-Don't move! -Don't move!

180
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,580
-Don't move! -Don't move!

181
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:02,040
-Don't move! -Don't move!

182
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,370
Sister.

183
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,280
You're Cui Yanzhi?

184
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,880
Mr. Luo,

185
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:25,320
what can I do for you?

186
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,930
My brother Luo Jiutian

187
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:30,230
was framed.

188
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,210
You're part of it.

189
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,910
Mr. Luo, what you said is so unfair.

190
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,530
He begged me

191
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,260
to borrow my people.

192
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,820
I felt sorry for him,

193
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,250
so I lent him some brothers.

194
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,860
I didn't expect him to do opium business.

195
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,920
Because of him, I was arrested

196
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,720
and interrogated for a few days.

197
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,680
I also lost several of my brothers.

198
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:09,670
But you

199
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:13,190
blamed Master Tian's death

200
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:14,920
on me.

201
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:16,890
He

202
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:20,120
was killed by Commander Hu.

203
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:22,390
If you want revenge,

204
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,930
take revenge on Commander Hu.

205
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,260
Mr. Luo.

206
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,080
It's not your usual style

207
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,730
to take everyone as your enemies.

208
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:42,090
You know how to

209
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:43,310
clear your name.

210
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,650
Let me tell you.

211
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,690
I never hold a grudge against anyone.

212
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:55,290
But if someone was really my enemy,

213
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,510
I would let him suffer.

214
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:04,390
That's right.

215
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,690
You saved my life.

216
00:14:05,690 --> 00:14:07,500
But as you said, these are two different things.

217
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,100
As long as I'm alive,

218
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,030
I'm telling you.

219
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,150
This is not over.

220
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:17,580
Why are you so stubborn?

221
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:18,920
Wu Shuang.

222
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,140
Cut the crap.

223
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,970
It's like we're afraid of him.

224
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,880
If you want to take revenge, come.

225
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,520
We've fought against many people.

226
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:26,850
You're not the only one.

227
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,620
People should only blame the person who is held accountable.

228
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,550
But if anyone wants to be involved,

229
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,290
I'll welcome you.

230
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:54,580
Let them go.

231
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,420
I know

232
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,430
what you want to say.

233
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,950
Give me two days.

234
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,040
I'll reply.

235
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,340
My lady.

236
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:53,970
Brother.

237
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:54,680
Fengling.

238
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,020
Where have you been?

239
00:15:57,960 --> 00:16:00,180
I dealt with something with Biao.

240
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:01,830
Sit.

241
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,140
Sit, Biao.

242
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,850
No, brother.

243
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,460
We can't break the rules.

244
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,250
What did you call me?

245
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,270
Brother.

246
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,000
Right. So we're brothers.

247
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:21,990
Brothers should eat on the same table. Sit down.

248
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:23,430
Biao.

249
00:16:24,210 --> 00:16:24,890
Sit down.

250
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:27,900
OK.

251
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:28,700
Auntie Hei,

252
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:29,830
give Biao a bowl and a pair of chopsticks.

253
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:30,370
OK.

254
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:45,960
Jiutian's bowl and chopsticks

255
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:48,100
should be placed like this every day.

256
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,500
Don't remove them.

257
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,420
When we're eating,

258
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,440
the whole family should be here.

259
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,520
Let's eat.

260
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:11,650
Brother.

261
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,359
I visited Her Ladyship this afternoon.

262
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,079
What did she say?

263
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,770
Her Ladyship has issued a new appointment.

264
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,670
Certificate of Appointment. The team of the Kunlun Mountains.

265
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:48,500
[Certificate of Appointment]

266
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,830
I hereby appoint Chu Fengling as a special member.

267
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:50,290
Luo Yunsong is the deputy.

268
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,570
The Black Feather Team is changed into the action team.

269
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,170
The Department of Internal Affairs of the National Government.

270
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,470
Let's eat, Biao.

271
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,500
Her Ladyship gave us a special fund this time.

272
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,390
She also prepared the most advanced weapons

273
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,920
for the Black Feather Team.

274
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,530
Her Ladyship called your name.

275
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,860
Brother, will you join?

276
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,900
[Officer of the Kuomintang of the Republic of China]

277
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,140
The Department of Internal Affairs has been the first major department

278
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:29,110
since the reorganization of the National Government.

279
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:31,130
With the support of the Department of Internal Affairs,

280
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,140
it'll be easier for us to do things.

281
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:36,590
Brother.

282
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:40,410
Please help me. If you join...

283
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:40,900
Okay.

284
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,940
You agreed?

285
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,620
Yes, I agreed.

286
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,880
I didn't expect you...

287
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,510
I know.

288
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,820
You thought I would sulk

289
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,000
and refuse this job.

290
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:53,550
Fengling.

291
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:55,850
I'm not a kid anymore.

292
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,120
What I need to do

293
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,310
can't be done on my own.

294
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,280
I need support.

295
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,010
Apart from

296
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:05,480
the most advanced weapons

297
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,950
Her Ladyship has prepared,

298
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,880
is there any other authorization?

299
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,770
No.

300
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,730
Don't let the falcon loose until you see the hare.

301
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,030
Half a loaf is better than none.

302
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:23,120
It's better than receiving nothing.

303
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:24,840
Fengling.

304
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,700
I didn't expect

305
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,580
we could make a comeback

306
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,610
because of you.

307
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:33,710
Brother.

308
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,850
This is what I should do.

309
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,860
Great. You've grown up.

310
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:40,850
Great.

311
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,660
You agreed so soon.

312
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,550
I went to see Yunqi tonight,

313
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,020
but he was not there.

314
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,350
I'll visit him tomorrow

315
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,090
and talk to him.

316
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,270
If both you and Yunqi can join,

317
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,780
I'll be relieved.

318
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,420
Don't visit him now.

319
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,550
It's not the right time.

320
00:19:58,450 --> 00:19:59,250
What's wrong?

321
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,920
Ding Yuanshan just passed away.

322
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,090
Ding Yuanshan died?

323
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,100
How did you know?

324
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,870
I just met Yunqi.

325
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,180
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

326
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:18,770
I need to see him.

327
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:19,950
Don't worry.

328
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:22,760
Brother.

329
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,170
Yunqi helped me a lot before.

330
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,540
He saved us this time.

331
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,200
How could I not care about him?

332
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:29,420
It's too late.

333
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,270
Be good. Go there tomorrow.

334
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,530
Besides,

335
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,400
he's probably not in the mood

336
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,980
for seeing anyone now.

337
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:40,480
I'll go with you tomorrow.

338
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,460
Okay.

339
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,700
I'll visit him tomorrow.

340
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,480
Let's eat first.

341
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:47,300
Yunqi.

342
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,490
Why are you sitting on the roof?

343
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,020
What are you doing?

344
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,710
Are you slacking off again?

345
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:59,540
Come down and hit the stake.

346
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,000
Step on the palace tentatively.

347
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:51,340
Move my hands to ward off evil spirits.

348
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,310
Under my arm, the wind is flying and white clouds are floating.

349
00:22:57,310 --> 00:23:00,130
I can be free and carefree.

350
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,620
I'm invisible.

351
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,810
I can do whatever I want.

352
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:10,920
Bodies are not bodies. Hands are not hands.

353
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:12,810
None

354
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,730
is the beginning of the world.

355
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,340
All

356
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,940
is the mother of everything.

357
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,720
Step on Kuigang and destroy the enemies' places.

358
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,250
Heaven, earth, deities and humans are in a line.

359
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:32,760
Yunqi.

360
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,280
Yunqi.

361
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:39,020
Dad.

362
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,620
I'm practicing.

363
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:42,470
I'm practicing.

364
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,900
I won't slack off anymore.

365
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,300
Yunqi.

366
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:09,890
If you want to come back,

367
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,230
I'll help you clean this courtyard up.

368
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,430
He's gone.

369
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,980
Why should I come back?

370
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,080
But this is your home.

371
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,390
Home?

372
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,910
When I was eight,

373
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:26,310
my mother was gone.

374
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,870
I waited for her to come home every day.

375
00:24:30,130 --> 00:24:32,930
I cried every day because I couldn't see my mother.

376
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,200
My father took me to Shanghai.

377
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,940
He took me to this place

378
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:38,320
and told me

379
00:24:39,010 --> 00:24:40,170
from that moment on,

380
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:41,730
this was my home.

381
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:43,660
I knew

382
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,010
a place without my mother

383
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:48,280
was not my home.

384
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:50,990
So I started to hate my father

385
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,230
and this home.

386
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:56,490
I hated my father for not protecting my mother.

387
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,790
I hated my father for not protecting this family.

388
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:00,960
From then on,

389
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,020
I lost my home.

390
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,690
I used to believe

391
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:11,800
rivers were connected.

392
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:15,910
So,

393
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,760
I jumped into the river to find my mother.

394
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,700
Then my father saved me.

395
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,270
After that, I ran away from home several times,

396
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:41,930
but my father brought me back.

397
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,250
In this so-called home,

398
00:25:45,150 --> 00:25:47,550
only the days when you came here were happy.

399
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:49,040
For the rest of the time,

400
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,530
even the sky was dark.

401
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,490
When I came to England,

402
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,560
I was very happy.

403
00:26:01,730 --> 00:26:03,540
I finally felt free.

404
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,820
I didn't have to face this family.

405
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,790
I didn't have to face my father.

406
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,370
As time went by, I grew up.

407
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:16,690
I began to wonder

408
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,460
how my father was doing.

409
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,510
The education I used to hate

410
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,030
helped me unconsciously

411
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,710
when I was in trouble.

412
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,060
So I started to recall

413
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:36,090
what my father told me.

414
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:38,190
I regretted

415
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:41,690
that I didn't listen to him much.

416
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:46,270
I thought about it and thought too much.

417
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:47,680
I've figured it out.

418
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:51,910
Actually, my father was very nice to me

419
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:53,810
and my mother.

420
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,750
But

421
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:58,940
he had no choice.

422
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:02,300
Because he was in the Penta-sect.

423
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,350
He was the Heaven Official.

424
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,620
Now I realized

425
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:14,570
that I wronged my father.

426
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:16,950
I only blamed him,

427
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,340
hated him

428
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,610
and never forgave him.

429
00:27:24,350 --> 00:27:26,610
It's good that you have him in your heart.

430
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,490
I came back from England

431
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:31,110
because I wanted to treat him well.

432
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,620
I thought

433
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,230
my mother was gone,

434
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,400
so I couldn't lose my father.

435
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,290
With my father here,

436
00:27:40,050 --> 00:27:41,230
I had a home.

437
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,430
But now,

438
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:47,950
I have no home.

439
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:52,700
This time,

440
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,580
I really have no home.

441
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,100
You'll have your own home in the future.

442
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,350
No.

443
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:04,580
I don't want to have a home anymore.

444
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,480
Besides pain and regret,

445
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,830
it only brought me harm.

446
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:12,690
I don't want to experience

447
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,620
the pain of losing family anymore.

448
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,560
You don't understand.

449
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:25,790
Yes.

450
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,270
I don't understand.

451
00:28:29,530 --> 00:28:31,130
Because I never had a home.

452
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,250
I hope I haven't had a home.

453
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:40,610
Losing family is sadder than having no family.

454
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:47,670
Yunqi.

455
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,340
Actually, when Uncle Ding left,

456
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:56,700
he was content.

457
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:05,440
Besides, please don't say

458
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,240
that you don't want a home anymore

459
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,510
to the person who has no home.

460
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,160
Having no hope

461
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,200
is crueller than losing hope.

462
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,570
Wu Shuang, I'm sorry.

463
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:31,940
I just want to tell you

464
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,580
whether you have a home or not is the same.

465
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:45,470
The Dragon Sceptre is hot when it's on fire.

466
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,820
When the dragon's head popped out and exploded,

467
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:49,870
there was such a beautiful spark.

468
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,900
The person who created it did it on purpose.

469
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,090
Do you think it implies

470
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:59,560
that there's something mysterious hidden in the sceptre?

471
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:07,090
Its full name is Lihuo Dragon Sceptre.

472
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,820
The two kinds of fire are in sync.

473
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,470
So this sceptre can never get close to fire.

474
00:30:13,430 --> 00:30:14,400
You're smart.

475
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:18,090
There's something mysterious in it.

476
00:30:28,810 --> 00:30:29,860
What is this?

477
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,120
Lihuo faces Kanshui. The dragon's head faces Lihuo.

478
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,990
When it meets fire, it will shoot Baizhangchanghong.

479
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,250
Then the tail of the sceptre

480
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,720
should face Kanshui.

481
00:30:39,390 --> 00:30:42,120
The cloud follows dragons. The wind follows tigers.

482
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:43,250
The cloud is steam

483
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:45,250
which is corresponding to Kanshui.

484
00:30:45,270 --> 00:30:47,870
As the saying goes, dragons change with steam.

485
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,890
Whether there's something mysterious,

486
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,690
it depends on my understanding.

487
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,330
It's a Luban lock.

488
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,710
Can you open it?

489
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:29,410
Back then,

490
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,880
my father taught me how to open it here.

491
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:37,220
Turn three horizontally and lock one. Heaven and Earth are separate.

492
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:40,200
Twist five and handle six. Between the clouds and the water.

493
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,270
Turn two vertically and turn seven horizontally. The green dragon leaps.

494
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:45,960
The iron knife and armor. Phoenixes fly around.

495
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:48,900
A god touches my head.

496
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:52,230
The halberd will be valuable if all demons are killed.

497
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:55,030
Stick to the right path and have no worry.

498
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,260
I open my heart immediately.

499
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,070
This...

500
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,590
This is what everyone is looking for.

501
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,180
Do you know where the Kunlun Mountains is?

502
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,950
But it...

503
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,420
It turned into powder.

504
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:07,390
It's okay.

505
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,570
I remember it.

506
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:11,430
Wu Shuang.

507
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,270
Do you believe in fate?

508
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:18,650
For hundreds of years,

509
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:20,330
some people

510
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,370
tried their best to protect these things.

511
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,200
Some people even lost their lives

512
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,330
without finding it.

513
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,060
But today,

514
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:30,900
it just appeared in front of me.

515
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:32,930
And

516
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:35,150
it disappeared like this.

517
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:37,190
No one can see it anymore.

518
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:41,500
But do you really remember it?

519
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:45,280
The treasure of the Kunlun Mountains

520
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,670
definitely doesn't belong to the Penta-sect.

521
00:33:47,670 --> 00:33:49,600
If anyone is greedy for it,

522
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,460
you must use the power of the Penta-sect to eliminate them,

523
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,550
no matter who it is.

524
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,820
When the Book of Su appears,

525
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:59,050
it'll be the opening day of the Kunlun Mountains.

526
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,280
The Heaven Official who gets the Book of Su

527
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,180
must gather people to open the Kunlun Mountains

528
00:34:04,470 --> 00:34:07,870
and return the wealth of the world to all human beings.

529
00:34:10,179 --> 00:34:12,070
The wish of the ancestors of the Penta-sect

530
00:34:12,070 --> 00:34:13,670
is my father's wish.

531
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,940
At first,

532
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,460
I never wanted to interfere in the affairs of the Penta-sect.

533
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,980
But my father passed away.

534
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:22,190
Many people

535
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:24,320
died because of the Kunlun Mountains.

536
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,100
I must stop it.

537
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:28,750
Maybe

538
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,510
this is my fate.

539
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,270
This mission

540
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,380
is also the fate of the Ding family.

541
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,150
So I've decided

542
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:41,889
to open the Kunlun Mountains.

543
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:47,360
You agreed to be the Heaven Official?

544
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,190
No.

545
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:52,850
I want to find the Kunlun Mountains

546
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:54,909
and return the wealth of the world

547
00:34:54,909 --> 00:34:56,510
to all human beings.

548
00:35:28,010 --> 00:35:28,890
Tell me.

549
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,120
Where did Yunqi go?

550
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,210
At a time like this,

551
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:39,980
he doesn't want to see anyone.

552
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,860
He must be somewhere

553
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:42,260
where no one can find him.

554
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,810
What did you do

555
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,200
with Yunqi yesterday?

556
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:50,520
When they were talking,

557
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:51,780
Brother didn't let me stay there.

558
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:52,660
I don't know.

559
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:00,350
You made progress.

560
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:02,120
What do you mean?

561
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:05,090
Although you didn't tell me the truth,

562
00:36:05,550 --> 00:36:07,020
at least you didn't refuse to tell me

563
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,540
frostily like before.

564
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,910
It's okay. This is a good start.

565
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,590
I won't force you.

566
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:16,850
Let me know

567
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:18,180
when you want to tell me.

568
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,990
How many people

569
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,920
are spying around here?

570
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,020
Why can't I see anything?

571
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,520
What?

572
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:01,490
Can't you tell me about it?

573
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,430
I can tell you.

574
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:04,880
There are our people.

575
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,420
Where are they?

576
00:37:08,470 --> 00:37:09,730
You can't see them.

577
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,790
There are also people from the Mound-digging Sect.

578
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:13,720
Which one?

579
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,550
The wonton stall. The fruit stall.

580
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:20,860
-And the one who's selling cigarettes there. -Pick one you like.

581
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:21,030
[Zhu's]

582
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,510
Cigarettes!

583
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,120
Cigarettes!

584
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,320
Is there anyone else?

585
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,980
Commander Hu also sent some people to spy here.

586
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,740
But their identities are unclear.

587
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,270
We're not certain about it.

588
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,230
Only these three?

589
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:40,090
I think people from the Gold Touching Sect are here too.

590
00:37:42,070 --> 00:37:43,750
Poor Yunqi.

591
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,730
He's being watched by so many people every day.

592
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,250
But he can go everywhere he wants to go.

593
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,710
No one knows where he went.

594
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:53,580
Awesome!

595
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,440
[Zhu's Wonton]

596
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,800
Biao.

597
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,730
Eat a bowl of wontons with me.

598
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,660
My lady.

599
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:05,380
You changed.

600
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:07,440
Why?

601
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,240
I don't know.

602
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,340
You didn't like

603
00:38:11,550 --> 00:38:13,210
to provoke others in the past.

604
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:15,500
Yes.

605
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,520
As you said, that was the past.

606
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,500
Now,

607
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:22,330
I want to change my way of life.

608
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:25,620
Biao, let's go.

609
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,030
Have some wontons.

610
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,170
Dad.

611
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:44,770
I opened the Dragon Sceptre

612
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,810
and saw the Kunlun's Book of Su hidden inside.

613
00:38:50,690 --> 00:38:51,790
You're right.

614
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:54,470
The treasure of the Kunlun Mountains

615
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,650
was taken from the tombs

616
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:57,790
of those stupid and tyrannical kings and lords.

617
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:58,840
It was stored up

618
00:38:59,050 --> 00:39:01,360
in order to help poor people.

619
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,470
The words on the dragon bones

620
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:06,650
record the address of the Kunlun Mountains.

621
00:39:06,650 --> 00:39:07,960
I need to read the Book of Ban

622
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,090
to decipher it.

623
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,550
To open the Kunlun Mountains,

624
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:15,280
I need to gather five soul pursuit orders from the Penta-sect.

625
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,820
Dad, I've made up my mind.

626
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,420
I'm going to find the Kunlun Mountains,

627
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,550
no matter how difficult it is.
