[Episode 35]

4
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,720
Yunqi.

5
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:21,660
Brother.

6
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:22,500
What happened?

7
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:26,030
The Black Feather Team caught them as soon as they arrived.

8
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,380
We were careless.

9
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,060
They found here first.

10
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,410
You're just the soldiers who work for others.

11
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,600
You don't need to lose your life.

12
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,320
Tell me.

13
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,710
Who asked you to come?

14
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:46,190
Tell him.

15
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,280
It's Her Ladyship.

16
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:50,060
Why did she ask you to come?

17
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,790
We're on an investigation mission.

18
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,170
In order to prepare for the action

19
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:55,600
of killing tomb raiders.

20
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,970
Did you see it clearly?

21
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,490
Do we look like tomb raiders?

22
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,730
We received an order last night

23
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:07,860
to execute tomb raiders

24
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,580
in three days.

25
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,970
Kill Chu and Luo

26
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:12,150
and control Ding Yunqi.

27
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,700
That's impossible.

28
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,170
That's absolutely impossible.

29
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,130
He's talking nonsense.

30
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,940
We're telling the truth. We're not lying.

31
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,490
Fengling, look.

32
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,100
You are just a pawn of Her Ladyship.

33
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:28,340
Now,

34
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:30,370
you've been abandoned.

35
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:32,940
Nonsense!

36
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:34,829
I haven't been abandoned. I'm useful.

37
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:36,420
Tell me.

38
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,030
Who sent you here?

39
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,170
Did my brother send you here?

40
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,230
Your uniforms don't fit at all.

41
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,640
Yes.

42
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,320
Say it.

43
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:49,690
Miss.

44
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:51,160
You were not sent by Her Ladyship, right?

45
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,940
Miss. Heroine. Madam.

46
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,700
What we said is the truth.

47
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,090
I have a wife and kids at home.

48
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,100
Please let me go.

49
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,440
Please.

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,120
Tell me.

51
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,790
I...

52
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:02,960
I lied.

53
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,430
They're not true.

54
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:05,610
I lied.

55
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,810
Joke.

56
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,630
Joke.

57
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,810
I'm just a joke.

58
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,590
Why?

59
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:40,430
Brother.

60
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,570
I was wrong.

61
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,310
From now on, you won't have me anymore.

62
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,200
Chu Fengling, you have no right to die.

63
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,460
Your life

64
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,930
was saved by He Biao with his life.

65
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,740
Kill me.

66
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,400
Take a message for me.

67
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,590
OK.

68
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,480
I'll definitely bring every words you said back.

69
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,210
I'll open the Kunlun Mountains in three days.

70
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,380
Within three days,

71
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:25,490
I hope Her Ladyship and your officer

72
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:26,920
don't try to send any soldiers here again

73
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,600
and don't try to figure out my bottom line.

74
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:30,570
Otherwise, I'll let them know

75
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,460
I can destroy the Kunlun Mountains.

76
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,850
-OK. -OK.

77
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:35,110
-Don't worry. -OK.

78
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,850
Master.

79
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,860
If what those two soldiers said is true,

80
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,540
Ding Yunqi don't have much time left.

81
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,350
We don't have much time left either.

82
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,240
Master.

83
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,960
Since you've known

84
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:49,260
how Ding Yunqi would open the Kunlun Mountains

85
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,570
in the underground palace.

86
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,340
Why don't we go ahead of him?

87
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,980
There's no hurry.

88
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,990
Just wait.

89
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,240
It seems

90
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,380
Ms. Chu

91
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,770
really gives up on Her Ladyship this time.

92
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,620
Justice prevails over evil.

93
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,380
Sooner or later,

94
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:53,190
people will know what kind of person Her Ladyship is.

95
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,800
I heard a loud bang

96
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:03,200
from the cave.

97
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,760
I was afraid something might happen to you,

98
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,120
so I came to check.

99
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:09,900
Thank you for your concern.

100
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,250
The problem has been solved.

101
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,010
Today is a good time.

102
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,730
Have you prepared

103
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,490
what I told you before?

104
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,110
Yunqi, our new encampment has been exposed again.

105
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,250
Do we have to move?

106
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,350
Just stay here.

107
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,940
It can't always be us to move.

108
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:27,960
It's time for them to move.

109
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,810
Why are you dressed like this?

110
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,940
What's your relationship with Ding Yunqi?

111
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,390
Are you here for Brother Ding?

112
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,490
Brother, let's inform Brother Ding.

113
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,120
Let's go.

114
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,340
Chase them!

115
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,010
What is this place?

116
00:10:59,000 --> 00:10:59,890
Let's go.

117
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,890
Master, why are these villagers

118
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,030
so tough?

119
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,600
I feel strange too.

120
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,910
They are dressed in an ancient style,

121
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:53,220
and they're good at throwing stones with primitive weapons

122
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,230
such as bows and spears.

123
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:55,870
I think

124
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,520
they jumped out of an ancient tomb.

125
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,030
This terrain

126
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,360
is like the terrain of Bawang Xiejia.

127
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:03,140
And this place is heavily guarded.

128
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:06,960
Maybe it's the entrance to the Kunlun Mountains.

129
00:12:07,590 --> 00:12:09,440
But Boss's corpse is still inside.

130
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,370
I'll gather all our people

131
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:12,670
to fight back.

132
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:14,550
Why are you so foolish?

133
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,460
If it's really the Kunlun Mountains,

134
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:19,850
Boss's death is worthwhile.

135
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,400
But if he weren't dead

136
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,610
and said something that shouldn't be said,

137
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,590
we'd be in trouble.

138
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,230
Go back now

139
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,860
and tell the others to move the encampment.

140
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,710
Yes.

141
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,930
Thank you.

142
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:46,690
You've helped us a lot.

143
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,460
We thought we could catch Zhou Qiuhai.

144
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,690
Unexpectedly, he was too cunning.

145
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,330
Zhou Qiuhai is paranoid.

146
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,930
It was not easy to lure him into the cave.

147
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,530
We need to give him the chance to take the initiative.

148
00:12:58,870 --> 00:12:59,920
Let him think

149
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,220
everything is under his control.

150
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,950
In this way, he'll fall into the trap easily.

151
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:05,970
I think today

152
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,390
he might believe

153
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:08,700
there's an important connection

154
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,000
between the Xueju Cave and the Kunlun Mountains.

155
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,380
Yes.

156
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:13,150
Only when he is careless can we have a chance.

157
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,340
Zhou Qiuhai and Her Ladyship

158
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:18,310
are the rivals who are hard to deal with.

159
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,660
Maybe

160
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,930
only the Heaven Official's headquarters

161
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,980
can be your shelter.

162
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,020
But I

163
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:29,490
haven't found

164
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,120
how to crack the key to the star map.

165
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:38,890
Yunqi. Brother.

166
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:39,990
Biao woke up.

167
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:48,340
Yunqi.

168
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:49,770
Brother.

169
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:52,590
How's Fengling?

170
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,220
Fengling is fine.

171
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,370
How are you?

172
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:58,470
I'm fine.

173
00:13:58,930 --> 00:13:59,940
I'm good.

174
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:04,550
Let me see.

175
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,000
Does your foot hurt?

176
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,910
How do you feel?

177
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,870
I have no feelings.

178
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:01,970
Have you made up your mind?

179
00:15:07,450 --> 00:15:08,430
I've decided.

180
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:11,210
I'll take He Biao to see a doctor first.

181
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,470
He got hurt because of me.

182
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,200
I can't miss

183
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,750
the best time for his treatment.

184
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,560
Even if he couldn't be cured,

185
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,700
I would take care of him forever.

186
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:26,450
I know

187
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:28,380
my apology

188
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,060
is valueless.

189
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,840
I understand now.

190
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,870
I don't expect you to forgive me.

191
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,850
But from now on,

192
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,370
I will try my best

193
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,600
to make up for my mistakes

194
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,490
as much

195
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:47,960
as I can.

196
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:04,500
Fengling.

197
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,050
There are some things

198
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,140
I haven't prepared for,

199
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:15,380
but I believe blood is thicker than water.

200
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:18,870
Maybe in the future...

201
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,640
Take care.

202
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,820
Fengling.

203
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,500
You'll always be

204
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,060
my most cherished sister.

205
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,480
Take care.

206
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:15,690
All right.

207
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,460
Go.

208
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,060
Go.

209
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:24,660
Don't worry, Brother Ding.

210
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,020
I'll send her off safely.

211
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:28,580
San.

212
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:29,840
Thank you.

213
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,790
Don't worry, Brother. I'll be back soon.

214
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:35,430
Let's go, bro.

215
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,440
Wu Shuang.

216
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,160
Do you have anything to say?

217
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,410
Are you still worried about your master?

218
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,510
I want to see him.

219
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,570
It's not necessary.

220
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,320
Do you want to persuade him?

221
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:48,050
He won't listen to you.

222
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,700
When I meet Master again,

223
00:18:52,510 --> 00:18:54,090
we'll be enemies then.

224
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,990
Although he's evil,

225
00:18:57,660 --> 00:18:59,300
he still raised me.

226
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:02,200
He's always been nice to me.

227
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,180
I want to say goodbye to him

228
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:07,200
and say goodbye to my past self.

229
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,650
Go.

230
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,740
Sooner or later,

231
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,130
you should be relieved.

232
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:15,770
No.

233
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,940
It's too risky.

234
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,960
What if Zhou Qiuhai ties you up?

235
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:19,920
Brother.

236
00:19:19,920 --> 00:19:20,600
How about this?

237
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,610
If you really want to go,

238
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,080
I'll go with you.

239
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:26,730
Brother.

240
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,280
Wu Shuang will be safe.

241
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,130
Zhou Qiuhai's target is me.

242
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,650
Besides, if he wanted to do it,

243
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:33,950
he would have done it long ago.

244
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,630
Go back first.

245
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,010
If you're nearby,

246
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,320
he won't show up.

247
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:46,800
Prepare signal flares.

248
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:48,520
If anything happens,

249
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,200
I'll show up immediately.

250
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:52,980
Don't worry, Brother.

251
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:54,780
If he said something

252
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,790
which upsets you...

253
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:56,920
All right.

254
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:58,810
I know you're worried about me.

255
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,200
I'm not a kid anymore.

256
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:02,010
Don't worry.

257
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,370
Brother, I'm leaving.

258
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,870
Don't worry.

259
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,550
She'll be fine.

260
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,620
Wu Shuang.

261
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,880
You are my good disciple.

262
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,490
At this critical moment,

263
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:13,250
you still want to see me.

264
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,790
Then why did Master

265
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,010
keep me waiting so long?

266
00:22:19,510 --> 00:22:21,110
Weren't you here already?

267
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:29,550
You said it out bluntly.

268
00:22:29,550 --> 00:22:31,190
Do you want to embarrass me?

269
00:22:32,570 --> 00:22:34,340
When will you

270
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:35,390
not tell

271
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,020
what you've seen through?

272
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,700
I'm just sad.

273
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,020
In Master's heart,

274
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,410
I can't be trusted.

275
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:54,080
Here.

276
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,220
Sit.

277
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,050
You...

278
00:23:06,670 --> 00:23:09,150
Now you know your identity,

279
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,180
and you love Ding Yunqi so much.

280
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,440
Can't I

281
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,550
be more cautious?

282
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,440
Otherwise, this old man

283
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,370
can't stand the torment.

284
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,410
Master, you've recovered.

285
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:27,250
Congratulations, Master.

286
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,240
You are so filial.

287
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,770
I'm glad I've treated you well.

288
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,830
You asked me to come.

289
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:43,890
I also want to tell you something.

290
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,940
I want to ask you something.

291
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,040
Are you

292
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:51,870
still willing to come back to me?

293
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,340
If you are willing,

294
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:07,070
I can teach you all the martial arts

295
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,370
I know.

296
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:11,770
I can also give you a part of the treasure

297
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:14,330
in the Kunlun Mountains.

298
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:18,110
Master.

299
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,500
You know me.

300
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,890
I'm not interested in these things.

301
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:28,910
I really raised

302
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,880
a heroine.

303
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,380
Wu Shuang.

304
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,690
The treasure won't bite you

305
00:24:38,690 --> 00:24:40,210
or burn your hands.

306
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:42,600
After getting the treasure,

307
00:24:42,770 --> 00:24:44,740
you can live somewhere else.

308
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,220
No one knows where the treasure comes from.

309
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,990
This is

310
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,420
just between you and me.

311
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:53,860
Master.

312
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,070
No secret

313
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,420
can be hidden forever.

314
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:59,230
Wu Shuang.

315
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,380
You...

316
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,210
I invited you here today

317
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,360
because I have a few questions to ask.

318
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,720
I may have no chance to ask them in the future.

319
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:16,410
Okay.

320
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:17,840
Go ahead.

321
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,180
Why didn't you kill me back then?

322
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,830
Instead, you brought me back to the mound-digging

323
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,050
and brought me up.

324
00:25:37,490 --> 00:25:38,630
Back then,

325
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:44,090
when I knew that Shou Wujiang had a wife

326
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:45,430
and kids outside,

327
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,780
I was really surprised.

328
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:53,620
Think about it.

329
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,690
The Sect Leader

330
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,250
broke the rules of the Penta-sect.

331
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:01,940
I must deal with it.

332
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,500
I was punishing him.

333
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,640
When I went to your parents' courtyard,

334
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,450
I wanted to catch them all.

335
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:15,920
But I didn't know what happened.

336
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,520
Maybe someone breathed a word.

337
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:21,720
Luo Yunsong took your younger sister away.

338
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,360
He left you and your mother.

339
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,010
Your mother

340
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:29,820
is really a tough woman.

341
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,800
She refused to let your father save her.

342
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,580
Then I thought

343
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:37,840
I could use you as a bait.

344
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:39,690
But I didn't expect

345
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:41,540
your father burst into the Dengkun Pavilion.

346
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:45,490
So I managed to kill him.

347
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:50,740
Then why didn't you kill me?

348
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,150
Did you lose your memory?

349
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,780
All these years,

350
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,250
have you seen me kill people?

351
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,770
Am I always killing people?

352
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,910
I thought

353
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,380
since the matter has been dealt with,

354
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,370
you were not a threat to me.

355
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,180
You were an orphan.

356
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,610
So I didn't kill you.

357
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,220
Then

358
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,870
you grew up.

359
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,050
You looked more and more like your mother.

360
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,740
Until then, I didn't understand why your father

361
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,060
betrayed the sect

362
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:43,280
for your mother.

363
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,140
So

364
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,670
I was thinking

365
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,290
how to make use of

366
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:03,340
this beautiful Wu Shuang.

367
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,930
What a coincidence!

368
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,790
That year,

369
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,350
Ding Yuanshan wanted to find

370
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:14,360
a friend for Ding Yunqi.

371
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,880
So I brought you there.

372
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:22,000
You didn't let me down.

373
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:24,820
Ding Yunqi

374
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:26,960
was smitten by you.

375
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:36,240
Otherwise, all my plans

376
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,800
would fall trough.

377
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:43,210
I don't know

378
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:44,550
how you think of me.

379
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,070
But in my heart,

380
00:28:48,250 --> 00:28:50,100
I've long regarded you as my father.

381
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,710
All these years,

382
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,730
have you ever treated me genuinely?

383
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,660
I grew up in the mound-digging too.

384
00:29:05,850 --> 00:29:07,530
I know the children of the mound-digging.

385
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:11,810
You know what?

386
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,830
Children raised in the mound-digging are really interesting.

387
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:16,980
They all hope

388
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,500
to be the most important person

389
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,010
in their master's heart.

390
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:23,280
But

391
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:29,450
for you,

392
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:34,580
I have an axe to grind.

393
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:39,950
I raised you as the most important child.

394
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,060
As time went by,

395
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,050
I stayed in character.

396
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,690
I always thought

397
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,340
I was your father.

398
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,950
I thought I was a good man.

399
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,770
Do you have anything else to ask?

400
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:04,410
That's all I want to ask.

401
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,230
I'm here today

402
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:11,420
to bid farewell.

403
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:15,880
Kids don't have to bid farewell.

404
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:18,400
Just cut to the chase.

405
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,910
I know you won't give up the Kunlun Mountains.

406
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,270
I won't make a concession either.

407
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,490
You and I

408
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,600
will eventually fight against each other.

409
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:45,950
But I raised you

410
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:47,170
for about 20 years.

411
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,430
How will you repay me?

412
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,250
Also,

413
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,740
I taught you martial arts.

414
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,890
Are you going to use the martial arts I taught you

415
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,770
to deal with me

416
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:03,250
and kill me?

417
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,490
The person who raised me, taught me

418
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,920
and loved me

419
00:32:14,380 --> 00:32:16,270
is the Sect Leader of the mound-digging, Zhou Qiuhai.

420
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,710
The person who I love and respect

421
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,810
is also the Sect Leader of the mound-digging, Zhou Qiuhai.

422
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:26,270
And my master was killed

423
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,580
a few months ago.

424
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:31,470
You bastard!

425
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,180
I owe you it, Master.

426
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,330
I'll take good care of the mound-digging

427
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,180
to repay you.

428
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,190
Then who is the person standing in front of you?

429
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:06,370
I set fire

430
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:09,520
in your funeral.

431
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:12,670
My master is honest

432
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:13,890
and upright.

433
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,570
For the Penta-sect,

434
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:17,250
he can sacrifice his life.

435
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,810
How could he kill his fellows because of the treasure

436
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,120
in the Kunlun Mountains?

437
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,010
You are not my master.

438
00:33:24,430 --> 00:33:26,070
You are my enemy who killed my master.

439
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,980
But the fact is that Tian Long

440
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:31,570
is Zhou Qiuhai.

441
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:32,460
I don't care.

442
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:34,720
I only know Zhou Qiuhai.

443
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,540
I think

444
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,060
that's all

445
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,200
for our conversation.

446
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,550
And our fate has ended.

447
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
From now on,

448
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:00,180
only one of us

449
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,650
can survive.

450
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,880
Okay.

451
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:19,070
Well,

452
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,800
it has a beginning and an end.

453
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:27,429
But let me tell you,

454
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:31,840
you are useless.

455
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:39,530
You'll know whether I'm useful

456
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:41,120
when we meet.

457
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:16,820
You're here.

458
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,360
Are you okay?

459
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,050
Am I useless?

460
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,410
How can a weak person

461
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,880
dare to face everything

462
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,930
alone?

463
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,460
You mean I'm weak?

464
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:40,850
It's not easy to say goodbye to the past,

465
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,690
especially to the past self.

466
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,820
Luckily, I don't have to say goodbye to you.

467
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:57,770
Yunqi.

468
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,070
Promise me

469
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:01,260
no matter what happens,

470
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,770
we must be together.

471
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:03,820
OK?

472
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,130
I promise.

473
00:36:07,530 --> 00:36:08,440
Things happened in the past

474
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:09,980
ended yesterday.

475
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,170
Things happened in the future

476
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,350
start from today.

477
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:18,980
Tomorrow,

478
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,620
I'll be new Wu Shuang.

479
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,100
My first request

480
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,870
is to be optimistic and strong

481
00:36:26,290 --> 00:36:27,300
and never follow others blindly.

482
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,770
I won't follow my master blindly anymore.

483
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,960
I won't follow you blindly either.

484

in the future.

490

has always been a paradise of the Yu family.

517
00:38:06,330 --> 00:38:07,300
I'm afraid it's hard for them

518
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,100
to accept this decision.

519
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,050
They refused to leave

520
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,860
because they had to obey the rules of the Penta-sect.

521
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,000
Now the Penta-sect has been disbanded.

522
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,390
It might be a good thing

523
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:21,200
to have another choice for them.

524
00:38:21,910 --> 00:38:23,000
Yesterday, you and brother

525
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,640
really cared about them.

526
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,470
Are you afraid?

527
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:33,290
With you by my side,

528
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,470
I'm afraid of nothing.

529
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,300
Sharpen it.

530
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,400
Brother Ding.

531
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:24,530
Don't do it.

532
00:39:24,990 --> 00:39:27,010
You've been protecting this place in disguise for generations.

533
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,690
You deserve my respect.

534
00:39:35,490 --> 00:39:36,370
I, Ding Yunqi, am

535
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,350
the son of the 27th Heaven Official

536
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,480
Ding Yuanshan.

537
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,170
According to my father's final wish, I'm telling you

538
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,310
the Penta-sect has been disbanded.

539
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:46,030
From now on,

540
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,500
you don't have to obey the rules of the Penta-sect

541
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,560
and guard the gate of the headquarters.

542
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,950
You

543
00:39:50,950 --> 00:39:51,910
are free.

544
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,270
Brother Ding.

545
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,070
Are you chasing us away?

546
00:39:57,120 --> 00:39:57,920
No.

547
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,410
Someone will send troops to attack here soon.

548
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:02,540
You are the leader.

549
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,090
Take your people away.

550
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,570
I don't want any of you to be in danger.

551
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:10,230
From the day the Yu family existed,

552
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,710
we were born for the Heaven Official of the Penta-sect.

553
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,480
This is our destiny.

554
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:18,120
We long for a war.

555
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:19,760
Everyone in the Yu family

556
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,150
thinks the same.

557
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,630
Shiqi.

558
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,370
You've been here for hundreds of years.

559
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,850
Life in this place cannot be called as life.

560
00:40:32,190 --> 00:40:33,450
Even if you don't want to,

561
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:36,310
you have to think for your people

562
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,320
and your descendants.

563
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:41,010
You should take them out

564
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,780
to see the outside world.

565
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:44,790
They

566
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,900
shouldn't be buried with the rules of the Penta-sect

567
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,750
or sacrifice their lives for the so-called Kunlun Mountains.

568
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,250
Take them out.

569
00:40:56,050 --> 00:40:58,100
The ancestors of the Yu family kept their promises,

570
00:40:58,570 --> 00:41:00,330
but it locked countless people's lives.

571
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:02,010
Shiqi. Shijiu.

572
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:03,610
I understand

573
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,160
your loyalty and courage.

574
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,670
But the rules of the Penta-sect

575
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:08,020
can't harm anyone anymore.

576
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:12,760
Don't worry.

577
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,440
From now on,

578
00:41:14,950 --> 00:41:16,370
I'll guard the gate of the headquarters.

579
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:18,560
As long as I'm here,

580
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,950
I won't let any thief

581
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,630
enter this place.

582
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:24,730
Don't worry.
