[Ancestral Virtue Leaves A Mark]

5
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,050
How could there be a man

6
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,250
in Dengkun Pavilion?

7
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,200
He must have used the mover's way

8
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:24,480
to come here alone.

9
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,329
His relationship with mountain movers

10
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:28,660
must be extraordinary.

11
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:29,810
Or

12
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:32,140
he has a close relationship

13
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,290
with Leader of Mountain-moving Sect.

14
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,010
It seems

15
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:42,090
he's here to take refuge.

16
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,430
Take refuge?

17
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,450
He must have been chased and injured.

18
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,780
That's why he came here.

19
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,910
[I was hurt by Tian Long. Go save my family!]

20
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,890
Yuanshan, Lao Beifeng.

21
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,120
I was hurt by Tian Long.

22
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,840
Go save my family!

23
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:16,890
Shou Wujiang.

24
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:27,440
No wonder Shou Wujiang has been missing for more than ten years.

25
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,440
But...

26
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,420
But who is Tian Long?

27
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,610
Wait for me here.

28
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,950
Don't touch anything.

29
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,260
Are they all in?

30
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:56,460
Yes.

31
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,630
Let's go.

32
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,310
I was wondering who it was.

33
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,740
Sect Leader Zhou.

34
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,730
We always meet.

35
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,070
What?

36
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,460
Are you taking the disciples

37
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,390
out for a picnic?

38
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:32,990
I knew it.

39
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,690
Why is it getting more and more weird?

40
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:38,870
San.

41
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,350
What are you doing?

42
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,320
Sect Leader Zhou.

43
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,750
I, Sun Laosan,

44
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,350
am an honest person.

45
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,780
I can't perform,

46
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,470
but I have human virtues.

47
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,050
Earlier,

48
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,860
when my men and I

49
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:54,610
just arrived in Shanghai,

50
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,130
you set up the Xunfeng Formation to treat us.

51
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,700
Just now,

52
00:04:58,990 --> 00:05:00,210
you attacked my men.

53
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,760
If I owe a favor,

54
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,230
I have to pay it back.

55
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,360
If there is revenge,

56
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,710
I must also revenge.

57
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,180
Today,

58
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,270
I

59
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,590
set up a formation to treat you.

60
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:13,940
San.

61
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,920
You think too much.

62
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,280
The Xunfeng Formation was prepared for Ding Yuanshan.

63
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,550
You were unlucky to run into it.

64
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,580
And you said

65
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,300
I hurt your men.

66
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,750
Do you have evidence?

67
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,360
You...

68
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:31,830
don't, right?

69
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:35,450
You said you want to treat me.

70
00:05:36,409 --> 00:05:37,080
OK.

71
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,270
Let's see if you can do it.

72
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,280
Sect Leader Zhou.

73
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,830
I can't do anything to you.

74
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,270
At most,

75
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:46,450
it is a show of skills in front of you,

76
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:47,250
so that you can

77
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,950
see our gold touching skills.

78
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,270
OK.

79
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,130
Let's see how much gold touching skills you still have.

80
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,580
You wanted to enter Dengkun Pavilion.

81
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,480
Were you looking for something

82
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:15,280
or someone?

83
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:18,380
Someone.

84
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,040
Go in.

85
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:54,670
Biao.

86
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,680
You stay here.

87
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,780
You can't go.

88
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,800
Why can't I?

89
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,760
Brother told us to guard here.

90
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,110
Auntie Hei.

91
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,540
Father.

92
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:30,740
There are words

93
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,460
left on uncle's clothes.

94
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,380
[I was hurt by Tian Long. Go save my family!]

95
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,900
You must still recognize

96
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,600
uncle's handwriting.

97
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,360
San.

98
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,450
Did my brother Wujiang really

99
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,330
teach you this rudimentary net formation?

100
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:27,880
Zhou.

101
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:29,440
Don’t ask for trouble.

102
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:30,870
It's good enough

103
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,970
I can make this net overnight.

104
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:34,520
If you don't like it,

105
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,450
it's because I'm not good at learning.

106
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,380
It has nothing to do with my master.

107
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,020
This time,

108
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,110
my fellows

109
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,810
brought all the equipment.

110
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,770
I didn't expect to use it on you.

111
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,410
Even if it's simple,

112
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:48,130
it

113
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:49,530
can still work.

114
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:51,610
Please forgive me.

115
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,480
Don't try to scare me in the name of Dragon Flight.

116
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:58,880
Even if Shou Wujiang taught you that,

117
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,390
I don't

118
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,410
believe you can learn it

119
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,720
since you don't look like that way.

120
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,870
Zhou.

121
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,420
It's useless to insult me.

122
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:10,260
Are you not convinced?

123
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,230
Just try it.

124
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,960
Okay.

125
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:15,010
Xuewen.

126
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,640
What's the trick to this shabby net?

127
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,840
It's not a shabby net.

128
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,220
Dragon Flight is the ultimate move of Gold Touching Sect,

129
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,280
the deadly formation of Penta-sect.

130
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:26,640
Xingchen.

131
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:27,770
Yes.

132
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:29,790
Position of Black Tortoise.

133
00:11:30,130 --> 00:11:30,630
Break!

134
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:31,700
Candle Dragon!

135
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,610
Position of Black Tortoise. Break!

136
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:34,240
Yes.

137
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,080
I advise you not to move.

138
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,390
Why don't you listen to me?

139
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,170
Defend.

140
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,410
Stop.

141
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:40,770
Pigtail.

142
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,500
I told you not to move.

143
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:49,290
Old man.

144
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,130
Did I embarrass my master?

145
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,900
Well done, San.

146
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:55,550
Interesting.

147
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,320
You are

148
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,710
knowledgeable.

149
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,440
You must know the mystery of Dragon Flight.

150
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,540
Even a little vibration

151
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:07,350
will trigger a new round of flying needles.

152
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:08,530
And the flying needles

153
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,540
will get smaller

154
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,290
but

155
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,680
stronger.

156
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:13,270
Master.

157
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,200
This needle is poisonous.

158
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:17,430
Pigtail.

159
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,340
What are you talking about?

160
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:21,170
I'm not that mean.

161
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,490
I won't use poison.

162
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:24,490
At most,

163
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:28,460
it's been too long since I used this flying needles. They're rusted.

164
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:32,550
San.

165
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:34,790
What exactly do you want?

166
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:37,930
I'm not sure.

167
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:39,360
Yunqi said

168
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,220
no one can cross Nanshan.

169
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:43,210
You can't come out anyway.

170
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:44,770
Let's have more fun.

171
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,220
How dare you be rude to my master!

172
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,990
How dare you!

173
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,340
I'm talking to your master. None of your business.

174
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:58,720
Aiwu.

175
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,850
Keep an eye on them.

176
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,310
I'll ask Yunqi for an idea.

177
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,040
What if they don't behave?

178
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,130
What are you afraid of?

179
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,350
We have Dragon Flight.

180
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,020
Okay.

181
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,290
Master.

182
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,660
Is it as mysterious as he said?

183
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:18,140
I don't know.

184
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,500
But there must be a solution.

185
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:12,150
Come here, Fengling.

186
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:20,950
Brother.

187
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,170
Kneel.

188
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Kowtow to father.

189
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,200
Father?

190
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:38,000
Yes.

191
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,160
Listen up, everyone.

192
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:11,730
If anyone breaks in,

193
00:16:12,570 --> 00:16:14,580
we'll attack them according to our plan.

194
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,880
If the enemy retreats, we retreat.

195
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,350
We're only responsible for defense.

196
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:18,150
Understand?

197
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:19,330
Yes.

198
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,550
I'll go check Brother.

199
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,490
Should some people go with you?

200
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,710
No.

201
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:39,870
[Ancestral Virtue Leaves A Mark]

202
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:36,800
Yunqi.

203
00:16:37,890 --> 00:16:39,490
I was wrong about Uncle Ding.

204
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,250
Without you,

205
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,390
Fengling and I wouldn't have met my father

206
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,390
for the last time,

207
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,960
let alone know

208
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,300
who killed our father.

209
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:49,540
Thank you.

210
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,880
I'll keep this in mind.

211
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,390
From now on,

212
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,300
if you need anything,

213
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,330
I'll do my best to help you.

214
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,040
You are...

215
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,930
Young Leader of Gold Touching Sect?

216
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,060
No wonder you know Penta-sect so well.

217
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,569
I know what you're thinking.

218
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,380
Gold Touching Sect's Soul Pursuit Order,

219
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,920
right?

220
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,530
Yes.

221
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,430
Fengling.

222
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:28,660
Take off the amulet on your neck.

223
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,100
Brother, this...

224
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,230
Yes.

225
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,430
This is Gold Touching Sect's Soul Pursuit Order.

226
00:17:51,430 --> 00:17:52,100
Yunqi.

227
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,250
It's yours now.

228
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:02,520
Brother.

229
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,350
You gave this to me as an amulet.

230
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,330
I've been wearing it for more than ten years. I...

231
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:11,550
I understand.

232
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,760
It's normal

233
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,670
you don't want to give it out.

234
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:16,670
No hurry.

235
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,260
My Lady.

236
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:23,870
Fengling!

237
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:24,650
Fengling!

238
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,380
Brother Luo.

239
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:26,880
It's OK.

240
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,560
What

241
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,910
did you call me?

242
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:38,990
Brother Luo.

243
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:41,230
Shouldn't I call you that?

244
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:46,110
Yes.

245
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:47,960
You should.

246
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:52,500
We'll talk about

247
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:54,220
the Soul Pursuit Order later.

248
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,550
Would we send Uncle...?

249
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:00,690
Bury my father

250
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:03,410
in Mountain-moving Town.

251
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:06,740
Wu Shuang.

252
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,340
Please find a good place for my father.

253
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:11,900
No problem.

254
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,850
Brother Luo.

255
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,850
I did something

256
00:19:21,650 --> 00:19:23,050
and made you suffer a lot.

257
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,870
I hope you won't hate me.

258
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:26,940
I won't.

259
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,880
I would have understood if I knew you are

260
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:32,340
Young Leader of Gold Touching Sect.

261
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:34,620
Thank you.

262
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:09,800
Let's go.

263
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,350
This place is going to fall.

264
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,030
Let's go.

265
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,170
Yunqi.

266
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:28,210
Why did it fall down suddenly?

267
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,420
It's the alcove bed.

268
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:32,980
When I stepped on it,

269
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,380
I found something wrong.

270
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,500
When Uncle Shou Wujiang

271
00:21:37,550 --> 00:21:38,950
was removed from the bed,

272
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,150
the weight was gone.

273
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,940
The mechanism was triggered.

274
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:48,510
Are you okay, Yunqi?

275
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,160
Master!

276
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:04,430
Master!

277
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,090
Master!

278
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:16,820
Yunqi.

279
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,600
What's going on?

280
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,860
Brother Luo

281
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:25,720
is the son of Uncle Shou Wujiang.

282
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,930
Sun Laosan is really not good at learning.

283
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,970
He actually put this mechanism's hub

284
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,730
outside his control zone.

285
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:55,880
Master.

286
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,520
You mean

287
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,110
Dragon Flight

288
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,840
is controlled by this thing.

289
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,800
That's right.

290
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,610
If we destroy

291
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,240
or control this hub,

292
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:06,950
the mechanism will be broken.

293
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:07,560
Master.

294
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:08,480
I'll go.

295
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:10,030
Where are you going?

296
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:11,880
Your arm is injured.

297
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,010
How are you going?

298
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,230
Besides,

299
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,990
you don't know how to dismantle this mechanism.

300
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,030
Wu Shuang.

301
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:24,230
Master, I...

302
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:26,670
Master.

303
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:29,480
I...

304
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:32,290
I'll go.

305
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,640
-Master! Master! -Master.

306
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,310
I'll go.

307
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:35,110
No.

308
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:37,840
You've never been good at martial arts.

309
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,100
I don't think you'll be able to come back.

310
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:41,530
I'll go.

311
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:42,710
Master.

312
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:44,350
What's wrong?

313
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,110
You think I'm old?

314
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,170
Set up the Breaking Thunder first.

315
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:53,710
Master.

316
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,390
Given the current situation,

317
00:23:55,390 --> 00:23:56,990
they just want to control us.

318
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,370
They wouldn't kill us.

319
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,770
Didn't you hear what Sun Laosan said?

320
00:24:01,270 --> 00:24:03,200
The raid and the gunshot last night

321
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:06,310
proved that this Mountain-moving Town isn't safe.

322
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,450
There must be a lot of people hiding in the dark.

323
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:09,970
Be careful not to be destroyed.

324
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:10,550
Yes.

325
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,250
Zhou Qiuhai is here.

326
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,060
Yes.

327
00:24:16,180 --> 00:24:17,910
He's trapped by Dragon Flight.

328
00:24:18,370 --> 00:24:19,100
Brother San.

329
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:19,960
Wu Shuang.

330
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:21,600
You can't blame me for this.

331
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,260
Your master

332
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:23,950
brought a large group of people here.

333
00:24:23,950 --> 00:24:25,340
I have to stop him.

334
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,320
How is my master?

335
00:24:28,530 --> 00:24:29,660
Your master is fine.

336
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:30,630
Your senior with braids

337
00:24:30,630 --> 00:24:32,830
was hit by the formation. But he's fine.

338
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,950
So he can't put up anymore.

339
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:36,510
Biao.

340
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,290
Send Black Feather Team to Nanshan to help the Gold Touchers.

341
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,690
Auntie Hei, you go.

342
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,170
What are you doing?

343
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:58,220
It depends on your master.

344
00:25:00,450 --> 00:25:01,500
Eight-faced Heavenly Thunder!

345
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,300
Bomb!

346
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,930
Dragon in the Field!

347
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:50,760
Master! Master!

348
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,070
Master!

349
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:55,770
Fight with them!

350
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:57,860
Senior.

351
00:25:58,070 --> 00:25:58,660
Master!

352
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,570
Breaking Thunder!

353
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:04,200
Bomb!

354
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,170
Bomb!

355
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:11,010
Bomb!

356
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,360
Biao.

357
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:21,190
Will you follow me to Nanshan?

358
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:27,730
Fengling.

359
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:28,770
Fengling.

360
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:29,740
You...

361
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,200
Brother San.

362
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,060
Stay here with them.

363
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,990
I'll take a look.

364
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,080
Brother San, follow him.

365
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,330
Don't let anything happen.

366
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:41,960
Okay.

367
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,090
You go too.

368
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,830
Yes.

369
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,640
-Master! -Master!

370
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:14,890
Shoot!

371
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:21,770
Bomb!

372
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,600
-Stop. -Wu Shuang.

373
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,280
Stop! Tell them to stop!

374
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:49,620
Stop!

375
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:52,640
Senior.

376
00:27:52,940 --> 00:27:53,940
Wu Shuang is here.

377
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,040
Stop!

378
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,520
Auntie Hei. Auntie Hei.

379
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:07,680
Master!

380
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:09,370
Master, are you alright?

381
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,330
I'm fine.

382
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:15,600
Auntie Hei.

383
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:16,960
Auntie Hei.

384
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:21,710
Auntie Hei.

385
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,360
My lady.

386
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:28,430
Don't be willful.

387
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,450
Listen...

388
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,010
Listen to Master.

389
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,040
Auntie Hei.

390
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:38,670
I can't...

391
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:40,480
Auntie Hei.

392
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,830
protect you anymore.

393
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,570
Black Feather Team.

394
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,380
Kill them!

395
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,680
Kill them all!

396
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:49,150
-Yes. -Yes.

397
00:29:58,510 --> 00:29:59,310
Don't move.

398
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:06,580
How dare you!

399
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,510
Come on, kill me!

400
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:12,500
No one can threaten me with death.

401
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:13,680
I'm not afraid anymore.

402
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,020
We can die together.

403
00:30:19,810 --> 00:30:21,470
Brother San is here. Let's go.

404
00:30:25,350 --> 00:30:26,020
Fengling.

405
00:30:30,310 --> 00:30:31,060
Stop!

406
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,310
Don't stop!

407
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:39,420
Shoot!

408
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,680
Shoot!

409
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:44,540
Give me the gun.

410
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:45,970
He Biao.

411
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:47,330
Auntie Hei is dead.

412
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:49,050
Auntie Hei is dead.

413
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:50,090
I want revenge!

414
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:52,360
Give me the gun!

415
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:55,630
He Biao, give me the gun!

416
00:30:55,670 --> 00:30:57,770
Shoot! I want revenge!

417
00:31:00,210 --> 00:31:02,020
Give me the gun!

418
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,170
Auntie Hei is dead. I want revenge.

419
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:08,860
Fengling!

420
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:10,190
Fengling! Fengling!

421
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:11,210
Fengling!

422
00:31:11,420 --> 00:31:12,010
Brother!

423
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:13,730
They killed Auntie Hei. Auntie Hei is dead.

424
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,580
You killed them to avenge her. -Calm down.

425
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,340
Calm down.

426
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,610
How can I calm down?

427
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,580
Why should I?

428
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,810
Auntie Hei just saved me.

429
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:23,650
If it weren't her,

430
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,030
I would have died today.

431
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,820
Brother, it would've been me.

432
00:31:28,430 --> 00:31:29,150
Brother.

433
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,540
Did you hear me?

434
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,720
I want revenge!

435
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:35,400
Answer me, Brother.

436
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,930
Auntie Hei is dead. I want to avenge her.

437
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,420
Brother.

438
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,400
You're not going to avenge Auntie Hei?

439
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:55,310
When I came down from Commander Hu's execution ground,

440
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,360
I swore

441
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
I won't let anyone

442
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,510
threaten me with their lives.

443
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,040
Whoever wants to kill me will be killed first.

444
00:32:03,170 --> 00:32:04,570
Brother Jiutian is gone.

445
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,950
Auntie Hei died in my arms just now.

446
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,420
Are you so indifferent?

447
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,260
Fine.

448
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,870
Since you're so indifferent, I'll do it myself.

449
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:18,710
I'll make them pay double.

450
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:19,830
I'll do it myself.

451
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,170
Fengling.

452
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,400
Brother Luo.

453
00:32:32,730 --> 00:32:34,260
It was a misunderstanding.

454
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,380
Help me over.

455
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,340
Uncle Zhou.

456
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,020
Are you okay?

457
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:56,250
Yes.

458
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,260
I was hit by a needle.

459
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,620
I'm trapped in this mechanism.

460
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,750
It's embarrassing.

461
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,000
I'm glad you're fine.

462
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,410
How are our casualties?

463
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,570
Nine of us were shot by the flying needles.

464
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,610
But none of them is serious.

465
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:11,870
Everyone else is fine.

466
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:14,910
Xingchen.

467
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:15,820
Yes.

468
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,010
Although you are eager to protect me,

469
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,770
you gave the order to attack without permission.

470
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,410
You still have to be punished.

471
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:23,380
Return to Mound-digging Region and reflect for three days.

472
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:23,970
Yes.

473
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,620
Brother.

474
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,250
What are you doing?

475
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:34,110
Untie me now.

476
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,530
Yunqi.

477
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,320
I'll be honest with you.

478
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,970
It's dark and we are short in time.

479
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,610
I'm doing an irreversible job.

480
00:33:41,610 --> 00:33:42,910
Once Dragon Flight is activated,

481
00:33:42,910 --> 00:33:43,970
it can't be broken.

482
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,270
No?

483
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,910
Then what about my master?

484
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,930
Wu Shuang, give me your Jingang Rope.

485
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:51,560
Let me try.

486
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:55,810
Be careful.

487
00:33:56,870 --> 00:33:58,620
Yunqi, be careful.

488
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:02,710
Flying needles will be launched whenever the net is vibrated.

489
00:34:03,530 --> 00:34:04,290
Don’t worry.

490
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:06,430
Zhou.

491
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:08,199
Did you see that?

492
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,840
Yunqi is such a loyal friend.

493
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,600
If he helps you break Dragon Flight,

494
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:13,190
just hand over the Soul Pursuit Order.

495
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:13,949
Got it?

496
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:19,159
If the relief is conditional,

497
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,550
I will never agree.

498
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:22,730
Uncle.

499
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,400
Don't listen to him.

500
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:26,000
I wouldn't do that.

501
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,360
Defend yourselves.

502
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:30,760
I'll come over now.

503
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:31,630
Yunqi.

504
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,719
Be careful.

505
00:34:32,850 --> 00:34:33,520
Defend!

506
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:21,120
Stop!

507
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:24,860
Master.

508
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:28,680
Uncle.

509
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:29,690
I'm sorry.

510
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:31,540
Yunqi.

511
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:35,040
Mount Digging Sect will keep this in mind.

512
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:37,290
Don't say that, Uncle.

513
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:38,480
That's different.

514
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:40,510
I won't ask you for favors with this.

515
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,800
We should do things

516
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,420
as always.

517
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:45,940
Good man.

518
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:47,750
But we'll

519
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,200
go our separate ways.

520
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,070
Whether to disband Penta-sect

521
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:52,400
or Mound-digging Sect,

522
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,060
we still have things to deal with.

523
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,180
How about this?

524
00:36:57,830 --> 00:36:59,230
On the 15th of this month,

525
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,310
you come to the headquarters of Mound-digging Sect.

526
00:37:01,310 --> 00:37:03,790
Let's settle all things together, okay?

527
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,910
That's exactly what I want.

528
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,870
Okay.

529
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:09,200
I'll wait for you.

530
00:37:10,090 --> 00:37:10,640
Master.

531
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:11,870
Are you hurt badly?

532
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,920
I'm fine.

533
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:19,250
Yunqi.

534
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,380
I shall take my leave.

535
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,750
Let's go.

536
00:37:26,390 --> 00:37:26,930
Let's go.

537
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:33,990
Go.

538
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:04,190
[Deshun Restaurant]

539
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,560
Fengling.

540
00:38:25,310 --> 00:38:26,320
During the treasure hunt,

541
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,250
if anything unexpected happens,

542
00:38:28,670 --> 00:38:30,330
you can call for help anytime.

543
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,010
How about this?

544
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:33,330
I'll send you a team.

545
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,020
As long as you show the pattern,

546
00:38:36,570 --> 00:38:38,500
the team will contact you

547
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,090
and listen to your orders.

548
00:38:41,190 --> 00:38:42,120
Will they see it?

549
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,250
Don't worry, they will.

550
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:47,030
Only you and I know about this.

551
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,820
Don't tell anyone, including your brother.

552
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,190
Yes, Your Ladyship.

553
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,240
Greetings, Young Leader.

554
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
Didn't Yunqi disband us?

555
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,600
There won't be Gold Touching Sect anymore,

556
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,930
let alone Young Leader.

557
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:23,500
Laosan.

558
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:25,790
If you don't mind,

559
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,550
how about we treat each other as brothers?

560
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,690
I'll listen to you.

561
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,470
Listen to Brother.

562
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,360
Good brothers.

563
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,000
Biao.

564
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:37,280
So

565
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,020
we are a family from now on?

566
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:41,830
Yes.

567
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:42,910
Well,

568
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,700
you can't eat more than Brother San, can you?

569
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:48,550
We are about

570
00:39:49,490 --> 00:39:50,250
the same.

571
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,680
What should we do

572
00:39:54,110 --> 00:39:55,510
with such a large family?

573
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:56,950
Nothing.

574
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:57,810
Well, Biao.

575
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,020
I'll take care of cooking.

576
00:40:01,990 --> 00:40:02,540
Brother,

577
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:04,720
we

578
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:06,640
were raised by our master

579
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:08,350
and followed him around.

580
00:40:08,590 --> 00:40:09,890
Before Master left,

581
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,400
he left us an order.

582
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,700
No matter what,

583
00:40:12,830 --> 00:40:13,880
no matter where,

584
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:15,320
we'll risk our life...

585
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,250
to protect and follow Master Ding.

586
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,190
We gold diggers keep our words.

587
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,010
Since we promised Master,

588
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,030
our life

589
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,930
belongs to the Ding family.

590
00:40:24,650 --> 00:40:25,510
But now,

591
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,270
Master Ding is gone.

592
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,950
We promised Master Ding...

593
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,590
to protect Yunqi.

594
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,150
So,

595
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,830
we'll accompany Yunqi to finish what he wants to do.

596
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,510
By then,

597
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,520
no matter how many lives we have,

598
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,380
it's all yours.

599
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,650
Gold diggers worship loyalty.

600
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,550
That's what we should do.

601
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:51,010
Next,

602
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:53,240
we'll do our best to help Yunqi.

603
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:55,920
From now on, his business is our business.

604
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:56,630
I believe

605
00:40:57,730 --> 00:40:58,940
my father's soul

606
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,460
will feel comforted

607
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,220
when they see us.

608
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:06,670
Brothers,

609
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,160
Penta-sect has been disbanded.

610
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:11,850
From now on, you don't need to keep your promise.

611
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,700
I don't know what will happen

612
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,080
in the future.

613
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,800
I won't implicate you.

614
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:18,810
Yunqi.

615
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:20,360
When we're together,

616
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:21,830
we dare to risk our lives.

617
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,290
This has nothing to do with Penta-sect.

618
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:26,620
San is right.

619
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,510
This has nothing to do with Penta-sect.

620
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,440
What we need to do

621
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:30,860
is for our brothers.

622
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:33,590
Stop making excuses.

623
00:41:33,590 --> 00:41:35,050
If you continue to refuse,

624
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,760
they will be disappointed.

625
00:41:40,650 --> 00:41:41,280
Thank you.

626
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:42,750
Aiwu.

627
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,470
Take our men to dinner.

628
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,610
Yes, brother.

629
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:47,680
Guys, let's go.

630
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:08,750
Yunqi.

631
00:42:09,710 --> 00:42:12,020
Fengling was so grief and angry that she acted like that.

632
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:13,150
Please forgive her.

633
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:14,750
I understand. It's normal.

634
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:16,390
I understand.

635
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,200
Brother.

636
00:42:19,010 --> 00:42:21,140
I want to hear about Dengkun Pavilion.

637
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,570
When I was young,

638
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,210
my father told me

639
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,600
the safest place in the world

640
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,320
is Dengkun Pavilion.

641
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,840
So when you mentioned

642
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:31,890
Dengkun Pavilion to me,

643
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:32,750
I was wondering

644
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:34,280
if my father is inside.

645
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,050
Did uncle mention about Tian Long?

646
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:38,140
Never.

647
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:43,700
Tian Long

648
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,420
seems to have a deep connection with Penta-sect.

649
00:42:46,420 --> 00:42:47,090
Besides,

650
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:49,360
he can hurt Uncle.

651
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:51,540
That means he's very skilled.

652
00:42:54,310 --> 00:42:55,530
Yunqi, Brother.

653
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,250
No matter how powerful this Tian Long is,

654
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,220
I will find him

655
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,490
and avenge my master.

656
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,040
Go back?

657
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:14,890
Yes.

658
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:17,800
Xingchen was impulsive today.

659
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,500
He ordered an attack and caused casualties to both sides.

660
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,360
The hostility is getting deeper.

661
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,250
The death of Auntie Hei

662
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:29,800
makes Chu Fengling hate us even more.

663
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:30,850
At this time,

664
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,320
we are no match for Black Feather Team.

665
00:43:33,630 --> 00:43:34,300
So,

666
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,280
I want to retreat to the headquarters

667
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,690
to reduce the casualties of both parties.

668
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:42,320
Then I should be with you.

669
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,370
No.

670
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:45,700
By staying by Yunqi's side,

671
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,390
you can be more helpful.

672
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:49,730
-But... -Okay.

673
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,370
Did you enter Dengkun Pavilion?

674
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:55,000
Yes.

675
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:56,720
Did you find anything?

676
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:57,560
Master,

677
00:43:57,900 --> 00:43:59,160
you would never expect

678
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,000
Uncle Shou Wujiang's body

679
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:02,340
is in Dengkun Pavilion.

680
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,410
In Dengkun Pavilion?

681
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:11,590
Yes.

682
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,270
Uncle Shou Wujiang was ambushed

683
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:14,910
so he hid in Dengkun Pavilion.

684
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:16,340
In the end, he passed away

685
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,660
in Dengkun Pavilion.

686
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,800
Do you know who did it?

687
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,910
It's a man called Tian Long.
