I can catch up with him if I try my best.

51
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:50,220
I said follow, not catch up with him.

52
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,740
Follow him.

97
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,610
It's not easy for you

to dress in white and wash it yourself, right?

99
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,020
And you are

100

quite good at throwing leaves.

101
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,680
How about teaching me?

102

Do you want to learn it? It's in our family.

103

I'll teach you if you want to be my son.

We're all martial artists.

Being sharp-tongued isn't enough.

108
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,010
How about

Keep your voice down. Don't let them hear you.

The thing is it's raining.

125

when are you in charge?

137
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,670
I'll let him go just because you ask me to?

138

No, I won't.

139
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:00,360
If you ask me to let him go,

140

I'll kill him.

That's it.

Tie them up and search.

146
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,590
Don't respond.

147
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:21,010
How did you know I was here?

148
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,510

157

You are indeed

158
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,020
the best-looking in the world.

159
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,070
May I ask...

160
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,840
I'm a little embarrassed

161
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:56,970
to ask this in front of so many people,

162
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:59,030
but have you been promised to anyone?

163
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:01,420
If not,

164
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:02,940
can I marry you?

165
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,130
Brat, you're quite arrogant.

166
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,140
Who are you?

167

I am

00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,370
Luo Jiutian.

169
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:14,070
-It's from the poem "One might believe it was the Milky Way fallen from the sky". -Luo Jiutian.

170
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:16,670
Well, I fell on the ground 20 years ago.

171
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,530
No wonder you look so annoying.

172
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,750
Did you fall from the sky?

173
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,040
Thank you for your understanding. It's quite a shame.

00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,250
Do you dare to come down and say something?

176
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,750
Why not?

177
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:37,400
It's dangerous. Don't go.

178
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,210
I must go.

179
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,120
Wu Shuang, I have a request.

180
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,430
So courteous.

181
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,080
Keep this for me.

182
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,770
I'll pick it up myself.

183
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:08,940
This...

184
00:11:10,430 --> 00:11:12,020
Is this the legendary...

185
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,790
Anyway, it's very important.

186
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,160
OK.

187
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,790
I'll help you with this.

188
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:23,830
Yunqi.

189
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:25,720
Thank you.

190
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,470
I live in Taiyi Private Bank in Shunxin Alley.

191
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,020
Goodbye.

192
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:34,810
Wait.

193
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:36,970
Miss,

194
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,400
if you don't mind,

195
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:40,620
can you give me the time of a burning joss stick?

196
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,680
I want to marry you.

197
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:45,830
Well,

198
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:50,500
it's easy for you to come down, but it's hard to go up.

199
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:53,520
It's not that hard.

200
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,120
Bravo.

201
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:07,990
Really?

202
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,360
Watch them.

203
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,320
Watch him.

204
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:46,810
-Go. -Go.

205
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,610
Young Master, are you alright?

206
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,210
The smoke

207
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,450
made me choke like I was pregnant.

208
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:05,590
Where are they?

209
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:08,280
Find them!

210
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,410
-They've run away. -Go find them.

211
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,960
Go after them!

212
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,020
-Over here. Over there. -Hurry.

213
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,400
Where did she say

214
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,700
she live?

215
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,730
Taiyi Private Bank, right?

216
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:22,890
Young Master.

217
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,080
How shall we explain the mess

218
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,550
when we are back home?

219
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:37,470
Biaozi, why didn't you pick me up?

220
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:40,070
The driver was so clumsy today. I got carsick.

221
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,250
I went out to run errands with the director and just came back.

222
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,380
Where is my brother?

223
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,190
Your brother is here.

224
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,550
[Administrative Commissioner for Her Ladyship Chu Fengling]

225
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,180
Brother.

226
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:51,620
Did you miss me?

227
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:53,760
-Yes. -Really?

228
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,400
I miss you too.

229
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,930
Why did you lose weight? Tired?

230
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,260
Yes. I went to several places

231
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,860
with Her Ladyship every day.

232
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:01,950
My feet were about to break.

233
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,420
Right? Where did you travel to?

234
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,020
It was all work. I didn't have time to travel.

235
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,000
Do girls need to work?

236
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,440
Brother, what's that smell?

237
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:18,370
What do you like to eat?

238
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,670
Sweet dumplings.

239
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:21,020
Yes. Here.

240
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:23,790
Still hot.

241
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,220
Don't burn yourself.

242
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,170
Try it.

243
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,470
So good.

244
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,530
I was talking to Auntie Hei on the way back

245
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,090
that I want to have sweet dumplings tomorrow.

246
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:42,860
I didn't expect to be able to have them when I'm back.

247
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,570
Delicious.

248
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,630
I'll buy them for you every day if you like them.

249
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,830
Brother, how do you feel?

250
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,680
I'm fine. I'm rough.

251
00:14:58,350 --> 00:14:59,490
By the way, Yunqi,

252
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,970
go to Xinyu Hotel next to the train station

253
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,360
and find a man named Yang Aiwu.

254
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,910
Tell him you're sent by Prairie Vulture

255
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:07,110
to pick something up.

256
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:08,740
I'll go then.

257
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,260
Where is my father now?

258
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,020
How is he?

259
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,250
I don't know.

260
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,900
Who knows Master Ding's whereabouts?

261
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,740
The dragon bone

262
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,060
was sent here half a year ago.

263
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,860
I haven't met Master Ding at all.

264
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,060
So he must be alive now.

265
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:25,780
Of course.

266
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,220
Zhou Qiuhai and the police

267
00:15:29,350 --> 00:15:30,480
are trying so hard looking for him.

268
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,490
He must be alive.

269
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:38,590
Going after him.

270
00:15:39,350 --> 00:15:40,550
Going after him, huh?

271
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,530
I told you to follow him.

272
00:15:41,530 --> 00:15:42,870
Did I tell you to intercept him halfway?

273
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:43,760
Did I?

274
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,860
Going after him.

275
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,050
Going after him.

276
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,260
-Brother. -Going after him.

277
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:50,310
Brother.

278
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,060
Brother.

279
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,620
Brother.

280
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,890
After all...

281
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,760
What?

282
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:01,400
I'm teaching him a lesson on behalf of adoptive father.

283
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,360
I'll beat him up today

284
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,750
the way adoptive father beat him up before.

285
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,890
My father never beat me this hard.

286
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,530
Brother, he knows he was wrong.

287
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,630
He knows.

288
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:12,940
Young Master.

289
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:16,430
Easy. Easy.

290
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,000
Move. It hurts.

291
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,740
Inhuman.

292
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,630
You've beat him up, brother.

293
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,600
Calm down.

294
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:35,830
After all, he's not our brother related by blood.

295
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:36,300
You...

296
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,390
Who said that?

297
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,280
Adoptive father treats us as his own.

298
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,210
I just treat him as my real brother.

299
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,140
It's okay that he's always careless.

300
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,860
Now I've given him a chance to train himself.

301
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,590
If he couldn't do such a small thing,

302
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:48,220
how can he succeed in the future?

303
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,830
The situation is complicated, Brother.

304
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,890
You know that.

305
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,490
Brother, don't be angry.

306
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,510
Calm down.

307
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:00,320
Ding Yunqi is so bold.

308
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,920
Tell me what he did.

309
00:17:02,130 --> 00:17:02,840
Brother.

310
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:14,849
Brother.

311

Ding Yunqi's father

312
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,480
is the Kunlun Heaven Official of Penta-sect.

313
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:23,920
Penta-sect?

314
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,990
Penta-sect is a martial arts sect.

315
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,880
It was established during the Northern Song Dynasty.

316
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:29,560
They

317
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,800
only raided the emperors' tombs.

318
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,500
So,

319
00:17:32,950 --> 00:17:35,330
they were also called the Dragon-seeking Penta-sect.

320
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,150
The chief Sect Leader of Penta-sect

321
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:38,880
is the Kunlun Heaven Official.

322

Ding Yuanshan,

is the current Kunlun Heaven Official.

326
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,900
What about the other four sects?

327
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,080
It is said that

328
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:50,590
in recent decades,

329
00:17:50,590 --> 00:17:52,310
Penta-sect have stopped tomb raiding

330
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,950
and turned into other professions.

Zhou Qiuhai in mound-digging

332
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,000
opened a private bank.

The ghoul opened an escort agency.

335
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,060
The other two sects, mountain-demounting and mountain-moving,

336
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,390
are nowhere to be found.

337
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:07,180
Then what is Ding Yuanshan, the Kunlun Heaven Official, doing?

338
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,970
He's said to be in archaeology.

339
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,710
What would he study then?

340
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:11,380
He's still studying

341
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,360
the objects from the tombs.

342

[Taiyi Private Bank]

343
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,630
The package Zhou Qiuhai took

344
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:04,940
contains a fake dragon bone.

345
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,480
What is the dragon bone for?

346

00:30:09,690 --> 00:30:10,950
you even pressed me.

519
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,300
Are you heartless?

520
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:17,080
Be a human.

521
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,230
I feel sick just

522
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,610
standing by you.

523
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:28,370
General.

524
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,370
Please enlighten me.

525
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:32,320
A few days ago,

526
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:33,750
General Sun

527
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,750
stole and destroyed East Tomb

528
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,490
by the hands of tomb raiders.

529
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,520
It aroused great anger in people.

530
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,730
The National Government has specially issued a decree

531
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:43,030
to eliminate tomb raiders all over the country.

532
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:44,170
Once found,

533
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:45,680
you can execute them by shooting

534
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,410
on the spot without reporting.

535
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:51,010
The tomb raiders are really...

536
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,230
Really hateful.

537
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:53,950
But I don't know

538
00:30:53,950 --> 00:30:56,180
what it has to do

539
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,480
with me, who runs a private bank?

540
00:30:58,820 --> 00:30:59,790
If only you do

541
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:02,270
your private bank business honestly, Mr. Zhou.

542
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,990
How should I address you?

543
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:05,750
Mr. Zhou

544
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:06,930
or

545
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,030
Sect Leader Zhou?

546
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,920
If I call you Mr. Zhou,

547
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,180
I'm afraid you might think I'm so blind

548
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,840
as to not have recognized you.

549
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,980
But if I call you Sect Leader Zhou,

550
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,600
given my position,

551
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,280
I can't

552
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,170
just ignore

553
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:34,310
and do nothing about some of the affairs.

554
00:31:34,310 --> 00:31:35,240
So,

555
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,580
I'm in a dilemma.

556
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:38,090
Tell me.

557
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:39,590
What should I call you

558
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,000
in the future?

559
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:48,550
General is really sharp-sighted.

560
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:52,090
I can't hide anything from you.

561
00:31:53,210 --> 00:31:54,090
Fine.

562
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,200
Now that you know who I am,

563
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,630
you should know

564
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:01,190
the brothers of Penta-sect

565
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,870
haven't engaged in tomb raiding for years

566
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,110
and made our livings separately

567
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,060
without stepping into the martial artists community.

568
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,100
Then why did you

569
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,820
come all the way to Shanghai

570
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:14,100
to clean up the house, Sect Leader Zhou?

571
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,750
Alright, to be honest,

572
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,600
I'm looking for a ghoul

573
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,760
to deal with some family matters.

574
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,890
I'm here today

575
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,370
to help you with your family matters.

576
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,260
Look at your physique.

577
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,620
Obviously

578
00:32:40,540 --> 00:32:41,940
you are a martial artist.

579
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:46,000
Don't look so fierce.

580
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:49,910
Rumor has it that you quit, right?

581
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:51,700
Doing business, right?

582
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,020
Then do it well.

583
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,450
I'm telling you, in many business aspects,

584
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,710
we can make connections with each other.

585
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:00,310
Have you ever been down a tomb?

586
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,610
Have you seen ghosts?

587
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:07,400
When you went down the tomb,

588
00:33:07,420 --> 00:33:08,680
did you really meet the

589
00:33:08,730 --> 00:33:09,480
Zombie?

590
00:33:10,030 --> 00:33:11,290
Not something to eat.

591
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,600
It's all hairy.

592
00:33:18,890 --> 00:33:21,820
I guess you haven't seen it since you're still young.

593
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:24,390
This is good.

594
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:26,610
Which dynasty was it from?

595
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,860
Brought out from the tomb, right?

596
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,920
If you are really bored,

597
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:36,120
just think about what you'll put in your tomb.

598
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,990
How dare you.

599
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:46,100
I think you don't know who I am.

600
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,710
I'll let you know

601
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:49,970
who you are in a second.

602
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:53,120
It makes me sick standing by you, too.

603
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,970
Ungrateful.

604
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:16,659
The characters on the two dragon bones are different.

605
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:17,520
Yes.

606
00:34:19,449 --> 00:34:20,380
What is it?

607
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,310
No one can tell.

608
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,780
It's not a secret if you can tell.

609
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:25,920
Yunqi.

610
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,900
When the dragon bone is back,

611
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,620
you can inquire it yourself.

612
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:33,330
I'm not interested in the secret of Penta-sect.

613
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,000
It's something my father told me to keep,

614
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,179
so I must get it back.

615
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:39,909
Yunqi.

616
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:41,420
I've thought about it.

617
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:42,639
Your priority now

618
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:44,710
is to be the next Heaven Official.

619
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,000
Why do you care about this?

620
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:50,530
I'm from Penta-sect.

621
00:34:50,699 --> 00:34:52,230
Of course I consider for it.

622
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,790
I won't be Heaven Official.

623
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,620
Why?

624
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,820
Your father gave you the Dragon Sceptre and dragon bones.

625
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,020
That's what he meant.

626
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:14,430
Yunqi.

627
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,440
Promise me.

628
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:19,720
When you grow up,

629
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,240
don't join Penta-sect

630
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:24,820
or become Heaven Official.

631
00:35:24,970 --> 00:35:25,810
OK.

632
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:27,990
Repeat it.

633
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,610
I won't join Penta-sect or become Heaven Official.

634
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,930
I know my mother is dead and won't come back.

635
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,260
I can vaguely figure out

636
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:38,450
why she died.

637
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,940
A man from the Heaven Official's family can't be accompanied by his mother.

638
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,400
This is God's punishment.

639
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,790
Your grandfather, great grandfather,

640
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:46,470
and the other 26 heaven officials of our family

641
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:48,000
have all been through this.

642
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:49,290
If you can't even protect

643
00:35:49,290 --> 00:35:50,620
your own wife and child,

644
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,890
then what's the meaning of being Heaven Official?

645
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:53,110
Are you still a man?

646
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,530
It's your fate to be Heaven Official.

647
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,420
Accept it.

648
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:03,230
My fate is up to me.

649
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:06,210
I'd rather die than join Penta-sect.

650
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,830
Listen to me for your own good.

651
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:16,670
Use the Dragon Sceptre

652
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:18,060
to order Zhou Qiuhai to return the dragon bone.

653
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,590
He wouldn't dare to refuse.

654
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,290
As long as you use the Dragon Sceptre,

655
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:22,050
it means

656
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,640
you've become the next Heaven Official.

657
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:26,790
I told you

658
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:27,650
I won't do it.

659
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,530
Why?

660
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,370
Forget it. I can't talk sense into you.

661
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,090
I won't do it anyway.

662
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,110
Yunqi, you're letting your father down.

663
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:43,630
I made it clear six years ago.

664
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,920
He understood what I meant.

665
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:48,720
You are your father's only son.

666
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:49,470
This...

667
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,220
What's wrong with being Heaven Official?

668
00:36:54,470 --> 00:36:55,520
What's wrong?

669
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,000
Penta-sect

670
00:36:58,750 --> 00:37:00,150
is the whole world to you.

671
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:01,270
But in my eyes,

672
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,100
it's just a swamp that consumes people.

673
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,390
Master Ding.

674
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,210
Your son is crazy.

675
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:17,530
I came all the way to Shanghai

676
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,790
thinking that you would become the next Heaven Official.

677
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,590
And we can have a backbone again.

678
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,060
I didn't expect this.

679
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,640
In that case,

680
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,420
why did you put up a notice looking for your father?

681
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,620
Why did you come back?

682
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:38,120
I'll go ask Zhou Qiuhai for the dragon bone back.

683
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:39,830
Dragon Sceptre and dragon bone.

684
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:41,050
I'll return them to your father.

685
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:41,800
Put it down.

686
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,720
Are you going to be Heaven Official or not?

687
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,200
No.

688
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:52,090
Then these things don't belong to you.

689
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,180
I'll give them back to Master Ding.

690
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,950
If you go to Zhou Qiuhai now,

691
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,430
it equals giving these to him in vain.

692
00:37:58,770 --> 00:37:59,970
What should I do then?

693
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,560
If you trust me,

694
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,050
leave these to me.

695
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,900
Whether I take the post or not,

696
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,980
I'm still Ding Yuanshan's son.

697
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,170
These are two separate things.

698
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:14,560
In my opinion,

699
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,210
they are the same.

700
00:38:24,430 --> 00:38:26,240
I oppose and hate Penta-sect,

701
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:28,630
but not my father.

702
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,910
He is my only family

703
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,840
in this world.

704
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,970
In his letter,

705
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,000
Master Ding asked me to listen to you.

706
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,250
Rest here.

707
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,080
I'll go get the dragon bone back.

708
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,340
We can discuss the rest

709
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,440
after I come back.

710
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:54,560
Of course,

711
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,600
since I'm not Heaven Official,

712
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,260
you don't have to listen to me.

713
00:38:59,120 --> 00:38:59,880
General,

714
00:39:03,700 --> 00:39:05,160
you really won't let us go?

715
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:05,970
Wrong.

716
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:09,410
If I really don't want to let the Penta-sect go,

717
00:39:09,410 --> 00:39:10,670
I would have done something

718
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,100
at the dock that night.

719
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:18,990
What I want is Ding Yuanshan.

720
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:21,460
If Ding Yuanshan won't show up,

721
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:24,400
Ding Yunqi must be mine.

722
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:26,630
I only have to do my job.

723
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,650
As for other affairs in Penta-sect,

724
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:30,700
I'll leave it to you, Sect Leader Zhou,

725
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,960
to handle it yourself.

726
00:39:32,430 --> 00:39:33,690
As long as you don't do something aggressively,

727
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:35,200
I won't give you a hard time.

728
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,730
Let's go our separate ways.

729
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:37,970
What do

730
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,070
you think?

731
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,600
It sounds

732
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,450
quite good.

733
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,890
But Yunqi is not here with us.

734
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,490
He's not here,

735
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,090
but Wu Shuang is.

736
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,700
I want

737
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:00,230
Wu Shuang to do me a favor.

738
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,510
What can she do?

739
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:06,270
As long as she's here, Ding Yunqi will appear.

740
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,670
You want to use her as a bait

741
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,060
to lure Ding Yunqi?

742
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:18,880
Lure?

743
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,360
Why didn't I think of this?

744
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:24,940
How about this, Sect Leader Zhou?

745
00:40:25,130 --> 00:40:27,360
As long as Miss Wu Shuang cooperates and goes with us,

746
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,080
I'll definitely send her back tomorrow

747
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,850
no matter Ding Yunqi shows up or not.

748
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:31,640
How's that?

749
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,090
What do you want to do to Ding Yunqi?

750
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,990
You don't have to worry about that.

751
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:40,560
You do business of a private bank.

752
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,520
You are better at accounting than me.

753
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,520
What do you think?

754
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,870
One person

755
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,390
for Penta-sect.

756
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,010
You won't be losing, right?

757
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,380
General,

758
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:54,030
your plan

759
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,380
is really good.

760
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,590
Although Ding Yunqi is not a member of Penta-sect,

761
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,430
after all,

762
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:05,960
he's the descendant of the Ding's Heaven Official.

763
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,290
Using Wu Shuang as a bait

764
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:08,990
to capture one of the Ding's.

765
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:10,830
This deal

766
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,700
is a no from me.

767
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:21,830
Mr. Zhou.

768
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,180
A true hero.

769
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:24,710
Righteous and loyal.

770
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,030
I admire you.

771
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:27,290
Unfortunately,

772
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,180
since ancient times,

773
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,860
heroes don't live long.

774
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:37,080
I can't say I'm a hero.

775
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:39,420
But for the reputation of Penta-sect,

776
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:41,950
it is better to die when life is a disgrace.
