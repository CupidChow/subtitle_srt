[Episode 13]

4
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,630
If possible,

5
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,280
I want to swap Wu Shuang back.

6
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,120
With what?

7
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,850
He can't open that Han tomb.

8
00:01:48,229 --> 00:01:49,910
Or the lives of Luo Yunsong's whole family.

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,280
Yunqi, he has thousands of people now,

10
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,460
and guns and cannons.

11
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,350
How can you fight with them?

12
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:58,729
Xuewen.

13
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,470
You are always right, Uncle.

14
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,740
But there is one thing wrong.

15
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,430
What Commander Hu really wants

16
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,540
is the Kunlun Mountains that no one has ever seen.

17
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:19,020
If we really want to swap,

18
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,590
you can only use the Kunlun Mountains to swap Wu Shuang.

19
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,100
So,

20
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:25,700
do you still think

21
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,710
what he cares least is Wu Shuang?

22
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,420
Is the information

23
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,250
correct?

24
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,890
Yes.

25
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,430
I didn't expect this fatty

26
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,560
to be so greedy.

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,950
I really underestimated him.

28
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,650
You underestimated human's greed.

29
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,950
Hundreds of sappers are openly digging.

30
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,970
Since they've dug up the layer of dust,

31
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,520
then it will only be one or two days

32
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,990
before they open the tomb gate.

33
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,930
Commander Hu will definitely make a move after the tomb is opened.

34
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:07,360
By then,

35
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:09,580
it'll be hard for Wu Shuang to get away.

36
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,200
If we can't save her before then,

37
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,210
it would be even harder after that.

38
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,060
I invited you here today

39
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:18,780
to cooperate with you

40
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,260
under this emergent situation

41
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,030
and let go of our grudges for now and save her together.

42
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,070
Okay.

43
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,560
I'll contact you

44
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,940
if I get any information.

45
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,920
You inform me

46
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,730
if you have any plans.

47
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:43,180
Do you know Her Ladyship's address?

48
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:45,660
Yes.

49
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:49,900
Her Ladyship has gone to Nanjing.

50
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,040
We don't know when

51
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:51,920
she will be back yet.

52
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,620
Please give me

53
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,130
her address then, Uncle.

54
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,320
Okay.

55
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,160
Thank you.

56
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,480
You don't have to thank me now.

57
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,510
Order a bowl of Plain Noodles.

58
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,740
I'll order a bowl of noodles.

59
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:12,620
OK.

60
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:50,420
[Turn Over A New Leaf]

61
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,690
What are you thinking?

62
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:02,060
I wonder

63
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:04,740
what Yunqi is doing now.

64
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,290
Do you regret not listening to Yunqi

65
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,890
and going up the mountain with me?

66
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,580
I don't regret it.

67
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,590
Your shitty brother said

68
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,320
as long as I open the Small Kunlun,

69
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,530
he would give the dragon bone back.

70
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,140
Is the dragon bone that important?

71
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,400
Yes.

72
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,580
I will

73
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,720
return the dragon bone to Yunqi with my own hands.

74
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,290
Wu Shuang.

75
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,770
Do you want the dragon bone

76
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,250
or the engagement?

77
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:38,760
Is...

78
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:41,530
Isn't this the same thing?

79
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,010
If I help him get the dragon bone,

80
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,520
maybe

81
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,460
he would admit the engagement.

82
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:50,690
That's why I came to help you regardless of the discouragement.

83
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,340
This dragon bone

84
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,890
has almost become my sore.

85
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,580
Not only didn't it work this time,

86
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,840
but also did I get locked up.

87
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,430
I'm so mad!

88
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,620
Wu Shuang.

89
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:03,710
Don't worry.

90
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,020
Even if Commander Hu has the dragon bone,

91
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,290
I will try my best to get it back for you.

92
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:09,970
Really?

93
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:12,400
I promise.

94
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,380
Fine.

95
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,270
I'd like to see

96
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,670
what Ding Yunqi will say by then.

97
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,570
Do you

98
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,550
have to get married?

99
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:26,980
Of course.

100
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,030
How can a girl

101
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,800
not get married after the engagement?

102
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:32,390
If it were you, wouldn't you marry him?

103
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,830
I...

104
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,680
Not necessarily.

105
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:39,070
I don't care.

106
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,750
I have to marry him.

107
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:42,680
I just have to do it in this matter.

108
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,870
Master personally betrothed me to him.

109
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,670
He just didn't admit it.

110
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,180
No way.

111
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,000
If he doesn't admit it, you can have someone else.

112
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:56,250
Our field of mound-digging is different from the outside world.

113
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,640
Women can't marry anyone

114
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,150
other than Kunlun Heaven Officials.

115
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,410
I have no choice.

116
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,480
Either I am alone forever,

117
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,450
or I marry Ding Yunqi.

118
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,020
Really?

119
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:13,550
I think Ding Yunqi likes Wu Shuang.

120
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:17,630
What is it like to like someone?

121
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,570
It's...

122
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,840
always putting you in an important position.

123
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,580
I think so.

124
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:29,260
He would rather give up the dragon bone

125
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,690
to protect you.

126
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:32,540
Really?

127
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,970
If he likes me,

128
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,610
will he marry me

129
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,080
after he gets the dragon bone?

130
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,770
I think so.

131
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:43,240
That's great.

132
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,520
If I had known this,

133
00:07:46,730 --> 00:07:48,620
I wouldn't have reasoned so much with him.

134
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,890
Well,

135
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,190
do you like him?

136
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:53,530
Yes.

137
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:56,050
You won't regret marrying him like this?

138
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,570
No.

139
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,670
Yunqi is a good man,

140
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:00,800
and he's good at martial arts.

141
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,560
I'm quite satisfied.

142
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,700
You don't know.

143
00:08:03,990 --> 00:08:05,420
I envied him so much

144
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,930
when I went to his home as a kid.

145
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,790
I thought one day

146
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:12,270
I would also like to have my own home.

147
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,800
In fact, Master is very good to me.

148
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,620
I'm grateful for his upbringing too.

149
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:21,250
But...

150
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,140
with Yunqi,

151
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,330
I don't have to stay in mound-digging field forever.

152
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,020
I would be able to live a normal life.

153
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:36,830
Wu Shuang.

154
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:38,220
Trust me.

155
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,070
You will have your own home.

176
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,290
You must have lost my comb.

178
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,640
What comb? I didn't...

179
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,280
That's my amulet.

OK. I'll compensate you.

It's the last meal anyway.

203
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:17,240
Do you know why you are here?

204
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,550
I thought I knew.

205
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,650
But during the quiet moments of these two days,

206
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,040
I realized many things.

207
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,350
I think I finally know.

208
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:30,050
What?

209
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,230
It doesn't matter

210
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:37,190
who trapped or harmed whom.

211
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,160
What matters is

212
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,770
my foundation is unstable.

213
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,850
What else?

214
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,090
I could have

215
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,730
fought in the wild place,

216
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,840
and returned with the wind.

217
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:57,810
However...

218
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,160
You're going to die today. Do you know?

219
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,000
What kind of stuffing is this dumpling?

220
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,170
I haven't figured it out for a long time.

221
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,600
Well, a dying man...

222
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,540
Tofu stuffing.

223
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,600
You're dying,

224
00:13:34,850 --> 00:13:37,160
and you can still figure out the taste of filling.

225
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,200
Do you have anything else to say?

226
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:43,590
Is it still useful?

227
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,630
Maybe.

228
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,630
So Commander, I...

229
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:00,560
There... there is still a chance

230
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,690
you can forgive me?

231
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,950
Maybe.

232
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:19,330
Commander, look.

233
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,090
I'm crippled, but my brain still works.

234
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:22,440
I always wonder

235
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,080
why I haven't been successful these years.

236
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,090
Because my foundation is not strong enough.

237
00:14:26,090 --> 00:14:27,270
If you, the Commander

238
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,030
don't mind,

239
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:32,350
I'm willing to follow your lead.

240
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,480
You are intending to have an official as a relative.

241
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,930
What a strong foundation.

242
00:14:49,950 --> 00:14:52,300
How much do you know

243
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,060
about that bone in your brother's hands?

244
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,870
I... I know it so well.

245
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,630
The dragon bone was originally... The dragon bone...

246
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,190
Where is that bone now?

247
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,740
It's...

248
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,750
My brother has it.

249
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,730
We went there

250
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,790
and searched thoroughly,

251
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:08,180
but didn't find it.

252
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:10,860
You cannot find it.

253
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,320
Right?

254
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,210
I searched at home too.

255
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:13,170
Of course I couldn't find it either.

256
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,260
It must not be at home.

257
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,940
It's so precious. My brother must...

258
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,880
If you can find this bone,

259
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,280
we can still talk.

260
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,110
How about

261
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,450
I...

262
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:28,630
go

263
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,220
ask my brother?

264
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:36,690
Wait for my news.

265
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:45,680
If you can't find it,

266
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,330
we'll never meet again.

267
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,610
I understand.

268
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:54,880
Is there any vegetable on my teeth?

269
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,230
Commander.

270
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,790
Do you think Luo Yunsong will

271
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,050
give the dragon bone to Luo Jiutian?

272
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:18,480
The two brothers of the Luo family

273
00:16:18,690 --> 00:16:20,750
are both troublesome.

274
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,690
Let's wait and see.

275
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,170
If he cannot give me the dragon bone,

276
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:31,290
I will kill Luo Jiutian.

277
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:04,849
Jiutian.

278
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,030
I...

279
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,710
am the Conqueror,

280
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,320
Xiang Yu.

281
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:51,420
I cut the ground with Liu Bang at Honggou,

282
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:54,030
made an agreement and retreated my troops.

283
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,600
I also sent back his father and wife.

284
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,520
What's wrong with him?

285
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:02,380
I didn't expect him to betray the vow

286
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,900
and came to fight again.

287
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:08,600
I ordered to get the information of the frontline

288
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:14,440
but there was no report.

289
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,970
I killed many top warriors

290
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,470
in the Han camp with my spear.

291
00:18:40,270 --> 00:18:41,900
Although I was brave,

292
00:18:42,370 --> 00:18:44,930
how could I fight against

293
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:50,390
the ambush from all sides?

294
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,140
I sent my order not to send the troops out

295
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:02,190
and return to the camps.

296
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:06,410
I'm sorry

297
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:14,480
you have to suffer this time.

298
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:22,730
I killed many top warriors

299
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,830
in the Han camp with my spear.

300
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,260
But I was outnumbered.

301
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,750
And I could not win.

302
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,010
This is...

303
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:45,910
The God wants Chu to die.

304
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,570
It's not the sin

305
00:19:51,710 --> 00:19:55,610
of war.

306
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,290
My dear,

307
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:07,500
the enemy is attacking from everywhere.

308
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,020
Come with me and get out of the encirclement.

309
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,250
You don't behave yourself even in prison.

310
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:24,170
I have great strength

311
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,540
and can pull mountains down.

312
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,620
But my good fortune waned.

313
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:36,350
Even my horse couldn't run any more.

314
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:42,440
I could do nothing since my horse could not run.

315
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:50,340
Yu, my dear,

316
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:59,110
what can I do?

317
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,180
It's your turn.

318
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,530
It's the scene where you kill yourself in front of the troops.

319
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:10,620
And then...

320
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:13,430
Unless I miss you.

321
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:16,540
What's wrong with you?

322
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:23,560
Yuji,

323
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
I'm calling you. Do you respond to me or not?

324
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,900
No.

325
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,100
It's okay if you say no.

326
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,490
Then I have no worries left.

327
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,850
When we're in hell,

328
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:43,250
we can continue our love.

329
00:21:49,390 --> 00:21:51,780
Are you crazy, Luo Jiutian?

330
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,630
No.

331
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:56,900
To be frank, I just came to see you.

332
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,250
I will feel relieved

333
00:21:58,710 --> 00:21:59,550
after seeing you.

334
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:00,980
Then I...

335
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,170
I'm leaving.

336
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,910
You won't see me after I leave.

337
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,250
And...

338
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,540
Don't look for me.

339
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,050
If you want to find me one day,

340
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:22,900
find me later.

341
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,690
What are you talking about?

342
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,010
Brother, what's wrong with you?

343
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,370
He'll be shot to death soon.

344
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,170
Let me ask you one last thing.

345
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,470
I mean if.

If you

and I are both not married,

353
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,550
will you marry me then?

354
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:38,120
If you don't answer it,

355
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,250
I'll take that as a yes.

Let me out! I want to make a call!

When I'm leaving,

I realized that in this world,

No.

As long as I'm alive,

437

he'll be dead.

438
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,850
I don't understand

439
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,070
why he would kill Jiutian first.

440
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:00,980

he has run out of patience.

00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:05,560
He has been holding it for so long.

443
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,450
He has been thinking about

444
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,840
the dragon bone.

445
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:12,950
Dragon bone?

446
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:13,870
Yes.

447
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,740
He's also after the Kunlun Mountains.

448
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,680
He could just tell you directly.

449
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,530
Why did he kill Jiutian?

450
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,510
We'll all die if we give him the dragon bone.

451
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:26,850
If we don't,

452
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:30,880
there's still some room to turn around.

453
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,160

00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,270
Did you meet the lieutenant?

457
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,620
I've said everything I could.

00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:33,460
does Kunlun Mountains really exist in this world?

461
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,150
Well...

462
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,440
you Kunlun Heaven Officials know this better than anyone.

463
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,230
I just want to know.

464
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:48,290
If it does exist,

465
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,670
why did the ancestors of the Penta-sect

466
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,310
leave these treasures behind?

467
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:52,150
Didn't they know

468
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,580
people would fight to death

469
00:34:53,830 --> 00:34:55,380
for the Kunlun Mountains?

470
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,610
Of course they knew.

471
00:34:58,530 --> 00:34:59,710
That's why

472
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,310
there is Heaven Official.

473
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,280
His duty

474
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:04,880
is to keep the secret.

475
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,150
Your father's biggest mistake

476
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,050
was to leak the secret.

477
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,170
Without these treasures,

478
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:17,470
we won't need to keep it a secret.

479
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:18,690
Uncle,

480
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,500
you misunderstood my father greatly.

481
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:21,380
Fine.

482
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,890
Let's not talk about your father today,

483
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,290
nor the Kunlun Mountains.

484
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,510
My father had the accident first

485
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,810
and then my friends

486
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,870
who could be executed at any time.

487
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:32,800
The root of all this

488
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:34,190
is the Kunlun Mountains.

489

You're the next Heaven Official,

490
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:42,170
and the guardian of the Kunlun Mountains.

491
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:45,280
If you handle it well,

492
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,600
no more people would die again.

493

I'm not a god.

494
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,540
I cannot control people's desires.

495
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,270
The only thing that I'm doing now is to

496
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:02,580
save

497
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,310

All the disciples of Mound-digging

502

have been ambushed here.

503
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:13,890
It's best if you can negotiate it well there.

504
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,990
If not,

505
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,420
we'll just fight.

506
00:37:20,110 --> 00:37:21,030
The Penta-sect

507
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:22,550
is never afraid of anyone.

508
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,280
After you send the signal,

509
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,300
we will fight to go inside.

510

The blood of the Penta-sect

511

will always mix with enemies.

512
00:37:46,910 --> 00:37:48,460
But we never have the habit of

513
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,800
being slaughtered by others.

514
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,770
Thank you, Uncle.

515
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,360
But I don't like killing.

516
00:37:58,030 --> 00:37:59,080
I don't want to see

517
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,760
anyone's blood.
