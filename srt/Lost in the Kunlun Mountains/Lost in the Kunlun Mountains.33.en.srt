[Episode 33]

4
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,050
Yunqi.

5
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:44,789
It's almost done.

6
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:47,060
Biao and I will guard the first half of night.

7
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:48,700
You and Sanxuan will guard the night after.

8
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,039
Okay.

9
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:19,770
Fengling.

10
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:22,040
Brother said that you will live in that tent.

11
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:25,950
Biao.

12
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,090
Do you think this is the Kunlun Mountains?

13
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,690
I don't know.

14
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:30,740
I don't care about these.

15
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,540
Then what do you care about?

16
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,910
I only care

17
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,720
that everyone is safe.

18
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:07,820
Fengling.

19
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:08,960
I'll put the water here.

20
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,550
Brother.

21
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:26,180
You're still up?

22
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,890
Yes.

23
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:29,030
Have a seat.

24
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,040
Thank you.

25
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:40,240
I'm willing to do it.

26
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,660
It's painful

27
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,380
to love someone but cannot be with her.

28
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,760
Now,

29
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,690
I'm very satisfied.

30
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,620
Being able to stay by her side

31
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,470
and protect her

32
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:06,870
is already like my dream coming true.

33
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,230
Biao,

34
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:11,910
I have to thank you.

35
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,840
Fengling

36
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:14,940
is my sister.

37
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:17,040
I can only entrust you

38
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,300
to protect her.

39
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,310
Because I trust you the most.

40
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,290
I believe

41
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,920
if one day in the future,

42
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,270
something bad happens to me,

43
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,950
you will definitely protect her well.

44
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,050
Brother.

45
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,600
There's no if.

46
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,550
Who's there?

47
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,590
What's wrong, brother?

48
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,100
There's noise in the forest.

49
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,740
Biao,

50
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:54,840
Wu Shuang, you stay here.

51
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:55,760
San,

52
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,810
Yunqi, let's go.

53
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,530
Go in.

54
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,660
Go in.

55
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,670
Can it be a beast?

56
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:17,720
No.

57
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:18,980
It must be a person.

58
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,170
After him!

59
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,880
You mortals

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,470
are not allowed to come near here.

61
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,400
If you don't leave now,

62
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,080
you may die.

63
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:31,010
Fengling, go back to the tent.

64
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:34,120
Didn't you want to abandon me long ago?

65
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,590
If I disappear,

66
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:36,810
or am abducted by someone,

67
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,030
wouldn't you be happier?

68
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,460
Chu Fengling.

69
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,620
Don't be such a kid. I won't tolerate it.

70
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:46,430
San Jin.

71
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,150
You go back to the tent, too.

72
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,670
Don't come out if there's nothing else.

73
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,310
If the enemy can't see your exact location,

74
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,310
it'll be safer.

75
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:54,360
Okay.

76
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,060
What do you think?

77
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:25,910
He's a young man.

78
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,830
He ran too fast.

79
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,630
We lost him.

80
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,600
What about his background?

81
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:31,410
We didn't see him clearly.

82
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:32,920
But his clothing was weird.

83
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:35,690
This place is so remote.

84
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:37,120
Could it be a native?

85
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,680
I don't think so. From the clothing,

86
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,900
he looks like a person from the Song Dynasty.

87
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,540
Song Dynasty?

88
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,260
Northern Song or Southern Song?

89
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,070
It's been over 1,000 years since the Northern Song Dynasty.

90
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,630
The Southern Song Dynasty would be hundreds of years ago.

91
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:49,970
Is it a zombie?

92
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:50,980
Could he

93
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,740
take the medicine of immortality from the First Emperor of Qin?

94
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,750
One person

95
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,050
will die.

96
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:03,830
But a group of people

97
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:05,130
won't.

98
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,930
Wu Shuang means

99
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,320
after I die, my son is still alive.

100
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,510
My son will give birth to grandsons and grandsons will have children.

101
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,610
Children after children, grandsons after grandsons.

102
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,450
There will always be descendants.

103
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,510
Yunqi, what are you talking about?

104
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,390
Say something I can understand.

105
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,640
We haven't found

106
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,810
their traces of life

107
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,610
because

108
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,330
we haven't entered their living area.

109
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,630
Tomorrow,

110
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,770
we'll see

111
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,620
what's there.

112
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:01,200
We lost him somewhere here yesterday.

113
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,370
Brother.

114
00:09:06,790 --> 00:09:07,710
Look at this.

115
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:08,970
Is this the smoke bomb

116
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:10,150
you encountered last night?

117
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,650
This smoke bomb

118
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,130
looks like something from Gold Touching.

119
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,130
It's a bit different.

120
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,640
But it should be something of Gold Touching.

121
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,090
Can he be a member of the Penta-sect?

122
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,850
The Book of Ban brought us here.

123
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,660
This place must be related to the Penta-sect.

124
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,090
Let's go inside and check.

125
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,400
Okay.

126
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,400
-Let's go. -Let's go.

127
00:09:57,690 --> 00:09:58,950
There are artificial traces here.

128
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,130
It should be here.

129
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,810
Let's go.

130
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:46,870
This is the place.

131
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,130
Be careful.

132
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:50,480
Yunqi.

133
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,580
What is this place?

134
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,350
This is the place the book says.

135
00:10:58,510 --> 00:10:59,300
Let's go.

136
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,140
Be careful.

137
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,700
Someone lives here?

138
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,250
And it's a village.

139
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,980
Who would live here?

140
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,390
Some wood is new and some old.

141
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:47,160
It means that

142
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,250
someone has been maintaining it.

143
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,490
No.

144
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,260
It's too quiet.

145
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,670
Oh no.

146
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,050
We are trapped in the tactics.

147
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:24,870
Let's go.

148
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,210
Willow catkins.

149
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:08,220
Stop.

150
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,130
Who are you?

151
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,560
My father, Ding Yuanshan,

152
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,990
was the former Heaven Official.

153
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,210
Do you have proof?

154
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,360
According to the Book of Ban,

155
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,920
only the Heaven Official's Soul Pursuit Order

156
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,190
can open the gate of the Heaven Official's headquarters.

157
00:14:58,870 --> 00:14:59,870
Why not give it a try?

158
00:15:10,630 --> 00:15:11,890
I don't know it was the Heaven Official.

159
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,230
I'm sorry if I offended you.

160
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,990
I'm

161
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,040
Yu Shiqi.

162
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,570
I am Yu Shijiu.

163
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,800
Greetings to the descendant of the Heaven Official.

164
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:24,530
My father once said

165
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,840
the Ding Family has a branch

166
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,690
guarding the gate of the headquarters for generations.

167
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:30,030
In order to hide the truth,

168
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:32,800
they changed the surname to Yu,

169
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:33,850
which

170
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,410
represents lifetime.

171
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,960
You...

172
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,070
Human's foundation in heaven and earth

173
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,290
is trust.

174
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,710
Those who believe it

175
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:44,180
will not make promises easily

176
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:45,990
and will definitely keep their promises.

177
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:47,590
For generations,

178
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,520
all the descendants

179
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,200
will keep it.

180
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:57,750
This is our Ding Family's ancestral rule.

181
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,510
We

182
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:02,120
are all descendants of the Ding Family.

183
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,010
The offspring of the Heaven Official is here.

184
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,070
We can finally return to our real family.

185
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,980
The Yu Family abides by the ancestral rules

186
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:13,120
to protect the Bronze House in the headquarters

187
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,250
and never slacks off.

188
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,650
I hope you can check it.

189
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,780
Indeed.

190
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:19,970
We've experienced your skills

191
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,770
of protecting the headquarters.

192
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:24,210
Shiqi.

193
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,930
When did you move in?

194
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,870
We don't know when.

195
00:16:29,370 --> 00:16:31,810
But I know I am the 31st generation.

196
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,580
The 31st generation.

197
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,470
Even if one generation lasts for only 20 years,

198
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,110
it's been over 600 years.

199
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,420
Fortunately, there is the Book of Ban.

200
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,850
Otherwise, the Heaven Official's headquarters

201
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,400
will never be discovered.

202
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,890
Can we go in and have a look?

203
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,550
In the headquarters,

204
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,900
memorial tablets of the former Heaven Officials are kept

205
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:55,750
and it's the sacred place in the cave.

206
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,190
Our people will not enter without permission.

207
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,240
Only the succeeding Heaven Official,

208
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,220
with the memorial tablet of the former

209
00:17:02,390 --> 00:17:03,480
can enter.

210
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,010
My father was the last Heaven Official.

211
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:09,319
Can I

212
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,000
put my father's memorial tablet

213
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,130
in there?

214
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:16,160
Then only you can enter.

215
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:18,430
OK.

216
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:21,540
Brother.

217
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,630
Wait for me here.

218
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,050
Guys.

219
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:39,850
This way, please.

220
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,050
Ding.

221
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,850
Be careful.

222
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:40,550
My ancestors said

223
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:42,980
every Heaven Official who enters the headquarters

224
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:45,290
should know the two traps in the headquarters.

225
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:47,850
Although you are not the Heaven Official,

226
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:49,870
you are the only descendant of the Ding Family

227
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,470
and it is fate that lets you enter the headquarters.

228
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,580
So I need to

229
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,190
tell you the two traps.

230
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,130
Go ahead.

231
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,490
The gate of the headquarters

232
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,260
can be opened by the Heaven Official's Soul Pursuit Order

233
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,780
or the star map.

234
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:13,140
If outsiders play with the star map,

235
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:15,240
the gate will open as usual.

236
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,790
But after it closes,

237
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,740
the lock on the door will break itself

238
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:22,080
and completely lock the gate.

239
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:27,370
This is also a defense mechanism

240
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,140
to prevent outsiders from entering the headquarters.

241
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,460
Ding, do you know the key to the star map?

242
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,500
What do you say about the key to the star map?

243
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:41,610
I only know that the key to the star map

244
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:44,260
doesn't exist in any books of the Penta-sect,

245
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,110
not even in the Book of Ban.

246
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,420
It is only passed down

247
00:22:49,590 --> 00:22:51,190
from Heaven Officials to their successors.

248
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,930
My father once said

249
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,490
there was a Heaven Official who died in an accident.

250
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,970
Many things were not recorded.

251
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:02,150
No one knows those Heaven Official's secrets

252
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,750
that were passed down by mouth now.

253
00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:07,230
I'm afraid it will depend on fate

254
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:08,320
to know

255
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:11,260
the key to the star map.

256
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,380
In this Bronze House,

257
00:23:16,350 --> 00:23:17,690
there is only one exit.

258
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,590
The Bronze House

259
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,890
was built in one.

260
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,740
There is no second exit.

261
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:24,870
After it is locked,

262
00:23:25,330 --> 00:23:26,800
it can only be opened with the key.

263
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,850
This is another trap.

264
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,970
If you turn the tablet in the middle,

265
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,900
it will be on.

266
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,970
Once it is on,

267
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,190
the whole cave will collapse

268
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,330
and become nothing.

269
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:18,880
[Heaven Official Ding Yuanshan]

270
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:27,200
[Ancestor of Heaven Official]

271
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:48,830
Look, there's a car.

272
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,690
This place is at the border of natural barriers.

273
00:25:03,190 --> 00:25:06,050
The abnormal scene of blood moon occurs every three years.

274
00:25:06,850 --> 00:25:08,190
When the blood moon appears,

275
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,330
the tides out of Dulong Cave will drop

276
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,640
and the cave will appear.

277
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,510
We must be more careful

278
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:17,930
to prevent the intrusion during such times.

279
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:22,720
The blood moon appeared last night.

280
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,960
So, we came at the right time.

281
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,380
Yes.

282
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,400
Shiqi.

283
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:31,160
How do you live here?

284
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,260
This cave expands in the whole mountain.

285
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:34,650
There are a few caves

286
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,160
where light can come down from the top.

287
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,550
My ancestors carried soil inside

288
00:25:39,230 --> 00:25:41,580
so we have fields to farm.

289
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,550
There are not many people in the cave.

290
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,060
So we can feed ourselves.

291
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,450
I see.

292
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,630
No wonder

293
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:49,260
there are no traces of your lives outside.

294
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:53,130
But haven't you considered moving out?

295
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:56,320
The Yu Family has guarded the headquarters for generations.

296
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,790
Apart from mountain patrollers,

297
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,140
nobody will get out unless dead.

298
00:26:03,590 --> 00:26:04,430
Shiqi.

299
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,270
I'm afraid

300
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:08,460
there's no peace here after we came.

301
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:11,690
I have an inappropriate request.

302
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,170
Ding, please go ahead.

303
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,060
Let's talk on the way.

304
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,920
There's fuel in the car and they hid it and didn't drive it.

305
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,110
This means

306
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,640
a car

307
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,030
cannot get to the following place.

308
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,380
Master,

309
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,930
we've been looking for them for so long but we haven't found them.

310
00:26:46,930 --> 00:26:48,190
Could someone help them

311
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,370
and they have left?

312
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:52,560
Since the Black Feather Team and the Gold Touching disciples

313
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,830
are still camping nearby,

314
00:26:56,550 --> 00:26:59,190
That means they haven't gone far.

315
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:00,960
Not driving a car.

316
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,640
That means

317
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:05,830
they took the water route.

318
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,020
Go to the fishing village ahead

319
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:12,090
to check if anyone rented a boat across the river.

320
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,220
Yes.

321
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:22,040
Ding Yunqi,

322
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,660
you ran so fast.

323
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:46,530
San Jin.

324
00:27:46,950 --> 00:27:47,790
Be careful.

325
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,790
Don't worry, brother.

326
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:50,140
No.

327
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,650
Is this all the firewood you've got?

328
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,370
It's not even enough for one night.

329
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,100
Fengling is alone in the camp.

330
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,920
I'm worried.

331
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,600
Don't worry.

332
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:02,570
It's so remote here and there are no people.

333
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:04,290
She can't report to Her Ladyship.

334
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,930
Biao,

335
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,360
take this time

336
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,870
and get more firewood.

337
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,180
Maybe I can catch a big fish.

338
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:22,950
Biao.

339
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,800
OMG.

340
00:28:34,410 --> 00:28:35,750
A family,

341
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,350
in order to keep a promise,

342
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,070
can live in a dim place

343
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:40,660
for generations.

344
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,440
For a promise,

345
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,620
it's been hundreds of years.

346
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:47,130
It's really admirable.

347
00:28:50,910 --> 00:28:51,790
Yunqi.

348
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,330
What's wrong?

349
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,720
You've been absent-minded since you came out of the cave.

350
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,360
What did Shiqi tell you?

351
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,490
You two were mumbling.

352
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:02,960
I asked him

353
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,270
if my wife was pretty.

354
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:12,410
Shiqi and I discussed

355
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:13,670
how to lure Tian Long out.

356
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,200
Lure him with the Heaven Official's headquarters?

357
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:19,430
With me.

358
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,440
Don't you think

359
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,700
I'm a perfect bait?

361
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,370
Something happened to Fengling.

362
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,300
Let's go.

363
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:53,360
What are you doing?

364
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,040
Did you want to light the woods

365
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,260
or yourself?

366
00:29:56,890 --> 00:29:58,240
I just wanted to make a fire.

367
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,000
I don't even have the right to make a fire?

368
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,600
Do you know how to make a fire?

369
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,230
Do you think I'll believe you?

370
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:04,540
He Biao.

371
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,550
Are you going to do this to me, too?

372
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,360
I don't want to get mad at you.

373
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:09,910
But you know clearly

374
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:11,050
what you're doing now.

375
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:12,560
There is a big potential that

376
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,730
our position is exposed.

377
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,710
You'll be in danger if I'm not around.

378
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,250
Believe it or not.

379
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,890
I just wanted to make a fire.

380
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:25,240
I saw brother and San Jin do it.

381
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,750
I did it because I thought it was not hard.

382
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:32,970
Miss Chu, are you alright?

383
00:30:33,930 --> 00:30:34,650
Miss Chu.

384
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:35,740
You must be scared.

385
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,060
I'm fine. San Jin.

386
00:30:50,610 --> 00:30:51,530
What happened?

387
00:30:57,240 --> 00:30:58,210
It's my fault, Brother.

388
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,740
Well, Brother,

389
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:03,670
Miss Chu wanted to help,

390
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:05,850
but she didn’t know how to make a fire. So this is it.

391
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:06,650
It's okay.

392
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,480
Pack up and get ready to change camps.

393
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,610
I hope Her Ladyship's men can find it quickly.

Why did you call me back in such a hurry?

Aiwu, Yunqi gave me a task.

Where did they go?

459

The fisherman said

460
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,010
because of the dropping tides,

461
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:06,150
a cave under the Tianlong Mountain

462
00:36:06,150 --> 00:36:07,160
was revealed.

463
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,670
They went in through the cave.

we are friends with the guests he sent before

468
00:36:15,430 --> 00:36:16,770
and asked him to send us there, too.

469
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,750
Now he is waiting for us

470
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:19,970
with the boat by the river.

471
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,110

00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,590
Do you know

522
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:04,400
why San Jin and Yang Aiwu went out?

523
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,160
I don't know.

524
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:08,050
You lied to me.

525
00:42:08,350 --> 00:42:09,190
No.

526
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:10,990
Since Brother asked me to protect you,

527
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,970
I kept a distance from them.

528
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,240
I avoided whatever they said.

529
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,660
I really don't know.

530
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,760
They just want to isolate me.

531
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:21,030
No one wants to isolate you.

532
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:23,720
You're too smart.

533
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:25,780
Only by knowing nothing

534
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:28,170
can I keep it from you.

535
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:31,030
Don't ask me.

536
00:42:35,770 --> 00:42:37,290
You're the fox.

537
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,660
That's the direction

538
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,960
of the smoke just now.

539
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,530
Split up. Be careful.

540
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:51,830
Ding Yunqi is sly.

541
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,560
Be careful.

542
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:55,360
Don't be discovered.

543
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:56,450
Yes, sir!

544
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:59,730
Bawang Xiejia.

545
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,790
What a place.
