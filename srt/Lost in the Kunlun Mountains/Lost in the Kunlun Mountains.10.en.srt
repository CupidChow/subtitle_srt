[Episode 10]

4
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,620
I knew it.

5
00:02:16,950 --> 00:02:18,350
You didn't show up today.

6
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,730
It was a bit strange.

7
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,260
Actually,

8
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:30,920
I also came here last night.

9
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,790
But I saw that you were deep asleep,

10
00:02:32,790 --> 00:02:34,450
so I didn't want to wake you up.

11
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,470
You also came yesterday?

12
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,300
Awesome.

13
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,540
Awesome.

14
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:44,820
Did Wu Shuang tell you?

15
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,460
The dragon bone

16
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:50,250
will be returned it to you after we open the Small Kunlun.

17
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,380
She agreed, but I didn't.

18
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:57,540
It's between us.

19
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:02,090
Why do we have to make a girl get involved in it?

20
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,340
You are young and aggressive.

21
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,080
You always rush into doing everything.

22
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,740
Right.

23
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,660
I took your stuff away.

24
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:16,120
I broke my promise by not returning it to you.

25
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,700
What can you do?

26
00:03:27,829 --> 00:03:29,490
No matter how high the wall is,

27
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,150
and no matter how many guards I have here,

28
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,010
you can still go in and out freely.

29
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,610
It's easy to kill me.

30
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,660
But why didn't you kill me?

31
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,810
Because you know it's useless to kill me.

32
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,970
You can't see your father,

33
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,620
and I have the dragon bone.

34
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:47,770
I can lure your father out.

35
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,050
Don't you want to see your father, too?

36
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,079
[Meishan]

37
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,790
It's honorable to ruin a person's reputation.

38
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,860
I always think

39
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,290
you are still a righteous policeman.

40
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,180
Does justice work?

41
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,269
The commander of the National Government

42
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:19,870
robbed a grave arbitrarily.

43
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:22,070
Do you expect a small

44
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,840
director of the police department like me

45
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,900
to uphold justice?

46
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:28,530
Aren't you surprised?

47
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,290
I would be surprised if it were someone else.

48
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,940
But it's Commander Hu,

49
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,240
and whatever he does, I don't think it's strange.

50
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,100
Besides,

51
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,990
you worked so hard

52
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:41,140
to find this.

53
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:42,920
What do you want?

54
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:45,640
Apologize in the newspaper

55
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,700
and clear my father's name. Besides,

56
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,590
give the dragon bone back to me.

57
00:04:50,830 --> 00:04:51,900
What if I don't?

58
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,780
I'll give this letter to the newspaper office.

59
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,580
When it's on the headlines,

60
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,909
it's up to you whether to

61
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,140
arrest Commander Hu.

62
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,440
I can't afford to offend

63
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:03,880
someone like Commander Hu.

64
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,560
Even if he should rob a grave for 100 times,

65
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,290
I would pretend I didn't see it.

66
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,790
So?

67
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,240
So,

68
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,760
you won this round.

69
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,040
Wii you do as I say?

70
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,170
No.

71
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,350
It seems that

72
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:35,150
there's nothing we can discuss.

73
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:37,970
If you think it's good to deal with this,

74
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,270
just do it.

75
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:42,060
At worst, we'll both suffer great loss.

76
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,110
But I'm warning you.

77
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,610
If you really do that,

78
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,450
I will destroy the dragon bone immediately.

79
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,890
You will never get it.

80
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,960
If you really destroy the dragon bone,

81
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,980
it will cause no less trouble than offending Commander Hu.

82
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:03,710
My father and the Penta-sect will not let you off.

83
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,100
I know.

84
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,580
Wu Shuang also told me that

85
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:09,110
in front of Fengling today.

86
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,940
But Ding Yunqi,

87
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,410
I have to gain some benefits.

88
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,310
As I said,

89
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:19,290
after Wu Shuang helps Fengling open the Small Kunlun,

90
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:19,920
I will

91
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:22,590
return the dragon bone to you.

92
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,640
I knew

93
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:29,080
you wouldn't return the dragon bone to me so easily.

94
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,960
I'm here today

95
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,770
to tell you something.

96
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,250
No matter how many people are guarding you,

97
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,970
it's easy for me to kill you.

98
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:40,080
There's a limit to my patience.

99
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,360
Thank you.

100
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:44,280
You're welcome.

101
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,909
No.

102
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:46,630
I thank you

103
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,659
as you didn't tell Fengling about what happened

104
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,190
between your father and me.

105
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,060
I want to wait until the day the misunderstanding is clarified.

106
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,920
Three members of your family have died tragically.

107
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:01,370
I don't want you to be the fourth.

108
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:23,490
It's not a misunderstanding.

109
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:25,480
No.

110
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,540
Stop!

111
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,050
Stop!

112
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:47,280
Stop!

113
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:49,510
Who are you?

114
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,670
The task is finished.

115
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:54,130
There's no need for us to get involved.

116
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,800
Let's go.

117
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,740
Be alert at the door.

118
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:58,750
-Yes. -Yes.

119
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,660
Director,

120
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:18,540
I came across Ding Yunqi just now, and many people came here.

121
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,420
It's okay. Go to sleep at ease.

122
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,900
I'll go check on Lady Fengling.

123
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,820
No need.

124
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,760
Ding Yunqi

125
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,930
is not that kind of person.

126
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,919
Be careful.

127
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:43,820
I'm fine.

128
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,410
Below here

129
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,760
is a big grave.

130
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,400
Are you sure?

131
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,910
Yes.

132
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:34,880
Great.

133
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,250
But I need to figure out

134
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,510
where the entrance is.

135
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,640
For a well designed grave like this,

136
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,160
if you act rashly,

137
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,350
you may not find the entrance even by

138
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:49,050
bombarding the whole mountain and razing it.

139
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:51,470
Wu Shuang, I trust you.

140
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,440
You can do it.

141
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:10,710
Commander Hu.

142
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,890
Yes. I also didn't expect it.

143
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:14,740
It's a bit tricky.

144
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,140
Will the photo of the letter...

145
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,900
No.

146
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,540
It can't be Ding Yunqi.

147
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:23,540
He's not a man who would play tricks.

148
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:29,080
But with Wu Shuang's ability,

149
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,030
it's not a problem to open the Small Kunlun.

150
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:33,720
By that time, if we still refuse to return the dragon bone,

151
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,180
Ding Yunqi will definitely attack us again.

152
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:37,880
You're right.

153
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,190
But if we fight against

154
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:41,870
Commander Hu now,

155
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:47,040
we won't get any advantage.

156
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:49,560
About what happened to Commander Hu,

157
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,780
shall we tell Lady Fengling about it first?

158
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:54,840
You mean you want to get endorsement from Her Ladyship?

159
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:56,360
It's useless.

160
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,830
Without solid evidence,

161
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,180
It's hard for Her Ladyship to offend

162
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,970
a local military officer for the sake of Fengling.

163
00:11:02,970 --> 00:11:05,310
By that time, we might not be able to defeat him

164
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:07,370
and might be attacked by him instead.

165
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,570
We need to think about it.

166
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,540
Don't tell Fengling yet.

167
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,080
Yes.

168
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,600
Report.

169
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,260
Commander Hu is here.

170
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,830
Tell him I'll go down at once.

171
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,170
Take him to the living room.

172
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:25,880
Yes.

173
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,250
According to your instructions,

174
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,910
the Black Feather Team has been on guard all day.

175
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:33,950
Director,

176
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,790
shall we ask more buddies to come here?

177
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,960
Aren't you my buddy?

178
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,730
Commander.

179
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,420
What are you doing?

180
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:24,930
This is good.

181
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:27,160
Let's buy one tomorrow.

182
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:30,650
Commander, why didn't you tell me first

183
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,280
before coming here?

184
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,630
Sorry for not welcoming you properly.

185
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,960
There's no need for courtesy between brothers.

186
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,530
I can see whoever I want.

187
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,170
Just sit down and talk.

188
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,130
Why are you standing there?

189
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,330
Sit.

190
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,030
It's like going home.

191
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,650
As brothers,

192
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:00,210
we can go visit each other when we think of doing so.

193
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,010
Right.

194
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,440
Biao.

195
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,110
Yes.

196
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,250
Prepare wine and dishes. It's rare that the commander is in the mood.

197
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,380
I'll drink with him.

198
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,080
Let's talk about business.

199
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,280
Talk about business.

200
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:12,690
Let's not drink wine.

201
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,160
What's your instruction?

202
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,770
I came here today

203
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,790
to turn myself in.

204
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,010
Commander, you are so good at joking.

205
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:44,540
Why do you turn yourself in?

206
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,760
I'm not kidding.

207
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,650
The Han Tomb you're investigating

208
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,260
was blown up by someone

209
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,980
under my order.

210
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,300
So what?

211
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,600
This is not my ancestral grave.

212
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,400
Don't be so serious, Commander.

213
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:05,400
Did you see that? What he said

214
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,700
is so incisive.

215
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,640
We should have a drink for this.

216
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:09,890
Biao, prepare the wine.

217
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,440
Yes.

218
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,170
Not now.

219
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,150
I haven't finished yet.

220
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,040
My buddy and I are talking here.

221
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,980
Why are they standing here?

222
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,110
Yes.

223
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:29,080
Leave.

224
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,300
Yes.

225
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:36,520
Biao.

226
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,270
Yes.

227
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:38,730
Go drink with the buddies.

228
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:41,180
I'll listen to the commander's instructions.

229
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,890
Yes.

230
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,200
It's a deal.

231
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,730
We'll depart in three days.

232
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,220
Based on my guess,

233
00:14:52,770 --> 00:14:54,700
the Kunlun Mountains isn't a tomb,

234
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:55,880
or

235
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:58,310
it doesn't exist in the form of a tomb.

236
00:14:58,310 --> 00:14:59,440
If it really exists,

237
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,570
it's just a place to keep treasures.

238
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,650
It's not under the ground?

239
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:06,040
It can be anywhere,

240
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:08,190
but it's definitely not a tomb.

241
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,570
It must be more complicated than a tomb.

242
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,210
There must be many more protective measures.

243
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:11,880
Ordinary grave robbers

244
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,350
could never sneak in.

245
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,670
Think about it.

246
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,750
From a grave robber from the Penta-sect,

247
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:18,680
how would he keep treasures according to common practice?

248
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,570
At least, he had to make sure that

249
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:22,370
the treasures wouldn't be taken away by his peers.

250
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,510
Of course.

251
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,700
I don't believe the existence of Kunlun Mountains.

252
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,540
If there is,

253
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,330
it wouldn't be in the Small Kunlun.

254
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,940
Why?

255
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:37,150
It's too close to the city.

256
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,940
Members of the Penta-sect traveled across famous mountains and rivers.

257
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,070
They wouldn't casually choose a location near the city.

258
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,460
What you said is so discouraging.

259
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,890
Are you going to continue?

260
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,070
Of course.

261
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,520
Even if the Small Kunlun is opened as a Han tomb,

262
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:56,270
it'll still be a great

263
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,120
contribution to the government.

264
00:15:58,120 --> 00:15:59,420
As long as I can get the dragon bone back,

265
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,690
I'm willing to contribute to the government.

266
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,870
Wu Shuang, don't worry.

267
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,620
I promise

268
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:06,470
my brother will return the dragon bone to you this time.

269
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,780
If Luo Yunsong sees that you both

270
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,420
trust him so naively,

271
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,710
I think he's going to snigger.

272
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,620
Yunqi.

273
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,770
My brother is not as bad as you said.

274
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,230
Let's not talk about this.

275
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,290
In three days,

276
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,920
I'll go with Wu Shuang.

277
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:40,460
[The Han Tomb in Mount Tianling was robbed.]

278
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:52,800
[Shen Journal]

279
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:52,510
Bro,

280
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,440
to be honest,

281
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,100
I like

282
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,200
this one.

283
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:03,420
What do you think?

284
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,160
Let's gain profit together

285
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:09,180
and get the big fortune.

286
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,920
Do you believe that, too?

287
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,940
You don't believe it?

288
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,339
Sects of the martial artists community

289
00:17:24,339 --> 00:17:25,810
made up strange stories

290
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,040
in order to be mysterious.

291
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:29,240
It's not surprising.

292
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,220
I...

293
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
don't believe it.

294
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,150
You're not being honest, bro.

295
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:39,790
If you don't believe it,

296
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:42,530
then why did you publish the news

297
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,400
to frame Ding Yuanshan?

298
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,400
If I didn't get it wrong,

299
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,410
you just want to tell Ding Yuanshan

300
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,270
you have this item,

301
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:55,050
and that his son Ding Yunqi is also in your hands.

302
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,990
You just want to force him to come out

303
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,350
and open the Kunlun Mountains.

304
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,440
Commander,

305
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,540
you are so insightful.

306
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,180
But except for the last sentence,

307
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,800
what you said before it

308
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,240
is all right.

309
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:25,660
If you are not going to open the Kunlun Mountains,

310
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,850
why do you force Ding Yuanshan to come out?

311
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,970
Ding Yuanshan and I

312
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,800
have a grudge that hasn't been settled.

313
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:40,150
Really?

314
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,670
Yes.

315
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,590
Alright, bro.

316
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,110
The grudge between you and Ding Yuanshan

317
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,540
has nothing to do with me.

318
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,190
I only focus on the surface of things.

319
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,360
I want money.

320
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,470
You two settle the grudge and I want money.

321
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,820
They don't contradict each other.

322
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:03,840
-What you said... -It's right.

323
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,590
Whether the Kunlun Mountains can be opened through the Small Kunlun,

324
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,120
I'll still remember your contribution to it.

325
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:13,840
As I said,

326
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,690
if I get a fortune, you'll have a share of it.

327
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,300
As for the grudge between you and Ding Yuanshan,

328
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,900
if you need me...

329
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,210
See?

330
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,770
Thousands of guns are here.

331
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,950
Anytime.

332
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:31,100
Besides,

333
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,910
we still need Ding Yuanshan

334
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:36,090
to take the blame for us.

335
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,670
Who is the right person to be a scapegoat?

336
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,440
Who?

337
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:45,330
A dead man.

338
00:19:52,390 --> 00:19:54,700
In our minds, Ding Yuanshan

339
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,260
is basically a dead man.

340
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:59,110
Moreover, you won

341
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,050
a good title.

342
00:20:02,390 --> 00:20:04,320
Eliminate the evil for the people.

343
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,220
You've just eliminated a habitual grave robber.

344
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,590
By that time, I can put in a good word

345
00:20:12,590 --> 00:20:14,390
for you in front of Her Ladyship.

346
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,200
Commander.

347
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,350
You and Her Ladyship...

348
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,570
This is the second thing

349
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:32,630
I want to talk with you about.

350
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,060
I've checked

351
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,920
about Her Ladyship's situation.

352
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,730
Don't mind it.

353
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,370
I'm a warrior.

354
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,460
I must

355
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:46,130
know myself as well as the opponent.

356
00:20:47,530 --> 00:20:49,630
I heard that Her Ladyship had asked your sister to

357
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,430
take full charge of opening the Kunlun Mountains.

358
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,510
But does your sister

359
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,450
have any ideas about the treasures

360
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,710
that will be dug out?

361
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:00,640
Do you know?

362
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,090
As for what my sister thinks,

363
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:06,730
it doesn't matter.

364
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,690
What matters is what Her Ladyship thinks.

365
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,230
Since she asked my sister to take charge of this,

366
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,240
it means

367
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:16,850
she's worried about losing the treasure.

368
00:21:18,530 --> 00:21:20,040
That's why

369
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,360
we must keep it from your sister.

370
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,880
Commander,

371
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:30,130
do you really believe that there's the Kunlun Mountains?

372
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,100
I'm just a boor.

373
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,430
But Her Ladyship believes it.

374
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,290
Her Ladyship believes it.

375
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:38,900
Why can't I believe it?

376
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:45,830
Her Ladyship asked my sister to take charge of this.

377
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,720
But I don't think

378
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,360
below the Small Kunlun

379
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,200
is the Kunlun Mountains.

380
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:54,520
Since it's not the Kunlun Mountains,

381
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,840
why do we talk about supervision and instructions?

382
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:58,810
You...

383
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,200
Good brother.

384
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,770
I got it.

385
00:22:15,690 --> 00:22:17,500
This is like...

386
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:18,880
Well...

387
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,110
Talking about something in a tent?

388
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:22,660
Devise strategies within a command tent.

389
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:25,430
Determine the victory while being thousands of miles away.

390
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:26,570
You are...

391
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,130
You are being thousands of miles away.

392
00:22:31,230 --> 00:22:33,200
You're amazing, bro.

393
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,140
It's a deal.

394
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:39,080
It's a deal.

395
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,270
Inside the Small Kunlun isn't the Kunlun Mountains.

396
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,760
If there are treasures in the Small Kunlun,

397
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,030
we'll give some to Her Ladyship.

398
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,590
We won't make things difficult for your sister.

399
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:51,770
For us,

400
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,960
under the blessing of our ancestors,

401
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:59,170
it's right for the descendants like us to enjoy the fruits of their work.

402
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,440
It seems you've got a plan.

403
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:08,650
Her Ladyship gave me full authority to collaborate

404
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:11,380
[Commander Hu]

405
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,350
with your sister in opening the Kunlun Mountains.

406
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:16,000
I'm here to report to your sister today.

407
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:19,950
Just now, we discussed it first.

408
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:23,900
Commander,

409
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:26,690
you're really good at devising strategies.

410
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,790
You determine the victory while being thousands of miles away.

411
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,460
Fengling.

412
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:40,510
You came just in time. Let me make an introduction.

413
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:41,620
Commander Hu.

414
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,960
My sister Fengling.

415
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,970
Report, special commissioner.

416
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,660
I've got Her Ladyship's order to collaborate with you

417
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,970
in opening the Kunlun Mountains by being in charge of

418
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,560
the security and supply.

419
00:23:58,130 --> 00:23:59,760
So it's you whom Her Ladyship has mentioned.

420
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,530
Yes, it's me.

421
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,500
Sorry for the trouble.

422
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:05,140
I'm flattered.

423
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:06,270
We

424
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:08,000
are family.

425
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:12,070
We'll do as you say.

426
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:13,920
Thank you.

427
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:27,890
Cui Yanzhi went to see Commander Hu.

428
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,720
I'm not surprised at all.

429
00:24:31,090 --> 00:24:32,860
Yes, you're right.

430
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,240
Since Cui Yanzhi

431
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,920
could help Commander Hu sell explosives,

432
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,720
it means they must be very close.

433
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,860
By the way,

434
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,840
Commander Hu also went out yesterday.

435
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,680
Guess where he went.

436
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,110
You'll never know.

437
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,520
Come on. Take a guess.

438
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,420
Forget it. Don't guess.

439
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:48,230
He went to...

440
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,360
Luo Yunsong's home.

441
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,660
How do you know?

442
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,730
If you hadn't made it sound so mysterious,

443
00:24:53,730 --> 00:24:55,530
I wouldn't have thought of this.

444
00:24:55,830 --> 00:24:56,590
Right.

445
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:57,940
Superficially,

446
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,700
he only took the lieutenant and four bodyguards and went inside.

447
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,010
In fact, there were a lot of plainclothes officers around there.

448
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:04,060
Guess what?

449
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,060
Luo Yunsong saw him out personally.

450
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:10,290
They bent their arms around each other's should, talking and laughing.

451
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:15,150
Yunqi.

452
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,210
Do you think the tomb

453
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:18,550
was robbed both by Commander Hu

454
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,010
and Luo Yunsong together?

455
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,160
No.

456
00:25:21,490 --> 00:25:23,690
Luo Yunsong wouldn't be so despicable.

457
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,290
Then what's going on with them?

458
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:40,090
He's in big trouble this time.

459
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,750
Why?

460
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,330
According to Commander Hu's previous behavior,

461
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,640
after he has heard the news about the Small Kunlun,

462
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,100
he will surely intervene.

463
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:56,350
He went to see Luo Yunsong at this time

464
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,500
as he wanted to make him a scapegoat.

465
00:26:00,590 --> 00:26:02,990
Once treasures are dug out from the Small Kunlun,

466
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:04,080
Luo Yunsong

467
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:05,720
won't be able to escape from

468
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,250
the crime of embezzlement.

469
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,410
That's great.

470
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:11,480
Let Luo Yunsong know how it feels to be framed.

471
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,740
It'll be hard for him to explain. Let them fight with each other.

472
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,200
Then we can vent our anger.

473
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,280
I'm afraid

474
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,810
he won't even have a chance to defend himself.

475
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,110
You mean

476
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,470
Commander Hu wants to kill him?

477
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,480
If he doesn't kill him, how can he prove his crime?

478
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:32,930
He deserves to die.

479
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,930
Right? It's the retribution.

480
00:26:35,070 --> 00:26:37,010
It's all because he kept going after Master Ding.

481
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:37,930
No.

482
00:26:38,270 --> 00:26:39,530
Luo Yunsong can't die.

483
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,500
He still has the dragon bone.

485
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,410
Do you want to help him?

486
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:48,770
Before we get the dragon bone back,

487
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,900
he must be safe.

488
00:26:53,970 --> 00:26:54,810

♫Won't miss the blooming flowers and full moon♫

517

-Don't move. -Don't move.

519

-Don't move. -Don't move. Don't move.

00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,380
-Sit there. -Don't move. Don't move.

521
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:49,350
Don't move.

522
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,700
-Don't move. Don't move. -Sit there.

523
00:30:03,770 --> 00:30:05,240
Here are the police.

524
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:07,800
Don't move.

525
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,860
Don't think too much.

526
00:30:10,990 --> 00:30:12,800
Watch out for the gunshot.

527
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:15,530
Understand?

528
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,920
They can't move but  you can.

529
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,040
You don't understand?

530
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,730
I want you to move.

531
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:35,060
Music.

532
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,040
Stop it.

533
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,700
I'm quite clear about

534
00:31:09,290 --> 00:31:10,800
who you are.

535
00:31:12,390 --> 00:31:13,740
You might also know

536
00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:16,300
who I am.

537
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,320
I'm not quite clear about

538
00:31:19,490 --> 00:31:20,500
why you are here.

539
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,180
But I kind of know the reason.

540
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,860
So I don't care what

541
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:26,190
sordid business you are doing here today.

542
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:28,020
But from now on,

543
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,370
you have to do whatever I say.

544
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:32,650
Do you understand?

545
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:48,300
I said don't move. Don't you understand?

546
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,150
Okay. You all understand now.

547
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,580
Today,

548
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:09,470
I won't kill you.

549
00:32:10,350 --> 00:32:11,860
Don't be so nervous.

550
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:14,590
If you want to walk out of here,

551
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,310
it's quite simple.

552
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:23,410
Leave all the things

553
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,060
that you shouldn't have taken with you

554
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,900
here.

555
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,500
Then you can walk out from the gate.

556
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,880
You can come and go without worries.

557
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:37,360
This foreigner

558
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,740
may not understand.

559
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:39,830
If he doesn't understand,

560
00:32:39,830 --> 00:32:41,930
those who are beside him help to translate it.

561
00:32:41,930 --> 00:32:43,320
He won't let us go

562
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,550
unless we empty our pockets.

563
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:49,160
If those who are upstairs and downstairs

564
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:51,160
understand it, please take action.

565
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,040
Luo Yunsong's brother, Luo Jiutian.

566
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,560
Luo Jiutian?

567
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:09,820
So this brat

568
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:11,750
has come to rob my place.

569
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:33,130
This is not valuable.

570
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,310
It's useless.

571
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,200
Well...

572
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,330
Foreign girl, what are you drinking?

573
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:38,250
Give it to me.

574
00:33:38,670 --> 00:33:39,770
Okay, okay, okay.

575
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,330
Hurry up.

576
00:33:42,750 --> 00:33:43,970
Quick. Quick.

577
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,220
Is your skin always so white?

578
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:50,900
Why are you running?

579
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,360
I haven't touched you yet.

580
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:31,510
[Police Department]

581
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,790
[Wait for you at the dock]

582
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,760
Sorry, director.

583
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:04,810
I'll double the number of patrol agents tonight.

584
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:05,610
No.

585
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,870
It's useless.

586
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:08,970
What a joke.

587
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:59,580
You're like a fairy in the heaven.

588
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,150
Why did you come to the secular world?

589
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,220
If it were a few years ago

590
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,470
when I was young and ignorant,

591
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,910
I would believe what you said.

592
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:23,730
I've long heard that you are very beautiful.

593
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,960
I thought it was a false rumor.

594
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,580
After seeing you today, I regret it so much.

595
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,890
I should have believed it.

596
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:34,860
If I did, we would have met long ago.

597
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,830
When the time comes, we would meet.

598
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:41,540
Now we meet, aren't we?

599
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:43,850
I haven't asked who you are.

600
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,790
I'm so careless.

601
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,010
I was so attracted by your beautiful face.

602
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,670
I forgot to introduce myself.

603
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,840
I'm Luo Jiutian.

604
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:57,580
L-u-o for Luo, and j-i-u-t-i-a-n for Jiutian.

605
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,910
So you are the famous Master Tian.

606
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,260
No wonder.

607
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,460
Who could have such ostentation and extravagance?

608
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:11,650
You know me?

609
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:13,500
Of course.

610
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:15,140
Everyone in the Shanghai Bund

611
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,730
knows you.

612
00:37:17,450 --> 00:37:19,110
I'm not from the countryside.

613
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:22,360
I can hear what I need to hear.

614
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:27,190
I wonder why

615
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,580
you came to see me today.

616
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,500
I'm timid.

617
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,470
Don't scare me.

618
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,950
Don't be scared.

619
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,010
I came to you

620
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:42,940
for a small business.

621
00:37:44,450 --> 00:37:45,460
Business?

622
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,060
I like it.

623
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,320
I wonder

624
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:52,060
what good business you are going to do with me.

625
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,430
Arms and ammunition.

626
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,030
Why do you men

627
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:03,440
like guns and cannons?

628
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,740
Can't you make things like

629
00:38:05,830 --> 00:38:06,960
stockings

630
00:38:07,430 --> 00:38:08,640
and perfume?

631
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:10,910
In this world,

632
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:14,400
it's easiest to earn money from women?

633
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:17,040
What you said is really enlightening.

634
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,550
I know what you like.

635
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,860
I'll bring it next time.

636
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,460
It's not big trade this time.

637
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,090
No cannons.

638
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,440
Just a small number of guns. Just a small number.

639
00:38:32,370 --> 00:38:33,550
You're the best businessman

640
00:38:33,550 --> 00:38:35,190
I've ever seen.

641
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:39,720
Alright.

642
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:41,150
Tell me.

643
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,890
How many do you want to sell?

644
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,510
I'll make an exception

645
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,690
to buy the goods personally.

646
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,600
Not many.

647
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:51,940
Just...

648
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,470
Just 30 little yellow croakers.

649
00:38:57,570 --> 00:38:59,970
Not many. Not many. There's not much money.

650
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,000
But the quantity of the goods

651
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,350
is a bit small.

652
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,290
Thirty little yellow croakers

653
00:39:10,470 --> 00:39:12,480
are enough for an army.

654
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,670
For your goods,

655
00:39:15,210 --> 00:39:17,060
If I'm bold enough,

656
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:19,500
I could buy them all.

657
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,230
You...

658
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:24,230
Ma'am, you don't need to carry a gun.

659
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,060
You're an army.

660
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,720
Don't light cigarettes so casually.

661
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,540
If you do it in a wrong way,

662
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,380
something bad will happen.

663
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,310
But my fire is already burning up.

664
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,290
If I hold it back,

665
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,310
it'll be harmful for my health.

666
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,320
I think

667
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,550
you must have encountered some difficulties,

668
00:39:57,550 --> 00:40:00,490
and that's why you came to do business like this with me.

669
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:01,550
But think about it.

670
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,760
You came here today,

671
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,410
and scared away all my guests.

672
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,590
In the future,

673
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,670
who will have the guts to come here to have fun?

674
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:13,880
As you know,

675
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:15,860
the guests here

676
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,000
are not decent people.

677
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,040
Naturally, what they do

678
00:40:20,770 --> 00:40:22,410
is not decent.

679
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:25,730
I'm just afraid that

680
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:27,850
if someone takes this to heart

681
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:31,440
and feels over-confident as to fight against you,

682
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:33,870
that will be quite unnecessary.

683
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:35,260
Do you think so?

684
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,350
Master Tian.

685
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,450
Be careful.

686
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,560
You're not only pretty,

687
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:48,740
but also eloquent.

688
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,020
Being eloquent

689
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,700
is just a skill on talking.

690
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,170
It doesn't count.

691
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:58,400
We are both members of the society.

692
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,710
Only by doing a good job

693
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,310
can we bring honor to ourselves.

694
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,380
Am I right?

695
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:24,230
It's rare that you came here today.

696
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,450
Sorry for the negligence.

697
00:41:27,630 --> 00:41:29,230
I want to treat you to a drink.

698
00:41:30,410 --> 00:41:31,500
I wonder

699
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,140
if you'll accept it.

700
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:41,070
Ma'am.

701
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,270
Are you

702
00:41:45,780 --> 00:41:47,290
treating me as a child?

703
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:02,190
I'm treating you as a child, so my attitude is like this.

704
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,610
If I don't treat you as a child,

705
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,750
today,

706
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:12,290
you won't be able to get out of this door.

707
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:17,360
Don't move! Put the gun down!

708
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,490
-Don't move! -Don't move! Don't move!

709
00:42:19,750 --> 00:42:21,880
-Don't move! -Don't move! Don't move!

710
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,460
-Don't move! Put it down! -Put the gun down!

711
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,590
-Don't move! -Put the gun down!

712
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:27,060
-Don't move! -Don't move! Don't move!

713
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,500
-I told you to put the gun down. -Did you hear me?

714
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,550
-Don't move! -Don't move!
