[Episode 23]

4
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,060
No wants, no desires.

5
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,690
No thoughts, no curses.

6
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:50,180
No worries, no complaints.

7
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,250
No Four Noble Truths.

8
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,460
No.

9
00:01:53,729 --> 00:01:54,420
Brother.

10
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,740
I can't take it anymore.

11
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,140
I can't bear it.

12
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,460
You have to bear it.

13
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,740
You have to endure what you can't endure, right?

14
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,660
It's not easy to learn kung fu.

15
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:04,900
Back then,

16
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,100
I stood on the edge of a vat

17
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,580
for two hours every time.

18
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,940
If I hadn't stood steadily, I would have fallen into the water

19
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,820
and would have had no dinner, right?

20
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,380
That's why I can learn kung fu

21
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,380
well.

22
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,180
I only teach you.

23
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,620
I won't teach others.

24
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,780
Ms. Wu Shuang,

25
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,700
did you also learn kung fu like this?

26
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:25,380
Almost.

27
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,260
Brother.

28
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:30,740
If I keep enduring it,

29
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:31,940
I can't cook dinner.

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,260
You need to

31
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,420
learn kung fu

32
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,420
step by step.

33
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,300
You can't bite off more than you can chew, right?

34
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,420
What are we having for dinner, Master San?

35
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:47,860
I'll think about it.

36
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,810
Think about what you'll cook for dinner.

37
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:02,780
You...

38
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,820
What are you doing?

39
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:15,780
Fengling.

40
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,700
What's going on?

41
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,300
I can't see anything.

42
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,180
Fengling.

43
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,460
Is it the Black Feather Team?

44
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,940
There was a call from the Black Feather Team. They've been ambushed.

45
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,970
The number of the opponents is unknown, and they used crossbows.

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,260
The Black Feather Team has two injured men.

47
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:32,540
The opponents have retreated.

48
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,940
Who ambushed my Black Feather Team?

49
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,940
Aren't we all standing here?

50
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,460
Who can ambush the Black Feather Team?

51
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,380
You're being shameless.

52
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,530
You are here,

53
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:47,579
but none of your men are here.

54
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,620
What's wrong, Brother?

55
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,900
Our men were ambushed.

56
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,700
That's our ghoul signal flare.

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,860
Ghoul signal flare?

58
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:11,970
Let's go.

59
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:51,930
Be gentle.

60
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:25,580
Wu Shuang.

61
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,260
Can you tell us

62
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,140
what you said

63
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,420
when you met your master?

64
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,620
I...

65
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,260
Isn't it obvious?

66
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,740
Mound-digging did it.

67
00:05:42,659 --> 00:05:43,409
You have no evidence.

68
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:44,700
How could you say we did it?

69
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,620
As soon as ghouls arrived in Shanghai,

70
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,060
your master set a trap to ambush them, right?

71
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,140
That's because...

72
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,420
If I remember correctly,

73
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:51,780
that was also a sneak attack.

74
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,500
Your master is good at ambushing others.

75
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,260
Also,

76
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,900
in order to vent his anger,

77
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,500
your master led my brother in opium business

78
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,490
and caused his death, right?

79
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,300
My eldest brother was dismissed because of it,

80
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,340
and your master openly came to provoke us.

81
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,660
Isn't that right?

82
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,220
Now,

83
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,860
he followed us all the way here.

84
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,780
He said he wanted to protect Yunqi.

85
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:15,570
That's right.

86
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:16,780
In his eyes,

87
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,290
we are all hidden dangers.

88
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,940
So I didn't doubt that he suddenly took action.

89
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,700
But I don't understand

90
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,020
why he chose to take action

91
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,100
right after he met you.

92
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:29,700
I'm afraid

93
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,460
you're the only one who knows the whole story.

94
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,300
You're talking nonsense!

95
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,460
We all know whether I'm talking nonsense or not.

96
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,500
Master Sun,

97
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,380
do you think what I said makes sense?

98
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,060
You're right.

99
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,500
Brother, you don't believe it, do you?

100
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,780
Wu Shuang, I trust you 100 percent.

101
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,740
But according to your master's usual behavior,

102
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,780
it's not surprised that he did such a thing.

103
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:54,820
You...

104
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:55,690
Wu Shuang.

105
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,060
I'm talking about your master.

106
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,340
It's impossible for you to do it.

107
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,260
How is it?

108
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,210
Everyone can see it clearly.

109
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:04,730
Yunqi.

110
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,100
I've called the Black Feather Team.

111
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,380
For the sake of safety,

112
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,980
I asked them to rush to the town.

113
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,580
If they were ambushed,

114
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:11,660
they'd do their best to fight back.

115
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:13,340
Do you have any objection?

116
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,450
Master Sun,

117
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,460
do you want your men to gather in the town too?

118
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,780
Let our men take care of each other

119
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,620
so that we won't be ambushed by others.

120
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,940
Who are you talking about?

121
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,220
Who else besides the mound-digging will ambush us?

122
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,340
My Black Feather Team are equipped with German weapons.

123
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,530
If it weren't for the sneak attack, no one would have hurt them.

124
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,820
I'll get even with you when I see your master.

125
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,420
You don't need to wait until you see my master.

126
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,060
I'm from Mound-digging Sect.

127
00:07:39,409 --> 00:07:40,780
If any of you have a problem with mound-digging,

128
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,970
come at me. I'll take it.

129
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:47,220
Wu Shuang.

130
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,100
Don't be angry.

131
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,740
Fengling is just telling how she feels.

132
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,340
Don't misunderstand each other.

133
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,740
It's not your turn to pretend to be nice.

134
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,780
Since we've come to this point,

135
00:07:58,260 --> 00:07:59,260
even a fool won't misunderstand.

136
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,980
If you have any tricks, just do it.

137
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,500
If I blink,

138
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,020
I don't deserve to eat the food of the mound-digging for 20 years.

139
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,500
Don't move!

140
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,420
Luo Yunsong.

141
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,780
Mound-digging is mound-digging.

142
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:22,940
Wu Shuang is Wu Shuang.

143
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:23,940
Don't involve her.

144
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,260
I am the mound-digging.

145
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,100
You...

146
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:27,500
Look.

147
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,900
You admitted it.

148
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,860
Are you done?

149
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,100
Is it fun?

150
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,540
Brother.

151
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,420
The Black Feather Team and Brother's men were ambushed.

152
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,410
Both sides are not sure

153
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,220
who the attackers are.

154
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,500
Can we come to a conclusion

155
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,220
with our own perspectives?

156
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,340
It's indeed inappropriate to claim

157
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,780
the mound-digging did it.

158
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,020
You've been discussing who the attackers are.

159
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:20,820
Have you ever thought

160
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,140
what is the aim of the attackers?

161
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,060
Are they trying to disturb or surround us?

162
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,540
According to what you just said,

163
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,980
I think

164
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,380
the greater probability is disturbance.

165
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,460
That's strange.

166
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,420
They just want to tell us

167
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:39,260
their existence.

168
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,260
Then what exactly do they want?

169
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:44,300
Mr. Luo,

170
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,420
you were in the army.

171
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,220
What do you think?

172
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,980
Your analysis is right.

173
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,050
Their aim is not

174
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,460
to surround and kill us.

175
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,820
It's a standard disturbance.

176
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,660
Normally,

177
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:02,730
there are only two purposes of disturbing enemies.

178
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,820
Either delay

179
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:06,020
or urge them to speed up.

180
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,220
That's right.

181
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:12,980
Do you think they are delaying

182
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,940
or urging us?

183
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,220
We don't have any actual actions.

184
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,940
From this point of view,

185
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,500
it should be the latter.

186
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,540
Urge.

187
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,900
That means someone is anxious.

188
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,580
It must be.

189
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,860
Also, Fengling.

190
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:30,500
I remember when we went out,

191
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,100
we've made a pact.

192
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,380
What you did just now

193
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:35,260
not only affected our unity,

194
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,060
but also broke the contract. So...

195
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,740
Yunqi.

196
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:45,260
Fengling was indeed impulsive.

197
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,420
But she did it

198
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,980
for our safety.

199
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,780
What she said

200
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,460
is just a suggestion.

201
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,570
You're still in command.

202
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,100
We'll follow your arrangements.

203
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:01,820
Wu Shuang.

204
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,860
If what Fengling said

205
00:11:04,930 --> 00:11:06,260
hurt you,

206
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,500
I apologize on her behalf.

207
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,820
Whoever wants to fight against the mound-digging,

208
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,340
defeat me first.

209
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,540
Don't worry. We won't do it again.

210
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,780
Right, Fengling?

211
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,060
What should we do next?

212
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,020
They have

213
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,100
our whereabouts.

214
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,420
Actually, I agree with

215
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,260
Fengling.

216
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,380
Gather the two teams.

217
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,100
The Black Feather Team guard the gate of the town.

218
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,300
Brother's men

219
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,980
guard the foot of the northwest mountain.

220
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:46,820
Wu Shuang,

221
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:48,340
follow me to the Dengkun Pavilion tomorrow.

222
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:53,940
Also,

223
00:11:55,460 --> 00:11:57,220
don't do this kind of thing again.

224
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:26,900
Brother.

225
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,180
Why did you apologize

226
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,610
to Wu Shuang humbly?

227
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,220
Am I wrong?

228
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,970
Yunqi is partial towards her.

229
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,900
Without analyzing who the enemies are,

230
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,100
he only analyzed the enemies' aim.

231
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,540
This is obviously a conceptual shift.

232
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,180
Fengling.

233
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,420
You're right.

234
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,690
I

235
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,220
don't want to argue with you

236
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,940
about this matter.

237
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,620
I only have one question.

238
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,500
What is the purpose of our trip?

239
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,580
To find the Kunlun Mountains.

240
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,100
So for this goal,

241
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,290
as long as I can get closer to it every day,

242
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,260
no matter how much I suffer

243
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,450
or how humble I am,

244
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,180
I think it's worthwhile.

245
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,300
I see.

246
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,220
I was willful.

247
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:16,780
You really understand?

248
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:25,220
Yunqi will enter the Dengkun Pavilion tomorrow.

249
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,660
What is Dengkun Pavilion?

250
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,860
Is it important?

251
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,180
Yes, it is.

252
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,020
It's very important.

253
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,220
Don't raise your butt.

254
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:51,660
The Dengkun Pavilion really exists?

255
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,340
I thought it was a rumor.

256
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,740
Let me take a rest, Wu Shuang.

257
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:55,740
I wanted to learn more about it

258
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,660
from you.

259
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:58,860
That's not right.

260
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,260
Why didn't Yanzhi marked it

261
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,140
on the map?

262
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:03,460
Even Yanzhi doesn't know it?

263
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:06,220
At that time, I only said I wanted to take the Book of Ban.

264
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,530
Yanzhi must have drawn it

265
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,940
according to the place of the book.

266
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,020
Although this building is on the map,

267
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,620
but the name is not marked.

268
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,180
If it was really the Dengkun Pavilion,

269
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,700
Yanzhi would know it.

270
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,050
How did you know it, Yunqi?

271
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,680
Wu Shang's master told her.

272
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,580
Here.

273
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,380
Yunqi.

274
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:25,140
What do you think about this matter?

275
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,460
He sent Wu Shuang to follow me.

276
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,420
I'm not surprised at all.

277
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,300
But I really don't understand

278
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,140
why he attacked you suddenly.

279
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,690
Zhou Qiuhai

280
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,500
is very stubborn.

281
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:42,210
I learned it at the dock.

282
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,500
We have to be careful.

283
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:45,020
The trap he set for Jiutian

284
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,020
is really good.

285
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:49,700
-Uncle Zhou loves his disciples so much. -Raise your arms.

286
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:52,050
-The mound-digging lost several brothers. -Keep them flat.

287
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,380
I understand how much he did

288
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,260
to Luo Yunsong.

289
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:57,420
Then tell me,

290
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,580
should my brothers and I

291
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,650
keep an eye on him?

292
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,940
Luo Yunsong knows us well.

293
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,500
I don't know where he got so much information.

294
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:07,700
I mentioned the Dengkun Pavilion to him today.

295
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,890
He reacted a lot.

296
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:12,860
If the Dengkun Pavilion is really there,

297
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:13,930
Brother,

298
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,260
you really need to guard here.

299
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,890
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

300
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:18,940
Don't worry, Yunqi.

301
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,450
My brothers and I will prepare for it overnight.

302
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,180
Before you and Wu Shuang come out tomorrow,

303
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,660
no one can come up from the back mountain.

304
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,220
I'll leave the back mountain to you.

305
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:12,940
Mr. Luo.

306
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,920
Didn't you go to defend with the Black Feather Team?

307
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,950
I came to tell you something.

308
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,920
Have you made up your mind

309
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,900
about my yesterday's request?

310
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:27,560
I agree.

311
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,710
Thank you, Yunqi.

312
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,770
I'm going to defend.

313
00:16:33,310 --> 00:16:34,240
Be careful.

314
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,690
What's in the Dengkun Pavilion

315
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,330
that can make him care too much?

316
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,850
If your master hadn't said it,

317
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,660
I wouldn't have known this is the Dengkun Pavilion.

318
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,180
Is the Dengkun Pavilion famous?

319
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,790
Rumor has it that this is the entrance to the Kunlun Mountains.

320
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:58,760
No way.

321
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:01,620
It's just a rumor.

322
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,340
No one knows what it looks like inside.

323
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:04,560
So,

324
00:17:05,099 --> 00:17:06,069
I want to see

325
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:07,920
what's inside. Let's go.

326
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:21,690
[Deshun Restaurant]

327
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,560
Is there anything going on?

328
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:21,740
No.

329
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:27,280
Brother.

330
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,670
Where have you been?

331
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,260
Nothing.

332
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,110
I just went out and took a look.

333
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:36,980
Brother,

334
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,120
we need to talk.

335
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:40,800
About what?

336
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,210
Many things are weird this time.

337
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,810
Yunqi has secrets.

338
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,980
Wu Shuang has secrets.

339
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,960
I can accept it.

340
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:51,970
But what I can't accept is

341
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,440
you're hiding something from me too.

342
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:55,420
Brother.

343
00:17:56,130 --> 00:17:57,430
Don't you want to say something to me?

344
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,650
You think too much.

345
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:02,640
I'm hiding nothing from you.

346
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,530
Tell me then.

347
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,130
What did you say to Yunqi?

348
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:10,580
I saw it clearly.

349
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:12,470
Also,

350
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,190
during this trip,

351
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:15,750
you've been being humble.

352
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,220
You did it not just to get

353
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,480
the information of the Kunlun Mountains.

354
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,060
I don't want to be kept in the dark.

355
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,370
There are too many things between you and Yunqi

356
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,250
which I don't know.

357
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,450
I want you to tell me honestly.

358
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:39,850
Don't look at him.

359
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:41,700
He didn't say a word.

360
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:44,520
I wouldn't listen even if he told me.

361
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,870
I want you to tell me.

362
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:53,630
The time is not ripe.

363
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:55,270
I'll tell you

364
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:56,820
when the time is ripe.

365
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,100
Maybe

366
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,160
I will use it today.

367
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:10,010
Brother, you know

368
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,810
what it means when the gun goes off.

369
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,670
I don't want anything to happen

370
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:16,810
and let both of us have regrets.

371
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,390
Give me the gun.

372
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:25,420
Tell me.

373
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,810
What are you hiding from me?

374
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:33,020
Brother.

375
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,120
Think carefully before you tell me.

376
00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:36,510
Don't lie to me.

377
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,740
I''m begging you.

378
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,220
Otherwise, I really don't know

379
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:45,160
who I can trust in this world.

380
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,050
Fine.

381
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,060
Let me tell you.

382
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:56,370
Give me the gun first.

383
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:06,160
Do you know why

384
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,500
I was looking for Ding Yuanshan?

385
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:09,860
Because

386
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,900
he killed our father.

387
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,550
Yunqi.

388
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,200
The door and windows are decorations.

389
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,120
They can't be opened.

390
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,510
They're all made of iron.

391
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,610
How can we get in?

392
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,710
This is interesting.

393
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:56,450
What's wrong?

394
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:58,760
Wu Shuang.

395
00:21:58,970 --> 00:21:59,850
Listen carefully.

396
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:01,610
All the wind chimes

397
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,000
were tuned accurately.

398
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:05,060
They're very standard five pitches.

399
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:07,160
Five pitches?

400
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,460
Yes, five pitches.

401
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,270
Gong, shang, jue, zhi, and yu.

402
00:22:25,850 --> 00:22:26,770
Indeed.

403
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,080
Let me test you.

404
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,680
What are the five elements the five pitches correspond to?

405
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,230
I know that.

406
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,240
Metal, wood, water, fire and earth.

407
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:34,920
What are the locations respectively?

408
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,700
Gong is the center. Shang is the west.

409
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:41,470
Jue is the east. Zhi is the south.

410
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Yu is the north, right?

411
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,570
Yes.

412
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:45,800
Listen carefully again.

413
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:01,670
I can hear it.

414
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,440
They're repeating the same melody

415
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,910
over and over again.

416
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:05,910
Yes.

417
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,220
Then?

418
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:10,410
My father forced me to learn a song when I was young.

419
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:11,920
Ode to the Supreme Heaven Official.

420
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:15,620
How do you know that?

421
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:17,040
I heard it from my master.

422
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,850
He said that it's one of the enlightening songs for heaven officials.

423
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:21,500
But we outsiders don't have the chance to hear it.

424
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,450
The melody I've learned

425
00:23:26,870 --> 00:23:28,260
is exactly the same as the melody

426
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,180
of these wind chimes.

427
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,260
I know.

428
00:23:35,270 --> 00:23:36,280
Combing the melody of the song

429
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,210
with the melody of these wind chimes

430
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,360
is the way to break the Dengkun Pavilion, right?

431
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:42,450
Wu Shuang.

432
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:43,670
Can you help me lock

433
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,350
the four wind chimes where gong is from?

434
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,880
You're giving me a hard time.

435
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,310
How am I supposed to do this?

436
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,910
Use your Jingang Rope.

437
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,350
This...

438
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,500
Fine, I'll try.

439
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,530
Yunqi, I can only lock three.

440
00:24:08,030 --> 00:24:08,830
I'll lock the next one.

441
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,360
Pull.

442
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,770
Do you believe Yunqi's words?

443
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,840
Yunqi has always been honest.

444
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,190
He believes Ding Yuanshan didn't do it.

445
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,830
Otherwise,

446
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,970
he wouldn't dare to bring us along.

447
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,820
Do you believe Ding Yuanshan's words?

448
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,750
In our courtyard,

449
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,440
I found the willow catkins of the Ding family.

450
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,580
People can lie,

451
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,350
but things don't lie.

452
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:33,880
Brother.

453
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,190
If we could prove Ding Yuanshan

454
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:37,820
really killed our father,

455
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,090
what would you do to Yunqi?

456
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:44,880
A son should pay the price for his father.

457
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:46,690
Brother.

458
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:47,940
Brother.

459
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:49,920
Wu Shuang and Ding Yunqi have entered the Dengkun Pavilion.

460
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,140
Have you seen it clearly?

461
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:52,270
Yes, I have.

462
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,660
Guard here with Fengling.

463
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:54,620
I'll take a look.

464
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:55,670
Yes.

465
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:57,770
Brother.

466
00:25:59,910 --> 00:26:01,590
What's in the Dengkun Pavilion?

467
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:03,530
When I enter there and see it clearly,

468
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,080
I'll tell you what's inside.

469
00:26:23,230 --> 00:26:23,980
Brother.

470
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,840
Since last night,

471
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,260
no one has come.

472
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,550
It's better if no one is here.

473
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,980
If they come,

474
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,530
it's not easy to deal with them.

475
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:38,010
It won't be fun if only weak men come.

476
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:40,530
Brothers have been preparing for it since last night.

477
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,880
They're waiting for some ruthless men.

478
00:26:46,110 --> 00:26:46,870
Brother, who would come

479
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:48,670
if

480
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:50,060
there were some men coming here?

481
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:51,910
Who else will come?

482
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,920
It must be that old man Zhou Qiuhai.

483
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,030
That old man is really strange.

484
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,470
He ambushed us

485
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:01,230
like a thief.

486
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,000
He left after shooting two crossbows.

487
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,180
If he had attacked,

488
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,940
we would have lost more.

489
00:27:07,910 --> 00:27:09,130
This old man is really timid.

490
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,020
He never dared to keep fighting.

491
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,390
Someone is coming.

492
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,600
Senior Yutian.

493
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,910
Master didn't say anything along the way.

494
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,040
We are...

495
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:32,860
Master didn't say it,

496
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:33,990
but there was a gunshot last night.

497
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,010
He must be worried about Wu Shuang.

498
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,490
If anything happened to Junior,

499
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,660
Master will...

500
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,220
-Do you understand? -Yes, I do.

501
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,730
Senior.

502
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,500
Is there anything going on ahead?

503
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,890
What?

504
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:48,230
Are you scared?

505
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:49,820
Not really.

506
00:27:50,450 --> 00:27:51,250
I'm a little nervous.

507
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:52,810
It's okay.

508
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,190
Stay close.

509
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,030
Yunqi.

510
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,080
Yunqi.

511
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:17,240
Why are you in a daze?

512
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:21,570
You're so beautiful.

513
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,140
Of course.

514
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:25,980
I know.

515
00:30:27,150 --> 00:30:27,700
Take a look.

516
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,210
How can we get in through this door?

517
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:32,490
OK.

518
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:47,270
Wu Shuang.

519
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,570
Can you help me go up there?

520
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:03,920
Yunqi.

521
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,760
Do you understand?

522
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,920
All the wind chimes outside just now

523
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,060
use different weight to differentiate the five pitches.

524
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,540
Only by combining them with Ode to the Supreme Heaven Official

525
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,420
can I crack it.

526
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,280
It turns out that the contraptions here

527
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:20,130
are designed by Heaven officials.

528
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,930
If my guess is right,

529
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:23,240
here,

530
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,210
only Heaven officials and movers

531
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,510
can crack it.

532
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:27,940
Don't worry.

533
00:32:28,650 --> 00:32:29,450
Give me some time.

534
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,480

Did my brother mention the Dengkun Pavilion to you?

556
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,340
You heard it just now.

557
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:17,060
My brother said he would tell me

558
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:17,940
everything.

559
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,630
So don't hide what you know from me.

560
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,440
I've never heard the name of the Dengkun Pavilion before.

561
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:27,010
I promise.

562
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,330
Brother.

563
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:57,670
They've entered the circle.

00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:13,970
Brother.

565
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,600
Did he find anything?

566
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:17,700
No.

567
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,470
Zhou Qiuhai is very cunning.

568
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,560
If he found something,

569
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,070
he'd turn around and leave.

570
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:23,670
Don't enter forests.

571
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,390
That's what everyone in the martial artists community knows.

572
00:38:25,770 --> 00:38:26,440
Don't worry.

573
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:27,700
Wait for them to come in.

574
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:30,300
The forest is getting denser.

575
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:31,860
Be careful.

576
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:32,870
Yes.

577
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,920
Senior, be alert.

578
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:37,820
Be careful.

This is...

00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,390
Ten-mile red dowry.

581
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,820
Ten-mile red dowry?

582
00:39:37,420 --> 00:39:38,590
What formation is it?

583
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,950
I haven't heard it from my master before.

584
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,260
It's not a formation.

585
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,270
In Jiangnan times,

586
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:47,160
daughters would be married off with the ten-mile dowry.

587

[You Qi]

590
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,130
So

591
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:06,770
this is the ancestral temple of movers.

592
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,310
No wonder the Dengkun Pavilion is so mysterious.

00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:16,940
are designed by Heaven officials.

596
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:19,960
Ancestral temple?

597
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,150
Why does the ancestral temple

598
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:23,450
decorated like a wedding house?

599
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:31,640
Movers are all girls.

600
00:40:32,770 --> 00:40:34,960
They're restricted by the rules and will be widows forever.

601
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,530
So,

602
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,260
the ancestral temple was decorated like a wedding house

603
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,280
in order to let them have no regrets.

604
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,120
I must end everything here.

605
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,170
Everyone

606
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:53,980
has the right to love others.
