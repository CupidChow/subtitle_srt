[Episode 26]

4
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,940
Old Weird.

5
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,100
We haven't talked in a while.

6
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:03,650
Tell me.

7
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,960
What are your plans for the future?

8
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,509
Here, Young Master.

9
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,320
Have a piece of beef.

10
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:13,980
What can I do?

11
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:17,300
It's good enough to be alive.

12
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,070
Don't be nervous all day.

13
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:20,660
It's okay.

14
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,630
No, Young Master.

15
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,110
I was scared sick

16
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,110
by those people with guns.

17
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,970
Back then, Commander Hu

18
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,400
told me with a smile that

19
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,670
he would take my four disciples

20
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,100
to take photos.

21
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:36,070
Later, his bodyguard

22
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:37,040
told me that

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,770
they've sent the four disciples to Small Kunlun.

24
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,700
He shot me with a machine gun

25
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,210
with a smile.

26
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,730
Look at the photos published.

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,120
We

28
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,310
dug such a big tomb.

29
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,070
We dug it up just like that.

30
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,170
We have to find someone tough

31
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,680
to help us take the consequences.

32
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,730
Besides,

33
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,500
I dug a few more tombs before that.

34
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,390
I need someone to cover it up for me too.

35
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,620
These four are tomb raiders.

36
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,080
They are suitable for this.

37
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:12,940
Commander.

38
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,340
Commander.

39
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,900
Young Master.

40
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,560
Give him his crutch.

41
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,130
Young Master.

42
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,470
How is it?

43
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,480
Dad.

44
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,240
The crutch is so hard.

45
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,850
The root you gave me is so firm.

46
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,230
I like it so much.

47
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,520
Thank you, dad.

48
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,530
That day, your brother held your crutch

49
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,210
in front of your grave

50
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,020
and swore to avenge you.

51
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:01,920
He is

52
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,710
just like that.

53
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,390
He doesn't really regard me as his brother.

54
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:05,590
If I were in his heart,

55
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,400
I wouldn't be here today.

56
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,390
There's something I don't understand.

57
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,940
That day in the prison,

58
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,850
when you played Farewell My Concubine,

59
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,899
why didn't you ask your brother for the dragon bone?

60
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,000
Maybe he would have given you the dragon bone

61
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,530
since his heart got melted.

62
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:27,240
You think he would give me the dragon bone?

63
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,700
He needs the dragon bone to save his own life.

64
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,880
Or his sister's, at most.

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,550
Even He Biao may get it,

66
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:35,510
but I won't.

67
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,240
That's why I didn't say that.

68
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:42,240
So you are not completely shameless.

69
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:44,000
Son.

70
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:45,430
Remember.

71
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,850
We don't have to

72
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,740
have shame.

73
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,770
Just give it up if needed.

74
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,980
As long as you get what you want.

75
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,840
Dad, you are right.

76
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:00,880
Look at me.

77
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,480
I'm always a shameless person.

78
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,580
Why did I want my dignity that day?

79
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,080
Commander.

80
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:13,270
That day,

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,210
I killed them four.

82
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,650
Do you still

83
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,870
have a grudge against me?

84
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,660
How could we?

85
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,050
They were useless.

86
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:29,310
Useless people should be killed, right?

87
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,120
Yes.

88
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,240
You're tough.

89
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:43,220
You are capable of big deals.

90
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,159
But you have to be even tougher.

91
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,170
When the tough meets the tough,

92
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:50,370
you'll be broken if you are a bit softer.

93
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,670
Got it, Dad.

94
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,890
From now on,

95
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,710
don't make me think you're useless.

96
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,020
No.

97
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:01,910
Young Master.

98
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:03,420
Do you think Ding Yunqi is

99
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,640
a little silly?

100
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,320
Why?

101
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:08,920
See, Ding Yunqi wants

102
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,480
the Soul Pursuit Order of Mound-digging, right?

103
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,950
Then why did he save Zhou Qiuhai

104
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,190
during mountain-moving?

105
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,830
I think that bastard Zhou Qiuhai

106
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,850
cares about his disciples a lot.

107
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:23,330
If I were Ding Yunqi,

108
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,780
I would have threatened his disciples,

109
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:27,230
and I would have got the Soul Pursuit Order.

110
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,790
Do you think Ding Yunqi is stupid?

111
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,730
You've been with me for so long.

112
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,530
You only learned how to flatter.

113
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,170
Narrow-minded.

114
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,600
No.

115
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,950
Ding Yunqi cares about the world.

116
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:40,550
He wants to open the Kunlun Mountains.

117
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,270
He wants to open it

118
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,870
in a frank and righteous way.

119
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,260
He doesn't play dirty tricks.

120
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,560
No, this...

121
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:48,650
Young Master,

122
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:50,460
what does this mean?

123
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,570
Ding Yunqi is our deadly foe.

124
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:56,430
Ding Yunqi is our deadly foe,

125
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,010
but it doesn't mean I can't admire him.

126
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,580
Heroes respect heroes.

127
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,640
Anyway, Zhou Qiuhai

128
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,300
won't be able to survive this.

129
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,910
Let's just stay here

130
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,720
and enjoy the show in peace.

131
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,200
OK.

132
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,930
I'll watch the show with you.

133
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:17,380
Young Master,

134
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,480
is the strength alright?

135
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,330
The strength...

136
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:22,920
It hurts a little.

137
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,610
Fish is ready.

138
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:26,790
Here.

139
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,050
Try it.

140
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:30,270
San Jin.

141
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,159
The soup tastes so good today.

142
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,159
What soup is this?

143
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:34,640
Three delicacies' soup.

144
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,840
Young Master, try it.

145
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,700
The fish balls

146
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,420
were made of the fresh fish caught by Chen.

147
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:39,350
Very delicious.

148
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,110
Sit down and eat.

149
00:07:41,909 --> 00:07:43,500
No one can stop me today.

150
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,100
I haven't eaten warm food for a long time.

151
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,570
I have to eat a lot today.

152
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,120
Brother, I saw you

153
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,760
eat quite a lot in the Mountain-moving Town as well.

154
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,810
What?

155
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:51,690
Brother.

156
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,880
I plan to go to the Mound-digging Headquarters tomorrow.

157
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,409
You don't have to go with me.

158
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:04,040
It's inappropriate for you to go to the Mound-digging Headquarters, right?

159
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:04,800
Yunqi.

160
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,400
I don't think it's appropriate

161
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,580
for you to go.

162
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,820
Yunqi,

163
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,380
I understand you're willing to trust Zhou Qiuhai.

164
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,020
But on the Kunlun Mountains,

165
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,820
Zhou Qiuhai is against us.

166
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,700
And he's very stubborn.

167
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:21,640
He may do anything

168
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,150
for the Kunlun Mountains.

169
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:25,160
He may even imprison you

170
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,380
and force you to hand over the Heaven Official's Soul Pursuit Order.

171
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,220
I know.

172
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,820
I understand what you think.

173
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,120
But after all,

174
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,559
we're still in their territory,

175
00:08:32,809 --> 00:08:34,070
and we need their help.

176
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,710
It might backfire

177
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,940
if we just go to them aggressively.

178
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:40,280
Don't worry.

179
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,049
I will be careful.

180
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:42,970
Brother.

181
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:44,570
Okay.

182
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:49,270
I'm still worried.

183
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,210
If we want the Soul Pursuit Order of Mound-digging,

184
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:53,350
we have to

185
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,700
convince Zhou Qiuhai.

186
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,030
Enjoy your meal.

187
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:14,300
I'm not hungry. I'm going back to my room.

188
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:21,740
Enjoy.

189
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,420
Brother.

190
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,560
How can you let Yunqi go alone?

191
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,620
It's so dangerous.

192
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,350
Yunqi has always been a gentleman, open and poised.

193
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,610
Just let him do things

194
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,660
in his own way.

195
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,880
It's okay. Don't worry.

196
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,420
After we finish eating,

197
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,990
let's go check the situation around the Mound-digging Headquarters.

198
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,330
If anything happens

199
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,460
after Yunqi goes in tomorrow,

200
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,560
we can back him up.

201
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,770
Okay, Brother.

202
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,530
I'm relieved to hear that.

203
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,590
I'll get ready now.

204
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,260
Eat first.

205
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:57,840
It's not that urgent.

206
00:09:58,190 --> 00:10:00,320
You're right. Don't waste the dishes.

207
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:29,310
Come in.

208
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,890
Master, Wu Shuang is back.

209
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:36,480
Did you have a good trip?

210
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:38,470
Yes.

211
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,650
Yunqi and Luo Yunsong prepared the map in advance.

212
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,310
We didn't take the wrong path.

213
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,230
They were really well prepared.

214
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,800
Master, how's your injury?

215
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,370
It's alright.

216
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:56,260
The doctor prescribed some medicine.

217
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,210
After taking it,

218
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,860
I should be fine after a few days of rest.

219
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,550
What did the doctor say?

220
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:06,520
The steel needle caused inflammation.

221
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:12,820
My health condition

222
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:15,160
is not as good as before.

223
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,030
I can't

224
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,140
compare to you young people.

225
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,850
Have Yunqi and the others settled down?

226
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:27,520
Senior Jiang has arranged everything.

227
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,380
Yunqi will come on time tomorrow.

228
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,020
Okay.

229
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,040
There are things

230
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,440
that need to be ended.

231
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,560
Given my health condition,

232
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:42,900
if anything happens to me one day,

233
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,110
after I die,

234
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:45,160
how should I explain to

235
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,050
your masters and masters' masters?

236
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,710
Master, nothing will happen.

237
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,750
I know you are thankful for what I have done for you.

238
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,690
Don't worry.

239
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:56,820
When Yunqi comes tomorrow,

240
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,320
I won't give him a hard time.

241
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:02,830
I will only let him shrink back from difficulties.

242
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,150
Shrink back from difficulties...

243
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,140
Master, what are you going to do?

244
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:13,220
I can't tell you about that.

245
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,650
If you tell him,

246
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,750
I'll be out of cards to play.

247
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,010
Master.

248
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,810
In my heart,

249
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,810
Mound-digging and you are always the most important.

250
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,350
Just kidding.

251
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,690
Okay.

252
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,330
Go back early.

253
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,720
Otherwise, they would think

254
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,200
we are conspiring to scheme against them.

255
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:36,220
I don't want to leave.

256
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,260
I want to stay and take care of you.

257
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,800
Go back.

258
00:12:40,350 --> 00:12:41,020
Go back.

259
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,310
Go back.

260
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,100
Fine.

261
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,160
Master, you must finish the medicine.

262
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:58,870
Okay.

263
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:00,130
Go.

264
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:50,070
Yunqi.

265
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,130
Why are you standing here?

266
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,090
I was thinking

267
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,720
you should come back soon.

268
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:56,120
Yunqi.

269
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,710
Take a walk with me.

270
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,310
Okay.

271
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,780
Do you know how I got to Mound-digging Sect?

272
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,380
You never told me about that.

273
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:29,630
I was only a few years old when I first came to Mound-digging Sect.

274
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,890
Seniors told me that

275
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,070
I was very sick and had a high fever.

276
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,940
I don't know how many doctors Master had to ask

277
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,000
and how much medicine he coaxed me to have

278
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,530
before I slowly recovered.

279
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:42,820
But after I recovered,

280
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,420
I didn't remember anything.

281
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:47,110
I didn't know where I came from,

282
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,710
who my parents are,

283
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,250
or who I am.

284
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:53,650
I only remember there was a fire.

285
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:55,750
Wu Shuang.

286
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,370
Actually,

287
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:01,760
it's better to

288
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,040
forget some painful memories.

289
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:07,950
Eat something.

290
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:10,750
Let's go.

291
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:22,300
It took me a long time

292
00:15:23,050 --> 00:15:24,510
to not think about the past

293
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:26,330
and accept the fact.

294
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,510
Master really let me take Mound-digging

295
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:29,860
as my own home.

296
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,890
Seeing you

297
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:35,230
grow up to be so elegant and beautiful,

298
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:37,040
he must be very pleased.

299
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:39,010
What?

300
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,410
You are the only one that think I'm elegant and beautiful.

301
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,460
I'm the famous

302
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,380
great devil

303
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,730
in this town, okay?

304
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,790
Really? Great devil?

305
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,300
Thank you, Zhang.

306
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,100
Miss Wu Shuang, your favorite dumplings.

307
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:54,390
Thank you.

308
00:15:58,840 --> 00:15:59,760
Let me tell you.

309
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,240
There is an old chef

310
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,490
in our town

311
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:04,770
who's so good at making pancakes.

312
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:06,980
I can't have enough every time.

313
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,750
I had a stomachache several times because I ate too much

314
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,410
and I didn't feel well all day.

315
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,360
After that, in order to prevent us from eating secretly,

316
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,200
Master specially made

317
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:15,130
a huge crate to store the pancakes.

318
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,250
What do you mean? He locks them up?

319
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,350
That's not an ordinary lock.

320
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,330
It opens whenever you touch it.

321
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,980
It opens whenever you touch it?

322
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:27,480
Then why lock it?

323
00:16:27,610 --> 00:16:29,370
Your master spoils you.

324
00:16:29,710 --> 00:16:30,670
Are you dumb?

325
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,600
Master was teaching us

326
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,530
where there's gain, there's loss.

327
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:40,780
The lock will open when you touch it,

328
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,270
but once you get the pancake,

329
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:44,980
your hand will be stuck.

330
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,970
You can't pull it out no matter how hard you try.

331
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:48,610
If you want to pull out your hand,

332
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:50,470
you have to put down the pancakes.

333
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,230
This is a good trap.

334
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:55,700
But

335
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,160
he can't guard against me.

336
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,480
I've long seen through it.

337
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:01,790
So every time I went to steal food,

338
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,980
I either coaxed Sister

339
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,530
or Senior to go with me

340
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,300
and let them reach out first.

341
00:17:07,339 --> 00:17:08,670
After they are trapped,

342
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,940
I'll get the pancakes.

343
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:13,050
You were so naughty back then.

344
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,270
That's why Senior

345
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:17,000
still doesn't like me till now.

346
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:22,619
I really envy the old times.

347
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,390
I was so carefree.

348
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,440
Wu Shuang.

349
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:27,240
Just say what you want to say.

350
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,010
Don't keep it to yourself.

351
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,940
You can tell?

352
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,770
Yunqi.

353
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,370
I'm worried about you.

354
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,990
What's there to worry about?

355
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,040
What's wrong?

356
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,810
Did your master tell you something?

357
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,220
I believe in your ability.

358
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,190
But you know what?

359
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,750
Master has devoted his whole life

360
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,060
to Mound-digging and Penta-sect.

361
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,740
Anyone who dares to

362
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,930
get his hands on Mound-digging or Penta-sect

363
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,400
will be his enemy.

364
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:11,640
I understand.

365
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,570
I've put you in a dilemma.

366
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:15,330
No.

367
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,460
I'm not talking about myself.

368
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:19,950
Yunqi.

369
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:21,720
Master told me

370
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:25,510
he wanted you to shrink back from difficulties.

371
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,020
My master is not a bad guy.

372
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,160
He won't hurt you on purpose.

373
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,940
But I'm still worried

374
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,400
that Master will hurt you.

375
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,630
I'm also worried

376
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:38,890
you might hurt Master.

377
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,970
Do you know?

378
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,860
I've been thinking

379
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,060
how nice it would be

380
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,190
if we were birds.

381
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,820
You don't have to look for the Kunlun Mountains.

382
00:18:59,850 --> 00:19:01,780
I don't need to remember anything.

383
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,890
Let's find a high cliff,

384
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:07,040
build a nest and live together.

385
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,180
That would be so great.

386
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,520
But we are not birds after all.

387
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,800
At least not now.

388
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:27,530
Don't worry.

389
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,550
I'll be fine tomorrow.

390
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,620
Nothing will happen in the future.

391
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,130
Your master

392
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,190
will live a long life.

393
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,870
As for me,

394
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,340
I will be fine.

395
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,780
In the future,

396
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,550
we will be carefree birds.

397
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,140
We'll fly together,

398
00:19:47,230 --> 00:19:48,690
and build nests together,

399
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,020
okay?

400
00:19:58,360 --> 00:19:59,280
Okay.

401
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:32,750
Mr. Ding.

402
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,310
Master is waiting for you.

403
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:35,440
Please come with me.

404
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:36,660
Thank you.

405
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,640
[Mound-digging Headquarters]

406
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,180
Everyone.

407
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,390
Master only invited Mr. Ding.

408
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,940
If you don't want to leave,

409
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,100
I can prepare tea and food for you.

410
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,580
Sure.

411
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,740
Is there anything delicious?

412
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,810
Brother.

413
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,820
Wait for me here.

414
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,320
I'm just going to catch up with Uncle Zhou.

415
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:00,470
Let's go.

416
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:01,990
Please.

417
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:06,770
Let's go.

418
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,170
-Master. -Uncle.

419
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,390
You're here.

420
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:38,820
Sit.

421
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,420
Wu Shuang.

422
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,860
Come and listen.

423
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,830
Yes, Master.

424
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,350
I want to talk to Yunqi...

425
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,790
Mr. Ding. You should listen too.

426
00:21:58,940 --> 00:22:00,830
Uncle, just call me Yunqi.

427
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:04,060
Although Penta-sect has been disbanded,

428
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,360
we still need to obey

429
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,580
the seniority rules.

430
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:11,070
The seniority rules exist because

431
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:14,480
Penta-sect exists.

432
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,640
Actually, you also know that

433
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,030
even if Penta-sect wasn't disbanded,

434
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:23,340
for decades,

435
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,680
it has been out in the cold.

436
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,640
You're right.

437
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:33,160
But this is exactly

438
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,570
why I want you to be the next Heaven Official.

439
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:39,460
Yunqi.

440
00:22:40,090 --> 00:22:41,770
Being Heaven Official is your fate,

441
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,230
and your responsibility.

442
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:47,150
All these years,

443
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:49,710
Penta-sect has been scattered.

444
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,120
I couldn't find them back

445
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:53,450
however hard I tried.

446
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,440
But as soon as you came back,

447
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,950
even if you knew nothing,

448
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,280
you've gathered the disciples

449
00:22:58,280 --> 00:22:59,330
from Gold-touching

450
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:00,380
and Mountain-moving

451
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,890
around you.

452
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:04,710
If you add Mound-digging,

453
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,520
there's only one sect left, Mountain-demounting.

454
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,450
If Penta-sect can bind and work together,

455
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:12,100
regaining our glory is just a matter of time.

456
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,610
Uncle,

457
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:16,590
disbanding Penta-sect is my father's last wish.

458
00:23:16,590 --> 00:23:18,990
It's also the Heaven Official Order of the last Heaven Official.

459
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:20,050
I won't disobey it.

460
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:22,850
You won't either, right?

461
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:26,970
What I hear may be false. I dare not agree.

462
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,490
But you are standing in front of me alive.

463
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:33,480
If you agree to be the next Heaven Official,

464
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,510
everyone from Mound-digging

465
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,760
will follow your lead.

466
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:38,830
I will also give

467
00:23:39,230 --> 00:23:42,030
the Soul Pursuit Order to you more than willingly.

468
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:45,530
Uncle,

469
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,350
please change the terms.

470
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:49,950
You're still unwilling?

471
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,710
Alright, alright. Forget about it.

472
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:59,260
I will stop talking.

473
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,130
Even I'm tired of myself if I keep rambling on.

474
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,270
Many people in Mound-digging

475
00:24:06,190 --> 00:24:07,490
have been saved by you.

476
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,130
If it were just me,

477
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:11,610
I would

478
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,960
give you the Soul Pursuit Order.

479
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,890
But

480
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:17,340
Mound-digging is not a sect

481
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,300
that doesn't know gratitude.

482
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,370
How about this?

483
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:25,810
I'll give you another chance.

484
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,540
Thank you, uncle.

485
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,420
Don't thank me so early.

486
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:33,910
This may not be a good chance.

487
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,380
There's an underground palace

488
00:24:39,790 --> 00:24:42,050
under the Mound-digging Headquarters.

489
00:24:42,310 --> 00:24:43,910
I've put the Soul Pursuit Order

490
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:45,440
in the underground palace.

491
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:49,550
But the underground palace

492
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,040
is the top secret of Mound-digging.

493
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,090
There are many traps inside

494
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:57,220
that I haven't figured out.

495
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:02,010
If you can get the Soul Pursuit Order in the underground palace,

496
00:25:02,010 --> 00:25:03,440
that's your ability.

497
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:06,380
Our Mound-digging Sect

498
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,300
won't give you a hard time.

499
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:09,900
But if you can't,

500
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,160
then I'm sorry.

501
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,710
Since you've seen the secrets of Mound-digging,

502
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,680
I can't let you go.

503
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,620
I have to lock you up in Mound-digging Region

504
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,510
for the rest of your life.

505
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,830
Do you agree to this term?

506
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,600
Yes. Thank you, uncle.

507
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,850
Don't say yes so soon.

508
00:25:40,310 --> 00:25:41,660
Think about it.

509
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,310
If I can't even solve the puzzle

510
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:47,510
of Mound-digging underground palace,

511
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:48,960
I don't need to think about

512
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,160
opening the Kunlun Mountains anymore.

513
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,310
Courageous.

514
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,670
The entrance to the underground palace

515
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,500
is in the hall.

516
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:07,110
Find it yourself.

517
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,020
Wu Shuang.

518
00:26:17,350 --> 00:26:18,100
Wu Shuang

519
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:19,660
Come out, Wu Shuang.

520
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,770
Let her go.

521
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:35,290
[Observe Heaven and Get Enlightened]

522
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:38,690
Go back.

523
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:39,820
You shouldn't stay.

524
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,820
I'm already here.

525
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,210
I grew up here.

526
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,890
I know Mound-digging better than you do.

527
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,150
I'm sure I can help.

528
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:50,490
Besides,

529
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,750
how can I watch you silly head

530
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:53,520
being locked up?

531
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,090
What are you looking at?

532
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,310
Find the traps.

533
00:26:59,650 --> 00:27:00,400
Stupid.

534
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:05,190
I've been running in this hall for more than ten years.

535
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,210
I didn't find any trap.

536
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,450
Where is it?

537
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:23,000
Your master's chair.

538
00:27:23,130 --> 00:27:25,690
No one dares to touch your master's chair, right?

539
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:26,820
Of course.

540
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,750
Who dares to touch Master's chair?

541
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,350
That would be disobedience.

542
00:27:34,930 --> 00:27:35,990
What are you doing?

543
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:23,100
I've wasted more than ten years here.

544
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,470
It seems

545
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,850
this is our first checkpoint.

546
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,020
This gate

547
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,670
looks like the Mandarin Duck Nine-grid Gate.

548
00:30:43,670 --> 00:30:45,390
But there are no mandarin ducks.

549
00:30:45,390 --> 00:30:46,150
So,

550
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,580
the order of the nine grids on this gate

551
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,930
should be reversed too.

552
00:30:52,110 --> 00:30:52,910
I see.

553
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,210
So,

554
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,520
originally, four and two are the shoulders.

555
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,180
Now it should be eight and six.

556
00:30:58,450 --> 00:30:59,250
That's right.

557
00:31:00,090 --> 00:31:01,730
Originally, eight and six are the feet.

558
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:03,490
Now the feet should be four and two.

559
00:31:03,490 --> 00:31:04,920
Three on the left, seven on the right.

560
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:07,060
Now it's seven on the left and three on the right.

561
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,990
Five should still be in the middle.

562
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,600
Hold this for me.

563
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:52,930
That's right.

564
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:59,380
The gate is not sophisticated enough.

565
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,620
Let's go.

566
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:41,350
Silence speaks better than sounds.

567
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,080
If there's a sound, a person will die.

568
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,730
Peace blows better than winds.

569
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,300
If there's wind, a head will be chopped off.

570
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,000
What's inside?

571
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,830
Why did they put up such scary couplets?

572
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,540
I want to know too.

573
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,160
[Observe Heaven and Get Enlightened]

574
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:19,380
[Observe Heaven and Get Enlightened]

575
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,340
Wu Shuang.

576
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:32,949
Are you alright?

577
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,540
There are small knives in the dust.

578
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,889
Willow catkins.

579
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,840
The willow catkins from your family?

580
00:34:41,130 --> 00:34:41,889
Yes.

581
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,110
How do we solve it?

582
00:34:46,469 --> 00:34:47,469
Give me some time.

583
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:01,290
It seems to be the safest in the middle.

584
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,550
Let's walk over first.

585
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,180
This is an air circulation system.

586
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:32,290
When we came in,

587
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,420
new air came in

588
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,550
and broke the original balance of air.

589
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,920
There should be an air intake on the ground.

590
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,720
This way,

591
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:42,650
the air circulation can be activated and endless.

592
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,470
Are we going to be

593
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:46,730
trapped here forever?

594
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:50,520
This is the checkpoint we need to get through.

595
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,820
Xun is the wind.

596
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:54,100
So the wind is not stopping.

597
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:55,640
Kan is water.

598
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:59,890
Xun on the outside and Kan on the inside means wind and water.

599
00:36:06,730 --> 00:36:08,660
Wu Shuang, use your Jingang Rope.

600
00:36:08,950 --> 00:36:10,510
Change the wind inside the circle

601
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,390
into Kan.

602
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:49,100
Let's go.

603
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:32,310
How long have they been in there?

604
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,800
Two quarters.

605
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,820
Change the tea for me.

606
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:51,890
Yes.

607
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,580
Let's go.

608
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,570
These are the statues of the Penta-sect guardians.

609
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,870
Yunqi.

610
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:15,860
This is the Soul Pursuit Order of Mound-digging.

611
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,150
It can't be.

612
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,410
That's it?

613
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,100
I know this lock.

614
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:28,550
Tell me. I'll solve it.

615
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:40,120
It's not shrinking back from difficulties.

616
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,280
Impossible.

617
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:45,430
Master won't lie to me.

618
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,660
Wu Shuang.

619
00:40:58,870 --> 00:40:59,750
Yunqi.

620
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,890
I'll solve

621
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:04,750
this lock for you.

622
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,170
Oh no.

623
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,380
I have the Soul Pursuit Order now.

624
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:21,260
Take it and leave.

625
00:41:22,010 --> 00:41:23,150
This trap

626
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
can't be solved.

627
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,190
This lock

628
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:31,180
was used to lock the pancakes when I was young.

629
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:33,900
If you want pancakes,

630
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,540
you have to pay.

631
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:38,310
It's the same now.

632
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:42,210
If you want the Soul Pursuit Order,

633
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:45,570
you have to sacrifice.

634
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:55,690
Your master

635
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,790
wants me to choose

636
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,390
between you and the Soul Pursuit Order, right?

637
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:11,910
Master said

638
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:15,220
there are many choices in life.

639
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:18,430
I know it's hard for you to choose.

640
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,480
I've chosen for you.

641
00:42:25,220 --> 00:42:26,750
Take the Soul Pursuit Order

642
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:27,820
and go.
