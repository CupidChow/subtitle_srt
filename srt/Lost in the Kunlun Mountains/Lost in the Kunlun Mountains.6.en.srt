[Episode 6]

4
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:53,070
Young Master!

5
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:54,490
Young Master!

6
00:01:57,190 --> 00:01:58,789
What's wrong, Young Master?

7
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,960
How did it get out?

8
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,280
What got out?

9
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,620
You tell me.

10
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:08,479
How would I know so many things?

11
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,949
What things?

12
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,590
About the brothel?

13
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:14,440
What brothel?

14
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:19,140
About the tomb of the Qing Dynasty,

15
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,250
How did Chu Fengling know

16
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,660
we robbed the tomb of the Qing Dynasty?

17
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,810
I don't know. I didn't tell her, Young Master.

18
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,660
I know it's not you.

19
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:28,130
If you did, I...

20
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:29,980
If you did,

21
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:31,100
I'll put you back into the tomb.

22
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,170
What should we do?

23
00:02:33,470 --> 00:02:34,220
Now you...

24
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:36,450
Now that Chu Fengling knows,

25
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,550
it means more than one person knows about it.

26
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,150
What if...

27
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,880
if my brother hears about this,

28
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:42,329
maybe in a few days,

29
00:02:42,329 --> 00:02:43,530
my brother will know.

30
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,340
Then...

31
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:47,540
What should we do?

32
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,660
What should we do?

33
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,650
I have no choice.

34
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,250
If my brother knows,

35
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,050
we can only say

36
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,220
that

37
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,320
you did this alone.

38
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,340
Me?

39
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,090
Yes.

40
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,240
No.

41
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,630
No, you...

42
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,480
Think about it. Here's the thing.

43
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,820
You are a tomb robber.

44
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:09,000
Right?

45
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,000
You're doing your old job.

46
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:13,070
You're doing your job again, right?

47
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:14,330
It's a serious matter.

48
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,680
I am a serious person.

49
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,200
I'm integral and innocent.

50
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,710
What if it happened to me?

51
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,850
If I did what you did,

52
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,820
I'm abandoning the good and doing evil, right?

53
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,700
No, no.

54
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:26,130
Besides, I...

55
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:27,350
If I get arrested...

56
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,440
I can help you if you get arrested.

57
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,240
Who can help me if I get arrested?

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:31,890
I can't.

59
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,020
Right?

60
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,840
You know what to do?

61
00:03:37,090 --> 00:03:37,930
No.

62
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,500
Who robbed the tomb of the Qing Dynasty?

63
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:43,900
I did it.

64
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,630
Why are you so upset?

65
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:47,510
Be confident.

66
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,140
I...

67
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,160
Lower your voice.

68
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:51,920
I did it.

69
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,050
You did it?

70
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,070
I did it.

71
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,120
How could you do this?

72
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,110
You really...

73
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,710
You really scared me.

74
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:03,720
I have to find a place to beat you up.

75
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:18,550
Where would my brother

76
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:21,360
put the dragon bone?

77
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,970
I didn't bring my ax with me today.

78
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,490
Otherwise I can have more moves.

79
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,240
Again.

80
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,340
No, no, no.

81
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,870
I, Wu Shuang, admit defeat today.

82
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,210
You are Wu Shuang?

83
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,710
No wonder you were so good.

84
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,940
My brother mentioned you several times.

85
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,600
You're really chivalrous and beautiful.

86
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,450
I just made a pot of tea.

87
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,920
Let's go downstairs and have some tea.

88
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,360
Sorry, Ms. Chu.

89
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:30,870
I came uninvited today

90
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,200
and went into your room.

91
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,380
I'm really sorry.

92
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,290
To be honest, I did

93
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,670
a similar thing.

94
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,290
We don't need to look down on each other.

95
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,900
Sorry for what happened today.

96
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,159
I'll take my leave.

97
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,840
Wu Shuang.

98
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,870
I just want to treat you a cup of tea.

99
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,400
I don't mean anything else.

100
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:57,870
For the sake

101
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,600
I saved Ding Yunqi,

102
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,310
please stay with me.

103
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:03,460
OK?

104
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:23,620
I feel much better after a sleep.

105
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,420
Young Master.

106
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,030
Where is Wu Shuang?

107
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,450
She went out for a while

108
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,060
I don't know where she went.

109
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,270
Oh no.

110
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,380
I know you're here for the dragon bone.

111
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,450
How did you know?

112
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,280
I don't have the dragon bone. I'm also looking for it.

113
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,170
You're looking for the dragon bone too?

114
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:48,420
My lady, Mr. Ding Yunqi is at the door

115
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,280
asking if Ms. Wu Shuang is here.

116
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,690
Yes, let Mr. Ding in.

117
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,120
Yes, my lady.

118
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,690
It seems that Ding Yunqi didn't send you here.

119
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,190
I...

120
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:00,740
I'd better leave.

121
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,680
Where are you going?

122
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:04,300
I...

123
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,020
Yes, where else can I go?

124
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,830
How did you sneak into our mansion

125
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,180
in broad daylight?

126
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:14,770
It's simple.

127
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,200
I just walked around

128
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,630
and found a place with nobody,

129
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,510
so I came in.

130
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,440
How did you know that was my room?

131
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,040
I went around and

132
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:24,850
I smelled a special fragrance.

133
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,370
I guessed it was your room.

134
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,630
Is this the smell?

135
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,570
Yes.

136
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:32,880
This is it.

137
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,840
It smells good.

138
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,230
It smells good, right?

139
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,740
This is western perfume.

140
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,550
It means the same as the sachet

141
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:39,600
of Chinese girls'.

142
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,650
I have a sachet.

143
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,159
Auntie Hei, prepare one for Wu Shuang.

144
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,520
OK.

145
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,650
No, no, no.

146
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:47,870
No need.

147
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,100
It's not a rare thing.

148
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,920
I'm here to steal the dragon bone.

149
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,420
You even gave me a gift.

150
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,100
It doesn't make sense.

151
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,940
No matter why you are here,

152
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,960
I really like this situation.

153
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,350
Mr. Ding, please.

154
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:13,910
Ms. Chu.

155
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,760
I'm here to pick up Wu Shuang.

156
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,720
Sit down and have some tea.

157
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:19,120
No, thanks.

158
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:23,250
Tomorrow's appointment. Are you coming or not?

159
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:24,880
Yes.

160
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:27,980
My lady.

161
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,030
Take it.

162
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,580
Yunqi!

163
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,780
Yunqi.

164
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:01,490
You're getting bolder.

165
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,290
Look.

166
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,000
Chu Fengling gave it to me.

167
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,630
So you two are friends now?

168
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,240
Sort of.

169
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,230
I didn't get the dragon bone.

170
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:18,210
Why are you so happy after getting a bottle of perfume?

171
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,070
Let me tell you.

172
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,400
I searched her room but couldn't find it.

173
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,910
And the Auntie Hei beside her

174
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:23,960
is very powerful.

175
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,390
I couldn't beat her.

176
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,830
You couldn't beat her?

177
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,370
It seems

178
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,080
it's not easy to get the dragon bone.

179
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,710
Maybe

180
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:42,410
Chu Fengling can help us.

181
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,380
Did she say that?

182
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,850
No, I guess.

183
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,470
Stop guessing.

184
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,370
Why?

185
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,850
I always think she's weird.

186
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,340
I don't know what she's thinking.

187
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,140
She's making me uncomfortable.

188
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:00,750
Brother.

189
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,020
Are you coming back for dinner tonight?

190
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:03,740
No.

191
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,260
Not necessarily.

192
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:07,560
What? Do you have plans?

193
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,870
I invited Ding Yunqi to meet me in the hospital this morning.

194
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,630
I plan to invite him over for dinner tonight.

195
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:12,680
Ding Yunqi?

196
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,790
Let's talk while eating.

197
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,970
Our Chinese habits, right?

198
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,540
Sister, there's an old saying in China.

199
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,770
It's called bringing a wolf into the house. Have you heard of it?

200
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,990
Ask him to come to our house.

201
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,460
Did you ask brother?

202
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:32,590
Did you ask me?

203
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:34,310
Did brother agree? Did I?

204
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,120
She didn't ask me.

205
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,630
I didn't agree either.

206
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,110
He came yesterday.

207
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,390
Wu Shuang came too.

208
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:50,480
Brother, I think

209
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,670
we must make friends with Ding Yunqi.

210
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,510
We can't keep this up.

211
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,470
Ding Yunqi is stubborn.

212
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,040
We can't confront him head-on.

213
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,300
We need wisdom.

214
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,020
So you didn't discuss with me

215
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:02,350
before you used wisdom?

216
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,170
Brother.

217
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:04,970
What brother?

218
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,510
You're being ridiculous.

219
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:08,120
Just let me do it once.

220
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,140
What are you talking about?

221
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,180
Talking about cooperation.

222
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,180
Unlike you,

223
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,050
I welcome everyone to join.

224
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,340
But don't make trouble.

225
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,950
Okay.

226
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:25,760
You're a special member now, right?

227
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,940
You have Her Ladyship to support you.

228
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,990
As your brother, it's useless to say anything.

229
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,630
You can do whatever you want.

230
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:32,940
It's a deal.

231
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,170
Ding Yunqi will come for dinner tonight.

232
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:36,230
I'll talk with him.

233
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,560
You have to talk too. You have to be there.

234
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,450
I will.

235
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,770
Well...

236
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,450
Me?

237
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,010
You'll be here too.

238
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,090
Okay.

239
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,310
But remember, Jiutian.

240
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:56,710
Don't make trouble for Fengling.

241
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:58,310
Don't fight with Ding Yunqi.

242
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:00,490
I'm too old to fight.

243
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,170
Besides, I can't beat him.

244
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:48,080
You look the same.

245
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,790
Two dress up as students

246
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,950
and two will be poor women.

247
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,670
The other four keep it.

248
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,480
Do you hear me?

249
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,620
Yes.

250
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,760
Mr. Ding, you're here.

251
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,470
My lady said

252
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,820
you can come in directly.

253
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:14,020
No need to inform her.

254
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:14,920
Please.

255
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:24,910
Ding Yunqi.

256
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,630
Are you here alone?

257
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,500
I'm so disappointed.

258
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,160
Has your wound healed?

259
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:43,560
No. It's a big bruise.

260
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,760
I dressed up for nothing.

261
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,970
I'm here to visit you.

262
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,000
If you want to fight, another day.

263
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:53,970
I didn't want to beat you.

264
00:13:53,970 --> 00:13:54,860
Now that you said that,

265
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,520
I think you deserve a beating.

266
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,590
Can you beat me?

267
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:00,110
I can't.

268
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:01,950
What era is it now?

269
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,280
Why do you always fight?

270
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,480
Don't think about beating someone.

271
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,560
Besides,

272
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,670
you may not be...

273
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,050
Our hands are...

274
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,740
We are so close.

275
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,720
My hands are faster than your gun.

276
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,880
Let's eat.

277
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,690
My house is big. Follow me and don't get lost.

278
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:37,360
Would you sneak up on me

279
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,280
and kick me?

280
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,840
That's your habit.

281
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,190
I dressed up like this for nothing.

282
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,910
Really.

283
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:55,650
Wu Shuang isn't here.

284
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:04,910
He's here.

285
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,340
I brought him in.

286
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:10,500
Ms. Chu.

287
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:11,670
Director Luo.

288
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:14,780
Yunqi.

289
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,260
Come, sit down and talk.

290
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:22,760
Yunqi.

291
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,110
Take a look at this.

292
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:30,910
[Certificate of Appointment, Chu Fengling, a special member of the Secret Investigation Team of the Kunlun Mountains]

293
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,250
I invited you to the hospital this morning

294
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,480
because I hope you can understand me more.

295
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,140
Before this mission arrives,

296
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,770
I've been with Her Ladyship

297
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,850
doing work for women and charity.

298
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:46,910
After that, my focus of work

299
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,020
will be transferred to the Kunlun Mountains.

300
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,210
Yunqi, to be honest,

301
00:15:51,990 --> 00:15:53,590
I hope we can work together.

302
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:58,750
Let's not talk about cooperation.

303
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:03,470
Let's talk about the dragon bone first.

304
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,610
Yunqi, why don't we sit down

305
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,080
and talk while eating?

306
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,170
Okay.

307
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,220
Here, this room.

308
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,640
Aiwu, come with me.

309
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,950
The rest of you stay here.

310
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:44,450
Okay.

311
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,460
Where are you going?

312
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,420
I'm going in to explore.

313
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:47,640
Brother, I'll go too.

314
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,820
You'd better shiver here.

315
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,000
It's very dangerous inside.

316
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,470
What's there to be afraid of?

317
00:16:52,470 --> 00:16:53,980
Our Young Master is not afraid. Neither am I.

318
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,070
Good for you.

319
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,470
You have some guts.

320
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,510
Let's go.

321
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:59,440
Don't make any trouble now.

322
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,330
Let's wait for him here.

323
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:03,390
Luo Yunsong is vicious.

324
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:05,000
Will he show mercy to Yunqi?

325
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:09,490
Let's wait and see.

326
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:42,750
Yunqi, come.

327
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,140
I promise you.

328
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,070
If we can cooperate,

329
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,290
I'll return the dragon bone to you.

330
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,700
Is this the condition?

331
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,790
No.

332
00:18:00,090 --> 00:18:01,260
How should I put it?

333
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:03,880
This is a necessary procedure.

334
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:05,670
If we can cooperate,

335
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,730
not only the dragon bone can be returned to you,

336
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,370
but your father's arrest warrant

337
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:10,370
can be withdrawn.

338
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:21,840
Yunqi.

339
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,720
Eat.

340
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:24,260
Try our cook's cooking.

341
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:29,150
Mr. Ding.

342
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:30,580
Welcome.

343
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,030
Brother.

344
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,710
Yunqi doesn't drink. I forgot to tell you.

345
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,910
Let me do it.

346
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,510
Cheers.

347
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:03,630
Yunqi.

348
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,940
What do you think?

349
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,030
Just tell me.

350
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,470
This is my first time talking about this.

351
00:19:09,470 --> 00:19:10,980
I don't know what to do.

352
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:13,710
If there is anything wrong,

353
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:14,510
don't mind.

354
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,210
I don't think it's the right time

355
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:19,840
to talk about this,

356
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,510
because we still have bad impression

357
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,060
of each other.

358
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,840
Even if we don't mention the past,

359
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,300
we can never forget.

360
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,000
I'm still in danger.

361
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,390
I can't trust you.

362
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,650
Secondly,

363
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,130
I know no more about the Kunlun Mountains than you do.

364
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,240
You know I'm just a doctor.

365
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,970
I'm not from Penta-sect.

366
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,340
But I heard that

367
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,950
only two people can open up the Kunlun Mountains.

368
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:50,590
Your father and you.

369
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,930
Only one person.

370
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:53,110
It's my father.

371
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,960
Didn't your father teach you?

372
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:58,940
No.

373
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,720
He will teach me only if I join Penta-sect.

374
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,120
But I haven't joined yet.

375
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:07,180
I have one last reason.

376
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,700
The Kunlun Mountains belong to Penta-sect

377
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,800
not us Ding family.

378
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,270
Even if my father is sitting here today,

379
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:15,660
he may not agree.

380
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:23,470
So, this matter

381
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,860
is much more complicated than I thought.

382
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,550
So I must get the dragon bone

383
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,800
and find my father

384
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,350
before things can go on.

385
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,710
I see.

386
00:20:34,980 --> 00:20:36,380
I have another question.

387
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:37,540
Tell me.

388
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:40,940
Why are you doing this?

389
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:43,380
For the country.

390
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:53,030
I studied abroad for five years.

391
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:55,590
I insisted on coming back regardless of my teacher's persuasion.

392
00:20:55,590 --> 00:20:57,780
On one hand, my brothers are here.

393
00:20:58,880 --> 00:20:59,930
On the other hand,

394
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,570
I want to contribute to our country.

395
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:06,180
We've been fighting battles for years. We're waiting to be prospered.

396
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,180
Our country needs

397
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,620
ambitious youths like us

398
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:09,920
to build it.

399
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,070
Aren't you, Yunqi?

400
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:14,690
Don't you want

401
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,600
our people to live a good life?

402
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,700
No more poverty and war.

403
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,720
What's in the Kunlun Mountains?

404
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,650
I don't know.

405
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:25,080
What if it's a huge fortune?

406
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:27,350
It will be a great contribution

407
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:28,740
to our government.

408
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,540
For the people,

409
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,200
it will be a good chance to change their lives.

410
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,040
I only know

411
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,390
if the country and the people are rich,

412
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,570
there won't be so many orphans in the hospital.

413
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:42,220
And there won't be so much suffering in the people.

414
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:42,930
So,

415
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,830
no matter what's inside the Kunlun Mountains,

416
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:48,520
no matter how difficult it is to open up the Kunlun Mountains,

417
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,320
I will try my best to keep going.

418
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,040
You don't believe me?

419
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:03,370
I do.

420
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,050
But in my understanding,

421
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,940
patriotism is not a deal.

422
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,650
You trade the dragon bone for my father's freedom.

423
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:13,200
Do you think I'll agree?

424
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,230
Don't worry, Yunqi.

425
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:17,880
Give me more time.

426
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,080
Director Luo.

427
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,460
What do you think?

428
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:27,830
I support her.

429
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,340
I'll give my full support.

430
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,830
My sister is a special member of the Investigation Team of the Kunlun Mountains.

431
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,890
I'll listen to her.

432
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,100
I support her.

433
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,100
In that case,

434
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:47,570
I understand.

435
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:03,700
He's out.

436
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,220
Unfortunately, Yunqi.

437
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:08,280
I couldn't return the dragon bone to you today.

438
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,200
But your luggage

439
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,460
can be returned to you.

440
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:13,040
Should I say thank you?

441
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,430
I'm glad you understand my sincerity.

442
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,830
The rest doesn't matter.

443
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,090
Bye.

444
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:22,720
Bye.

445
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,870
I have a gift for you.

446
00:23:38,140 --> 00:23:38,930
How was it?

447
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,700
Have you got the dragon bone?

448
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,580
Only the box.

449
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,300
What's going on?

450
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:45,850
It's a bit complicated.

451
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:47,290
OK, Aiwu.

452
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:48,310
Take our men to leave.

453
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,390
-Yes, brother. -Everything's fine.

454
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:50,190
Let's go.

455
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:53,380
Let's go back first.

456
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:56,700
Let's go.

457
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,300
We had a very serious meal today.

458
00:24:09,970 --> 00:24:13,500
I was afraid that my brother would suddenly shout to arrest him.

459
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,860
It's not easy for Master

460
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:18,530
to make such a concession.

461
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,060
I'm satisfied as long as it can be like today.

462
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,940
No fight. Peaceful coexistence.

463
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:28,000
I don't want anything to happen to my brother.

464
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,820
Ding Yunqi is educated and reasonable.

465
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,540
He has good manners

466
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:33,950
and is reasonable.

467
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:39,970
Unfortunately,

468
00:24:40,170 --> 00:24:41,900
I couldn't persuade him today.

469
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,230
I'll keep working hard.

470
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:46,190
I'll persuade him no matter what.

471
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:00,790
Brother.

472
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:04,230
Do you think Fengling was telling the truth?

473
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:06,040
I hope it's not true.

474
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,720
If we have

475
00:25:07,850 --> 00:25:10,910
a passionate youth in our family, I'll have a headache.

476
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,840
A man like me

477
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:14,820
can't be a passionate young man.

478
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,040
I'm so indifferent.

479
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,400
I mean

480
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:22,780
do you think it's true about the Kunlun Mountains?

481
00:25:23,090 --> 00:25:24,090
Do you believe it?

482
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,070
Of course.

483
00:25:25,530 --> 00:25:26,490
Of course I do.

484
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,930
When I was young, I read books and stories.

485
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:30,740
Right? There are so many treasures inside.

486
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,040
Where are they?

487
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,470
Well,

488
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:35,400
the jade belt,

489
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,570
golden sword...

490
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,540
Don't laugh.

491
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:41,320
Let me tell you.

492
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:43,000
When I read Journey to the West,

493
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,810
It wrote

494
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:46,740
the Purple Golden Gourd

495
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:47,960
and the Palm-leaf Fan

496
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,260
are both from the Kunlun Mountains.

497
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,100
Do you know that?

498
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:50,850
You...

499
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,820
Think about it.

500
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,470
Where are the treasures now?

501
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,770
They must be in the Kunlun Mountains.

502
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:56,940
Isn't it all right?

503
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,290
There is more wealth in it than in a country.

504
00:25:59,290 --> 00:26:00,680
In several countries.

505
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,400
I think what Fengling said is quite true.

506
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,410
I'd rather believe it

507
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,420
than disbelieve it.

508
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:14,250
You're all crazy.

509
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,140
You don't drink anymore?

510
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:23,110
It's a waste.

511
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,410
Chu Fengling is opening up the tomb of the Kunlun Mountains.

512
00:26:40,410 --> 00:26:41,170
What?

513
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,520
Someone is following us.

514
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,200
Yunqi, leave first.

515
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,140
I'll stay and deal with them.

516
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,930
Brother, don't go too far.

517
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:50,590
Okay, I'll listen to you.

518
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,700
Let's split up.

519
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:56,740
Yes, let's go separately.

520
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,760
San Jin, come with me.

521
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,640
No need, Young Master.

522
00:26:58,640 --> 00:26:59,900
I'm just a burden to you.

523
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:00,800
This is not a fight.

524
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,830
I'm good at running away.

525
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:02,760
Fine, Yunqi.

526
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,340
Just let him go by himself.

527
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,820
You've grown up.

528
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:07,860
Young Master, I'm leaving.

529
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,350
Yunqi, I'm leaving too.

530
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,040
Be careful.

531
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,790
Be careful.

532
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,190
I'm going back to master.

533
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,440
Be careful.

534
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,610
Don't worry.

535
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:05,520
You are my father's friend.

536
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,550
Trace me?

537
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,870
It's not done yet.

538
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:40,700
Look.

539
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:42,880
San Jin. You're good.

540
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,760
You were brave last night.

541
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,930
I was with you every day.

542
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,400
I couldn't be coward.

543
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:48,940
Of course.

544
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,140
I finally understand

545
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,670
martial artists community

546
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:52,770
is just like that.

547
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:55,030
There's nothing to be afraid of.

548
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:57,390
Sure.

549
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,660
There are also slingbows abroad.

550
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,160
This is a stethoscope.

551
00:30:05,490 --> 00:30:06,350
Don't break it.

552
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:07,880
It's for treatment.

553
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:09,650
Let me see.

554
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,580
Stethoscope.

555
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:12,630
Let me see.

556
00:30:14,290 --> 00:30:15,240
Slingbow.

557
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,100
Let me play.

558
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:24,900
Brother.

559
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:26,530
Just cook.

560
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,340
This is good.

561
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,020
What is this?

562
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,460
A radio?

563
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,690
This is a camera.

564
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,790
Camera?

565
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:49,950
Take a picture for me.

566
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,910
The light is not good. I'll take it for you tomorrow.

567
00:30:52,910 --> 00:30:54,300
The light matters?

568
00:31:08,490 --> 00:31:09,370
Yunqi.

569
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,970
I won't leave tonight.

570
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,100
I'll eat here.

571
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,080
Brother, I knew it.

572
00:31:14,290 --> 00:31:16,220
You came back for late night snack.

573
00:31:16,550 --> 00:31:17,940
I made 20 more buns

574
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,940
and made a big pot of porridge.

575
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,760
20 buns are not enough.

576
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,070
Yunqi, Yunqi must be hungry.

577
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,210
And Wu Shuang.

578
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:27,010
You know how much she eats.

579
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:30,220
There are only so many ingredients now.

580
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,490
Just make do with it.

581
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:35,080
Director, I've checked the address.

582
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,320
No wonder he's so confident.

583
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,100
This place is quite troublesome.

584
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,890
The French Concession.

585
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:47,260
Ding Yunqi's lair?

586
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:48,310
Yes.

587
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,660
Jiutian.

588
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,450
Keep an eye in the car tomorrow.

589
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,780
Let's see who's there. How many are there?

590
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,110
If there are new faces, keep an eye on them.

591
00:32:00,110 --> 00:32:01,660
After we know the situation,

592
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,920
Biao will take action.

593
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:05,480
Don't worry. I know that place.

594
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,020
Don't tell Fengling.

595
00:32:07,210 --> 00:32:08,010
I understand.

596
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:09,680
It's between men.

597
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,410
We'll use the Black Feather Team for the arrest tomorrow.

598
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:13,510
The quieter the better.

599
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:14,180
Yes.

600
00:32:17,710 --> 00:32:18,460
Come here.

601
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:21,690
Do you understand the mission?

602
00:32:21,690 --> 00:32:22,790
We'll use the Black Feather Team for the arrest tomorrow.

603
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:23,880
The quieter the better.

604
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,880
We think the same.

605
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:26,380
I just want to remind you

606
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:27,900
sometimes

607
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,420
you...you...

608
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:31,980
What?

609
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,920
Where are you going? I haven't finished.

610
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,990
Why did you get it again?

611
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:41,730
Ding Yunqi is such a bully.

612
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,030
He wants to disgust me.

613
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,160
You think there are few people who know it?

614
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,990
When I catch you,

615
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,620
I'll let you chew the bullets

616
00:32:49,830 --> 00:32:51,640
one by one!

617
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,830
You're bullying me!

618
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,780
Young Master.

619
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:10,830
Well...

620
00:33:11,670 --> 00:33:12,600
The goods we got

621
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,470
from the tomb of the Qing Dynasty

622
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:18,080
were bid low by the buyers.

623
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:21,290
But we have to get them out.

624
00:33:22,510 --> 00:33:24,860
Although we stole a tomb of the Qing Dynasty,

625
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:27,190
we'll be beheaded if others know about it.

626
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:29,730
Besides, we don't have much money.

627
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,260
Let's get them sold quickly to avoid trouble.

628
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:33,390
OK.

629
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:34,770
Thank you, boss.

630
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,090
[Fruit stall. Zhu's Wonton.]

631
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:36,120
Take care.

632
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,320
Young Master.

633
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,740
That woman...

634
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:43,590
Which woman?

635
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,950
Hurry. Where are my clothes?

636
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,910
The chain is hung up.

637
00:33:53,710 --> 00:33:54,510
Young Master.

638
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:55,600
Young Master, don't.

639
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,460
Don't go there.

640
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,590
-The director told us to keep an eye on Ding Yunqi -Let's go.

641
00:33:58,590 --> 00:33:59,720
Don't, Young Master.

642
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:01,020
Don't go over there.

643
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,660
Beauty.

644
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:07,700
Pretty.

645
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,310
Where did you jump out from?

646
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,219
Jump out?

647
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:11,770
You make me sound like a toad.

648
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,659
Aren't you?

649
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:15,469
Aren't you at

650
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:16,730
Taiyi Private Bank?

651
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,580
Why did you come out?

652
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:20,130
None of your business.

653
00:34:20,469 --> 00:34:21,929
You're here to buy fruits.

654
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,210
Let's go. I'll take you to have tea.

655
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,469
Do you want some cakes?

656
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:26,940
Or some foreign slices?

657
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,230
Stay away from me. You're annoying.

658
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,260
How come I'm annoying?

659
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,530
I formally proposed to you.

660
00:34:34,290 --> 00:34:34,710
You are my...

661
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,590
Say that again.

662
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,159
You are my wife.

663
00:34:38,230 --> 00:34:38,780
Fine.

664
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,719
Alright, I will say it in my heart.

665
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:43,190
Say it in my heart.

666
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,420
I'm just kidding.

667
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,469
Annoying.

668
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:51,170
Listen, don't be like this to me.

669
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,389
You don't even know who I am.

670
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,120
Do you understand?

671
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,080
I can give you

672
00:34:56,630 --> 00:34:57,890
what Ding Yunqi

673
00:34:58,310 --> 00:34:59,860
can give you, too.

674
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:01,670
What he can't give,

675
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,140
I can give you still.

676
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,150
Do you know why?

677
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,720
Because I

678
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:12,550
like you.

679
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:15,820
You rogue.

680
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:17,670
Give me some face in front of others.

681
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,200
You kicked me on the street.

682
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,900
Go home and kick me.

683
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,250
Say it again!

684
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:26,940
Give me the dragon bone.

685
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:29,600
No problem.

686
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,030
No problem.

687
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,410
Liar.

688
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,430
You don't even know where the dragon bone is.

689
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:35,390
Why don't I know?

690
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,650
I...

691
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,910
I had dinner at home

692
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,960
with my brother and sister.

693
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,760
My brother was drunk.

694
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:40,940
I induced him to tell the truth.

695
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,200
He told me everything.

696
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:43,730
What did he say?

697
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:45,520
He said where he hid the dragon bone.

698
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,650
In our mansion.

699
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:48,410
Where?

700
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,720
Why would I lie to you?

701
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:50,810
He's hiding in a...

702
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:51,820
How should I put it?

703
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,160
Anyway, it's the corner.

704
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,670
You don't know even if I tell you.

705
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:55,390
My home is so big.

706
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,850
Why don't you come with me?

707
00:35:56,910 --> 00:35:57,640
I can give you

708
00:35:57,650 --> 00:35:59,250
the dragon bone, right?

709
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,790
I drove here. Get in.

710
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,550
Have you ever taken a big car?

711
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:09,370
Let me tell you.

712
00:36:09,830 --> 00:36:12,270
If you dare lie to me, I...

713
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,260
If I lie to you,

714
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:19,510
I'll let you beat me for the rest of my life.

715
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:20,540
Let's go. Come on.

716
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,310
Come on. Start up the engine. Hurry.

717
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:23,310
Shameless!

718
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,910
Come on, girl.

719
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,880
Beauty.

720
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,740
Please.

721
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:32,870
Let me wipe it for you.

722
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:35,870
Sit with me.

723
00:36:38,390 --> 00:36:39,450
Hurry up. Let's go.

724
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:42,460
Stay away from me.

725
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:43,810
I won't be next to you.

726
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:50,570
[Wealth Grain Shop]

727
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,860
Okay.

728
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:16,190
Here we are.

729
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,670
Let's see how big my house is.

730
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,640
Does it look like the one in the movie?

731
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,400
This way.

732
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:25,950
Do you feel dizzy after taking a car for the first time?

733
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,400
I'll buy you one later.

734
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:32,700
Here, have some.

735
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:34,710
Have a taste.

736
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:38,280
I don't know what you like.

737
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:40,300
So I asked my cook

738
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,730
to prepare every kind.

739
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,200
Get me the dragon bone.

740
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,670
I'll leave after that.

741
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:45,760
Yes.

742
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,860
Have some soda.

743
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,340
My brother

744
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:52,020
needs tools.

745
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,400
That's a trap.

746
00:37:53,930 --> 00:37:54,280
Well,

747
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:55,790
have some soda first.

748
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,290
It's really good.

749
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,140
It's fun. It's bubbly inside.

750
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:00,630
Eat and drink.

751
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,840
What the hell is this?

752
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,040
Yes.

753
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,250
That...

754
00:38:06,770 --> 00:38:08,210
that foreign drink.

755
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:11,620
I usually don't want to drink it.

756
00:38:12,050 --> 00:38:13,770
My little sister loves this.

757
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,470
Fengling drinks this.

758
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,000
She likes it.

759
00:38:19,190 --> 00:38:20,030
She drinks several bottles a day.

760
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:21,250
She won't sleep without drinking it.

761
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:22,130
This is from

762
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,010
abroad.

763
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,030
It tastes good.

764
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:26,370
It's bubbly. Try it.

765
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,800
Try it.

766
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,290
Why does it taste so weird?

767
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,680
It's even popping in my mouth.

768
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,020
Yes.

769
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,660
This...

770
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:53,960
This is called soda.

771
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:56,270
Foreigners do this, right?

772
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,040
It will pop in your mouth.

773
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Isn't it strange?

774
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:00,180
Drink more.

775
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,060
Have another sip.

776
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:02,280
It's okay. Don't be shy.

777
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:03,810
I'm happy that you drink it.

778
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:15,590
Isn't it fun?

779
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:20,760
Get me the dragon bone.

780
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,990
Yes, you...

781
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,500
Drink more.

782
00:39:25,590 --> 00:39:26,300
Drink.

783
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,130
I'll get it after you finish it.

784
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,500
Wu Shuang.

785
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:47,770
What's wrong, Shuang?

786
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,150
Wu Shuang.

787
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:53,230
What happened?

788
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,860
Young Master.

789
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:58,050
I think you put too much medicine. It's a bit strong.

790
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,050
What are you waiting for?

791
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:04,820
Tie her up. Hurry.

792
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:07,810
Are you okay?

793
00:40:15,900 --> 00:40:17,080
I'm sorry then.

794
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:27,190
What's wrong? You look like you've lost your soul.

795
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:29,340
Young Master's car just came back.

796
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:31,110
There was a person in the car.

797
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,560
It's Ms. Wu Shuang who came here last time.

798
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:37,280
Wu Shuang? Are you sure?

799
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,540
Yes.

800
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,730
She's so beautiful

801
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,480
that I'll never forget her look.
