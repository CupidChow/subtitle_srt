It seems to be Heavenly Thunder without Delusion.

60

You went to Sect Leader Hao and took the Soul Pursuit Order by deception,

61
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:23,350
and then you pretended to be nice to us.

Yunqi.

68
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,220
Don't let him fool you.

69
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:35,240
He came to Tianjin with us cryptically.

70
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,200
There must be something wrong.

71
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,130
That Soul Pursuit Order

72
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,100
is a blood oath to him.

73
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,650
Without the Soul Pursuit Order,

74
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:43,170
he can't talk to us about the alliance.

75
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:46,530
I wasn't thoughtful enough.

76
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,840
Now it seems

77
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,310
no one is that simple.

78
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,640
Who else could it be?

79
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,450
Yunqi is right.

82

has always been carefree,

83
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,090
playing dumb.

84
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:06,360
He must have

85
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:08,370
prepared a lot

86
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,770
and learned about Penta-sect.

87
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,790
Also, Zhou Qiuhai

88
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,300
is also very suspicious.

89
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,940
He must know

90
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,660
what we know.

91
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,390
Besides,

92
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,520
my arranging accommodation for Lord Hao

93
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,080
should have been in his sight for a while.

94
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,680
If that's the case,

95
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:29,160
he should already have two Soul Pursuit Orders.

96
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,310
Then he's got more capital to fight against you.

97
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,770
Do you think what you said

98
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,900
hasn't been considered by Yunqi?

99
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:39,960
But you couldn't say it.

100
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,700
Yunqi.

101
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,000
I've told you.

102
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,310
I'll get the Soul Pursuit Order back for you.

103
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,780
I will do it.

104
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,420
I'll definitely keep looking for

105
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,890
the Kunlun Mountains.

106
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,360
Do you want one more helper

107
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,659
or one more enemy?

108
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,230
It's up to you.

109
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,710
Are you threatening us?

110
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,370
I'm just being frank.

111
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,570
I don't have to tell you.

112
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:11,500
You don't understand.

113
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,670
As long as Yunqi understands me.

114
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:13,930
Do you?

115
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,060
Go back to Shanghai.

116
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,070
Together?

117
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,900
You can't drink this...

118
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,080
Yunqi.

119
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,580
Take my car back.

120
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,430
Your car is a bit crowded.

121
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,159
Sure.

122
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:54,090
When did Luo Yunsong go to Tianjin?

123
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,990
If Yunqi arranged this, then...

124
00:07:58,580 --> 00:07:59,920
Then that's bad.

125
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,320
Our men from the Tianjin Branch

126
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,410
said in the telegram that

127
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,220
they were already together in Tianjin.

128
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,900
But it's not known if they went there together.

129
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:10,840
And then?

130
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,330
Luo Yunsong took Yunqi to Lord Hao.

131
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:23,270
Have you got the Soul Pursuit Order for mountain-demounting?

132
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:24,900
I'm not sure.

133
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,090
But

134
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:28,400
Lord Hao and his disciple

135
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,530
were poisoned to death.

136
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:32,929
Dead?

137
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,400
That's not right.

138
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:47,130
Based on Yunqi's personality,

139
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,890
he wouldn't have killed anyone.

140
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,600
I guess the Soul Pursuit Order

141
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,110
has already fallen into someone else's hands.

142
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,260
Who could it be?

143
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:00,860
Look.

144
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:04,980
Our men from the Tianjin Branch received a mission

145
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:06,530
to go find Lord Hao.

146
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,090
After they found it,

147
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:11,490
it's said Lord Hao moved away years ago.

148
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:14,140
Also, Luo Yunsong

149
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,110
found Lord Hao

150
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:17,330
in such a short time.

151
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,890
Do you think it's possible?

152
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:28,040
No benefit, no getting up early.

153
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,050
I think Luo Yunsong

154
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:32,150
was acting out a play for Ding Yunqi.

155
00:09:33,450 --> 00:09:34,550
You mean

156
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,570
Luo Yunsong got the Soul Pursuit Order first,

157
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,750
and then played up to Yunqi.

158
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,370
Luo Yunsong

159
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:50,840
is getting more and more interesting.

160
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,020
Help me check Luo Yunsong's background

161
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,920
before he joined the army.

162
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,220
Get more information.

163
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,210
Yes, Master.

164
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,270
Yunqi.

165
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:14,870
What you've done

166
00:10:14,870 --> 00:10:16,880
makes me confused.

167
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:23,980
Are you afraid that the world still isn't messy enough?

168
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,080
Notify the men of the Qian Li Huo under the bell tower

169
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,960
to retreat.

170
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,090
Stop watching.

171
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,190
Letting them come in and out

172
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,450
in front of us...

173
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:37,710
Yes, Master.

174
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,970
It's embarrassing.

175
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,740
Brother, in that case,

176
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,250
Yunqi agreed?

177
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:49,850
Yes, reluctantly.

178
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,950
But it depends on our performance

179
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,090
if we can really cooperate in the future.

180
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,180
Great.

181
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,160
Brother.

182
00:10:57,410 --> 00:10:58,330
Wait.

183
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:00,100
How did you know he would go to Tianjin?

184
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,360
By analyzing.

185
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,870
What did you analyze upon?

186
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,420
Your brother is a soldier.

187
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,730
Analyzing and gathering information

188
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,780
is the most basic thing.

189
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,120
When I found Ding Yunqi

190
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,250
suddenly gathered

191
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,640
with all the informants,

192
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,990
I knew he would take action.

193
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:16,180
No, brother.

194
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:17,610
You have to tell me

195
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:18,660
what happened

196
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:19,710
in Tianjin in detail again.

197
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,480
I think you hide too many things

198
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,650
from me.

199
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,120
Special agent,

200
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,010
you just need to stay here.

201
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,990
Leave the rest

202
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,460
to us subordinates.

203
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:34,200
Brother.

204
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,250
No.

205
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,470
You have to tell me.

206
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,690
-Brother. -No.

207

[Taiyi Private Bank]

208
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,970
Who is it?

209
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,150
Coming.

210
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:21,950
[Taiyi Private Bank]

211
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,420
See?

212
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,140
He still cares about you.

213
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,000
Come on, you two.

214
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,130
Why bother?

215
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,020
If he really meant it,

216
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,700
why didn't he show up?

217
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:11,480
I guess he doesn't know what to say.

218
00:13:11,890 --> 00:13:13,190
Then he has nothing to say.

219
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:15,500
He's said what he had to say.

220
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,010
Disciples of Penta-sect

221
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,220
don't have to keep the oath anymore.

222
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,840
It's your turn now.

223
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:22,260
What should I say?

224
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,440
See?

225
00:13:23,570 --> 00:13:25,500
You can't blame Ding Yunqi.

226
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,130
You two both have to say something.

227
00:13:27,510 --> 00:13:29,280
He has said what he should.

228
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,240
Now it's your turn.

229
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,550
You don't know what to say.

230
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,100
How could you blame Ding Yunqi for that?

231
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,490
He didn't tell me that.

232
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,130
He told the brothers.

233
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,600
You...

234
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,110
Don't be stubborn.

235
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,540
Master said

236
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,140
we'll go back to the headquarters immediately.

237
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:45,240
We don't know when we'll leave.

238
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:46,830
If you want to say something by then,

239
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,470
who you can talk to?

240
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,030
Everyone knows that Master loves you dearly.

241
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,680
If you beg Master,

242
00:13:54,170 --> 00:13:55,910
maybe he will agree to let you stay.

243
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,640
What for?

244
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,220
He didn't even admit the engagement.

245
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,700
Stay so that we can kowtow and become brothers?

246
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,050
So what?

247
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:04,940
At least kowtow first.

248
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,660
As long as you can be together,

249
00:14:06,870 --> 00:14:07,540
I think what your relationship is

250
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,230
isn't important.

251
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,980
I think it's important.

252
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,920
Men are different from women.

253
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,100
Men

254
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:18,130
always have something more important to do.

255
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:20,480
You're right.

256
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,620
Men and women are indeed different.

257
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,010
This is the only thing I have to do.

258
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,190
I can't make do with it.

259
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,650
Then are you really willing to let him go?

260
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,100
If it doesn't belong to me in the fist place,

261
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,060
why should I be unwilling?

262
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,360
I think you have a point.

263
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,300
Wu Shuang.

264
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,560
These dough twists are so delicious. Do you want to try them?

265
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,690
I have toothache these days.

266
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,490
I can't eat hard food.

267
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:49,500
Take it.

268
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,550
Wu Shuang, let me tell you.

269
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,060
I haven't finished packing.

270
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,020
Take them away.

271
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,540
I'll take them all then.

272
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:55,540
Take them away.

Have you visited

291
00:16:52,810 --> 00:16:54,280
your little brother, Heaven Official, lately?

292
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:57,590
I only joined in the fun on occasion. Why would I visit him?

293
00:16:59,330 --> 00:17:01,630
I still think you should visit him.

294
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,740
What do you want to know, Commander?

295
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,510
Haven't you heard?

296
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,319
He's been very arrogant lately.

297
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,210
He even wants to disband Penta-sect.

298
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,270
I've heard about

299
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,700
some rumors.

300
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,150
This little wolf has been too arrogant lately.

301
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,420
He must be trying to keep

302
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:25,400
the treasure of the Kunlun Mountains to himself.

303
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,720
Penta-sect has hundreds of years of history. And he just disbanded it at will?

304
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,490
I like it.

305
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,440
Help me look into it and observe.

306
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,500
See if you can get some information.

307
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:42,150
Even if there is,

308
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,370
we can't believe it.

309
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:46,400
It's better than nothing.

310
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,620
We need to know ourselves and our enemy.

311
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:49,880
Fine.

312
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:51,310
I'll check it out for you.

313
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,540
But

314
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:56,850
I have no reason to go find him now.

315
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,190
Do you know how to solve the divinatory symbol of Heavenly Thunder without Delusion?

316
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:04,580
How would I know that?

317
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,120
Ding Yunqi knows.

318
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:26,290
We're going home tomorrow.

319
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,100
I came here with the intention

320
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,780
to find Ding Yuanshan

321
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:37,300
and figure out the whole story of this matter,

322
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:41,500
and try to revive Penta-sect.

323
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,080
I didn't expect it to be like this.

324
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,690
People in the martial artists community

325
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:58,170
have been coveting the Kunlun Mountains.

326
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:01,780
But it's hard to find the trace, and they feared Penta-sect,

327
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,770
so they didn't know how to do it.

328
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,330
Yunqi announced to disband Penta-sect.

329
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:10,390
The news has spread throughout the martial artists community.

330
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,010
I'm afraid all forces

331
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:15,560
are waiting for a chance to act.

332
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:18,460
As for the Kunlun Mountains,

333
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,730
I will protect it with my life.

334
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,400
But Yunqi...

335
00:19:26,770 --> 00:19:29,130
Since he has announced the disbandment,

336
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,270
I have no position

337
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,440
to protect him.

338
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,060
Now everyone is in a dilemma.

339
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,250
We can't find any excuse to alleviate it.

340
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:41,890
Master,

341
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:42,940
you...

342
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,080
Are you not angry with Yunqi anymore?

343
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,650
I was indeed angry that day.

344
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:50,710
But then I thought about it.

345
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:54,110
Ding Yuanshan died of injustice.

346
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,890
Yunqi vented his anger on Penta-sect

347
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,410
and disbanded Penta-sect in grief.

348
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:00,920
It makes sense.

349
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,770
But what he did

350
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,430
has a bad influence on Penta-sect.

351
00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:11,380
And he won't

352
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,970
compensate for

353
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:13,900
the consequences of what he did.

354
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,970
Do you know what this means?

355
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,450
There will be

356
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:26,750
a bloody storm in the martial artists community soon.

357
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,440
No way, Master.

358
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,810
Yunqi and Luo Yunsong just came back from Tianjin.

359
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,920
They went to find the former Sect Leader of Mountain-demounting

360
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:43,840
for the Soul Pursuit Order.

361
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,790
I don't know

362
00:20:47,790 --> 00:20:48,670
whether they got it or not.

363
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,560
But the former sect leader

364
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,490
and his disciples

365
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,840
were poisoned to death.

366
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:56,400
No.

367
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,780
Yunqi wouldn't have killed anyone.

368
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,380
I know he wouldn't.

369
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,240
But he disbanded Penta-sect

370
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,800
and insisted on opening the Kunlun Mountains.

371
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:09,080
This decision will definitely cause a series of slaughter.

372
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,040
Yunqi can't distinguish the enemy from friends.

373
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:15,470
I'm afraid

374
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,980
he doesn't even know

375
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,570
he's in danger now.

376
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,640
It's not right.

377
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,570
Why is Yunqi

378
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,710
with Luo Yunsong?

379
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:27,690
That's what I'm worried about.

380
00:21:28,570 --> 00:21:29,790
Yunqi is still young and hasn't been in the community for long.

381
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,820
It's not difficult for Luo Yunsong and his sister

382
00:21:34,030 --> 00:21:35,120
to fool him.

383
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:37,310
Previously,

384
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:38,860
due to Luo Jiutian's matter,

385
00:21:39,910 --> 00:21:40,790
Mound-digging Sect has already

386
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,720
had a grudge against Luo Yunsong.

387
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,450
Now he's involved with Yunqi.

388
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,800
It's not known what kind of disaster

389
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,390
will happen in the future.

390
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,380
But

391
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,850
in fact, Fengling is quite nice.

392
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,630
At the critical moment,

393
00:21:57,550 --> 00:21:58,470
blood is thicker than water.

394
00:21:58,770 --> 00:22:00,240
It's more than clear

395
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,500
which one's closer.

396
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,410
Yunqi.

397
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,640
He wants to retrieve the Soul Pursuit Order of Penta-sect.

398
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,250
Then it must be used to open the Kunlun Mountains.

399
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,100
So his next move

400
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,870
will definitely be about this.

401
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:19,430
By then,

402
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,490
there will be

403
00:22:21,490 --> 00:22:24,130
a bunch of people coming for this.

404
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:26,280
What should we do?

405
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:28,420
He's alone and powerless now.

406
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,850
In the future,

407
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,990
more dangers are yet to come.

408
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:36,150
Although I have no position to protect him,

409
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,250
he's the descendant of the Heaven Official after all.

410
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,400
Whether it's Yunqi,

411
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:42,610
or the Kunlun Mountains,

412
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:44,290
as long as there's danger,

413
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,020
I will never sit by and do nothing.

414
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:49,750
Master.

415
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:52,610
Wu Shuang.

416
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,420
I want to assign you a task today.

417
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,840
I'm all yours.

418
00:23:03,910 --> 00:23:04,660
You

419
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:07,520
don't have to go back to the headquarters with the team.

420
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,660
From now on,

421
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,220
follow Yunqi closely.

422
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,120
If anything happens,

423
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,260
report to me immediately.

424
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,310
Master.

425
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:19,620
I know what you want to say.

426
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,680
I've already sorted it out for you.

427
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,290
Go say goodbye to Yunqi.

428
00:23:27,510 --> 00:23:28,310
When he sees you,

429
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,370
he will definitely invite you to look for the Kunlun Mountains with him.

430
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,260
By then,

431
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,940
you can take the chance to stay.

432
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:36,670
But remember,

433
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,490
don't let him know we're in touch.

434
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:42,590
Also,

435
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:44,980
be careful of Luo Yunsong.

436
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,540
He is very scheming.

437
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,270
Got it.

438
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,620
Wu Shuang.

439
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,710
Logically speaking,

440
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,480
if Yunqi disbands Penta-sect,

441
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,660
you two can be together.

442
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,600
But I have my duty.

443
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,450
I can't allow it to happen.

444
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:14,090
You

445
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,790
won't blame me, right?

446
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:21,770
Master.

447
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:23,920
I was raised by you.

448
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:25,220
I will do

449
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,520
whatever you say.

450
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,790
I won't complain at all.

451
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,530
It must be hard for you, kid.

452
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,330
Yunqi

453
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:48,860
is stubborn too.

454
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,210
Maybe he's also

455
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,030
trying his best to be with you.

456
00:24:56,210 --> 00:24:57,350
There should be an ending

457
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,820
to you two's affair.

458
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,350
I'm asking you to go back to him this time

459
00:25:04,190 --> 00:25:05,240
to see

460
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,340
if there will be a chance.

461
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:10,580
Master,

462
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,210
as a disciple of Mound-digging Sect,

463
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,230
it's my duty to protect the Kunlun Mountains.

464
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,250
I have no other request.

465
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:21,750
Don't I know what you're thinking?

466
00:25:25,150 --> 00:25:26,030
I'm sorry for that.

467
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,930
It's nothing.

468
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,760
OK.

469
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,700
I agreed to cooperate with Luo Yunsong

470
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,040
to see

471
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:49,890
what he's up to.

472
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,160
I can see it more clearly

473
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,510
if I keep him by my side.

474
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:59,130
I was wondering why Yunqi agreed.

475
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:01,140
I knew it.

476
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:02,780
I didn't think it through.

477
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,540
We can indeed see it more clearly

478
00:26:04,670 --> 00:26:06,270
by his side.

479
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:07,990
That's right.

480
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,460
There are so many opponents.

481
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,220
We can't just guess.

482
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,590
It's easier to have an open deal.

483
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:20,920
Yunqi.

484
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,190
What about the Soul Pursuit Order?

485
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,960
Everyone knows about the Soul Pursuit Order.

486
00:26:26,470 --> 00:26:27,730
It's naturally hard to collect.

487
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,460
I announced in public

488
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,890
to take back the Soul Pursuit Order.

489
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,330
I just wanted to see

490
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,980
how many people haven't revealed themselves.

491
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:41,000
Since you're all here,

492
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,020
I have something to ask you.

493
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,240
Speaking of "asking us",

494
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,420
it has nothing to do with me.

495
00:26:46,630 --> 00:26:47,890
Listen carefully, Sister.

496
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:49,060
He's asking you.

497
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,420
Go ahead, brother.

498
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,560
What is it?

499
00:26:54,310 --> 00:26:54,990
Sister,

500
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,580
do you know about the Book of Ban?

501
00:26:58,430 --> 00:26:59,690
I do know about

502
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,910
the Book of Ban.

503
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,050
I don't know

504
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,980
what's written

505
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,780
in the Book of Ban,

506
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,540
but

507
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,220
this is an heirloom of movers.

508
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,450
Am I right, Sister?

509
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:11,410
You are right, Brother.

510
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,050
Brother,

511
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:15,980
you want the Book of Ban?

512
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,170
Do you know where it is?

513
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:19,930
It's in the Mountain-moving Town

514
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,150
in the Movers' Headquarters.

515
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:23,670
Yunqi.

516
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,430
Why do you want the book?

517
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,210
You don't have to tell me.

518
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:30,810
I was just asking.

519
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,640
There's nothing to hide from you.

520
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,360
According to the Book of Su...

521
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,160
Yunqi.

522
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,760
You don't have to tell us what the Book of Ban does.

523
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,150
If you want it,

524
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:43,750
I'll get it for you.

525
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,740
But I can't go to Mountain-moving Town with you now.

526
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,470
I'll give the map

527
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,610
and the trap layout in the town

528
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:53,620
to Brother.

529
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,090
If you need anything,

530
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,980
just send someone to inform me.

531
00:27:58,910 --> 00:27:59,580
There's no mover on duty

532
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,010
in Mountain-moving Town?

533
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,270
It's empty for long.

534
00:28:02,980 --> 00:28:04,450
When the headquarters were exposed,

535
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,550
Master sent all his disciples

536
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:07,980
to split up and hide.

537
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,830
The town became empty.

538
00:28:10,250 --> 00:28:11,760
But the Book of Ban is hidden in a secret room.

539
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:13,020
It's well kept.

540
00:28:14,070 --> 00:28:15,200
Please get it for me, Sister.

541
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,420
I'll tell

542
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:17,850
Luo Yunsong later.

543
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,240
Once we get the map,

544
00:28:19,610 --> 00:28:20,620
we'll take action.

545
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,710
You are leaving in such short notice.

546
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,230
I'm indeed a bit sad.

547
00:28:31,830 --> 00:28:32,380
Sister,

548
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:33,640
why don't you come up with a way

549
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:35,610
to go around the martial artists community with us?

550
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,810
Commander Hu is not easy to fool.

551
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:41,750
If I go with you,

552
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,720
he will be suspicious.

553
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:47,160
And I always feel that

554
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:49,100
Fatty is hiding something

555
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,310
that I don't know about.

556
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,930
He's been pretending to be crazier and crazier these days.

557
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,480
Based on what I know about him,

558
00:28:56,030 --> 00:28:58,000
Fatty must be up to something.

559
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,440
I have to figure it out.

560
00:29:05,390 --> 00:29:06,320
By the way, Yunqi,

561
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,000
how to solve the divinatory symbol of Heavenly Thunder without Delusion?

562
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,100
Commander Hu

563
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,290
is waiting for Young Heaven Official to decipher the divinatory symbol.

564
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:25,430
When are we leaving, Yunqi?

565
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:27,270
There's no rush.

566
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,660
There are a few words

567
00:29:28,870 --> 00:29:30,090
that we need to make clear.

568
00:29:30,550 --> 00:29:31,390
Go ahead, Yunqi.

569
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,690
If you need anything,

570
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,080
I'll try my best to satisfy you.

571
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:35,340
It's not a need.

572
00:29:35,590 --> 00:29:36,430
It's a request.

573
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,130
Besides,

574
00:29:42,390 --> 00:29:44,330
you must do it unconditionally.

575
00:29:45,210 --> 00:29:46,380
If you break any rules,

576
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,730
we'll part ways

577
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,910
and live our separate lives.

578
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,850
Okay, go ahead.

579
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,450
This time,

580
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:57,470
including the whole process

581
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,860
of looking for the Kunlun Mountains,

582
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,630
I'll be in charge.

583
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,110
No problem.

584
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,380
No lead.

585
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,440
No interference.

586
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:10,780
No disobedience.

587
00:30:13,350 --> 00:30:14,730
After we find the Kunlun Mountains,

588
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,370
I'll have the right to allocate.

589
00:30:16,710 --> 00:30:17,670
Can you do that?

590
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:21,580
-Yunqi. -Yes.

591
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,580
We want different things.

592
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,380
What you want is the Kunlun Mountains,

593
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:30,940
while what I want is a chance to turn the tables.

594
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:32,750
So,

595
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,260
your request is not too much.

596
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,860
It's very fair.

597
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:37,660
Also,

598
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:39,260
your Black Feather Team

599
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,350
can't join us.

600
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,330
I don't want to draw too much attention.

601
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,300
Reasonable.

602
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:46,530
I'll let them follow up in secret.

603
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,530
At the same time,

604
00:30:47,870 --> 00:30:49,000
I will prepare two cars.

605
00:30:49,590 --> 00:30:51,020
The expenses and weapons on the way

606
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:52,240
will also be covered by us.

607
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,340
Yunqi.

608
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:56,610
What else do you want?

609
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,580
You don't need to bring guns.

610
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,060
I don't want to see more people

611
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,570
die because of the Kunlun Mountains.

612
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:07,570
If you are willing, Mr. Luo,

613
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,830
I want to

614
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,010
hear more about

615
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,860
the Penta-sect you know.

616
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,500
Of course,

617
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,130
if you're willing to do so.

618
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,700
Yes, I am.

619
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:21,970
Okay.

620
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:23,230
See you the day after tomorrow.

621
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:30,540
See you.

622
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,460
Goodbye.

623
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,540
Yunqi agreed to cooperate.

624
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,470
Why can't I tell that you're happy?

625
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,350
Power is really amazing.

626
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:55,240
When he has the power,

627
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,840
the man's really different.

628
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:01,660
How different?

629
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,770
Brother, look at Yunqi.

630
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,210
He became so cold all of a sudden.

631
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,210
Realistic

632
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:10,020
and arrogant.

633
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,560
I don't think there's a problem.

634
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,340
He's become realistic now.

635
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,640
That's why he agreed to cooperate with us.

636
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:22,660
This is not cooperation.

637
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:24,800
We're just like his subordinates.

638
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,780
You're right, Brother.

639
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,440
Power is really a good thing.

640
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:36,020
Power is always a good thing.

641
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:38,070
But remember, Fengling,

642
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,130
in front of the Kunlun Mountains,

643
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,280
everyone in the world is its subordinate.

644
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:46,100
What?

645
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,900
Are you not used to it?

646
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,720
I'll take my time.

647
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,020
Whatever.

648
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,570
I'll report to Her Ladyship first.

649
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,760
After all, we got Yunqi.

650
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,350
This is good news.

651
00:32:58,490 --> 00:32:59,540
That's it.

652
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:00,750
When we do big things,

653
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,180
don't mind the details.

654
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,320
Okay.

655
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,030
Why are you standing here?

656
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,250
Why not go in?

657
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:41,410
I was just passing by.

658
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,710
Why should I go up there?

659
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,020
There's no reason not to enter your own home.

660
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,200
Maybe San Jin has prepared the food.

661
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,560
Who said this is my home?

662
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,370
Why not?

663
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:53,550
The hammock is still here.

664
00:33:54,470 --> 00:33:55,270
Let's go

665
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:07,360
San Jin.

666
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,750
Let me see if it's cooked.

667
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,100
Again? You'll finish it if you try it again.

668
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,030
How can I not know whether it's cooked or not?

669
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:14,710
So stingy.

670
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:17,150
Young Master.

671
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:18,120
-Yunqi. -Wu Shuang.

672
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,010
Miss Wu Shuang.

673
00:34:20,969 --> 00:34:21,900
Smell it.

674
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,830
How is my stewed meat? Does it smell good?

675
00:34:24,750 --> 00:34:25,550
No wonder

676
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:27,060
I wanted to stew meat this morning.

677
00:34:27,489 --> 00:34:28,560
It's because you're back.

678
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:31,639
Take a look.

679
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,989
Is our meat good?

680
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,969
Eat as much as you want today.

681
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:38,570
Do your best. There's enough meat.

682
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:39,909
Yes, Wu Shuang.

683
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:42,179
Let's eat as much as we can today.

684
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,190
Eat to our content.

685
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:44,659
And let's have a drink, too.

686
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,170
Brother.

687
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,520
I asked Miss Wu Shuang to have as much as she can,

688
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,949
not you.

689
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:51,550
Your share

690
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,770
has already been eaten up when it was half-cooked.

691
00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:54,820
I...

692
00:34:55,449 --> 00:34:57,640
I've been busy for a while, right?

693
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,780
You have to make sure there's enough for me, San Jin.

694
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,700
No.

695
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:01,840
Brother.

696
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:03,100
No use.

697
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:04,310
Master San.

698
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:07,720
Stingy.

699
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,470
What's wrong?

700
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,650
It's not sweet.

701
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,670
No way.

702
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,900
I put it on your bed because it's very sweet.

703
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:40,980
Yunqi.

704
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,740
Actually, I'm here today

705
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:45,050
to say goodbye.

706
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:46,650
I'm going back to the headquarters.

707
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,530
Do you have to go?

708
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,180
Mound-digging Sect is my home.

709
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,040
Where else can I go?

710
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,010
Penta-sect has been disbanded.

711
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,230
There's no Mound-digging Sect anymore.

712
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:05,170
Yunqi.

713
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:08,700
Only after I heard

714
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:10,080
you disbanded Penta-sect that

715
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:11,430
I realized what home is.

716
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:16,930
Home

717
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,690
is just some people.

718
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:20,880
Guarding these people

719
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:22,890
is to protect home.

720
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:25,750
They are my family,

721
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,720
and my home.

722
00:36:31,290 --> 00:36:32,300
If I don't go home,

723
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,230
where else can I go?

724
00:36:40,490 --> 00:36:41,710
It's not cooked yet. Wait.

725
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,230
You can come with me.

726
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,610
I can also be your family.

727
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,040
In the next two days,

728
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,980
I plan to set out to open the Kunlun Mountains.

729
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,240
I hope you can come with me.

730
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:03,890
I want you to be with me

731
00:37:04,390 --> 00:37:05,650
when the Kunlun Mountains are opened.

732
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,210
Let's walk into the Kunlun Mountains together.

733
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,110
Let's return all the stolen treasure in the Kunlun Mountains

734
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,240
to their owners.

735
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,630
By then,

736
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,150
Penta-sect won't need to protect the Kunlun Mountains anymore.

737
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,000
No matter how stubborn your master is,

738
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,980
he has no reason not to dismiss Mound-digging Sect.

739
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,090
By then,

740
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,760
you'll be free.

741
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,240
They can still be your family.

742
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:28,370
But you

743
00:37:29,550 --> 00:37:31,140
will really belong to yourself.

744
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,860
Come with me.

745
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:34,420
Okay?

746
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:38,490
But...

747
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:41,180
But what should I tell Master?

748
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,090
It's simple.

749
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:46,560
Tell him

750
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:49,030
you will stay by my side

751
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,250
and be his informant.

752
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,970
Is that okay?

753
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,010
Why not?

754
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,270
Your master will definitely agree.

755
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:01,760
What if...

756
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,570
I mean hypothetically,

757
00:38:04,830 --> 00:38:06,210
if I really was sent

758
00:38:06,210 --> 00:38:07,470
by Master to supervise you,

759
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,530
will you be angry?

760
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:11,970
No.

761
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,990
Because you won't do that.

762
00:38:21,670 --> 00:38:22,680
Let's eat.

763
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,520
The meat is ready.

764
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,730
-Come on and eat. -Come here.

765
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:25,830
Let's eat.

766
00:38:25,830 --> 00:38:26,920
Miss Wu Shuang, hurry up.

767
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,260
Or Brother will eat it up.

768
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:28,980
Where should we sit?

769
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,320
Here.

770
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,880
Come on.

771
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:36,910
Here are the buns.

772
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,890
Here, put it here.

773
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,030
I'll get you the one with the most lean meat.

774
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:48,920
How is it?

775
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:52,240
Don't just say yes. Is it good?

776
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,140
It's so delicious. This is it.

777
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:57,620
Do you know what a genius is?

778
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:00,260
I'm thinking about

779
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:01,730
studying dough twists for the next step.

780
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,620
I've tried it several times,

781
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:04,880
but it wasn't very successful.

782
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,190
I'll make it for you next time.

783
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,220
Are the dough twists delicious?

784
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:14,250
What are you talking about? I just took a bite.

785
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,010
Is there more? I want more.

786
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,110
Okay.

787
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,870
Let me take one.

788
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:35,920
Open the door.

789
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:40,330
Wu Shuang.

790
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,300
Fengling.

791
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:43,360
Why are you here too?

792
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:45,080
I'll go with you.

793
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,640
Why didn't Yunqi mention it before?

794
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:49,070
It was decided yesterday.

795
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,500
Otherwise, after we go back to the headquarters,

796
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:51,800
how can I say goodbye to you?

797
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,020
It's good.

798
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:54,320
If Wu Shuang comes,

799
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,170
if anything happens on the way, she can take care of you.

800
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,550
It should be good.

801
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,450
But it's not good to have you with us.

802
00:40:04,310 --> 00:40:05,150
No need to look around.

803
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,500
As you said,

804
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,850
Black Feather Team won't be found. Don't worry.

805
00:40:09,690 --> 00:40:11,330
I hope you'll keep your promise.

806
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:12,500
Sure.

807
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,840
Wu Shuang, let's share a car.

808
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:20,270
Wu Shuang.

809
00:40:21,570 --> 00:40:23,040
You haven't taken my car, have you?

810
00:40:25,820 --> 00:40:27,960
Fengling, I'll take Yunqi's car.

811
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,510
Your car is a bit crowded.

812
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,150
Okay.

813
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:31,950
Come on.

814
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:48,080
What are you waiting for?

815
00:40:50,010 --> 00:40:50,550
Get in.
