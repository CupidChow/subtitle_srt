00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,740
That's all for now.

521
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,400
Where can I find a pharmacy?

522
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,210
You're here

523
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,900
to get married, right?

524
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:17,620
What?

525
00:30:17,790 --> 00:30:18,960
Marry whom?

526
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:20,850
Me.

527
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,900
Why? Why would I marry you?

528
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,090
You're playing dumb.

529
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:27,700
What do you mean?

530
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:28,880
I'm here to get the dragon bone.

531
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,180
Why would I marry you?

532
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,400
Everyone in the Penta-sect knows

533
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,960
the dragon bone is a betrothal gift.

534
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,610
Aren't you here to get the dragon bone for marriage?

535
00:30:36,610 --> 00:30:37,060
No.

536
00:30:37,610 --> 00:30:38,580
I'm not from the Penta-sect.

537
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,510
I didn't know there was such a rule.

538
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:43,150
You're the only son of the Ding, the Heaven Official Family.

539
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,410
How could you not know?

540
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,090
No, I...

541
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:46,470
I really don't know.

542
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:48,070
You saw what happened that day.

543
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:48,910
Just like today,

544
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,170
just like when you gave away the dragon bone,

545
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,260
I had no choice.

546
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,790
Then why didn't you give it to others?

547
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,380
What do you mean?

548
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:58,650
I only know you. Who else can I give it to?

549
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,690
See. That's the coincidence.

550
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:01,760
What if it's a man?

551
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,730
If I give the dragon bone to a man,

552
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:03,860
should I marry a man?

553
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,590
Whether it's a coincidence or not,

554
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:07,890
since Master said

555
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,190
you're here to get married,

556
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:10,240
and he also agreed.

557
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,340
And I also admitted it

558
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,430
in front of so many people.

559
00:31:12,430 --> 00:31:13,560
You must marry me.

560
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,330
After you get the dragon bone back,

561
00:31:15,330 --> 00:31:16,460
we must get married.

562
00:31:17,170 --> 00:31:17,780
No.

563
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:19,920
Let me ask you first.

564
00:31:21,110 --> 00:31:22,370
Do you want to marry me?

565
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,850
I...

566
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:26,540
Right, what do you think?

567
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,140
It has nothing to do with

568
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,240
what I think.

569
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,700
Of course it does.

570
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,800
Tell me.

571
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:34,430
I...

572
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,660
Fine.

573
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:40,480
We played together when we were kids.

574
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,670
In the past two days,

575
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:45,230
we experienced many life-and-death situations together.

576
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,660
In my heart,

577
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,420
you are a reliable brother.

578
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,360
But I don't want to marry you.

579
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,120
That's good.

580
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,850
That means you're not crazy.

581
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,860
But Master has betrothed me to you.

582
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:58,420
You must listen to him.

583
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,560
I never lie.

584
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:03,250
I have to do what I say.

585
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:07,440
This is ridiculous.

586
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,500
OMG.

587
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,980
Ding Yunqi.

588
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,170
Look at your upset face.

589
00:32:14,670 --> 00:32:15,800
How despicable.

590
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,190
You're not responsible at all.

591
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,450
It's just a marriage.

592
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,420
There's already such a coincidence.

593
00:32:20,420 --> 00:32:21,810
It'll be fine to go through it.

594
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,450
Do you think I'm willing to marry you?

595
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,090
If I knew the dragon bone was a betrothal gift,

596
00:32:25,090 --> 00:32:26,690
I wouldn't have accepted it.

597
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,570
I didn't say it was a betrothal gift.

598
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:29,970
You didn't say it wasn't.

599
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,800
The Qing Dynasty has been destroyed for so long.

600
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:36,060
Why do you still have such antique ideas?

601
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:37,730
You're so fashionable.

602
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,380
I'm against old-fashioned marriage.

603
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:42,840
I have to date first before getting married.

604
00:32:43,710 --> 00:32:44,430
Dating?

605
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,200
Yes.

606
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,810
How? Have you ever been in a relationship?

607
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,570
Mr. Zhou.

608
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:02,230
The director said sorry

609
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:03,680
to disturb you.

610
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,400
Our men are leaving.

611
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,590
Your shop can be

612
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,180
open now.

613
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:14,790
What about Wu Shuang?

614
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,710
She is with Ding Yunqi.

615
00:33:18,380 --> 00:33:21,430
Forget about her relationship with Young Master Jiutian.

616
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:23,160
We will never mention it again.

617
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,800
What about my two disciples?

618
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:31,440
It's not in my charge.

619
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,710
The director didn't tell me that.

620
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:35,060
I dare not say anything.

621
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:39,800
Okay.

622
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:41,900
Goodbye.

623
00:34:08,989 --> 00:34:09,750
Come out.

624
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:17,560
Where am I?

625
00:34:18,469 --> 00:34:19,300
Hush.

626
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,080
Come with me. Quickly.

627
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:49,420
Hurry.

628
00:35:12,030 --> 00:35:13,220
This way.

629
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,490
Don't look back.

630
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,270
They...

631
00:35:22,910 --> 00:35:24,210
Did you

632
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,560
dig the tunnel?

633
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,830
Oh, no. Let's go.

634
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:40,670
Run!

635
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,940
Don't worry. They're not Luo Yunsong's men.

636
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,670
We still have to leave quickly.

637
00:35:48,110 --> 00:35:48,950
Wu Shuang,

638
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:51,130
I have to talk to your master.

639
00:35:51,930 --> 00:35:53,680
I think you want me to be punished.

640
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,280
Leave now.

641
00:35:54,870 --> 00:35:59,150
[Taiyi Private Bank]

642
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,420
Go.

643
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:01,800
Stop following me.

644
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:13,820
Go back to your master's, okay?

645
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,590
I want the dragon bone back.

646
00:36:15,870 --> 00:36:17,170
I'll figure out a way for the dragon bone.

647
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,180
Don't think about it.

648
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,060
No.

649
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,910
The dragon bone is the betrothal gift you gave me.

650
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,240
I must get it back myself

651
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,290
and give it to you.

652
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:25,360
You are still mentioning the betrothal gift?

653
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,590
Ding Yunqi, I'm firm on this.

654
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,900
I don't admit the engagement.

655
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,110
Whether you admit it or not,

656
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,420
the engagement exists.

657
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:33,620
It exists in my heart.

658
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:35,970
I will tell you the truth

659
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,490
about why this is impossible.

660
00:36:39,470 --> 00:36:41,240
I don't like traditional marriages.

661
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:41,910
Also,

662
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,630
I'm not sure my father is dead or alive now.

663
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:45,760
I'm not in the mood to think about this.

664
00:36:46,650 --> 00:36:47,580
I object

665
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,930
the shitty rules of Penta-sect...

666
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:51,230
I won't join Penta-sect

667
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:52,830
or become a Heaven Official.

668
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,590
If I don't become a Heaven Official,

669
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:56,860
will the engagement be invalid?

670
00:36:59,210 --> 00:37:01,230
But you are the son of the Heaven Official.

671
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,700
Just because I'm the son of the Heaven Official,

672
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,540
I'm more against Penta-sect than anyone else.

673
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,760
So you oppose me, too?

674
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:08,790
Wu Shuang.

675
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:11,240
We were young and immature.

676
00:37:11,310 --> 00:37:13,040
Now we've grown up and changed.

677
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,240
I haven't changed. You've changed.

678
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:18,780
I hate you.

679
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,660
You haven't changed.

680
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:25,010
But you are annoying even if you never change.

681
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:29,550
I won't change and will keep annoying you.

682
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,350
I'm going to ask Luo Jiutian for the dragon bone.

683
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,190
Are you done?

684
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:34,030
No.

685
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,500
Wu Shuang, come back!

686
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,770
OK, come with me to get the dragon bone.

687
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:52,880
But let me make it clear first.

688
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,400
Listen to me for everything,

689
00:37:56,030 --> 00:37:58,290
and don't mention the engagement again.

690
00:37:58,890 --> 00:37:59,770
Fine.

691
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,410
But you must remember

692
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,750
you owe me a wedding.

693
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,200
I don't owe you anything.

694
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,340
I haven't eaten for a day. I'm so hungry.

695
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,350
Okay, I'll take you to eat.

696
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:33,820
-Brother. -Young Master.

697
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,880
I'm sorry, Brother.

698
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:46,320
I hurt you that day.

699
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:48,200
Thank you for your mercy.

700
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:48,950
I owe you.

701
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,000
Go cook.

702
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:53,040
We've run out of raw materials. I'll go buy some.

703
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:58,710
Do you think you can settle this with a few words?

704
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,750
Or what?

705
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:02,350
We have to settle this.

706
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,870
We must.

707
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:05,790
Yes.

708
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,400
Brother, I'm so tired today.

709
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,280
I don't want to fight or quarrel.

710
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:11,930
Can we settle it another day?

711
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,610
We have to pick a time you prefer

712
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:14,700
to settle things?

713
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:23,050
Little girl, I'm talking to you.

714
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,500
Of course.

715
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:28,850
I'll be honest with you.

716
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,090
If I used the style master told me,

717
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,800
I would aim at your neck.

718
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:35,070
I deliberately avoided that to save your life.

719
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:36,400
And it became a mistake.

720
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:40,910
You little girl.

721
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:42,000
You mean

722
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,340
you let me go that day.

723
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,620
Did you finally understand?

724
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:48,300
You little girl.

725
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,100
Let's settle it now.

726
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,290
Okay, I'll do it.

727
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:55,350
Brother.

728
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,580
It's not me.

729
00:39:57,790 --> 00:39:59,220
It's my six brothers.

730
00:39:59,380 --> 00:39:59,930
My six brothers

731
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,190
all died in their Mound-digging Tactics.

732
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,580
They were not dead. They were just injured.

733
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:04,470
Master said

734
00:40:04,550 --> 00:40:06,310
since you broke the tactics, it's useless to keep them.

735
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,920
Don't you know that they were released long ago?

736
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,050
Released?

737
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:11,730
Yes.

738
00:40:13,450 --> 00:40:15,160
That's a right thing Zhou should do.

739
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,690
What about the dragon bone?

740
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:18,490
Did you get the dragon bone back?

741
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:20,800
I lost it.

742
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,060
Lost it?

743
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,790
How did you lose it?

744
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,390
Feed it to Luo Jiutian. What’s wrong?

745
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:27,150
You...

746
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,840
I won't let you off!

747
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:30,630
Brother.

748
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:36,060
Brother, is the wound on your chest healed?

749
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,980
It's just a scratch.

750
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,500
I told you we can't trust this girl.

751
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:42,900
It's not up to you to trust me or not.

752
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,950
Who are you to him?

753
00:40:44,370 --> 00:40:47,390
Do you think he should trust whoever you tell him to trust?

754
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,120
Did he hire you to be his butler?

755
00:40:49,150 --> 00:40:50,500
Dragon bone is a big thing.

756
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,630
He must listen to me.

757
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,350
How long have you and Yunqi

758
00:40:54,650 --> 00:40:56,080
know each other?

759
00:40:56,330 --> 00:40:57,640
I'm deeply bonded

760
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:59,480
with Yunqi's father.

761
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,150
So Brother is a big shot.

762
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:08,260
[Sun Sanxuan]

763
00:41:05,830 --> 00:41:07,040
No wonder your name

764
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:08,350
is on the blackboard.

765
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,560
Of course.

766
00:41:10,530 --> 00:41:11,580
But Brother,

767
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,390
why is my name

768
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,110
also on the blackboard?

769
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,370
[Wu Shuang]

770
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:18,680
I...

771
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,810
Young Master, slow down.

772
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,480
I...

773
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:36,610
Young Master.

774
00:41:37,070 --> 00:41:38,590
I want...

775
00:41:38,590 --> 00:41:39,590
Go back.

776
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:40,940
No, Young Master.

777
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,800
Can you do it with your body like that?

778
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,730
I have guns all over me.

779
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,790
What are you afraid of?

780
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,560
Get lost.

781
00:41:50,850 --> 00:41:51,770
I'll count to three.

782
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,200
Young Master, you are drunk.

783
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,630
Three, three.

784
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:55,550
I'm leaving.

785
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,310
Two.

786
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,480
Leaving.

787
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:03,150
Like I can't handle you anymore.

788
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:10,590
Who parked here?

789
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:12,100
It's so in the way.

790
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,790
It's my car.

791
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:17,350
I didn't recognize it.

792
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,260
People are on board.

793
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,320
Man?

794
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,290
No.

795
00:42:30,370 --> 00:42:31,630
Who stepped on my foot?

796
00:42:31,710 --> 00:42:32,340
No.

797
00:42:32,510 --> 00:42:33,270
No.

798
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,190
No.

799
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:35,330
This...
