[Episode 30]

4
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:41,020
Master was killed by Luo Yunsong.

5
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:43,490
What?

6
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:47,460
I saw it with my own eyes.

7
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,940
I didn't see it with my own eyes.

8
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:54,780
But I believe what Senior said.

9
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,670
And Master

10
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,789
did have wounds on his body.

11
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,440
Why did Luo Yunsong

12
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,830
kill Master?

13
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,290
What else could it be?

14
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,280
Of course it's to get

15
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,579
your beloved Ding Yunqi

16
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,640
down from the Mound-digging Region.

17
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,600
Now that Master is dead,

18
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,800
Ding Yunqi is back.

19
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,680
Senior.

20
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,370
Senior.

21
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,260
She is no longer

22
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:29,770
our Junior anymore.

23
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,120
She is the new Sect Leader of Mound-digging Sect.

24
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,590
You can't talk to her like this.

25
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:34,520
Don't...

26
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:38,450
Don't threaten me with the name of the Sect Leader.

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,930
Luo Yunsong and Ding Yunqi

28
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,210
are brought to Mound-digging Region by Wu Shuang.

29
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,550
She must give a reply to Master

30
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,280
and Mound-digging Sect today.

31
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,870
Wu Shuang.

32
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,440
If you want to take over the position,

33
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,240
you must avenge Master first.

34
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,079
Senior.

35
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,320
I know you always want to be the sect leader.

36
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,620
But I'm not.

37
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:00,560
I just want a home.

38
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,920
Master treated me so well.

39
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,470
I treat him as my father.

40
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,970
I will avenge my father's death.

41
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,060
If I don't take revenge,

42
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,970
I will never be human.

43
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:17,820
Senior Hua.

44
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,130
Did you see Luo Yunsong

45
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,790
kill Uncle Zhou for yourself?

46
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:24,829
Mr. Ding.

47
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,110
You're an outsider.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,329
It's none of your business.

49
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,220
Mr. Ding.

50
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,280
If your identity is

51
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,510
the husband of the new Sect Leader of Mound-digging Sect.

52
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,440
Everyone in Mound-digging Sect will treat you well.

53
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:46,840
But if your identity is

54
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:48,600
Luo Yunsong's brother,

55
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,079
please leave.

56
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,730
Don't get me wrong.

57
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,780
I just don't want anybody

58
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,090
to fight before things are clear.

59
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,420
Otherwise friends will suffer while enemies will benefit.

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,600
Senior Hua.

61
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,910
You haven't answered me yet.

62
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:07,500
Yunqi.

63
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,080
Go back first.

64
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,100
Send a message to Luo Yunsong for me.

65
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,140
At this time tomorrow,

66
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,320
I will kill him.

67
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:23,810
Wu Shuang.

68
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:25,070
If you don't want to go,

69
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:27,210
I'll let someone else go.

70
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:29,420
Also,

71
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:34,980
I hope you can stay out of Mound-digging Sect's business.

72
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:53,780
There are still many doubts about

73
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,040
Zhou Qiuhai's death.

74
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,980
Biao followed Tian Long

75
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,040
to the door of Zhou Qiuhai's  Zen room.

76
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,270
I followed him in.

77
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:04,680
Zhou Qiuhai was dead when I went in.

78
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:07,290
There are no obvious signs of fighting in the room.

79
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,490
Then how did Tian Long

80
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:10,330
disappear without a trace

81
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,510
in such a short time

82
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,040
after killing Zhou Qiuhai?

83
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:14,910
Brother.

84
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,700
Zhou Qiuhai was ordinary in martial arts.

85
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:20,240
It's normal to be killed by Tian Long's attack.

86
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:20,830
But...

87
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,650
the problem is Zhou Qiuhai is not Tian Long.

88
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,020
Then who is Tian Long?

89
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:30,740
Brother! Brother San!

90
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:31,790
Say it.

91
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,740
The men guarding Mound-digging region reported that

92
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,080
Jiang Xuewen sent Wu Shuang and Mr. Ding

93
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,210
out.

94
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,300
They're now at the mound-digging headquarters.

95
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,500
Both of them were out?

96
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,620
Well,

97
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,100
it's normal for Wu Shuang to come out. She's attending Master's funeral.

98
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:45,400
Why is Yunqi released?

99
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,780
I don't know.

100
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,420
I heard that

101
00:05:48,690 --> 00:05:50,820
Jiang Xuewen was very respectful to Wu Shuang

102
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,080
and polite to Mr. Ding.

103
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:54,140
They were escorted there.

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,850
But they walked back

105
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,080
on their own.

106
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,340
OK.

107
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,860
Aiwu, ask our men to keep an eye on them.

108
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,650
Yes.

109
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,890
What is

110
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,860
Mound-digging Sect up to?

111
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,430
I don't care.

112
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:11,690
Let's go there again.

113
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,290
Go again?

114
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,550
Yes.

115
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,650
Wu Shuang and Yunqi are out.

116
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,120
They are both at the mound-digging headquarters.

117
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:18,960
With them,

118
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,470
they will give us a chance to explain.

119
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:22,470
Maybe we can find the real murderer.

120
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:31,570
You know the affection Wu Shuang has

121
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,870
for Zhou Qiuhai.

122
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,590
Do you think she would believe

123
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,400
Hua Xingchen,

124
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,280
the witness

125
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,870
who grew up with her

126
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,920
or my brother?

127
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,340
What do you think we should do?

128
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:45,040
Now Mound-digging Sect disciples

129
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,920
are a group of people

130
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,180
overwhelmed by grief.

131
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,030
We can't predict

132
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:50,420
what they can do.

133
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:51,930
I think

134
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,760
this yard is not safe anymore.

135
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,220
We should evacuate as soon as possible.

136
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,080
We can't leave.

137
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,040
If as what you said,

138
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:02,050
disciples in Mound-digging Sect think I'm the murderer,

139
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,020
if we leave,

140
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,700
Yunqi will be in danger again.

141
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,690
We can't let this happen.

142
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,020
San.

143
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,040
We really have to go to Mound-digging Sect again.

144
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,790
Okay.

145
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,050
Brother.

146
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:14,480
We're now blood feud

147
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:17,040
with Mound-digging Sect.

148
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:18,890
They won't let you go if you're there.

149
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,600
You can't go.

150
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,330
If I don't go, won't they come?

151
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,020
We thought Zhou Qiuhai was Tian Long.

152
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,530
Now Tian Long really killed Zhou Qiuhai.

153
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,960
He wants us to fight each other

154
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:28,930
and kill each other.

155
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,270
When we both lose,

156
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,870
he will take advantage of us.

157
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,710
So,

158
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:34,770
I have to go.

159
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:37,070
It's too dangerous.

160
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,340
I'll send a telegram to Her Ladyship.

161
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,810
When Her Ladyship's army arrives,

162
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,830
we'll make it clear to them.

163
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,720
It'll be too late.

164
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:46,530
Whether it's Tian Long or Mound-digging Sect,

165
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,790
they won't let us wait until reinforcements come here.

166
00:07:48,790 --> 00:07:49,850
As for this matter,

167
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,150
we should handle it as soon as possible.

168
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:52,870
Go now.

169
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,170
-Okay. -Let's go.

170
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,340
Brother.

171
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,900
Can you listen to me once?

172
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,960
Stay here.

173
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,630
If anything happens to me,

174
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,450
let Biao take you away.

175
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,760
I beg you.

176
00:08:10,970 --> 00:08:11,770
Brother!

177
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,780
Biao!

178
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,730
Brother.

179
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,120
I'll leave Fengling to you.

180
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:21,850
Yes.

181
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:23,400
When you see the signal flare,

182
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,530
take Fengling away.

183
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,810
As far as possible.

184
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,620
What about you?

185
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,480
I'll go find you.

186
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,870
Don't worry.

187
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,210
I'm here. Don't worry.

188
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:37,510
Fengling will be fine.

189
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:38,809
I'm fine.

190
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,580
Don't worry.

191
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,460
You just watch him die?

192
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,950
What Brother wants to do is right.

193
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:18,500
Yunqi.

194
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,890
There're something

195
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,200
I want to handle by myself.

196
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,570
We're married now.

197
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,160
No matter what happens,

198
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,170
I will be with you.

199
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,480
Just like how you used to be with me.

200
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:33,960
But

201
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:38,160
I don't want to see you now.

202
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:42,610
I know.

203
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:44,910
I misunderstood Uncle Zhou before.

204
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,230
I will kowtow in front of his coffin

205
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:49,200
and ask him to forgive me.

206
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,100
No.

207
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,790
I'm not blaming you.

208
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,810
I blame myself.

209
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:02,180
Master brought me back to Mound-digging Sect.

210
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:04,910
He took care of me,

211
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,060
taught me calligraphy and martial arts

212
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,410
and raised me up.

213
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,610
Without Master, there's no me.

214
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,030
I used to say

215
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,570
I should be filial to Master

216
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,020
and take care of him.

217
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,230
But I didn't do anything.

218
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,070
It's not your fault.

219
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,090
But at least I should trust him,

220
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,450
not doubt or suspect him.

221
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,390
I thought that evil man

222
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:40,650
was Master.

223
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:44,350
If Master knows,

224
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,870
he would be so sad.

225
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:51,830
I'm sorry.

226
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,510
It's my fault.

227
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,360
I misunderstood Uncle Zhou.

228
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,040
Maybe...

229
00:10:59,010 --> 00:10:59,850
Lao Beifeng

230
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,910
also misunderstood your master.

231
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,640
Your master loves you the most.

232
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,800
He won't blame you.

233
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,280
Yes.

234
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,280
Master loves me the most.

235
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,200
Since young,

236
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:15,370
Master has always favored me.

237
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:17,360
Other apprentices

238
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,170
were very angry about this.

239
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,500
But I...

240
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,260
I always let him down.

241
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:28,530
For you,

242
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:29,960
for my love,

243
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,980
I disobeyed Master

244
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,780
and let him down again and again.

245
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,790
The last time I saw Master,

246
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:42,550
I forced him to consent to my marriage.

247
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:45,560
Master was so angry that he was trembling.

248
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,430
But he still let me get married.

249
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:55,120
He didn't want me to suffer

250
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,760
and asked Senior Jiang to buy me a dowry

251
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,490
and sent me out.

252
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,740
So,

253
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:08,140
I don't want to see you now.

254
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,540
I hate myself when I see you.

255
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,900
I know it's unfair to you.

256
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:17,460
But I have no choice.

257
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,740
I understand.

258
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:23,420
I just hope you can be well.

259

Wu Shuang.

260
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,000
Can I check

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,390
Uncle Zhou's body?

262
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:31,490
I want to see if I can find anything else

263
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,500
other than the wound,

264
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:36,400
so that Uncle Zhou can get justice.

265
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,090
Yunqi.

266
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,690
Master is gone.

267
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,470
Just let him leave quietly.

268
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,220
Senior.

269
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,570
I'll stay here.

270
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,650
Go back and take a rest.

271
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,160
I'm fine.

272
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,320
I want to spend more time with Master.

273
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:38,300
I'm afraid I won't have a chance in the future.

274
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,270
You don't know.

275
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,250
After Master got hurt,

276
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,110
he has not been well.

277
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,500
He didn't want you to be sad.

278
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:55,740
So only Senior Wu and I

279
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,170
know about this.

280
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,490
But I never thought

281
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:04,290
Master would leave like this.

282
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,610
I thought

283
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,720
Luo Yunsong was just trying to save Ding Yunqi.

284
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,360
I didn't expect them to come after Master.

286

What are you doing?

287

You are now our Sect Leader.

288
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,020
It's the rule to show our respect to you.

289
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,870
Master asked me to take over as the sect leader.

290
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,200
Maybe he doesn't want me to suffer in Mound-digging Region.

291
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,860
To be the sect leader,

292
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:38,700
you and Senior Jiang

293
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,840
are more suitable than me.

294
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,570
Master has his

295
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,950
own thoughts.

296
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,160
Now you are our Sect Leader.

297
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,780
We haven't avenged our master.

298
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,910
The disciples in the sect are worried.

299
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:53,490
So you have to take the responsibility

300
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,510
and guard Mound-digging Sect.

301
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,570
I got it, Senior Jiang.

302
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,210
Thank you.

I...

347
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,460
I can't remember anything.

348
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,630
It's okay.

349
00:19:20,050 --> 00:19:21,480
I'll tell you later.

350
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:26,250
It's okay, Wu Shuang.

351
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,760
[Memorial]

352
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,790
[Memorial]

353
00:19:43,490 --> 00:19:44,370
Tian Long.

354
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,810
I can't remember anything.

355
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,370
My parents helped me

356
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:51,850
to find you in this way.

357
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:52,860
Stop talking.

358
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,100
Mound-digging Sect is my home.

359
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,150
Since I'm a disciple of Mound-digging Sect,

360
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,370
I'm an orphan.

361
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,210
Even if you are my brother,

362
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:02,260
so what?

363
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:03,650
If I kill you,

364
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,250
I will end myself

365
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,510
and confess to our parents.

366
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:07,430
It's Tian Long!

367
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:10,370
It's Tian Long!

368
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,570
It was Tian Long who killed Zhou Qiuhai.

369
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:39,850
But I saw it was Luo Yunsong.

370
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,900
I'll say it again.

371
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:43,170
Tian Long led us to the Zan room.

372
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,050
When I came in,

373
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:45,580
Master Zhou was already...

374
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,540
He's dead.

375
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,670
Did Tian Long lure you there?

376
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,120
This is not a place to talk.

377
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,600
Let's go.

378
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:20,420
To be honest,

379
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:23,330
I suspected that Sect Leader Zhou

380
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:24,370
was Tian Long.

381
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,190
In the past,

382
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,290
Wu Yutian disguised as Tian Long

383
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:30,350
and came to our yard

384
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:31,680
to take away

385
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,180
our soul pursuit order.

386
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:36,760
Wu Yutian?

387
00:21:37,220 --> 00:21:38,020
Senior Wu?

388
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:39,490
It's him.

389
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,630
But he has gone missing.

390
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,330
We haven't found him for days.

391
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,040
Yes.

392
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:47,270
Because he's dead.

393
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:49,020
After we exposed his identity,

394
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:51,010
he committed suicide by taking poison.

395
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:53,180
We guess he was eager to die

396
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,850
because he knows many secrets of Tian Long.

397
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,050
So I made him look alive.

398
00:21:58,420 --> 00:21:59,150
As expected,

399
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:00,770
Tian Long really came

400
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,550
and wanted to kill him.

401
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,980
So we followed him

402
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,970
to Mound-digging Sect Headquarters

403
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,030
and met Senior Hua.

404
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,430
You kept stopping us.

405
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,480
I had no choice.

406
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,120
I could only tell Black Feather Team to keep track

407
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,920
until Black Feather Team saw him

408
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,220
and entered Master Zhou's Zen room.

409
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,160
I went in later.

410
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,380
After that,

411
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,790
Master Zhou was found dead.

412
00:22:27,030 --> 00:22:27,710
Brother,

413
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,180
besides this,

414
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,920
did you find anything else?

415
00:22:31,530 --> 00:22:33,710
There are no signs of fighting in the room.

416
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,680
Besides, Master Zhou

417
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,230
is well dressed.

418
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,410
I also saw

419
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:39,260
there's no other door

420
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,220
in the room.

421
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,280
I don't know how he got out.

422
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:46,860
Senior.

423
00:22:47,110 --> 00:22:49,110
Are there any newcomers in our sect?

424
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,050
No.

425
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:52,150
All the workers and servants in Mound-digging Sect

426
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,210
are common people.

427
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,300
No.

428
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,780
After the ghouls rushed into the headquarters,

429
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,670
a bunch of guys

430
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,980
wearing masks in black came.

431
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,820
They are good in martial arts

432
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,150
and have sharp tactics.

433
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,810
Many disciples

434
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,400
were injured

435
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:09,910
because of them.

436
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,080
Why didn't you tell me before?

437
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,500
It's not Senior Hua's fault.

438
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,840
I did fight them.

439
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,150
These people

440
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,780
kept saying

441
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,890
they were ordered by the director.

442
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:23,920
So we thought

443
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:26,590
Mr. Luo transferred them from Shanghai.

444
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,620
Now that I think about it,

445
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,260
it's very strange.

446
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,540
Because they seem

447
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,940
to be familiar with the terrain of our headquarters.

448
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,580
We don't even know

449
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:36,920
how they evacuated.

450
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:39,460
These people must be related to Tian Long.

451
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:40,360
Besides,

452
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,590
Tian Long knows

453
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:44,820
the underground palace of Mound-digging Sect.

454
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,080
It's not strange.

455
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,940
Wu Yutian can die for Tian Long.

456
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,490
It's normal for him

457
00:23:50,490 --> 00:23:51,550
to draw him the map.

458
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,380
That's not right.

459
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,200
Then why did Tian Long kill Master?

460
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,140
And the soul pursuit order of Mound-digging Sect

461
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,650
is still intact and here.

462
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:02,710
Maybe

463
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:05,020
he wants to know the way

464
00:24:05,350 --> 00:24:07,580
to open the Kunlun Mountains from Leader Zhou?

465
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,710
He may think

466
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,360
as an old man of Penta-sect,

467
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,420
Uncle Zhou must know more about the Kunlun Mountains

468
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,220
more than ordinary people.

469
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:17,780
Senior Hua,

470
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,260
please find out

471
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,390
how they got into Mound-digging Sect.

472
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:25,050
Wu Shuang.

473
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:29,380
Can we talk alone?

474
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:40,210
Go ahead.

475
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:44,540
Wu Shuang.

476
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,180
How have you been these years?

477
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,600
Good.

478
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:54,490
I'm doing well.

479
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:56,630
That's good.

480
00:24:56,950 --> 00:24:57,890
That's good.

481
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,840
Is that all you want to talk about?

482
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:06,550
No.

483
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,490
You don't remember

484
00:25:09,490 --> 00:25:10,750
what happened before.

485
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:11,920
I understand.

486
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,420
How about this?

487
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,610
After you avenge your master,

488
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,450
I'll take you back to the yard.

489
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:19,910
I've fixed it.

490
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,450
It's the same as before.

491
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,020
I won't go.

492
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,890
Then go back to mountain-moving

493
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:32,630
and kowtow to father

494
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:34,660
in front of his tomb.

495
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,320
I said I won't go.

496
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:54,890
Why did you abandon me?

497
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:58,790
Since you've given up on me,

498
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,880
why bother finding me back?

499
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,610
Sister!

500
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,660
Over there.

501
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,630
It happened so suddenly that day.

502
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:26,550
I couldn't save you in panic.

503
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:28,780
So I could only carry Fengling

504
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,480
who was a baby then.

505
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,400
Later,

506
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,680
when we returned to the yard,

507
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,120
the whole family was burned to ashes.

508
00:26:40,790 --> 00:26:41,790
You're gone, too.

509
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,270
Did you look for me?

510
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,130
Of course.

511
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,150
Of course.

512
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,220
I didn't think

513
00:26:59,270 --> 00:27:00,570
you are not likely to be alive,

514
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,500
But I never gave up looking for you.

515
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:07,040
You know, Wu Shuang.

516
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,780
Father is the Leader of Mountain Moving Sect.

517
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:13,440
According to the rules, he can't have children.

518
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,270
As his children,

519
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,620
we were not accepted by Penta-sect.

520
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:21,530
So over the years,

521
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:25,270
I could only take Fengling

522
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,700
to run away.

523
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,850
We hid our identities.

524
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:33,670
We even begged along the street.

525
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:36,020
One time, Fengling almost died

526
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,030
because of a cold.

527
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,350
Now that I look back,

528
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:46,930
it's not a bad thing for you in Mound-digging Sect.

529
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,070
At least you didn't wander around with us.

530
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,710
I went to Mound-digging Sect because my master was kind

531
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:55,550
and saved me.

532
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,610
Wu Shuang.

533
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,540
Give me some time.

534
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,550
I'll make it up to you.

535
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,700
No need.

536
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:09,200
I wanted a home when I was young.

537
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,870
You didn't give it to me.

538
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:14,410
Now I have a home.

539
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,720
I don't need you to be my brother.

540
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,460
Let's take it as Heaven's arrangement.

541
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:26,270
Since we are not meant to be,

542
00:28:27,730 --> 00:28:29,330
we don't have to be siblings.

543
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,280
Can I see your lotus mark?

544
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,730
For what?

545
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,970
I'd rather never have this mark.

546
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,550
Leave.

547
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,670
[Memorial]

548
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,240
How was your talk with Brother?

549
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,900
No matter what happened before,

550
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,410
he won't blame you.

551
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,210
I hope he will blame me.

552
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,440
Then he won't want

553
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,400
me back.

554
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:25,150
I know.

555
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,960
I heard that.

556
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:28,350
He had no choice.

557
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,310
Actually, I know.

558
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,760
Luo Yunsong

559
00:30:39,030 --> 00:30:40,740
was just a teenager.

560
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,930
He had no choice but to give me up.

561
00:30:47,030 --> 00:30:48,250
From the fact that he treats

562
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,970
Fengling like a princess,

563
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,740
he is a good brother.

564
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:59,200
My reason tells me that I don't blame him.

565
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:02,240
But my feelings don't allow it.

566
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,720
I understand.

567
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,360
You don't understand.

568
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:10,870
Over the past decade,

569
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,820
I've been asking myself

570
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:15,040
what I did wrong

571
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,900
that I was abandoned by my family.

572
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,250
Am I not worthy to have a family?

573
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,020
Or am I not good enough?

574
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,510
So since young,

575
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,070
I've always been competitive

576
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:29,270
and never give up.

577
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:32,240
I just want to prove that I'm not a loser.

578
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:34,250
How can you be a loser?

579
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,820
You are Wu Shuang, the best

580
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,250
in the world.

581
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,000
You are also my Wu Shuang.

582
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,500
We're married.

583
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:48,600
We're a family.

584
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,500
But Yunqi,

585
00:31:58,810 --> 00:32:00,030
I can't

586
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:01,410
accept this.

587
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,580
When I think about it, I feel so pressed.

588
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:07,420
OK.

589
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,870
I won't pressure you.

590
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,620
I respect all your choices.

591
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,460
But you have to promise me one thing.

592
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:19,520
You didn't sleep well last night.

593
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,490
I want you to go back and rest.

594
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,650
Because there will be

595
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,930
a lot of things

596
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,150
to deal with.

597
00:33:14,910 --> 00:33:16,930
Brother, when did you come back?

598
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:20,210
Did they give you a hard time?

599
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:22,470
Don't worry.

600
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,770
I'm fine.

601
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:26,000
They knew last night

602
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:28,630
that Zhou Qiuhai was killed by Tian Long.

603
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,250
That's good.

604
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,380
Come.

605
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:33,470
Sit here.

606
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,620
I have something to tell you.

607
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,840
Go ahead.

608
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,220
I found your sister.

609
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,670
Sister.

610
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,890
Didn't my sister...

611
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:56,970
She's not dead.

612
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,170
She grew up.

613
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,810
She is a fine lady.

614
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,360
Besides,

615
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:05,390
she has always been by our side.

616
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:06,320
You know her too.

617
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:13,370
You mean

618
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,139
Sister Wu Shuang?

619
00:34:19,340 --> 00:34:21,020
Are you sure?

620
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:22,949
Yes.

621
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,130
But Wu Shuang

622
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,560
can't accept the fact

623
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,110
for the moment.

624
00:34:28,870 --> 00:34:29,670
Fengling.

625
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:32,100
You've been close with Wu Shuang.

626
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,230
I'll take you there.

627
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,920
The three of us can be reunited.

628
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,679
How can you be sure it's her?

629
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:41,030
The lotus mark on your neck.

630
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:42,960
Wu Shuang has it, too.

631
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:44,280
I saw it

632
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,630
with my own eyes.

633
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:46,889
Nothing will go wrong.

634
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,250
Did you see her lotus mark?

635
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,639
I didn't see it, but...

636
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,900
Yunqi saw it.

637
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,610
She doesn't accept us.

638
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:01,920
Why didn't she accept us?

639
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,720
It should be my fault

640
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:09,480
for not bringing her out.

641
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,930
How could she blame you?

642
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,710
You've been feeling guilty all this time.

643
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:18,340
Can't she understand?

644
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,290
Actually,

645
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:25,230
I don't blame her.

646
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:27,120
Fengling.

647
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,280
You've always been by my side.

648
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,040
Yes.

649
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,460
You suffered a lot when you were young.

650
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:37,090
But at least you have your family by your side.

651
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:38,250
And Wu Shuang

652
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,650
was alone in Mound-digging Sect and had no one to rely on.

653
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,650
Zhou Qiuhai gave her a sense of home.

654
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:45,910
But now Zhou Qiuhai is dead.

655
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:48,210
Wu Shuang

656
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:49,590
is suffering from

657
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:51,060
losing her family.

658
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,230
So we need to be more considerate of her.

659
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:55,890
Be considerate?

660
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,030
Is she considerate of you?

661
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,950
She hasn't accepted you as her brother yet.

662
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:02,990
And you are already

663
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,540
partial to her?

664
00:36:08,830 --> 00:36:10,550
Why do you think so?

665
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,020
Both of you are my sisters.

666
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:14,290
Am I wrong?

667
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:16,430
Brother, I know you.

668
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:18,860
You think you owe her.

669
00:36:19,070 --> 00:36:19,960
From now on,

670
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,170
you want to make up for her crazily.

671
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:23,630
In your heart, she is more important than me.

672
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,610
Fengling, you two are sisters.

673
00:36:34,610 --> 00:36:36,340
Why are you so petty?

674
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,910
Shouldn't I?

675
00:36:42,010 --> 00:36:44,360
Brother, I only have you.

676
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:46,500
She already has Yunqi.

677
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:47,470
I only have you.

678
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:48,730
Why does she take everything from me?

679
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,730
Why?

680
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,330
Don't say that.

681
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,850
Am I wrong?

682
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:57,290
I don't want her to be my sister. I don't.

683
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,680
Fengling.

684
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:13,100
Didn't you chase me out long ago?

685
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:14,470
What took you so long?

686
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,350
I don't think you want to die.

687
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,820
Who wants to die?

688
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,090
If I die, they'll do what they want.

689
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:24,150
No one wants you to die.

690
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:26,740
Wu Shuang doesn't. Let alone Brother.

691
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,710
Don't just talk about it.

692
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,410
He Biao.

693
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:38,890
How much do you like me?

694
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,690
You're useless.

695
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,180
Yes.

696
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,640
I'll give you another chance.

697
00:38:52,750 --> 00:38:54,610
You can only choose me or Brother.

698
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,190
Who will you choose?

699
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,240
Brother.

700
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:05,220
But I can give you my life.

701
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,990
Why would I want your life?

702
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:11,690
He Biao.

703
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,790
Am I not good enough?

704
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:15,470
You are good.

705
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:17,860
Then why am I always

706
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,080
in the second place?

707
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,640
Brother thinks so.

708
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,990
You too.

709
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,210
Even if you're in the second place,

710
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:26,730
I can risk my life for you.

711
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:28,070
I don't want it.

712
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,450
I only want to be the only one.

713
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,260
Besides that,

714
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,810
I don't care.

715
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,210
Where are you going?

716
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,180
Just don't follow me.

717
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,630
What are you doing here?

718
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:54,450
Young Master.

719
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:57,600
It's because Luo

720
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,000
had a fight with Miss Chu.

721
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,070
What?

722
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,080
Really.

723
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:03,260
Luo hit Miss Chu.

724
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,280
Miss Chu ran out in the rain.

725
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:06,680
She hasn't come back yet.

726
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,530
Luo and Brother San are drinking in the backyard.

727
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,290
I'll go check.

728
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:13,510
Make some food for him.

729
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:14,270
Okay.

730
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:35,480
Yunqi.

731
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:37,700
He's been drinking for a long time.

732
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,030
He finally fell asleep.

733
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,010
Let him sleep.

734
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,860
Let him get drunk.

735
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,900
The separation of siblings

736
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,400
has been haunting him for decades.

737
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,040
Tell me.

738
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,260
They are siblings.

739
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:51,350
Now they finally met,

740
00:40:51,350 --> 00:40:52,750
but it ended up like this.

741
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,690
We can't get involved in this.

742
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:57,700
Well,

743
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,500
we can't just sit and watch.

744
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,350
We can only keep him company.

745
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,610
Leave the rest to time.

746
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,170
What is this all about?

747
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:22,890
Brother.

748
00:41:24,110 --> 00:41:24,910
Brother.

749
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,760
I fell asleep?

750
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,890
Yes, go to sleep.

751
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:34,400
You're back, Yunqi.

752
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:37,800
Wu Shuang...

753
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,070
Is she alright?

754
00:41:40,910 --> 00:41:41,710
Don't worry.

755
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:43,140
Give her some time.

756
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,670
I didn't expect

757
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,290
it's such a scene for us to recognise each other.

758
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,180
Give her some time.

759
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,650
By the way,

760
00:41:56,370 --> 00:41:58,500
there's something I haven't told you.

761
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,020
Jiutian

762
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:04,100
is still alive.

763
00:42:04,470 --> 00:42:05,310
What?

764
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,240
He works for Her Ladyship.

765
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,640
What happened?

766
00:42:10,190 --> 00:42:11,660
I don’t know the details.

767
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,970
Commander Hu was probably using him.

768
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:16,150
He put on a show with us.

769
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,970
So he has been following us.

770
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:21,950
Yes.

771
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,580
He has a secret connection

772
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,360
with Fengling.

773
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,070
Then he passes the messages to Her Ladyship.

774
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,650
Yunqi.

775
00:42:33,330 --> 00:42:35,220
I know this time...

776
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:36,940
Fengling went too far.

777
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:39,500
Brother.

778
00:42:40,420 --> 00:42:41,940
I hope Fengling can leave.

779
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,290
I'm afraid she will affect our

780
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:45,380
future actions.

781
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:46,390
Also,

782
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:49,240
if she gets caught between us and Her Ladyship,

783
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,840
she'll definitely get hurt.

784
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,160
Even if you didn't say it,

785
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,790
I think so too.

786
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:17,590
But now you see...

787
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,110
I'll talk to her.

788
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,080
Okay.

789
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:21,960
You go talk to her.

790
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,180
It can only be you.

791
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,240
Neither of my two sisters

792
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,410
wants to see me now.
