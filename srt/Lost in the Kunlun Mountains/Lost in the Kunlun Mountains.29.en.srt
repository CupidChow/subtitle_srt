[Episode 29]

4
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,110
Wu Shuang married Ding Yunqi.

5
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,240
I know.

6
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:23,180
When I went to the Mound-digging Region,

7
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,280
I saw her off on her wedding day.

8
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:30,990
But I

9
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,470
personally disagree with this marriage.

10
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:34,390
Besides,

11
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,820
it's the Republic of China. What era is it?

12
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,290
People can divorce after getting married.

13
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,550
Jiutian.

14
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,380
Don't get involved in this.

15
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,470
Leave here.

16
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,770
Stay alive.

17
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:54,950
After I finish my work,

18
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,700
as long as I'm alive,

19
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,670
I'll go and find you.

20
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,980
Let's be good brothers.

21
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:03,540
Don't be good brothers.

22
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:05,940
Just

23
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,440
don't hurt me.

24
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,090
I can protect myself.

25
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:13,320
I'm still protecting you, right?

26
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,940
Don't get involved in this.

27
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,410
Where else can I go?

28
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,770
Besides,

29
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:24,240
if it hadn't been for me,

30
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:26,640
my smart,

31
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,020
cute

32
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,680
and kind sister's

33
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,000
soul pursuit order

34
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:34,500
would have been snatched.

35
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,340
Jiutian.

36
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,360
I'm very happy

37
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,010
to see you today.

38
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,690
Because I saw you alive.

39
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,120
But you don't have to ask me for credit.

40
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:46,880
Listen.

41
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,310
If you hadn't shown up today,

42
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,200
Fengling and the soul pursuit order

43
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,329
would also have been fine.

44
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,050
Are you sure?

45
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,960
So you arranged this?

46
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:02,780
Sister.

47
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,280
So, as a spy,

48
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,450
you didn't know things well?

49
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,260
You were used as a bait.

50
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,430
And you didn't know

51
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,570
you were used as a bait.

52
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,510
Did I say something wrong?

53
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:20,060
I'll slap myself.

54
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:21,779
You guys continue talking.

55
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:22,830
I'm leaving.

56
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:24,850
You can call me

57
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:25,810
when you need me.

58
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,270
If you want to go to the Mound-digging Region

59
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,130
to save Ding Yunqi and Wu Shuang,

60
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:30,980
you can also call me.

61
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:33,180
I'm leaving.

62
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,000
Take care. Thank you.

63
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:39,760
My leg

64
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,020
is really...

65
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,290
I was born to be a cripple.

66
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,480
Open the door and let the dog go.

67
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,640
Thank you. You're pretty.

68
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,030
Did you get married?

69
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,140
Brother.

70
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:02,810
You just let Jiutian go?

71
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,190
The children have grown up.

72
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:10,860
They have their own ideas.

73
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,070
I can't control them anymore.

74
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:43,180
Yunqi.

75
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,010
What are you doing?

76
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,180
I want to connect all the vines

77
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,320
and see how long it is.

78
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:54,300
Do you want to get down with the help of these vines?

79
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,300
I did a small experiment before.

80
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,810
I threw some stones down.

81
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,620
I calculated the distance

82
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:02,250
by those stones.

83
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,690
I want to see if these are enough.

84
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,730
How many vines did you find?

85
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,470
Now I suddenly realize

86
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,290
these vines

87
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,560
seem to have been cut on purpose.

88
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:17,990
That's right.

89
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:19,880
When the disciples of the mound-digging

90
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,020
make mistakes and be punished,

91
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:23,200
they'll be sent here to cut vines.

92
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,770
You people from the mound-digging

93
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,300
are so careful.

94
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,420
Yunqi.

95
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:35,930
Do you want to

96
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:37,650
visit that old lady later?

97
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,580
I think she's not feeling well.

98
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:42,270
OK.

99
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,470
You know that Jiutian is still alive, right?

100
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,550
You met him before.

101
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,690
There's something I don't know about you and Her Ladyship,

102
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,950
right?

103
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,460
You really don't need

104
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,010
to give me an explanation, Fengling?

105
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,030
What do you want me to explain?

106
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,070
Why are you always right?

107
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,450
Why are we the children

108
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,010
who are always wrong?

109
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,690
We always have to explain

110
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,280
and ask for your forgiveness.

111
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:32,120
I never thought

112
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,210
I was always right.

113
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,590
I just want

114
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,100
to try my best to protect you, Fengling.

115
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,250
I don't need your protection.

116
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,730
I need you to believe me.

117
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,040
Believe me. I'm not a child anymore.

118
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,340
I can take care of myself.

119
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,980
I have my own judgment.

120
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,490
Fengling, I know you've grown up.

121
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,030
But seeing you like this, I'm worried about you.

122
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:54,000
Because you don't know

123
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,310
what people will be like

124
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,740
when they face temptations and desires.

125
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,460
Brother.

126
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,550
Brother.

127
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,850
You don't want me to know

128
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,400
your matters anyway.

129
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:25,380
Brother.

130
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:26,260
Have a seat.

131
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,450
How is it?

132
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,880
I'm not sure.

133
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,179
At the beginning,

134
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,360
things happened as we expected.

135
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,159
As soon as we arrived at the mound-digging headquarters,

136
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:36,210
we made trouble

137
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,610
and played hide-and-seek with the people from the mound-digging.

138
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,950
But the people from the mound-digging

139
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:42,679
seemed to be very cooperative as we thought.

140
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,070
They chased us and fought with us all the way.

141
00:08:44,230 --> 00:08:45,960
But no one killed us.

142
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:47,850
And then?

143
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,660
And then things became weirder.

144
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:51,920
Our brothers

145
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,640
tried not to hurt the people from the mound-digging.

146
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:54,900
But many disciples of the mound-digging

147
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:56,040
still got injured.

148
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,630
It caused the people from the mound-digging to be cruel.

149
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,560
They'd been fighting with us for a long time.

150
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,770
It was not easy for us to escape.

151
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,170
Who hurt the disciples of the mound-digging?

152
00:09:02,590 --> 00:09:03,390
I don't know.

153
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,090
They were mysterious. I didn't see them at all.

154
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,070
But

155
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,050
the people from the mound-digging were not seriously injured.

156
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,310
I guess the people who did it

157
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,270
didn't want to kill them.

158
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,140
Brother,

159
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,070
is there someone who helps us secretly?

160
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,750
No.

161
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,770
It's not that simple.

162
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,570
Biao

163
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,920
checked Wu Yutian's corpse.

164
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:24,720
He has a tattoo.

165
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,320
It doesn't belong to the mound-digging.

166
00:09:27,070 --> 00:09:28,120
He should be Tian Long's man.

167
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,910
Wu Yutian worked for Tian Long? This...

168
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,240
Isn't he Zhou Qiuhai's man?

169
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,910
You're right.

170
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:39,790
One thing is for sure.

171
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,030
From the moment we inquired,

172
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,050
Zhou Qiuhai knew about it.

173
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:45,760
He deliberately left a hole

174
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,990
so that we thought we could take advantage of it.

175
00:09:48,110 --> 00:09:49,670
When we came out,

176
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:53,240
he sent someone to threaten Fengling and snatch the soul pursuit order.

177
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,670
Actually,

178
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,440
he could let his disciples

179
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,120
do it openly.

180
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,460
But in this way,

181
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,440
the whole city would know.

182
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,070
So,

183
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,090
he was very cooperative

184
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,570
and sent Wu Yutian to snatch the soul pursuit order.

185
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:10,040
In this case,

186
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,470
the soul pursuit order would be in the hands of Tian Long,

187
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,990
not Zhou Qiuhai.

188
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,140
Brother,

189
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:19,280
You mean...

190
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:20,410
He's Tian Long.

191
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:26,880
No.

192
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,350
This...

193
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,490
How could Zhou Qiuhai be Tian Long?

194
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,950
He's the Sect Leader of the mound-digging.

195
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,720
Yes.

196
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,230
Because he is the Sect Leader,

197
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,620
he can spread false news

198
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:36,830
with his disciples

199
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,030
and let them tangle with us.

200
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,020
Besides,

201
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:40,610
when Wu Yutian came here,

202
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,380
he was dressed like Tian Long.

203
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,550
After we caught him,

204
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,730
he committed suicide by poison.

205
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,180
Besides Tian Long, who else do you think

206
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,590
he would sacrifice his life for?

207
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:50,060
But

208
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:52,390
Zhou Qiuhai's martial arts are mediocre.

209
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,160
Tian Long is definitely a master of martial arts.

210
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,410
It's hard for a loser to pretend to be

211
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:57,540
a master.

212
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,930
But it's easy for a master to pretend to be a loser.

213
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,370
San.

214
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,550
Think about it.

215
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,950
From the moment Yunqi began to look for the Kunlun Mountains,

216
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,420
all Zhou Qiuhai's behavior

217
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:09,720
was suspicious, right?

218
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:12,240
If he was Tian Long,

219
00:11:12,490 --> 00:11:14,760
everything could make sense.

220
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:17,780
You're right.

221
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,250
If Zhou Qiuhai

222
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,550
hadn't followed us sneakily,

223
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:22,020
he wouldn't have fallen into our trap.

224
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,830
We came to the mound-digging

225
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,800
because he lured us here

226
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:27,150
by the soul pursuit order.

227
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:29,120
Brother,

228
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,390
I think what you said makes sense.

229
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,660
But I still can't believe

230
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:34,790
not only did the Sect Leader of the mound-digging

231
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,350
killed our Old Sect Leader,

232
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:37,520
now he also wants the Kunlun Mountains.

233
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,920
This is unbelievable.

234
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,520
Believe it or not, we'll talk about it later.

235
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,330
Anyway, I let Biao

236
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:46,260
make a fiction that Wu Yutian didn't die.

237
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,480
I think Tian Long will show up.

238
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,750
By then,

239
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,010
we'll know

240
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,100
if Zhou Qiuhai is Tian Long.

241
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:15,320
Ma'am.

242
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:28,850
Willow catkins?

243
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,010
Who are you?

244
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:35,420
I'm Ding Yunqi.

245
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,460
The last Heaven Official

246
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,960
Ding Yuanshan is my father.

247
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,370
The last Heaven Official?

248
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,590
Yes.

249
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,600
Are you Ding Yuanshan's son?

250
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,280
Yes.

251
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:56,100
I'm the mountain mover Lao Beifeng,

252
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,990
Heaven Official.

253
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:58,830
Ma'am.

254
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,520
I didn't take over the position. You don't have to bow.

255
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:04,960
[The Sect Leader of the Mountain Moving, Lao Beifeng]

256
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,700
I'm Wu Shuang. I'm from the Mound-Digging.

257
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,260
Hello, Master.

258
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,260
-Ma'am, please sit down. -Ma'am.

259
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:17,140
Have a seat.

260
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,120
Here.

261
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,260
My life

262
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,200
is drawing to a close.

263
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:42,300
Bride,

264
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:45,120
don't frown.

265
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,790
I'm very happy now.

266
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:54,060
Before I die,

267
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,540
I can still see my friend's son.

268
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,650
I'm very satisfied.

269
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,270
Ma'am.

270
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,910
I have a favor to ask.

271
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,160
Just say it. Don't be so hesitant.

272
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,180
Not long ago,

273
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:14,600
my father passed away.

274
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,540
I was ordered to disband the Penta-Sect.

275
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:21,700
From now on, no one needs to follow the rules of the Penta-sect.

276
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,770
Good.

277
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,260
I'm tired of

278
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,690
the disgusting rules of the Penta-sect.

279
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,410
That's good.

280
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,690
If they had been abolished earlier,

281
00:14:38,590 --> 00:14:40,070
my disciples

282
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:43,150
wouldn't have followed my example.

283
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,540
There's one more thing.

284
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:53,110
I want to open the Kunlun Mountains.

285
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:56,310
Before my father passed away,

286
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,020
he wanted to open the Kunlun Mountains

287
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,460
and give the treasures

288
00:15:00,030 --> 00:15:01,840
to the poor.

289
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,770
Your father

290
00:15:11,550 --> 00:15:13,310
always did

291
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,550
many amazing things.

292
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,580
I've opened the Dragon Sceptre.

293
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,060
The ancestors of the Penta-sect left some words inside.

294
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,490
The Penta-sect

295
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,000
never regarded the Kunlun Mountains

296
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:27,470
as its own property.

297
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:30,410
The Kunlun Mountains

298
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:33,260
which belongs to ordinary people should be used on ordinary people.

299
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:35,070
So,

300
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,460
I've decided

301
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,610
to finish this thing

302
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:42,000
for my father and the ancestors of the Penta-sect.

303
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:48,590
You have a kind heart.

304
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,320
But

305
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:53,260
I need your help.

306
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,400
To be honest,

307
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,090
I've been to the Mountain-Moving headquarters.

308
00:15:59,510 --> 00:16:00,270
But

309
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,330
I didn't find the soul pursuit order.

310
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:33,910
This

311
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:38,450
is the soul pursuit order of the mountain-moving.

312
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,690
The old wretch down the mountain

313
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:46,380
has been looking for it for more than 20 years.

314
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,430
In the end,

315
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,670
he didn't get it.

316
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,800
Today,

317
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:10,619
I give it to you.

318
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:31,450
Thank you, Ma'am.

319
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,310
Ma'am.

320
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,950
Who else wants your soul pursuit order?

321
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,900
Is the old wretch you mentioned

322
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,920
my master Zhou Qiuhai?

323
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,820
Who else could it be?

324
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,220
He locked me in this place

325
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:57,660
for 20 years.

326
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,430
20 years.

327
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,080
He wants

328
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,240
to drive me crazy.

329
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:10,930
But...

330
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,900
But why did my master lock you in?

331
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,810
Why?

332
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,080
Because he is greedy.

333
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,530
As a member of the Penta-sect,

334
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:27,390
he covets the Kunlun Mountains.

335
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,300
He wants to get the Kunlun Mountains.

336
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,800
A man whose heart is not content is like a snake that tries to swallow an elephant.

337
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:39,870
Even if I have to risk my life,

338
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,100
I won't let him succeed.

339
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,810
That's impossible.

340
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,320
You must have misunderstood my master.

341
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,890
You

342
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,690
must be deceived

343
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,890
by Zhou Qiuhai.

344
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,540
Back then,

345
00:19:02,290 --> 00:19:04,790
I trusted him so deeply

346
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,880
that I ended up like this.

347
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,080
Zhou Qiuhai

348
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,610
is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

349
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,960
I don't know whether Shou Wujiang who's from the Gold Touching Sect

350
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,910
was harmed by him.

351
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:33,750
Ma'am.

352
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,030
Not long ago,

353
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,580
we met Sect Leader Shou

354
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,140
in the Dengkun Pavilion,

355
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:44,880
but...

356
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,160
What happened to him?

357
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,430
Sect Leader Shou

358
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,530
has passed away.

359
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,060
He left a letter written in blood,

360
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:58,360
saying that the murderer

361
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,250
is Tian Long.

362
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,400
Tian Long.

363
00:20:08,110 --> 00:20:09,320
Tian Long.

364
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,130
Tian Long!

365
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,260
This is my fate.

366
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,650
This is my fate.

367
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,380
Ma'am.

368
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,020
Is Tian Long

369
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:40,740
Zhou Qiuhai?

370
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:45,950
Ma'am.

371
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,770
Ma'am.

372
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:52,940
Tian Long.

373
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,200
You really dare to come.

374
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:54,990
Brothers.

375
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,460
Kill him to avenge the Old Sect Leader's death.

376
00:21:56,590 --> 00:21:57,300
Yes.

377
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,240
You know a lot.

378
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,460
I can kill Shou Wujiang.

379
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:02,930
I can kill you too.

380
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,320
But today,

381
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,520
I have no time to play with you.

382
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:07,790
Have at you.

383
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:13,220
Fire!

384
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,360
Fire!

385
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:19,860
Chase him!

386
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,700
Yunqi.

387
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,470
I don't believe that Master is Tian Long.

388
00:23:17,310 --> 00:23:18,070
And I don't believe

389
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,960
he would kill the members of the Penta-sect.

390
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,730
He thinks the rules of the Penta-sect are more important than his life.

391
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:25,210
He wouldn't do such a thing.

392
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:29,660
I know, Wu Shuang.

393
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,750
I understand

394
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,680
you don't want to believe it.

395
00:23:33,190 --> 00:23:34,530
Because Zhou Qiuhai is your master.

396
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,540
He's like your father.

397
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,770
But have you ever thought

398
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,660
what he looked like in front of you

399
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:42,220
might be what he was acting.

400
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,380
Acting?

401
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,460
I don't believe it.

402
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,150
I've been with Master for more than ten years.

403
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:55,950
He has always been upright and kind.

404
00:23:56,370 --> 00:23:57,760
He's good to all his disciples

405
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,520
and the people in the town.

406
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,450
No matter who is in trouble,

407
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:03,220
as long as they ask the Mound-Digging for help,

408
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,940
my master will do his best to help them.

409
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,280
He never passes the buck.

410
00:24:06,910 --> 00:24:09,110
Last year, the people in the town

411
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,480
wanted to build a shrine for him.

412
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,420
We disciples were very happy to hear it.

413
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,800
We all wanted to help.

414
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,490
But Master scolded us.

415
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,960
He said we blazed it a lot

416
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,510
and that we didn't think for the people.

417
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,320
He even went to the town personally

418
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,000
and asked them not to build a shrine for him.

419
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:24,300
He said

420
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,630
if they had money, they could buy fields,

421
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:27,830
let their children study

422
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,720
or do business with the Mound-Digging.

423
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,440
How could such a person

424
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:33,460
covet wealth

425
00:24:33,660 --> 00:24:35,260
and do such horrible things?

426
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:37,320
Maybe that's why

427
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,870
he hasn't been exposed for so many years.

428
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,390
Wu Shuang.

429
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,860
When we were in the underground palace,

430
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,290
did you feel there was something wrong?

431
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:46,580
What was wrong?

432
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:49,170
There were voice transmitters in the underground palace.

433
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:50,410
That means

434
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:51,850
your master was listening

435
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,950
to what happened in the underground palace.

436
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:58,030
He wanted to know

437
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:59,540
our situations in the underground palace.

438
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:00,880
It's normal.

439
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,190
How could he ensure our safety

440
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,540
and let us out otherwise?

441
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,260
Listen to me.

442
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,240
If I'm not mistaken,

443
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,720
the underground palace in the Mound-Digging

444
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,910
was built by imitating the Kunlun Mountains.

445
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,960
No one can break it except the Ding family.

446
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,560
Your master's purpose

447
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,150
is to learn

448
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,110
how to open the Kunlun Mountains from me.

449
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,430
Also,

450
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:23,980
your master

451
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,750
never wanted

452
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:27,220
to give me the soul pursuit order of the Mound-Digging.

453
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,000
No.

454
00:25:33,430 --> 00:25:33,890
Let's go.

455
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,030
Leave here immediately.

456
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:36,830
Why?

457
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:38,930
Your master must know

458
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,400
Lao Beifeng's physical condition.

459
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,380
He was afraid that if Lao Beifeng died,

460
00:25:43,170 --> 00:25:43,760
he would never know the whereabouts

461
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:45,320
of the soul pursuit order of the Mountain-Moving.

462
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,290
So he set up a trap

463
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,810
and lured me to the Mound-Digging Region.

464
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,410
He knew the Mountain-Moving's loyalty to Heavenly Official.

465
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,460
He used me to get the soul chasing order.

466
00:25:55,190 --> 00:25:56,190
Then he'll force me

467
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:57,920
or kill me.

468
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,340
In this way, he will have

469
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,020
two soul pursuit orders.

470
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,150
Kill you?

471
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,720
Yes.

472
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:12,320
Brother and Fengling must be in danger now.

473
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:14,550
I wonder how they are.

474
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:19,800
Yunqi.

475
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,650
I don't understand.

476
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:23,280
I don't understand

477
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:24,920
why things became like this.

478
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,200
There's no time

479
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:29,710
to make it clear.

480
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,470
If I die,

481
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,790
protect yourself.

482
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,220
Also,

483
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,820
protect these two soul pursuit orders.

484
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:51,420
Don't mention it to anyone.

485
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:54,830
I hope your master has a conscience

486
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:56,380
and don't make things difficult for you.

487
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,650
Why did things become like this?

488
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:08,470
Promise first.

489
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,690
OK.

490
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,660
I promise.

491
00:27:18,930 --> 00:27:19,600
Let's go.

492
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,290
Senior.

493
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,870
Many people are coming in.

494
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:44,090
Let's go.

495
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,180
-Hurry up! -Go!

496
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,430
How dare you come here?

497
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,030
You've already made a scene here this morning

498
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,120
and hurt many of the disciples.

499
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,420
You come back before it gets dark.

500
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,470
What do you take the Mound-Digging for?

501
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,250
Hua Xingchen.

502
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:03,620
We're not here to make trouble.

503
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,220
We just saw Tian Long

504
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,870
running into your Mound-Digging headquarters.

505
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,820
[Mound-Digging Headquarters]

506
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:09,600
We're here only for Tian Long.

507
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,930
Please do us a favor.

508
00:28:11,050 --> 00:28:11,980
Tian Long?

509
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:13,240
No one is called Tian Long in the Mound-Digging.

510
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,170
Hua Xingchen, don't be so arrogant.

511
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,560
Tian Long killed our Old Sect Leader.

512
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:19,370
He's our sworn enemy.

513
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,640
If the Mound-Digging can catch that person

514
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,520
with us,

515
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,740
we Gold Touching men

516
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,210
will remember your kindness.

517
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,730
