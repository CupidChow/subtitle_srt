4
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,860
I do treat you like a child.

5
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,860
If I didn't treat you as a child,

6
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:50,000
today,

7
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,310
you couldn't walk out of this door.

8
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,610
Don't move! Put your guns down!

9
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,070
-Don't move! -Don't move!

-Don't move! -Don't move!

-I'm asking you to put your guns down. -Do you hear me?

-Don't move! -Don't move!

16

This...

17
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,579
You served a main course.

18
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:36,780
I thought you like strong flavors.

19
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:40,190
I...

20
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:43,210
I like bland food. You...

21
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
No, this...

22
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:47,200
Well...

23
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,930
Let's talk. Don't ruin our friendship.

24
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:52,060
What are you doing? Put your guns down!

25
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,840
What are you doing? Behave yourself.

26
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,360
Don't scare my sister.

27
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,160
Wait for me outside.

28
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:59,380
I'll...

29
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:01,310
I'll be out in a minute. Leave here.

30
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,790
It's really...

31
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,540
It made me nervous.

32
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:35,880
Master Tian.

33
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,940
What problems

34
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,450
need 30 little yellow croakers to solve?

35
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,110
Sister.

36
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,340
It's not a big problem.

37
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,550
It's just...

38
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,850
It's just...

39
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:51,420
A fortune.

40
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,530
Tell me.

41
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,560
Opium.

42
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:04,100
Master Tian.

43
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,910
You scared me.

44
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:07,590
Opium

45
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,190
is being kept in check by the government.

46
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,260
If I remember correctly,

47
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,720
your brother

48
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,780
has been investigating this matter.

49
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,310
Are you here

50
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:21,910
to sound me out?

51
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:24,470
Sister.

52
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,120
If I really wanted to give you a hard time,

53
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,760
you know where you would be sent to

54
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,810
for the rest of your life

55
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,340
because of those customers

56
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:34,260
and guns.

57
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,780
Master Tian, you scared me again.

58
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,170
The customers here

59
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:41,610
are from all over the world.

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,920
What they did before

61
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,770
has nothing to do with me.

62
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,010
But people who are related to opium

63
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,560
will be sentenced to death.

64
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,880
As the saying goes,

65
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:04,030
nothing ventured, nothing gained.

66
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,840
Whether being sentenced to death or not,

67
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,180
it depends on the person

68
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,700
who has power.

69
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,370
I know.

70
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,960
You're

71
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,380
that person.

72
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,750
Tell me.

73
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,440
Should I be careful

74
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,030
with the opium deal?

75
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,590
Of course.

76
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,370
I don't think I have enough people.

77
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,220
But I think your people

78
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,530
are tough. Can I borrow them?

79
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:40,360
It's no big deal.

80
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,830
It's easy.

81
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,390
Fine.

82
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,840
When will you need them?

83
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:46,370
Two days later.

84
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:47,590
No problem.

85
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:50,530
I have to make it clear.

86
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:52,500
You have to tell your brothers.

87
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,630
When that day comes,

88
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,270
I'll be their boss.

89
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,080
Not just that day.

90
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,050
You'll always be

91
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,870
their boss.

92
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,500
Sister.

93
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:24,760
Let me tell you.

94
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,770
Although I'm lame,

95
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:28,100
I know everything well.

96
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,330
Well...

97
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,850
Would you do me the honor

98
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,580
of dancing with me?

99
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,690
So fair.

100
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:51,800
This...

101
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,700
This brat

102
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,760
is really greedy.

103
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:00,990
He couldn't find money,

104
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,400
so he came to find people.

105
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,660
So he had

106
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:07,390
neither money nor people.

107
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:11,290
He wanted to trade nothing for opium?

108
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,870
How inhumane!

109
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,630
I like it.

Luo Yunsong.

111
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:23,090
He isn't like your brother.

112
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,450
He's like my brother.

113
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,260
Okay.

114
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,290
Since he came in person,

115
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,320
I'll accept everything.

116
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,440
Agree to all his conditions.

00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,450
Commander,

118
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:45,060
it's easy for you to say.

119
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,340
How can I agree to his conditions?

120
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,880
My people

121
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:51,110
are busy looking after my place.

122
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,530
How about this?

123
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:55,430
You send some men to help me.

124
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,450
So you're trading nothing for my people too?

125
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,850
I don't have people.

126
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,110
Okay.

127
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:09,460
I like it.

128
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,120
I like trading with you like this.

[Freight Dock]

130
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:54,940
You came here alone?

131
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,880
Yes.

132
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,350
You're not afraid?

133
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,150
No.

134
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,040
If you wanted me to die, you would have killed me earlier.

135
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,570
Since you don't want to kill me,

136
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:07,630
you don't have to keep reminding me

137
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,690
that you can kill me anytime.

A commanding police director

may be killed at any time.

140

Do you suddenly feel

141
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,720
your life is a failure?

142
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,570
Many people want me to die?

143
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,340
I don't know how many people there were before.

144
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,140
But now there's one more person.

145
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,880
Why didn't I know?

146
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,780
Director Luo.

147
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:33,670
It's rare for you to be so stupid.

148
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:36,990
Tell me then.

149
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,160
Besides you,

150
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,720
who else wants me to die so badly?

151
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:44,970
To be exact, so far,

152
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,830
I haven't wanted you to die.

153
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,410
But this person

154
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,570
insists on letting you die.

155
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,280
He even picked a date for you.

156
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,730
It sounds so creepy.

157
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,430
Is it the King of Hell?

158
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,540
Almost.

159
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,760
You can call him the King of Hell

160
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,900
or Commander Hu.

161
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,870
It's the same.

162
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,710
You

163
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,400
attracted him here.

164
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,370
I've told you.

165
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,630
I don't want you to die.

166
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,190
He was attracted

167
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,110
by the treasure

168
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,170
that may not exist.

169
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,070
The treasure may not exist.

170
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,380
But I may die for them.

171
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:35,490
How unfair!

172
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,420
You want to help me, right?

173
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,760
I want to get the dragon bone back.

174
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,300
If I died,

175
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:00,730
I couldn't return the dragon bone to you.

176
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,740
So you have to help me.

177
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,930
It seems that you know your situation well.

178
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:12,190
From the moment Commander Hu entered my house,

179
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,920
I knew it.

180
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:20,830
What do you want to do?

181
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:26,800
What do you want me to do?

182
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,400
Do you really think

183
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,460
Luo Yunsong will cooperate with you?

184
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,120
He has led an army and fought wars.

185
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:38,490
Of course he can see

186
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,130
the situation.

187
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,320
With the current situation,

188
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,680
not to mention the director of the police department,

189
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,390
even if he had thousands of people,

190
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,170
he could do nothing

191
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,320
but obey.

192
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:55,010
What if he doesn't listen to you?

193
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,850
Isn't that easier?

194
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,660
We can send someone

195
00:11:59,910 --> 00:12:01,590
to kill him.

196
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,580
Commander, we're talking about making money.

197
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:07,930
Can we stop talking about death?

198
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,150
It's scary.

199
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,390
Yanzhi, there's a saying that

200
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:15,790
get rich or die.

201
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,760
It has been mentioned in the saying.

202
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,930
You can only choose between life and money.

203
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,930
Which one do you want?

204
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,940
Of course I'll choose life.

205
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,110
We can choose both of them.

206
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,480
Keep the money.

207
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:36,610
He can sacrifice his life.

208
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,000
Isn't it perfect?

209
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,440
No.

210
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,200
Can we do it in this way?

211
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,720
I'll do it like this.

212
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,160
I've always been doing this.

213
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,680
I never put a foot wrong.

214
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:00,620
You mean there's a bigger tomb

215
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:02,820
under that tomb?

216
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,310
There's a high possibility.

217
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,130
According to what you said,

218
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:11,120
as long as we don't touch that bigger tomb,

219
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:13,000
the treasure there won't be found

220
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,590
and Commander Hu won't kill me.

221
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,060
Director Luo,

222
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,330
your life isn't that worthless.

223
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,720
As long as they can't find the treasure,

224
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,940
Commander Hu

225
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,000
won't go too far because of

226
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:27,150
your or Chu Fengling's identity.

227
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,580
Tell me the truth.

228
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,000
Is the tomb under that fake tomb

229
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:36,170
the Kunlun Mountains?

230
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:44,910
I thought you were a sensible person.

231
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:47,570
I didn't expect you to ask such a silly question.

232
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,080
Your analysis is so accurate.

233
00:13:52,550 --> 00:13:55,070
Your plan is so detailed, so...

234
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,680
No one can do it

235
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,280
except you.

236
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,710
So?

237
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,590
So I believe it slightly.

238
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:07,940
What?

239
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,670
Before,

240
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,780
I didn't believe there was the Kunlun Mountains.

241
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,470
You help me in order to get back the dragon bone.

242
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,870
No matter how you help me, I can understand.

243
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,750
But you're doing your best

244
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:24,300
to help me get through this.

245
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,660
There seems to be only one explanation.

246
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,970
The Kunlun Mountains

247
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,750
really exist in this world.

248
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:34,430
Am I right?

249
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:45,010
I saw a few problems just now.

250
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,020
Firstly, Luo Yunsong,

251
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,580
you are a fool.

252
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:53,160
Even if the Kunlun Mountains really existed in this world,

253
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,790
they won't be found so easily.

254
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,640
Secondly, you're

255
00:14:56,890 --> 00:14:57,940
a rat.

256
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,910
You don't believe there are upright men in this world.

257
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,860
Don't you think you're pitiful?

258
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,550
Whether I'm a rat

259
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:06,930
or fool,

260
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,780
even if I'm pitiful,

261
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,290
I'm still a person.

262
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:13,230
A

263
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:15,330
living person.

264
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,760
Remember to return my dragon bone.

265
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:26,670
Once the Small Kunlun is opened, I will return it to you.

266
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:27,740
You won't cheat me this time?

267
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,260
No.

268
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,960
But it's a different matter.

269
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,340
Even if I returned the dragon bone,

270
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,070
I would still find your father.

271
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,740
It seems that there's a sentence I haven't said.

272
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,510
You're also a stubborn person.

273
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:44,820
Ding Yunqi.

274
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,650
Thank you.

275
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,310
Can it work?

276
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,240
Probably.

277
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,730
But I feel bad about keeping it

278
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:28,160
from Fengling.

279
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,220
What's wrong?

280
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,740
When you found there might be a fake tomb,

281
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,210
you didn't tell her either.

282
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:35,380
That's different.

283
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,400
At that time,

284
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:40,530
I thought the Kunlun Mountains were under the fake tomb.

285
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,060
Now it's not the Kunlun Mountains.

286
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,000
It might be their tombs.

287
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,310
You're keeping it from her for her own good.

288
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,450
Otherwise, according to her personality,

289
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,380
she might really sacrifice her life for the country.

290
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,460
Fine.

291
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,640
I won't tell her for now.

292
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:07,680
Also,

293
00:17:07,930 --> 00:17:09,650
you need to go to the Small Kunlun again.

294
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,630
Find the burial chamber of the fake tomb.

295
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:12,550
Don't open

296
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,010
the real chamber that day.

297
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,410
What are you talking about?

298
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,450
How could you say that?

299
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:22,880
You brought disgrace on the Ding family.

300
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,270
What do you mean?

301
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:25,869
Do you think they're at different floors

302
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:27,460
with a ceiling between them?

303
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:29,600
There are at least 30 feet between them.

304
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,820
Besides, it's protected

305
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,170
by a layer of dust.

306
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,140
It can't be dug

307
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,650
with either spades or pickaxes.

308
00:17:35,650 --> 00:17:36,910
How could you say that?

309
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,840
In case I accidentally dig it out?

310
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:39,890
If it were that easy,

311
00:17:39,890 --> 00:17:41,690
the Penta-sect wouldn't exist.

312
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:45,020
Fine. You are the best.

313
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,950
It's good that you can't dig it out.

314
00:17:50,650 --> 00:17:51,490
Let me ask you.

315
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,010
After the matter of the Small Kunlun is over,

316
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,530
will Luo Yunsong return the dragon bone?

317
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,010
Judging by his look today,

318
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,450
it's not perfunctory.

319
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:05,140
If he returns the dragon bone,

320
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,320
is it because of me

321
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,870
or you?

322
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,960
What's the difference?

323
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,730
There's a big difference.

324
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,500
I lost the dragon bone.

325
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:16,600
Of course it's your contribution.

326
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:18,870
Didn't Luo Yunsong make it clear?

327
00:18:18,870 --> 00:18:20,470
If you help Chu Fengling open the Small Kunlun,

328
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,140
he'll return the dragon bone.

329
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:22,670
So it's your contribution.

330
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,130
It's a deal.

331
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,570
I have to go with you when Luo Yunsong returns the dragon bone.

332
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,380
Then he can hand the dragon bone to me.

333
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,470
Then...

334
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:32,430
You'll hand it to me.

335
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:33,270
No.

336
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,630
It's not me who'll hand it to you.

337
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:37,850
It's you who'll ask me to return it to you.

338
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,780
Are you still...

339
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,370
I didn't say anything.

340
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:41,570
I mentioned nothing.

341
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:44,360
You have to give it to me

342
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,020
before you get it back from me.

343
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:49,280
Fine. Anyway,

344
00:18:49,950 --> 00:18:50,870
you can do anything.

345
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,670
Just don't mention that matter.

346
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:54,990
Ding Yunqi.

347
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:56,040
Sometimes,

348
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,680
I really hate you.

349
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,490
You're really rootless.

350
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:27,750
You're

351
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,130
elusive.

352
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,320
I don't dare to be elusive.

353
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:34,130
But I'm really rootless.

354
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,650
People in the martial artists community

355
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:38,380
are like leaves without roots.

356
00:19:39,210 --> 00:19:41,270
We flutter in the breeze.

357
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,050
We don't care where we'll fall.

358
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:45,810
When I can't flutter,

359
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,410
I'll find a stable home

360
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,410
and stay there quietly.

361
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,200
Is it hard

362
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,540
to be quiet?

363
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:13,570
[South Ferry]

364
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,030
After a long time,

365
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:11,320
you'll understand sometimes we have no choice.

366
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,360
Because once you understand,

367
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,040
you've already paid the price.

368
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,210
Sister, why are you here?

369
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:36,610
Can't I come and see my brother when I'm available?

370
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:42,420
I've never asked you

371
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,190
why you

372
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:46,290
came to Shanghai.

373
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,210
To find my father.

374
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,490
Did you find him?

375
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,450
He might not be in Shanghai.

376
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,090
You have news about my father?

377
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,350
I mean

378
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:06,880
if you can't find him in Shanghai,

379
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,170
have you ever thought about

380
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:09,430
going somewhere else?

381
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:18,290
There's no clue.

382
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,630
I don't know where to find my father.

383
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:23,620
Besides,

384
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,350
I still have a lot of things to do in Shanghai.

385
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:27,240
I can't leave.

386
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,430
Back then,

387
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,000
King You of Zhou lit warning beacons to fool his dukes and princes.

388
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,350
In his eyes,

389
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,200
nothing is more important

390
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,800
than the smile of the beauty.

391
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,290
But when we look back,

392
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:52,440
nothing mattered.

393
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:56,720
There's nothing you can't let go.

394
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,740
If you can't let go,

395
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,820
it shouldn't be a problem

396
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,780
but people.

397
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:12,050
Well...

398
00:22:12,430 --> 00:22:13,220
No.

399
00:22:13,770 --> 00:22:14,950
It doesn't matter.

400
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,100
Take her

401
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:20,110
to go with you.

402
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:23,350
Sister.

403
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:24,400
You...

404
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,330
There's no youth in the martial artists' community.

405
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:31,070
Isn't it good to stay away from those disputes?

406
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:37,300
Commander Hu is looking for me?

407
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,030
How do you know?

408
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,310
Brother sent someone to keep an eye on the club.

409
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:47,620
Every time you went to see Commander Hu,

410
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,470
I knew it immediately.

411
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,500
But I didn't receive any news

412
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,590
before Uncle Jiu came to see me.

413
00:22:56,060 --> 00:22:56,900
It means

414
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,910
you've already found out Brother's people.

415
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:01,900
You just wanted me to know

416
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,920
what you wanted me to know.

417
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:07,780
I've told you.

418
00:23:08,710 --> 00:23:09,970
You're smart.

419
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:12,660
You asked me to leave Shanghai.

420
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:16,010
In Shanghai, only Commander Hu

421
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,360
can threaten me.

422
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,040
So I guess

423
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:21,100
Commander Hu

424
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,360
wants something from me.

425
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,150
Will you leave or not?

426
00:23:25,420 --> 00:23:26,220
I won't leave.

427
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,000
When Luo Yunsong revealed the dragon bone in newspapers,

428
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,260
I knew there would be

429
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,230
more troubles.

430
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,030
I knew you wouldn't leave.

431
00:23:40,330 --> 00:23:41,260
Why bother?

432
00:23:42,310 --> 00:23:44,370
Isn't it good to live a peaceful life?

433
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,050
That's good.

434
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,480
But

435
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:50,290
I can't endure it.

436
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:53,230
Fame can't be exchanged for this life either.

437
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:55,290
I really want to live a peaceful life.

438
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:57,680
But I must first find my father

439
00:23:58,310 --> 00:23:59,440
and clear his name.

440
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,960
I can't live a good life

441
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,770
with this charge.

442
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,410
I can't get away even if I want to.

443
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,130
You're

444
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,980
a young hero.

445
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:16,410
You're fearless.

446
00:24:18,970 --> 00:24:19,810
Thank you.

447
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:21,940
Why are you thanking me?

448
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,720
I didn't help you much.

449
00:24:25,650 --> 00:24:27,450
I'll stall Commander Hu for now.

450
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,310
I'll try not to let you two meet first.

451
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:32,960
He wants to see you because he wants you

452
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,300
to help him find the Kunlun Mountains.

453
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,770
These people are crazy.

454
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,820
In this world,

455
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,470
it's hard not to go crazy.

456
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:00,930
Master Tian.

457
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:03,040
Have you prepared the payment?

458
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,870
You...

459
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,250
It took the bait.

460
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:11,720
I got one.

461
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,280
Hurry up.

462
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,830
Take it.

463
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,720
I confiscated them.

464
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:18,190
Pick one.

465
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,260
Come on.

466
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,480
Pick one.

467
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:24,950
Master Tian.

468
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:29,400
Come on.

469
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,580
Pick one.

470
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:32,130
Master Tian.

471
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,560
If you don't have

472
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,280
enough money recently,

473
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,630
I can tell the superiors

474
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,400
that we don't need the goods.

475
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,070
What do you mean?

476
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:43,350
When did I lack money?

477
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:45,810
Deliver the goods on time tomorrow.

478
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,220
OK.

479
00:25:48,550 --> 00:25:49,270
No problem.

480
00:25:49,910 --> 00:25:51,280
Then the payment...

481
00:25:52,830 --> 00:25:53,850
I haven't got

482
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,440
the goods yet.

483
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,750
I'll give you the money when I get the goods.

484
00:25:57,750 --> 00:25:59,750
I have to see the goods first, right?

485
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,070
Right.

486
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,040
I called you here

487
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:06,150
because I prepared a gift for you.

488
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:07,580
What are you doing?

489
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,050
Why are you panicking?

490
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,900
This is for you. Take it.

491
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,080
You're doing

492
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:15,010
a dangerous job.

493
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,020
Right?

494
00:26:16,230 --> 00:26:17,580
When you're in Shanghai,

495
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,630
I can protect you.

496
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,390
Even flies can't approach you.

497
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:21,650
If you leave Shanghai,

498
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,410
I can't help you.

499
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,600
Keep this to keep you safe.

500
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,580
I hope you won't need it for the rest of your life, okay?

501
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,290
Take it.

502
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,590
Thank you, Master Tian.

503
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,820
Consider it as the deposit.

504
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,660
No way.

505
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:34,880
Take it.

506
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,790
Master Tian.

507
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,050
I think

508
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:47,880
you're a good person.

509
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:50,920
What do you mean?

510
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,140
I don't need you to think.

511
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,160
I'm a good person, okay?

512
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:57,640
Tomorrow afternoon.

513
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,780
Two o'clock.

514
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:00,000
Dock.

515
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,640
Make a deal on time.

516
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:02,940
Okay.

517
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,990
I'll wait for you at the dock tomorrow.

518
00:27:30,450 --> 00:27:31,290
Sir,

519
00:27:31,290 --> 00:27:32,750
what would you like to eat?

520
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,740
Claypot Rice. I want to get it to go.

521
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:39,260
[Noodles]

522
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:37,920
Okay, wait a moment.

523
00:27:40,150 --> 00:27:40,690
Here.

524
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,780
Be careful.

525
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:44,850
This is yours.

526
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,100
Sir, this...

527
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,790
That's too much. We don't have much change.

528
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,720
No need. Keep the rest.

529
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,570
Tell your master

530
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:57,790
that I want to see him here

531
00:27:57,790 --> 00:27:58,790
tomorrow.

532
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,360
My master?

533
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,230
Are you talking about our boss?

534
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,360
Young master,

535
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,510
I'm here every day.

536
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:12,570
Just let me know if you need anything.

537
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,430
This silver coin is...

538
00:28:17,270 --> 00:28:18,160
This...

539
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,990
Get back to work.

540
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:23,740
Okay.

541
00:28:26,770 --> 00:28:27,480
So,

542
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,410
you went to the Small Kunlun again?

543
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,270
I thought I could see clearly

544
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:33,530
in peace.

545
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:34,750
As you know,

546
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,640
I don't have much practical experience.

547
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
Since my master's generation,

548
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,080
they haven't entered burial chambers often.

549
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:43,140
In my generation, we only have theoretical knowledge.

550
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:44,320
So,

551
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,350
I have to see it more carefully.

552
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:52,970
Sister, you can do it.

553
00:28:53,350 --> 00:28:54,490
You are the best expert

554
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,830
I can find.

555
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,430
Whatever you can do,

556
00:28:57,430 --> 00:28:58,430
I can accept it.

557
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,930
It'll be my best result.

558
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:01,210
Don't...

559
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,340
I found it.

560
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:03,810
Really?

561
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,280
I knew you could do it.

562
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,250
Come here. Sit down.

563
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,210
Tell me.

564
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:12,680
The feng shui of the Small Kunlun is not bad.

565
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,810
But according to the layout,

566
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:17,120
it's not a valuable place.

567
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,060
So even if there was a tomb inside,

568
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,120
it wouldn't be a very important tomb.

569
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,230
Just like the tomb we saw before.

570
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,200
According to the layer of dust,

571
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,220
I think it was built in the Eastern Han Dynasty

572
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,690
or earlier.

573
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,540
The scale is not large,

574
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:33,250
so

575
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,940
there won't be anything important inside.

576
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:38,370
Are you sure?

577
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:42,030
We've measured the layer of dust again.

578
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,750
It's not a large area,

579
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:44,590
so at most

580
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:46,190
it's just a tomb of a petty official of the Han Dynasty.

581
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,870
It can't be the Kunlun Mountains.

582
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,290
You just said 'we'.

583
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,480
Yunqi went with me.

584
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,460
Yunqi went there too?

585
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,520
I dragged him there.

586
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,120
What a pity!

587
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,350
He didn't learn from his father.

588
00:30:01,350 --> 00:30:03,150
He reminded me of many key points

589
00:30:03,150 --> 00:30:04,410
that I didn't realize.

590
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,610
What we can confirm now

591
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:10,800
is the location of the main burial chamber.

592
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:11,720
I guess

593
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,570
I can open all of them

594
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,180
within two or four hours.

595
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,730
Two or four hours? So soon.

596
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:20,750
Of course. We're doing it for the government.

597
00:30:20,750 --> 00:30:22,520
It's not a tomb raid.

598
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:24,990
If we open it in public,

599
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,850
it'll only take two or four hours.

600
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,900
It would be great if it was the Kunlun Mountains.

601
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:55,070
[Zhu's]

602
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,840
Waiter, I'd like a bowl of Yangchun noodles.

603
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,370
OK.

604
00:31:00,230 --> 00:31:00,990
Uncle.

605
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:02,630
If you add too much vinegar,

606
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,690
the original fragrance will be gone.

607
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,090
Original things don't matter.

608
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,050
What matters is

609
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:13,590
what you want.

610
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:15,100
That matters.

611
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,030
What's the matter?

612
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,330
Chu Fengling

613
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:26,000
wants to open the tomb of the Small Kunlun.

614
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:31,140
Wu Shuang promised to help her explore the way.

615
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,360
As her master,

616
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,680
you're really composed.

617
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,690
Yes. It seems

618
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:44,720
that you already knew about this.

619
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,560
You found that the explosives

620
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,290
were from the Songjiang Army.

621
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:51,090
Commander Hu

622
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:52,950
has joined the Small Kunlun team.

623
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,410
What will happen next?

624
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,970
I know you know it well.

625
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,370
That's good.

626
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,140
Dogs bite dogs.

627
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,720
Whether Luo Yunsong or he is hurt,

628
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,020
that will be great.

629
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,740
Yes. It'll be great.

630
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,890
But don't you think it's dangerous to stand around

631
00:32:12,890 --> 00:32:14,690
and watch the two mad dogs fight?

632
00:32:16,170 --> 00:32:17,170
I'm afraid

633
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:18,990
you won't be able

634
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,200
to avoid them.

635
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,850
What do you think?

636
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,410
Take Wu Shuang away from Shanghai.

637
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,260
No matter who wins,

638
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,700
they'll continue to do whatever they want.

639
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:35,110
[Zhu's]

640
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,880
Ordinary people don't fight with officials.

641
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,070
I think you know that very well.

642
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:39,850
Yunqi.

643
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,310
I came all the way to Shanghai.

644
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:45,970
I haven't finished my job yet.

645
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,970
How could you persuade me

646
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:50,400
with just a few words?

647
00:32:53,630 --> 00:32:54,890
You're right.

648
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,840
Your analysis is reasonable.

649
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,040
But

650
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:00,430
I won't leave.

651
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,330
And I won't put Wu Shuang in danger.

652
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,150
After all, everyone has

653
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,920
an important thing to do.

654
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,470
Danger?

655
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,160
I've never been afraid of it.

656
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,030
It seems that I need to

657
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,370
remind you.

658
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:22,070
How did Luo Yunsong

659
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,870
get the dragon bone?

660
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,310
I can't

661
00:33:28,070 --> 00:33:29,290
handle him alone.

662
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:30,880
Now Commander Hu is here.

663
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,140
Uncle.

664
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:34,450
I really don't believe

665
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:35,800
you and Wu Shuang

666
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,310
can be safe at that time.

667
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:40,420
Anyway,

668
00:33:41,630 --> 00:33:43,960
I don't want any more accidents to happen.

669
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,720
I've told you everything.

670
00:33:49,490 --> 00:33:51,380
How to be safe?

671
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:53,870
I think you know it better than me.

672
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:56,750
Waiter.

673
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:58,100
Bill, please.

674
00:33:58,690 --> 00:33:59,570
I'm coming.

675
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,060
This bowl of wontons is also on me.

676
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:07,340
[Zhu's]

677
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,449
Although you ate wontons

678
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,500
and I ate noodles,

679
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:14,770
for outsiders,

680
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,550
we're still eating on the same table.

681
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:33,000
[Zhu's]

682
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,190
Director.

683
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,969
What took you so long?

684
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:56,980
Is everything ready?

685
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,820
Yes.

686
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,880
How many people do we have?

687
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:00,680
20.

688
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,490
How many people?

689
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:03,990
20.

690
00:35:05,590 --> 00:35:06,720
Just 20 people?

691
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:08,950
The leader said

692
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,500

00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:43,690
Yes.

867
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:44,950
Besides the Black Feather Team,

868
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,410
how many people can we use?

869
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:49,910
There are eight people who took office

870
00:43:49,910 --> 00:43:51,770
at the Police Department with us.

871
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,850
Another four people

872
00:43:52,850 --> 00:43:54,910
have been in the army and fought wars.

873
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,250
If we have to fight,

874
00:43:56,630 --> 00:43:58,520
they can help.

875
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,960
The Black Feather Team

876
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:04,150
is only suitable for ambush.

877
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:05,830
The team members can't attack from afar.

878
00:44:05,830 --> 00:44:07,090
At the critical moment,

879
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:08,220
catch the leader first.

880
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,420
Catch Fatty Hu first.

881
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:10,490
Got it.

882
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,970
How many weapons

883
00:44:13,090 --> 00:44:14,310
do we have?

884
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:16,620
One light machine gun.

885
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:17,710
Ten Mosin-Nagant.

886
00:44:18,850 --> 00:44:20,380
The rest are Mauser rifles.

887
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,910
Split people into groups of four.

888
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,410
Tomorrow.

889
00:44:28,170 --> 00:44:30,100
The machine gun will be over there.

890
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,800
Crossfire will be there.

891
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:32,930
The control point.

892
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:34,850
Fatty Hu and I

893
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:35,940
will be there.

894
00:44:36,230 --> 00:44:37,450
You'll be there too.

895
00:44:37,450 --> 00:44:38,380
I have no choice.

896
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:41,180
If I didn't take a risk, we couldn't catch Fatty Hu.

897
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,240
Also,

898
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:43,960
let Master Tuo's 20 brothers

899
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,180
pose as people who help in opening the tomb.

900
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,310
Once we take action,

901
00:44:46,520 --> 00:44:47,490
they can stall

902
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,710
Fatty Hu's people.

903
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,810
We and the Black feather team can have a few more minutes.

904
00:44:50,810 --> 00:44:51,940
That will be enough.

905
00:44:52,490 --> 00:44:53,660
Okay, I got it.

906
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:54,970
I'll arrange it tonight

907
00:44:54,970 --> 00:44:56,100
and hide in advance.

908
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,710
I hope...

909
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:02,650
I hope we don't need them tomorrow.

911
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:50,820
Where are the goods?

912
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,280
Don't worry, Master Tian.

913
00:45:53,130 --> 00:45:54,230
We're changing the boat to a smaller one.

914
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:56,160
They'll be transported in groups.

915
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:00,860
The small boat is good.

916

The small boat is good.

917
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:04,180
Your brothers are on the boat?

918
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,410
Well...

919
00:46:06,570 --> 00:46:07,970
Let them rest on the boat.

920
00:46:08,130 --> 00:46:09,010
Well...

921
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:10,020
They've been on the boat for a long time.

922
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:11,780
They might even faint when they go ashore, right?

923
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,040
The small boat is safe.

924

I have people to help in unloading the goods anyway.

Fine.

926
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,740
Ask our people to unload the goods.

927
00:46:21,740 --> 00:46:24,090
I'll ask the boss to deliver the goods first.

928
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,050
Okay.

929
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:25,810
Go.

What are you waiting for?

931
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:38,220
Go and help in unloading the goods.

932
00:46:38,220 --> 00:46:39,320
Come on. Let's go.

933

Let's go.

How many boxes are left behind?

After this batch,

00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,530
there are about three boxes left.
