Welcome.

6
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,140
Master Jiu.

7
00:03:06,690 --> 00:03:07,440
This is

8
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:08,580
a stranger.

9
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,800
He just came here and sit on Kuigang Direction (an important position).

10
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm afraid he's here for some benefits.

Excuse me.

12
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,210
Would you please tell me

13

where you come from?

14
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,570
Sir, my family name is Ding.

15
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,010
I would like to see Ms. Cui Yanzhi.

16
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,290
Boy,

17
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,080
please have some tea.

18
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:26,900
Sir,

19
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,010
I don't know the rules of martial artists community.

20
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,150
I came here today

21
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,490
to ask Ms. Cui

22
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,000
something.

23
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,360
So,

24
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,640
you are not from the martial artists community?

25
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,310
No.

26
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,460
Why are you

27
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,900
asking something about it since you are not in it?

28
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:49,909
It just occurred.

29
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,890
Since I can't escape from it,

30
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:52,940
I will solve it.

31
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,180
That's a good point.

32
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:00,290
But with this alone

33
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,060
will not make you be admitted to see our boss.

34

Suit yourself.

36
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,440
What if I say

37
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,590
I'm the descendant of Ding, the Heaven Official family of Penta-sect?

38
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,450
Then it's different.

39
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,590
I am Ding Yunqi,

40
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,000
descendant of Ding, the Heaven Official family of Penta-sect.

41

I want to see your boss for something.

42
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,490
The Ding family is not in the martial artists community.

43
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,880
That will be funny to tell.

44
00:05:39,690 --> 00:05:40,870
The Ding family is the Ding family.

45
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:42,000
I don't care

46

How did you know this, sir?

50
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:01,230
I heard that this was the topic for Ding family's kids.

51
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,560
It has been rumored for a long time. I don't know if it's true.

52
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,270
Yes.

53
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,900
I almost forgot if you didn't say it.

54
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,460
After you said it just now,

55
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,450
I replied it subconsciously.

56
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,940
Judging from your manner,

57
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,020
you are indeed from the Ding family.

58
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,260
Please forgive me

59
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,360
for my rudeness, young master.

60
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:25,970
Sir,

61
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,470
I still don't know

62
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,530
your name.

63
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,430
My family name is Zhu and is the ninth child.

64
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,030
You can call me Jiu (nine).

65
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,270
You are being too polite.

66
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:38,030
Please forgive my abruptness, Master Jiu.

67
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,830
No need to be so polite.

I will be straightforward.

Can I see your boss?

71
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:14,350

72
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,240
this is my boss.

73

Ding Yunqi from the Heaven Official Ding family.

If you had told me earlier he's such a handsome young man,

77
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,659
I would have seen him no matter who he is.

saying my father was the one who robbed the tomb.

138

139

It was opened by explosives.

But the explosives

145
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,180
were bought

146
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,310
from Mr. Cui.

147
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,600

the tomb

149
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,550
was opened by me?

150
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,530
Of course not.

151

How could you be that kind of person?

That's right.

who the buyer is,

156
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,320
I'm afraid you can't

157

escape from the charge of bombing the tomb.

Why did you sneak out?

176
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,010
I just... It's simple.

177
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,480
I can handle it myself.

178
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,330
I'm angry.

179
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,780
You did something behind my back.

180
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,470
Think about it.

181
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,470
What if something happened?

182
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,130
Like you said, I can just fight.

183
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,930
Isn't it good to have someone to help you?

184
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,870
I don't like fighting.

185
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:50,130
I was afraid if you were here, we had to fight.

186
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,380
Do I like fighting that much?

187
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,510
You don't like fighting.

188
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:56,190
You are just capable of good martial arts and always want to show it.

189
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:56,990
Well.

190
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,700
Stop being angry, okay?

191
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,830
I'll take you to drink soda.

192
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,950
You didn't have enough of it last time, right?

193
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,350
I'll take you to drink it.

194
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,540
I'm full due to anger.

195
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:06,560
I'm not drinking.

196
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,830
Really?

197
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,710
No.

198
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,780
Let's eat

199
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,760
the meat buns made by San Jin then.

200
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:15,600
No.

201
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:16,980
I want soda.

202
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,510
Two bottles.

203
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:19,480
Three bottles.

204
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:20,120
Let's go.

205
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:20,980
Four bottles.

206
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:21,860
Five bottles.

207
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:24,380
Wait for me.

208
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:30,130
[Garrison Headquarters]

209
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,930
♫Your words were too harsh♫

210
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:18,930
♫I feel uneasy as a wife♫

211
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,000
♫We are a couple♫

212
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,340
♫There is no difference between you and me♫

213
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:45,690
♫There's no such thing between couples♫

214
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,160
Commander.

215
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,590
This young girl is really nice.

216
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:01,220
Take a rest.

217
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:03,700
I'll listen to it later after I'm back.

218
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:05,550
Girl.

219
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,570
I'll be back soon.

220
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,400
Her Ladyship has given the order.

221
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,750
I'll be responsible for opening the Han tomb of Small Kunlun.

222
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:15,750
It's to be opened?

223
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,060
So quick.

224
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,410
Her Ladyship is always sharp.

225
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,620
How about it? Will you help me?

226
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:25,880
I can't.

227
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,430
Why?

228
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,460
Master doesn't allow us to open tombs.

229
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,250
And he said

230
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,770
the Penta-sect has quitted this business long ago.

231
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,290
If I help you secretly,

232
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:37,390
I'll be dead if he finds out.

233
00:16:39,990 --> 00:16:40,750
How about

234
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,760
you asking him?

235
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,110
To be honest,

236
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,160
if it were someone else,

237
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,520
my master might agree to help.

238
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,670
But it's related to Director Luo.

239
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,240
Most importantly,

240
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,830
your brother's reputation

241
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,220
is really bad.

242
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:02,710
I see.

243
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:04,890
Wu Shuang.

244
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,200
Ms. Wu Shuang.

245
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,589
I have a suggestion.

246
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,910
If you help Fengling,

247
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,140
I promise I'll return the dragon bone to Ding Yunqi

248
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:17,400
after the tomb of Small Kunlun is opened.

249
00:17:18,589 --> 00:17:20,940
You just said you would give it to me tomorrow.

250
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,740
What?

251
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,420
Dragon bone.

252
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:25,980
You always want the dragon bone.

253
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,040
What does the dragon bone mean to you?

254
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,550
Answer me.

255
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:36,690
For many people,

256
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,870
the dragon bone is the Penta-sect,

257
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,140
is Kunlun and is a treasure.

258
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,450
But to me, it is nothing.

259
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,090
The reason why I want to have the dragon bone

260
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,970
is simple.

261
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:49,060
Just for Ding Yuanshan.

262
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:51,850
But...

263
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,650
I know.

264
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,000
You think Ding Yuanshan never shows up

265
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,600
during all the time I have it.

266
00:17:57,270 --> 00:17:58,070
That's right.

267
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,160
But according to the current situation,

268
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,360
he might not show up for the dragon bone.

269
00:18:03,230 --> 00:18:05,630
And yet I still want to take the dragon bone.

270
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,780
Aren't you being a rogue?

271
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:12,410
You think I'm a rogue?

272
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:13,480
Then I'll be one.

273
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,910
It doesn't matter what you think of me.

274
00:18:15,910 --> 00:18:16,750
For me,

275
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,400
most importantly,

276
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,620
Ding Yuanshan may not care about the dragon bone,

277
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,950
but he will definitely care about his son.

278
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,620
According to you,

279
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,190
even if I help you open the Kunlun Mountains,

280
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:31,320
you won't return the dragon bone to me.

281
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,050
On the contrary.

282
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:36,370
Ding Yuanshan cares about Kunlun Mountains

283
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,670
and his son.

284
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,730
So if you help me open the Kunlun Mountains,

285
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:41,870
Ding Yuanshan will definitely show up.

286
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,930
I will be able to bring him to justice.

287
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,320
How many times have I told you

288
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,200
he was wronged?

289
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,630
Why don't you believe me?

290
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,520
He can tell us if he is wronged himself.

291
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:51,820
Isn't it more convincing?

292
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,540
I will give him a chance to prove his innocence.

293
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:54,590
Isn't it good?

294
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:57,930
Think about it.

295
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,480
Do you want to help Fengling?

296
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,820
If you help her, I'll return the dragon bone to you.

297
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,130
Fengling.

298
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:13,420
Can I believe the words of your bad brother?

299
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,930
I...

300
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,080
Ms. Wu Shuang, no.

301
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:22,820
Her Ladyship wants to open the Kunlun Mountains.

302
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:24,290
This is a big deal.

303
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,260
I'm not so self-righteous

304
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,070
to do something far beyond my ability.

305
00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:28,700
Besides,

306
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:30,040
Fengling

307
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:31,560
is my own sister.

308
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,910
I have no reason not to help her.

309
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,060
Compared to the business

310
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,860
or things in martial artists community,

311
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,450
I

312
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:41,750
care more about my sister.

313
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,640
You should believe that, right?

314
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,260
Fine.

315
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,400
I can help Fengling open the Small Kunlun.

316
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,220
But after I open it,

317
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,630
whatever there is in it,

318
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:06,570
you must return the dragon bone to me immediately.

319
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:10,530
Deal.

320
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,980
Director Luo,

321
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:17,460
if you don't return it,

322
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,510
I will swear in front of Fengling today

323
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:22,620
to kill you.

324
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:29,170
Fengling, do you hear her?

325
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,950
She wants to kill your brother.

326
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:33,710
I'm the police director.

327
00:20:33,710 --> 00:20:34,930
How dare you!

328
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,000
But let me tell you.

329
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:38,670
I really want to know

330
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:40,890
how you can kill me.

331
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:48,290
The dragon bone is the sacred object of the Penta-sect.

332
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:50,300
If someone wants to take the dragon bone by force,

333
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,810
about a thousand of our disciples

334
00:20:51,810 --> 00:20:54,960
will definitely take the dragon bone back no matter what the cost is.

335
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,050
And hunt down

336
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:58,090
who offended the dragon bone.

337
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:12,940
Let alone you are a police director.

338
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:15,180
Even if you are the emperor,

339
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,380
I guess by then,

340
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,730
we would just take your life following this.

341
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:19,830
It shouldn't be hard for Director Luo

342
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,560
to imagine such a scene, right?

343
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,600
Wu Shuang.

344
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,070
Wait a minute.

345
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,240
I'll discuss it with my brother.

346
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,010
No need.

347
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:34,270
It's a deal.

348
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:50,570
Why are you here?

349
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,890
I'm afraid you'll fight with them.

350
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,490
Do I like fighting that much?

351
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:56,910
Besides,

352
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,420
you were standing outside the door.

353
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,480
How would you know if I fought inside?

354
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,770
Just tell me if you care about me.

355
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,540
Stop pretending.

356
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,410
How did it go?

357
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,700
Can we get the dragon bone tomorrow?

358
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,070
I can't get it tomorrow.

359
00:22:22,490 --> 00:22:23,410
Luo Yunsong asked me

360
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,970
to open the Small Kunlun for Chu Fengling.

361
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,770
And after that he will return the dragon bone to me.

362
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,880
You agreed?

363
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,350
Yes.

364
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,480
Why not?

365
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,510
Yunqi.

366
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,230
Are you

367
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:50,330
free today?

368
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:51,550
Or are you here

369
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:52,980
to deliver goods?

370
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,070
Commander,

371
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:56,210
I'm here

372
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,450
to bring you information.

373
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:01,970
Tell me.

374
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,990
The Han tomb you blew up

375
00:23:05,410 --> 00:23:07,130
was targeted by Luo Yunsong.

376
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:16,670
So what?

377
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:18,470
I even want to blow up two more.

378
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,610
Since the era is chaotic,

379
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,600
I'll get what I want in the chaos

380
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:24,180
and then

381
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,830
frame the Heaven Official for ghoul.

382
00:23:27,670 --> 00:23:29,270
Am I using the word right?

383
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,360
My honey Yanzhi.

384
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,040
My Commander.

385
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,720
This time,

386
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,370
you are not upholding justice.

387
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:37,370
What did I do?

388
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,470
Didn't we agree that

389
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,190
you open the tomb to get treasures

390
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:42,790
and I will help with selling them.

391
00:23:42,790 --> 00:23:45,060
Then, you get 90% and I 10%？

392
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,250
We haven't sold it yet, have we?

393
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,440
Let me tell you.

394
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:54,510
If I lie to you,

395
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:56,310
next time the tomb that is blown up

396
00:23:56,310 --> 00:23:57,490
will be mine.

397
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,080
Don't say that.

398
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:04,540
Honey Yanzhi.

399
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,620
How did he know it was me?

400
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:10,090
Did you use the explosives

401
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:11,260
that you let Cui Yi

402
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:13,030
sell for you?

403
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,280
Commander.

404
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,470
Is it the same batch?

405
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:25,050
The explosives you mentioned...

406
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,520
Get lost!

407
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:33,520
Yes, sir.

408
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,120
So what?

409
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:37,070
I didn't make the explosives.

410
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,540
My commander.

411
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,550
You are the only one

412
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,850
in Zhejiang and Shanghai who has this kind of explosive.

413
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,340
Otherwise,

414
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:49,020
why would someone come all the way

415
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,110
from Henan

416
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,450
for this kind of explosive specially?

417
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:54,870
Now Luo Yunsong has found out that

418
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:57,470
this is the explosive that exploded the tomb.

419
00:24:58,090 --> 00:25:00,950
Do you think it's far from finding out it was you?

420
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,220
That makes sense.

421
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,750
Don't get into trouble

422
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,270
for just the profit.

423
00:25:13,090 --> 00:25:15,520
Why are there so many bad guys nowadays?

424
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:19,300
Exactly.

425
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:21,200
There are bad guys everywhere.

426
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:23,460
I dare not go out.

427
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,900
Don't, don't say that.

428
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,540
You have to go out.

429
00:25:30,390 --> 00:25:31,360
So,

430
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,430
I only dare to come to you.

431
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:36,100
There are no bad people here.

432
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,250
Don't say that.

433
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:41,650
There's really a bad guy here now.

434
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:42,990
Who?

435
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,260
Xue Dingfeng,

436
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,530
nicknamed Huanghe Laogui.

437
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,100
He was with

438
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,950
Luo Yunsong's brother Luo Jiutian.

439
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:55,460
I do know him.

440
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:57,220
He's a grave robber.

441
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:00,210
After he followed Luo Jiutian, he just did nothing

442
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,070
and was kicked out by Luo Yunsong.

443
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:03,650
Why did he come to you?

444
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:08,150
He said

445
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,420
he wanted to give me a set of wealth.

446
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,950
What is that?

447
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,150
Kunlun Mountains.

448
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:24,440
This story has been spread for hundreds of years.

449
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,840
Do you really believe it?

450
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:27,000
Not only me.

451
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,410
Hand it to me.

452
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,190
Go away.

453
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,160
See?

454
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:43,260
[Wanted Poster]

455
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:39,230
Luo Yunsong went so crazy

456
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,120
to find Ding Yuanshan

457
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:44,940
because he wants to get information about the Kunlun Mountains.

458
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,450
If he doesn't believe it,

459
00:26:46,870 --> 00:26:48,470
how could he risk his life

460
00:26:48,970 --> 00:26:50,940
to fight with a bunch of

461
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:53,500
people who also risk their lives in martial artists community？

462
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:55,230
He wants the Kunlun Mountains?

463
00:26:55,770 --> 00:26:58,120
Yes, he just wants it.

464
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,720
But he won't be able to touch anything.

465
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:05,890
My honey Yanzhi.

466
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:10,560
Send out a message for me.

467
00:27:11,350 --> 00:27:12,610
Tell them that I robbed

468
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,080
the Han tomb.

469
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:17,910
Make sure Luo Yunsong knows it.

470
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,520
I don't understand

471
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,990
your move this time, Commander.

472
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,160
Since we'll meet sooner or later,

473
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:29,500
it's better to face it.

474
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,100
More or less,

475
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,910
I can get to know

476
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,920
about the Kunlun Mountains.

477
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:52,660
You shouldn't have agreed.

478
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,120
This is my own business.

479
00:27:57,430 --> 00:27:58,520
If Master knows it some day,

480
00:27:58,520 --> 00:27:59,920
he will blame me, not you.

481
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,630
You just want the dragon bone back, right?

482
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:02,550
Are you crazy?

483
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,570
How could it be get your dragon bone back?

484
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:06,830
You're not helping me.

485
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:08,430
You're still thinking about it.

486
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:09,430
Don't mention it.

487
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:11,840
You're just thinking about it.

488
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,810
So what?

489
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,530
It's none of your business. Who are you to me?

490
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:16,930
Who are you to control me?

491
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:19,270
Wu Shuang,

492
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,370
I really don't want you to

493
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:23,540
make useless efforts again and again.

494
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,190
I did it myself.

495
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,780
I didn't ask you to make efforts.

496
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,840
Don't you worry me.

497
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,820
So sweet.

498
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:35,730
San Jin.

499
00:28:36,190 --> 00:28:36,990
I want it, too.

500
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,760
Put down the knife.

501
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:52,150
Don't you know a killer won't knock?

502
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,950
Open the door.

503
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,010
Hurry!

504
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,450
Mr. Ding, sorry to bother you.

505
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:17,560
I'm sure you are here to give me some guidance, Master Jiu.

506
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,620
Please have a seat.

507
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,740
San Jin, make tea.

508
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,920
Master Jiu, this is Ms. Wu Shuang.

509
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,000
A rising star of mound-digging field.

510
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,020
Nice to meet you.

511
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,710
As promised,

512
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:33,520
young master should meet my master

513
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,720
in the tea room today.

514
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:35,830
But my master

515
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,010
asked me to come here to visit specially.

516
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,010
I came uninvited.

517
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,040
Please forgive me.

518
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:46,860
You work for Cui Yanzhi?

519
00:29:47,590 --> 00:29:48,510
Why do you even know

520
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:49,910
where we live so clearly?

521
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,980
The unclear things in martial artists community

522
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:57,080
are unclear

523
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,030
because people don't want to make them clear.

524
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:04,340
For things that should be clear,

525
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,750
everyone has a notebook for them.

526
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:09,980
I understand. It's normal.

527
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:12,870
I visited Ms. Cui.

528
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:14,550
It's reasonable

529
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,360
that Ms. Cui visits us in return.

530
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,030
But

531
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,340
you don't come here

532
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,570
just to complete the manner, right?

533
00:30:24,510 --> 00:30:27,070
We've got the information of your request.

534
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,000
My master doesn't want to delay it,

535
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,300
so she asked me

536
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:31,860
to visit you.

537
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:34,960
So soon?

538
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:38,590
No wonder they say Ms. Cui is very resourceful.

539
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,250
[Meishan]

540
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:46,910
This is a letter

541
00:30:48,610 --> 00:30:51,470
the tomb raid instigator wrote to the tomb raiders.

542
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:56,970
Who is this Meishan?

543
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,750
You might not know this name.

544
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:02,600
But you must know

545
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:03,860
his aother name,

546
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,710
General Sanxi.

547
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,660
Are you talking about Commander Hu,

548
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:12,550
who likes money, land and women?

549
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,270
Yes.

550
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:19,310
Hu Kuilu, from Meishan, Sichuan.

551
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,620
It's really him.

552
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:25,670
I thought he just sells explosives in secret.

553
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,840
I didn't expect...

554
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,030
Ms. Cui is so capable.

555
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,130
She could even get such a letter.

556
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,110
Master Jiu, this letter...

557
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,160
Master said to give it to you.

558
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,720
San Jin.

559
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:41,190
Give Mr. Cui's photo to Master Jiu.

560
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:42,500
No need.

561
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,510
Master said

562
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:45,770
it's equally safe

563
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,910
with you.

564
00:31:47,830 --> 00:31:48,550
Goodbye.

565
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,440
Take care.

566
00:31:58,830 --> 00:31:59,760
Why is he so nice?

567
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:01,870
Sending you the letter in person.

568
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,660
First,

569
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,860
Cui Yanzhi wants to tell us.

570
00:32:06,050 --> 00:32:08,030
If she really wants to fall out with us,

571
00:32:08,030 --> 00:32:09,120
she can choose to knock

572
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,310
or not.

573
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:11,310
Second,

574
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:13,600
it concerns Commander Hu.

575
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,130
She must be careful.

576
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:16,560
Leaving the letter to us.

577
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:18,360
He will definitely take action.

578
00:32:18,530 --> 00:32:19,710
It's normal that

579
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,410
she doesn't want to get involved.

580
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:29,120
Didn't you say you don't know the martial artists community?

581
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,000
I think you do.

582
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,550
This is human heart.

583
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,420
I know a bit about human heart.

584
00:32:34,030 --> 00:32:35,230
Do you really know it?

585
00:32:42,050 --> 00:32:43,480
I was just bluffing.

586
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,920
I'll show this letter to Luo Yunsong

587
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,570
to restore my father's reputation and get the dragon bone back.

588
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,680
You just said you know human heart.

589
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,810
I don't think you do.

590
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,160
Let me tell you.

591
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:59,100
Luo Yunsong doesn't care who robbed the tomb.

592
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,120
He doesn't care about the dragon bone, either.

593
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,250
He has said it many times.

594
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:03,450
He wants your father.

595
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:06,800
Then why did you agree to open the tomb for him?

596
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,010
I was entrusting my only hope

597
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,480
on Fengling.

598
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,770
If I open the tomb for her,

599
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,720
maybe

600
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,360
she can help me find the dragon bone back.

601
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,830
I'm so touched.

602
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,140
Really.

603
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,440
Every time

604
00:33:57,520 --> 00:33:59,580
I am so touched

605
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:02,090
by this song of Madam Butterfly.

606
00:34:02,270 --> 00:34:04,070
Sir, this is a minuet.

607
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:07,690
Yes. They are both about love, right?

608
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:08,480
Yes.

609
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,870
Shut up. Get out.

610
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,380
Little Boss.

611
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,199
Do you have a lover?

612
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,460
Yes, in Tianjin.

613
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,810
But do you know

614
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:23,860
people like us...

615
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:25,620
We travel everywhere and do errands.

616
00:34:25,620 --> 00:34:27,820
It's hard to have a place to settle down.

617
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,739
We're the same kind of people.

618
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,010
We all missed

619
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,570
so much beauty of life,

620
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,500
like Madam Butterfly.

621
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,429
By the way, Master Tian,

622
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:42,380
our ship has arrived at the open sea.

623
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,980
Have you prepared the money?

624
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,360
The ship is at the open sea?

625
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,139
Hurry up and let it

626
00:34:49,389 --> 00:34:50,820
go ashore, right?

627
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,159
If it stays on the sea for one more day,

628
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,929
it costs a lot of money to burn oil.

629
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:55,270
Besides,

630
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,449
the crew finally

631
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:57,750
came to Shanghai.

632
00:34:57,830 --> 00:34:59,180
You have to let them

633
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,810
step on the land and have fun, right?

634
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:01,910
Get to the shore and deliver the goods.

635
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:02,620
Set a date.

636
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,220
It's very convenient.

637
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:07,310
When the money is ready, we can deliver at any time.

638
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:08,890
Speaking of money,

639
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:10,590
I want to discuss with you.

640
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,070
Master Tian, at this point,

641
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,920
you can't bargain with me anymore.

642
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,470
I have offered you the lowest price

643
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:16,860
to have a long-term cooperation

644
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:18,320
in Shanghai in the future.

645
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,680
To be honest,

646
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,400
I have to explain it

647
00:35:22,570 --> 00:35:23,580
to my boss for this price.

648
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:24,670
Why are you panicking?

649
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,100
I just said one sentence, and you said 10.

650
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,760
When did I say I would bargain?

651
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,580
I didn't say to bargain, right?

652
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:30,510
No.

653
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:31,940
I...

654
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,880
A person who believes in love,

655
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,520
is responsible.

656
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,140
Yes.

657
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:37,730
Follow the rules.

658
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:38,490
Yes.

659
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:43,110
Speaking of the rules, I want to talk to you.

660
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:44,500
I know the rules.

661
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:45,670
You know?

662
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:47,560
You know your rules,

663
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,740
Not mine.

664
00:35:50,290 --> 00:35:51,930
Then your rules are...

665
00:35:53,270 --> 00:35:54,360
My rule is

666
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,510
no matter

667
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,860
how big the business is,

668
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,500
I won't pay the deposit.

669
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:04,570
No.

670
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,790
Master Tian.

671
00:36:07,470 --> 00:36:09,270
It's the tradition

672
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,670
for thousands of years to pay a deposit.

673
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,800
And we agreed to pay the deposit today.

674
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,480
Why did you ask me for the deposit?

675
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:19,520
You are just afraid that I'll run away, right?

676
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,820
This is Shanghai.

677
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:22,420
Shanghai is my home.

678
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:23,690
Can I leave my home?

679
00:36:24,010 --> 00:36:26,010
My home can't be without me, either.

680
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:27,790
The reason I didn't give you the deposit is...

681
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:28,630
Who are you?

682
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,770
Little bastard.

683
00:36:31,030 --> 00:36:32,160
If I give you the deposit,

684
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,890
what should I do if you run away?

685
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:34,680
Besides,

686
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,400
no one in Shanghai

687
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:39,310
can afford such a big batch of goods, right?

688
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:42,410
Yes, you're right.

689
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,550
If I hadn't met you by chance,

690
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:45,940
I would have

691
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:48,040
contacted the Xuanwei Zitan Club.

692
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:50,390
Such a big patch of goods,

693
00:36:50,730 --> 00:36:52,030
apart from Badagu Party,

694
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,790
only you and the Xuanwei Zitan Club

695
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:54,590
can take it.

696
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,550
I don't mind.

697
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,900
Don't mention people.

698
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,410
Don't mention them.

699
00:36:59,670 --> 00:37:01,520
I know them all, okay?

700
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:04,670
The club and...

701
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:06,050
If they want it,

702
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,860
they must get my admit first.

703
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,540
So I will have the goods.

704
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,020
I'll distribute the goods to them, understand?

705
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,480
Send the ship to the shore.

706
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,870
I will pay when I get the goods.

707
00:37:14,870 --> 00:37:15,760
Deal.

708
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,660
Okay, Master Tian.

709
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:19,750
I trust you.

710
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,720
I'll let you know when it's done.

711
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:22,630
Okay, go ahead.

712
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:25,330
Make way.

713
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,140
-Move. Move. -Leave.

714
00:37:27,470 --> 00:37:28,600
You can't walk here.

715
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:29,870
Make a detour.

716
00:37:40,070 --> 00:37:41,040
Well...

717
00:37:45,910 --> 00:37:46,670
Master Tian.

718
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:48,980
Well...

719
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,790
Well...

720
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,100
What is Ziwei Club?

721
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,120
It's Xuanwei Zitan.

722
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,920
What is it?

723
00:37:58,510 --> 00:37:59,980
That club is awesome.

724
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,370
Before the north expedition,

725
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,710
it was the information trade place of the black market

726
00:38:02,710 --> 00:38:04,050
in half of China.

727
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:07,580
The boss only takes the commission and doesn't take part in business.

728
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,310
He really started from scratch

729
00:38:09,390 --> 00:38:11,390
and made 10 thousand gold every day.

730
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,740
This is a good job.

731
00:38:13,670 --> 00:38:14,640
This is good.

732
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,280
But if you do such a business, you need to have a background...

733
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,630
It has to be powerful, right?

734
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,390
I don't know about the background.

735
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,480
The boss is a woman.

736
00:38:22,110 --> 00:38:22,870
A woman?

737
00:38:23,210 --> 00:38:24,630
Yes, a woman.

738
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,190
And

739
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,700
a very pretty one.

740
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,250
Look at you.

741
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:31,100
When you say she's pretty, you just...

742
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,450
Master Tian wants to hit on her, too?

743
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,540
You know nothing.

744
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,360
Stand there as the punishment.

745
00:38:45,970 --> 00:38:48,950
Xuanwei Zitan.
