[Episode 32]

4
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,650
Fengling.

5
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:56,250
I want to talk to you calmly.

6
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,820
Well,

7
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,540
I want to be honest

8
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,180
and talk to you calmly as well.

9
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:31,700
Sit.

10
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,190
Okay. I'll go first.

11
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,310
Fengling.

12
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,410
First,

13
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,980
I require you to accept Wu Shuang.

14
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,480
Require?

15
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,190
Yes.

16
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,430
Isn't this an equal negotiation?

17
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,900
I refuse an unequal negotiation.

18
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,600
Brother.

19
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:19,120
This is between you and Fengling. How about we...

20
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,870
No need.

21
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:21,850
Now,

22
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:23,440
this is our business.

23
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,180
I think

24
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,210
you are not qualified to talk about equality.

25
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:31,840
Why?

26
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:34,660
I have the Soul Pursuit Order and Her Ladyship.

27
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,760
I have the right to demand equality.

28
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,530
First,

29
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,670
you don't own the Soul Pursuit Order.

30
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:42,810
It belongs to us all.

31
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:44,070
Second,

32
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,240
speaking of Her Ladyship,

33
00:03:45,829 --> 00:03:47,220
she doesn't really trust you.

34
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,730
Otherwise,

35
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,320
Jiutian won't be alive.

36
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,670
Based on these two points,

37
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:54,270
you have no right to demand equality.

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,550
Feudal warlord.

39
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,230
Yes.

40
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,980
But don't forget,

41
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,460
you were raised by a feudal warlord.

42
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:20,269
Since we didn't agree on the first term,

43
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,700
there's no need to talk about the second one.

44
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:23,710
I'll just tell you the result.

45
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,980
What do you want?

46
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:27,660
Are you chasing me away?

47
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,730
Yunqi.

48
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,950
I thought we had an agreement.

49
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,940
Now this is the business between you two.

50
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,950
What agreement?

51
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:41,140
The one about you threatening Yunqi

52
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:42,909
with the Soul Pursuit Order?

53
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,290
I'm your brother.

54
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:45,470
This is between us.

55
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,390
It's useless for you to go to him.

56
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,050
You can stay if you want.

57
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,220
On what condition?

58
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,110
From now on,

59
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,540
we won't inform you of any of our actions.

60
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,480
Or you may go send the news secretly again.

61
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,030
Also,

62
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,960
I've asked Biao

63
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,100
to follow you.

64
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:14,620
Follow me?

65
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,390
Don't sugarcoat it.

66
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:18,690
You want him to monitor me.

67
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,590
I'm your sister,

68
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,060
not your criminal.

69
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,870
If you don't want to,

70
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,750
fine.

71
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,140
Go tell Her Ladyship

72
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,360
and get me arrested.

73
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,740
Make me her criminal.

74
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,550
But first,

75
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,570
you have to be able to get out of this yard.

76
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,710
You want to throw the cup?

77
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,270
Sure.

78
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:47,210
You are qualified.

79
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,010
Throw it.

80
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,600
Everyone is here.

81
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:33,909
Wu Shuang is here too.

82
00:06:40,870 --> 00:06:41,890
Yunqi is back.

83
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,159
We're about to leave.

84
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:45,920
There are some things

85
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:47,980
that need to be clarified.

86
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:51,720
Yunqi? Sounds like you are close.

87
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,850
Get to the point.

88
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,260
You impersonated me in Tianjin, right?

89
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,900
Yes.

90
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,710
I'm not as pretty as you.

91
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:03,230
But you didn't lose anything.

92
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,730
I limped all the way

93
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,580
and followed you to Tianjin secretly

94
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,380
because

95
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,780
I've been with Mr. Luo Yunsong

96
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,920
for many years.

97
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,220
I know him well.

98
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:19,860
I could guess

99
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,500
what he was thinking.

100
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,970
You didn't forget about

101
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:25,530
Lord Hao's yard in Tianjin, did you?

102
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,120
You asked me to find him

103
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,680
that place.

104
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:31,870
So you killed Lord Hao?

105
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,630
Yes.

106
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,270
But it was not my problem.

107
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:37,750
I had a good brother

108
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,850
who said I was always dilly-dallying

109
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,940
and hesitant.

110
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:43,800
So I did it arbitrarily.

111
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,640
It felt good.

112
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,530
If I had known,

113
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:48,750
I should have listened to my brother since I was a kid.

114
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,430
Are you human?

115
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:52,780
How old was Lord Hao?

116
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,000
How could you do that?

117
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:57,030
You can't blame me, right?

118
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,960
I have

119
00:07:59,470 --> 00:08:00,470
the Soul Pursuit Order.

120
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,450
At least it can keep me alive,

121
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,210
right?

122
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,090
Besides,

123
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:05,890
if he didn't die,

124
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,010
I would.

125
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,090
Jiutian.

126
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Leave the Soul Pursuit Order of Mountain-demounting and leave.

127
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,820
I'm indebted to Godfather.

128
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,950
I will pay your debt

129
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,590
for you.

130
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,870
What do you mean?

131
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,560
One coaxes, the other coerces.

132
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,820
You want to coax me

133
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:26,590
to give you my life-saving order?

134
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,610
You don't have to trust us,

135
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,540
but you can trust your brother.

136
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:31,890
Who?

137
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:34,030
You are one mind in different bodies.

138
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,539
I only trust myself.

139
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,980
Fine, I'll kill you now

140
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,360
and avenge Lord Hao.

141
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,750
Our people from Penta-sect

142
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,010
can't be killed in vain.

143
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,530
Sun Sanxuan, who do you think you are?

144
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:47,090
Do you think you can kill me?

145
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,810
Do you believe there's a sniper gun

146
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:50,070
not far away,

147
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,370
pointing at your butt,

148
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,310
and a few machine guns

149
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,450
pointing at all of you in the room?

150
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,030
I dared to come alone today,

151
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,590
so I dare to leave alone.

152
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,890
If you want a life-and-death struggle,

153
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:05,650
I can't say how many of you can survive today.

154
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,150
Mr. Luo Yunsong,

155
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,550
I'm not targeting you.

156
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,690
Why should I?

157
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,200
I'm not familiar with you.

158
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,150
I am

159
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,870
just a dog.

160
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,220
Her Ladyship's dog.

161
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,580
She only cares about the Kunlun Mountains,

162
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,130
not me.

163
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:30,680
Even if she didn't send me here,

164
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,030
she could have sent someone else.

165
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,760
Isn't it good that she sent me?

166
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,440
At least I'm quite familiar

167
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,610
with all of you.

168
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,010
My vulnerability can also be found here.

169
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,170
Now,

170
00:09:44,630 --> 00:09:47,530
the situation of Tian Long is unclear.

171
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,090
I think I'm your best shelter.

172
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:52,780
As for Fengling, I've asked Biao

173
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,090
to keep an eye on her.

174
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,140
She won't have a chance to contact you.

175
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:58,320
It's meaningless

176
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,580
for you to follow us.

177
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,600
If I don't follow you,

178
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,070
that would be meaningless.

179
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,380
I'm a dog.

180
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,780
A dog will die without meaning.

181
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,330
Do you understand?

182
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,320
Think carefully.

183
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,570
Think about it.

184
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,060
You'll bear the consequences of

185
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,230
the choice you make.

186
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:27,550
People own their own lives.

187
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,940
I'll be responsible for

188
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,940
my own choice.

189
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,000
Ding Yunqi.

190
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,940
I envy you.

191
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,500
I also hope you can win.

192
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,530
Because only if you win,

193
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:43,010
everyone will get

194
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,900
the best of it.

195
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:56,150
Mr. Luo Jiutian,

196
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,500
we've made it clear.

197
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:01,910
You can leave now.

198
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,730
I thought you would want me to stay for dinner.

199
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,160
Goodbye.

200
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:09,300
Take care.

201
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:44,160
I really lost my brother this time.

202
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,260
Fengling.

203
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,110
Time for dinner.

204
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,420
Fengling.

205
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,600
No matter how unhappy you are,

206
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,450
and what plans you have for the future,

207
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,510
you have to eat.

208
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,440
Fengling.

209
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,660
I want to talk to you.

210
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:45,560
Fengling.

211
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,830
What do you want to say?

212
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,850
Open the door. I don't want to talk to the door.

213
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,850
San Jin specially spared it for you.

214
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:23,150
Don't waste it.

215
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,880
Don't you think it's none of your business?

216
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:27,810
It's not that I want to mind your business.

217
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:30,330
But if you don't want to eat,

218
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:31,840
I'll tell San Jin

219
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,020
that he won't need to do it anymore.

220
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:41,960
Not everyone will spoil you like this.

221
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:47,380
I don't plan to treat you as my sister.

222
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:48,310
You don't have to spoil me.

223
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:49,270
Good.

224
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,410
At least we have reached a consensus

225
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,970
on this matter.

226
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,220
But I want to remind you that

227
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,440
being willful requires capital.

228
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,510
The reason why you can still be so willful

229
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:04,940
is because there are people who care about you.

230
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:07,920
But I don't know how long

231
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,770
they will care about you if you keep on being like this.

232
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:11,910
By then,

233
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,180
how can you still be so willful?

234
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:20,770
Think about it.

235
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,350
Wu Shuang.

236
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:33,960
Thank you for trying to persuade her.

237
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:37,280
She won't listen to anyone now.

238
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:40,050
Thank you for not giving up on her.

239
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,290
Make sure she eats.

240
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,070
Wait.

241
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:36,290
Why are you wandering around

242
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:38,220
carrying a transceiver?

243
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:41,410
Help them load the car.

244
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,330
Okay.

245
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,250
Where are the tissues? Nature is calling.

246
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,100
Here.

247
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,230
Here.

248
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,150
Hurry.

249
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:03,710
Her Ladyship just called.

250
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,100
She ordered us to take care of Luo Jiutian.

251
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,570
Tonight is the best time.

252
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,330
Do you have a plan?

253
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,610
Here.

254
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,820
First, we can...

255
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,780
Young Master, run!

256
00:17:54,130 --> 00:17:54,820
After him!

257
00:19:07,710 --> 00:19:08,250
Brother.

258
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,260
Is it the Black Feather Team?

259
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:11,360
It doesn't sound like them.

260
00:19:11,870 --> 00:19:13,130
Could it be Luo Jiutian?

261
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:15,690
Maybe.

262
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,080
Biao, who's shooting?

263
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:30,850
I don't know.

264
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,570
Don't come out no matter what happens.

265
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:57,160
You're crazy. Why do you want to kill me?

266
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,840
It's Her Ladyship's order.

267
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:01,820
Why?

268
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,250
Why?

269
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,550
Her Ladyship said

270
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:06,650
you betrayed her.

271
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,360
Kill me?

272
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,970
My name is Jiutian, so I have nine lives.

273
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,550
Gui.

274
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:54,400
Gui.

275
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,030
Who else?

276
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:01,750
Who else?

277
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,730
Jiutian.

278
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:00,830
Jiutian.

279
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:05,530
Jiutian.

280
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,930
What?

281
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,450
What?

282
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,680
What do you want?

283
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,600
I should have given

284
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,260
the Soul Pursuit Order to you long ago.

285
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,000
I didn't

286
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:41,820
because I was afraid

287
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:45,260
you would leave me.

288
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,090
Don't cry.

289
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,450
In my next life,

290
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:07,140
I can be

291
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,580
better-looking,

292
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,020
better-

293
00:28:12,390 --> 00:28:13,150
educated.

294
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,380
This way,

295
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:18,900
my family

296
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,210
and others

297
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:26,090
will love me.

298
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,850
Jiutian.

299
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,050

00:29:14,850 --> 00:29:16,020
I am

[Tomb of My Brother Luo Jiutian]

305
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,150
Luo Jiutian.

306
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:43,170
We'll depart today.

307
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:46,190
I'll keep the Soul Pursuit Order with me.

308
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,260
No matter where we go,

309
00:30:49,970 --> 00:30:51,110
you'll be with us.

310

[Tomb of My Brother Luo Jiutian]

311
00:30:53,670 --> 00:30:54,970
Mound-digging is my home.

312
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,070
I'll come back in the future.

313
00:30:58,370 --> 00:30:59,510
When we come back,

314
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,150
we'll tell you

315
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,490
all about

316
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:05,180
what happened on the way.

317
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,800
Wu Shuang.

318
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,060
Let's go.

319
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,150
Here we are.

320
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:34,870
Thank you, uncle.

321
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:43,860
Mr. Luo,

322
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,620
I'm so sorry.

323
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,430
I can't believe this happened in Mound-digging Sect.

324
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:48,600
My condolences.

325
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,230
Senior Jiang,

326
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,040
I asked you to investigate it.

327
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,340
How's it going?

328
00:31:58,770 --> 00:31:59,610
Yesterday,

329
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:00,870
there was a gunfight

330
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:01,920
in the southwest forest.

331
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,610
I asked Mr. He to identify the bodies for me.

332
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,330
Xue Dingfeng is dead.

333
00:32:06,830 --> 00:32:08,340
Three soldiers also died in the forest.

334
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:09,980
Two more bodies floated up this morning.

335
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,660
Judging from their outfit, they were a team.

336
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,110
They must have been members on Jiutian's team.

337
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,540
What happened?

338
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:20,270
Two men in black also died by the river yesterday.

339
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,740
But they looked very unfamiliar.

340
00:32:21,870 --> 00:32:22,960
They were not from Mound-digging.

341
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,720
Judging from the blood by the river,

342
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,360
Jiutian was injured by the river

343
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,790
and he returned to the camp with the injuries.

344
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:28,840
Brother.

345
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:31,070
We found this by the river.

346
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,560
A transceiver?

347
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:37,030
Yes.

348
00:32:39,630 --> 00:32:41,060
We haven't had time to investigate the details

349
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:43,620
of what exactly happened to Jiutian.

350
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,970
But don't worry.

351
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:47,450
We will definitely find out the cause of death

352
00:32:47,450 --> 00:32:48,410
of Jiutian.

353
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,290
Thank you.

354
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:50,090
You're welcome.

355
00:32:50,390 --> 00:32:51,900
This happened in Mound-digging.

356
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,910
We will give

357
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:54,500
the Luo brothers an explanation.

358
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,720
Thank you.

359
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,880
Wu Shuang.

360
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:06,850
Take it.

361
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,790
This is the guidebook

362
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,680
of mound-digging business roadmap.

363
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:12,730
It records

364
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,700
all the gas stations and courier stations.

365
00:33:14,950 --> 00:33:16,210
There are also places

366
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,220
where you can stay and rest.

367
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:19,030
I've marked all the shops

368
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,410
with connections to Mound-digging

369
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,630
in it.

370
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,100
You can ask them for money or anything.

371
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,830
Thank you, Senior Jiang.

372
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:26,970
Wu Shuang.

373
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,650
Everyone in Mound-digging is waiting for you to come back.

374
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:30,960
Wu Shuang,

375
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:32,220
you must come back.

376
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:33,560
Remember to write to us.

377
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,740
I will.

378
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:37,840
Sister.

379
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:40,360
Senior Hua is not a bad person.

380
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,800
He just wants to be the sect leader.

381
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,730
I mean...

382
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:45,700
I know.

383
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:47,460
Take care.

384
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:49,270
I will think it through.

385
00:33:53,890 --> 00:33:54,770
Please rest assured, Sect Leader.

386
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,950
I will take good care of Mound-digging for you

387
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,300
and wait for you to come back.

388
00:34:00,610 --> 00:34:01,200
Take care.

389
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,130
Take care.

390
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:05,980
Take care.

391
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,870

♫What's up? What's up?♫

409
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:28,150
Here.

410
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:28,780
Brother.

411
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,540
Their car is really awesome.

412
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,550
Is it here, Yunqi?

413
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,620
But the map is not complete.

414
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,940
The end is only river and mountains.

415
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,810
Wu Shuang.

416
00:36:49,610 --> 00:36:51,000
Can you tell what it is?

417
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:54,020
This is a question come up with by a mover.

418
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,530
If the Heaven Official can't solve it,

419
00:36:55,530 --> 00:36:57,090
no one else can.

420
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,330
Look.

421
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:13,170
There is a cave mouth

422
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,310
where the mountains and waters connect, right?

423
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,220
The color of the cave mouth

424
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:21,320
looks like it has been soaked in the river for years.

425
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,350
The tide has descended recently,

426
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,850
so it appeared.

427
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,340
So this cave mouth only appears

428
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,940
when the tide descends.

429
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,370
No one will notice it then.

430
00:37:35,390 --> 00:37:36,990
Maybe this time we're really close.

431
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,550
Using the natural barrier of nature

432
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:42,360
is the best way to protect the Kunlun Mountains.

433
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,570
We just passed by many fishing villages.

434
00:37:47,570 --> 00:37:48,870
I saw a lot of boats.

435
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,130
I'll go get some.

436
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,220
OK.

437
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:52,820
We'll camp today

438
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,160
and enter the cave tomorrow.

439
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:56,010
Let's see what is waiting for us.

440
00:37:59,230 --> 00:37:59,830
Biao,

441
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:01,810
find an elusive spot

442
00:38:01,810 --> 00:38:02,770
to hide the car.

443
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,660
Yes.

444
00:38:24,610 --> 00:38:25,410
Give it to me.

445
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:26,590
Be careful.

446
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:30,070
Let me do it.

447
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,110
♫Don't cry♫

448
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:46,180
♫We promised we'll be happy♫

449
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,190
♫Even if tears of sadness are about to drop♫

450
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,770
♫We have to hold it back♫

451
00:38:57,690 --> 00:39:01,060
♫Don't cry anymore♫

452
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:07,930
♫Close your eyes to realize♫

453
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:15,440
♫Wind and rain are actually gifts♫

454
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:23,020
♫The sky cleared with the help of light♫

455
00:39:23,290 --> 00:39:26,120
♫It finally put together♫

456
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:33,020
♫A different rainbow puzzle♫

457
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,060
♫We promised♫

458
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:39,110
♫To be happy♫

459
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,090
♫We'll protect ♫

460
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:45,280
♫The sweet and bitter memories together ♫

461
00:39:45,590 --> 00:39:53,470
♫We've promised that whether it's a smooth path or full of thorns♫

462
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,910
♫We won't care♫

463
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:00,610
♫Go with you♫

464
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:03,650
♫We promised♫

465
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:07,600
♫To be happy♫

466
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:09,440
♫I'll protect you♫

467
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,540
♫Unrestrained♫

468
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:21,310
♫We promised even if I had to give my all♫

469
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,930
♫I would♫

470
00:40:26,930 --> 00:40:31,050
♫Go with you♫

471
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,750
San Jin.

472
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,110
Look how beautiful it is up there.

473
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:21,470
We're close to the cave mouth.

474
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:22,730
I think

475
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,570
we should be able to anchor the boat ahead.

476
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:25,500
Look, there seems to be a dock.

477
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,020
We're almost there.

478
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:11,410
Slow down.

479
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,680
This is Bawang Xiejia.

480
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,160
Yunqi.

481
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:28,910
I've only read about this kind of feng shui in books.

482
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,030
What's Bawang Xiejia?

483
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,840
How would I know that?

484
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:36,690
Let's find a place to camp first

485
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:38,740
and investigate this place carefully tomorrow.

486
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,010
OK.

487
00:42:41,190 --> 00:42:41,940
Here.

488
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,570
Move them.

489
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:43,410
OK.

490
00:43:04,710 --> 00:43:05,590
Yunqi.

491
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:07,310
Do you think it's here?

492
00:43:10,270 --> 00:43:11,680
This place is surrounded by mountains,

493
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:14,040
so it's very hard for people to find.

494
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,710
The elusiveness is enough.

495
00:43:16,070 --> 00:43:18,230
Bawang Xiejia is a valuable place with perfect feng shui.

496
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:21,900
But considering the importance of the Kunlun Mountains,

497
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:23,620
it seems not matching.

498
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:27,870
Given the elusiveness,

499
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,020
I think this is it.

500
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,140
Do you think we should call Brother's people

501
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:33,850
and Black Feather Team

502
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:34,860
all over here?

503
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,460
Why? Are you worried?

504
00:43:38,090 --> 00:43:38,890
Of course.

505
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:41,790
I think Tian Long must be watching us

506
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,340
somewhere dark.

507
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:44,690
And we don't know

508
00:43:44,690 --> 00:43:45,780
how many of them there are.

509
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,040
I'm afraid if...

510
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:49,980
No matter how many people he brings,

511
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:52,290
we won't let him go back this time.

512
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,390
You are just saying.

513
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,240
You won't kill him then.

514
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:00,190
Why do you think so?

515
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:01,490
Being kind to him

516
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,830
is being cruel to everyone else.

517
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,550
He has killed so many people.

518
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,450
We must make him pay with his own life.
