[Episode 31]

4
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:46,970
Who is it?

5
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:48,700
It's me, Yunqi.

6
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,600
I don't want to see anyone.

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,530
You can talk outside.

8
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:59,280
Sure enough, you can't fool people by blood relationship.

9
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,940
You and Wu Shuang are the same.

10
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,980
You always keep people outside.

11
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,490
I'm different from her.

12
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,940
That's true.

13
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:16,120
Wu Shuang never takes my provocation.

14
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,829
Did you come to be my brother-in-law

15
00:02:21,829 --> 00:02:23,760
or teach me a lesson for my brother?

16
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,870
Why don't we go in and talk?

17
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,690
Close the door.

18
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,329
I want to tell you that

19
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,050
I hope you can leave.

20
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,170
Why?

21
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,560
Because of my brother?

22
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,870
I didn't break our agreement

23
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:10,720
nor affect your actions.

24
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:12,180
-You can't. -Fengling.

25
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,970
I have a question.

26
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:16,980
Go ahead.

27
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,740
Have you ever thought

28
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,940
why your brother

29
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,140
has been hiding your real identity for so many years?

30
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,880
In fact, you know,

31
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,640
he wants you to avoid

32
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,040
all the danger, right?

33
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,060
Then tell me,

34
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:35,190
do you think your brother is a good brother?

35
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:38,730
He used to be.

36
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:41,130
He hoped I could be

37
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:42,720
a carefree pampered girl.

38
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:44,400
Yes.

39
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,460
Your brother has been carefully

40
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,380
protecting you

41
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,310
as you're his most beloved sister.

42
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,550
And I always treat you

43
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:53,560
as my sister.

44
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,190
We don't want you

45
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,700
to be hurt.

46
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:59,190
But you have hurt me.

47
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:05,150
You have hurt me deeply

48
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,300
when you chose Wu Shuang.

49
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:15,720
I've always treated you

50
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:16,950
as my sister,

51
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,269
and as my good friend.

52
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:21,399
It's different.

53
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,850
I never treat you as a friend.

54
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,010
Actually, we can

55
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:36,860
not be friends.

56
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,030
But don't worry.

57
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,670
I have no intention of pestering you.

58
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,320
I have my pride.

59
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,370
Thank you.

60
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,360
Thank you?

61
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,260
Does Wu Shuang owe me a thank you

62
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,690
or sorry too?

63
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,220
I know.

64
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,050
You don't want to accept Wu Shuang and your brother recognize each other,

65
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,390
because you're afraid of losing

66
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:14,050
your brother who you depend on

67
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,170
I won't let this happen.

68
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:18,020
Neither do I.

69
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,120
So I hope you can leave.

70
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:23,510
This has nothing to do with love.

71
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,250
If you continue to work for Her Ladyship,

72
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:27,890
and stand against us,

73
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,370
and keep causing troubles,

74
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:34,010
I'm afraid your family will be disappointed in the end.

75
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,570
All I did

76
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,090
were just for my family.

77
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:40,040
Do you really fool me like a child?

78
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,250
I'm not Wu Shuang.

79
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,640
I have been educated and I have studied abroad.

80
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,810
I've seen the world.

81
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:47,540
I know the rules of this world.

82
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,060
Natural selection,

83
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,909
survival of the fittest.

84
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,030
This rule fits the creatures' world.

85
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,800
Human society is not necessarily like that.

86
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,000
Aren't humans creatures?

87
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,170
Humans are the most cruel creature

88
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,640
in this world.

89
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,090
The weak are prey to the strong.

90
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:10,310
Even the idiom is created by humans.

91
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:12,360
In this era,

92
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:14,090
having power

93
00:06:14,350 --> 00:06:15,810
is having everything.

94
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,070
Power can't be used to replace family.

95
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,300
Without power,

96
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,440
how can you protect your family?

97
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,810
Look at my brother.

98
00:06:25,010 --> 00:06:26,220
He relied on power

99
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,530
to survive.

100
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:30,930
Fengling,

101
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,730
you've changed.

102
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,300
Yes.

103
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,940
I've changed.

104
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,480
Things have changed. Everyone has changed.

105
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:46,700
Yunqi, let me make it clear.

106
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:49,200
You can't ditch me and my brother.

107
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:53,020
Because each of us has

108
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,450
a Soul Pursuit Order.

109
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:03,920
Luo Jiutian has the Soul Pursuit Order of mountain-demounting?

110
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,570
Yes.

111
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,050
This afternoon,

112
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:11,250
someone took away the Soul Pursuit Order.

113
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,630
It was taken?

114
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:13,730
Yes.

115
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,780
Who took it?

116
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:15,910
Yes.

117
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,750
The young Heaven Official of our Penta-Sect,

118
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:20,450
Ding Yunqi.

119
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:26,970
He's the one who has been impersonating me in Tianjin.

120
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,020
Let's talk about it when I'm in the mood.

121
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,450
I'm tired.

122
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:37,600
Please leave.

123
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,220
He's out.

124
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:18,110
How is it?

125
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,870
She used the Soul Pursuit Order as a condition.

126
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,130
I can only compromise.

127
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,490
That's not the way she can use the Soul Pursuit Order.

128
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:25,290
I'll go find her.

129
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:27,010
Brother, calm down.

130
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:28,780
Impulsion won't solve the problem.

131
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,580
Brother,

132
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:31,760
we can put off getting the Soul Pursuit Order.

133
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:33,780
If we really hurt our sibling's relationship,

134
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,080
it will be more difficult.

135
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,260
If she wants to complain, let her go. We can't spoil her like this.

136
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:38,020
Brother.

137
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,570
Brother,

138
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:41,710
even if you force her to leave today,

139
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:42,640
it's useless.

140
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,390
She said

141
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,030
the Soul Pursuit Order of mountain-demounting

142
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:46,490
is in Luo Jiutian's hands.

143
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,810
Really?

144
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,670
It was Luo Jiutian

145
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,540
who deceived Lord Hao's Soul Pursuit Order.

146
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,810
What brothers and sisters I have!

147
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:00,910
Okay, I'll send my sister away first.

148
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,170
Then I'll teach my brother a lesson.

149
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,050
Brother,

150
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,850
you're using violence against violence.

151
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:05,740
If you do it,

152
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,370
Fengling won't realize her problem.

153
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:09,890
She will only fall deeper and deeper with power.

154
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:10,890
Then what can I do?

155
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,730
Are we just going to let her be?

156
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,140
Brother,

157
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,820
to be honest,

158
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,880
your siblings are both troublesome.

159
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:19,570
Young Master.

160
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:22,430
Senior Jiang is here.

161
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,340
Under the order of Sect Leader,

162
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:26,990
please go to Mound-Digging to pay your respects.

163
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,120
We are having a funeral for the former Sect Leader today.

164
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,400
Okay.

165
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:45,930
[R.I.P]

166
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,680
Disciples of Mound-Digging,

167
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,800
kneel down.

168
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,290
The white horse and vehicle are sorrow like a dream.

169
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,060
In the blue sky and the sea is summoning the soul.

170
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,930
It is the day for the spirit leaves.

171
00:10:23,950 --> 00:10:26,010
But the Heroic Spirit is still there.

172
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:28,290
Raise the flag to lead the way.

173
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:30,730
Smash tiles!

174
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,270
Release the spirit.

175
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,400
The Heavenly Gate is open. The mountain is long.

176
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,160
The Black Dragon stirs the sea.

177
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,080
Help me up to Qingyang.

178
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,040
Penta-Sect disciples are returning to the mountain.

179
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,350
Demons dodge.

180
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,000
Penta-Sect disciples are returning to the mountain.

181
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:54,720
Demons dodge.

182
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,730
Penta-Sect disciples are returning to the mountain, demons dodge.

183
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,810
Master.

184
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,750
Let's go home.

185
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:03,920
Master.

186
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,480
Let's go home.

187
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,480
Master.

188
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,350
Let's go home.

189
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,480
Wu Shuang!

190
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,800
Yunqi.

191
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,690
Go back first.

192
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,260
I want to be alone with Master.

193
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:15,920
Okay.

194
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:18,770
I'll wait for you at the headquarters.

195
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,370
Master.

196
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,640
I found my brother.

197
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,910
Luo Yunsong is my brother.

198
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,870
Feng Ling is my sister.

199
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,930
I have brothers and sisters, master.

200
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,310
I finally know whose daughter I am.

201
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,350
But Master,

202
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,270
I'm not happy.

203
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,100
Master.

204
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,300
I don't know what to do

205
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:24,690
♫ Toss the coin into the blind box ♫

206
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:32,280
♫I won't tell which side is up♫

207
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:39,830
♫Fear of spoilers will reveal the results♫

208
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,210
♫Fear of being vulnerable♫

209
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:54,950
♫Entanglement is the cocoon of confinement♫

210
00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:01,740
♫Intuition is the direction of courage♫

211
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:07,200
♫Not that I don't miss you♫

212
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:11,300
♫But it's time to let go♫

213
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:12,450
Wu Shuang.

214
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:18,650
♫Not letting go will cause injury♫

215
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,610
Perfect.

216
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:28,530
♫Give me the strength to break free from the cocoon♫

217
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:36,050
♫Together we step towards the horizon for the sunset♫

218
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,980
♫No matter how much wind and sand I endure♫

219
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,150
♫To break the shackles of the net♫

220
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:50,740
♫Oh♫

221
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:59,390
♫I'll just spare a smile♫

222
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,180
Silly girl.

223
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,760
What is home for?

224
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,330
Home is a place of shelter and someone to help you when you are in trouble

225
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,660
with someone to help you

226
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,780
when you are in trouble, isn't it?

227
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,330
Life is hard.

228
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,550
Look.

229
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,100
We work so hard

230
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,080
to find happiness

231
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,600
in the midst of hard work.

232
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,720
If you find it,

233
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,410
then grab it tightly.

234
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,840
Don't let go.

235
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,480
But I hope

236
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,290
you can have your own home.

237
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:02,820
A small but real home what belongs to you.

238
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:03,870
Master.

239
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:06,890
Don't give up.

240
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,040
Wu Shuang.

241
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,200
Why are you sitting here alone?

242
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:22,350
I remembered something in the past.

243
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:31,270
Seeing you sitting here,

244
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:33,350
I also think of master.

245
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,850
But we still have to move forward.

246
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,280
Sister,

247
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:04,180
help me to gather seniors and juniors

248
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,440
for me.

249
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,940
I have something to say.

250
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,620
Wu Shuang.

251
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:17,040
Seeing that you can take care of Mound-Digging,

252
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,030
I'm so happy.

253
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:14,910
Sister.

254
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,850
Sister.

255
00:20:20,580 --> 00:20:21,710
Did she tell you

256
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,660
why she asked us to come over?

257
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,570
No.

258
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:27,860
How did she look like,

259
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,310
when she called us?

260
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,610
Was she angry?

261
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,260
Did she tell you anything?

262
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,230
No.

263
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,270
Hua Xingchen,

264
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,870
are you still from Mound-Digging?

265
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,860
I am.

266
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:46,850
Fine.

267
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,220
Now Sect Leader has an order,

268
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:51,470
how come you have so many questions?

269
00:20:56,950 --> 00:20:58,590
I just think more,

270
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,940
it's also good for our future, right?

271
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,210
Hua Xingchen,

272
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:05,590
don't try to confuse me with these words.

273
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,290
I've figured it out.

274
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:11,480
You're the Emperor Qi in the opera.

275
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:13,710
You go to smart but ugly women when there is trouble,

276
00:21:13,710 --> 00:21:15,430
and you go to beauties when everything is fine.

277
00:21:15,430 --> 00:21:17,230
What are you talking about? I...

278
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:19,750
I didn't fall in love with another woman.

279
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:21,730
Isn't the position of Sect Leader

280
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:23,280
your smart but ugly woman.

281
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,390
Everyone is here.

282
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:35,170
I have something to announce.

283
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:42,520
In terms of age,

284
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,250
in terms of experience,

285
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:46,840
I am not qualified to be Sect Leader.

286
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:48,310
But

287
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:49,990
master's last wish

288
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,060
is that I take over the position of Sect Leader.

289
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,990
I can't disobey my master's order.

290
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,090
I will take the responsibility of Mound-Digging.

291
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,200
Have a seat.

292
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,700
Now,

293
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:18,300
I'll announce the first decision

294
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,430
after I take over.

295
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,340
Penta-Sect has been disbanded.

296
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,990
From now on,

297
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,480
there is no need for the disciples of Penta-Sect to abide the rules.

298
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,910
Those who have parents and relatives,

299
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:39,470
you can meet them yourself.

300
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,950
If you have a partner,

301
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:44,040
you can get married too.

302
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,780
If your girlfriend marries you,

303
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,510
I'll give you a betrothal gift.

304
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,370
If you marry your boyfriend,

305
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,900
Mound-Digging will also give you some dowry.

306
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,020
But

307
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,800
the other rules of Mound-Digging are still the same.

308
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,620
If you do something evil,

309
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,280
and disgrace Mound-Digging,

310
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:08,750
you will be severely punished.

311
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,520
Yes, Sect Leader.

312
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,640
Yes, Sect Leader.

313
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,040
Everyone,

314
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,550
there is one more thing we must do.

315
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,970
Master was killed by Tian Long.

316
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:32,090
Tian Long is the mortal enemy

317
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:33,520
of Mound-Digging.

318
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,050
We are greatly indebted to Master.

319
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:39,530
Even if we have to risk our lives,

320
00:23:39,530 --> 00:23:40,910
we must kill Tian Long

321
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:43,180
to console master's spirit.

322
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:47,300
We'll do as you say. We're waiting for your dispatch.

323
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:48,930
Okay.

324
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,300
We don't know where Tian Long is now.

325
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,780
But he wants to stay in Kunlun Mountains.

326
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:57,840
He will follow Ding Yunqi and his men.

327
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,110
I plan to

328
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,500
leave with them

329
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,620
and lure out Tian Long

330
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:06,190
to avenge my master.

331
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,870
Sect Leader,

332
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,390
take me with you.

333
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:11,910
Although I'm weak in martial arts,

334
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,250
I can still do my best

335
00:24:16,550 --> 00:24:17,740
To lure and kill Tian Long

336
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,270
is not just about the crowd.

337
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:20,410
Sister,

338
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,410
you stay here

339
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,760
and practice with your brothers.

340
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,120
If I fail,

341
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:29,630
even if there's only one person left in Mound-Digging,

342
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:31,150
we swear to kill Tian Long!

343
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:38,160
Kill Tian Long! Kill Tian Long!

344
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:45,870
Senior Jiang!

345
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,120
Sect Leader.

346
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,910
After I left,

347
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,810
the business and affairs in Mound-Digging

348
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,370
are still in your hands.

349
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:54,960
Yes.

350
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,760
Senior Hua.

351
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,410
Yes.

352
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,690
I'll leave everything in headquarters

353
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,520
to you.

354
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:11,880
If I die,

355
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:16,190
you will be the next Sect Leader.

356
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:18,980
Wu Shuang.

357
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,210
Sect Leader,

358
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,520
are you telling the truth?

359
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:29,310
In front of so many seniors and juniors,

360
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,670
of course I'm serious.

361
00:25:32,010 --> 00:25:33,640
Everyone here can testify.

362
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,180
Senior Hua,

363
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:37,580
I trust you.

364
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,130
If I don't come back,

365
00:25:40,850 --> 00:25:43,110
you'll take good care of Mound-Digging.

366
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,560
You

367
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,370
don't blame me?

368
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:51,400
We grew up together.

369
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,400
I believe you.

370
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:01,960
I'll take good care of Mound-Digging for you, Sect Leader.

371
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,090
Everyone here

372
00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:12,730
were orphans brought to Mound-Digging by master.

373
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,620
We are greatly indebted to Mound-Digging.

374
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,950
I hope all of you

375
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:20,530
can help each other,

376
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,440
take care of yourself,

377
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,020
and protect Mound-Digging.

378
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,150
Yes, Sect Leader.

379
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:30,250
Yes, Sect Leader.

380
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,920
I didn't expect

381
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,790
you to be still interested in this kind of thing.

382
00:27:00,570 --> 00:27:02,720
This reminds me

383
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:05,470
you're still a delicate girl.

384
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,590
No.

385
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:10,340
I'm the Sect Leader of Mound-Digging now.

386
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,240
I don't want you to be that.

387
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,330
Are you done?

388
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:22,500
Let's talk.

389
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,140
Sure.

390
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,620
But I want to go somewhere first.

391
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:32,970
Okay, I'll be with you wherever you want to go.

392
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:38,060
I want to go back to our matrimonial home to have a look.

393
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,100
Okay.

394
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,660
♫Don't cry♫

395
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,520

418

In just a few days,

419
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,290
everything has changed.

420
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,250
It's like a dream.

421
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,740
At least it's a good memory

422
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:51,550
of a lifetime.

423
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:57,700
♫Close your eyes to realize♫

424
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,830

00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:56,900
I will never forget it.

436
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,060
That day, when I was standing here

437
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:03,370
to marry you,

438
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,070
I secretly made a wish to God

439
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:10,770
that we could stay on Mound-Digging Region forever

440
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:13,070
and never care about Penta-Sect,

441
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:13,910
Tian Long,

442
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,480
or the Kunlun Mountains.

443
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,280
I understand.

444
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:31,090
I also want to

445
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,890
keep you company forever.

446
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,210
But God forbids us to be willful.

447
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:06,660
Yes.

448
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,400
Wu Shuang,

449
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:13,640
don't be willful.

450
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,370
Give me the Soul Pursuit Order.

451
00:32:22,250 --> 00:32:23,040
No.

452
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:26,030
Stop being naughty.

453
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:26,990
I'm not.

454
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,500
I know you want me to stay here.

455
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,950
But I won't promise you.

456
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:37,570
I asked you to stay

457
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,370
because I don't want you to take the risk with me.

458
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:44,550
Tian Long has appeared.

459
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,240
You'll be in danger

460
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,620
if you stay with me.

461
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,590
His target is me.

462
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:51,350
Be good.

463
00:32:51,810 --> 00:32:52,810
He will only leave

464
00:32:53,030 --> 00:32:53,950
when I'm gone.

465
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:56,610
I'm not afraid of danger.

466
00:32:57,310 --> 00:32:58,700
Tian Long is my enemy.

467
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,760
I want to avenge my master.

468
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,640
I know.

469
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,400
He is also my enemy.

470
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,040
I will

471
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,550
take revenge for us.

472
00:33:06,550 --> 00:33:07,270
No.

473
00:33:09,790 --> 00:33:11,170
I'll kill him myself.

474
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,540
Besides, Tian Long's martial arts are unfathomable.

475
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,470
You need me.

476
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,480
What I need is that I have no worries in the future.

477
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:21,220
I'll only be at ease if you stay.

478
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,660
I'll be back

479
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,600
when I'm done with the Kunlun Mountains' affairs.

480
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,730
I will, definitely.

481
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,100
How long will it take to get the Kunlun Mountains' affairs done?

482
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,230
One year, two years?

483
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:35,680
Five years, ten years?

484
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,300
Or your whole life?

485
00:33:42,590 --> 00:33:44,920
If I am alive, I will definitely come back;

486
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:47,380
if I die unfortunately, I will miss you forever.

487
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:48,760
You read this for me

488
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:50,440
when we got married.

489
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,930
I've engraved it in my heart.

490
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,270
I told you that

491
00:33:55,990 --> 00:33:57,590
our lives are tied together.

492
00:33:58,550 --> 00:33:59,560
If you live,

493
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:00,940
I will live.

494
00:34:02,120 --> 00:34:02,960
If you die,

495
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,720
I'll die.

496
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,440
No.

497
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,490
I just want you to live.

498
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:11,110
Yunqi.

499
00:34:12,030 --> 00:34:13,500
Master has passed away.

500
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:14,840
If you leave me again,

501
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,420
I'm no different from a walking corpse.

502
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:19,670
Then I won't be happy.

503
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,610
Has Fengling left?

504
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:38,989
I guess

505
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,480
you and Luo Yunsong didn't send Fengling away

506
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,489
because she threatened you

507
00:34:43,489 --> 00:34:45,090
with the Soul Pursuit Order?

508
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,110
This...

509
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:49,620
Is it related to you?

510
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:50,800
Of course.

511
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:52,900
Now I am one who has

512
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:54,560
the most Soul Pursuit Orders.

513
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:56,300
I have Heaven Official's,

514
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,700
Mound-Digging's and mountain-moving's three Soul Pursuit Orders.

515
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,370
Yunqi,

516
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,640
you have no bargaining chip.

517
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,430
I know.

518
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,620
I know you're worried about me.

519
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,670
But don't worry.

520
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,350
I will protect myself well.

521
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,370
I have someone I love

522
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:23,110
and someone who loves me.

523
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:24,730
I cherish my life.

524
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:28,990
Brother.

525
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:41,360
Yunqi.

526
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,530
What are you doing here, Wu Shuang?

527
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,810
Wu Shuang is coming with us.

528
00:36:55,110 --> 00:36:55,870
Really?

529
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:57,690
That’s great! Very good!

530
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,400
Brother Luo,

531
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:02,590
I didn't come here

532
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,050
because I changed my mind.

533
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:05,940
I hope you can understand.

534
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:12,630
I understand.

535
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:14,220
Actually,

536
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,610
I should apologize to you.

537
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,460
I was too impatient.

538
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,400
I didn't consider

539
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,530
your feelings from your perspective.

540
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:24,810
I was wrong

541
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,330
in the past.

542
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,180
I was helpless too.

543
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,530
Now,

544
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,420
I just hope my parents

545
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,730
can bless me to live longer.

546
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:36,610
In this way,

547
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:39,020
I'll make it up to you later.

548
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,220
Don't worry, Wu Shuang.

549
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,150
I won't pressure you anymore.

550
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:12,310
Fengling

551
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,620
hasn't adapted to it yet, so...

552
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:18,860
It's okay.

553
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:19,780
I don't care.

554
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,460
Don't be so nervous.

555
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,300
Relax.

556
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:30,200
There are things we can let go,

557
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:31,660
but for some other things,

558
00:38:31,850 --> 00:38:33,710
we have to ask for an explanation.

559
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,650
Brother,

560
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,920
what are you doing?

561
00:38:37,930 --> 00:38:38,720
Biao!

562
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:40,950
Brother.

563
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:42,910
Can you find Jiutian?

564
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,860
It was me who taught Jiutian both tracking and stealth skills.

565
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,250
It's not hard to find him when I know he's nearby.

566
00:38:47,250 --> 00:38:48,300
Bring him to me.

567
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,100
Yes.

568
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,820
We need to talk to Fengling again.

569
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,320
I'll go find her.
