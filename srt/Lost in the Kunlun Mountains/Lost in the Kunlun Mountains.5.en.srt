Ms. Fengling.

5
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:45,500
Hello, Yunqi.

6
00:01:46,509 --> 00:01:47,979
We met in a hurry yesterday.

7
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,320
We didn't have chance to say hello.

8
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,550
So I invited you to come here

9
00:01:52,009 --> 00:01:52,890
to have a chat.

10
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,009
I've ordered.

11
00:01:57,509 --> 00:01:58,229
Thank you.

12
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,330
You're welcome.

13
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,050
I'm talking about the thing happened last night.

14
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:04,650
It's over.

15
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,700
Don't mention it again.

16
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,990
You studied medicine in England?

17
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,330
Yes.

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,840
Sir, your coffee.

19
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:14,860
That's a good job.

20
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,510
I learned world history in America.

21
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,190
But I couldn't make any contributions when I came back.

22
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,110
How long

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,329
have you been back?

24
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,090
I just came back.

25
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,780
I know a few friends who're doctors of Western medicine.

26
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,750
Do you want to meet them?

27
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:34,470
Not for now.

28
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:36,200
I want to finish these chores

29
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,790
before handling work.

30
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,950
I can understand.

31
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,590
You...

32
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,890
You don't talk much.

33
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,700
No.

34
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,800
I just have many questions.

35
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,210
Do you think

36
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,560
we are friends now?

37
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:07,610
No.

38
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,420
The person who saved you can't be your friend either?

39
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,280
I can't say it.

40
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,670
It's complicated.

41
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,710
Okay.

42
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,690
I'll try to understand.

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,040
When you think we're friends,

44
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,590
I'll tell you everything.

45

are not weapons, right?

82
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,310
It's a western musical instrument, a violin.

83

You're smart. You know everything.

there was a place like home in the world

98
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,870
was when I went to your home when I was a child.

My mother was gone at that time.

It was quiet and comfortable.

You didn't worry about making mistakes.

104

Your father was solicitous.

105

That was great.

106
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,290
I didn't want my master to pick me up.

107

I wanted to stay at your home forever.

108

Did your master treat you badly?

109

No. My master is nice to me.

It's rare to come out for a walk.

They're at Little East Gate.

They went back to Waixiangua Street.

You can see it?

128
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:19,590
I can see it.

129

This is so uncomfortable.

130
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,100
Let me tell you.

131
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,650
Our juniors' tracking ability

132
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,870
needs to be improved.

133
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,720
They'll be discovered if they stay so close.

134
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:32,679
How did you

135
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,030
help our master teach them?

136
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:35,080
No matter how well they performed,

137
00:08:35,289 --> 00:08:36,380
they would still be discovered by you.

138
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,650
I just let them practice.

139
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,169
You're not confined?

140
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,360
Master asked me

141
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,320
to make amends.

142
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,960
What do you mean?

143
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,390
Did he ask you to take me back?

144
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,370
He was afraid something would happen to you,

145
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,930
so he asked me to help you at the critical moment.

146
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,790
Master is so nice.

147
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:00,020
You're nice too.

148
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:00,820
Of course.

149
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:02,920
All right.

150
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:05,020
I think there won't be any critical moments.

151
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,570
Young Master Ding has regained his freedom.

152
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,620

155
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:11,240
Please tell Master

156
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,790
I'll go back and be punished

157
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,220
when I get the dragon bone back.

158
00:09:14,550 --> 00:09:15,390
Where will you go back?

159
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,860

160
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:18,170
Mound-digging.

00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,190
You two are engaged.

162
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,880
From now on, you have to travel the martial artists community together.

163

Why are you going back to Mound-digging?

164

What?

165

Don't mention it.

166
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,600
What do you mean?

167
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,360
What do you mean?

168
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,660
You want to be a matrilocal son-in-law?

169
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,470
No way.

170
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:36,350
That's impossible.

171
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,320
Think about it.

172
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,790
You two are always together.

173
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,130
What would other juniors and seniors think?

174
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,500
I'll talk to your master.

175
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,930
No need.

176
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:47,310
What?

177
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,660
Oh no.

178
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:50,590
What's wrong?

00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:17,930
Let's go.

182
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:21,630
How could Luo Yunsong let you go?

183
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,190
I was saved.

184
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:25,950
Who saved you?

185
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,130
His family member.

186
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,210
Luo Yunsong caught you.

187
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,770
Then his family member released you.

188
00:10:36,830 --> 00:10:38,340
Do you get along with his family member?

189
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,480
It's a long story.

190
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:42,790
Uncle, I'm here today

191
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,020
to talk about my engagement to Wu Shuang.

192
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,200
Come here.

193
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,670
Sit down.

194
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,750
This matter

195
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:55,730
shouldn't be discussed by you.

196
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:57,870
Well...

197
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,220
You're a young man of a new era.

198
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,410
Let's not talk about the rules.

199
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,180
Did you get the dragon bone back?

200
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:06,650
No, I didn't.

201
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,760
I didn't know the dragon bone could be

202
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,350
taken as the bride-price.

203
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,370
So this is a misunderstanding.

204
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,340
I want to explain it to you.

205
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:18,580
Misunderstanding?

206
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:19,880
What misunderstanding is it?

207
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,990

00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:24,670

You

211
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,870
are engaged abroad?

212
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,310
No.

213
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,910
No, then...

214
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:38,320
Wu Shuang's

215
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,260
appearance, personality

216
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:42,600
and martial arts

217
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,280
are the best.

218
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,040
Why she wasn't worthy of you?

219
00:11:46,590 --> 00:11:47,510
That's not what I meant.

220
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,700
Give me a reason.

221
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,380
The reason is

222
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,230
I won't take over as Heaven Official.

223
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,130
You won't take over as Heaven Official?

224
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,380
I hope you can understand.

225
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:05,740
I don't understand.

226
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,400
I don't want to be the Heaven Official.

227
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,740
Uncle,

228
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,630
I don't want to join the Penta-sect either.

229
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,990
You know

230
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:17,210
the situation of the Penta-sect.

231
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:19,520
What your father did

232
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,530
can't let him stay in the martial artists community

233
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:22,830
and Penta-sect.

234
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,270
So,

235
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,950
for the dignity of the Ding family,

236
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:28,800
the responsibility of the Penta-sect

237
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,610
is on you now.

238
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,830
No matter for what reason,

239
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:35,770
you have to take over as Heaven Official.

240
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,540
You've known my father for so many years.

241
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,810
I believe you know my father well.

242
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,900
He's not a traitor.

243
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,950
You...

244
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,600
How long has it been since you last saw your father?

245
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,370
Six years.

246
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:55,470
Six years.

247
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:58,410
It's possible for him to betray us six times

248
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:00,260
during the six years.

249
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,400
Yunqi.

250
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,710
You're too young.

251
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:05,930
You don't know people well.

252
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:08,780
Uncle,

253
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,630
my father even sacrificed my mother

254
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,810
for the sake of the Penta-sect.

255
00:13:11,970 --> 00:13:14,070
I don't believe there's anyone who're more loyal than my father.

256
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,130
How can you explain what happened in the Kunlun Mountains?

257
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:25,830
The Kunlun Mountains

258
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,100
is the foundation of the Penta-sect.

259
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,370
It doesn't belong to the Ding family.

260
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:32,720
Your father has no right to give it to others.

261
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,160
When I find my father,

262
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,960
the truth will be revealed.

263
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:43,350
The Penta-sect has a thousand years of history.

264
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,740
It's a sect with foundation.

265
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,210
It can't be destroyed

266
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,640
by our generation.

267
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:49,980
Yes.

268
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:51,750
It can't be destroyed by you.

269
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,720
It can be destroyed by me.

270
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:55,950
There are many out-dated rules in the Penta-sect.

271
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,210
They're not worth being kept.

272
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:01,450
What did you say?

273
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:04,560
I said I want to disband the Penta-sect.

274
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:09,850
In this era,

275
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,280
there is no need for the Penta-sect

276
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,000
to exist.

277
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,580
Ding Yunqi!

278
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,430
Okay.

279
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,250
Yunqi.

280
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:02,560
If you take over as Heaven Official,

281
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,410
I'll promise you two things.

282
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,470
First,

283
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,280
I'll help you get the dragon bone back

284
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,700
and find your father.

285
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:12,260
Second,

286
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,230
when I find your father,

287
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,370
I won't kill him.

288
00:15:16,710 --> 00:15:17,970
I'll only punish him.

289
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,200
I'll confine him in Mound-digging Region

290
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,750
for the rest of his life.

291
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,530
For the future of the Penta-sect,

292
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,930
I'll keep my promise.

293
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:31,580
Uncle,

294
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:33,680
I've told you many times.

295
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,650
My father is still alive.

296
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:38,470
He's the Heaven Official. I'm not the Heaven Official.

297
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,270
I don't want to be the Heaven Official.

298
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,600
Let me ask you again.

299
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,840
Are you going to take over as Heaven Official or not?

300
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,520
No.

301
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,400
Fine.

302
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,080
If so,

303
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,720
hand over dragon bones

304
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,190
and Dragon sceptres.

305
00:16:03,450 --> 00:16:04,630
They belong to the Penta-sect,

306
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,230
not yours.

307
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,240
They're my father's belongings.

308
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,220
I have to keep them

309
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,810
before I find him.

310
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,620
You won't hand them over?

311
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,630
No.

312
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:20,340
Go and persuade him.

313
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,610
I can't

314
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,080
persuade both of them.

315
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,720
What should we do if they fight?

316
00:16:26,810 --> 00:16:28,570
We can't stop Ding Yunqi.

317
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,170
Xuewen, I'm leaving.

318
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:33,020
If Master found me, I couldn't escape.

319
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,200
You can't run.

320
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,500
You can't run.

321
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,100
Ding Yunqi just said

322
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,320
your engagement is a misunderstanding.

323
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,380
I know what to do.

324
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:42,430
I'm leaving.

325
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:43,520
Don't go.

326
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:47,300
You rejected the engagement to Wu Shuang

327
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,190
and refused to be the Heaven Official

328
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,460
and hand over the things of the Penta-sect.

329
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:53,730
Ding Yunqi.

330
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,160
What do you want?

331
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:59,060
What do you want?

332
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,680
Do you take here as a place you can go freely?

333
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,630
Do you think no one in the Penta-sect can handle you?

334
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,599
Guys,

335
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,780
are you ready to set up a formation?

336
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,230
You don't have to die.

337
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,750
That day at the dock,

338
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:29,090
I let you off.

339
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,740
Do you really think you won?

340
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:35,050
It was a narrow escape.

341
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,960
If I won today,

342
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,600
Uncle,

343
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,320
would you disband the Penta-sect?

344
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,310
Of course not.

345
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,530
Look.

346
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,810
No matter who won,

347
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:59,500
we couldn't change our minds.

348
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:00,630
So,

349
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,530
you can't solve everything with force.

350
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,220
It can only solve temporary problems at most.

351
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,030
Since I came back to Shanghai,

352
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:11,800
I've never stopped fighting.

353
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,570
I'm tired.

354
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,730
Don't you want to find your father earlier?

355
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,760
You want to kill or confine him.

356
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:24,910
But I want to find him

357
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:27,970
and help him clear his name.

358
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,030
I don't need the kiss of death.

359
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:32,350
Uncle.

360
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:33,910
See you.

361
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,430
♫Close your eyes to realize♫

362
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:16,170
♫Wind and rain are actually gifts♫

363
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:23,350
♫The sky cleared with the help of light♫

364
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,550
♫It finally put together♫

365
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:33,620
♫A different rainbow puzzle♫

366
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,760
♫We promised♫

367
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:40,800
♫To be happy♫

368
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,760
♫I'll protect you♫

369
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,860
♫Unrestrained♫

370
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:54,620
♫We promised even if I had to give my all♫

371
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,780
♫I would♫

372
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,010
♫I would♫

373

♫Go with you♫

374
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:21,490
You're back.

375
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,750
Wash your hands.

376
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,780
I don't know where San Jin is.

377
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:32,920
We really need someone to cook at home.

378
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,860
Where is the oil?

379
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,030
When will San Jin come back?

380
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,640
He left.

381
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,470
What do you mean?

382
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,730
Where did he go?

383
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:47,910
Luo Yunsong

384
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,840
said my father killed three of his family members.

385
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,570
He wanted my whole family to pay with our lives.

386
00:20:53,290 --> 00:20:55,050
I was afraid he would count San Jin.

387
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:58,450
No way.

388
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,980
It's not easy for San Jin to survive.

389
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:04,420
I asked Brother to send him out of this city

390
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:05,930
and let him live a good life.

391
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:13,110
Did your father really kill three of Luo Yunsong's family members?

392
00:21:14,830 --> 00:21:15,630
Do you believe it?

393
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,810
No, I don't.

394
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,870
When did you come back?

395
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:22,900
How did you win

396
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:24,280
the formation set up by my juniors?

397
00:21:25,710 --> 00:21:26,510
We didn't fight.

398
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,430
I won the argument.

399
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:30,620
You won the argument?

400
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:34,070
No.

401
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:36,710
Ding Yunqi,

402
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,350
you won the argument?

403
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:41,750
You can win a fight, but you must lose an argument.

404
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,600
My master always says right.

405
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:46,540
Yes. Your master is always right.

406
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:47,800
Then why did you come to the bell tower

407
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,020
instead of listening to him?

408
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,320
You...

409
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,750
I...

410
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,510
I...

411
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,120
You questioned me?

412
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,810
Remember, my master is always right.

413
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,300
Here.

414
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:14,980
Be careful.

415
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,870
Let's go.

416
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:24,470
Master.

417
00:22:26,230 --> 00:22:27,490
How is it going inside?

418
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,720
The work inside went well.

419
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:32,280
And the location is very accurate. We didn't make a detour.

420
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,130
We took all valuable things.

421
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:36,440
Things with less value were not moved.

422
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:37,780
Get to the point.

423
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:42,570
Master.

424
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,890
It was found in the southeast corner of the tomb.

425
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:48,910
Also,

426
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,090
there was a clear spiral knife pattern in the tomb.

427
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,070
It should be...

428
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,420
Ghoul?

429
00:22:59,590 --> 00:23:01,070
Ghoul has been changed to escort agency.

430
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,250
They haven't gone down to tombs for decades.

431
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,900
Why did they suddenly take action?

432
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:11,090
Look at the feng shui and the tomb.

433
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,280
It's not a high official.

434
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:16,290
There might not be

435
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,810
rare treasures inside.

436
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,890
He came all the way to Shanghai.

437
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,610
He still had time

438
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,210
to come here.

439
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,130
Master.

440
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:31,190
Sun Sanxuan broke the Xunfeng Formation

441
00:23:31,290 --> 00:23:32,580
and ran away with Ding Yunqi's help.

442
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,510
I think

443
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,200
we should tell Luo Yunsong about this.

444
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,750
Then Hua Xingchen and Xiao Liuzi

445
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,760
can come back.

446
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,690
We can also kill Sun Sanxuan.

447
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:41,190
What are you talking about?

448
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,610
It's a legal clean-up.

449
00:23:46,450 --> 00:23:49,010
Sun Sanxuan is a traitor.

450
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,900
But if you let him

451
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:52,750
become a scapegoat

452
00:23:53,290 --> 00:23:54,890
and told the government about it,

453
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,110
what would be the difference

454
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:57,410
between you and Luo Yunsong?

455
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:01,820
Don't forget your origin.

456
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,330
You can't forget justice

457
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,550
because of personal grudges.

458
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:06,480
-Yes. -Yes, Master.

459
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,890
It's almost done. Let's eat.

460
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,340
Where are you going?

461
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,640
The last dish is ready.

462
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,450
Come on. Sit down.

463
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,190
It's time to eat.

464
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,680
Look.

465
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:59,400
They're good in color, aroma and taste.

466
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,470
This is my first time cooking.

467
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:04,610
You must be honored.

468
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,370
Here.

469
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:08,680
This

470
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,870
is your first time cooking?

471
00:25:13,010 --> 00:25:14,140
So talented.

472
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:15,150
Try it.

473
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:18,090
Gosh.

474
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:19,980
I'm so talented.

475
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,210
The color looks light.

476
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:26,910
Isn't it good?

477
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,130
Yes.

478
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,230
Don't you have a strong taste?

479
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,700
So I added a lot of soy sauce.

480
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,710
Come on. Try the meat.

481
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,020
How is it?

482
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:45,640
Is it delicious and tender?

483
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:47,240
It's delicious.

484
00:25:56,730 --> 00:25:57,490
Brother.

485
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:08,570
Is there Tush today?

486
00:26:14,790 --> 00:26:15,750
What's wrong?

487
00:26:16,090 --> 00:26:17,690
Are you still mad at me?

488
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,160
Didn't we make it clear?

489
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,890
Brother.

490
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,130
Show me your Certificate of Appointment given by Her Ladyship.

491
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:29,490
You knew it?

492
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:40,700
[Certificate of Appointment]

493
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,020
I appoint Chu Fengling

494
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:41,250
as a special member of the Secret Investigation Team of the Kunlun Mountains.

495
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,600
People in the Black Feather Team are members of the investigation team.

496
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,450
Officials at all levels should actively cooperate.

497
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:47,550
She can deploy the police when necessary.

498
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,080
Not bad.

499
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,310
Now you're your brother's superior.

500
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,580
Brother.

501
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,140
You didn't want to leave this morning

502
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,280
because you were waiting for it, right?

503
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:07,880
No.

504
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:09,390
I didn't expect

505
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,110
Her Ladyship would suddenly appoint me to this position.

506
00:27:12,370 --> 00:27:13,000
Brother,

507
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,550
you don't believe me?

508
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:22,530
We have the same goal.

509
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,880
Let's work together.

510
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,900
We have different goals.

511
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,880
Your target is the Kunlun Mountains.

512
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:41,260
My target is

513
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,690
Ding Yuanshan.

514
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:50,590
Right.

515
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,980
Find Ding Yuanshan or Ding Yunqi

516
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,450
and then open the Kunlun Mountains.

517
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:56,380
No.

518
00:27:57,810 --> 00:27:58,440
What's wrong?

519
00:27:58,570 --> 00:27:59,580
Everything is wrong.

520
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:03,440
You are now

521
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,960
a special member of the Special Investigation Team of the Kunlun Mountains.

522
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,270
The Black Feather Team is under your control.

523
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,400
Why do you think it's right?

524
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,600
I've thought about it.

525
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,610
The Black Feather Team was incorporated

526
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:15,960
in a public institution.

527
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,140
Her Ladyship also promised to give the most advanced weapons

528
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,530
to the Black Feather Team.

529
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,210
Brother, I don't want the Black Feather Team.

530
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,810
That's your team.

531
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,030
I just wanted to take this opportunity

532
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,660
to give the Black Feather Team an identity.

533
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,640
I meant well.

534
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,400
I felt wronged.

535
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:36,950
[Yun Song.]

536
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,080
[The Kunlun Mountains is the wealth of the Kuomintang. No matter what your plan is, let me remind you.]

537
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:46,470
[You should focus on the interests of the Kuomintang. I'll leave this matter to Fengling. The Black Feather Team will be deployed by Fengling for the time being.]

538
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:47,620
[I'll also appoint Fengling as a secret investigator of the Kunlun Mountains. Please cooperate. Chen Yu.]

539
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:50,770
It's just a suggestion.

540
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:52,450
You are too sensitive.

541
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:54,470
Her Ladyship knows you're catching Ding Yuanshan,

542
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,320
so she wants us

543
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,580
to work together.

544
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,740
Fengling.

545
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,800
I

546
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,080
really don't want you to go into politics.

547
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,180
I want. I like it.

548
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:11,350
What should I do?

549
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:12,910
Brother,

550
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,750
I planned to discuss it with you

551
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,390
when I come back tonight.

552
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:18,070
I didn't expect Her Ladyship took action so fast.

553
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,280
She gave me the Certificate of Appointment as soon as we met.

554
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,680
Brother.

555
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,070
Don't be angry.

556
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:35,330
Does it hurt a lot?

557
00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:38,060
Do you want to spit it out?

558
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,300
There are no doctors nearby.

559
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,820
What should we do?

560
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,540
Bring me the medicine box.

561
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,980
Right. I forgot you're a doctor.

562
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,040
Which one?

563
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,780
It's hot.

564
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,580
Seriously.

565
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,560
You shouldn't eat so much even if they were delicious.

566
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:10,540
Just stop here.

567
00:31:11,050 --> 00:31:11,760
Okay.

568
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,820
[Zhu's Wonton]

569
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:24,910
Young Master, I'm back.

570
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,250
Ms. Wu Shuang.

571
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:27,510
You're back.

572
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,160
Young Master.

573
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:32,470
Young Master.

574
00:31:33,390 --> 00:31:34,150
What...

575
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,110
What happened?

576
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,420
He's not feeling well.

577
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:39,650
Why?

578
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,840
Stomachache. He just took some medicine.

579
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,820
What did you have for dinner?

580
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:45,950
Dinner?

581
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,090
There's something left over there. I cooked dinner.

582
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:50,020
Do you want some? Look.

583
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,930
You let Young Master eat these tonight?

584
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,490
He ate a lot. He said they were delicious.

585
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,620
You cooked them?

586
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:59,180
Yes.

587
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:00,900
You haven't eaten, have you? I'll heat them up for you.

588
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,700
Stop!

589
00:32:03,290 --> 00:32:04,090
You poisoned Young Master.

590
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:05,060
Do you know it?

591
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,280
Poison?

592
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,010
How can they be poisonous?

593
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,150
Nonsense! How can I be fine after eating them?

594
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:13,670
Don't you know Young Master is allergic to mushrooms?

595
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,690
Leave here.

596
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:17,530
This...

597
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:18,710
-How could they be poisonous? -Leave here.

598
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,970
They can't be poisonous.

599
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:20,890
Get out!

600
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:37,250
Stop!

601
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:39,180
Go back.

602
00:33:40,230 --> 00:33:41,490
I want to get him a glass of water.

603
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:42,450
Go back.

604
00:33:43,130 --> 00:33:44,090
Don't come here again.

605
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,780
Is it really because of my food?

606
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,830
Of course.

607
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,390
As long as I left home,

608
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,280
you almost killed Young Master.

609
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,970
Can you live without me?

610
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,110
No. We need you.

611
00:34:07,570 --> 00:34:08,199
Listen.

612
00:34:08,370 --> 00:34:10,550
Don't cross this line again.

613
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:13,489
Don't touch the pots and pans again.

614
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:15,380
I won't touch them. I promise I won't touch them.

615
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:16,770
I'll listen to you.

616
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:28,900
Mother.

617
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:34,870
Young Master.

621
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,300
Yunqi, are you okay?

622
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:47,340
Young Master.

623
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:48,310
Yunqi.

624
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,280
Yunqi, wake up.

625
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:52,469
Young Master.

626
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:06,280
Why are you back?

627
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:07,750
I felt uneasy when I wasn't here.

628
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,570
Young Master, let me get you some water.

629
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,850
Where is it hidden?

630
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:57,520
Open your mouth.

631
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:25,960
Auntie Hei.

632
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:29,270
Where do you think my brother hid it?

633
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:30,870
Maybe

634
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,880
he really gave it to experts.

635
00:36:33,390 --> 00:36:34,560
That's impossible. Look for it.

636
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:54,930
Who is it?

637
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,080
Jiutian.

638
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,200
You recognized me

639
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,380
by my butt?

640
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:09,590
What are you doing at Brother's room

641
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,410
at this time?

642
00:37:12,950 --> 00:37:14,630
What are you doing here?

643
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:15,850
I...

644

I... I'm doing what you're doing.

645
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:20,430
We have the same goal.

646
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,490
Our goals are different.

647
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:23,870
The thing I'm looking for

648
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,960
is different

649
00:37:25,470 --> 00:37:26,480
from what you're looking for.

650
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,660
What do you mean?

651
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,470
OK.

652
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,640
Go ahead. I'm done.

653
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,490
I'll go to the police station

654
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:35,590
and have some tea with Brother.

655
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,610
Brother,

656
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,800
if my brother knew about this,

657
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,110
he wouldn't do anything to me.

658
00:37:43,950 --> 00:37:45,370
But if he knew

659
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,720
your matter,

660
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,520
you would be in big trouble.

661
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:49,780
What matter is it?

662
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:59,020
The ancient tomb of the Qing Dynasty.

663
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:06,670
What? What did you say?

664
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,140
I don't understand.

665
00:38:10,870 --> 00:38:11,710
It's out. Here.

666
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:12,550
Take it.

667
00:38:13,510 --> 00:38:14,140
I won't drink tea.

668
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,070
I couldn't sleep if I drank too much.

669
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,540
I need to find something to eat.

670
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:17,840
Go on with your work.

671
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,750
My hand is swollen.

672
00:38:27,630 --> 00:38:29,350
My lady, should we continue looking for it?

673
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:32,080
Brother has searched everywhere.

674
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:34,350
It's not here.

675
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,030
Give my comb back to me.

676
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,810
What comb is it?

677
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:52,950
It's hanging on your neck.

678
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,170
I saw it.

679
00:38:55,130 --> 00:38:55,850
Give it back to me.

680
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:56,940
It's mine.

681
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:58,160
It's yours?

682
00:38:58,490 --> 00:38:59,630
Where did you get it?

683
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:01,640
I won't tell you.

684
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,790
Give it back to me.

Sect Leader Zhou.

687
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,620
Your disciples have been questioned.

688
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,430
They have nothing to do with the case of the tomb of the Qing Dynasty.

689

I sent them back for you today.

00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,960
You arrested them and released them

691
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,940
for no reason.

692
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,370
Isn't there any explanation?

693
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,290
We only arrest people.

694
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,140
We release some of them occasionally.

695
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,960
But it's our first time

696
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:42,110
sending people back.

697
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,990
If you want any explanations,

698
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:47,550
you can only talk to our director.

699
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:50,570
Okay.

700
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,510
We have plenty of time.

701
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,570
Tell your director

702
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,350
that he's on my mind.

703
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:07,880
OK.

704
00:40:08,250 --> 00:40:10,020
I will tell him.

705
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:13,290
Thank you. See you.

706
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,630
Master.

707
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:26,020
I didn't embarrass you.

708
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,360
Xiao Liuzi couldn't stand it.

709
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:28,960
He cried.

710
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,680
Does it still hurt?

711
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:49,250
Master.

712
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,230
I embarrassed you.

713
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,850
I failed to protect you.

714
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,780
Fine.

715
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:01,550
I've

716
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:02,520
tried

717
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,820
all the methods.

718
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:04,830
They're useless.

719
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:06,260
I still can't find my father.

720
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:08,560
I don't have a clue now.

721
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,870
The dragon bone is still in Luo Yunsong's hands.

722
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:12,720
It's really hard.

723
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:18,900
Who was the masked man

724
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,240
that saved you at the dock that day?

725
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:22,380
I don't know.

726
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,470
Then why did Chu Fengling save you?

727
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:43,630
[Feng]

728
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,320
Chu Fengling?

729
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,260
Since she saved you,

730
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:51,280
why didn't she return the dragon bone?
