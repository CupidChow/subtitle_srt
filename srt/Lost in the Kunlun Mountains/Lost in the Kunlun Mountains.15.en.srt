[Episode 15]

4
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,300
Our Mound-digging Sect

5
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:42,990
guards the word loneliness.

6
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:46,810
Most of our disciples are orphans.

7
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,620
Apart from that,

8
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,130
the others are separated from their family

9
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:52,890
and helpless.

10
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,410
I...

11
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:57,090
was the same.

12
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:01,500
My master saved me

13
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,390
when I wandered in a strange city.

14
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,780
He took me with him,

15
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:07,670
and taught me kungfu and how to be a man.

16
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,229
At that time,

17
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,370
there were thousands of disciples.

18
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:16,440
Master treated everyone the same way.

19
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,320
He took us all the way

20
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,720
and fought with us all the way.

21
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,200
On the way here,

22
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,870
many of my friends

23
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,980
of the past

24
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,000
were gone.

25
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,680
After that,

26
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,050
I became the sect leader.

27
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,720
Gradually, I had you.

28
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,960
I taught you

29
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,740
the way my master taught me,

30
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,900
even

31
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:48,250
stricter than him.

32
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,600
Why?

33
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,920
Because we are living

34
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,730
a risky life.

35
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,410
I want you to learn kungfu well

36
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,829
and protect yourselves

37
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,130
and your brothers and sisters around.

38
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:03,450
I don't want you to lose your family when you were little

39
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,510
and to lose your brothers and sisters after you grow up.

40
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,360
I know.

41
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,920
Many of you complain about

42
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,090
and even hate me.

43
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:18,780
But it doesn't matter.

44
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:19,960
I don't care.

45
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,040
I just hope that after I die,

46
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,050
you can still live.

47
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,160
You can still help each other

48
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:31,910
and support each other.

49
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,829
After working hard for half of my life,

50
00:03:34,829 --> 00:03:36,030
I finally understand

51
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:38,740
what is the most important thing in the world.

52
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:41,630
That is to live,

53
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:46,420
to live well with families.

54
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:52,590
Now,

55
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,730
I want you to take a look at everyone around you clearly

56
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,270
and remember them.

57
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:01,160
Remember them firmly.

58
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,910
Because they are the families

59
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,990
that you have to risk your life

60
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,420
to protect.

61
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,370
Put it in my study.

62
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,840
Don't let Fengling see it.

63
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,040
She will be sad again.

64
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,890
Yes, sir.

65
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,830
Any news?

66
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,690
Jiutian

67
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,080
met an opium dealer

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,740
and dealt with this business.

69
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,100
Where is the man from?

70
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,570
I've asked.

71
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,560
None of the sects admitted that there was such a person.

72
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,760
I guess it was a trap from the beginning.

73
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,680
Who did

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,200
Jiutian took to the dock?

75
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,540
I heard he borrowed someone

76
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,400
from Cui Yanzhi of Xuanwei Zitan.

77
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,250
Cui Yanzhi?

78
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,230
Why did Cui Yanzhi suddenly

79
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,450
turn her back against us

80
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,950
and deal with Jiutian together with Fatty Hu?

81
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:42,120
Let the Mound-digging check

82
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,550
the relationship between

83
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,980
this Cui Yanzhi and Fatty Hu.

84
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,740
Yes.

85
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,550
Brother.

86
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,890
The car is ready.

87
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,400
When are you leaving?

88
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,190
What?

89
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:19,340
Isn't Wu Shuang going with you?

90
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,060
Not really.

91
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,090
It's just that...

92
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,750
I can't explain it.

93
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,990
It seems that you are really into her.

94
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,170
Did you tell her?

95
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,950
She's stubborn.

96
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,830
She insisted that

97
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,220
giving her the dragon bone back then

98
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,420
equaled to giving her the bride-price.

99
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:52,430
Then it's your fault.

100
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:54,240
You gave her the dragon bone.

101
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,570
It was indeed giving her the bride-price.

102
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:58,230
How would I know the rules?

103
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,490
We all know that.

104
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:02,510
What?

105
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:04,930
You want to deny the marriage?

106
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,500
I won't be on your side this time.

107
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:11,040
The disciples of the Penta-sect abide by the rules of lacking one thing.

108
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,300
They lead tough lives.

109
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,080
Only the female disciples of Mound-digging

110
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,710
can have some hope.

111
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,990
That is to marry the Heaven Official.

112
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:24,520
You and Wu Shuang love each other.

113
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,790
And you gave her the bride-price in public.

114
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,710
Not to mention it's Wu Shuang.

115
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:32,670
No one would think it's fine.

116
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,140
If it were me...

117
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,650
Fine.

118
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,880
Even if you don't know it,

119
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:00,300
don't you think

120
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,230
this is fate?

121
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,830
Sister,

122
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,550
I've told you many times

123
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,520
I don't want to be the Heaven Official.

124
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,650
All I want to do now is to find my father.

125
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,460
After you find your father,

126
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,080
will you marry her?

127
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,400
But my question is useless.

128
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,320
A female disciple of Mound-digging

129
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,320
can only marry the Heaven Official.

130
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,310
If you don't become the Heaven Official,

131
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:29,440
you can't marry her even if you want to.

132
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,179
Now I understand.

133
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:39,150
What?

134
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:41,460
You won't leave Shanghai

135
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,890
in a short time.

136
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,760
I hope Commander Hu

137
00:08:48,310 --> 00:08:50,830
doesn't have time to take care of you for the time being.

138
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,670
Sister,

139
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,410
did you also go to the Commander's Mansion that day?

140
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:57,330
What do you think?

141
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:04,050
I don't want you to risk your lives for me again.

142
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,070
Then leave Shanghai.

143
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,430
Of course.

144
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,150
It's up to you.

145
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,630
I promised your father

146
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,890
to keep you safe.

147
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,130
I won't break my promise.

148
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,060
If you want to stay,

149
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:22,560
I'll accompany you.

150
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,070
No need.

151
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,230
I don't want to trouble everybody.

152
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:29,630
Everyone of the martial artists community has its own fate.

153
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:31,060
Stop thinking about us.

154
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,030
If you have time,

155
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,880
think about

156
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,210
your own stuff clearly.

157
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:38,530
Alright.

158
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm leaving.

159
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,150
By the way,

160
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,360
I've arranged some men downstairs.

161
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,070
You just need to go to the rooftop and stroke your hair,

162
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:55,070
and my men will rush up in one minute.

163
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:56,810
Be careful.

164
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:58,080
I'm leaving.

165
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:27,850
Put the gun down.

166
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,070
Put the gun down!

167
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,360
Are you Director Luo Yunsong?

168
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:01,570
Yes, I am.

169
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:04,640
Put the gun down. Take him away.

170
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:05,890
I'll see who dares!

171
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:14,080
Brother.

172
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,190
Captain Zhou.

173
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,930
Hello, Ms. Chu.

174
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,540
Captain Zhou.

175
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,800
Why are you here?

176
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:36,760
What...

177
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:38,150
What happened?

178
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,710
Under Her Ladyship's order,

179
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,760
I will take Director Luo Yunsong

180
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,160
back for investigation.

181
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:45,710
Biao.

182
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:47,140
Put the gun down.

183
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,150
This is Her Ladyship's captain of guards,

184
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:58,390
Captain Zhou.

185
00:11:59,270 --> 00:11:59,950
Can you tell me

186
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:01,330
what happened?

187
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:03,140
Ms. Chu.

188
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,820
My mission is

189
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,420
to take Director Luo Yunsong back for investigation.

190
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,390
If he resists,

191
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:10,450
I can execute him on the spot.

192
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:12,420
I know nothing other than that.

193
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,700
Fengling.

194
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,100
It's fine.

195
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,540
I'll go back with Captain Zhou.

196
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:23,930
Biao.

197
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,800
Watch the house well.

198
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:27,620
Yes, Director.

199
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:29,550
Brother.

200
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,690
I'm fine.

201
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:48,790
No way.

202
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,920
Commander Hu is circumspect and farseeing.

203
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,460
He transferred a large batch of things from the ancient tomb

204
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:56,220
to Her Ladyship,

205
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,000
saying to submit them to the country.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:12:59,930
At the same time,

207
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:02,270
he revealed everything about

208
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,920
Luo Jiutian selling the opium

209
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,700
and Luo Yunsong attempting to

210
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,080
hide the Han Tomb and take everything in his own pocket.

211
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,010
Do you think

212
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,740
Luo Yunsong can get away?

213
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:16,990
What about Chu Fengling?

214
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,990
Commander Hu didn't know

215
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:26,510
what the relationship between Her Ladyship and Chu Fengling is.

216
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:28,640
That's why he didn't dare to touch her.

217
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,620
He said

218
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:33,750
Luo Yunsong did everything behind Chu Fengling's back.

219
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,660
No matter what,

220
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:37,470
Luo Yunsong

221
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,730
is completely ruined this time.

222
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,380
You have one less threat now.

223
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,410
Zhou Qiuhai should be happy

224
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:48,220
hearing about this.

225
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,690
I don't think Luo Yunsong

226
00:13:49,690 --> 00:13:50,860
is any threat to me.

227
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:54,430
Yes.

228
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:56,620
Mr. Zhou must be happy.

229
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:58,890
Anyway,

230
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,570
Luo Yunsong did make great efforts

231
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:02,750
on Penta-sect.

232
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:05,140
No one knows

233
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,770
what he's up to in his mind.

234
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,700
It has saved worries for us

235
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,520
to get rid of him.

236
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,410
Luo Yunsong

237
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:20,350
had a hard life.

238
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,140
Director.

239
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:56,090
Director.

240
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,500
I'm not a director anymore.

241
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,680
Yes.

242
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,460
Brother.

243
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:31,700
You're still up?

244
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:37,540
Secretary Xu just called.

245
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,680
Brother.

246
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,570
I'm fine.

247
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,010
I feel relaxed without the burden of being an official.

248
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,560
I can take this opportunity

249
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,620
to have a good rest.

250
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,810
I'll talk to Her Ladyship.

251
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:50,610
It's useless.

252
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:55,690
Useless.

253
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,130
It was Her Ladyship who talked with me for that.

254
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,840
Jiutian was caught

255
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,570
dealing with opium at the dock.

256
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,760
Her Ladyship didn't look into it,

257
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,900
saying Jiutian has got what he deserved.

258
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:13,490
Besides,

259
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,820
it's not necessary to get others involved.

260
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,210
Also,

261
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,990
the Han tomb of Small Kunlun.

262
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,530
Her Ladyship believed Commander Hu's words.

263
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:30,600
I know it's useless no matter how I explain it.

264
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,620
I've seen too many such things

265
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,760
of manipulation.

266
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,660
I should thank you.

267
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:53,010
Because of you,

268
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,080
I only got discharged from the position today.

269
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,210
Otherwise,

270
00:16:58,010 --> 00:16:59,570
I would be shot to death.

271
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,780
Brother.

272
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,760
How could this happen?

273
00:17:09,810 --> 00:17:11,410
How could this happen?

274
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:15,020
Everyone in the world

275
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,869
is after profits.

276
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,300
Didn't I tell you way back?

277
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,819
You didn't believe me.

278
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:24,180
In this world,

279
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,410
no matter it's human or stuff,

280
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:30,350
nothing cannot be solved

281
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,570
by profits.

282
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,030
Commander Hu...

283
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:40,060
Commander Hu can be trusted by Her Ladyship

284
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:42,190
because he handed in

285
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,160
the treasures

286
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,090
dug from the Small Kunlun, right?

287
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,730
Why else?

288
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,030
Brother,

289
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,010
don't be discouraged.

290
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,130
I'm still a special member.

291
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,380
We still have a chance.

292
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,130
Fengling.

293
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,750
Listen to me.

294
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,720
Tell Her Ladyship.

295
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:14,110
You will quit

296
00:18:14,110 --> 00:18:16,680
being a special member of the Secret Investigation Team

297
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,080
of the Kunlun Mountains.

298
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,240
It's boring.

299
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,820
You and I are both not suitable for being officials.

300
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:26,290
We have no foundation.

301
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,090
All these years,

302
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,350
I worked so hard

303
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,290
and made great contributions.

304
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,020
I risked my life

305
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,400
and my brothers' lives

306
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,420
and got the position of police director.

307
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,300
But in the end?

308
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,500
Everything is gone

309
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,920
with just some words.

310
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:57,640
How should I deal with my brothers' lives?

311
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,090
How should I deal with the efforts I made and risks I took?

312
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,320
How should I deal with my time of all these years of fighting and killing?

313
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,670
This family.

314
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:15,520
I've been contributed so much

315
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,780
to supporting it. How should I deal with it if it collapses？

316
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,700
Revenge.

317
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,860
And how should I deal with the revenge I want to take?

318
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,120
Our parents' revenge.

319
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,600
And my second sister's revenge.

320
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:32,990
Jiutian's revenge.

321
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:36,010
How should I take them?

322
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,380
And you.

323
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:42,900
How should I protect you?

324
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,140
Brother.

325
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,460
Second brother is gone.

326
00:19:57,470 --> 00:19:59,270
But this family won't collapse.

327
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,550
I'm still here.

328
00:20:02,510 --> 00:20:04,070
I'll support this family.

329
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,890
Where is Wu Shuang?

330
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:06,870
She's not here.

331
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:09,080
Why do you want to see her, Ms. Chu?

332
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,780
Did you have a fight?

333
00:21:13,950 --> 00:21:15,750
I don't want to talk about these.

334
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:22,650
After my brother died,

335
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,750
I thought everyone would

336
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,060
let many things go.

337
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:32,130
I didn't expect that people are still unhappy.

338
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,830
Happy?

339
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,770
Your idea is too extravagant.

340
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,490
Since I was eight,

341
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:41,390
I don't know what happiness is.

342
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,620
What about you?

343
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:47,220
My second brother is gone.

344
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,800
My big brother was dismissed.

345
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,750
Do you think I'm happy?

346
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:58,310
Your brother can't hold on any longer, right?

347
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,620
How did you know?

348
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,570
I've never seen you so depressed.

349
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,750
Only when your brother breaks down,

350
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,950
will you be like this.

351
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:13,740
It's not easy for him.

352
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,030
I can imagine his look.

353
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,150
Since little,

354
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:23,610
I've never seen my brother be so dispirited.

355
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:26,270
Yunqi.

356
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,640
I'm so worried about him.

357
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,020
But I don't know

358
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,490
how to cheer him up.

359
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:36,310
If he doesn't want to,

360
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:38,430
it's useless for you to worry.

361
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:41,180
My brother is like this.

362
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:44,130
I have to support this family

363
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,140
and share his burden.

364
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,320
Yunqi.

365
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,610
You went to see Her Ladyship

366
00:22:55,930 --> 00:22:57,860
and negotiated with Commander Hu.

367
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,130
I will always remember the kindness.

368
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,620
However, I don't know

369
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,010
when I can pay you back.

370
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,820
Don't say that.

371
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,290
You once saved me.

372
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,430
We're even now.

373
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:17,300
Then, we're friends now.

374
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,480
Just call me Fengling.

375
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,480
Ms. Chu sounds too polite.

376
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:25,950
OK.

377
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:31,320
I kept my promise and returned the dragon bone to you.

378
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,880
Yunqi.

379
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,530
I hope you can consider

380
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:37,460
about our cooperation seriously.

381
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,730
Was the Small Kunlun opened in the end?

382
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,550
After we left,

383
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:45,880
Commander Hu opened it with the cannon.

384
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,720
It's not the Kunlun Mountains.

385
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,200
It's a feudal's tomb at the end of Han.

386
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,640
Through Small Kunlun,

387
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,400
everyone knows that

388
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,200
he covets the Kunlun Mountains.

389
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,440
I heard from Her Ladyship's secretary that

390
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,030
Her Ladyship scolded him severely

391
00:24:02,030 --> 00:24:04,090
and wanted to transfer him to Fujian.

392
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,580
She hoped he can restrain himself this time

393
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,760
and don't be so arrogant

394
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,360
and do bad things anymore.

395
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:16,980
He intended to target me and my father

396
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,910
after he got the dragon bone.

397
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,410
This Fatty Hu

398
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,340
is too cruel.

399
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:28,620
Yunqi.

400
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,040
Do you know?

401
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,660
The most humiliating time in my life

402
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:37,430
was the moment waiting to be shot

403
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,490
in that yard.

404
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:43,100
It's like a lamb to be slaughtered.

405
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:46,520
I think my brother must've felt

406
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:48,460
the same way before he died.

407
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,240
Everything

408
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:03,390
is human nature and greed.

409
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,960
How many people have been killed

410
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,840
because of the invisible Kunlun Mountains?

411
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:18,810
Yunqi.

412
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:20,480
I've made up my mind.

413
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,430
I want to continue looking for the Kunlun Mountains.

414
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,520
For the country,

415
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,990
for my family,

416
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,210
for my brother,

417
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:30,350
and my passed second brother.

418
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,750
I must find it.

419
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,390
It should belong to the country.

420
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,460
I cannot let more people die due to it.

421
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,780
Yunqi.

422
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,960
Will you help me?

423
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,620
I just want to find my father now.

424
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,300
Just want to find your father?

425
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,000
Yes.

426
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:56,650
What about Wu Shuang?

427
00:25:57,650 --> 00:26:00,580
Haven't you thought about the thing between you two?

428
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,420
She told me in prison that

429
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:07,050
she worked so hard to find the dragon bone

430
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,200
because she wanted to marry you.

431
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,350
If you don't love her,

432
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:13,070
just tell her.

433
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:14,540
Don't hurt her.

434
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:19,960
I'll go back first.

435
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:23,190
Think about the cooperation again.

436
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,040
I'll wait for your response.

437
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,390
What took you so long?

438
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,900
I'm scared.

439
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:56,690
What are you afraid of?

440
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,140
Xingchen.

441
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:00,990
Let's run away.

442
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:03,830
Running away is betraying our sect.

443
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:04,810
Besides,

444
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:06,410
where can we escape?

445
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,190
As long as people of the Penta-sect find us,

446
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:11,520
we will definitely die.

447
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:15,650
Wu Shuang.

448
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,670
Wu Shuang.

449
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:27,320
Wu Shuang.

450
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:31,650
Wu Shuang.

451
00:27:34,710 --> 00:27:37,170
You said you wouldn't hide anything from me.

452
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,970
How dare I tell you?

453
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,900
If Master finds out, we'll die.

454
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,930
Don't be angry, okay?

455
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,360
What do you want to know?

456
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,750
I'll tell you now.

457
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:50,970
Wu Shuang.

458
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,000
Don't be angry.

459
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,430
Senior Hua really likes me.

460
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:04,240
You are so careless.

461
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:08,480
We always meet in secret.

462
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,120
When will this end?

463
00:28:11,170 --> 00:28:12,170
I envy you so much.

464
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,280
You and Ding Yunqi

465
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,630
can be together openly.

466
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,140
We're not together.

467
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:20,530
You still deny it?

468
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,590
You lived in the bell tower for so many days.

469
00:28:22,590 --> 00:28:24,250
Do you know how envious we are?

470
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,460
I'm really not with Ding Yunqi.

471
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,270
There's nothing between us.

472
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:30,870
I can't explain it to you. Believe it or not.

473
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:32,600
Fine, I believe you.

474
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,460
Besides,

475
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:38,640
nothing will happen

476
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,040
between us in the future.

477
00:28:40,690 --> 00:28:41,870
I won't leave

478
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:44,950
Mound-digging any more after I go back.

479
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,900
Newspaper!

480
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:26,680
Director of police connived at his brother selling opium

481
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,450
and was dismissed.

482
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,760
Give me one.

483
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:31,600
Okay.

484
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,490
Mr. Ding, My Lord said he's not seeing anyone.

485
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,500
Please leave.

486
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:52,640
Go back.

487
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,110
OK.

488
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:58,220
Yunqi, why are you here?

489
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,000
I'm here to visit your brother.

490
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,960
He is sitting alone in the garden every day,

491
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:08,310
talking to no one and eating nothing.

492
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,870
I'm really worried that if this continues...

493
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:12,930
He will get better.

494
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,270
You can leave.

495
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,100
Mr. Luo,

496
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:08,950
Are you so eager to laugh at me?

497
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,430
I just came to see you.

498
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,330
What?

499
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,950
Do you think you're a joke?

500
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,930
I don't think

501
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:24,400
a man must have a label to live a decent life.

502
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,760
You returned the dragon bone to me.

503
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:29,360
The thing between us has ended.

504
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:34,320
Impossible.

505
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,340
All I have left is

506
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:39,940
revenge.

507
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,500
It's okay to take revenge.

508
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,760
But you have to cheer up first.

509
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,000
Otherwise,

510
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,820
even if your enemy is in front of you,

511
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,350
they will only laugh at you.

512
00:32:04,010 --> 00:32:05,140
Besides revenge,

513
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,460
you have lots of things to do.

514
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,810
Are you teaching me how to do things?

515
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,910
I think I saved your life.

516
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,640
So I can talk to you.

517
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,110
Because you saved my life,

518
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,240
you think you can

519
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,050
talk to me in a leading position?

520
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:32,900
Did I?

521
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:35,260
No.

522
00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:39,330
It's because you think you are inferior yourself.

523
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,340
I know

524
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,850
you want to avenge Commander Hu.

525
00:32:45,670 --> 00:32:47,060
But you can't do anything to him

526
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,190
if you are like this.

527
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:53,480
Sometimes, it's good that people don't have power.

528
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,080
It can make you

529
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:56,410
calm down and think more

530
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:58,570
before you do anything.

531
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:11,040
Revenging for a dead one

532
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,430
and taking good care of someone around you.

533
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:14,430
Which do you think

534
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:16,670
is more important?

535
00:34:06,140 --> 00:34:07,740
What are you going to do next?

536
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,570
Brother.

537
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,420
Tell me.

538
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,469
If my father is not in Shanghai,

539
00:34:16,469 --> 00:34:18,670
where would my father be most possibly?

540
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,510
It's hard to say.

541
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:25,080
Master Ding is always unpredictable.

542
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,480
Every time I just receive his order

543
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,540
and meet him at his designated place.

544
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:31,679
What?

545
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,409
You think he's not in Shanghai?

546
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:36,590
If he is in Shanghai,

547
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,480
he would show up

548
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,909
since such a big thing happened.

549
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,480
Aren't the killing and fighting normal

550
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:48,810
in the martial artists community?

551
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,159
Why?

552
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,850
Yunqi.

553
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,949
I can't answer that.

554
00:34:56,830 --> 00:34:57,800
But

555
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,760
we've been through this for so many years.

556
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,170
Killing people

557
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,320
for own selfish desires.

558
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,790
Endless revenge

559
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:08,760
and fights.

560
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:10,990
Don't you hate it?

561
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,850
My father must have left

562
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:23,110
because he hates such a martial artist community.

563
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:24,830
You want to leave too?

564
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:28,670
I don't know.

565
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,280
But

566
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,570
the dragon bone is still in Wu Shuang's hands.

567
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,240
Just leave it with her.

568
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,170
When I figure it out,

569
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,100
I will go get it.

570
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:09,530
Master, why don't we bring more men?

571
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:10,210
What if...

572
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:11,210
There's no if.

573
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,670
Sect Leader Zhou,

574
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,800
you are a little impatient.

575
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:46,760
On the way here,

576
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,190
I was thinking...

577
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,970
But when I saw you just now,

578
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,100
and when I sit here,

579
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,280
I was thinking

580
00:37:55,250 --> 00:37:57,010
how should I address you?

581
00:38:02,890 --> 00:38:05,540
Should I call you Director Luo

582
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,550
or Mr. Luo?

583
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,090
If I call you Director Luo,

584
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:19,350
it would seem that I'm not well-informed

585
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,790
and I want to humiliate you.

586
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:25,060
If I call you Mr. Luo,

587
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:29,770
it would be too snobbish,

588
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,200
and it would have the implication of hitting someone when he's down.

589
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,600
It's too hard.

590
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,440
It's too hard.

591
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,990
You really revenge for every grievance.

592
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:51,610
Thank you

593
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:54,000
for your mercy that day, Director Luo.

594
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,140
So that I wouldn't have any more loss of lives

595
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,500
in my Mound-digging Sect.

596
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,920
Today,

597
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,150
since Mr. Luo is free,

598
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,830
I came here

599
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:05,510
to return the favor.

600
00:39:08,870 --> 00:39:11,470
Are you visiting in return, or coming for fun?

601
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:14,200
No.

602
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:17,690
I don't see any fun here.

603
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,230
Then for settling things.

604
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,020
There's nothing wrong with that.

605
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,480
But you are too confident.

606
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,210
You shouldn't come with only two people.

607
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,880
Because you will suffer loss.

608
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:45,580
I never care to do

609
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,750
such things like bullying others with more men.

610
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,600
What about Mr. Luo?

611
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,570
Inside and outside.

612
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:57,080
Obvious and hidden.

613
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:00,110
You have a dozen men.

614
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,860
I just came with one of my disciples.

615
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:04,730
It's not bullying

616
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,050
with only us two here, right?

617
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,250
Speaking of settling things,

618
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,450
I've counted everything.

619
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,080
I came today to settle everything with you.

620
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,070
In the dock some days ago,

621
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,340
Mr. Luo's brother,

622
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:35,930
Luo Jiutian

623
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,540
shot two of my disciples of Mound-digging.

624
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,250
First, you framed our reputation of the Penta-sect

625
00:40:44,210 --> 00:40:46,810
and then took our disciples' lives.

626
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:49,080
Do you

627
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:50,720
admit it?

628
00:40:53,110 --> 00:40:54,200
Yes.

629
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,260
But

630
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:58,570
why did you come to settle these

631
00:40:58,570 --> 00:40:59,830
after I'm down?

632
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:02,430
It's not

633
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,890
that open and upright, right?

634
00:41:07,810 --> 00:41:09,740
There's a priority to everything.

635
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,980
We have to settle things anyway.

636
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,240
Since you admitted it.

637
00:41:20,490 --> 00:41:22,640
Humiliating the reputation of our Penta-sect

638
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
equals to your dismissal.

639
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,170
This is a good deed, right?

640
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:28,980
Yes.

641
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:35,240
You hurt my disciples.

642
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,020
I only take your brother Luo Jiutian's life

643
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,530
to pay for their lives.

644
00:41:41,870 --> 00:41:43,000
This can be regarded

645
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,320
kind, right?

646
00:41:57,790 --> 00:41:59,590
Since the beginning,

647
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,320
Jiutian selling opium

648
00:42:02,030 --> 00:42:03,460
was a trap set by you.

649
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,700
Flattered.

650
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,930
From the beginning to the end,

651
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,750
it was done

652
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,480
by this disciple of mine alone.

653
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,900
It's not a big deal.

654
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,040
I don't need to make a fuss.

655
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:46,300
I intended to

656
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,280
make it bigger.

657
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,820
But considering that I haven't figured out

658
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:56,000
some interesting points

659
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:57,980
of Mr. Luo.

660
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,620
So let's

661
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,970
settle this later slowly.

662
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:05,660
Anytime.

663
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:16,950
By the way,

664
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:19,480
your team welcomed me greatly when I came.

665
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:20,530
When I leave,

666
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,710
don't make a fuss.

667
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,690
If you want to find me,

668
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:28,420
just come to the headquarters of Mound-digging.

669
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:30,020
I'll make you some tea.

670
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:45,850
Cigarettes.

671
00:43:45,910 --> 00:43:47,530
Cigarettes.

672
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,720
Come and buy cigarettes.

673
00:43:50,010 --> 00:43:51,410
What's wrong with him today?

674
00:43:51,410 --> 00:43:51,900
Cigarettes.

675
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:54,060
Did he eat the strength pill? Why is he so loud?
