They are officials,

109

but they really wouldn't

110
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,990
follow bureaucratic rules.

111
00:08:51,830 --> 00:08:53,220

Once I dig up the Small Kunlun,

143

he will return the dragon bone.

144

Who else could it be?

155

Jiutian was also set up

156
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,670
by Commander Hu in the opium incident?

157
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,680
Of course.

158
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:46,110
Biao.

159

I think this matter can be changed.

160
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:49,850
What do you mean?

161
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,650
Commander Hu caught Jiutian

162
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:53,420
to limit me.

163
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:56,530
If he really wanted to kill him,

164
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:58,840
why did he do that?

165
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:01,730
He just wants money.

166
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,050
That would be great.

167
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:07,320
We won't fight with him.

168

What about tomorrow's plan?

171
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,790
Without the 20 men of Master Tuo,

If we act rashly,

176
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:32,180
we won't be able to win.

177
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,530
Black Feather Team will stay in tomorrow.

178
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:41,170
The other arrangements are the same.

179
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,680
In this case,

180
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,280
if something happens,

181
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,380
we still have a chance to make a comeback.

182
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:50,450
Biao.

183
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,610
It depends on your destiny tomorrow.

184
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,630
Got it.

185
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:24,130
Senior Jiang, why are you here?

186
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,750
Master sent me here today.

187
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,090
I have a message for you.

188
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,810
What is it?

189
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,460
Master said you can't go

190
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:34,840
to the Small Kunlun.

191
00:12:35,850 --> 00:12:36,990
Why?

192
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,190
Yunqi.

193
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,950
Did you go to see my master?

194
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,590
No.

195
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,860
Look, it's two to two now.

196
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,750
You are right.

197
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:50,800
But for safety,

198
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:52,320
you'd better not go.

199
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,580
But if I don't go,

200
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,350
how could I help Fengling dig up the tomb?

201
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,190
Didn't you tell her

202
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,280
the exact location?

203
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,460
But they...

204
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,210
They are not tomb raiders.

205
00:13:00,210 --> 00:13:01,140
It's the government's behavior.

206
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,610
They would open up the tomb openly.

207
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,920
Besides, it's not necessary for you

208
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,880
to give them suggestions.

209
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,940
You have no practical experience.

210
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:09,620
If you don't listen to me,

211
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:10,540
you should listen to your master.

212
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:16,300
You are all here.

213
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:18,020
What's wrong with you guys?

214
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:19,700
Fengling.

215
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,870
Wu Shuang, Yunqi.

216
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,470
Hello.

217
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:23,230
Hello.

218
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:26,800
Yunqi, are you coming with us?

219
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:28,770
He's not going.

220
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:29,950
I'll go with you.

221
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:31,630
Let's go. If you don't leave now,

222
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,760
we'll miss the auspicious time.

223
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,360
Wu Shuang.

224
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,520
Take care of each other.

225
00:13:39,730 --> 00:13:40,610
Don't try to be brave

226
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:42,000
when something happens.

227
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,550
Don't worry. I won't.

228
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,490
-Let's go. -Let's go

229
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,800
Wu Shuang.

230
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,930
Why don't you stop her?

231
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,400
It concerns the dragon bone.

232
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,620
How can I stop her?

233
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,700
Do you think something will happen?

234
00:14:08,170 --> 00:14:09,800
Don't worry. If anything happens,

235
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,150
we'll be there.

236
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,430
Okay, I'll report to Master.

237
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:17,830
Yunqi, if you need any help

238
00:14:17,830 --> 00:14:18,920
in the future,

239
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,010
I will help.

240
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:21,270
Thank you.

241
00:14:22,070 --> 00:14:22,820
I'm leaving.

242
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,490
Commander Hu can't wait.

243
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:41,180
You are so smart.

244
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,780
Of course everyone wants to know you.

245
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,650
He just arrested Luo Yunsong's brother.

246
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:54,780
Today,

247
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,390
he went to open up a tomb with Luo Yunsong in the Small Kunlun.

248
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Logically speaking,

249
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:00,790
he has no time for me.

250
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:07,720
Unless

251
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,120
he's determined to go after the Kunlun Mountains.

252
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,120
Does he really think

253
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,510
that the Kunlun Mountains are

254
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,350
in Small Kunlun?

255
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,210
He really thinks so.

256
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,550
Besides,

257
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:25,820
no matter what's in Small Kunlun

258
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,880
he has decided to go after

259
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,520
the Kunlun Mountains.

260
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,350
Brother,

261
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:36,530
listen to me.

262
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,340
There's nothing you want in Shanghai.

263
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:42,540
This place is all about danger.

264
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:44,590
If you want,

265
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,950
you can take that girl with you.

266
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:51,060
I've prepared a car and money

267
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,320
for you.

268
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:54,340
Master Jiu and Cui Yi

269
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:55,980
will send you out of Shanghai.

270
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:06,810
How do you know there's nothing I want in Shanghai?

271
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,750
Your father

272
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,150
is not in Shanghai.

273
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:27,900
Guys,

274
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,490
work harder.

275
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,920
You'll be rewarded.

276
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:33,980
How many treasures

277
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:35,710
can be found today, bro?

278
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,550
No matter how many we find,

279
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,780
it's Commander Hu's blessing.

280
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,430
Don’t say that.

281
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,950
We are brothers.

282
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:48,390
Bro, mine is yours.

283
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,520
We are equal.

284
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,290
Since Commander Hu said so,

285
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:53,050
I'd like to

286
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,520
ask you for a favor.

287
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,170
What do you mean?

288
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:59,140
What do you want? Tell me.

289
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,579
Commander,

290
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,150
my brother is quite naughty.

291
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,130
He was caught by your men

292
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,310
because of something.

293
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,510
Really?

294
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:23,540
Adjutant Jin.

295
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,220
Yes.

296
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:26,400
Who dares to

297
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,750
arrest my bro's brother?

298
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,520
Commander,

299
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:31,730
with you here,

300
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,010
no one dares to harass Director Luo's family.

301
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,620
No?

302
00:17:41,430 --> 00:17:42,650
Did you catch him or not?

303
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:43,870
Commander,

304
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,840
we caught a few people yesterday,

305
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,650
but they are all opium traffickers.

306
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,920
We'll kill them at your command.

307
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,140
Opium traffickers.

308
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,480
No one dares to touch your brother.

309
00:17:58,230 --> 00:18:00,170
Your brother is my brother.

310
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,300
My brother.

311
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,070
Who dares to arrest him?

312
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:05,790
That's right.

313
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:08,900
But bro,

314
00:18:09,870 --> 00:18:11,210
will someone

315
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,140
gossip

316
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,250
between us?

317
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,020
Here's the thing.

318
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,490
My brother got the news yesterday

319
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:22,170
that someone traded opium at the dock.

320
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,780
So he took a team to set up defense.

321
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,420
And then

322
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,510
Commander's men went

323
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,270
and caught them all.

324
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,040
I was thinking

325
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,270
if there is any misunderstanding.

326
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,660
Now,

327
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,750
immediately

328
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:38,720
inform our men,

329
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:39,980
don't kill those

330
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,240
opium traffickers.

331
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,510
I'll go back and see if there's my brother.

332
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,100
Hurry up.

333
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,860
Yes.

334
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:50,020
Thank you, Commander. Thank you for your understanding.

335
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,660
Don’t mention it.

336
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:53,710
Here, bro.

337
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:54,510
Come.

338
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,790
Commander, we found the tomb gate.

339
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,420
Brother,

340
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,120
the door is about to open.

341
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:11,480
Shouldn't we hold a ceremony?

342
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:14,040
I don't know about this.

343
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,050
Is there a ceremony?

344
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,140
Of course.

345
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,070
Ordinary people will put firecrackers

346
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,210
when they install beams for their house.

347
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,800
It's such a big fortune.

348
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,440
Shouldn't we have something happy?

349
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,710
Commander.

350
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,680
It's in the middle of nowhere.

351
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,240
We have nowhere to buy firecrackers.

352
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,820
I'm here. Don't worry about anything.

353
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,050
Look at me.

354
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:15,530
How is it?

355
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,260
As long as my cannons are fired,

356
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:19,810
no evil,

357
00:20:19,810 --> 00:20:20,950
mountain demon or tree monster

358
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,470
dares to come forward.

359
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:26,150
Have some fun.

360
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,190
If you want to play,

361
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,870
just wave your hand over there.

362
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,270
Commander is powerful.

363
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,860
Who dares to offend you?

364
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,510
Commander.

365
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,100
We found the gate.

366
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,950
Shall we open the gate or not?

367
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,210
The gate

368
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:50,930
should be opened.

369
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,160
But this isn't the gate I would open.

370
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,470
Get him!

371
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,120
-Freeze! -Don't move.

372
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,930
-Don't move. -Don’t move. Don’t move.

373
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:17,100
Director.

374
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,710
Please come in.

375
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:21,550
Go.

376
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:26,880
Go!

377
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,760
How do you know my father is not in Shanghai?

378
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:45,780
Who are you?

379
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,600
We are born with Yin and Yang.

380
00:21:50,150 --> 00:21:52,380
The rule of heaven and earth, the way of everything.

381
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,000
You are a mountain mover.

382
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,190
I'm Zi Gu, a member of Mountain-moving Sect.

383
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,950
Greetings. Young Heaven Official.

384
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,650
So you know where my father is?

385
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,330
Six months ago,

386
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,220
Master Ding sent a letter,

387
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,270
informing that if you come to Shanghai,

388
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,000
we must assist you secretly.

389
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:20,940
So,

390
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,700
when you stepped into Shanghai,

391
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,880
all your whereabouts are

392
00:22:25,390 --> 00:22:27,030
under our control.

393
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:28,870
Because

394
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,680
we were afraid our identity would be exposed,

395
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,230
so

396
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:35,170
we could only help you

397
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,990
secretly in recent troubles.

398
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,210
Thank you.

399
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:56,890
Did my father say anything else?

400
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,880
Master Ding is always unpredictable.

401
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,260
As for the rest,

402
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,350
he said nothing.

403
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:05,660
Shanghai is complicated.

404
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,180
And Zhou Qiuhai

405
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,810
is openly against Master Ding.

406
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,790
No one knows

407
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,710
what he's up to.

408
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:13,560
Many years ago,

409
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,410
Shou WuJiang, Leader of Gold Touching Sect, disappeared.

410
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,840
More than ten years ago,

411
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,350
our sect leader, Lao Beifeng

412
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,150
was gone too.

413
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,830
Mountain-demounting Sect

414
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,050
has been decaying for many years.

415
00:23:24,230 --> 00:23:25,700
Now even Master Ding...

416
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:28,180
Apart from you,

417
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,980
only Master Ding and you Young Heaven Official

418
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,380
know our identity.

419
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:34,850
Sister.

420
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,490
Stop calling me Young Heaven Official.

421
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,210
It makes me uncomfortable.

422
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:40,150
Since we've known each other,

423
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,700
there should be rules.

424
00:23:41,990 --> 00:23:43,250
Please forgive

425
00:23:43,670 --> 00:23:45,190
my previous offense.

426
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,140
Although I'm a member of the Ding family,

427
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,950
I will never be a heaven official.

428
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,580
From now on,

429
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,720
let's call each other brother and sister in the future.

430
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,130
Okay.

431
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,100
I'll listen to you.

432
00:24:03,450 --> 00:24:04,250
Brother,

433
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:06,140
listen to me.

434
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,120
You can't stay in Shanghai anymore.

435
00:24:09,210 --> 00:24:12,270
Commander Hu is determined to take the Kunlun Mountains.

436
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,910
He won't let you go.

437
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,840
Leave Shanghai.

438
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,380
Commander Hu,

439
00:24:21,430 --> 00:24:22,940
what do you mean?

440
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,810
Your sister is quite good at playing dumb.

441
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,870
Not only his sister,

442
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:31,550
but also my sister.

443
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,210
The little Kunlun you told Her Ladyship

444
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,440
is this tomb?

445
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:39,740
If not this one,

446
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:40,830
then which one?

447
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,520
Are you kidding me?

448
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,250
Yes.

449
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,970
This is the tomb

450
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,150
you told Her Ladyship.

451
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,750
But this tomb is a fake tomb.

452
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,240
You want to keep the big one.

453
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:03,680
You can be greedy.

454
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,400
Who doesn't love money?

455
00:25:06,870 --> 00:25:08,130
But you can't be so evil

456
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,980
to set me up and make

457
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:11,950
me your cover.

458
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,830
What a detailed plan.

459
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,510
What are you talking about?

460
00:25:20,270 --> 00:25:21,530
There's no big tomb.

461
00:25:21,910 --> 00:25:23,170
This is the only one.

462
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,160
Don't think I don't know.

463
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:28,960
Come on.

464
00:25:31,270 --> 00:25:32,240
Bring him out.

465
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:35,350
Let's go.

466
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:36,730
Hurry up.

467
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,040
Let's go.

468
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:47,190
Brother,

469
00:25:47,570 --> 00:25:49,840
I'm sincere about...

470
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:51,600
the...

471
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,950
I'm sincere about...

472
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,630
That's what it goes like, right?

473
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,450
Commander, you are so literary.

474
00:25:59,710 --> 00:26:01,850
Why are you still making a fool of me?

475
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,960
You want to kill me

476
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:06,970
with a dozen men and guns.

477
00:26:07,810 --> 00:26:09,790
If you succeed in setting me up,

478
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,270
I would have wasted so many years.

479
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:19,450
Is there really another tomb?

480
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,360
Does my brother know?

481
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:32,130
It seems that you not only want the treasure,

482
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,370
but also want me to be your scapegoat.

483
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:41,750
You are good at nothing but shirking responsibilities.

484
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,360
What blame do you want me to take for you?

485
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,300
Commander Hu, this...

486
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:50,740
Is there any misunderstanding?

487
00:26:51,030 --> 00:26:51,910
Misunderstanding?

488
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,680
There is.

489
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,080
It's you think I'm stupid

490
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:58,840
and make trouble under my nose.

491
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:01,820
I'm telling you.

492
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,430
I'm cunning.

493
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:15,300
Master.

494
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,770
Since last night,

495
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:18,790
the entire Small Kunlun

496
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,550
is surrounded by the army's secret guards.

497
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,280
Our men at Qian Li Huo

498
00:27:22,280 --> 00:27:23,240
dare not enter.

499
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:24,800
This morning,

500
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,640
there were gunshots in the Little Kunlun.

501
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,110
But it doesn't look like a fight.

502
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,180
Master.

503
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,570
I'm sorry.

504
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:35,040
I failed to stop Wu Shuang this morning.

505
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,320
It's not your fault.

506
00:27:39,790 --> 00:27:41,180
Even Yunqi couldn't stop her.

507
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,530
She's determined to go to the Little Kunlun.

508
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,510
Any news about Luo Jiutian?

509
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:53,520
He has been imprisoned in the garrison prison.

510
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,540
No torture or interrogation.

511
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,890
How do you know everything?

512
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:12,170
In the garrison prison,

513
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,770
there's our informant.

514
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,430
There's a thief girl from the Penta-sect.

515
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,040
Who is a thief girl?

516
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,890
You don't like it?

517
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,450
I'll call you more while you're alive.

518
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,880
Thief girl!

519
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:34,890
Thief girl!

520
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:36,400
You fatty!

521
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:39,340
That sentence...

522
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:41,740
Big or small.

523
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:44,430
Win the small...

524
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,520
Call that...

525
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:46,480
that man here.

526
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,050
That one.

527
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,610
Come here.

528
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:52,950
Yes.

529
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:02,740
Commander.

530
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,080
Come, explain

531
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,720
what you just said.

532
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,860
Big or small. Win the small.

533
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,200
What is it called?

534
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,090
Small to the big.

535
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:13,950
That's it.

536
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:15,550
Thief girl!

537
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,440
The Kunlun Mountains that you're hiding

538
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,840
is under this tomb, right?

539
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,510
Guys,

540
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:27,980
don't worry.

541
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:30,120
Newspaper will report

542
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:31,880
in Shanghai.

543
00:29:33,350 --> 00:29:34,360
Director Luo

544
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:36,000
and his sister

545
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,690
and the thief girl from Penta-sect

546
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,280
stole

547
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,800
the ancient tomb of the Han Dynasty.

548
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,720
As for whether there's any force to resist...

549
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:54,560
and be annihilated by me,

550
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,420
that depends on my mood.

551
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,180
I'll save you a big photo.

552
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,360
So big.

553
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:06,870
A cross on it.

554
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,210
Director.

555
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,650
You're the one who started it.

556
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:26,990
You should show some mercy, right?

557
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:28,750
Commander,

558
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,310
this tomb raider is making a false accusation.

559
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:34,970
He said there's a tomb, so there's a tomb?

560
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:36,730
Yes.

561
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,380
According to him and what he has heard,

562
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,030
it's under this tomb.

563
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,720
It doesn't matter now.

564
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:48,320
I've sent the artillery here.

565
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,460
We'll know after a few bombs.

566
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,950
What if there isn't?

567
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:59,960
I wasn't sure at first.

568
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:03,480
But you ambushed the gunmen here.

569
00:31:04,490 --> 00:31:07,390
I believe there must be an ancient tomb here.

570
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,300
I told you

571
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,100
things you believe,

572
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,650
I will believe.

573
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,670
Things you don't believe,

574
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,730
I will still believe.

575
00:31:23,850 --> 00:31:24,690
Take them away.

576
00:31:28,810 --> 00:31:29,650
Take them away.

577
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,420
Sister.

578
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:45,570
Are you sure

579
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,460
my father is not in Shanghai?

580
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:49,770
He's not here.

581
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:51,150
Otherwise,

582
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,620
based on my understanding of Master Ding,

583
00:31:53,710 --> 00:31:55,020
with so many things have happened.

584
00:31:56,230 --> 00:31:57,540
he will show up.

585
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:10,180
Where will he go?

586
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:14,710
Also, brother.

587
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,960
You know

588
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:21,770
Xue Dingfeng

589
00:32:21,770 --> 00:32:23,030
who followed Luo Jiutian, right?

590
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,040
He's now working for Commander Hu.

591
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:27,190
I don't know where he got the news.

592
00:32:28,110 --> 00:32:29,370
He said there's really a big tomb

593
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:31,260
under the Small Kunlun.

594
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:33,360
For this tomb,

595
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:36,380
even if Commander Hu would kill Luo Yunsong's siblings,

596
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,430
I won't be surprised.

597
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,010
It's too late.

598
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:47,890
At this time,

599
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:50,030
Commander Hu has caught the people he wanted to arrest.

600
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,510
But don't worry.

601
00:32:52,850 --> 00:32:54,650
Commander Hu wants the Kunlun Mountains.

602
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:55,910
So they won't be in danger

603
00:32:56,170 --> 00:32:57,850
for the moment.

604
00:33:12,170 --> 00:33:12,970
Brother.

605
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:15,020
Is that girl

606
00:33:16,370 --> 00:33:18,090
really so important to you?

607
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,580
I can't let anything happen to them.

608
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,600
Them?

609
00:33:24,850 --> 00:33:25,310
Yes.

610
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,110
Them.

611
00:33:26,870 --> 00:33:27,920
I don't want them to die

612
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,760
because of the non-existent Kunlun Mountains.

613
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,470
How do you know

614
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,360
there is no Kunlun Mountians?

615
00:33:42,070 --> 00:33:43,880
I'll go check on Commander Hu first.

616
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,440
Don't act rashly.

617
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:48,580
Wait for my message.

618
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:25,330
[Garrison Headquarters]

619
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:52,750
Brother.

620
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:55,480
You're here to save me.

621
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:56,909
Ma.

622
00:34:56,909 --> 00:34:58,680
I told you, you can't lock me up.

623
00:34:58,680 --> 00:34:59,560
Let go of me.

624
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,700
Let's go.

625
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:02,920
Hurry!

626
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:05,940
Hurry up.

627
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:08,170
What do you mean?

628
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,390
No.

629
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:13,230
Wu Shuang.

630
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:14,480
You...

631
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:15,620
Brother.

632
00:35:16,820 --> 00:35:17,310
Let's go.

633
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,420
Well...

634
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,260
Brother soldier.

635
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,310
We're a family.

636
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:21,930
Why don't you lock us up together?

637
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,130
Go in.

638
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:27,320
Wu Shuang, sleep on the corner at night.

639
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:28,870
Cover it up. It's cold here.

640
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,630
Brother.

641
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,910
I thought you came to save me.

642
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:50,880
Why are you locked up here?

643
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,410
Aren't you quite capable?

644
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,570
I came in one day earlier than you.

645
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,920
I know this place well.

646
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,640
If you need anything

647
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:05,160
or if you want to talk or miss me,

648
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,840
just knock on the wall.

649
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:09,990
OK.

650
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:11,670
He Biao.

651
00:36:13,390 --> 00:36:14,610
Aren't you good at Kung Fu?

652
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,330
Why don't you drill out?

653
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:21,370
Ma.

654
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,760
I have a ring.

655
00:36:23,010 --> 00:36:23,810
I give you the ring.

656
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:24,980
Can you bring Wu Shuang,

657
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,870
the pretty girl to me?

658
00:36:29,730 --> 00:36:31,910
Auntie Hei, why are you here too?

659
00:36:32,210 --> 00:36:33,510
After you left home this morning,

660
00:36:33,510 --> 00:36:35,400
a group of soldiers rushed into our house

661
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,450
and brought us here.

662
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:44,220
My lady, did they hurt you?

663
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,160
Commander.

664
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:22,860
Commander.

665
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,140
Shush.

666
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,520
What are you doing?

667
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,700
What are you doing?

668
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,870
I'm waiting for the news.

669
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,470
Tell me

670
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,780
how many treasures did you find?

671
00:37:36,210 --> 00:37:37,850
Not yet.

672
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,610
Just some pots.

673
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:42,680
They said there's a big tomb down there.

674
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,450
It hasn't been dug out yet.

675
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:48,010
Two corps of engineers went.

676
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,610
Xue Dingfeng

677
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:50,910
is watching over there.

678
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,440
They've confirmed that there's a tomb down there.

679
00:37:55,070 --> 00:37:56,250
They are digging.

680
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,670
What are you talking about?

681
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,860
Just blow it up.

682
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,380
I want to blow it up too.

683
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,640
I wanted to blow it up long ago.

684
00:38:10,150 --> 00:38:12,960
What if it the treasures be destroyed?

685
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,240
Hang in there.

686
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:17,670
Wait.

687
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,170
Director.

688
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,740
What is Fatty Hu doing?

689
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,580
He left us here.

690
00:38:51,350 --> 00:38:53,910
That's because he hasn't opened up the big tomb.

691
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,390
After that,

692
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,560
what will he do?

693
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,080
Who knows?

694
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:03,910
You're the Director of the Police Department.

695
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,050
The lady is Her Ladyship's special member.

696
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,730
What can he do?

697
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,990
The Director allowed his brother to trade opium.

698
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,180
The special member deceived Her Ladyship

699
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,940
and colluded with the Penta-sect

700
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:20,830
to steal the Han tomb

701
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,600
in the name of exterminating tomb robbers.

702
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:24,650
Besides, Commander Hu

703
00:39:24,650 --> 00:39:26,040
put all the previous charges

704
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,430
on us.

705
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,610
Think about it.

706
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,590
Will the title of Director and the special member

707
00:39:33,770 --> 00:39:35,660
still be a talisman?

708
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:38,640
Then...

709
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,210
Are you scared?

710
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:43,510
I'm not.

711
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:44,730
I've been with you for so many years.

712
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:45,990
I've never been afraid of death.

713
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:47,960
But dying like this

714
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,220
is aggravating.

715
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:53,800
It's too early

716
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,730
to talk about death now.

717
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,080
There is room for maneuvering.

718
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:02,120
Only after he opens that tomb

719
00:40:03,210 --> 00:40:04,760
we'll know what he wants.

720
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:08,670
Let's eat.

721
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:30,970
Wu Shuang.

722
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,040
What is the tomb Commander Hu mentioned?

723
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:35,720
Is it really there?

724
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,270
You're still not going to tell me?

725
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,100
Yes.

726
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:48,780
And

727
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,710
it should be a big tomb.

728
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:54,070
Why didn't you tell me?

729
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:57,810
Yunqi was worried that if you knew

730
00:40:57,810 --> 00:40:59,190
there's a bigger tomb,

731
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:00,790
you will open the tomb

732
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,920
and give the treasures to the government.

733
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,100
In that case,

734
00:41:03,270 --> 00:41:04,780
everyone will be in danger.

735
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,920
What danger?

736
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,570
Just like now.

737
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:11,250
Yunqi said...

738
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,810
once a treasure is dug out from the tomb,

739
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,400
Commander Hu won't let you

740
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:16,410
and your brother go.

741
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:18,640
He wouldn't dare.

742
00:41:20,190 --> 00:41:22,060
I thought so at first.

743
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,530
Yunqi and Master didn't allow us to come.

744
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:27,460
I thought they were overly worried.

745
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,350
But now

746
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,480
look at us.

747
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,500
We've been locked up here.

748
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,680
Why do you think he dares not?

749
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,620
Wu Shuang.

750
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:40,310
I'm sorry.

751
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:42,240
I dragged you down.

752
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,390
Fengling.

753
00:41:48,670 --> 00:41:50,770
Don't say that.

754
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,660
Look at us now.

755
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:54,290
We're good at one time and bad at another.

756
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,720
I thought it was fun.

757
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,230
Really.

758
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:08,280
[Zhu's]

759
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:16,600
-Sit. -Yunqi.

760
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,240
Uncle.

761
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,720
I think

762
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:22,810
you already know

763
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,110
what's going on now.

764
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:25,960
I know

765
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:27,680
a little bit.

766
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:31,340
Uncle has many informants.

767
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,810
I wonder if there's any new news.

768
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,340
There's no need to say that.

769
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,310
Today,

770
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:39,910
I'm not in the mood

771
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,710
beating around the bush with you.

772
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,530
Wu shuang is now captured.

773
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,460
I'm also anxious.

774
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,210
Do you think

775
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:48,810
I have the mood to beat around the bush with you?

776
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:54,100
Xuewen.

777
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:57,670
Wu Shuang and Luo Yunsong

778
00:42:57,670 --> 00:42:59,560
were locked up in the Commander's cell.

779
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:01,830
Luo Jiutian was also locked there.

780
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:03,050
They also captured

781
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:04,430
Luo Yunsong's adjutant

782
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,520
and the servants of the Luo family.

783
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,830
Until dinner,

784
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:08,210
no one was tortured or interrogated.

785
00:43:08,550 --> 00:43:10,480
Commander Hu should be back to Garrison Headquarters

786
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,360
at 7:00 p.m.

787
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,630
There should be

788
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:15,100
There should be a company of guards back to Garrison Headquarters.

789
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,600
Tell him.

790
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,420
Commander Hu

791
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:25,350
sent two companies of engineers to the Small Kunlun

792
00:43:25,490 --> 00:43:26,900
and they were led by Xue Dingfeng.

793
00:43:27,570 --> 00:43:30,050
Now half of the layer of dust of the main tomb underground

794
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:31,230
has been cleaned up.

795
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,500
But they haven't found the entrance to the tomb.

796
00:43:35,050 --> 00:43:36,350
What do you think?

797
00:43:41,270 --> 00:43:42,610
Commander Hu's target

798
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:44,370
is money, not human.

799
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,400
He detained Luo Yunsong

800
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,910
to find someone

801
00:43:48,910 --> 00:43:50,420
to take the blame for him.

802
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,230
In the whole process,

803
00:43:53,020 --> 00:43:54,030
whom he cares the least

804
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,500
is Wu Shuang.

805
00:43:56,850 --> 00:43:57,560
So,

806
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,580
if possible,

807
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,230
I want to switch Wu Shuang back.

808
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:05,040
How?

809
00:44:06,040 --> 00:44:07,770
If he can't open up that Han tomb,

810
00:44:08,190 --> 00:44:09,870
he will still take the lives of Luo Yunsong's family.

811
00:44:11,630 --> 00:44:14,230
Yunqi, he has thousands of people now.

812
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,410
He has guns and cannons.

813
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:17,300
How can you fight with him?

814
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,640
Xuewen.

815
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,420
Uncle is right.

816
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:29,690
But Uncle is wrong about one thing.

817
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,390
What Commander Hu really wants

818
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,490
is the Kunlun Mountains that no one has seen.
