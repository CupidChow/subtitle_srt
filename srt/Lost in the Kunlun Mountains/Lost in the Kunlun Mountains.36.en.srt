Where's Wu Shuang? Why didn't she come back together?

Shijiu heard that he was leaving the cave

and cried her tears out.

Brother, is everything going well over there?

Yes.

Black Feather and ghouls

00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,600
are getting ready.

14
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,740
They will pick up the Yu family tomorrow morning.

15
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:07,270
As you said, they'll send them out of the city.

I'm relieved.

You are hiding something from me.

26

30
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:42,130
Are you afraid that I'll run away too?

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,760
You will only send me and Wu Shuang away

32
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,290

risking your life for justice.

37
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,710
I'm telling you, no.

38
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,460
No way.

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,230
Zhou Qiuhai killed my father.

40
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:02,530
I must kill him myself.

41
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,080
Brother, you misunderstood me.

42
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,760
That's the only way.

43
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:12,360
Because I can't think of it.

44

45
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,100
Tell me if you have a plan.

46
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:35,620
I've sent a message to Zhou Qiuhai and Her Ladyship.

47
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,620
Three days later,

48
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:39,290
I will open the Kunlun Mountains.

49
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,180
Because the tide rises in three days.

50
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,990
The tide will flood Dulong Cave again.

51
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,890
Even if Her Ladyship knows where the cave is,

52
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,320
she can't find the way in.

53
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:51,880
In this way, we can

54
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,880
work together against Zhou Qiuhai.

55
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,350
But there's always what-ifs.

56
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,930
So I asked Shiqi to put a wooden boat

57
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,980
at the entrance.

58
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:01,290
If we can go together,

59
00:04:01,830 --> 00:04:02,760
that's the best.

60
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,780
But if the plan changes,

61
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,840
you must promise me

62

I'll tell you later.

175
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:12,900
Go.

176
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,140
Drink some water.

177
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,120
Take a rest.

178
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,040
Be careful of the trap.

179
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,980
Be careful.

180
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:13,670
Go ahead. Be careful.

181
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:30,650
Brother.

182
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,370
Brother!

183
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,500
Brother!

184
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,280
Brother!

185
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,630
Brother!

186
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,330
Brother!

187
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:10,270
The Kunlun Mountains!

188
00:24:10,570 --> 00:24:12,710
The Kunlun Mountains!

189
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:17,620
I finally see you.

190
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,090
Ding Yunqi.

191
00:26:48,310 --> 00:26:49,660
Are you alone?

192
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,240
To deal with you,

193
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,430
only me is enough.

194
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,310
Fight with me?

195
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,260
Do you still want to fight?

196
00:28:14,750 --> 00:28:15,760
Open the door.

197
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,580
Open the door!

198
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,990
Okay.

199
00:28:38,810 --> 00:28:39,700
Open it.

200
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:41,590
Here.

201
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,570
Is this the Heaven Official's headquarters?

202
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:29,470
The Heaven Official is the last barrier.

203
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,420
Behind the first Heaven Officer

204
00:30:33,430 --> 00:30:35,690
is the entrance to the Kunlun Mountains.

205
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,570
What are you waiting for?

206
00:30:39,650 --> 00:30:40,400
Come.

207
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,290
Here.

208
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:45,950
Open it and let me see the treasures.

209
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,080
Here.

210
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:59,060
The Ding family has guarded the Kunlun Mountains for hundreds of years.

211
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,900
Today, I wasn't forced by force to open it.

212
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,960
I did it willingly.

213
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,200
Fine.

214
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,860
You can say whatever you want.

215
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:10,980
Just open it

216
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,610
and let me see the treasures.

217
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,600
Okay.

218
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:18,240
Kneel before my father

219
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,430
and ancestors of Penta-sect.

220
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,050
What?

221
00:31:26,770 --> 00:31:27,900
Kneel.

222
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,410
Yes.

223
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,880
Kneel.

224
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,440
Yunqi.

225
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,430
Are you in position

226
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,400
to negotiate with me now?

227
00:31:43,950 --> 00:31:45,290
Are you kneeling or not?

228
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:51,090
Just for the decency

229
00:31:51,090 --> 00:31:53,400
of the Ding family?

230
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,460
It's not decency,

231
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,020
but dignity.

232
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,610
You don't understand.

233
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:06,330
Yunqi.

234
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:08,980
Dignity

235
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:11,370
is for the winner.

236
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,540
With your current condition,

237
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,160
you'll never able to enjoy it

238
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:18,010
in your life.

239
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,460
And you also humiliated your Ding Family of hundreds of years of history.

240
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:23,430
Zhou Qiuhai.

241
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:26,560
You have no right to talk about dignity with me,

242
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,760
nor to criticize my family.

243
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:32,790
Fine.

244
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:34,220
Good.

245
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:42,660
Yunqi.

246
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:44,550
Be good.

247
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:45,680
Okay?

248
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:49,080
As long as you open the Kunlun Mountains,

249
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,800
I guarantee your ancestral temple will not be destroyed.

250
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,900
I'll grant you the soul of the Ding family

251
00:32:57,910 --> 00:32:59,250
and a place to live.

252
00:33:00,930 --> 00:33:02,650
Don't be too willful, okay?

253
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:04,250
Yunqi.

254
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,980
If you don't kneel,

255
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,590
I'd rather the souls of the Ding Family

256
00:33:10,590 --> 00:33:11,850
have no places to live

257
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:14,120
than open the passage for you.

258
00:33:15,550 --> 00:33:16,760
Kill me.

259
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:20,840
Yunqi.

260
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,120
Stop worrying about decency and dignity, okay?

261
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,050
Kneel.

262
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,260
Yunqi.

263
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:49,470
Yunqi.

264
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,970
Yunqi!

265
00:33:59,310 --> 00:34:01,240
Don't challenge me.

266
00:34:14,650 --> 00:34:15,900
Sir, we found it.

267
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,350
Yes.

268
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,469
Be quick.

269
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,650
Pick up some things

270
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:27,830
in case it's a waste of time.

271
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,460
Yes.

272
00:34:30,050 --> 00:34:30,850
Let's go.

273

Keep up.

274
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:22,430
Kneel.

275
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:42,790
Okay.

276
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,480
I have been in Penta-sect

277
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,080
for decades.

278
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:49,050
Today,

279
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,550
this is the last time I worship the Heaven Official.

280
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:56,740
Kneel.

281
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,810
