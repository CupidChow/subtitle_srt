4
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,390
Wu Shuang.

5
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,450
Wu Shuang.

6
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,840
It's me.

7
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:06,800
Well...

8
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,430
You...

9
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,009
Stop struggling.

10
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,900
It's useless.

11
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,120
Gui tried this medicine.

12
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,970
He just couldn't move or talk.

13
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:15,830
Yeah.

14
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,050
Don't struggle.

15
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:23,550
What are you waiting for?

16
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:25,020
Keep watching outside.

17
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:25,610
Go.

18
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,740
I apologize to you first.

19
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,910
Well, just now,

20
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,000
including soda,

21
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,720
other food

22
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:41,400
were all drugged.

23
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:43,040
Knockout drops.

24
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,570
I have no choice.

25
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:47,660
I like you so much.

26
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,380
First bow to heaven and earth.

27
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,310
My father is dead.

28
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:14,370
Second bow to parents.

29
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:20,800
Bow to each other.

30
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,070
I've never seen you so close.

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,500
You're so pretty.

32
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:37,510
Don't cry.

33
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,460
No.

34
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,280
From now on,

35
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,840
you are my

36
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,530
wife.

37
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,980
I proposed marriage.

38
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,000
Your master accepted my betrothal gifts.

39
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,610
I've been waiting for so long.

40
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,970
Fine. It's worth it.

41
00:04:13,970 --> 00:04:15,700
It's worth waiting for so long.

42
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,600
Don't cry.

43
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,670
I swear.

44
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,740
I, Luo Jiutian, I swear,

45
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,100
I will never go to

46
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,750
brothel to meet any prostitute.

47
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,590
I will treat you well wholeheartedly.

48
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,830
I'll be good for the rest of my life.

49
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:02,940
Let's start.

50
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:18,230
Let's start from here.

51
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,040
Why are these shoelaces so tight?

52
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,040
What?

53
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:27,550
Let's go there.

54
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,200
Maybe there's something else.

55
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,410
It's not good for us to go there.

56
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,300
What good things could happen to my brother?

57
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,860
I didn't expect him to be so bold.

58
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,920
I regret it so much.

59
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:37,500
Regret what?

60
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,600
I regret not telling my brother

61
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:39,930
about his tomb robbery.

62
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:48,720
Miss.

63
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,250
Luo Jiutian!

64
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,280
Shameless!

65
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,080
What's wrong?

66
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,590
Wu Shuang!

67
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,430
Bastard!

68
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,390
What?

69
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,190
No.

70
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:08,330
You don't understand.

71
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:10,010
Wait for our brother to come back and teach you a lesson.

72
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:11,150
What does it have to do with our brother?

73
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,660
We've been married.

74
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,170
My father saw us in heaven.

75
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,720
I will let your father in heaven

76
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,230
knows

77
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:24,000
how you died.

78
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,760
No, sister Wu Shuang.

79
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,680
Good sister.

80
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,280
Please let him go for my sake.

81
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,390
Please spare his life, my dear sister.

82
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:33,150
Good sister.

83
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,350
Wu Shuang.

84
00:06:37,690 --> 00:06:38,490
Gui.

85
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:39,030
Gui.

86
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:39,790
Come.

87
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,110
Are you okay?

88
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,850
The masked man helped me twice secretly.

89
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,840
It must be related to my father.

90
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,820
I feel comforted.

91
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:54,870
At least

92
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,600
I will not so worried about my father.

93
00:06:58,650 --> 00:06:59,300
If

94
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:01,380
this person really has something to do Master Ding,

95
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,170
why didn't he come out

96
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:03,160
and meet us?

97
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,180
There must be another secret.

98
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,750
What is the reason?

99
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:09,650
Okay, Yunqi.

100
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:10,830
Don't worry.

101
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,930
My brothers will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow.

102
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:14,020
When we have enough manpower,

103
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,020
it'll be easier to find Master Ding.

104
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,320
Wu Shuang.

105
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,110
You...

106
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,970
What are you waiting for? Come in.

107
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,260
What are you doing?

108
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,220
Come in.

109
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,360
Come on.

110
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,040
What happened?

111
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:51,980
What's wrong?

112
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,550
It's embarrassing.

113
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,140
Tell me.

114
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,060
Luo Jiutian bullied me.

115
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,380
What did he do to you?

116
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,720
He lied to me that the dragon bones were in his house

117
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,650
and took me to his room

118
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:14,830
and drugged me,

119
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,720
and tied me up.

120
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,110
Fortunately, Fengling arrived in time and saved me.

121
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,210
Yunqi.

122
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,930
Yunqi, where are you going?

123
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:27,850
Bastard!

124
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:31,670
Brother.

125
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,230
One more thing.

126
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,360
Go ahead.

127
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,210
He stole the tomb.

128
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,220
What did you say?

129
00:08:42,850 --> 00:08:44,360
Song County Jiuling Twelve Mountain,

130
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,160
the two tombs of the Qing Dynasty

131
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,530
were stolen by brother with Xue Dingfeng.

132
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,650
Are you sure?

133
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:53,090
Huanghe Sigui were also involved.

134
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,150
They haven't sold anything yet.

135
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:57,120
Auntie Hei knows where they hid it.

136
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,770
She saw it. A whole box.

137
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,130
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

138
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:28,880
Mr. Ding.

139
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,010
What's wrong with everyone today?

140
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,610
Director.

141
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,740
Brother.

142
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,680
You...

143
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,390
You know

144
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,030
I proposed to Wu Shuang.

145
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,250
Listen, Miss Wu Shuang

146
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,970
is intact.

147
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:52,520
Look at me. I was beaten up.

148
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,500
Young... Young Master.

149
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Young Master!

150
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,830
Call an ambulance!

151
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,790
I didn't expect you to be so fair.

152
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,970
He should be punished for his mistakes.

153
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,100
Everyone should be.

154
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:26,540
My leg.

155
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,870
Apologize to Wu Shuang.

156
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,470
I was wrong.

157
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:36,450
I won't do it again.

158
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,150
If you do it again,

159
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,660
I'll kill you.

160
00:10:42,790 --> 00:10:44,680
I know.

161
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:48,130
Let's go.

162
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:51,950
Brother.

163
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:53,500
Young Master.

164
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,430
It hurts!

165
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,230
Biao.

166
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:55,860
Yes.

167
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,490
Take Xue Dingfeng and confiscate his property

168
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,330
and go straight to the station.

169
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:58,880
Yes.

170
00:10:58,880 --> 00:10:59,550
Director...

171
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,350
Shut up.

172
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,530
Don't let me see you again.

173
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:03,710
and your four stupid disciples.

174
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,350
Director, I have nothing to do with it.

175
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:07,660
About the tomb of Qing Dynasty.

176
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,310
Qing...

177
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:18,530
Young master, please save me.

178
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,790
Save me first.

179
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:20,590
Young Master.

180
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:30,000
Sister Wu Shuang .

181
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Sister Wu Shuang.

182
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:35,330
Sister Wu Shuang.

183
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,230
My brother is a jerk.

184
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:39,830
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,260
I...

186
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,870
You are you, he is him.

187
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,040
We can still tell.

188
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,030
I just...

189
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:52,090
I was so afraid that my brother

190
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:53,440
would shoot him.

191
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,240
Yunqi.

192
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:03,430
I've thought about

193
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,210
what you told me last night.

194
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,250
You're right.

195
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,090
Three days later,

196
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:12,670
I'll try to return the dragon bones to you in three days.

197
00:12:15,650 --> 00:12:16,410
You...

198
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,320
You don't believe me?

199
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:20,230
I do, but you may not get it.

200
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,040
I'll try.

201
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,130
Three days later,

202
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,490
at 7 p.m. on the 12th.

203
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,920
at the coffee shop

204
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,050
we first met.

205
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:30,180
Let's see if I can get anything

206
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,650
at that time.

207
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,830
Sister Wu Shuang.

208
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:47,820
Your brother has been punished.

209
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,740
I won't take it to heart.

210
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,060
Don't worry.

211
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,800
We're leaving.

212
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,570
Let me see you off.

213
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:59,720
No need. You should go back now.

214
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:13,400
Thank you.

215
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,620
Take it.

216
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,460
There's a huge bug inside.

217
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,230
Where?

218
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:28,980
Look.

219
00:13:29,570 --> 00:13:30,960
-Thin and slim.
-Where?

220
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,550
I didn't see it.

221
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,020
Look.

222
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:39,760
It's not funny at all.

223
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,790
I am not good at jokes.

224
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:46,710
Come.

225
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:52,210
Then tell me something interesting.

226
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,220
Let me think about it.

227
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:01,310
No.

228
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,840
Someone found out about our house.

229
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:04,980
What?

230
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,850
We must have been followed.

231
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,970
he must have been followed when we came back from the banquet.

232
00:14:09,970 --> 00:14:10,650
Otherwise, how come that Luo Jiutian

233
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,910
was around there,

234
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:13,970
and even we met him by chance.

235
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:15,810
Yes.

236
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,000
Why didn't I think of that?

237
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:21,020
You and your brother

238
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,870
won't be followed.

239
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,260
That should be San Jin.

240
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,280
What should we do?

241
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,420
Should we move to another place?

242
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:32,910
No.

243
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,470
Let's go and tell you a joke.

244
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:38,830
Let's go.

245
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,040
Director,

246
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,340
all the stolen items

247
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,270
from the tombs of the Qing Dynasty.

248
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:18,390
What are these?

249
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:21,500
They all think that

250
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,300
everything they got from the tombs are good stuff.

251
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
I don't know why they think that way.

252
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,560
Even if Kunlun Mountains really exist,

253
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,760
the things inside...

254
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:32,750
must be disappointing.

255
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,080
Xue Dingfeng left?

256
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,040
Yes.

257
00:15:37,330 --> 00:15:39,140
Tonight we are going to bell tower ahead of time to arrest.

258
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,540
Take Black Feather Team.

259
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,370
But no matter what happens,

260
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,300
remember this.

261
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:44,680
Don't shoot.

262
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,830
Don't alert the police in the concession.

263
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,500
Yes.

264
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,640
Also,

265
00:15:50,390 --> 00:15:51,990
after arresting Ding Yunqi,

266
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:54,550
take him to the bureau and lock him up.

267
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:55,560
What about the rest of his family?

268
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,650
Lock all of them up.

269
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,810
If Wu Shuang is there,

270
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:07,440
let her go.

271
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,330
Last time in the private bank,

272
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:16,940
we were arrogant and talked in a bureaucratic way with the little girl,

273
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,990
I feel sorry for it.

274
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,890
Now, Jiutian has done such a filthy thing.

275
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,210
I'm sorry for the kid.

276
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,180
Yes.

277
00:16:29,330 --> 00:16:30,840
[Boat ticket]

278
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,940
The most annoying thing now

279
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:45,790
is not Zhou Qiuhai,

280
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,850
Not Ding Yunqi.

281
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,570
It's my precious sister, Fengling.

282
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,740
My head hurts thinking about her.

283
00:16:57,380 --> 00:16:58,220
Boat ticket.

284
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,980
Four days left.

285
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,020
How do we survive these four days?

286
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:07,630
After we catch Ding Yunqi tonight,

287
00:17:07,630 --> 00:17:09,359
we need to talk to her tomorrow.

288
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:13,339
How can she always think of herself as Mu Guiying?

289
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:29,580
How many do we have to make?

290
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,190
Before dark,

291
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:32,650
we must do as many as we can.

292
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,510
This is too simple.

293
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:37,660
This doesn't seem like something the heaven official would do.

294
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:39,460
A small punishment is enough.

295
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:42,070
The traps in the Penta-sect are too fierce.

296
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,110
They're too much.

297
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:45,740
The killing weapon is here.

298
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:48,240
Young Master.

299
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,120
Miss Wu Shuang.

300
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:51,430
What is this?

301
00:17:53,870 --> 00:17:54,870
A killing weapon.

302
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,610
The one master used to make is very powerful.

303
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,310
It can shoot ten arrows in one go.

304
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:04,790
I hired someone to get it from home.

305
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,190
You're getting smarter.

306
00:18:06,930 --> 00:18:07,900
Of course.

307
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,040
I'm not scared.

308
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,390
I just think we don't need to try something dangerous

309
00:18:12,390 --> 00:18:14,150
if it is not necessary, right?

310
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,420
That's not right.

311
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,640
Miss Wu Shuang,

312
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,360
do you think that

313
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,000
they found us

314
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,800
because they followed me back??

315
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,530
Impossible.

316
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,890
Young Master.

317
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:29,860
I think so too.

318
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,630
I was very careful.

319
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:33,180
so I changed several paths.

320
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,910
Do you think

321
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:38,180
it is Master San?

322
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:40,030
He is carefree.

323
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,830
Maybe he fell into their trap.

324
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,370
It's very likely. I think it's him too.

325
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,920
You think so too, right?

326
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,280
See,

327
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,610
he comes all the way just to eat our supper.

328
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:55,170
Does that make sense?

329
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,200
It's my fault.

330
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,670
My buns

331
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,400
are just so tasty.

332
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:01,780
No one can

333
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:03,640
resist the temptation of my buns.

334
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,440
That's right.

335
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,740
Your buns are

336
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,830
enemy to brother.

337
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:10,730
All right, hurry up.

338
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,930
Put it on.

339
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,100
Smart.

340
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:53,860
San Jin.

341
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,250
He's here.

342
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:56,930
Here.

343
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:58,980
Here.

344
00:19:58,980 --> 00:19:59,950
Do it again.

345
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:01,800
Do it again.

346
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:10,160
Are you serious?

347
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,710
Why not?

348
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,850
Will you risk your life?

349
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,150
I'll exchange with you.

350
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:17,210
Exchange?

351
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:19,060
You can't just change it.

352
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,750
I'm from the Ding family.

353
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,390
Let's go.

354
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,100
They're really here.

355
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,240
They are trapped already.

356
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,440
Get some rest. I'll do it.

357
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,890
Those who are injured, retreat first. Be careful of the trap.

358
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,900
-Yes.
-Yes.

359
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,620
Let's go.

360
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,560
See you.

361
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,700
Young Master.

362
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:25,520
Sleep in peace.

363
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,480
They won't come again.

364
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,210
Are you sure they won't come, Young Master?

365
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:29,610
Don't worry. Go to sleep.

366
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm very good now.

367
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:49,880
Come on!

368
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,120
I didn't expect him to be prepared.

369
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,110
He didn't want to kill us.

370
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,000
He just wants to tell us

371
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,980
he knows our action very well.

372
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,410
Indeed.

373
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:11,930
If he wanted to kill us,

374
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,400
it wouldn't be like it is right now.

375
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,980
This guy is interesting.

376
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:19,650
He's not one we can defeat quickly.

377
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,170
It's fine.

378
00:23:22,510 --> 00:23:23,970
Send Fengling away first.

379
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,210
I have plenty of time to play with him.

380
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:32,000
Mr. Chen's case was solved last time.

381
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,560
He sent us some gold.

382
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,080
It is yours.

383
00:23:36,830 --> 00:23:37,880
Thank you, director.

384
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,060
I don't need money.

385
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,220
Then find a way to spend money.

386
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:46,030
Just spend it.

387
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:47,790
Yes.

388
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,350
Hello, Captain He.

389
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,150
OK.

390
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:11,480
It hurts.

391
00:24:22,570 --> 00:24:23,240
Who is it?

392
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,250
It's Captain He.

393
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:27,020
What is this? Show me.

394
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:36,760
He Biao.

395
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,230
You bastard!

396
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,920
You're rich, aren't you?

397
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,280
Are you trying to disgust me?

398
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,580
He insulted me.

399
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,200
Please insult me every day.

400
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,030
Who are you?

401
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:36,610
Director.

402
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:38,000
Director, he's gone.

403
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,640
Did you see his face clearly?

404
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:40,430
No.

405
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:42,240
Keep looking.

406
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,950
Yes.

407
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,560
What's wrong?

408
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,450
Someone was here just now.

409
00:25:52,450 --> 00:25:53,980
It must be for dragon bones.

410
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:56,900
How is it?

411
00:25:57,150 --> 00:25:58,070
It's safe.

412
00:25:58,450 --> 00:25:59,880
Arrange Black Feather Team to guard at night.

413
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:00,640
Yes.

414
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:06,340
You must go to Europe. Give me the dragon bones.

415
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:07,780
Sleep early.

416
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,910
Brother.

417
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:21,800
[Police Station]

418
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:06,030
Check what's going on with Huang

419
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:07,200
in Zone 3.

420
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,040
Tell me when you come back.

421
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,800
Yes.

422
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,590
You came here yourself.

423
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,350
Yes.

424
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:11,310
Aren't you afraid I'll catch you?

425
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,180
It's easy for you to catch me.

426
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,950
It's not hard for me to catch you, either.

427
00:28:14,950 --> 00:28:16,480
Do we have to talk like this?

428
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,750
Tell me, what do you want?

429
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:21,990
I want the dragon bones.

430
00:28:25,110 --> 00:28:26,330
Anything else?

431
00:28:29,020 --> 00:28:31,280
It seems that you won't listen to Chu Fengling anymore.

432
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,170
I don't need to care about

433
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,370
her promise anymore.

434
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:34,730
Whatever.

435
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,310
But I have to say,

436
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,450
my father must have...

437
00:28:41,450 --> 00:28:43,650
I don't want to talk about this with you.

438
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,490
I know,

439
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,810
you won't believe anything I say.

440
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:49,690
How about this?

441
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,150
After I find my father,

442
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,380
I'll bring him here to explain to you.

443
00:28:54,340 --> 00:28:56,020
Do you take me as a fool?

444
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,550
My father didn't show up even when I was published on the newspaper.

445
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,880
I don't know where he is.

446
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:03,070
But I guess he's not in Shanghai.

447
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:05,640
You lured him with the dragon bone, but he didn't show up.

448
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:07,700
Why don't you give it back to me first?

449
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:14,000
What if I don't?

450
00:29:16,770 --> 00:29:18,490
Let me make this clear.

451
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,340
There are other methods I can use

452
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,940
to retrieve the dragon bone.

453
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,600
You forgot one thing.

454
00:29:27,310 --> 00:29:29,370
Fengling saved your life last time.

455
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:31,680
That's why you escaped the disaster.

456
00:29:33,070 --> 00:29:34,070
I know.

457
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:34,870
And you plan to

458
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:36,300
to break my limbs.

459
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,480
Yes, you're lucky.

460
00:29:38,990 --> 00:29:40,080
You're lucky.

461
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:41,800
If you really do that,

462
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,240
I promise you'll end up worse than me.

463
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,600
You have a good sister

464
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,850
that helped you escape the disaster.

465
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:49,860
Ding Yunqi.

466
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,000
Let me ask you.

467
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,690
What do you mean by

468
00:29:55,070 --> 00:29:56,080
in other ways?

469
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:59,270
If the law of this society

470
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:01,200
is represented by people like you,

471
00:30:01,250 --> 00:30:02,420
I won't keep it.

472
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,870
Let me tell you clearly.

473
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,120
I really welcome you to break the law.

474
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,500
I hope this day won't come.

475
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:22,450
It's not fresh anymore. Take it.

476
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,460
Brother.

477
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:55,420
Fengling.

478
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:57,480
Can I see you alone

479
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,910
in your office?

480
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:02,350
I've been busy these days. My work has been piled up.

481
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,410
Tell me. What is it?

482
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:05,840
Just nothing

483
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,230
but dragon bones.

484
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:09,410
You've been avoiding me these days.

485
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:12,210
When are you going to give me back the dragon bones?

486
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:14,740
Fengling.

487
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,050
Dragon bones are the only thing

488
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,310
to lure Ding Yunqi.

489
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,570
We can't give it to him.

490
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:21,670
Brother, I beg you.

491
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,310
I beg you.

492
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,670
Brother, if you do this,

493
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,440
I can only ask Madam to tell you.

494
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:35,580
How about today? Is it OK?

495
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:37,420
I'll go get it now.

496
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,230
I don't have it in hand.

497
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:40,830
I will tell He Biao

498
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:41,830
to take you there.

499
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:43,260
OK.

500
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,150
Biao.

501
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,960
where have you been staying with my brother these days?

502
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,420
The place we are going now.

503
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:55,950
Where?

504
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:57,580
My home.

505
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,010
You have a home?

506
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:02,030
The house director gave to me

507
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:03,690
when I first came to Shanghai.

508
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:04,640
I rarely go back.

509
00:32:06,990 --> 00:32:07,870
It seems that there are a lot

510
00:32:07,870 --> 00:32:09,400
that I don't know about you.

511
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:56,890
Biao.

512
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,610
Your house is nice.

513
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,450
I don't want to lie to you.

514
00:33:10,450 --> 00:33:11,910
Dragon bones are not here.

515
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:12,970
What?

516
00:33:13,850 --> 00:33:16,180
You have to go to Europe tomorrow morning.

517
00:33:16,790 --> 00:33:18,260
The director has arranged everything.

518
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,190
The thing in Europe is over.

519
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,390
Why should I go to Europe again?

520
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,770
The director is worried about your safety.

521
00:33:24,770 --> 00:33:25,700
If he returns dragon bones to them,

522
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,000
we will be all safe.

523
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,760
Why would he rather I go to Europe

524
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,220
than return dragon bones?

525
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,120
What's wrong with him?

526
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,940
Is he crazy?

527
00:33:35,230 --> 00:33:37,760
And why does he have to go after Ding Yuanshan?

528
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,260
I don't know.

529
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:42,500
So,

530
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:44,340
I can't leave here

531
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,070
before the boat departes tomorrow.

532
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,070
Yes.

533
00:33:47,070 --> 00:33:48,530
No matter how hard you try,

534
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:49,970
I won't let you out.

535
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:52,950
He Biao.

536
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:54,170
I'm a soldier.

537
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,380
I only obey orders regardless of right or wrong.

538
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,949
This smell is weird.

539
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:10,480
It tastes like medicine.

540
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,270
Is it good?

541
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,710
I don't care.

542
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:16,770
I can drink it even if foreigners can.

543
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,150
Mr. Ding.

544
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,030
Where is Miss Chu?

545
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,260
She is missing.

546
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,909
She hasn't seen Master for two days.

547
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:32,050
She's worried that she can't keep her promise when she

548
00:34:32,050 --> 00:34:33,190
meet you today.

549
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,290
She called Master this afternoon

550
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,010
and forced him to hand over dragon bones.

551
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,190
He agreed.

552
00:34:38,730 --> 00:34:40,620
Then He Biao came to pick her up.

553
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,690
I noticed she hasn't come back yet,

554
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,489
so I called Master.

555
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:47,719
He said

556
00:34:48,139 --> 00:34:49,600
she will be back tomorrow.

557
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,710
He told me to wait at home.

558
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,429
Did something really happen?

559
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,510
They are siblings after all.

560
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,600
No matter what,

561
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,130
Miss Chu won't be in danger.

562
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:02,880
She may look weak,

563
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,810
but she's very stubborn.

564
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:06,330
Master is forcing her.

565
00:35:06,830 --> 00:35:09,290
I'm really worried something might happen.

566
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:11,870
I really feel uneasy.

567
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:14,010
I came to beg you

568
00:35:14,390 --> 00:35:16,030
thinking she should have been meeting you today.

569
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:17,490
What car did He Biao drive?

570
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,720
Miss's car.

571
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,270
A gift from Master.

572
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,160
What is the license plate number?

573
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,210
6327.

574
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,600
There's a cutting paper on the window.

575
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,820
It is a magpie.

576
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,900
I pasted it on New Year's Eve. I didn't remove it.

577
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,190
Yunqi.

578
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:32,780
Fengling is against with Luo Yunsong

579
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,300
because she was looking for dragon bones.

580
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,470
We have to help her.

581
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,010
Eat something.

582
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:47,830
You haven't eaten today.

583
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,490
Eat.

584
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,960
I dare not eat.

585
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:01,660
I didn't put anything else.

586
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,410
I don't trust you anymore.

587
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,150
But I've never lied to you.

588
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,920
Tomorrow morning,

589
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:17,640
how are you going to get me on the boat?

590
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,820
I'll give you a medicine

591
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,280
and send you to the boat when you fall asleep.

592
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:24,610
How are you going to trick me to take that medicine?

593
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:25,410
I'm not lying.

594
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,460
If you don't eat it...

595
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:30,370
Then what?

596
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,360
I'll force you to eat.

597
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,450
How are you going to force me to eat?

598
00:36:36,750 --> 00:36:38,090
Are you going to use a gun against my head

599
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,270
or something?

600
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,840
Tell me.

601
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:45,660
Hold your chin and put the medicine in your mouth.

602
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,870
He Biao,

603
00:36:49,470 --> 00:36:50,690
you have to understand.

604
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,350
I don't want to do that either.

605
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,980
Then let me go, okay?

606
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,590
But I have to carry out my order.

607
00:37:01,150 --> 00:37:02,660
Between me and my brother,

608
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:04,930
you always choose him.

609
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,480
Right?

610
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,450
Sometimes I also want to...

611
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:12,990
But I can't.

612
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,170
Brother.

613
00:38:13,770 --> 00:38:14,440
Let's go.

614
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,320
-Yes.
-Yes.

615
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:17,130
Find the vehicles Yunqi asked for.

616
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:18,550
Don't miss

617
00:38:18,550 --> 00:38:19,690
any street alleys.

618
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:29,540
Let's go.

619
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,260
Can't you sleep more?

620
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,710
I fell asleep.

621
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,710
But I woke up by the smell of perfume.

622
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:46,080
I found it. Let's go.

623
00:39:55,850 --> 00:39:56,960
Eat something.

624
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:59,040
When you get on the boat,

625
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:01,240
I'm not sure when you can wake up.

626
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,850
I really don't want to go to Europe.

627
00:40:06,410 --> 00:40:08,410
No. Tie her up and give her medicine.

628
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,870
Can I not go?

629
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:14,510
Just make this mistake.

630
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,940
Just once.

631
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,710
But no matter how much she cries or makes a scene,

632
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:19,510
remember this,

633
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:20,840
don't be soft-hearted.

634
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:24,000
Send her to the boat tomorrow morning.

635
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:27,060
See if the boat leaves. Then you've completed the task.

636
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,770
He Biao!

637
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,000
No.

638
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,560
You're a stubborn donkey.

639
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,870
Can I not take the medicine?

640
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,000
I can walk on my own.

641
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,190
No, no.

642
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,670
Get two women to carry me up.

643
00:40:49,670 --> 00:40:51,300
You can't carry me up.

644
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:53,320
There are so many people on the boat.

645
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,620
I'll lose face.

646
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,130
What should I say

647
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:57,350
if someone asks me?

648
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,660
Is she banished to Europe?

649
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:04,620
He Biao?

650
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:17,050
Yes, this is the car.

651
00:41:19,770 --> 00:41:20,950
Brother, here it is.

652
00:41:24,730 --> 00:41:25,490
Wu Shuang!

653
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:27,800
He Biao has a gun. Be careful.

654
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,350
What are you afraid of?

655
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:30,950
I'll pester him. You guys save her.

656
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:33,970
[Wang Deli]

657
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:47,370
Don't cry.

658
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:49,090
The person who will save you is here.

659
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,190
I don't believe it.

660
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:52,920
Get out. They are outside.

661
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,460
Ding Yunqi, Auntie Hei,

662
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:55,650
and Wu Shuang.

663
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:57,830
Auntie Hei.

664
00:42:00,390 --> 00:42:01,320
Miss.

665
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,700
Auntie Hei.

666
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:13,230
Are you okay?

667
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:17,530
What took you so long?

668
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,380
I almost died.

669
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,660
What did He Biao do to you?

670
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,580
He...

671
00:42:23,950 --> 00:42:26,180
He's stubborn. He won't let me go.

672
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,490
It's okay. Let's go home.

673
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,800
I'm not going home.

674
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:32,480
I'm angry.

675
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,890
Where are you going if you don't go home?

676
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:38,570
Sister Wu Shuang.

677
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,650
Sister Wu Shuang, I'll go with you.

678
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:42,670
I live in Ding Yunqi's house.

679
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:44,470
I'll go wherever you go.

680
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,700
OK, go to my place first.

681
00:42:54,070 --> 00:42:54,910
He Biao.

682
00:42:55,810 --> 00:42:56,670
-He Biao.
-Forget it.

683
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:57,890
Leave him alone.

684
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:11,430
Brother, we're in trouble.

685
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,420
Not at all.
