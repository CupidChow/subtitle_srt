[Episode 25]

4
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:42,270
Do you know who did it?

5
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,080
It's a man called Tian Long.

6
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,770
How do you know?

7
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,080
Before Master Shou Wujiang passed away,

8
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:51,380
he left a letter written in blood.

9
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,850
He wanted to tell Lao Beifeng and Uncle Ding

10
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:53,940
that he was ambushed

11
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:55,200
and that his family might be in danger.

12
00:01:55,370 --> 00:01:56,340
He wanted to ask them for help.

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,240
But according to the current situation,

14
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,630
they definitely didn't see the letter.

15
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:05,120
Besides, Tian Long killed Luo Yunsong's whole family

16
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,590
and fabricated the scene.

17
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:08,350
That's why Luo Yunsong thought

18
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,660
Uncle Ding killed his family.

19
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,520
Tian Long.

20
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:20,030
Tian Long.

21
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,510
Master.

22
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:24,900
Have you heard of Tian Long?

23
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:28,510
I've heard of him in the early years.

24
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,320
I heard

25
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:33,470
this person excelled in martial arts

26
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,650
and had been coveting the Kunlun Mountains.

27
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,340
But I haven't heard

28
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:40,730
this name for many years. Wu Shuang.

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,579
Before your Uncle Ding passed away,

30
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,010
did he mention this person?

31
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:48,380
No, at least I didn't hear it.

32
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,320
Yunqi is openly looking for the Kunlun Mountains this time.

33
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,310
There must be many people watching out for it.

34
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,090
It'll also give us a lot of trouble.

35
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,650
If I had known Luo Yunsong

36
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,210
is Shou Wujiang's son, I would...

37
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,570
It's too late to say anything now.

38
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:15,590
There's nothing we can do to unite.

39
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:17,990
Then...

40
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,620
What should we do now, Master?

41
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,470
How is Luo Yunsong's relationship with Yunqi?

42
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,260
After they left the Dengkun Pavilion,

43
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,520
they buried the hatchet.

44
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,570
Luo Yunsong

45
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,460
wants to take revenge on Tian Long.

46
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,270
Before he finds Tian Long,

47
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,370
he will do his best to help Yunqi.

48
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,560
Good.

49
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,370
They can reunite.

50
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,680
It can also avoid

51
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,320
the tragedy of internecine struggles.

52
00:03:46,329 --> 00:03:47,890
What about Chu Fengling?

53
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:49,860
Fengling.

54
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,710
I don't know what's wrong with her lately.

55
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:53,010
She has a lot of resentment.

56
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,490
But the Black Feather Team takes orders only from Luo Yunsong.

57
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,840
She won't threaten you, Master.

58
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,700
It's hard to say.

59
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:04,180
The death of Auntie Hei has driven Chu Fengling crazy.

60
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:06,700
Maybe

61
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,800
she'll ask for troops from Her Ladyship.

62
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:14,470
Go back now.

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,250
If Chu Fengling takes any actions,

64
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,670
let me know.

65
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:20,769
Yes.

66
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,410
After reading the letter from Uncle Wujiang,

67
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,190
I feel that both Lao Beifeng and my father

68
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,870
know Tian Long.

69
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,570
They must be very familiar.

70
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:14,740
Otherwise, he wouldn't use

71
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,840
the willow catkins of the Ding family to frame Master Ding.

72
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:18,560
Yunqi.

73
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:20,500
Do you think Zhou Quihai

74
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,720
knows Tian Long?

75
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,880
My master doesn't know Tian Long.

76
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,150
Brother Luo.

77
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:31,000
My master has chosen

78
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,590
a tomb for Master Wujiang.

79
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,440
Because Master Wujiang

80
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,659
married and had children,

81
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:36,830
he broke the rules of the Penta-sect.

82
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,430
My master can't come.

83
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,490
He asked me to burn incense sticks for him.

84
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,880
Sect Leader Zhou is thoughtful.

85
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,820
By the way,

86
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,670
Master said he heard about Tian Long

87
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,640
when he was young,

88
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,020
but he's never seen him in person.

89
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,370
It is said that he excels in martial arts

90
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:54,350
and has been coveting the Kunlun Mountains.

91
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,740
But he hasn't had the information about him for years.

92
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,110
How is Sect Leader Zhou now?

93
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,250
Currently,

94
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,550
his injury isn't serious.

95
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,650
They've rushed back to the headquarters overnight.

96
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:09,380
Master said

97
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:11,310
Yunqi is openly looking for the Kunlun Mountains this time.

98
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,250
He'll definitely attract the attention

99
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,250
of people in the martial artists community.

100
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,310
So he asked us to be careful.

101
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:22,020
Don't be afraid.

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,250
Our brothers

103
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,480
and Brother's Black Feather Team will protect Yunqi.

104
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,370
I don't believe there is someone who dares to come and die.

105
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,110
Wu Shuang.

106
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,970
I didn't mean to hurt your master.

107
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:38,440
Who knew he would come from Nanshan?

108
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,730
Wu Shuang won't blame you.

109
00:06:39,730 --> 00:06:40,800
I'm blaming him.

110
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:42,940
He hurt my master.

111
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:45,670
Wu Shuang.

112
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:48,190
Brother set that formation for protecting me.

113
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,530
He didn't target your master.

114
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,790
That's right.

115
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,050
Besides,

116
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:53,270
your master shot the crossbows.

117
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,290
My men were injured too.

118
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:56,840
You deserve it.

119
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,650
You set up that formation

120
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,200
and caused so many casualties.

121
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:09,570
Brother Luo.

122
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,090
Auntie Hei's accident...

123
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,150
You said it was an accident.

124
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:17,670
We've buried Auntie Hei.

125
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:18,770
But

126
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,450
she had been with Fengling for so many years.

127
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,920
That's why Fengling...

128
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,150
Where is Fengling?

129
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,710
She's in her room.

130
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:28,970
I'll comfort her later.

131
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:29,810
I'll go.

132
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,530
At this time,

133
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:31,870
you'd better not go.

134
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,000
Brother, Yunqi.

135
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,310
I'll leave if there's nothing else. You guys talk.

136
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,409
Okay.

137
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,250
Ms. Chu.

138
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,110
Can't you wait a little longer?

139
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,520
I have difficulty walking.

140
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,410
Please forgive me.

141
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,720
Brother?

142
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:39,780
What's wrong?

143
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,000
Shouldn't you be happy to see me?

144
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,390
Why do you look like seeing a ghost?

145
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:44,320
Didn't

146
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,010
you die?

147
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,060
I'm not dead.

148
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,740
Brother.

149
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,130
It's really you.

150
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,640
What's going on?

151
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,160
I'm not dead. It's that simple.

152
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:09,260
Then...

153
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:10,820
Why are you here?

154
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:13,420
You left a mark and asked me to come.

155
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,580
It's you.

156
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:18,800
What's wrong?

157
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,110
Shouldn't you be happy to see me?

158
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,450
Although I changed my hairstyle,

159
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,850
come here, give me a big hug.

160
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:39,240
Thank you.

161
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:41,770
I saw you crying at my tomb.

162
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,770
You said you would avenge my death.

163
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,530
Although

164
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,260
you're a little girl,

165
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,020
you want to kill people for me.

166
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:53,910
I'm touched.

167
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:56,930
This is the first time

168
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,840
I feel there is someone

169
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:02,350
who still cares about me.

170
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:05,500
Stop crying.

171
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,680
Brother.

172
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,450
Auntie Hei is dead.

173
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,260
Yes, I saw it.

174
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,130
You saw it?

175
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,580
I've been following you

176
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:21,710
since you set off.

177
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,350
You're all in my line of sight.

178
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,830
Commander Hu

179
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:26,880
didn't kill me.

180
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,390
He told me

181
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:30,030
he wanted to put me in an important position.

182
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,180
But he gave me to Her Ladyship like a dog.

183
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:35,870
Her Ladyship also told me that she wanted to put me in an important position.

184
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,300
But she sent me here

185
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,140
like a dog

186
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,580
to protect you and follow you on the sly.

187
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,160
Don't just stand here.

188
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:49,640
My legs will be numb when I stand for too long.

189
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,030
Find a place to sit.

190
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,300
Walk slowly.

191
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:55,270
I

192
00:10:56,450 --> 00:10:57,540
limp.

193
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,180
It's really like the ups and downs

194
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:02,200
in our life. It's quite interesting.

195
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:04,430
Come here.

196
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,580
Have a seat.

197
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:20,550
Master,

198
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,150
don't worry.

199
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:28,320
Look.

200
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:30,550
Yunqi saved us today.

201
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,690
That means he's not setting himself against us.

202
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,250
I think this matter can be suspended.

203
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:37,190
You can persuade him

204
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:38,500
when he arrives at the headquarters.

205
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:41,850
Luo Yunsong

206
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,700
is Shou Wujiang's son.

207
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,720
He's following Ding Yunqi now.

208
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,440
Yunqi now

209
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,870
has one more soul pursuit order.

210
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,050
Do you think it'll be easier to persuade him?

211
00:11:55,290 --> 00:11:57,010
At first, he announced the disbandment of the Penta-sect.

212
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,980
Then he saved everyone.

213
00:12:00,830 --> 00:12:02,850
I guess more and more people

214
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:03,980
will think

215
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,490
Ding Yunqi is good.

216
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,220
Next,

217
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,920
everything is getting harder.

218
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,310
Tell the kids to pack up their things.

219
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,790
Let's go back to the headquarters first.

220
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,430
Yes, Master.

221
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,390
You ambushed the Black Feather Team and the mound-digging?

222
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:52,830
Yes.

223
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:53,960
I just played a trick.

224
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,990
You traveled around every day and enjoyed yourselves.

225
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,180
I led a group of men and went through the woods.

226
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:02,400
It wasted my time and energy.

227
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,510
How many people did you bring?

228
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,450
It's enough to protect you anyway.

229
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,300
Can they deal with Zhou Qiuhai?

230
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,870
I brought a machine gun.

231
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:15,840
I think it should be enough to deal with him.

232
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:19,660
Brother,

233
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,300
do you know who set a trap for you

234
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,310
in opium business?

235
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,550
Have you ever died, Fengling?

236
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:31,550
I have died.

237
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,580
Man.

238
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,850
Wake up.

239
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,570
Your hair is a mess.

240
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:06,070
Am I dead?

241
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,460
What are you looking at, coward?

242
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:21,820
Am I still alive?

243
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,670
Commander.

244
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,380
Commander, you didn't kill me.

245
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:41,600
Yes, I did.

246
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:42,990
But you're not dead.

247
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,710
Isn't it irritating?

248
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:53,110
Thank you, Commander Hu.

249
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,960
From now on, my life

250
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,090
is yours.

251
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:58,280
Why do I need your life?

252
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,800
I don't want it,

253
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,310
and I'll give it back to you.

254
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,330
What will you give me?

255
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,520
Foundation.

256
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:09,740
The foundation you want.

257
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,020
Father.

258
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,880
What did he call me?

259
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:23,770
Father.

260
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,870
From now on,

261
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,470
you are my father.

262
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,360
If a father is a hero, then his son will be a brave man.

263
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:31,160
You spare my life. You are a hero.

264
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,880
I want to be a brave man too.

265
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,420
Okay, son.

266
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,610
When Commander Hu took me to the execution ground,

267
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:42,170
I thought I would definitely die.

268
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
But I'm not dead.

269
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:46,370
But until today,

270
00:15:46,950 --> 00:15:48,930
I've been terrified.

271
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,250
What if I really had died then?

272
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:55,100
It's so nice to be alive.

273
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:57,790
I'm afraid of death now.

274
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,930
And I don't feel ashamed at all.

275
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,830
Being alive is important.

276
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,980
But when we're alive,

277
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,120
there are things we must do.

278
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:09,930
I don't think so.

279
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:13,920
If I have to do something,

280
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:15,430
I think, first,

281
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,520
I should be alive.

282
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:17,740
Second,

283
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:20,510
maybe I can marry Wu Shuang.

284
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,110
Third,

285
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,290
maybe I can marry Wu Shuang if I'm alive.

286
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:27,820
Don't you want to take revenge at all?

287
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,220
It doesn't matter.

288
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:33,950
Brother.

289
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,130
Tell me.

290
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,100
Wu Shuang

291
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,030
serves her old stubborn master

292
00:16:39,410 --> 00:16:40,880
as a god.

293
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,730
If I really

294
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,410
killed her master,

295
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:45,750
she would hate me forever.

296
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:48,270
Auntie Hei is dead, Brother.

297
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,280
I know.

298
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:50,080
So?

299
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,550
What can we do?

300
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,310
She can't come back to life.

301
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:54,950
Should we sacrifice

302
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,760
many people's lives because of her?

303
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:58,270
You...

304
00:16:58,520 --> 00:17:00,160
Why are you

305
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,670
so cold?

306
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:02,800
Am I cold?

307
00:17:03,730 --> 00:17:05,280
I'm much warmer

308
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,460
than this cold world.

309
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,940
I've been studying.

310
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,130
Studying...

311
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,530
A reader should have the dignity of a reader.

312
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,720
Fighting and killing is a disgrace to the dignity of a reader.

313
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,619
I've been reading a book called "A Happy Excursion".

314
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:22,420
It was written by Zhuangzi.

315
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:24,480
In the northern ocean there is a fish

316
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,030
called the k'un.

317
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:27,040
I don't know...

318
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,300
Luo Jiutian,

319
00:17:30,690 --> 00:17:32,920
I'm ordering you in the name of the special member.

320
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:35,100
Exterminate the mound-digging.

321
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,390
Why didn't you order me earlier?

322
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:41,130
Why didn't you order me earlier?

323
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,450
Why are you so hesitant?

324
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:44,170
Take actions immediately.

325
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,470
Yes.

326
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,040
But this...

327
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,630
The order Her Ladyship gave me

328
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:50,510
and the order you gave me

329
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,520
are contradictory.

330
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,450
She just asked me to protect you.

331
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,760
She didn't ask me to kill people for you.

332
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,950
Don't you care about our relationship?

333
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,130
I'm telling you this

334
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,940
because I care about our relationship.

335
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,730
Don't be blinded by hatred.

336
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:08,990
Fengling.

337
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:11,560
Let it go.

338
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,210
Whether it's about the Kunlun Mountains or Ding Yunqi,

339
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:17,860
they won't end well for you.

340
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,080
Listen to me.

341
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,370
You've changed.

342
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,310
Maybe.

343
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,620
I think you've changed.

344
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,230
Ms. Chu.

345
00:18:42,510 --> 00:18:43,730
If Her Ladyship asks me,

346
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:44,740
should I tell her we've met

347
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,870
or not?

348
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,800
Ms. Chu.

349
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,490
Her Ladyship asked me

350
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,970
to tell her

351
00:18:58,090 --> 00:18:59,480
our conversation.

352
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,510
In the northern ocean there is a fish

353
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,320
called the k'un.

354
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,630
I don't know

355
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,390
how many thousand li in size.

356
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:18,380
This k’un changes into a bird

357
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,360
called the p'eng.

358
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,630
Yunqi.

359
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,110
What's your next plan?

360
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,340
We need to gather soul pursuit orders first.

361
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,580
But Lao Beifeng and Uncle Shou Wujiang

362
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,790
are almost missing at the same time.

363
00:19:45,630 --> 00:19:46,680
It's difficult to investigate.

364
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:49,830
Let's rest here first.

365
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,300
Also,

366
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,780
I want to go to keep an appointment with the mound-digging first

367
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,840
to see if I can get the soul pursuit order from the mound-digging.

368
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:58,650
Brother,

369
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,250
think about it.

370
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:03,150
Is the person who impersonated me in Tianjin

371
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,490
Tian Long?

372
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:07,810
Maybe.

373
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:10,080
He must have many followers.

374
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:15,410
He'll definitely come to us.

375
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:16,670
By then,

376
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,140
let's take revenge

377
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,190
on him.

378
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,520
Fengling.

379
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,400
Yunqi.

380
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:29,990
I want to talk to you.

381
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,280
Okay.

382
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:36,120
Go ahead.

383
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,640
We should change the pact

384
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:40,650
we've made.

385
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:42,880
Of course.

386
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,230
I didn't know your identity at that time.

387
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,910
Now I know we're family.

388
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,830
Of course we should change it.

389
00:20:48,130 --> 00:20:49,850
I'm discussing the next move with Brother.

390
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,110
No.

391
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,130
I want half of your final say.

392
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,850
Five soul pursuit orders.

393
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,270
We both have one.

394
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,830
I can also report to Her Ladyship

395
00:21:02,950 --> 00:21:04,380
and ask her to send troops to besiege the Mound-digging Region.

396
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,980
Then I'll have

397
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:07,150
two soul pursuit orders.

398
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:08,830
With them,

399
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,970
I want half of your final say.

400
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:10,980
I didn't ask too much.

401
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:13,870
What did you say?

402
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,550
Besiege the Mound-digging Region?

403
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:16,440
Yes.

404
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:17,910
You can

405
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:18,960
tell your master now.

406
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,140
Aren't you here to inquire about information?

407
00:21:21,850 --> 00:21:22,860
Are you crazy?

408
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,310
Fengling, what are you talking about?

409
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,370
How is it, Yunqi?

410
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,890
Are you serious?

411
00:21:33,150 --> 00:21:33,910
What do you think?

412
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,300
So you're threatening me?

413
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,290
I'm not threatening you.

414
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,800
I'm just helping you analyze

415
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:42,900
the current situation.

416
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,050
I want to find the Kunlun Mountains

417
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:48,100
because I don't want to see more people die for it.

418
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,300
If you sacrifice hundreds of people's lives in the mound digging,

419
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,770
I'd rather not open the Kunlun Mountains.

420
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,810
If you want to besiege the mound-digging,

421
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,420
defeat me first.

422
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:00,830
What?

423
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,090
You want to kill me?

424
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:03,180
Come on.

425
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,900
You've killed one anyway.

426
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,200
Fengling.

427
00:22:09,350 --> 00:22:09,980
Brother.

428
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,540
Now you can see

429
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:13,180
who are family now.

430
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:15,400
People of the mound-digging can't die.

431
00:22:15,490 --> 00:22:16,620
My people can die.

432
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,350
Auntie Hei's death was an accident.

433
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,310
Fengling.

434
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:26,780
I understand how you feel.

435
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:28,720
Let's work hard together.

436
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,820
Don't make things worse, okay?

437
00:22:33,630 --> 00:22:35,600
If I didn't have this soul pursuit order,

438
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,580
would you still discuss this with me?

439
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:38,630
I respect you

440
00:22:38,670 --> 00:22:40,140
not because you have the soul pursuit order.

441
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,440
As for the soul pursuit order,

442
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,210
keep it.

443
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,670
Fengling.

444
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:51,690
The Penta-sect has been disbanded.

445
00:22:52,110 --> 00:22:53,410
We should return our soul pursuit order

446
00:22:53,790 --> 00:22:54,840
to Yunqi.

447
00:22:55,850 --> 00:22:56,520
Brother.

448
00:22:57,230 --> 00:22:58,910
When you gave it to me,

449
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:00,760
you said it was the amulet my father gave me.

450
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:02,060
What?

451
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,280
Are you going to give my amulet

452
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:04,670
to others?

453
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:06,470
It's okay.

454
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,860
Take it.

455
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,750
It's still your amulet.

456
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,430
It'll still protect you.

457
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,290
Also,

458
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,930
it's late today.

459
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,440
Go to bed early.

460
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,170
Okay.

461
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,310
Fengling.

462
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,960
I understand how you feel.

463
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,730
But you're going too far.

464
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,390
Brother.

465
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,070
Have you noticed?

466
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,840
We seem to have changed.

467
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:51,410
We've become the opposite of others' expectations.

468
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,310
When I was young, you taught me how to shoot.

469
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,750
I didn't like it. I was scared.

470
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,800
You forced me to practice.

471
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,280
You never yelled at me.

472
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:02,540
That was the first time.

473
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,600
We should become strong and cruel.

474
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,570
We should be cruller than the whole world.

475
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:12,580
Only in this way

476
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,970
can no one hurt us.

477
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:15,480
Brother,

478
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:17,700
that's what you taught me, right?

479
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,110
I'm doing what you said, right?

480
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,510
I was too childish.

481
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:26,100
I didn't understand what you said.

482
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,790
But after going through so much,

483
00:24:29,510 --> 00:24:30,300
I see.

484
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,820
You are right, so I'm doing what you said.

485
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,340
What?

486
00:24:35,090 --> 00:24:36,020
Am I wrong again?

487
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:43,490
Brother, I've grown up.

488
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,210
I'm not a kid anymore.

489
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,100
I don't need you to worry about me all the time.

490
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,700
I can protect myself.

491
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,420
I can even protect you.

492
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,020
I just don't want anyone

493
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,780
to disappear from my life again.

494
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:54,790
Am I wrong?

495
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,480
On the contrary,

496
00:24:58,480 --> 00:24:59,620
I think you've changed.

497
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,680
That masterful brother is gone.

498
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,990
You takes everything on the chin.

499
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,510
What are you afraid of?

500
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:09,320
What's wrong? What do you want?

501
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,050
Fengling.

502
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:15,160
I didn't take everything on the chin.

503
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,220
I used to think

504
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,030
Ding Yuanshan killed our parents and sister.

505
00:25:20,490 --> 00:25:22,210
So I made many mistakes.

506
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,200
That's how I got my revenge against the mound-digging.

507
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:27,300
And then?

508
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,560
Many calamities came one after another.

509
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,120
First, Jiutian.

510
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,220
Then Auntie Hei.

511
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,120
What are these?

512
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:40,440
Karma.

513
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:49,010
I've done too many wrong things.

514
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,620
I want to avoid making mistakes.

515
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,480
Fortunately, there's no bad feeling

516
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,700
between me and Yunqi.

517
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,700
He also helped us

518
00:25:57,830 --> 00:25:59,720
know who killed our father.

519
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,550
You asked me what I want.

520
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:10,300
I want vengeance.

521
00:26:11,690 --> 00:26:13,920
I also want to help Yunqi find the Kunlun Mountains.

522
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,600
Fengling.

523
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,170
I promise.

524
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,220
Before I finish these two things,

525
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,780
I won't let anyone

526
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,790
around us

527
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,520
leave us again.

528
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,290
Brother.

529
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,360
Does people really

530
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,300
really have to change

531
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,230
in their life

532
00:26:43,990 --> 00:26:44,910
all the time?

533
00:26:56,710 --> 00:26:57,260
Brother.

534
00:26:57,970 --> 00:26:58,640
Her Ladyship called.

535
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:04,990
Give it to Fengling.

536
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:11,080
Read it.

537
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,060
Read it.

538
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,150
Yes.

539
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:18,680
The special team has departed for over a month.

540
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,570
No valuable clues

541
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,910
have been reported to me.

542
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:25,020
I'm blaming Ms. Chu and Mr. Luo.

543
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,720
Work hard and live up to my expectations.

544
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,240
The Department of Internal Affairs of the National Government.

545
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:39,220
Call back.

546
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,270
We've been investigating for over a month.

547
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:44,090
The clues are either valueless or interlaced.

548
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,950
Moreover, many factions of the martial artists community appear in the dark.

549
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,510
There are many obstacles to the current mission.

550
00:27:52,150 --> 00:27:54,380
We're getting rid of these obstacles one by one.

551
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,480
We'll do our best not to let you down.

552
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,080
Yes.

553
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:39,530
What are you thinking?

554
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,520
Yunqi.

555
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,540
Tell me.

556
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,110
Why did Fengling become different?

557
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,740
She has been through a lot lately.

558
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:56,960
I understand.

559
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,780
But can a person change completely

560
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,540
after she has been through a lot?

561
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,630
She used to be a very gentle lady.

562
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,070
Look at her now.

563
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,000
She looks so arrogant.

564
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:17,370
And how can she bear to see so many people

565
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,580
die for her?

566
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:22,240
She's just being emotional.

567
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,540
Don't take it seriously.

568
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,840
Yunqi.

569
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:37,400
Will you change?

570
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:45,930
Of course not.

571
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,320
I know what you're worried about.

572
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,130
Don't worry.

573
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,190
I won't fight against your master.

574
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,840
I won't let the lives of people in the mound-digging

575
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,850
be sacrificed for this.

576
00:29:58,320 --> 00:29:59,280
Over the past few hundred years,

577
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:02,430
many people's lives have been sacrificed for the Kunlun Mountains.

578
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,360
There won't be such a day.

[Tomb of My Kind Father Shou Wujiang. Saluted by Your Son Yunsong and Your Daughter Fengling.]

580
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:50,020
Father.

581
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,910
Fengling and I didn't announce your death

582
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,510
according to the rules of the Penta-sect.

583
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,270
I think

584
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,920
you don't like that either.

585
00:31:07,570 --> 00:31:08,080
Father,

586
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,640
this place with good feng shui

587
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,540
was chosen by Sect Leader Zhou from the mound-digging.

588
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,060
You should be with the youngest sister

589
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,450
and mother now.

590
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:22,230
[Tomb of My Kind Father Shou Wujiang. Saluted by Your Son Yunsong and Your Daughter Fengling.]

591
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,620
Take good care of them.

592
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:26,930
Fengling

593
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:31,720
has me.

594
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:33,780
I'll take good care of her.

595
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,630
From now on,

596
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:42,890
I'll try my best to find Tian Long

597
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,410
and kill my enemy.

598
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,200
Yunqi.

Wu Shuang.

600
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,430
I'm sorry.

601
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,190
I was too impulsive yesterday.

602
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,210
Please don't take it to heart.

603
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,270
It's okay.

604
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
We can understand you.

605
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,420
I also made a mistake.

606
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:35,270
I said many harsh things.

607
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,030
Don't take it to heart.

608
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,170
OK.

609
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,850
I just hope

610
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,860
it won't hurt

611
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,250
our relationship.

612
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:44,670
No, it won't.

613
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,350
Just don't blame me.

614
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,840
We've been looking for the Kunlun Mountains all the way.

615
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:50,760
We don't know

616
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:52,110
how many unexpected things we'll encounter.

617
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,830
This is a challenge

618
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,050
for each of us.

619
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,280
If we can't trust each other,

620
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,180
I'm afraid this path will be harder.

621
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:03,910
Am I right, Yunqi?

622
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,480
I've discussed it with Brother.

623
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:09,120
Mourn for Uncle

624
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,880
for seven days here

625
00:33:11,340 --> 00:33:12,980
and then go to the headquarters of the mound-digging.

626
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,540
It's great

627
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,060
to have you.

628
00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:25,500
Let's go.

629
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:31,710
Yunqi.

630
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:34,440
Why do I feel so strange?

631
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,890
Her attitude towards me today is so strange.

632
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:41,920
Maybe she meant it.

633
00:33:43,090 --> 00:33:43,890
It's easy to tell.

634
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:45,400
If it's true,

635
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,130
she will definitely give you the soul pursuit order.

636
00:33:47,550 --> 00:33:48,300
If not,

637
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:50,190
think about it.

638
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:11,070
Yunqi.

639
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:14,130
This trip to the mound-digging...

640
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,050
Brother.

641
00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:20,389
Just say it.

642
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,380
I'll go out for a walk.

643
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,389
No need.

644
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:26,520
Stay here.

645
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:40,550
Judging from Zhou Quihai's stubborn personality,

646
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,190
he'll definitely

647
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,489
force you to be the Heaven Official again

648
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:45,460
and reunite with the Penta-sect.

649
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,980
He has the soul pursuit order we want,

650
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,170
but we have no bargaining chips.

651
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:52,020
Why not?

652
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,280
Yunqi just saved him

653
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,580
from Dragon Flight.

654
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:56,380
They all owe Yunqi a life.

655
00:34:57,430 --> 00:34:58,060
Brother San.

656
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,450
I didn't save people for this.

657
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,520
Yunqi.

658
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:04,910
I know.

659
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,170
In the martial artists community,

660
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,470
we shouldn't let people who we helped repay us.

661
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,110
But we have no bargaining chips.

662
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,950
Qin Qiong also sold his horse.

663
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:11,590
Yes.

664
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,390
But if we threaten him

665
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,570
with the grace of saving their lives,

666
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:16,670
what if Uncle Zhou really gives his life to us?

667
00:35:17,890 --> 00:35:19,190
The grudge between the two sides is deep enough.

668
00:35:20,050 --> 00:35:20,910
I won't do

669
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:21,960
such a terrible thing.

670
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,180
Don't mention it again.

671
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,560
I don't believe

672
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:26,120
Zhou Quihai doesn't want his

673
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,500
and his disciples' lives.

674
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,220
San.

675
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,610
Listen to Yunqi.

676
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:34,310
I think

677
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:35,950
Zhou Quihai

678
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,120
understands my attitude.

679
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,840
Since we made an appointment,

680
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,570
there's room for negotiation.

681
00:35:40,990 --> 00:35:41,950
We'll know when we try.

682
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:58,580
Fengling.

683
00:35:58,710 --> 00:35:59,510
Why are you here?

684
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:01,730
I have no appetite this morning.

685
00:36:06,190 --> 00:36:06,900
Wu Shuang.

686
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,440
Do you want to go back to the mound-digging?

687
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:11,270
Of course.

688
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,790
The mound-digging is my home.

689
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:13,830
I grew up there.

690
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:17,530
Can you tell me about the mound-digging?

691
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:22,190
The mountains, water and people in the mound-digging are nice.

692
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:23,450
When they're walking on the streets,

693
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,550
everyone is happy.

694
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,980
I'm afraid

695
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,410
they won't be so happy when we go there.

696
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,200
If your master and Yunqi...

697
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,140
It's just an assumption.

698
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,110
My master won't hurt Yunqi.

699
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,460
That's not what I meant.

700
00:36:47,430 --> 00:36:48,560
I'm just thinking

701
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:50,240
when we arrive at the mound-digging,

702
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,850
if your master let you choose

703
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,160
between the mound-digging and Ding Yunqi,

704
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,880
which one would you choose?

705
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,730
-Xuewen. -Wu Shuang.

706
00:37:52,070 --> 00:37:52,910
Why are you here?

707
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,840
Master asked me to wait for you here.

708
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,560
And I've found a place for you to stay.

709
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:58,110
Come with me.

710
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:00,510
I'll go with you.

711
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:01,220
Let's go.

712
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:01,890
Get in.

713
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:02,610
Go.

714
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:07,140
Here.

715
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,390
Xuewen, you're back.

716
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:39,350
You're back.

717
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:42,380
Xuewen.

718
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:43,980
How is Master?

719
00:38:44,610 --> 00:38:46,500
He's receiving treatment and taking medicine.

720
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,050
Don't worry.

721
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:48,720
You're back.

722
00:38:48,850 --> 00:38:49,620
Yao.

723
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,070
What did the doctor say?

724
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:52,250
He's fine.

725
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,340
I'm leaving.

726
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:54,690
Listen.

727
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:55,820
You just came back.

728
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:57,160
Don't worry about Master.

729
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,550
We seniors are here.

730
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:00,100
Don't forget

731
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,950
our mound-digging runs private banks.

732
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,380
All good doctors can be invited.

733
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:11,650
Fu.

734
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:12,540
Xuewen.

735
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,220
Alright, sir, stop.

736
00:39:15,270 --> 00:39:16,110
Stop, stop, stop.

737
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,660
We've arrived. Come on.

738
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:18,540
We've arrived.

739
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,070
Let's go.

740
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,950
This yard is our mound-digging's private house.

741
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,210
The location is very good.

742
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:57,640
There are front yard and backyard.

743
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:58,860
It has two doors.

744
00:39:59,030 --> 00:39:59,910
Everyone,

745
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,250
find your rooms.

746
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:04,450
Thank you.

747
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,410
You're welcome, Mr. Ding.

748
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,050
You're our guest.

749
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,270
This is what I should do.

750
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:13,100
How is Uncle Zhou?

751
00:40:13,270 --> 00:40:14,860
Thank you for your concern. Master is fine.

752
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:16,500
And Master has specially mentioned

753
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:17,530
we can keep an appointment

754
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,350
as usual tomorrow.

755
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,990
I'll go there.

756
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,850
Let go of me!

757
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,690
You...

758
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:27,550
You...

759
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:28,550
Let go of me!

760
00:40:28,550 --> 00:40:29,230
Bro.

761
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,120
-Why are you so fierce? -Bro.

762
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:31,830
Let go!

763
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:33,590
There's a man who I don't know in the kitchen.

764
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:35,530
This is Chen.

765
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:36,790
He's not from the mound-digging.

766
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,310
You need someone

767
00:40:40,610 --> 00:40:41,830
to look after you here.

768
00:40:41,990 --> 00:40:43,420
This is the servant I found for you.

769
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,270
Really?

770
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,960
I think I can cook alone.

771
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,630
I don't need anyone else.

772
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,220
Young man.

773
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,760
Besides...

774
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:52,620
Your worries

775
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,490
look down on our mound-digging.

776
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,020
I...

777
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,540
Our mound-digging doesn't need it.

778
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,470
We won't send anyone to spy on you.

779
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:01,940
Because most people who live in this town

780
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,580
are ordinary people.

781
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,920
They are unsophisticated.

782
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,190
They've been favored by the mound-digging for generations.

783
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:09,290
If the mound-digging is in danger,

784
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,640
even without my arrangements,

785
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:12,650
they'll risk their lives to protect us.

786
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:15,840
That's right.

787
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,400
That's right.

788
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:19,290
Mr. Ding.

789
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,800
I've completed my task.

790
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,060
I won't bother you then.

791
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:25,080
Wu Shuang,

792
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:26,600
come back with me to see Master.

793
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,570
Let's go.

794
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,290
Goodbye.

795
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,020
Sorry, sir.

796
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,080
It's okay. I'm leaving.

797
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:35,960
Yunqi,

798
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:37,600
I think we should be cautious.

799
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:38,990
This is the mound-digging's territory after all.

800
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,340
We'd better check it out.

801
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,030
We just need to be more careful in the future.
