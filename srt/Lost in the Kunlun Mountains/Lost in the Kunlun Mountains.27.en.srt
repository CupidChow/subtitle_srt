[Episode 27]

4
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,090
Take the soul pursuit order

5
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,350
and leave.

6
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:32,250
Yutian.

7
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:35,820
Do you think Ding Yunqi

8
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:39,010
will choose

9
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,270
Wu Shuang

10
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,960
or the soul pursuit order?

11
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,120
Master,

12
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:48,460
I don't know.

13
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,440
I don't know, either.

14
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,370
We'll know when we check it out.

15
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:15,680
Yes, Master.

16
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:30,079
Leave.

17
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,380
I'll choose on my own.

18
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,160
I choose you.

19
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,370
Yunqi.

20
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,420
♫Don't cry♫

21
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,570
♫We promised we'll be happy♫

♫Wind and rain are actually gifts♫

37
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,659
Uncle.

38
00:06:51,090 --> 00:06:51,970
Uncle.

39
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,360
I admit defeat.

40
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,690
Then go with them.

41
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:00,790
Let's go.

42
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,770
Don't you want to leave?

43
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,280
It's all in vain.

44
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,090
What a pity.

45
00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:33,610
Not at all.

46
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,669
I can only choose between the soul pursuit order and Wu Shuang.

47
00:08:36,929 --> 00:08:38,309
This is a dead end.

48
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,210
If you give up Wu Shuang,

49
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:42,890
it will not be a dead end anymore.

50
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:47,050
That's why I said

51
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:51,460
we still have to obey the rules of the Penta-sect.

52
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,610
It's just love.

53
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:57,590
You are not qualified as a hero.

54
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,900
Concerning weighing the pros and cons and plotting,

55
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,080
I'm not as good as you, uncle.

56
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,050
But I have a question.

57
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,020
Go ahead.

58
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,750
All the traps in the tomb

59
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,900
are as if tailor-made for the Ding family.

60
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,790
The Nine-grid Gate and willow catkins

61
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,890
are both the secrets of the Ding family.

62
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:20,650
What secret of the Ding Family?

63
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,500
That's the secret of the Penta-sect.

64
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:27,200
Only the Ding family can solve it.

65
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:29,590
So,

66
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,230
we've been waiting for the Ding Family

67
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:32,740
to solve the secret of this underground palace

68
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,420
for generations.

69
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,160
It's a copy of the Kunlun Mountains?

70
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:40,640
Yes.

71
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,290
Why is there

72
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:44,670
a copy of the Kunlun Mountains in Mound-digging?

73
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,340
It has to be explained from a long time ago.

74
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,240
A sect leader of Mound-digging

75
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,130
accidentally found

76
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,740
some of the building blueprints of the Kunlun Mountains,

77
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:00,630
so he started to build a copy of it.

78
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,770
After many generations,

79
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,040
until my generation,

80
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,390
it can be considered as being finished.

81
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:09,950
Besides,

82
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,780
what's wrong with my Mound-digging building a copy of the Kunlun Mountains?

83
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:20,870
Why is the secret of Kunlun Mountains

84
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,430
only known by Heaven Officials?

85
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:26,040
Why is the Heaven Official the leader of the Penta-sect?

86
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,170
Look.

87
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:37,210
Look.

88
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,400
Even you Heaven Officials can't answer it.

89
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,800
You want the Kunlun Mountains?

90
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:44,180
No.

91
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,710
I want to protect it.

92
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,690
The Kunlun Mountains belong to the Penta-sect,

93
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,420
not your Heaven Officials.

94
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:57,460
From now on,

95
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,020
this rule should be changed.

96
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,350
I know everything about you

97
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,700
when you were in the underground palace.

98
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,300
What do you want to do?

99
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:11,360
What else can I do?

100
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,210
To protect the Kunlun Mountains, of course.

101
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,150
It is the treasure of the Penta-sect.

102
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,670
It should be owned exclusively by the Penta-sect.

103
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:21,350
You can't use it to help outsiders casually.

104
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:25,180
This is the order of the ancestors of the Penta-sect.

105
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:29,790
No, they are all wrong.

106
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,820
This is a world of survival of the fittest.

107
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,300
The weak will naturally be eliminated.

108
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,980
You don't need to help them.

109
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:41,810
The Penta-sect, with this wealth,

110
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:43,780
will become powerful naturally.

111
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,770
It seems that my father and I

112
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:54,200
have misjudged you.

113
00:11:56,510 --> 00:11:57,470
It doesn't matter

114
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:58,770
whether you misjudge me or not.

115
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:00,790
Anyway, he has passed away.

116
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:02,510
As for you,

117
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:04,530
after you go up to the Mound-digging Region,

118
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,670
I guess

119
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:10,240
you'll never get down.

120
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,100
I don't believe I can't.

121
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:16,790
Okay.

122
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,820
Then you can try.

123
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,240
Brother.

124
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,750
Isn't this too long?

125
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,600
What do you mean?

126
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:35,860
You want to rush in with your men?

127
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:38,000
Brother, you think so, too?

128
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,660
What are we waiting for? Take our men and go.

129
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,010
Are you familiar with the Mound-digging Headquarters?

130
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:47,790
Do you know how many men there are?

131
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:49,470
Do you know

132
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,520
how the traps are set?

133
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:51,860
No.

134
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,160
Then how should we go?

135
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,780
But we can't just wait.

136
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,050
Stop!

137
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,440
Don't move!

138
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,740
I'll shoot if you move.

139
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,460
Don't move!

140
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:20,970
Who are you?

141
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:23,820
I'm here to send you a message.

142
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,210
How rude!

143
00:13:34,490 --> 00:13:35,710
Wu Shuang asked me to come.

144
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,390
Thank you.

145
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,320
What's the situation of Wu Shuang and Yunqi now?

146
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,540
I only know that...

147
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,510
Ding Yunqi and Master made a bet to break into the underground palace.

148
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:43,860
If he wins,

149
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,660
Master will give him the soul pursuit order.

150
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:47,050
If he loses,

151
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,810
Master will lock him up in the Mound-digging Region

152
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:50,200
and never let him down.

153
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:51,630
Did Yunqi win or lose?

154
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,260
Of course he lost.

155
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,290
What did Wu Shuang say?

156
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,510
Nothing.

157
00:13:58,510 --> 00:13:59,730
She just asked me to tell you this.

158
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,370
He's already entered the Mound-digging Region.

159
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:02,290
What else can she say?

160
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:03,930
That's the Mound-digging Region.

161
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:04,980
All right.

162
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,620
I've sent you the message. I'm leaving.

163
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,420
Thank you.

164
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,030
Brother, what is the Mound-digging Region?

165
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:25,140
It's the prison of Mound-digging.

166
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,120
But I don't know the exact location.

167
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:29,300
I only heard that in the Qing Dynasty,

168
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,480
someone of the Mound-digging caught a corrupt official and locked him up there.

169
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,740
In the end, the son of the corrupt official

170
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,920
brought an army of a battalion

171
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,390
but failed to rescue his father.

172
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,080
The Qing soldiers were still soldiers.

173
00:14:38,790 --> 00:14:39,840
But it shows that

174
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:42,280
the Mound-digging Region is a hard one.

175
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,910
No matter how hard it is,

176
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:45,340
I don't believe they can be tougher than us.

177
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:47,020
That's right.

178
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:48,580
No matter how hard it is, we have to fight it.

179
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,090
We must rescue Yunqi.

180
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,850
Turn left.

181
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,190
Up.

182
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,110
Okay. Stay still. Turn right.

183
00:15:29,110 --> 00:15:29,900
Up.

184
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:32,510
It's flat.

185
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,560
Turn left. Up.

186
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,320
Just tolerate for a while.

187
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:51,870
When you get up there,

188
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,840
I'll take off your handcuffs, shackles

189
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,310
and eye mask.

190
00:15:55,570 --> 00:15:56,280
Thank you.

191
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,130
Rise.

192
00:19:13,630 --> 00:19:14,980
From now on, three meals a day

193
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,240
will be delivered to you by our men

194
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,250
on the balcony.

195
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,600
I'll send you pen and paper

196
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:21,660
at dinner tonight.

197
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,340
As long as you need something in the future,

198
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,730
and I'm capable of getting it,

199
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,070
I will send it to you.

200
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,890
What else do you want?

201
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,330
Thank you, Senior Jiang.

202
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,520
Yunqi.

203
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,050
You want to break the rules and disband the Penta-sect.

204
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,740
But you can't force it.

205
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:50,130
I was reckless this time.

206
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,890
Senior Jiang,

207
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,870
take care of Wu Shuang for me.

208
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,460
Tell her not to worry too much about me.

209
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,770
Tell her

210
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,740
I will find a way to leave.

211
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,190
Don't worry about Wu Shuang.

212
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,960
I will take care of her for you.

213
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,100
But as for leaving...

214
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,450
Why must Master send Ding Yunqi

215
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:42,710
to the Mound-digging Region?

216
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,690
Whether Ding Yunqi is here or not,

217
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,200
the Penta-sect has been disbanded.

218
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,980
Other sects

219
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:51,410
can make their own sect.

220
00:20:51,410 --> 00:20:53,000
Why can't we?

221
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:57,290
Maybe Master thinks differently from us.

222
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,020
Wu Shuang.

223
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,280
You...

224
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:03,960
Don't you blame Master?

225
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,080
Sanmei, come with me.

226
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,510
What's wrong, Senior?

227
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,690
I know

228
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,200
you went to inform Luo Yunsong just now.

229
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,130
I'll take you to apologize to Master.

230
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,370
Master knew it?

231
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:24,880
I knew it.

232
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,160
Xingchen.

233
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,400
You want me to accept the punishment?

234
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,580
I asked her to go.

235
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:47,310
If anyone needs to accept punishment, I'll go.

236
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,760
Master.

237
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,610
Ding Yunqi was quiet all the way.

238
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,170
He didn't do anything extreme.

239
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:25,400
Okay.

240
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:28,930
Master,

241
00:22:29,430 --> 00:22:30,360
I think

242
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,420
we can lock him up in the Mound-digging Region for a while,

243
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,430
and maybe he can think it through himself.

244
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:35,650
By then,

245
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:37,920
we can let him go.

246
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,290
Don't mention

247
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,470
letting him go from now on.

248
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:48,000
He's stubborn, too.

249
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,420
Let's see how long he can hang in there.

250
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,300
Treat him nicely in clothing and food.

251
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,030
Master, but...

252
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,290
I know you care about Wu Shuang

253
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,520
and you think Ding Yunqi is a talent.

254
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:04,540
Don't I care about Wu Shuang?

255
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:09,580
But he is so much like his father.

256
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,780
For Mound-digging and the Penta-sect,

257
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,290
I have to do this.

258
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:17,060
Yes.

259
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,260
Master.

260
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,600
I'm here to apologize.

261
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:23,820
I asked Hong Sanmei

262
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,050
to inform Luo Yunsong and the others.

263
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,240
Master.

264
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,040
Master, don't be angry.

265
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:38,730
You know the Mound-digging Region well.

266
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:41,040
Even if Luo Yunsong and the others send an army here,

267
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,180
it's impossible to get Ding Yunqi and the rest

268
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:42,930
down.

269
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,370
I think, after Wu Shuang informed them,

270
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,720
maybe Luo Yunsong and the others

271
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,690
would give up since it's hard.

272
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:51,000
We don't have to fight anymore.

273
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,100
It's also a good thing.

274
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,660
Wu Shuang.

275
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,210
Master is no longer angry.

276
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,430
Leave now.

277
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,440
Go.

278
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,530
I know how you feel.

279
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,560
Go back.

280
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,360
Go back.

281
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:19,050
Go back.

282
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,140
Anything else?

283
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,250
Master.

284
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,230
Forgive me for being unfilial.

285
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,660
I can't serve you anymore.

286
00:24:44,210 --> 00:24:46,010
I can't be filial to you anymore.

287
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:52,400
What do you mean?

288
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,010
I'm here to ask you for my marriage.

289
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,350
Marriage?

290
00:25:15,410 --> 00:25:16,250
Yes.

291
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,850
I want to marry Ding Yunqi.

292
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,740
I swear

293
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,340
after marrying Ding Yunqi,

294
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:24,230
I will never step out of the Mound-digging Region in my life.

295
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,650
Wu Shuang, what are you thinking?

296
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,090
Don't you know

297
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:33,350
what the Mound-digging Region is?

298
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,990
It's not a place for humans.

299
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:37,670
That's why I have to accompany him.

300
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,290
Yunqi was locked up

301
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,510
because he gave up the soul pursuit order for me.

302
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,740
He chose it himself.

303
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,670
He chose it himself. It has nothing to do with you.

304
00:25:47,670 --> 00:25:48,680
You can't go.

305
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,490
Wu Shuang, don't you know?

306
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,720
As long as you are here,

307
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,480
will master treat him badly?

308
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,720
Thank you, Xuewen.

309
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,200
I still want to go.

310
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:07,790
Kid,

311
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:10,890
why do you do this to yourself? Why?

312
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:20,220
I've made up my mind.

313
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,900
Please allow me.

314
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:29,250
I've made up my mind.

315
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:30,720
Please allow me.

316
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:39,240
Go. Go. Go.

317
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,550
Go.

318
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,070
It's like I've raised you for nothing.

319
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,410
If you want to marry him, just go.

320
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,510
Leave.

321
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,040
Thank you, Master.

322
00:26:57,350 --> 00:26:58,440
If there is a next life,

323
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:02,050
I'm willing to do anything to repay you.

324
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:56,480
You two may leave.

325
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,010
-Yes. -Yes.

326
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,550
Xuewen.

327
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,170
Master.

328
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,660
We Mound-digging

329
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,030
never had a wedding, right?

330
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,580
Help her.

331
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:29,370
Make her decent.

332
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,160
Yes, Master.

333
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:19,850
San.

334
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,250
Can you calm down?

335
00:29:28,790 --> 00:29:31,020
Brother, am I being impulsive?

336
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,570
You don't allow me to do anything.

337
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,540
You just don't save Yunqi.

338
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,100
I think it's not that complicated.

339
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,320
I'll take some brothers of Gold Touching

340
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,160
to Mound-digging Headquarters

341
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,290
and catch some people of them.

342
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:40,850
I don't believe

343
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,400
that old man Zhou won't let him go.

344
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:44,800
That's the Mound-digging Headquarters.

345
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,110
Do you know how many traps there are?

346
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,500
Have you ever thought about

347
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,810
what Zhou Qiuhai will do to Yunqi if we just attack their headquarters?

348
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,240
I don't understand what you're saying.

349
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:55,420
Anyway, even if we're doomed,

350
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:56,640
I have to save Yunqi.

351
00:29:58,780 --> 00:29:59,750
That makes sense.

352
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,310
Brother, you changed your mind?

353
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:03,280
Let's go then.

354
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:07,060
I haven't changed my mind.

355
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:08,690
But you inspired me.

356
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,640
I want to kidnap Zhou Qiuhai

357
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,200
at the Mound-digging Headquarters.

358
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,130
This is good.

359
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,400
Brother,

360
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,750
don't you think you are being fanciful?

361
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,390
You think it's impossible.

362
00:30:22,510 --> 00:30:23,650
Zhou Qiuhai and Mound-digging people

363
00:30:23,650 --> 00:30:24,700
also think it's impossible.

364
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,710
If they are careless,

365
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:27,930
our chance

366
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,020
will come.

367
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,830
Brother, although what you said

368
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:32,800
sounds like a fantasy,

369
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:33,850
like you're still in a dream,

370
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,400
I like it.

371
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:36,750
Let's do it.

372
00:31:57,930 --> 00:31:58,770
Anybody here?

373
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,970
I'm Ding Yunqi.

374
00:32:03,650 --> 00:32:04,950
May I ask who you are?

375
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,640
Brother.

376
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,480
Mr. Luo.

377
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,190
You are here.

378
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:59,170
I'll make it short.

379
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:00,890
I want you to figure out

380
00:33:00,890 --> 00:33:02,910
the defense deployment of Mound-digging Headquarters.

381
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,250
And Zhou Qiuhai's

382
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,470
activities every day.

383
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,320
Simply putting it,

384
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,500
where Zhou Qiuhai goes every day,

385
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,510
who he meets,

386
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,640
and what he does every day.

387
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:12,480
Brother.

388
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,740
What are we up to?

389
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:16,260
Kidnapping Zhou Qiuhai.

390
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,690
Kidnapping Zhou Qiuhai?

391
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:18,740
Cut the crap.

392
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,250
There's nothing we can do else.

393
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:22,180
Yes.

394
00:33:22,810 --> 00:33:24,450
It is a bit risky.

395
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:26,220
But considering the current situation,

396
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,430
we can only take the risk.

397
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:29,200
I'll listen to you.

398
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,260
We are strangers in Mound-digging.

399
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,140
So it's difficult

400
00:33:32,140 --> 00:33:33,440
to get information.

401
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,660
I've observed.

402
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,460
Although there aren't many people in this town,

403
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,350
many people come here and do business.

404
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,290
We can dress some people up as merchants

405
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,420
and have them walk around the streets.

406
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,800
It's not easy to be discovered.

407
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,410
And women don't make people alert easily.

408
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:48,180
Many people in Mound-digging know us.

409
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,690
We should try not to show up.

410
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,740
If we have to show up,

411
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,040
we must dress up.

412
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,030
I'd rather not get the information

413
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:56,580
than expose ourselves.

414
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:58,810
Brother.

415
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:00,490
Brother.

416
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:02,290
Something happened.

417
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,430
What's wrong? Why are you so flustered?

418
00:34:03,430 --> 00:34:04,350
What happened?

419
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,320
Wu Shuang.

420
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:06,700
She's going to the Mound-digging Region

421
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,090
to marry Young Master.

422
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,150
Wu Shuang is going to Mound-digging Region?

423
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,040
Wu Shuang is marrying Ding Yunqi?

424
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:14,010
Yes.

425
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,239
The whole town knew it.

426
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,290
I heard that

427
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:18,840
to prepare dowry for Wu Shuang,

428
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:20,650
that Jiang Xuewen

429
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:22,540
went around to all the shops in town.

430
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,639
Fengling.

431
00:34:47,270 --> 00:34:48,239
Are you looking for me?

432
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,630
Brother,

433
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:52,310
you said what you want to do most now

434
00:34:52,310 --> 00:34:53,780
is to marry Wu Shuang alive, right?

435
00:34:54,710 --> 00:34:55,590
I'm a cripple.

436
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:57,350
I went all the way here.

437
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,870
And you are telling me this?

438
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,010
Wu Shuang is getting married.

439
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,060
With whom?

440
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:08,780
Ding Yunqi.

441
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:12,180
Isn't Ding Yunqi going to

442
00:35:12,470 --> 00:35:13,310
the Mound-digging Region?

443
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:15,160
Yes, she wants to marry Ding Yunqi

444
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,290
in the Mound-digging Region

445
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:18,140
and stay with him there forever.

446
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,120
Is she crazy?

447
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,010
Isn't she jumping into the fire pit?

448
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:28,140
Are you kidding me?

449
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,560
Brother,

450
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:36,330
you're the only one who can stop her now.

451
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,370
Yours are red candles with the character Xi (happiness),

452
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,420
and the eight-fruit combo.

453
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,390
Yours are

454
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,200
the dragon-phoenix bed tent and red bedding.

455
00:36:12,990 --> 00:36:14,170
When you put them up,

456
00:36:14,170 --> 00:36:15,350
don't make a mistake.

457
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,740
Let us Mound-digging have some good luck.

458
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:19,970
Wu Shuang will be happier when she sees it.

459
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,200
You are so beautiful.

460
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:31,600
But

461
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,410
I don't know if I should congratulate you

462
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:37,450
or try to

463
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:39,120
persuade you not to go like the seniors.

464
00:36:40,870 --> 00:36:41,510
Wu Shuang.

465
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,650
Are you sure Ding Yunqi

466
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:45,290
loves you as much as you love him?

467
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:46,550
Of course.

468
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,740
Sanmei.

469
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,960
I'm really happy.

470
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,820
I know the Mound-digging Region is deserted.

471
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,430
And life may be hard there.

472
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,110
But do you know?

473
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,960
For me,

474
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,380
the Mound-digging Region

475
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:04,570
is my paradise.

476
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,090
Send me some seeds and soil of flowers later.

477
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:08,890
Maybe in a few years,

478
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,120
the Mound-digging Region will be covered with flowers.

479
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,520
Wu Shuang.

480
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,920
I'm very happy for you.

481
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:18,720
I also admire you

482
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,120
and I think I will miss you even more.

483
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,260
Alright, today is your big day.

484
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:30,400
Let's talk about happy things.

485
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:32,880
You can't just bloom.

486
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,350
You need to have results, too.

487
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,700
Stop talking nonsense.

488
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,170
Just give birth to a few children.

489
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,970
The Mound-digging Region will be lively.

490
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,700
This is the most serious.

491
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:50,600
Luo Jiutian?

492
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:52,950
How did you get in?

493
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,560
Luo Jiutian?

494
00:37:56,730 --> 00:37:57,870
-Come here! -Sanmei.

495
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:02,740
Master Luo came back to life and came here.

496
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:05,510
I bet you want to tell me something important.

497
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,650
You may leave.

498
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,710
Don't tell anyone. It's okay.

499
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:19,540
It's almost time for me to get married.

500
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:21,470
Just say it.

501
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,270
Luo Jiutian,

502
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,750
are you snatching again?

503
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,440
Listen, this is the Mound-digging.

504
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:51,250
I don't care how you got in.

505
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:53,050
If you dare to touch me again,

506
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,400
you won't get out of here.

507
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,290
And I asked you to stay

508
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,390
to make it clear to you.

509
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,320
I hope you won't pester me anymore.

510
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,550
I'm not here to pester you.

511
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,060
I'm not dead.

512
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,460
But I want to tell you

513
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,980
I feel like

514
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,370
dead.

515
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,220
I...

516
00:39:21,070 --> 00:39:22,240
Because I can't see you.

517
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,060
I miss you every day.

518
00:39:26,990 --> 00:39:28,210
You were also in my dreams.

519
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,100
It's okay if you don't want to marry me.

520
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:33,830
But I don't want

521
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,200
you to ruin the rest of your life

522
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:39,800
for Ding Yunqi.

523
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:41,520
I do.

524
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,770
What am I to you?

525
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,330
An ugly

526
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,640
bully,

527
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,040
and a bad guy.

528
00:39:56,770 --> 00:39:57,690
I admit that

529
00:39:57,690 --> 00:39:59,620
I'm a toad who wants to eat swan meat.

530
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,880
Okay?

531
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:02,690
But I mean it.

532
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,370
I...

533
00:40:06,170 --> 00:40:07,430
I sincerely hope

534
00:40:08,570 --> 00:40:10,080
you can live well.

535
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,010
I'm going to get married,

536
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:18,730
not to die.

537
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,080
I will live well.

538
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:24,650
You are going to the Mound-digging Region and you say you will live well?

539
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,250
Is the Mound-digging Region

540
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,550
a good place to live?

541
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:29,820
It's a rat cave that even ghosts don't even go.

542
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:30,700
Do you know?

543
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:37,710
That's not a place for humans,

544
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,610
nor a place for you.

545
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:45,820
I know.

546
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,090
I know you don't love me.

547
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:50,440
If you don't like me,

548
00:40:51,530 --> 00:40:52,540
I'll stay away from you.

549
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,180
I'll look at you from afar.

550
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,620
But I don't want to see you suffer.

551
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,100
I don't want to see you lead a bad life, either.

552
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:09,340
I don't know what kind of life

553
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,190
I will lead in the Mound-digging Region.

554
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:14,840
But even if it's a lifetime,

555
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,060
a year,

556
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:19,210
a month or a day,

557
00:41:20,430 --> 00:41:21,730
I have to go.

558
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,220
You can't stop me.

559
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,780
Unless I die in your hands today.

560
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,070
I love you.

561
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:41,930
I told you

562
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,540
I can die for you.

563
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,670
Can I stop you with my life?

564
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:55,500
Are you crazy?

565
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:57,010
I'm not.

566
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,280
Promise me.

567
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,470
As long as you don't go,

568
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,400
I swear, okay?

569
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,380
I swear I'll do everything I can

570
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:09,150
to get Ding Yunqi down for you.

571
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,000
Isn't it good for you two to get married down here?

572
00:42:16,370 --> 00:42:17,340
I can't promise you.

573
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,240
Fine.

574
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,640
You've made up your mind.

575
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,890
But if you go up there,

576
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,580
I'll never see you again.

577
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,910
My life will be meaningless.

578
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,440
Let me become a ray of smoke

579
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:42,200
and accompany you up there.

580
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,000
Didn't you say you love me

581
00:42:49,260 --> 00:42:50,520
and can die for me?

582
00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:52,660
Then you should know

583
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,130
I love Ding Yunqi.

584
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,610
If I don't marry him,

585
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:00,720
every day in this world

586
00:43:03,070 --> 00:43:04,590
I'm like a walking dead.

587
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:07,820
You can't stop me.

588
00:43:08,870 --> 00:43:10,000
If you stop me now,

589
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,100
it equals to making me die once every day.

590
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,240
Tell me.

591
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,300
Do you want to see me

592
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:17,560
die once every day?

593
00:43:18,820 --> 00:43:19,700
Tell me.

594
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,380
I don't want to.

595
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,410
Every day without you,

596
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:28,150
I die once every day.

597
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,200
It's time.

598
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,220
Help me put on the Phoenix Coronet

599
00:44:20,650 --> 00:44:21,950
and send me off.
