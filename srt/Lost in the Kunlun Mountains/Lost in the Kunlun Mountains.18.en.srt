[Episode 18]

4
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,980
So this is the Heaven Official's Soul Pursuit Order.

5
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,540
So beautiful!

6
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,410
To open the Kunlun Mountains,

7
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:13,100
we need to gather the Soul Pursuit Order from all factions of Penta-sect.

8
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,630
Okay, go ahead.

9
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:19,820
Unfortunately,

10
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,790
I don't have the Soul Pursuit Order of Mound-digging Sect.

11
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:23,090
I can't help you.

12
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,960
I should go back to Master.

13
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,480
Aren't you going with me?

14
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:32,290
No.

15
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,020
Why?

16
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,760
It's your mission to find the Kunlun Mountains,

17
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:40,060
not mine.

18
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,750
Here's the dragon bone.

19
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:51,820
To open the Kunlun Mountains,

20
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:52,950
of course we should go together.

21
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:56,140
I'm not interested in the Kunlun Mountains.

22
00:02:56,650 --> 00:02:57,400
I don't care.

23
00:02:57,610 --> 00:02:59,000
You must go with me.

24
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,170
Although you're not the Heaven Official,

25
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:07,230
you're a member of the Ding family.

26
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:09,370
It's natural for you to find the Kunlun Mountains.

27
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,310
But me? Who am I?

28
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:12,100
Why should I follow you

29
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,410
to find the Kunlun Mountains together?

30
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,590
Besides,

31
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,270
I'm still a disciple of Mound-digging Sect.

32
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:19,290
I risked being punished by Master

33
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,590
while messing around with you for days.

34
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,890
I should go back.

35
00:03:22,690 --> 00:03:24,490
Mound-digging Sect is my home.

36
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,170
Didn't you always say

37
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:27,900
we should spend more time with our family.

38
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,520
Are you still mad at me?

39
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,200
No.

40
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,610
You are angry.

41
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,290
If holding the dragon bone can relieve your anger,

42
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,180
keep it. Come on.

43
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,220
It has nothing to do with the dragon bone.

44
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:52,990
Usually, you will stop being angry soon.

45
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:54,270
Why does it take so long this time?

46
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,690
I'm not angry.

47
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,580
I just gave up.

48
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,880
Give up on what?

49
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,380
Your giving up being the Heaven Official

50
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,060
is actually giving up on me.

51
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,940
Why do you have to relate being the Heaven Official

52
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,320
to getting married?

53
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,130
Then why don't you

54
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:30,360
do so?

55
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:40,220
Yunqi.

56
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:42,150
Uncle Ding has left.

57
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,490
Just like him,

58
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:45,050
I want you to be happy.

59
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,980
Now that I see you have your own mission,

60
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,580
I'm very happy for you.

61
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,550
Just do what you should do.

62
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,020
I don't want to put you in a dilemma.

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,650
What about you?

64
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,340
I...

65
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,490
I want to find my own happiness.

66
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,470
We're sworn friends.

67
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,610
But I have my own life.

68
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,510
You're still blaming me.

69
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:20,910
I don't blame you.

70
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:22,800
I accept it.

71
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:24,990
Don't worry.

72
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,130
I won't talk about marriage anymore.

73
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,470
You too, don't mention it.

74
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,400
Am I going to lose you?

75
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:39,560
Who said that?

76
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,530
If someone bullies you,

77
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:41,830
I'll beat them up for you.

78
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:57,659
Let's go.

79
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:58,730
Go back.

80
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:03,670
You start your new life tomorrow.

81
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,010
I'll start mine.

82
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,790
Wu Shuang.

83
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:19,630
What's wrong?

84
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,610
Let's go.

85
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,220
To the tree ahead,

86
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:32,820

you have something on your mind?

Master.

Ding Yuanshan

147

is back.

00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,010
Where is he?

149
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,490
He's dead.

150
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:54,760
What happened?

151
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,950
I don't know the details.

152
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,720
Yunqi came to ask me

153
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,060
to see him for the last time.

154
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,240
What about now?

155
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,370
He has been buried in water.

156
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:09,860
Did you

157
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,850
see clearly?

158
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:14,110
Is it Ding Yuanshan?

159
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,750
Yes, that's right.

160
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,940
Apart from his age,

161
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,980
the rest are the same as before.

162
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:24,750
Wasn't it a trap?

163
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,390
No.

164
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,370
Who attended

165
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,890
the funeral?

166
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,860
Sun Sanxuan

167
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,130
and a person called Cui Yanzhi.

168
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,430
Cui Yanzhi?

169
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Yes, she's a friend of Yunqi.

170
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,940
What did Yunqi

171
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,050
say to Ding Yuanshan?

172
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,020
Did you hear?

173
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,970
A family conversation between father and son.

174
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,490
Did they mention the Kunlun Mountains?

175
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:56,780
Yes.

176
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,120
Ding Yuanshan also said

177
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,540
he doesn't know where the Kunlun Mountains is.

178
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,230
But Yunqi knows.

179
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:09,860
How would he know?

180
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,960
Because the secret of the Kunlun Mountains

181
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:15,190
has been hidden in the Lihuo Dragon Sceptre.

182
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:17,710
Yunqi found it accidentally.

183
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:19,010
Then...

184
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,280
Did you see it?

185
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:23,130
Do you know where the Kunlun Mountains is?

186
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,330
No, he didn't tell me.

187
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,240
And the animal skin that recorded the Kunlun Mountains

188
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,080
was also destroyed.

189
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,060
So now only Yunqi knows

190
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,380
where the Kunlun Mountains is.

191
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,080
Judging from Yunqi's current mood,

192
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,730
it's meaningless

193
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:43,330
whether he knows or not.

194
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:45,140
No, he said

195
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:46,560
he wanted to find the Kunlun Mountains.

196
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:49,340
And this is his father's last wish.

197
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,460
That's great.

198
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,230
If he wants to find the Kunlun Mountains,

199
00:12:57,230 --> 00:12:59,020
he must be the Heaven Official.

200
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,880
Wu Shuang.

201
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,290
Congratulations.

202
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,290
He said he won't be the Heaven Official.

203
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,160
Master, I've figured it out.

204
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,380
I won't marry Ding Yunqi.

205
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,150
What are you talking about?

206
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,800
You can only live a normal life

207
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,160
by marrying the Heaven Official.

208
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,010
This is your only way out.

209
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,480
How many times do I need to tell you?

210
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,800
But Master,

211
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,320
I think it's so hard.

212
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,770
Silly girl.

213
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,130
Life is hard.

214
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,500
We work so hard

215
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,560
to find a little happiness

216
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:56,320
in hard work.

217
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:57,420
If you have found it,

218
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,070
then hold on tight and don't let go.

219
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,740
Some people will never find it.

220
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,430
I hope not that

221
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,570
you don't get the things

222
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,260
I didn't get.

223
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,980
I hope you can get them.

224
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:28,660
Master.

225
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,010
I want to go back to Mound-digging Sect.

226
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,160
I want to go home.

227
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,060
Okay.

228
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:40,300
Mound-digging Sect will always be your home.

229
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:43,190
But I hope

230
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,230
you can have your own home.

231
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:48,600
A...

232
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,060
small

233
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,820
home truly belongs to you.

234
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,440
Master.

235
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,470
Wu Shuang.

236
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,350
Don't give up.

237
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,770
If you give up,

238
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,400
Master won't agree either.

239
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,140
I know.

240
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:26,730
Okay.

241
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,510
Currently,

242
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:41,360
Ding Yunqi is the only one

243
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,580
who can find

244
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,220
the Kunlun Mountains.

245
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,210
But Yunqi doesn't know either

246
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:49,640
where the Kunlun Mountains is.

247
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,150
It doesn't matter.

248
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,290
What matters is if he wants to find it,

249
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:55,390
he can definitely find the most effective way.

250
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:56,780
But there's one thing.

251
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,500
There's still some misunderstanding

252
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,220
between Yunqi and me.

253
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:02,320
So you need to keep an eye on his work.

254
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,240
Pay more attention.

255
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,810
Got it, brother.

256
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,250
It's late. Go to bed.

257
00:16:09,250 --> 00:16:10,090
Okay.

258
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:20,670
Brother.

259
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,160
I'm the special member.

260
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:25,840
Why did you

261
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:27,850
assign me a task?

262
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,960
No.

263
00:16:31,090 --> 00:16:32,680
No, I'm just working.

264
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,360
My mission is to ensure your mission

265
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,460
goes well.

266
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,720
What?

267
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,490
What I said doesn't work?

268
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:43,940
It works.

269
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,910
I'm so happy.

270
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,970
You've gotten yourself together so soon.

271
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,650
If you fail a lot,

272
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,620
you'll understand one thing.

273
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:03,220
If you want to succeed,

274
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,400
don't be emotional.

275
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,510
Brother.

276
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:22,240
I used to think of your words

277
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:24,589
being too extreme

278
00:17:25,310 --> 00:17:26,480
and pessimistic.

279
00:17:29,930 --> 00:17:30,890
But now,

280
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,620
I will study hard

281
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:34,300
to become your right-hand man.

282
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:38,580
Fengling, you've really grown up.

283
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,640
If I don't grow up now,

284
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,400
I'm afraid it'll be too late.

285
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:46,770
I'll say it again.

286
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,030
I don't want you

287
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:48,580
to be involved in these things.

288
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,630
I know.

289
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,230
But you always say

290
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,410
when things come,

291
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,850
we can't avoid them.

292
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:03,700
Since we can't avoid them,

293
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,510
let's fight them.

294
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,260
You've changed a lot.

295
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,420
Brother.

296
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,030
It's not easy for you to support this family.

297
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,840
Brother Jiutian

298
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:23,310
is gone.

299
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,920
We can't lose anyone anymore.

300
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:30,950
I won't allow anyone

301
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,350
to hurt our family again.

302
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,220
Don't worry.

303
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:40,230
No matter what happens,

304
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,380
I'll always be by your side.

305
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,060
How did Cui Yanzhi

306
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,950
meet Ding Yunqi?

307
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,760
Master, don't you remember?

308
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,930
We tied him up.

309
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,700
Back then,

310
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,870
you asked me to help Yunqi

311
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,130
to find out the source of the explosives.

312
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,270
We found Cui Yi.

313
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,870
Then, we found Cui Yanzhi.

314
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:10,220
After we gave the news to Yunqi,

315
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,570
they met each other.

316
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,770
Speaking of which,

317
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,060
Yunqi didn't intentionally draw this out.

318
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,120
Master.

319
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,680
You suspect Cui Yanzhi to be...

320
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,030
A mover.

321
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,080
The movers

322
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,550
have always been playing tricks.

323
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,170
So I'm not surprised at her way

324
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,220
of appearance.

325
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:42,850
Besides,

326
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,830
they are only assigned by the Heaven Official.

327
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,220
Ding Yuanshan's rebellion

328
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:49,150
must have something to do with them.

329
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,150
We didn't find out

330
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:55,580
who set the signal flare of the movers.

331
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,920
Now that Ding Yuanshan is dead,

332
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,780
Cui Yanzhi suddenly appeared.

333
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,260
How can I not suspect?

334
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,740
Master, how about

335
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:07,170
testing them?

336
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,350
Testing?

337
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,620
How?

338
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,180
If we can test them out,

339
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,770
they won't be called movers.

340
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,640
Let's wait and see.

341
00:20:19,310 --> 00:20:20,280
Master.

342
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:22,670
Will Wu Shuang know more?

343
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,720
If Cui Yanzhi was a mover,

344
00:20:31,910 --> 00:20:33,970
Wu Shuang wouldn't have noticed it.

345
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,820
She won't lie to me.

346
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,640
[Zhu's Wonton]

347
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,750
Cigarettes!

348
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,320
Cigarettes!

349
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,580
Young man, take a pack of cigarettes.

350
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:04,420
Okay.

351
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:11,640
Cigarette seller.

352
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,810
Sir, what would you like?

353
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,170
Take it.

354
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,690
I'll pay you later.

355
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:23,780
Okay.

356
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:24,940
-Fine. OK. -Fine.

357
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,900
Cigarettes!

358
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:37,510
Yunqi.

359
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:39,390
You're back.

360
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,620
Downstairs are spies from all walks of people.

361
00:21:44,230 --> 00:21:45,730
Yunqi was really thoughtful.

362
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,630
But brother,

363
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,100
your clothes haven't been washed

364
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,020
for a long time, right?

365
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,500
I'm sorry.

366
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,010
I was just kidding, brother.

367
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,070
Have a seat.

368
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,320
Tell me, brother.

369
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,580
What is it?

370
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,540
I've opened the Dragon Sceptre.

371
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,640
What?

372
00:22:15,310 --> 00:22:16,650
The Dragon Sceptre can be opened?

373
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,290
What's inside?

374
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,990
The Book of Su.

375
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:25,300
The Heaven Official's Book of Su.

376
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:27,830
You know it?

377
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,770
Everyone in the Penta-sect

378
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,140
knows it.

379
00:22:33,290 --> 00:22:35,220
It is said that the Book of Su records

380
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,650
the location of the Kunlun Mountains

381
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,960
and how to open it.

382
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,380
Am I right, brother?

383
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,200
So

384
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,960
you can find the Kunlun Mountains?

385
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,640
Then what are we waiting for?

386
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,150
Let's pack up and go.

387
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:50,510
It's not that simple.

388
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,670
To open the Kunlun Mountains,

389
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:58,690
we must collect the Soul Pursuit Order from all factions of Penta-sect.

390
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:02,140
I asked you here today

391
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:04,320
to discuss this with you.

392
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,460
Brother.

393
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,030
Are you ready to open the Kunlun Mountains?

394
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:11,710
Yes.

395
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:15,030
But I will only open the Kunlun Mountains

396
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,130
and won't be the Heaven Official.

397
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:21,630
Fine.

398
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,310
Anyway, only your Ding family

399
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:24,860
can open it.

400
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,120
We'll follow you

401
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,460
as you decide.

402
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:31,660
If Master Ding knew this,

403
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:33,550
he'd be very pleased.

404
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:35,530
Brother.

405
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:38,050
If there's anything you need, just tell us.

406
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,820
Brother.

407
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,580
The Soul Pursuit Order of Gold Touching Sect

408
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:43,970
should be in your hands.

409
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:46,640
Yes.

410
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,620
The Soul Pursuit Order of Gold Touching Sect

411
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,740
is indeed in the sect leader's hands.

412
00:23:52,290 --> 00:23:53,550
But the Gold Touching Sect leader

413
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:55,940
is my master, Shou Wujiang.

414
00:23:56,610 --> 00:23:58,540
He has disappeared for more than ten years.

415
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,780
So, he has the Soul Pursuit Order.

416
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:03,620
I am the acting leader.

417
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,320
My master, Lao Beifeng,

418
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:14,000
has gone missing for years.

419
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,320
I still don't know where she is.

420
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:17,950
But don't worry, brother.

421
00:24:18,430 --> 00:24:19,840
As long as I find my master,

422
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,980
she will give you

423
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,060
the Soul Pursuit Order of the movers'.

424
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:28,070
I thought

425
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,000
if you two come here today,

426
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,560
I can collect three Sour Pursuit Orders.

427
00:24:34,030 --> 00:24:34,910
Brother.

428
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,850
Now you know

429
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,480
the way to open the Kunlun Mountains.

430
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,080
As for the Soul Pursuit Orders,

431
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,540
I think you'll get all of them sooner or later.

432
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,430
The most difficult ones to get

433
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:47,610
are the ones from Gold Touching Sect and Mountain-demounting Sect.

434
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,790
I think the one from the Mountain-demounting Sect is the most difficult to get.

435
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:53,100
The sect has been disbanded for more than ten years.

436
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,630
There's no one else.

437
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:56,280
Disbanded?

438
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,490
Yanzhi must know more.

439
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,140
In the third year of Tongzhi's reign,

440
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:05,240
the last sect leader was surnamed Hao.

441
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:07,040
He was 21 years old.

442
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,350
After the Mountain-demounting Sect was disbanded,

443
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:10,910
he went to the palace

444
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,050
to seek refuge with his master.

445
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,350
Where can we find him?

446
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,210
But three years ago,

447
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:20,440
the abdicated Emperor Xuantong

448
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,230
was humiliated and provoked by the Japanese on the street of Tianjin.

449
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:26,820
At that time, a guard next to Emperor Xuantong

450
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,650
killed the Japanese ronin.

451
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,560
That guard used

452
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:33,330
the martial arts of Mountain-demounting Sect.

453
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:34,760
What about that guard?

454
00:25:35,430 --> 00:25:37,070
The guard was executed later.

455
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,350
When I heard the news, I rushed to Tianjin to investigate it.

456
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,860
I found

457
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,380
many guards around Emperor Xuantong

458
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:46,310
know some

459
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:47,780
martial arts of the Mountain-demounting Sect.

460
00:25:48,710 --> 00:25:50,090
After inquiring them,

461
00:25:50,550 --> 00:25:51,980
I knew they learnt it from

462
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,160
an old eunuch who has served

463
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,220
three emperors in the palace.

464
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,200
That old eunuch was over 80 years old.

465
00:25:58,830 --> 00:26:00,300
He was Emperor Tongzhi's bodyguard.

466
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,230
Later, he was castrated for making mistakes

467
00:26:02,610 --> 00:26:04,200
and became a eunuch.

468
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,230
You mean

469
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,160
the leader of the Mountain-demounting Sect became a eunuch?

470
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:14,110
His identity, background, age

471
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,210
all match.

472
00:26:16,210 --> 00:26:18,230
When I wanted to continue the investigation,

473
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,990
Master Ding contacted me.

474
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,420
I rushed back to Shanghai.

475
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,070
That's why it didn't work out.

476
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:26,760
In the third year of Tongzhi's reign,

477
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,940
he was 21.

478
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,960
In that case,

479
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,720
if he's still alive,

480
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,570
he should be 85 years old.

481
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,790
Almost.

482
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,700
Sister.

483
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,550
Do you know

484
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,650
his old address?

485
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:45,780
Yes.

486
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,550
I'll sort out all the information

487
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,270
I collected back then and give it to you.

488
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,000
No.

489
00:27:01,130 --> 00:27:02,370
We can remove no one.

490
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,570
Brother.

491
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:07,580
Commander Hu can be put aside for now.

492
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,200
We can't let Zhou Qiuhai go.

493
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:12,830
About avenging Jiutian,

494
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,970
I'm more anxious than you, but...

495
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,740
the timing is not right.

496
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:19,630
Haven't you accepted

497
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,850
Her Ladyship's appointment?

498
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,990
Besides, with the power of Black Feather Team,

499
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,920
it's not a problem

500
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,790
to deal with Zhou Qiuhai.

501
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,900
Biao, let me ask you.

502
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,880
During the whole process

503
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,060
when Zhou Qiuhai set Jiutian up,

504
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,250
what role

505
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,350
was Cui Yanzhi playing?

506
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:38,990
Who is she?

507
00:27:39,670 --> 00:27:40,970
Is she working for Commander Hu

508
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,230
or Zhou Qiuhai?

509
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:43,920
Have you thought it through?

510
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,250
The relationship between Cui Yanzhi

511
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,510
and Commander Hu,

512
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,690
we all know.

513
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,580
But if she really works for Zhou Qiuhai,

514
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,570
if we hurt Zhou Qiuhai,

515
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:00,290
it's hurting Commander Hu.

516
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:02,810
That fatty.

517
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,540
We still can't take him down.

518
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,660
More strangely,

519
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,220
when Ding Yuanshan came back,

520
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,650
Ding Yunqi asked me to meet him

521
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,620
at Cui Yanzhi's house.

522
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,420
Why is that?

523
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:20,070
Ding Yuanshan was at Cui Yanzhi's house?

524
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,780
Yes.

525
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,810
So what's the relationship

526
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:25,650
between Ding Yuanshan and Cui Yanzhi?

527
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:31,320
It's really complicated.

528
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,350
With our current strength,

529
00:28:34,470 --> 00:28:35,570
if we don't sort out

530
00:28:35,570 --> 00:28:36,990
these people and things,

531
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,460
if we act rashly,

532
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,560
we will suffer a great loss.

533
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:42,830
Well,

534
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:44,810
what should we do now?

535
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,740
Keep a low profile

536
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,050
and build Her Ladyship's career as soon as possible.

537
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,440
Only in this way

538
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,590
can we get more support from Her Ladyship,

539
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,560
so that we can gather our power again.

540
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,330
When we are strong enough,

541
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,800
we don't have to

542
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,900
carefully analyze and judge

543
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:08,490
the relationship between the enemies.

544
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,770
We can remove whoever we want.

545
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,580
No matter who it is.

546
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,520
When God gets in the way, we kill God.

547
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,600
When Buddha stands in the way, we kill Buddha.

548
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,230
Thank you for visiting me.

549
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,280
I'm fine.

550
00:29:30,670 --> 00:29:32,770
I'm relieved to see that you're in good condition.

551
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,420
Yunqi, I've always wanted to thank you.

552
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:38,690
You brought my brother back to his fighting spirit.

553
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,200
Besides,

554
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,380
he also accepted

555
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,510
Her Ladyship's appointment

556
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:43,900
to search for the Kunlun Mountains.

557
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:48,270
That's good.

558
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,950
Then...

559
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,600
would you like to find the Kunlun Mountains with me?

560
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:12,540
Don't you want to

561
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,720
find the Kunlun Mountains?

562
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:16,830
Fengling.

563
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:18,460
We are good friends.

564
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,030
Although the Kunlun Mountains is a treasure

565
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:22,570
guarded by Penta-sect for 100 years,

566
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,140
from a different perspective,

567
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,240
it belongs to the people.

568
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:29,380
I won't stop you

569
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:30,600
if you go find it.

570
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:32,410
But this is all I can do for you.

571
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:37,620
I'm sorry, Yunqi.

572
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:39,040
It's my fault.

573
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:41,520
I neglected something very important.

574
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,370
You're from the Ding family.

575
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,520
It's indeed too much

576
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,480
to make such a request to you.

577
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:51,810
It's okay.

578
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:53,280
As you said,

579
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,670
I'm a member of the Ding family.

580
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,140
I'm not the Heaven Official.

581
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,290
Yunqi.

582
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,130
I've always admired

583
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:02,980
your intelligence and frankness.

584
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:04,490
You're right.

585
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,430
The Kunlun Mountains is of the Penta-sect

586
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,810
but it also belongs to the people.

587
00:31:08,530 --> 00:31:10,580
I want to find the Kunlun Mountains for the people.

588
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:15,880
Fengling.

589
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:17,720
Since we are friends,

590
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:20,290
I hope you can be honest with me.

591
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,610
Why must you find the Kunlun Mountains?

592
00:31:31,710 --> 00:31:33,600
You don't have to answer. It's okay.

593
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,700
But if you want to answer,

594
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:39,310
I hope you can tell the truth.

595
00:31:51,450 --> 00:31:52,460
My second brother

596
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:54,680
is gone.

597
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,370
My big brother and I

598
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,710
and Wu Shuang,

599
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,270
we almost died that day.

600
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,220
It's all because of the Kunlun Mountains.

601
00:32:07,030 --> 00:32:08,210
I don't want to see more people

602
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,550
lose their lives for this.

603
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,740
Yunqi.

604
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,550
I'm telling the truth.

605
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:23,830
I know

606
00:32:24,530 --> 00:32:25,220
there might be some misunderstanding

607
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,640
between you and my brother.

608
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,830
At least you two are hiding something from me.

609
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,310
But I really hope

610
00:32:33,110 --> 00:32:33,990
you can stop

611
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:35,550
this endless killing.

612
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,740
Please help me, Yunqi.

613
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,500
I can help you with anything else.

614
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:53,400
But I can't

615
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,580
help you with this.

616
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:00,580
You don't have to reject me immediately.

617
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:02,890
Think about it.

618
00:33:03,270 --> 00:33:04,110
No hurry.

619
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:27,580
Young Master.

620
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,490
Why do girls

621
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,320
either leave crying

622
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,670
or leave with anger from our house?

623
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,050
It's different.

624
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,700
To be honest, Young Master.

625
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,800
You're going to find the Kunlun Mountains anyway.

626
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,150
Isn't it good to go with Miss Chu?

627
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,250
I think she's nice.

628
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,110
If it were a few days ago,

629
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:47,620
I would have agreed.

630
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,550
But this time is different.

631
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,440
I promised my father

632
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,290
that I'll find the Kunlun Mountains.

633
00:33:54,870 --> 00:33:56,190
Isn't it good

634
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:57,600
to have one more helper?

635
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:00,970
If she wants to join me,

636
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,800
I might agree.

637
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:06,010
Does it matter

638
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,060
who joins whom?

639
00:34:07,310 --> 00:34:08,409
I can't figure it out.

640
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:10,630
Then do something you can.

641
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,690
Bring me the documents that Yanzhi sent.

642
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:13,690
Okay.

643
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,330
You went to see Yunqi?

644
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:45,280
He didn't agree?

645
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:49,989
Brother.

646
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:52,800
I think Yunqi has changed.

647
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,489
Why?

648
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,770
I'm not sure.

649
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,800
Anyway, I thought he could help us.

650
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,650
But this time he turned me down very quickly.

651
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,810
His father just passed away.

652
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,870
It's reasonable

653
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:13,210
if he acts abnormally.

654
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,660
He is calm.

655
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,390
Maybe

656
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:22,790
he wants to find the Kunlun Mountains himself.

657
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:26,400
Why not we go together?

658
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,130
You're going too?

659
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,160
Fengling.

660
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,890
What can you do

661
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,030
in finding the Kunlun Mountains?

662
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,940
Besides, even if we find the Kunlun Mountains,

663
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,790
how should we allocate the work?

664
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,390
Should we listen to you,

665
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,360
or Ding Yunqi?

666
00:35:51,770 --> 00:35:52,730
Fengling.

667
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,160
In this matter,

668
00:35:54,410 --> 00:35:56,050
we don't have the right to negotiate.

669
00:35:56,930 --> 00:35:58,780
We need him more.

670
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,210
And he

671
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,180
doesn't need us.

672
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:33,810
Master.

673
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,900
Yunqi is here.

674
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:36,200
Uncle.

675
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:39,380
Come, have a seat.

676
00:36:42,750 --> 00:36:43,530
Sit.

677
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:12,190
Uncle.

678
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,430
I'm here to tell you that my father...

679
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:16,230
I know.

680
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,460
Wu Shuang has told me

681
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:21,050
about your father.

682
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:22,940
I'm sorry for your loss.

683
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:24,790
Publicly speaking,

684
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,280
your father

685
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,390
has always been a good Heaven Official

686
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:33,110
except for things he did in these two years.

687
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,050
Privately speaking,

688
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,650
your father and I

689
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:41,550
are not just peers of the same sect,

690
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,610
but more

691
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,700
like brothers.

692
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,080
Shush.

693
00:37:51,910 --> 00:37:53,860
I pursued him this time

694
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,380
because of the morality of the Penta-sect.

695
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:57,510
Come here.

696
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,230
If it were your father,

697
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,080
he would do the same.

698
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,760
So,

699
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,320
I hope you can understand.

700
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,320
My father said he doesn't blame you.

701
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,310
Did he really say that?

702
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:15,820
Yes.

703
00:38:19,810 --> 00:38:21,280
We spent half of our lives together.

704
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,390
I didn't even send him off.

705
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:28,630
You should have informed me.

706
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,500
Uncle,

707
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,020
because it's my father,

708
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,530
I really...

709
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,990
I...

710
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,160
I understand.

711
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,130
I understand.

712
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,780
If I really meet your father,

713
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,620
I will also

714
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:46,020
ask him about everything.

715
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,070
Why did he do that?

716
00:38:50,050 --> 00:38:51,860
Is there any misunderstanding?

717
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:53,410
Any hidden trouble?

718
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,280
But he's already gone.

719
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,580
It's useless to talk about this.

720
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,370
But don't worry.

721
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:05,420
In the future,

722
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:07,770
after I find out the truth,

723
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,290
I will clear your father's name.

724
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,080
Thank you for your understanding.

725
00:39:15,710 --> 00:39:16,320
Uncle,

726
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,900
my father asked me

727
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:18,950
to tell you something.

728
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:20,750
Go ahead.

729
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:44,890
Zhou Qiuhai, leader of the Mound-digging Sect

730
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:46,100
receives the the Heaven Official's Order.

731
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,050
Uncle, there's no need for courtesy.

732
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:48,620
No.

733
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:50,420
We can't break the rules.

734
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:55,610
Sorry.

735
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,340
I forgot to ask your Young Heaven Official

736
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:00,060
when are you going to take over the throne?

737
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:04,890
I'm not the Heaven Official.

738
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,850
Then why do you hold this Soul Pursuit Order?

739
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,360
I'm here to pass the last order

740
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:13,290
of my father on behalf of him.

741
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:19,000
Zhou Qiuhai, leader of the Mound-digging Sect receives the Heaven Official's Order.

742
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:20,980
What are you doing?

743
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:25,890
My father said

744
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,360
to disband the Penta-sect.

745
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,180
All sect leaders, return the Soul Pursuit Order.

746
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:31,590
The Penta-sect will end.

747
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,760
All disciples don't need to follow the sect rules.

748
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,760
Disband the Penta-sect?

749
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:48,820
Yes.

750
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,760
Did your father say that himself?

751
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,530
Return the Soul Pursuit Order.

752
00:41:04,910 --> 00:41:05,790
Disband the Penta-sect.

753
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:06,710
I don't want to hear it.

754
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,340
Uncle.

755
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,320
I don't want to hear it.

756
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:13,900
Ding Yuanshan.

757
00:41:14,990 --> 00:41:16,420
Ding Yuanshan.

758
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,100
After all,

759
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,170
you are the traitor

760
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:23,850
who betrayed our sect.

761
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:26,500
Traitor.

762
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,280
Penta-sect has more than 100 years of history

763
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:33,970
and you just disband it with a word?

764
00:41:35,610 --> 00:41:37,460
The sects are of the same branch.

765
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:40,100
We are connected by blood and treat each other wholeheartedly.

766
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,870
It's been centuries.

767
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:44,010
We've been like this for centuries.

768
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:47,700
This is home.

769
00:41:47,870 --> 00:41:49,430
The home for so many.

770
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:52,740
How can you disband it with a word?

771
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,350
What will the kids do

772
00:41:55,350 --> 00:41:56,690
without it?

773
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:59,670
Who will take care of them?

774
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,560
Who will protect them?

775
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,020
Traitor! Traitor!

776
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,640
Ding Yuanshan, you traitor!

777
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,420
Uncle.

778
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:17,730
I know it's hard for you to accept it.

779
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:19,220
But after Penta-sect is disbanded,

780
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:20,550
you can still take your disciples

781
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:22,770
to live a new and better life.

782
00:42:23,030 --> 00:42:24,620
You don't have to obey

783
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:26,090
the cruel rules of Penta-sect anymore.

784
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,510
Cruel?

785
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,830
Do you think I don't know how cruel it is?

786
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,280
It's cruel because

787
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,660
every disciple

788
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,680
has a mission.

789
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,670
Our lives are given by Penta-sect.

790
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:54,520
Our lives belong to Penta-sect after all.

791
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:57,090
So every Penta-sect disciple

792
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,440
must protect the legacy left by our ancestors

793
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:00,660
and protect the Kunlun Mountains

794
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,880
left by our ancestors.

795
00:43:13,470 --> 00:43:14,180
By the way,

796
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,690
I forgot to ask you.

797
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:19,430
If you disband Penta-sect,

798
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:20,960
what about the Kunlun Mountains?

799
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:23,500
I've opened

800
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,020
the Heaven Official's Book of Su in the ragon Sceptre.

801
00:43:25,530 --> 00:43:26,610
It clearly said that

802
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,110
the treasure of the Kunlun Mountains is not privately owned by Penta-sect,

803
00:43:31,070 --> 00:43:33,370
but by the whole world since it comes from the world.

804
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,310
Where is the Book of Su now?

805
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:37,830
It's destroyed.

806
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,970
The Book of Su must have recorded

807
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:41,140
the location of the Kunlun Mountains.

808
00:43:41,620 --> 00:43:42,030
Yes.

809
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:46,350
You insist on not being the Heaven Official?

810
00:43:48,790 --> 00:43:49,460
No.

811
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,130
Then do you want to take the Kunlun Mountains?

812
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:53,700
I'll fulfill my father's last wish.

813
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:01,510
I understand.

814
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:03,650
Disband the Penta-sect

815
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,090
and get the Soul Pursuit Orders.

816
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:08,610
Then you won't have any obstacles

817
00:44:08,610 --> 00:44:10,500
and get the Kunlun Mountains, right?

818
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:12,520
I will go to the Kunlun Mountains.

819
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,570
But I won't take it for myself.

820
00:44:15,730 --> 00:44:16,200
Uncle.

821
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:17,720
Goodbye.

822
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:33,720
Mound-digging Sect.

823
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:37,420
-Yes. -Yes. Yes.

824
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,890
Yes.
