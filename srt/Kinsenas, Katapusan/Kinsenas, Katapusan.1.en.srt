1
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:01,583
Teacher Maita, they're calling
all teachers to the Faculty room now.

2
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:02,958
Alright, I'll be right there.

3
00:01:02,958 --> 00:01:03,989
Thank you!

4
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,125
Class, here's your problem set, okay?

5
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,167
I just have to attend a meeting
at the Faculty room.

6
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:12,025
When you're done answering,
just place your notebook on my table.

7
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,000
Alright?

8
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,292
- Yes, Ma'am!
- Okay, good.

9
00:01:22,542 --> 00:01:24,875
Let's see you try, then…
Ask Ana out on a date!

10
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,917
Hey, would you leave me alone?

11
00:01:28,942 --> 00:01:31,067
Dates are the farthest thing on my mind!

12
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:33,561
How about you finish
your studies first, Ronnie?

13
00:01:33,586 --> 00:01:35,582
That way, you don't
look like a scrub!

14
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:42,225
So what now? Not even a first date
and you already got dumped!

15
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:47,119
Learn how to solve a Math problem
before you act like Mr. Loverboy!

16
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:51,250
So, how about it?
Go out with me!

17
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:53,526
Stop playing hard to get!

18
00:01:53,958 --> 00:01:56,000
No one's ever turned me down.

19
00:01:56,375 --> 00:01:58,958
Oh, yeah?

20
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,725
Then I guess I'll be the first.

21
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,250
Leave me alone, Ronnie!

22
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:03,608
I'm busy!

23
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:06,174
He's got no game!

24
00:02:06,276 --> 00:02:08,808
Don't make me look a fool
in front of my buddies, Ana!

25
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,417
What are you on?

26
00:02:10,558 --> 00:02:13,142
If you don't want to get rejected,
then stop asking!

27
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,250
You're such a snob!

28
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,125
But that's what I like about you…
hard-to-get!

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,500
Whoa!

30
00:02:20,542 --> 00:02:22,250
Cut it out!

31
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,058
Hey! Hey! Ouch!

32
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:31,417
Maybe if you stuck your noses in a book,
you wouldn't be such idiots!

33
00:02:32,642 --> 00:02:35,308
- Girls in this school are scary!
- You said it!

34
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,875
- They can't even take jokes!
- Can't mess around with them!

35
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:41,167
Is there a problem?

36
00:02:41,917 --> 00:02:44,167
No, ma'am. We're just
having a bit of fun.

37
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,375
You're lucky you're a girl.

38
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,708
Whatever, take your seat.

39
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,250
Quiet!

40
00:03:06,917 --> 00:03:11,708
You shouldn't let Ronnie or anyone
treat you rudely like that.

41
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:15,250
Ronnie's been bugging me
since last year.

42
00:03:15,667 --> 00:03:18,333
I just gave him a pass today.

43
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:22,108
He'd better not push his luck
or he'll have my Papa to answer to!

44
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:24,292
How old is your dad?

45
00:03:25,142 --> 00:03:27,058
Ah, my dad?

46
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:28,708
He's not that old.

47
00:03:28,733 --> 00:03:32,442
Besides, he doesn't like
talking about his age.

48
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:35,460
Actually, his birthday's next week.

49
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:39,583
Aren't you that new girl?

50
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:42,083
You're pretty gutsy for a new girl!

51
00:03:42,683 --> 00:03:46,142
But why are you such a loner?

52
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:50,292
You've been around for a couple of months
but you still keep to yourself.

53
00:03:51,225 --> 00:03:53,100
That's just how I am.

54
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:54,875
I'm very shy.

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,650
I only just moved here, after all.

56
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:00,683
I want to invite you
to my dad's birthday!

57
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:03,083
Since we're friends now, aren't we?

58
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:05,000
Oh, I don't know about that!

59
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:07,525
But sure, if you insist.

60
00:04:08,642 --> 00:04:11,850
From now on, we're bestfriends!

61
00:04:11,875 --> 00:04:13,792
Sure, bestfriend!

62
00:04:13,817 --> 00:04:17,983
I finally have a bestfriend in school!

63
00:04:18,375 --> 00:04:21,500
Are your parents living here, too?

64
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:23,458
No, they're not.

65
00:04:24,542 --> 00:04:26,042
Both of them are abroad.

66
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:28,780
They even told me that
after this school year,

67
00:04:28,804 --> 00:04:31,308
they're taking me there to study.

68
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,750
That sounds great!

69
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:36,792
You have the opportunity to study abroad.

70
00:04:36,792 --> 00:04:38,542
Do you have other siblings?

71
00:04:38,542 --> 00:04:40,250
I'm an only child.

72
00:04:40,917 --> 00:04:41,917
What about you?

73
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,333
Blessed to be an only child!

74
00:04:45,558 --> 00:04:49,100
Hey, will you go with me somewhere
for my dad's birthday?

75
00:04:49,125 --> 00:04:50,792
I need to get him something.

76
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,542
Ana.

77
00:04:54,917 --> 00:04:56,250
How's school?

78
00:04:56,275 --> 00:04:57,942
I heard you came home late.

79
00:04:58,417 --> 00:04:59,799
I'm doing okay, Pa.

80
00:04:59,917 --> 00:05:02,375
I just dropped by somewhere
on my way home.

81
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,733
I was with my friend Beth.

82
00:05:04,292 --> 00:05:05,292
Who's Beth?

83
00:05:05,725 --> 00:05:08,725
This is the first time I'm hearing
about a classmate named Beth.

84
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,392
That's because she just
transferred a month ago.

85
00:05:12,417 --> 00:05:14,557
We only became close today.

86
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,417
Sir?

87
00:05:17,458 --> 00:05:18,458
Ma'am?

88
00:05:18,483 --> 00:05:20,833
I wonder if I may be excused
for a couple of hours.

89
00:05:20,858 --> 00:05:23,192
I'm needed at home.
I'll be back shortly.

90
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:26,017
What's the matter, Nanny Tasing?
What happened?

91
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,583
Ah, it's nothing, Sir.

92
00:05:27,608 --> 00:05:29,525
It's just that my nephew's coming home.

93
00:05:30,776 --> 00:05:34,642
Oh, right! Sorry, Nanny Tasing,
I keep forgetting about that.

94
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:37,042
You should go. You don't want
to be on the road after dark.

95
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,241
Okay, Ma'am. Thank you.

96
00:05:38,266 --> 00:05:39,683
I'll go ahead.

97
00:05:40,042 --> 00:05:41,375
- Nanny Tasing.
- Sir?

98
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:44,100
Just go home, but don't go on ahead.

99
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,183
You're always pulling my leg, Sir!

100
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:47,975
I'm going home now, Sir.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:48,975
- Okay, Nanny Tasing.
- We'll see you.

102
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,558
Take care, Nanny Tasing.

103
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,542
Be safe.

104
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:55,225
That's how they speak in Batangas.

105
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:59,518
Ah, Ma? Can I invite Beth
to Papa's birthday party?

106
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:00,850
Of course you can!

107
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:03,125
We'd love to meet all your friends.

108
00:06:03,475 --> 00:06:05,017
These days,

109
00:06:05,042 --> 00:06:08,588
we have to make sure you don't associate
with the wrong sort.

110
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,667
Okay, Mama.

111
00:06:09,692 --> 00:06:11,433
But Beth is nice, Mama.

112
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,875
By the way, Love.

113
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,583
Do you have anyone else
in mind for the guest list?

114
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,268
The guest list?

115
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:21,333
I think we've invited enough guests,
don't you think?

116
00:06:21,745 --> 00:06:26,453
We don't want more people finding out
how old I'm getting…

117
00:06:27,517 --> 00:06:29,975
Why do you have to feel bad
about your age, Papa?

118
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,875
A few more years
and you'll be growing white hair!

119
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:36,025
Don't be too harsh
on your Daddy, sweetie.

120
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:41,558
That's okay. Daddy's still very handsome!

121
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:42,458
- That's what I like to hear.
- Isn't he?

122
00:06:42,458 --> 00:06:43,583
Mama's trying to get
on your good side.

123
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:44,375
Your mother knows things…

124
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:45,892
Love!

125
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,221
Would you like to have the food catered?

126
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,869
And maybe we can just email the invitations
so we can save on costs.

127
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:54,333
I'm sending out the emails right now.

128
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,083
About the catering service,
I'll let you handle that.

129
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:58,483
You're better at that sort of thing.

130
00:06:58,786 --> 00:07:02,166
But don't forget to order my favorite.

131
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,250
Adobo!

132
00:07:03,917 --> 00:07:07,083
Of course! How could I forget?

133
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:11,458
It's your birthday,
and that's your only request?

134
00:07:12,417 --> 00:07:15,542
You know I can live on nothing
but Adobo and you.

135
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,048
Hmph!

136
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,500
Flatterer!

137
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:21,458
I swear, if I ever catch you
with another woman…

138
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,958
Hey, why'd you turn quiet?

139
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:37,667
Well, you're here now.

140
00:07:37,692 --> 00:07:41,358
You know I put all of
my work down once you're there.

141
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,208
Really?

142
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,250
Of course!

143
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:48,789
So? Is it hard for me yet?

144
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,510
Is it rearing to go?

145
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:54,333
It won't mind going
all night long with you!

146
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:03,010
Talk dirty to me.

147
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,517
I want to hear you whisper in my ear

148
00:08:06,542 --> 00:08:08,250
and your breathing.

149
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:01,333
This is love!

150
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:06,346
This is what true love looks like!

151
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:42,158
That exam gave me a headache!

152
00:09:43,392 --> 00:09:44,475
I know right.

153
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,292
It made me dizzy.

154
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,167
I just remembered,
it's Papa's birthday next week!

155
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:51,858
Don't miss it, okay?

156
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,417
Is it really okay for me to go?

157
00:09:54,442 --> 00:09:55,983
You're going to bring me to the party?

158
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:57,378
Of course!

159
00:09:57,403 --> 00:09:59,695
You'll be my guest!

160
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:02,517
Alright, just don't leave my side.

161
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:03,542
Promise I won't!

162
00:10:03,567 --> 00:10:04,567
I got you.

163
00:10:04,596 --> 00:10:05,893
I'm excited!

164
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,792
Let's go back to the classroom.

165
00:10:23,542 --> 00:10:26,344
- Okay, guys! Good job!
- Yes!

166
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:30,458
Miguel, you're in charge of the pitch
with Mr. Cruz. You can handle it!

167
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,333
Yes, sir!

168
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:35,196
I'll be with Ms. Charms and Danny,
so it's a done-deal!

169
00:10:35,221 --> 00:10:36,637
- It'll be a piece of cake!
- Okay, good!

170
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:37,708
Sita.

171
00:10:37,792 --> 00:10:38,583
Sita!

172
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,042
- Yes, sir?
- The flight for my wife's birthday,

173
00:10:41,042 --> 00:10:41,792
is everything in order?

174
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:43,917
Yes, Sir. The Admin has
already been informed as well.

175
00:10:43,917 --> 00:10:46,333
- Very good.
- Sita, please follow up on the Releasing.

176
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:48,650
I already filed the requisition
the other day.

177
00:10:49,042 --> 00:10:49,958
- Okay.
- Okay.

178
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,150
Thank you, guys!

179
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,667
Job well done! Thank you!
Adjourned! Adjourned!

180
00:10:54,667 --> 00:10:55,417
Thank you! Thank you!

181
00:10:55,417 --> 00:10:56,583
- Adjourned!
- Adjourned!

182
00:10:57,542 --> 00:11:00,125
Ah, sir? May I have a minute?

183
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:02,375
There's something
I wanted to tell you.

184
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,125
Okay.

185
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:05,275
- Ah, excuse me, sir.
- Karen.

186
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:10,875
Ah, Sir, nevermind.
Maybe another day.

187
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,275
Okay. Karen, come with me.

188
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:16,042
Excuse me.

189
00:11:20,083 --> 00:11:23,500
Sir, have you read the message
I sent you last night?

190
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:24,750
No, I haven't.

191
00:11:24,917 --> 00:11:25,917
What is it about?

192
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:28,750
Please check it, Sir.

193
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:56,208
Son of a bitch.

194
00:11:56,233 --> 00:12:00,527
Didn't I tell you not to text
or message me while I'm at home?

195
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,089
Are you out of your mind?

196
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,938
Sorry, sir.

197
00:12:08,039 --> 00:12:12,375
You sent me a nude picture?
Are you kidding me?

198
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,500
You idiot. Get out of my face!

199
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:23,484
Unbelievable.

200
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,667
For your fantastic presentation!

201
00:12:28,083 --> 00:12:29,188
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

202
00:12:29,213 --> 00:12:31,463
- For the road, yeah?
- Yes.

203
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,125
Wait, wait.

204
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:38,167
Going back to the subject of your wife.

205
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,792
What's going on with her?

206
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,590
It's nothing…

207
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
I don't know.

208
00:12:44,583 --> 00:12:46,154
What's up with you ladies?

209
00:12:46,179 --> 00:12:48,971
You keep getting jealous over nothing!

210
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:51,083
I don't understand
what goes on in her head.

211
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:52,525
She tells me I'm not faithful to her.

212
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:53,933
If she doesn't give it a rest,

213
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:57,457
I just might give her something
to be jealous about for real.

214
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,417
Well, Sir…

215
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:02,350
Maybe madame really just loves you.

216
00:13:02,375 --> 00:13:05,625
I can understand where she's coming from.

217
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:09,517
You really do have such
a strong sex appeal, Sir.

218
00:13:09,542 --> 00:13:10,542
Seriously?

219
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:13,083
What sex appeal?

220
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,583
It's true!

221
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,542
You don't believe me?

222
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,558
It's true, Sir.

223
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:24,500
My husband doesn't turn me on
as much as you do.

224
00:13:31,792 --> 00:13:34,375
Why do you look so nervous?

225
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:28,083
Do you want me now?

226
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:30,250
Huh?

227
00:15:28,792 --> 00:15:29,792
Love.

228
00:15:30,058 --> 00:15:32,600
I'm sorry, I think I'm going
to be home late tonight.

229
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:37,083
I'm still working on my presentation
for the board.

230
00:15:37,142 --> 00:15:40,308
And I need to double check
what Miguel prepared.

231
00:15:40,333 --> 00:15:42,808
I want everything to be perfect
for this big client.

232
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,917
No worries, Love. Just text me
when you're on your way home.

233
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,817
But don't take too long.

234
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:50,750
Okay, Love. I'll text you, alright?

235
00:15:50,775 --> 00:15:52,150
Take care. I love you.

236
00:16:56,167 --> 00:16:57,500
Nanny Tasing?

237
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,542
Ma'am?

238
00:16:58,583 --> 00:16:59,583
Ma'am, what's wrong?

239
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:03,500
The car I booked just arrived.
Could you watch over Ana while I'm out?

240
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,208
- Yes, Ma'am.
- I'm going to Conrado's office.

241
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:08,542
I'm feeling nervous,
I don't know why.

242
00:17:08,542 --> 00:17:10,042
Oh, no, Ma'am. Please be careful.

243
00:17:10,042 --> 00:17:11,208
Okay, okay, I'll leave you in charge.

244
00:17:11,208 --> 00:17:12,750
Okay, Ma'am. Don't worry.

245
00:18:17,792 --> 00:18:18,792
What the hell!

246
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,375
What are you still doing in here?

247
00:18:22,667 --> 00:18:24,216
We need to talk.

248
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,044
Just this once.

249
00:18:28,083 --> 00:18:29,083
Karen…

250
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,917
Whatever happened between us,

251
00:18:33,042 --> 00:18:34,375
think nothing of it.

252
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:37,125
You have a family, so do I…

253
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:39,708
You should go home to them.

254
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:41,275
Your family's waiting for you.

255
00:18:44,633 --> 00:18:47,383
Which of the things we did
would you like me to forget?

256
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,375
Everything that happened to us?

257
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:53,083
You want me to forget all of it?

258
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:54,667
Just like that?

259
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:01,919
I've been in love with you
for a long time, Conrado.

260
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,208
I don't love my husband anymore.

261
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,625
Karen,

262
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:11,167
my problem is, I love my wife.

263
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:12,958
So if I were you,

264
00:19:13,542 --> 00:19:14,542
I'd head on home.

265
00:19:24,542 --> 00:19:26,372
Conrado.

266
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,542
- Love!
- Hey, Love!

267
00:21:14,542 --> 00:21:15,917
What are you doing here?

268
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,083
I was just leaving.
We almost missed each other.

269
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:23,583
I was worried about you so
I thought I'd help you with work.

270
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,250
You're so thoughtful.

271
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,875
You caught me just in time.

272
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:29,475
Wait, where's Ana?
Who's looking after her?

273
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,750
Nanny Tasing is back home.

274
00:21:30,775 --> 00:21:32,858
She got back early.

275
00:21:33,558 --> 00:21:36,267
Okay. I'll just go grab my stuff
and we can head home, okay?

276
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:37,292
Wait there.

277
00:21:37,317 --> 00:21:38,317
I'll be right back.

278
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,375
Has the Madame arrived at the office?

279
00:22:06,683 --> 00:22:08,683
Happy Birthday!

280
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,125
Thank you! Thank you!

281
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,933
Thank you! Thank you!

282
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:15,443
Cheers!

283
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,892
Thank you very much.

284
00:22:17,917 --> 00:22:19,201
Thank you, Darling.

285
00:22:19,583 --> 00:22:21,764
He'll melt if you stare him down
a second longer.

286
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:26,042
Something's different about you.

287
00:22:26,958 --> 00:22:28,717
But let me just remind you,

288
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:32,693
snakes will be dealt
with in our company.

289
00:22:33,875 --> 00:22:35,958
What are you talking about?

290
00:22:36,667 --> 00:22:37,667
You know what,

291
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:41,083
you're going to end up an old maid

292
00:22:41,958 --> 00:22:43,750
because you're evil-minded!

293
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:57,750
- Come, sweetie, let's go over there.
- Okay, Ma.

294
00:23:04,832 --> 00:23:07,916
- Is your guest coming yet?
- Yes, she is. She says she's nearby.

295
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:21,892
Hi, Ana.

296
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:23,397
Yes, hello Miss Sita.

297
00:23:24,225 --> 00:23:26,933
You've grown so big.
You're a lady now.

298
00:23:26,958 --> 00:23:29,083
Not at all! I'm still a child.

299
00:23:29,108 --> 00:23:32,233
Papa will get angry
if he hears you say that.

300
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:34,590
You're telling me!

301
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:37,225
Your father's got a selfish streak.

302
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,958
What does it mean?

303
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,083
It means he can be
so protective of you.

304
00:23:41,108 --> 00:23:43,068
Ah, okay, Ma.

305
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:44,958
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

306
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,767
Ma'am, I really love the food!

307
00:23:47,792 --> 00:23:50,625
On our company's anniversary,

308
00:23:50,625 --> 00:23:52,522
I hope we'll serve the same menu.

309
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:53,933
Oh, no problem! Sure thing!

310
00:23:53,958 --> 00:23:56,875
I'll give you
their contact number, alright?

311
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:59,900
If you want more food,
go ahead and eat some more.

312
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,583
I have an idea.

313
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:05,017
I'll save your number,

314
00:24:05,042 --> 00:24:08,208
then I'll text you when we need
to contact the catering service.

315
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:09,273
Is that okay?

316
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,250
Alright, sure.
No problem.

317
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:13,317
Okay, Ma'am.
What's your number?

318
00:24:13,725 --> 00:24:15,100
Okay, it's 0117--

319
00:24:15,125 --> 00:24:18,517
Ah, Ma! I think Beth's here.
I'll go bring her here.

320
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:19,680
Okay, go ahead.

321
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:21,996
- Excuse me, Miss Sita.
- Okay. Thank you.

322
00:24:22,167 --> 00:24:26,583
0117-822-8715.

323
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:28,167
Sir!

324
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,167
Happy Birthday!

325
00:24:29,662 --> 00:24:30,579
Thank you, Miguel!

326
00:24:30,604 --> 00:24:32,770
The food's a winner, Sir! It's really good!

327
00:24:33,125 --> 00:24:35,417
It's really filling me up!
This is my third helping.

328
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:40,334
Don't worry,
just keep going back for more.

329
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:42,892
Miguel, I heard from your clients

330
00:24:42,917 --> 00:24:44,308
and they have positive feedback!

331
00:24:44,333 --> 00:24:46,650
- Congratulations! Good job!
- Thank you, sir.

332
00:24:46,767 --> 00:24:51,183
Of course, I learned from the best!

333
00:24:51,208 --> 00:24:52,917
You're my mentor!

334
00:24:53,475 --> 00:24:55,308
- Isn't that right?
- Thank you. Thank you.

335
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,792
So I'm very grateful. Thanks again.

336
00:24:56,817 --> 00:24:58,233
Welcome. Welcome!

337
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:00,917
By the way, Sir. Sir Mike's coming.

338
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:01,933
Okay, good.

339
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,958
- Okay, okay, I'll go ahead.
- Okay, just eat.

340
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:04,917
Happy birthday!

341
00:25:04,942 --> 00:25:06,442
Thank you. Thank you!

342
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,983
- Happy Birth--
- Please don't do that.

343
00:25:23,112 --> 00:25:24,365
Why?

344
00:25:26,833 --> 00:25:28,295
My family's right over there.

345
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:30,623
So?

346
00:25:35,542 --> 00:25:36,542
You can't do this.

347
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:45,667
I can't afford to lose my family.

348
00:25:58,267 --> 00:25:59,808
It's so hard being single.

349
00:25:59,833 --> 00:26:01,708
That's very true. It really is tough.

350
00:26:01,733 --> 00:26:03,592
- Thanks for the chat, Ma'am.
- Oh, no problem.

351
00:26:07,083 --> 00:26:09,125
Sita's great, isn't she?

352
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,917
She's very loyal.

353
00:26:11,263 --> 00:26:13,180
Loyal to the company.

354
00:26:13,750 --> 00:26:15,708
- Sita?
- Yes.

355
00:26:16,167 --> 00:26:17,833
It's the reason why
she doesn't get along with everybody.

356
00:26:18,292 --> 00:26:23,625
When she knows she's right,
you can't bribe her no matter what.

357
00:26:23,917 --> 00:26:26,592
Really? That's good, right?

358
00:26:26,733 --> 00:26:28,533
Can't wait for you to meet them.

359
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:31,375
Pa! Ma!

360
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:34,292
This is Beth, my friend from school.

361
00:26:34,795 --> 00:26:36,308
Good afternoon, ma'am!

362
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,154
Happy birthday, sir.

363
00:26:39,053 --> 00:26:40,100
Hi!

364
00:26:40,125 --> 00:26:42,667
- Have a seat! Have a seat!
- You can sit down.

365
00:26:44,167 --> 00:26:46,958
- Give your guest something to eat, okay?
- Okay, Ma.

366
00:26:53,458 --> 00:26:55,917
Your classmate is very pretty!

367
00:26:55,942 --> 00:26:57,150
Yes, isn't she?

368
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:06,475
Thank you so much.

369
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,542
- Would you like something to eat, Ma'am?
- Oh, sure, sure.

370
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:13,667
Conrado!

371
00:27:14,917 --> 00:27:16,792
Happy Birthday!
Mike!

372
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:18,833
How are you?

373
00:27:19,308 --> 00:27:20,267
- My accountant.
- Happy Birthday!

374
00:27:20,292 --> 00:27:21,433
Hello! Thank you!

375
00:27:21,458 --> 00:27:22,542
Love, I'll leave you to it.

376
00:27:22,567 --> 00:27:23,567
Hi!

377
00:27:23,624 --> 00:27:24,601
- Sit down.
- Have a seat.

378
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:26,668
Come with me for a sec.

379
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,154
Hello, how are you?

380
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,750
Sir?

381
00:28:00,958 --> 00:28:04,208
Sir, here are the documents that you need
to sign for tomorrow.

382
00:28:04,458 --> 00:28:08,125
And you have a board meeting
tomorrow with Sir Mike.

383
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,342
And...

384
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:13,748
I'll be heading home.

385
00:28:16,721 --> 00:28:18,044
Ah, it's already six o'clock.

386
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,147
Has everyone left?

387
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:22,750
Sir, nobody's left.

388
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,417
They all went home.

389
00:28:24,917 --> 00:28:25,917
Okay.

390
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:31,500
Okay, check the rooms
and make sure everything's locked.

391
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:32,692
- Okay?
- Okay, sir.

392
00:28:32,717 --> 00:28:35,217
So then you can go.
I still have a lot of work to do.

393
00:28:36,125 --> 00:28:37,125
Yes, sir.

394
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,542
Sir?

395
00:28:41,708 --> 00:28:42,708
What?

396
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,292
Take care.

397
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,333
Thank you, Sita.

398
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:49,917
Goodbye, Sir.

399
00:28:58,375 --> 00:29:06,583
Hello!

400
00:29:21,333 --> 00:29:23,500
Hello!

401
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,558
Yes? Are you Beth,
the friend of my daughter?

402
00:29:32,583 --> 00:29:34,459
Yes, it's mhee!
How are you?

403
00:29:37,125 --> 00:29:38,375
Belated happy birthday.

404
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Sir?

405
00:29:54,458 --> 00:29:55,458
Yes, Sita.

406
00:29:56,458 --> 00:30:02,750
Sir, I'd like to remind you
of your board meeting at 11:00 a.m.

407
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:04,542
Okay, okay.

408
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,417
Get the conference room ready

409
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:09,709
and please tell the Accounting department
to be present.

410
00:30:10,833 --> 00:30:13,000
- Noted, Sir.
- Thank you, Sita.

411
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,083
Thank you.

412
00:30:23,792 --> 00:30:28,250
Are you busy?

413
00:30:58,208 --> 00:31:00,375
Hey! Who are you talking to?

414
00:31:00,496 --> 00:31:02,888
You seem all giddy!

415
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,833
- We're too young for that!
- It's just a crush.

416
00:31:05,458 --> 00:31:06,625
Do I know him?

417
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:09,208
Maybe.

418
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:13,792
One of our classmates?

419
00:31:14,542 --> 00:31:15,542
Nope.

420
00:31:15,991 --> 00:31:17,366
From a different class?

421
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:20,017
Possibly.

422
00:31:20,042 --> 00:31:21,708
You love making me guess!

423
00:31:21,917 --> 00:31:23,225
Is he tall?

424
00:31:23,250 --> 00:31:24,250
Tanned?

425
00:31:25,875 --> 00:31:26,958
Maybe.

426
00:31:27,417 --> 00:31:30,458
He's kind, handsome…

427
00:31:30,667 --> 00:31:32,083
He's got gorgeous eyes…

428
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,308
Let me see that!

429
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:35,333
Hey!

430
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:39,125
I'll show you if I want to!

431
00:31:39,375 --> 00:31:40,875
Don't be so pushy!

432
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:54,208
How's your day?

433
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:55,167
Still busy?

434
00:31:55,167 --> 00:31:56,250
Why are you not responding?

435
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:57,250
Okay I will not disturb you...

436
00:31:57,250 --> 00:31:57,958
Hey!

437
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:44,292
Sorry...

438
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:58,542
Yeah just busy at work...

439
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:12,333
Stop messaging me...

440
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:24,625
Hi, sorry late response...

441
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:34,667
That's okay. How's your day?

442
00:33:38,125 --> 00:33:41,250
I'm good... you?

443
00:33:45,667 --> 00:33:48,042
Fine, still in your office?

444
00:33:51,667 --> 00:33:54,208
Yes? Why?

445
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:04,917
You work too hard…
you should relax sometimes.

446
00:34:07,875 --> 00:34:12,417
Thanks, okay i gotta go! Bye!

447
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,417
Going home?

448
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,833
Yes, my wife is waiting...

449
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:33,750
Ouch! Trying to make me jealous?

450
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:45,292
What?! hahaha... you silly kid!

451
00:34:50,708 --> 00:34:53,542
No, I'm not a kid anymore!

452
00:35:01,958 --> 00:35:09,792
Yes you are... like my daughter.

453
00:35:14,208 --> 00:35:17,875
Yup maybe, but my mind
is like your age...

454
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,625
Want proof?

455
00:35:33,792 --> 00:35:36,208
What do you mean?

456
00:35:55,875 --> 00:35:56,875
Yes, Love.

457
00:35:57,750 --> 00:35:59,708
Want me to get you something on the way?

458
00:35:59,833 --> 00:36:02,042
How did you know?

459
00:36:02,292 --> 00:36:04,167
Can you drop by the grocery store, love?

460
00:36:04,192 --> 00:36:06,525
I'll text you what I need. Love you!

461
00:36:06,667 --> 00:36:09,917
Alright, text me a list
so I don't forget.

462
00:36:10,208 --> 00:36:11,460
I love you, too.

463
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:11,083
Okay, guys, another job well done!
Good work, team!

464
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:16,517
And to celebrate, Sita
and I discussed your bonus.

465
00:39:16,542 --> 00:39:17,875
Yes!

466
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,542
That's what I'm talking about!

467
00:39:19,542 --> 00:39:20,542
Okay! Okay!

468
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:24,083
Okay, guys. Tomorrow, sir Mike
will be in charge of you.

469
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:25,517
Okay!

470
00:39:25,542 --> 00:39:27,375
Melba and I have
some business to attend to.

471
00:39:27,458 --> 00:39:29,195
So Mike will head
the project in the mean time.

472
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:32,958
Hang on, Conrado. Do you mean to give Ana
a little brother? Is that what you meant?

473
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:35,609
Not exactly!

474
00:39:36,058 --> 00:39:39,558
Everyone back to work if you want me
to prepare the bonuses.

475
00:39:39,583 --> 00:39:40,583
Okay!

476
00:39:41,292 --> 00:39:43,042
Should Sita ever gets married,

477
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:45,017
I'll pay for the roasted pig!

478
00:39:45,042 --> 00:39:46,484
That should keep her from being grouchy!

479
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,484
She's such a grouch!

480
00:39:51,827 --> 00:39:53,565
You're too much, Sir Mike.

481
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:59,354
Karen, your phone's ringing.

482
00:39:59,379 --> 00:40:01,476
You should answer it,
it might be a client.

483
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:05,210
Okay, come on, let's go.

484
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:08,914
Hello... R and E Realty.

485
00:40:32,042 --> 00:40:35,958
- Hi, Sir! Congratulations!
I want to say goodbye.

486
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,449
I'll be sending
a resignation letter

487
00:40:38,473 --> 00:40:40,542
tomorrow effective
in fifteen days.

488
00:40:40,542 --> 00:40:43,167
For everyone's peace of mind.

489
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:47,416
My husband and I are back in good terms
and I wish you well, too.

490
00:40:50,601 --> 00:40:53,308
Hi, Sir. How are you?
You must be very busy!

491
00:40:53,332 --> 00:40:55,250
Send me a picture, won't you?

492
00:41:32,872 --> 00:41:34,468
- Bro.
- Yeah?

493
00:41:34,892 --> 00:41:35,975
You look jumpy.

494
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,750
No.

495
00:41:36,775 --> 00:41:38,942
Take a look at our plans
for the BGC project.

496
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,500
Damnit!

497
00:41:41,583 --> 00:41:43,664
You're always playing hard to get!

498
00:41:51,808 --> 00:41:54,058
Hi, sis! How are you?

499
00:41:54,083 --> 00:41:55,875
I'm okay! Let's hang out!

500
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,708
No, I can't today.
I'm waiting for Mama's call.

501
00:41:59,708 --> 00:42:04,875
Alright! I'll ask Len
if they wanna go to the mall.

502
00:42:04,936 --> 00:42:06,570
- Bye, sis!
- Bye, sis!

503
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,142
Sita! I need Sir to sign something.

504
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,667
But his door is locked.

505
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:05,900
And the blinds are drawn, too.
Looks like he's busy.

506
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:08,000
Okay. He must be taking a nap.

507
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:09,695
This can wait till tomorrow.

508
00:43:11,958 --> 00:43:13,167
I can't hear anything.

509
00:43:13,192 --> 00:43:14,775
- Yeah, maybe he took a nap.
- Alright.

510
00:44:21,176 --> 00:44:23,051
- Ma'am?
- Yes?

511
00:44:23,076 --> 00:44:24,826
May I use the restroom?

512
00:44:24,851 --> 00:44:26,642
I think my tummy's upset.

513
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:29,250
Huh? Want me to go with you?

514
00:44:29,542 --> 00:44:31,542
No, nevermind. I can manage.

515
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:32,750
Alright, you'd better go.

516
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:34,565
You don't want to make a mess in here.

517
00:45:40,417 --> 00:45:41,909
You're something else.

518
00:45:56,125 --> 00:45:57,708
What happened to you?

519
00:45:58,167 --> 00:45:59,167
Huh?

520
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,000
What happened to you?

521
00:46:01,667 --> 00:46:03,667
My tummy's all weird.

522
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:06,424
Ask for medicine at the clinic.

523
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:08,292
Thank you.

524
00:46:08,375 --> 00:46:09,542
I'm okay.

525
00:46:09,906 --> 00:46:11,088
Sure.

526
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:19,875
Beth?

527
00:46:21,333 --> 00:46:22,333
So?

528
00:46:22,417 --> 00:46:23,792
Are you feeling better?

529
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:26,208
I brought you medicine
and a glass of water.

530
00:46:27,617 --> 00:46:28,575
Thank you!

531
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:29,600
Thank you, Ana.

532
00:46:29,625 --> 00:46:31,276
I'll feel much better later.

533
00:46:31,500 --> 00:46:34,083
I'm glad I got in just in time!

534
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:38,208
If it doesn't improve tomorrow,
you should just skip class.

535
00:46:38,792 --> 00:46:40,792
Ana, I appreciate this.

536
00:46:41,083 --> 00:46:44,065
You're really my bestfriend.

537
00:46:52,934 --> 00:46:54,434
Another glass, Ma'am.

538
00:46:54,843 --> 00:46:56,093
Yes, please.

539
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,058
Love, I'm really sorry.

540
00:47:20,083 --> 00:47:21,750
My stomach's acting up.

541
00:47:22,234 --> 00:47:24,526
I thought the toilet bowl
has swallowed you up.

542
00:47:24,833 --> 00:47:26,159
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

543
00:47:29,885 --> 00:47:35,424
Sita is agitated because
Mike's running the office today.

544
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,820
I'll just put her at ease.

545
00:47:37,208 --> 00:47:37,958
Alright, sure.

546
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,692
Thanks Daddy! You're the best!

547
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:46,458
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

548
00:47:46,625 --> 00:47:48,542
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
I love you, I love you.

549
00:47:48,542 --> 00:47:50,440
I love you more, my Love.

550
00:47:52,833 --> 00:47:54,142
Happy Birthday!

551
00:47:54,167 --> 00:47:55,167
Thank you.

552
00:48:26,375 --> 00:48:28,167
What the hell, Carla!

553
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:31,333
So you just pop out of nowhere?!

554
00:48:32,958 --> 00:48:34,625
You bitch!

555
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:38,065
Hello! You gave me
your keys, remember?

556
00:48:38,253 --> 00:48:41,544
What, are you still having
those nightmares?

557
00:48:43,167 --> 00:48:46,125
These nightmares have clung
on to my life.

558
00:48:47,047 --> 00:48:50,380
But they're not as bad as they used to be.
I don't get them as often.

559
00:48:51,375 --> 00:48:53,042
Are you drinking your meds?

560
00:48:53,417 --> 00:48:56,362
You idiot! Do you think I'm a loonie?

561
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:57,892
I'm serious.

562
00:48:57,917 --> 00:48:59,833
I meant your anti-depressants.

563
00:49:01,208 --> 00:49:02,625
Of course!

564
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,500
You ask me as if you actually care!

565
00:49:09,292 --> 00:49:12,500
You know I worry about you.

566
00:49:12,625 --> 00:49:14,500
How's school?

567
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:16,417
It's okay.

568
00:49:16,442 --> 00:49:17,858
I like it better here.

569
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:23,208
It's quiet… I don't want
to go back to our old place!

570
00:49:25,292 --> 00:49:28,042
Well, expect that I'll visit you
from time to time.

571
00:49:28,375 --> 00:49:30,500
You don't even drop me messages anymore.

572
00:49:30,583 --> 00:49:33,308
That's why...
Ta-da! Surprise!

573
00:49:33,333 --> 00:49:34,333
I'm here!

574
00:49:34,358 --> 00:49:37,875
Right! You gave me such a fright!

575
00:49:38,333 --> 00:49:40,471
You almost killed me!

576
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:43,190
Oh, stop messing around!

577
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:44,875
But it's true…

578
00:49:44,917 --> 00:49:49,250
I really do worry about you.

579
00:51:45,917 --> 00:51:47,047
Hey, baby!

580
00:51:48,208 --> 00:51:49,875
I'm sorry. How was your day?

581
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,917
Wow! You're such a naughty girl!

582
00:51:59,042 --> 00:52:00,562
I'm driving!

583
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,523
What's wrong with you?

584
00:52:03,708 --> 00:52:07,844
Oops! Sorry… I just miss you.

585
00:52:09,458 --> 00:52:10,458
Okay, okay.

586
00:52:11,708 --> 00:52:16,167
Jeez… you got my little man
all wound up!

587
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:18,917
I should go. Bye!

588
00:52:22,292 --> 00:52:25,742
You're distracting me.
You silly girl.

589
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:41,250
She's taking forever! Who is it?

590
00:52:44,458 --> 00:52:46,414
I can't take it anymore!

591
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,558
My goodness, Beth! What the hell
were you doing in there?

592
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,792
You even locked the door!

593
00:52:52,817 --> 00:52:54,900
We're about to wet ourselves!

594
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:58,159
So sorry! I didn't notice
that I locked the door.

595
00:52:58,184 --> 00:53:00,142
I just got out of the cubicle.

596
00:53:00,167 --> 00:53:01,583
- Ugh!
- Sorry, girls!

597
00:53:01,608 --> 00:53:02,608
I can't take it anymore!

598
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,125
What's that?

599
00:53:14,708 --> 00:53:16,250
Medicine for my migraine.

600
00:53:17,917 --> 00:53:23,750
And I get bouts of depression whenever
I can't contact my parents.

601
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,208
I see…

602
00:53:27,792 --> 00:53:29,542
Good morning, class!

603
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:32,333
Good morning, ma'am!

604
00:53:32,583 --> 00:53:34,375
Okay, get 1/4 sheet of paper.

605
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:45,292
I want us to see each other.
Not just on video call. In person.

606
00:54:05,167 --> 00:54:07,875
We can't do that.

607
00:54:19,562 --> 00:54:21,088
What the hell...

608
00:54:46,375 --> 00:54:47,375
Shit.

609
00:55:17,292 --> 00:55:18,292
Shit.

610
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,492
Her business sounds like a lot of fun.

611
00:55:47,517 --> 00:55:48,975
I'll check out your shop.

612
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,542
Hello, sir!

613
00:55:52,458 --> 00:55:53,833
Oh, hey, Love!

614
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,792
Come, let's eat!

615
00:56:04,292 --> 00:56:06,000
Pa, how was your day?

616
00:56:06,042 --> 00:56:07,042
It's okay.

617
00:56:08,433 --> 00:56:11,061
I didn't know Beth
was such a clever girl

618
00:56:11,086 --> 00:56:13,183
and both her parents
are living abroad.

619
00:56:13,208 --> 00:56:16,116
She has her own online business!

620
00:56:16,141 --> 00:56:18,042
What was it you said
you were selling online?

621
00:56:18,067 --> 00:56:20,983
Oh no, I'm embarrassed
to say in front of Sir…

622
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,508
I'm selling undies.

623
00:56:25,963 --> 00:56:29,421
See, Ma'am, I told you.
It's embarrassing for Sir…

624
00:56:29,850 --> 00:56:34,517
Gosh, Beth, maybe you should
teach Ana a bit of what you do.

625
00:56:34,542 --> 00:56:37,542
So she doesn't waste
all her time on TikTok.

626
00:56:37,567 --> 00:56:39,108
Ma!

627
00:56:39,333 --> 00:56:40,333
No!

628
00:56:41,958 --> 00:56:43,708
What Beth is doing is hard work.

629
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:47,142
I want you to focus on your studies,
do you understand?

630
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:50,167
But Pa, I think it's exciting!

631
00:56:50,408 --> 00:56:51,825
You should teach me some time!

632
00:56:51,850 --> 00:56:54,142
Sure, I'll teach you some time.

633
00:56:54,167 --> 00:56:55,708
I know all about it!

634
00:56:58,708 --> 00:57:00,208
Are you feeling okay?

635
00:57:01,433 --> 00:57:03,850
It's probably just from work.

636
00:57:03,875 --> 00:57:05,125
Just tired from work.

637
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:06,875
Going back, Beth.

638
00:57:07,083 --> 00:57:10,583
We’d love to meet your parents someday.

639
00:57:10,625 --> 00:57:12,500
They raised you well.

640
00:57:12,625 --> 00:57:15,333
For sure, your mom
and I will get along very well.

641
00:57:15,458 --> 00:57:18,667
My parents aren't here
in the Philippines.

642
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:20,625
They're in Canada.

643
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:28,583
My Daddy's name is Virgilio Calderon,
and my mommy's name is Virginia.

644
00:57:31,292 --> 00:57:34,167
Are you okay?
You don't have a fever, though.

645
00:57:34,683 --> 00:57:38,433
I think my husband
just wants a cuddle.

646
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:42,083
Please, Ma! Not in front of my guest!

647
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,875
Get a room, you two!

648
00:57:46,918 --> 00:57:47,835
Oops!

649
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,172
Sorry!

650
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:50,617
I'm going to get it.

651
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:55,250
You okay?

652
00:57:55,792 --> 00:57:57,857
Yes, I'll just grab some pills
in the room.

653
00:57:58,091 --> 00:57:59,083
I gotcha!

654
00:57:59,083 --> 00:58:02,042
Alright, well, entertain your guest.

655
00:58:02,067 --> 00:58:04,401
I'll attend to your Dad.

656
00:58:04,625 --> 00:58:06,167
- Okay, Ma.
- Alright.

657
00:58:06,208 --> 00:58:07,667
Nanny Tasing!

658
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:12,365
They're sweet, aren't they?

659
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:16,125
I hope someday I'll find a man
just like my Papa.

660
00:58:16,583 --> 00:58:18,295
A man who loves his family.

661
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,250
Me, too, I hope…

662
00:59:36,583 --> 00:59:37,583
Love!

663
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,667
I'm going to get some water.

664
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:41,013
I can't sleep.

665
01:00:15,503 --> 01:00:16,904
What the fuck--

666
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:18,802
Beth?

667
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:20,708
What are you still doing here?

668
01:00:21,667 --> 01:00:23,740
Didn't Ana tell you?

669
01:00:24,750 --> 01:00:26,708
I'm sleeping over.

670
01:00:30,011 --> 01:00:31,136
What's that medicine for?

671
01:00:31,208 --> 01:00:32,375
Migraine.

672
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:37,333
What's your purpose?

673
01:00:37,856 --> 01:00:39,581
Do you want to break up my family?

674
01:00:39,708 --> 01:00:45,583
Do you want me to make a scene?

675
01:00:47,933 --> 01:00:48,933
What do you want?

676
01:00:48,958 --> 01:00:49,958
You!

677
01:00:55,375 --> 01:00:56,583
You're the one I want.

678
01:00:57,784 --> 01:00:59,367
Don't you want me, too?

679
01:01:01,542 --> 01:01:03,208
I'm your baby!

680
01:01:03,875 --> 01:01:05,404
Beth! Beth!

681
01:01:05,568 --> 01:01:06,958
What's wrong with you?

682
01:01:07,585 --> 01:01:09,960
Our relationship isn't even real!
It's all virtual!

683
01:01:10,042 --> 01:01:10,833
Come on!

684
01:01:10,858 --> 01:01:11,858
I love you!

685
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:13,417
Beth!

686
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,000
What's wrong with you?

687
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:17,500
Have you lost your mind?

688
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:20,356
You saw my wife, right?

689
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:22,392
You saw my daughter?

690
01:01:22,417 --> 01:01:24,131
You're even friends with her!

691
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,750
You know what…

692
01:01:27,318 --> 01:01:31,267
Okay, it was all my fault.
I am sorry.

693
01:01:31,292 --> 01:01:32,849
Let's just end this.

694
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:36,583
I recorded a video of every single time
you masturbated to me!

695
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:40,076
What would your precious family think

696
01:01:40,375 --> 01:01:42,381
when they find out

697
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,958
that goody goody ol' you

698
01:01:46,752 --> 01:01:49,201
is actually a pervert!

699
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:51,568
Don't you dare!

700
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,529
Don't you dare!

701
01:01:56,458 --> 01:01:58,333
You'll regret crossing me…

702
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:00,750
…Daddy!

703
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:23,400
Hi, Daddy! See you tonight!

704
01:02:23,424 --> 01:02:25,000
I'll text you which
hotel we're meeting at.

705
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:27,750
Don't worry, they won't notice
that I'm still a minor.

706
01:02:27,750 --> 01:02:32,943
What color would you like me to wear?
Red or black?

707
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:41,392
- Hello, Love.
- You have an emergency trip to Baguio?

708
01:02:41,417 --> 01:02:42,667
Take care, okay?

709
01:02:42,692 --> 01:02:44,292
I love you. Good luck!

710
01:02:44,317 --> 01:02:45,317
Thank you.

711
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:03,160
Sir?

712
01:03:04,083 --> 01:03:09,708
I already informed Ma'am Melba
that you have a meeting tonight in Baguio.

713
01:03:14,042 --> 01:03:15,042
In Baguio.

714
01:03:18,458 --> 01:03:19,458
Okay, Sir.

715
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,439
So you're going to Baguio, Daddy!

716
01:03:40,463 --> 01:03:42,623
Ana messaged me,
she's inviting me to your house.

717
01:03:44,292 --> 01:03:49,083
If they only knew we'll just be
somewhere nearby. See you soon!

718
01:03:58,752 --> 01:04:00,335
This is what you want.

719
01:04:00,625 --> 01:04:03,667
Alright, I'll play.

720
01:04:03,692 --> 01:04:06,568
Until you'll be the one
begging me to stop.

721
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,958
What took you so long?

722
01:04:31,458 --> 01:04:34,000
Come, let's have something to eat first.

723
01:04:35,708 --> 01:04:37,310
If I'm hungry,

724
01:04:37,583 --> 01:04:39,208
I'll go home to my wife.

725
01:04:40,625 --> 01:04:41,625
Cheers.

726
01:08:07,958 --> 01:08:12,000
See you later...

727
01:09:32,792 --> 01:09:35,192
Hi, Virgilio! This is Conrado,
the dad of Ana,

728
01:09:35,216 --> 01:09:37,458
Beth's classmate and
good friend in school.

729
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:39,840
Would you mind
if I extend my hand

730
01:09:39,864 --> 01:09:42,208
of friendship to
you and your family?

731
01:09:42,233 --> 01:09:45,570
Let me know if I can call you?
Best Regards!

732
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:15,500
I don't mind this setup as long
as we're together every 15th and 30th.

733
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:35,333
You want to do it here.

734
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:06,500
Answer me. Are you ignoring me?

735
01:14:16,458 --> 01:14:19,833
Sorry, just a little busy.
My business is having problems.

736
01:14:27,065 --> 01:14:29,861
Hey, why aren't you asleep yet?

737
01:14:30,339 --> 01:14:31,854
Sita is messaging.

738
01:14:32,511 --> 01:14:33,721
So annoying.

739
01:14:35,179 --> 01:14:37,017
Tell them goodnight.

740
01:14:47,906 --> 01:14:51,487
I really enjoyed Father's homily
this afternoon.

741
01:14:51,958 --> 01:14:56,628
Two wrongs don't make a right.

742
01:14:58,167 --> 01:14:59,458
Where'd Ana disappear to?

743
01:14:59,583 --> 01:15:01,250
She came home late again, I bet?

744
01:15:01,275 --> 01:15:03,900
Oh, didn't she mention
she and Beth are hanging out today?

745
01:15:07,708 --> 01:15:10,173
Don't want to meet with me?
I'm with a friend right now.

746
01:15:10,198 --> 01:15:12,875
Maybe I should
tell her about us.

747
01:15:16,475 --> 01:15:20,829
Ah, Love. I just have to deal
with a client. It's an emergency!

748
01:15:20,854 --> 01:15:22,975
It's an emergency.
I just need to deal with this.

749
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:25,750
Go on home.
I'll call you right away.

750
01:15:25,775 --> 01:15:26,692
I'll be home as soon as I can!

751
01:15:26,875 --> 01:15:27,875
What?

752
01:15:39,198 --> 01:15:43,659
Beth! Don't try anything stupid
or I'll kill you!

753
01:15:43,917 --> 01:15:45,208
You'd better behave!

754
01:16:03,542 --> 01:16:04,542
Move it!

755
01:16:10,750 --> 01:16:12,042
Beth! Beth.

756
01:16:16,375 --> 01:16:17,792
Ah, you're here.

757
01:16:21,017 --> 01:16:22,808
Beth, what the hell,
where's my daughter?

758
01:16:22,833 --> 01:16:24,276
I'd like you to meet Carla.

759
01:16:24,503 --> 01:16:25,750
My friend.

760
01:16:30,225 --> 01:16:32,642
She's the one
I was telling you about.

761
01:16:32,667 --> 01:16:33,979
Hello!

762
01:16:34,378 --> 01:16:37,901
So it's true...
You're very attractive.

763
01:16:40,975 --> 01:16:43,433
Beth. What are you playing at?

764
01:16:43,766 --> 01:16:44,975
It's nothing!

765
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:46,792
I just thought of changing
things up a little bit.

766
01:16:46,956 --> 01:16:49,914
I thought maybe you were getting tired
of just the two of us.

767
01:16:49,914 --> 01:16:52,331
So invited a third person.

768
01:16:52,331 --> 01:16:56,497
After all, this has always
been one of your desires, right?

769
01:16:57,247 --> 01:16:58,456
To be in a threesome.

770
01:16:58,456 --> 01:17:00,917
I think it's too much
for him to take in.

771
01:17:11,997 --> 01:17:17,081
Promise… if you let
my friend join us this time,

772
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:22,331
I swear I'll never bother you again.
You'll be a free man.

773
01:19:46,372 --> 01:19:49,456
You men are all the same!

774
01:19:50,122 --> 01:19:57,081
You're a bunch of animals!
Opportunists! All you do is take!

775
01:19:58,968 --> 01:20:01,942
Beth, don't kill me!

776
01:20:01,967 --> 01:20:06,039
Of course not! Why would I kill you?

777
01:20:26,372 --> 01:20:27,664
What a waste…

778
01:20:28,781 --> 01:20:30,539
I did love you.

779
01:20:32,844 --> 01:20:34,581
I thought you were the one.

780
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:40,622
But I was right, wasn't I?
This is the last time we'll see each other.

781
01:21:13,664 --> 01:21:15,372
Papa, please, enough...

782
01:21:16,247 --> 01:21:18,247
This is what true love looks like!

783
01:23:17,792 --> 01:23:18,792
Hello!

784
01:23:22,344 --> 01:23:24,398
Hello!
