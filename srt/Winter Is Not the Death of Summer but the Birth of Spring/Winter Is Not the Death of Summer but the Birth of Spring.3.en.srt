He said he lives in Sathon. Is it the same Sathon I know?

37
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,800
He doesn't buy any services.

183
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,080
Share with me too.

184
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,040
My hands are busy, feed me then.

185
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,800
Hey.

186
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:39,960
What's that?

187
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,120
It's done.

188
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,960
Is it okay?

189
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,320
It's good.

190
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,400
Very nice.

191
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,080
Did you do it by yourself?

192
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,800
Yes, I did.

193
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,840
I’ll quickly use the card and pay you.

194
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,800
- Okay?
- No need to hurry. You can pay me later.

195
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,680
If I want something from you, I'll tell you later.

196
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,600
Okay.

197
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:21,600
Jed.

198
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:33,320
Do you have feelings for Bible?

199
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:00,560
Then...

200
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,280
Why do you like him?

201
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,840
I might be asking you too directly.

202
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,400
But are you sure that...

203
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,120
You won't be sad because of him?

204
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,880
I'm just worried about you.

205
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,000
That's true, he's my friend.

206
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,000
But you have been kind to me as well.

207
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,920
It would be great if you... brace yourself.

208
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:07,920
I know you're serious about him.

209
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,280
If you have feelings for him, why don't you tell him?

210
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,720
Gosh.

211
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,360
What’s with the act?

212
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,840
If there's a thing that make you happy in here,

213
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,040
You just do it.

214
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,760
I’m gonna go now.

215
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,840
I’ll go read comics as well.

216
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,320
Jed, actually I just...

217
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:10,960
Nothing.

218
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:48,560
[There is no rejection more cruel than the denial of yourself.]

219
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:11,920
Hey.

220
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,480
Can you read this out for me?

221
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,480
Your handwriting is so awful that I can't read.

222
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:22,960
Read it out for me.

223
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,080
Do you really want me to read it out?

224
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,640
You think I'm joking?

225
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:04,520
Just read it.

226
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:13,920
Jed.

227
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:16,520
You also can't read your handwriting.

228
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,120
I can read it, but...

229
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,480
Read it out.

230
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:34,120
'I don't know how you'll feel when you receive this letter,

231
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,520
But...

232
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,280
If it makes you uncomfortable,

233
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,720
I'm really sorry.

234
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,840
But we can just be friends.'

235
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,920
I just want to get to know you more.

236
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,280
Well...

237
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,400
I don't want you to be afraid of me.

238
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,640
Be friends, right?

239
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,680
How many papers to fold today?

240
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,280
How many left?

241
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:41,560
Wait a sec.
