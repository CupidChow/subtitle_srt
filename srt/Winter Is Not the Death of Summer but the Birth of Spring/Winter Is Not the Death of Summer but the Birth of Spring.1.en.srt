Move up.

187
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:52,264
Hey!

188
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,057
Head to the room.

189
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:56,935
Stand up.

190
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,729
Have you cleaned the toilet yet?

191
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,219
[Block 1]

192
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,550
Hey.

193
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:52,676
Shut up.

194
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:53,552
I can't sleep.

195
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,358
Who is Pathomkarn Siri?

196
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:13,655
It's me.

197
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,199
Follow me.

198
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:17,158
Stand up.

199
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,077
Your family has come to bail you out.

200
00:26:19,828 --> 00:26:21,037
Hey, wait!

201
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:22,455
Are you leaving?

202
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:24,708
Come here.

203
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:26,710
Keep quite, you guys.

204
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:34,926
I'm here.

205
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,052
Just follow me.

206
00:26:36,678 --> 00:26:37,846
Your family has come.

207
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:39,848
- Really?
- You can go home.

208
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:40,974
Thank you so much.

209
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:42,350
Thank you.

210
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,687
Hey, go to sleep!

211
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:11,921
You are free now.

212
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:13,715
Glad for you.

213
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,009
And...

214
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:18,386
Don't come back here again.

215
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:19,763
Get it?

216
00:27:43,161 --> 00:27:44,120
It's said that

217
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,456
when you get out of prison,

218
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:50,085
you should never look back, or you'll end up coming back.

219
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,253
Do I believe that?

220
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:53,380
Yes, I do.

221
00:27:54,798 --> 00:27:56,591
But I don't know why I do like that.

222
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,736
I want to say thank you to him.

223
00:28:17,445 --> 00:28:18,154
At least,

224
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,324
I can smile while I'm here.

225
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,705
There's nothing that made me smile in here but him.

226
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,897
Thank you, Bible.

227
00:28:54,691 --> 00:28:56,693
Someday, we'll meet each other somewhere.

228
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:59,112
Somewhere that's not here.
