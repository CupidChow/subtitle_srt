1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:11,000
"Go ahead and kiss."

2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Hey

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Bro, how’s it going? Have you told the relatives about me yet?

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,500
Hey

5
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,280
Thanks, Bro.

6
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,912
It’s okay.

7
00:00:53,912 --> 00:00:56,560
So, who came to visit?

8
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,560
Mom and younger brother

9
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:02,040
Wow, you should get ready to cleanse your stomach tomorrow.

10
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:03,600
That's exaggerated.

11
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:04,919
So, what’s going on in the cafeteria?

12
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:12,800
Don’t you know? Today, Non and View just got married.

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:13,592
What ?

14
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,914
Well, they had a wedding. Non gave his wife the order to send food to those inside. Confused

15
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,080
huh?

16
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:25,440
Confused, huh?

17
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:33,920
Well, he didn’t say it was a wedding. he just said they were bringing food for the people inside, not that he was feeding the new wife inside.

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,400
Is this really a thing?

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,160
Go get some to eat.

20
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:40,930
It's fine, I'd rather not.

21
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,375
I’m going to throw the flower now.

22
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:48,680
3 2 1

23
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,560
Alright, this is definitely the next person.

24
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,280
I know you’re feeling uneasy,

25
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,200
I know there are so many who see you wrongly.

26
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,280
The things you think, no one notices or understands.

27
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:55,480
Even if others are the way they are,

28
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:02,440
Even if no one gives you a chance,

29
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:11,440
On the days you fail, the days you make mistakes,

30
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:21,920
No matter the day, I just want you to know.

31
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:36,080
Even if no one loves you, even if no one cares,

32
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:53,040
I want you to hold on and not be shaken.
Even if all the stars disappear from the sky,
Even if people don’t understand you,

33
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:04,720
Can you just keep this in mind?
That I love you.
Hey, listen up. No free rides, okay?

34
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,520
Come here

35
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,779
quick.

36
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,160
What do I have to pay with?

37
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Oh, here we go again.

38
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:07,160
Always twisting things, huh? Such a troublemaker.

39
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,640
Don’t you like it, though?

40
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:21,720
So, what’s wrong?

41
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,360
Nothing.

42
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
Come on, spill it. What’s up?

43
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,040
Haven’t gotten a letter in ages. Don’t know if everything’s okay back home.

44
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,560
Maybe next time I visit my relatives, I will ask my mom call them ?

45
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,440
No, it’s fine.

46
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:52,120
I can . Want me to?

47
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,040
You sure? Okay, thank you.

48
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:02,360
Don’t overthink it. It’s nothing serious.

49
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,840
I’ll try my best.

50
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,440
By the way, you played so well earlier! I was watching.

51
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,588
Practice makes perfect, right?

52
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,080
You’re really good at this!

53
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,760
Well, practice is the key.

54
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,761
Seriously, though.

55
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:20,761
Yeah, really

56
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:28,760
Honestly, before I end up in jail, I kinda want to audition for The Voice.

57
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:37,240
What’s so funny?!

58
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:39,240
Sorry!

59
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,292
Damn, you were just complimenting me a second ago.

60
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,080
What, you want a punch in the face?

61
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,920
Just picturing your face when the coach turns around—it’d be hilarious!

62
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:56,889
I’ll smack you.

63
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:01,880
Come on, show me the face you’d make if they turned around.

64
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:07,480
All four of them turn around

65
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,732
what then?

66
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:17,237
Oh man, that’s so funny.

67
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,840
I am the coolest one on the show.

68
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,340
You’re seriously cracking me up.

69
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,560
Alright, keep it up and I’ll smack you for real.

70
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,840
Do you really want to go on The Voice?

71
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,560
Why don’t we do something fun to kill time?

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,880
Like what?

73
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,320
Not telling you!

74
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,560
What are you planning?

75
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,713
You’ll see.

76
00:09:03,713 --> 00:09:05,276
Do you really want to go?

77
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,880
tell me , or let me hit you with the guitar,

78
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,159
Hit me then you’re not going anywhere!

79
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,120
It’s fine the way it is.

80
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,960
Did you really graduate from college with writing like this?

81
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:11,960
Oh man, it’s like I’m just scribbling things down!

82
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,460
Why don’t you write it for me?

83
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,720
What if I can’t draw straight lines? What do I do then?

84
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,200
Just draw the lines for me.

85
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,822
Just go ahead and draw them.

86
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,480
Why do I have to draw lines while you only do for that for bible ?

87
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,920
Draw the lines straight, not like this!
How many forms do I have to write, seriously?
Hurry up!

88
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,880
The central office said the senior officials haven’t issued the approval letter yet.

89
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,960
So when will I know, then?

90
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:30,440
We can’t rush them. We just have to wait until they respond. For now, that’s it.
Alright.

91
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,440
Hey, how’s it going?

92
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
Not great

93
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,640
So, are we even going to get approval to proceed?

94
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:54,160
Maybe we should just start announcing applications now. What do you think?

95
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:48,880
That’s it. That’s all. It’s done

96
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:18,780
Bro

97
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,280
You’re not afraid of getting scolded for bringing the guitar?

98
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,120
Been there, done that.

99
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,120
This is nothing.

100
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,040
Is this the song I have to play?

101
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,040
Umm...

102
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,760
Let me see.

103
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,040
Whoa, damn! Whoa, there’s rap in here too, damn it.

104
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,080
How good do I have to be to pull this off perfectly?

105
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:05,440
Bro you’re really setting yourself up, aren’t you? Making yourself tired for no reason.

106
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,240
Not tired at all. It’s fun! Better than just sitting around doing nothing

107
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,160
You’ll go back home soon anyway, won’t you?

108
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,200
Coming in late but getting to rest first, huh?

109
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:57,880
Hey, bro , I’ve known this song for ages. Can you sing it?

110
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,440
I should remember it. Let’s give it a shot

111
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,680
I know well that you’re cruel,

112
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,240
But I can’t help but accept it.

113
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,240
I know you’ll break your promises,

114
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:37,880
But I love you, though I don’t know why.

115
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Just a glance into your eyes,

116
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:49,360
And my heart drifts away.

117
00:16:49,360 --> 00:17:00,960
This heart never learns,
It seems to revel in being hurt again and again.

118
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,760
This heart is so foolish,

119
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,240
It never listens to warnings.

120
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,240
As if being hurt wasn’t enough,

121
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,240
It willingly chooses to endure the pain.

122
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,840
This cursed heart of mine,

123
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:30,480
Keeps hurting itself endlessly.

124
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:11,560
Bro, you’re actually singing it, huh?
Really?

125
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,840
What’s wrong? Are you sick?

126
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:02,480
Not sick, I just have something I need your help with.

127
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,960
What do you need help with?
Heh.

128
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:20,720
Well, we’re organizing a singing competition, The Voice, in the camp, but the permission letter hasn’t come through yet.

129
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:27,280
When’s the event? I’ll speed things up for you.

130
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,799
Why do you always make things hard for yourself? Always looking for something to do

131
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:51,760
Because we’ve got nothing else to do, and I want to give people in the camp something to keep themselves entertained.

132
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:58,760
Jed, you don’t always have to think about others. Focus on yourself first.

133
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:10,000
Well, that’s exactly what I’m doing. I’m bored, so I want to do something to fight the boredom. Get it?

134
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:34,600
If I say I’ll help, it’s not just for free. You’ll have to work in the clinic with me.
What do you say?

135
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,680
And what if I say I’m not coming?

136
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,720
Are we done here? I’ve got other patients to check on.

137
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:18,400
Attention everyone, listen up!
Many of you have been asking me when the next family visitation will be.

138
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Why hasn’t there been any announcement yet?

139
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,320
Today, the decision has been finalized.

140
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:31,680
The next family visitation has been postponed indefinitely.
What about letters?

141
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:35,089
Are they not allowing family visits anymore?

142
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:36,080
It’s been postponed indefinitely.

143
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,080
Indefinitely? Really?

144
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,560
If I find out anything, I’ll let you know.

145
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,720
Indefinitely? Really?

146
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:45,720
If I find out anything, I’ll let you know.

147
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:49,920
As for letters, there will be some delays.

148
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:58,440
Every letter must go through a disinfection process because the virus outbreak outside is severe right now.

149
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,200
You know, we’re better off than people outside.

150
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:13,200
So, for anyone asking me when the next family visitation will be,

151
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
the answer is: it has been postponed indefinitely.

152
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,720
Next up is you come here.

153
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,220
What song will you be singing?

154
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,220
I’d like to change the song.

155
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,960
Oh? Did you think of one beforehand?

156
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:57,400
You didn’t? What should we do now?

157
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,320
Patomkarn Siri, come to the front of the camp, right now, immediately!

158
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:14,120
Alright then, think of a song first, and we’ll move on to the next person.

159
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:16,720
Hey, don’t pick a song that’ll make things hard for the musicians, alright?

160
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,000
What? Boss,

161
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,000
You want me to make an MV and broadcast it to every prison?

162
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:33,880
Uh, yes. At the end of this year, the central office just held a meeting. Each prison is required to submit a project created by the inmates for the New Year’s celebration.

163
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
What about the camera and editing and all that?

164
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:55,480
Your job is to come up with the concept and make the MV. Don’t worry, the prison will provide you with a full team.

165
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,400
But the camp is organizing The Voice singing contest right now. Will we have enough time?

166
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:25,480
Let me tell you this. The warden said if you agree to do the MV, the singing contest can start immediately—from now. I think this is right up your alley; it’s just making an MV.

167
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,480
Really?

168
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,480
Really.

169
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,320
So, I can start now?

170
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:33,240
Yes, start right now.

171
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,240
You like doing this kind of thing, don’t you?

172
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:49,740
Bible

173
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,200
can you be an actor in the MV for me?

174
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:02,400
They said if you do the MV, they’ll approve the singing contest.

175
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,560
Uh… Sure, I’ll do it.

176
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,560
Really? You said it now

177
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:57,280
Cut! Are we done yet, bro? I’m freezing out here!

178
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,780
Cut

179
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,480
Why do we even have this scene, uncle?

180
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,960
Are you keeping it to watch privately?

181
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:05,960
I have no idea.

182
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,960
Guess we’ll have to wait and see the full version.

183
00:29:11,909 --> 00:29:13,812
Look at this.

184
00:29:13,812 --> 00:29:14,704
Don't watch it

185
00:29:14,704 --> 00:29:16,085
Look at your own work.

186
00:29:16,565 --> 00:29:18,565
Look up

187
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,572
What are you embarrassed about?

188
00:29:20,572 --> 00:29:22,572
Oops!

189
00:29:52,965 --> 00:29:54,965
I would like to tell my fellow inmates that

190
00:29:56,191 --> 00:29:58,044
When we are inside

191
00:29:58,907 --> 00:30:00,907
It seems like each day is going by slowly.

192
00:30:02,504 --> 00:30:04,210
Many times I think that

193
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,023
If I could go back and fix the mistakes I made,

194
00:30:08,025 --> 00:30:10,025
What will I do today?

195
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,200
But I thought that

196
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:15,918
It's a story of the past.

197
00:30:16,335 --> 00:30:17,943
I guess there's nothing I can do to fix it.

198
00:30:19,736 --> 00:30:21,491
What I can fix is

199
00:30:23,186 --> 00:30:25,186
My day today

200
00:30:25,706 --> 00:30:27,706
Today and from now on

201
00:30:29,107 --> 00:30:31,107
I will try to be a better person every day.

202
00:30:32,949 --> 00:30:34,215
Be a new person

203
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:37,029
Be someone I will like myself every day.

204
00:35:03,537 --> 00:35:04,883
So many fans, huh?

205
00:35:05,849 --> 00:35:06,967
Of course!

206
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,212
Can I have it?

207
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,464
You’re asking for it, really?

208
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,766
Can I?

209
00:35:12,766 --> 00:35:13,481
Here you go.

210
00:35:13,481 --> 00:35:14,464
I don’t like eating this.

211
00:35:17,224 --> 00:35:18,373
Can I have it all?

212
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:20,120
You want it all?

213
00:35:20,778 --> 00:35:21,436
Uh…

214
00:35:21,668 --> 00:35:22,168
Can I?

215
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,054
Don’t you have money?

216
00:35:25,169 --> 00:35:26,284
But I really want this one.

217
00:35:26,284 --> 00:35:29,093
Hey, hey, calm down, big boss!

218
00:35:29,593 --> 00:35:30,840
Here you go.

219
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,145
You can’t even give me this much?

220
00:35:41,185 --> 00:35:42,817
Congrats to the Hero

221
00:35:50,769 --> 00:35:51,474
Sis

222
00:35:52,257 --> 00:35:53,201
you're good too

223
00:35:54,342 --> 00:35:55,469
Making someone

224
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,899
forget what a piece of crap they used to be

225
00:36:05,951 --> 00:36:07,829
Just by starring in one music video

226
00:36:08,097 --> 00:36:08,865
everyone's flocking to them

227
00:36:11,164 --> 00:36:16,039
Is this what they call 'washing away sins'?

228
00:36:17,286 --> 00:36:18,533
The entertainment industry, right?

229
00:36:21,945 --> 00:36:22,834
But now

230
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:25,750
they're an icon for all the lowlifes

231
00:36:26,955 --> 00:36:28,375
an idol for all the crappy people

232
00:36:31,356 --> 00:36:32,673
You must be so proud

233
00:36:34,583 --> 00:36:35,680
huh?

234
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:46,554
Your life is already a mess

235
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:49,706
don’t make it any worse

236
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,243
Honestly

237
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:54,960
don’t you ever feel sorry for yourself?

238
00:36:59,179 --> 00:37:00,660
But probably not

239
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:05,103
If you did

240
00:37:06,604 --> 00:37:08,644
you wouldn’t keep doing crappy things

241
00:37:09,449 --> 00:37:10,950
or saying crappy stuff

242
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:13,402
like this

243
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:15,700
But it’s okay

244
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,696
It’s fine

245
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:19,876
I really get it

246
00:37:20,849 --> 00:37:21,822
truly

247
00:37:23,318 --> 00:37:24,507
Because we’re all

248
00:37:25,742 --> 00:37:27,432
crappy too

249
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,579
right?

250
00:37:32,425 --> 00:37:33,006
Go on then

251
00:38:04,545 --> 00:38:06,709
If it weren’t for the fact that you’re my brother’s ex

252
00:38:07,383 --> 00:38:08,916
I’d have dealt with you a long time ago, you piece of crap

253
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:44,065
Bible, what’s wrong?

254
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:45,285
Bible

255
00:38:46,299 --> 00:38:46,991
what’s wrong?

256
00:38:47,639 --> 00:38:48,287
Bro

257
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,407
what

258
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:54,880
Hey, what’s wrong?

259
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,000
Thank you.

260
00:39:01,557 --> 00:39:03,114
Thank you too. What’s wrong?

261
00:39:03,614 --> 00:39:04,612
You made

262
00:39:06,115 --> 00:39:07,769
me realize that even someone

263
00:39:07,769 --> 00:39:09,482
as messed up as me can do something good

264
00:39:12,036 --> 00:39:12,979
It’s okay It’s okay

265
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:15,680
Whatever happened in the past

266
00:39:17,988 --> 00:39:19,550
just let it go. Start over

267
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,080
give yourself a chance

268
00:39:24,806 --> 00:39:26,814
Let’s start forward together

269
00:39:27,974 --> 00:39:29,134
okay?

270
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,513
Takes so long

271
00:39:47,513 --> 00:39:48,547
should I even bother waiting?

272
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:17,950
Move your foot!

273
00:40:25,227 --> 00:40:26,062
Sis

274
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:28,263
wait!

275
00:40:28,827 --> 00:40:30,000
I need to talk to you about something

276
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:32,072
Sit down

277
00:40:35,238 --> 00:40:35,935
sit down!

278
00:40:36,729 --> 00:40:37,845
I’ve got something to discuss

279
00:40:48,684 --> 00:40:49,652
So

280
00:40:50,963 --> 00:40:52,274
um… that music video was awesome

281
00:40:53,896 --> 00:40:54,927
Hey, when I get out

282
00:40:55,624 --> 00:40:56,965
let me work with you too, okay?

283
00:40:58,227 --> 00:40:58,952
Actually

284
00:40:58,952 --> 00:41:00,480
I once auditioned

285
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:00,980
for

286
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:02,768
BL series roles

287
00:41:03,567 --> 00:41:05,171
but they didn’t accept me because I act too feminine

288
00:41:05,925 --> 00:41:07,270
So I always got rejected

289
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,289
Sorry

290
00:41:09,557 --> 00:41:10,970
I don’t know how I ended up talking about that

291
00:41:12,144 --> 00:41:13,318
Anyway let me get to the point

292
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,255
It’s about Bible

293
00:41:17,243 --> 00:41:17,980
I

294
00:41:18,463 --> 00:41:20,036
used to date him

295
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:22,020
When we were together

296
00:41:23,685 --> 00:41:24,507
I

297
00:41:25,473 --> 00:41:27,100
had to feed him all the time

298
00:41:28,282 --> 00:41:28,927
basically

299
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,715
I was taking care of him like a boyfriend I had to support

300
00:41:32,888 --> 00:41:33,685
Oh

301
00:41:34,185 --> 00:41:34,953
and

302
00:41:35,346 --> 00:41:35,846
he’s

303
00:41:37,064 --> 00:41:38,047
really horny too

304
00:41:38,705 --> 00:41:39,363
I just

305
00:41:40,105 --> 00:41:40,847
couldn’t deal with it

306
00:41:43,177 --> 00:41:44,219
But I think you, Sis

307
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:47,041
might be able to handle him

308
00:41:52,256 --> 00:41:54,464
I’m telling you this because I care

309
00:41:55,349 --> 00:41:56,717
We’re the same kind right?

310
00:41:57,217 --> 00:41:58,737
What I went through

311
00:41:59,394 --> 00:42:01,200
I don’t want you to go through too

312
00:42:02,188 --> 00:42:03,176
So

313
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:06,456
just think about it

314
00:42:08,663 --> 00:42:09,680
Hey Sis

315
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:21,666
View!

316
00:42:23,493 --> 00:42:24,676
What the hell are you doing?

317
00:42:31,929 --> 00:42:33,143
Um, Sis

318
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,681
for the second music video,

319
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:36,819
let me be the lead actress

320
00:42:38,775 --> 00:42:39,758
And

321
00:42:41,047 --> 00:42:42,503
I’ll pick my own leading man

322
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,563
Is it okay?

323
00:45:43,992 --> 00:45:45,225
You don’t usually cry, do you?

324
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:51,873
The last time I cried was in grade 2

325
00:45:52,302 --> 00:45:53,589
when Aunt didn’t buy me a game.

326
00:46:11,355 --> 00:46:11,996
Bible

327
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,132
get through this

328
00:46:18,968 --> 00:46:19,891
You can do it.

329
00:46:25,834 --> 00:46:27,267
We’ll get through this together.

330
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:08,410
Does it hurt, Sis?

331
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,730
No

332
00:47:29,253 --> 00:47:30,301
Does it hurt, Sis?

333
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:31,311
What happened to you?

334
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:32,401
doesn't hurt

335
00:47:33,566 --> 00:47:36,288
Probably when I was eating bread

336
00:47:42,794 --> 00:47:45,000
Ugh, stop lying, stop lying.

337
00:48:01,427 --> 00:48:03,735
What the hell, Sis?

338
00:48:04,003 --> 00:48:04,771
Get out!

339
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:06,076
I’m putting on ointment here

340
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:07,969
damn it, always like this

341
00:48:21,085 --> 00:48:24,323
Does it hurt, Sis?

342
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:31,533
Does it hurt, Sis?

343
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:32,836
It hurts so much, yeah

344
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:36,338
Sis, stop lying

345
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,320
After this, pack up your stuff

346
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:02,430
because you’re going to have to stay in dan2

347
00:49:03,049 --> 00:49:04,527
for quarantine before you can come back in.

348
00:49:05,094 --> 00:49:05,661
Wait

349
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:09,373
isn’t my case done already? I’m about to get parole, right?

350
00:49:11,512 --> 00:49:12,470
I’m not sure

351
00:49:13,328 --> 00:49:14,777
You’ll find out at court.

352
00:49:16,731 --> 00:49:17,933
By the way

353
00:49:20,017 --> 00:49:21,400
I heard something

354
00:49:22,623 --> 00:49:23,846
Your friend, the one named Hawk

355
00:49:25,428 --> 00:49:26,473
who was your co-defendant

356
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:28,743
he went to court the other day

357
00:49:30,508 --> 00:49:32,595
On his way back...

358
00:49:34,414 --> 00:49:35,343
While he

359
00:49:35,773 --> 00:49:37,092
was in the car, he was hit by a truck.

360
00:49:46,594 --> 00:49:47,470
And?

361
00:49:54,913 --> 00:49:55,860
He Died

362
00:50:00,363 --> 00:50:02,074
I find it strange though, Bible

363
00:50:04,113 --> 00:50:05,417
When you go out

364
00:50:06,608 --> 00:50:07,799
be careful

365
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:14,535
alright?
Okay, go ahead, start packing your stuff

366
00:50:24,469 --> 00:50:28,229
Bird, hurry up, we need to get to the other side soon

367
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:45,405
I’ll go pack my stuff first

368
00:51:13,053 --> 00:51:13,997
He’s tough

369
00:51:14,974 --> 00:51:15,951
he’ll come back

370
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:17,580
Trust me

371
00:55:01,071 --> 00:55:01,719
Bro,

372
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:08,601
What’s up?

373
00:55:21,873 --> 00:55:22,422
What’s wrong?

374
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,066
What’s up?

375
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:45,897
The car that Bible was in on the way to court

376
00:55:47,897 --> 00:55:48,931
Why

377
00:55:54,541 --> 00:55:55,473
got hit.

378
00:58:47,856 --> 00:58:49,142
I’ll pick you up tomorrow

379
00:58:52,627 --> 00:58:53,374
Thank you.

380
00:58:57,776 --> 00:59:00,621
Do you really believe that people in prison can love each other?

381
00:59:03,897 --> 00:59:05,079
I don’t really believe it

382
00:59:06,933 --> 00:59:07,664
I just know

383
00:59:08,577 --> 00:59:09,748
that people on the outside

384
00:59:11,305 --> 00:59:12,857
aren’t that different from those on the inside.

385
00:59:13,502 --> 00:59:14,403
Do you think the same?

386
00:59:58,642 --> 00:59:59,640
Bible

387
01:00:01,096 --> 01:00:02,354
I am here

388
01:00:11,426 --> 01:00:12,338
Get well soon

389
01:01:13,485 --> 01:01:15,000
How did you get here, Jed?

390
01:01:16,162 --> 01:01:17,324
Big connections

391
01:01:19,627 --> 01:01:21,340
Yeah, yeah, big connections.

392
01:01:24,912 --> 01:01:26,229
Does it hurt anywhere?

393
01:01:27,242 --> 01:01:28,631
No need for the doctor to check

394
01:01:39,808 --> 01:01:43,147
I’ll check for you

395
01:01:49,449 --> 01:01:51,517
Oh, Jed

396
01:01:52,017 --> 01:01:52,732
don’t be so rough

397
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,983
Don’t move too much

398
01:01:53,983 --> 01:01:54,483
damn it hurts.

399
01:02:18,009 --> 01:02:18,719
Want more?

400
01:02:21,215 --> 01:02:21,832
I’m full, Jed

401
01:02:22,548 --> 01:02:23,264
You eat it yourself.

402
01:02:23,264 --> 01:02:23,979
How about a little more?

403
01:02:24,247 --> 01:02:24,747
No, I’m good

404
01:02:25,966 --> 01:02:26,702
Just eat it.

405
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:31,468
Then, how about some orange?

406
01:03:02,361 --> 01:03:02,861
Hey,

407
01:03:04,364 --> 01:03:05,524
you said you’d peel it for me

408
01:03:07,027 --> 01:03:08,480
but now you’re eating it yourself

409
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,271
I’m just tasting it first to see if it’s sweet.

410
01:03:15,301 --> 01:03:16,378
Is it sweet, ?

411
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:13,310
Want more?

412
01:04:15,851 --> 01:04:16,834
That’s enough

413
01:04:19,357 --> 01:04:20,600
Don’t move up and down,

414
01:04:21,835 --> 01:04:23,133
it still hurts.

415
01:04:25,544 --> 01:04:26,720
You thought you’d be fine?

416
01:04:28,516 --> 01:04:29,614
Don’t challenge me.

417
01:04:37,664 --> 01:04:38,803
That’s enough,

418
01:04:40,092 --> 01:04:41,258
I don’t want more.

419
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:43,779
How are you feeling?

420
01:04:54,919 --> 01:04:56,235
How’s the pain?

421
01:04:57,123 --> 01:04:59,246
I have a bit of a headache and some body aches, doctor.

422
01:05:01,126 --> 01:05:03,006
From what I can see, the X-ray results look normal

423
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:06,924
The bone isn’t broken, and there are no fractures inside

424
01:05:16,472 --> 01:05:18,450
Let me talk to the patient for a moment

425
01:05:39,076 --> 01:05:39,847
Jed and I

426
01:05:41,189 --> 01:05:43,360
have been together since university

427
01:05:46,472 --> 01:05:48,242
but we’ve known each other since high school

428
01:05:50,381 --> 01:05:51,393
We loved each other so much

429
01:05:52,863 --> 01:05:54,333
But we broke up

430
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,560
because he found out I was seeing someone else

431
01:06:00,691 --> 01:06:01,406
Do you know

432
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:03,800
that I’ve always felt guilty toward him?

433
01:06:05,216 --> 01:06:06,417
He’s such a good person

434
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:08,779
and he deserves to meet someone

435
01:06:09,209 --> 01:06:10,804
who will truly love and be sincere with him

436
01:06:11,730 --> 01:06:13,085
Do you think you can do that?

437
01:06:14,789 --> 01:06:15,580
Huh?

438
01:06:59,255 --> 01:06:59,974
Bible

439
01:07:01,262 --> 01:07:02,159
what did he say to you just now?

440
01:07:02,642 --> 01:07:04,006
Don’t listen to him.

441
01:07:16,293 --> 01:07:17,682
Why aren’t you saying anything?

442
01:07:19,155 --> 01:07:19,655
Bible

443
01:07:21,024 --> 01:07:22,125
say something

444
01:07:34,431 --> 01:07:35,893
Don’t act like this

445
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:37,839
what’s wrong?

446
01:07:40,110 --> 01:07:41,151
Jed , just go home.

447
01:07:43,247 --> 01:07:44,824
I have a wife and a child now.

448
01:07:48,207 --> 01:07:49,577
They’re probably waiting for me.

449
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,924
If I leave,

450
01:07:54,462 --> 01:07:55,614
I’ll go see them.

451
01:07:58,835 --> 01:07:59,895
And

452
01:08:00,915 --> 01:08:02,629
I approached you

453
01:08:03,541 --> 01:08:05,451
because I wanted you to help with money,

454
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:08,625
and you really did help me

455
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:12,697
Are you joking with me?

456
01:08:14,446 --> 01:08:15,337
Jed,

457
01:08:18,520 --> 01:08:19,754
is this enough for us?

458
01:08:25,832 --> 01:08:27,078
Enough of what?

459
01:08:30,561 --> 01:08:33,239
We were never anything to each other in the first place right?

460
01:08:35,140 --> 01:08:37,041
We just agreed to be like siblings

461
01:08:40,177 --> 01:08:41,595
But if you mean

462
01:08:47,345 --> 01:08:48,477
that from now on

463
01:08:49,765 --> 01:08:51,345
we shouldn’t even be anything to each other,

464
01:08:52,311 --> 01:08:53,532
not even acquaintances

465
01:09:03,464 --> 01:09:05,125
this is what you want, right?

466
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:19,952
Answer me.

467
01:09:25,857 --> 01:09:27,453
Why aren’t you answering?

468
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:11,791
What did you say to him?

469
01:10:12,489 --> 01:10:13,363
Why is he...

470
01:10:18,141 --> 01:10:18,641
He?

471
01:10:20,949 --> 01:10:21,730
What do you mean, he?

472
01:10:23,985 --> 01:10:25,341
Don’t deflect

473
01:10:26,267 --> 01:10:27,193
answer first.

474
01:10:31,099 --> 01:10:32,921
You’re still the same, 100% yourself

475
01:10:35,927 --> 01:10:37,410
not thinking ahead

476
01:10:39,611 --> 01:10:40,910
just doing whatever you want.

477
01:10:44,329 --> 01:10:45,332
Let me ask you something

478
01:10:48,547 --> 01:10:49,476
are you sure

479
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:52,837
you can stay with him?

480
01:10:54,926 --> 01:10:56,077
And if he goes out

481
01:10:59,405 --> 01:11:00,772
and causes trouble

482
01:11:02,668 --> 01:11:03,544
behaves badly

483
01:11:07,086 --> 01:11:07,997
hurts others

484
01:11:08,945 --> 01:11:09,893
becomes a complete asshole...

485
01:11:12,748 --> 01:11:13,992
What are you going to do?

486
01:11:16,821 --> 01:11:17,464
What will you do?

487
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:19,072
Answer.

488
01:11:22,641 --> 01:11:25,029
And if he really has a wife and a child like he said,

489
01:11:26,394 --> 01:11:27,437
what are you going to do?

490
01:11:27,937 --> 01:11:29,360
Are you going to be his mistress?

491
01:11:34,241 --> 01:11:34,882
Answer me

492
01:11:40,830 --> 01:11:43,360
Do you really think people in prison can love each other like that?

493
01:11:45,442 --> 01:11:47,524
Is it really that romantic?

494
01:11:51,940 --> 01:11:53,010
What’s gotten into you?

495
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,579
Go get your head checked out

496
01:12:34,104 --> 01:12:34,674
Please stop

497
01:12:41,331 --> 01:12:42,546
Take me back.

498
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:48,591
I don’t want to be here anymore.
