2
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,600
What are you doing? Come help me.

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,080
I put in effort to help.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:28,720
I don't know how to scrub.

5
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,880
- You don't know how to scrub?
- Right.

6
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,720
- Then just get in the water!
- Wait! I can't swim.

7
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,240
What the heck?

8
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,920
You can't clean, and now you can't even swim?

9
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,160
Damn, you're terrible!

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,080
Come here.

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,720
I'll teach you how to swim.

12
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:53,480
Come here.

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,920
- The guard will scold us.
- Hurry up.

14
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,440
Why would the guard scold us? I'm right here.

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,200
Today's cleaning shift.

16
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:05,080
Relax. We can get in the water.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,120
Hurry up.

18
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,360
Come here.

19
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:09,480
Hold on.

20
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,440
That's fine. Hurry up. It's cold.

21
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,280
- Wait.
- Quickly.

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,280
Hurry up and clean, or you'll be punished.

23
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,920
[Our time together was brief, yet our hearts will remember for eternity.]

24
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:46,440
You like it? You’re really enjoying it.

25
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,080
Bible!

26
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:29,240
I was trying to make him mine, damn.

27
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,600
(Hi, mom.)

28
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,520
(This is my first letter that I wrote to you.)

29
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,320
(You don't have to worry about me.)

30
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,960
(Everything's fine.)

31
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,320
(I'm getting used to it a bit.)

32
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,240
(The biggest problem for me is the toilet.)

33
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,200
(It hurts my legs when I sit, I get cramps every time.)

34
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:39,240
(I'm still not used to taking communal showers.)

35
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,520
(And about the food...)

36
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,680
(It's not bad.)

37
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,120
(I also got a regular job.)

38
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,640
(I'm working in the bag-folding section.)

39
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,000
(And the best thing is...)

40
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:00,560
(They have a lot of books to read here.)

41
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,960
(I've read almost half the room already.)

42
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:11,600
(Please do not worry about me, mom.)

43
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,160
(It won't be long, we'll meet each other again.)

44
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,440
(And then I'm going to work and pay everyone back.)

45
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,880
(I won't be careless anymore.)

46
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,920
(Mom, wait for me.)

47
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,520
(I'll take you on a trip.)

48
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,320
(Please take care of yourself.)

49
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,600
(Don't stress, I'm fine.)

50
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,440
(Totally fine.)

51
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,760
(Love you, mom.)

52
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:48,400
[The sky, the sun, they beckon you to gaze.
Don't lower your eyes.]

53
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:04,600
Jed.

54
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,080
Is it your laundry day today?

55
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,720
I'm free now.

56
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,000
You can hire me.

57
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,760
Are you free now?

58
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,400
Yes, I'm free. Why?

59
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,080
Really free?

60
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,240
Got something to say?

61
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,360
How did you get in here?

62
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:10,000
I was arrested.

63
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,400
I know.

64
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,560
I mean what charge is it?

65
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,160
Didn't you see when you put the letter in my locker?

66
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,200
Answer me, hurry up.

67
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,680
Illegal arms trading.

68
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:33,600
Sentenced to three years and nine months.

69
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,160
I've already served two years.

70
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,360
I'm also considered a model inmate.

71
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,360
I might be home soon.

72
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,000
Anything else?

73
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,200
What about...

74
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,600
Do you have a crush?

75
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,840
With a face like this,

76
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,440
What do you think?

77
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,080
And...

78
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,480
What will you do when you get out?

79
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,360
Maybe go get my degree.

80
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,120
What do you mean?

81
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,160
I mean...

82
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,680
I was arrested two days before graduation.

83
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,240
Such bad luck.

84
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,840
What did you study?

85
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,920
International Business Administration.

86
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,280
- Are you kidding me?
- What?

87
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,600
You're messing with me.

88
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,680
Doesn't look like I studied?

89
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,520
You kind of.

90
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,560
Just kind of.

91
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,440
Anything else?

92
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,080
I need to go hang the clothes.

93
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,200
Bible.

94
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,240
When you get out, can you call me?

95
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,200
I might have some work for you.

96
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,480
Sure.

97
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,080
You drop your phone number for me then.

98
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:33,440
I'll call to you.

99
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:35,960
Are you sure?

100
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:36,680
Yes.

101
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,720
If there’s a strange number call you, just answer it.

102
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,080
Don’t think it’s scam call center number then.

103
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:44,520
Okay?

104
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:23,600
What are you doing?

105
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,280
What’s on your mind?

106
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,040
Just want to try something like this.

107
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,480
If we get caught, we'll be put on record for misconduct.

108
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,000
Are you sure?

109
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,400
I'm not scared.

110
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,680
Oh my god, hurry up.

111
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,080
Where are you taking me?

112
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,840
This Bible's guy?

113
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,520
I think so.

114
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,680
What are you been charged with?

115
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:25,760
Check fraud.

116
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,560
Do you know what?

117
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,880
Bible owes me money.

118
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,760
- So, what are you gonna do?
- Take him to the point of no return.

119
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,000
How much does he owe you?

120
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,480
It won’t make you go broke!

121
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,320
Then just tell me what you’re gonna do.

122
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,000
Tell me.

123
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,400
How much?

124
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,760
[As the sun rose, just woke with thanks.]

125
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,880
You've smoked enough, it's my turn now. Stop already!

126
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,760
Give me some.

127
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:37,160
F*ck you!

128
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,160
Quickly.

129
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,400
Hey, Jed.

130
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:59,760
The tally from this morning is correct, everything’s fine.

131
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,280
Well...

132
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,600
Yes.

133
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,680
That will be all for now.

134
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,480
You guys who are smoking, get out here now!

135
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,120
Come to the front!

136
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,200
Don’t make me come to you!

137
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,560
- Here we go again.
- Hurry up!

138
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:35,840
- We're getting punished again.
- Go.

139
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,200
- One more.
- Just go, man.

140
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,320
You guys, come here.

141
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:54,080
Stand in line.

142
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,680
Move up.

143
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,200
Stop moving. Same faces as always.

144
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,400
Bird!

145
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:02,480
Yes, sir.

146
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,000
Do you really want to get out of here?

147
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,880
Didn’t you learn anything from last time’s punishment?

148
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:10,640
Nop, stop pretending.

149
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,240
Still don't feel guilty? Look at me!

150
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,800
All of you...

151
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:19,920
Head to the work building, alright?

152
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:21,880
Wait a sec.

153
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:25,800
Hello, Doctor.

154
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,360
Go ahead, you guys.

155
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,120
I’ll follow shortly.

156
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:36,360
Oh...

157
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,760
These guys are troublemakers, Doctor.

158
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,960
They’ve been sneaking around smoking.

159
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,200
I apologize for bothering you today. I’d like you to check on the prisoners.

160
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,120
They’ve been sick for a few days.

161
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:58,080
There are quite a few today, so it might be a bit busy.

162
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:18,040
I won’t smoke anymore.

163
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,440
[Pathomkarn Siri.]

164
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,640
[Please come to the front to visit relatives.]

165
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,240
It's you, Pathomkarn.

166
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,360
Pathomkarn Siri.

167
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,120
It's you, right?

168
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,920
Hey, Jed.

169
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,880
You remember my relative's phone number, right?

170
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,240
Please tell them to call to my family.

171
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,120
Just tell them to visit me. Can you?

172
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,240
What's the phone number?

173
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,320
It's 089-887-8960.

174
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,560
Awesome!

175
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,880
Damn, you're so amazing!

176
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,560
You can always be trusted. Let's go, bro.

177
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,760
Thank you, Jed.
