How much do you owe to end up in jail like this?

3
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,388
7 million baht.

4
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:15,849
This is a criminal case, you know?

5
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,685
For this case, it has to be handled in court.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,061
But you can request to pay in installments.

7
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:22,313
Go, next person.

8
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:24,858

11
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,754
(The guard has asked me to take care of you guys.)

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:29,798

14

Like this.

15
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,688
If you can't sleep, just close your eyes.

20
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:34,320
Don't come back here again.

21
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:35,613
Get it?

Is that thing over with yet?

27
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:27,498
What thing?

28
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:30,376
Well.

29
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:32,337
The cheques.

30

No, it's still not done. There are 6 more checks left.

I'm constantly in touch with him.

He understands.

33
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,066
Seriously, man.

34
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:56,986
I don’t have any money left to bail you out anymore.

35
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,073
My family is really pissed off at me because of that.

36
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:05,995
I'm so sorry.

37
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:08,748
That's fine.

38
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,417
No problem.

hoop up with a prisoner?

46
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:51,291
It's just one night, man.

47

62
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,929
Are you Mr. Pathomkarn Siri?

63
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:33,810
Yes, I am.

64
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,608
Please follow me to the station now. You have an arrest warrant.

Playing in a music video here?

70
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:38,749
Well, did you steal this guitar to play here again?

71
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,005
Did you know about him yet?

72
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:46,174
That he owes Kan a thousand.

73
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,385

74
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:54,307
What about you, what's next?

75
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:10,323
Let's see.

76
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,160
Follow me.

77
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:21,083

81
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:02,250
I'll pay it back, bro. My family haven't visited me yet.

82
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,211
Can I smoke too?

83
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:14,929
Wanna smoke?

84
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,231

What should you do?

86
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:40,121
So what should I do about him, hmm?

87
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:50,131
Alright.

88
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,800
I'll let you delay the payment for now.

89
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,760
But...

90
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:58,139
You must have sex with View for me, can you do that?

91
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:00,766

Come help us wash the dishes.

187
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:18,076
Then I’ll help you find your shirt.

188
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,329
Wash dishes? And I’ll get my shirt back?

189
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,080
That's right.

190
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:23,999
Are you kidding me?

191
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:25,333
Come on.

192
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,671
Do it. I'll help you.

193
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:21,556
I'm sorry.

194
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:23,433
Just want to fill the water for you.

195
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:35,820
Are you okay, right?

196
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:37,364
I'll bring your shirt back.

197
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,616
You definitely have a shirt to change into.

198
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,830
Hey.

199
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:48,124
Why are you come back here again?

200
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,839
Or miss me?

201
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,330
Hey, here.

202
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,041
I’ve done what I promised.

203
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:14,794
Here's your shirt.

204
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,220
Take it.

205
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:34,439
Did you steal mine?

206
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,195
Listen up.

207
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:43,907
In here,

208
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,910
There are a lot of people like me.

209
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,454
A lot of assh*les.

210
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,668
But you have to keep fighting.

211
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,088
You must survive in here as well.

212
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,553
Or else... you won't be happy.

213
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:09,057
Got it?

214
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,190
But in here, can we find a happiness?

215
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:19,609
Are you kidding me?

216
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:26,699
Listen to me.

217
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,286
I'll make you know.

218
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,873
What is...

219
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:37,252
'Paradise in Hell'

220
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:54,894
Good luck.

221
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:56,312
I'm going now.

222
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:17,166
Right, keep fighting, Jed.
