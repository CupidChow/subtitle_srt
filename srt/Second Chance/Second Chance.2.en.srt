166
00:14:14,609 --> 00:14:17,729
The next move is the uppercut.

167
00:14:17,729 --> 00:14:19,790
1, 2, 3!

168
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:23,489
Just kidding

169
00:14:23,489 --> 00:14:25,889
Okay, here we go! Right, right, left, left.

170
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:29,949
Go. Right, right, left, left, right, right, left—

171
00:14:29,949 --> 00:14:31,529
Your face is so stiff. Relax a little.

172
00:14:31,529 --> 00:14:35,050
Move your head around as well, all right?

173
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,329
Punch right, okay? 1, 2, 3!

174
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:39,990
Move your head!

175
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:48,510
Okay, so now we'll punch a target.

176
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:51,209
If I say "Yaep," punch with your left hand.

177
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,309
- Got it?
- Yeah.

178
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:55,909
- All right. Ready?
- Yup.

179
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,209
Yaep.

180
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:00,530
Punch harder!

181
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,670
Right, too.

182
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,880
Just like that...

183
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:09,209
Are you teasing me?

184
00:15:09,209 --> 00:15:11,729
Tease what? Let's do it one more time.

185
00:15:11,729 --> 00:15:15,049
Punch right. Right again.

186
00:15:15,049 --> 00:15:18,969
Punch harder! Left, right, left.

187
00:15:18,969 --> 00:15:22,500
Harder!

188
00:15:23,649 --> 00:15:26,510
Ugh, I'm out. I'm tired.

189
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:29,790
What?

190
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,329
Hey, why are you learning Muay-Thai?

191
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:39,129
You don't really look like a person who likes Muay-Thai.

192
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:40,670
Right?

193
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:47,729
Hey, I'm talking to you. Am I right?

194
00:15:47,729 --> 00:15:50,049
You're here to teach, so do teaching only.

195
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:51,810
What the...

196
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:03,830
Hey, Jeno, how are you going back?

197
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,410
Do you want a ride?

198
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:10,130
It's already dark.

199
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:12,729
And it's dangerous.

200
00:16:12,729 --> 00:16:16,110
And it seems like no one's here to pick you up.

201
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:18,110
I'll take you back, okay?

202
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,690
No, thanks. My dad will come and pick me up.

203
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,360
When is he coming?

204
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,410
Want me to wait with you?

205
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,730
I don't know.

206
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,990
It's okay. Just go back already.

207
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:39,110
Why don't you call your dad?

208
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,830
Can I ask a question?

209
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:54,250
What is it?

210
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,670
Can I hit on you?

211
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,729
Can I?

212
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:03,690
But we just met?

213
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,469
- Who said we just met?
- Huh?

214
00:17:07,469 --> 00:17:09,029
What did you say?

215
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:11,030
Nothing.

216
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,550
I guess you don't remember it.

217
00:17:25,910 --> 00:17:27,550
Your dad?

218
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:56,929
I'll pass it to Chris, so don't worry about it.

219
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:59,610
You should worry about yourself.

220
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:04,410
Here you go again.

221
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,750
I am already so tired.

222
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:15,630
Was it that tiring?

223
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,289
Right.

224
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:20,150
You know I hate studying for a long time.

225
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:25,029
Be patient.

226
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:28,910
You know how important the upcoming exam and the grades are.

227
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:31,250
You're about to graduate.

228
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:36,850
I'll help you get through it.

229
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:39,469
You mean it?

230
00:18:39,469 --> 00:18:40,910
Yes.

231
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,449
You really aren't going back home with me?

232
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:50,729
I'm sorry. I got some errands to run.

233
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:53,950
So maybe next time.

234
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,870
Okay.

235
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,250
See you then.

236
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:10,430
Let me know once you're home.

237
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:55,590
Hello?

238
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,770
I've already eaten. How about you, Mom?

239
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:04,249
I'm about to sleep now.

240
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:06,090

Stop it.

272
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,810
So what's going on?

00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:56,790
Actually…

Gosh, actually what?

275
00:21:59,329 --> 00:22:01,430
Calm down.

276
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,330
Actually, I...

277
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:08,209
I like Jeno.

278
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:12,710
Wait. Jeno? Geneva's younger brother?

279
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,850
How did it happen?

280
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,169
Wow, now you are interested in it?

281
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,749
Just now when I asked for help, you weren't even bothered.

282
00:22:22,749 --> 00:22:26,609
Come on! So how?

283
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:30,130
Why don't you confess to Jeno then?

284
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:33,529
I already did.

285
00:22:33,529 --> 00:22:37,729
But he doesn't seem to like me.

286
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:39,669
- I knew it.
- What are you laughing at?

287
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:40,969
Serves you right.

288
00:22:40,969 --> 00:22:44,449
Hey, Fah, look at what your friend just said.

289
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:47,409
He's not even helping and said, "Serves me right!"

290
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:49,049
Well, it serves you right.

291
00:22:49,049 --> 00:22:51,009
And what can I even do for you?

292
00:22:51,009 --> 00:22:54,330
Jeno said it himself that he's not interested in you.

293
00:22:57,250 --> 00:23:03,790
Well, actually, Jeno and I met each other a long time ago.

294
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:11,510
And I even took him back home before.

295
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:15,949
I feel so attached to him.

296
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:18,529
But the thing is...

297
00:23:18,529 --> 00:23:20,550
Jeno can't remember me.

298
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:28,369
And today, he got bullied.

299
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:29,969
I feel bad about it.

300
00:23:29,969 --> 00:23:31,730
What happened?

301
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:33,969
Why was he getting bullied?

302
00:23:33,969 --> 00:23:37,009
I also don't know. He doesn't want to tell me.

303
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:39,829
Hold on. I think I know why.

304
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:44,689
I saw Jeno getting bullied two, three times already.

305
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:46,089
It was a good thing I happened to be there.

306
00:23:46,089 --> 00:23:48,969
If not, he would have gotten beaten up by Arthur's gang.

307
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,970
Those douchebags again!

308
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,589
- Hey, calm down.
- He got bullied again?

309
00:23:55,410 --> 00:24:01,570
Yeah, tell him to be careful.

310
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:08,510
And it's not like I don't want to help you,

311
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:11,849
it's just that I'm not good at love.

312
00:24:11,849 --> 00:24:15,850
But if it's about studies, I surely can help.

313
00:24:20,870 --> 00:24:22,889
I'll be rooting for you.

314
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:25,150
Feel free to tell me if anything's up.

315
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:30,330
Hey, don't won't worry.

316
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,129
He'll be fine.

317
00:24:32,129 --> 00:24:34,370
I already informed the teachers about it.

318
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,770
I don't get it.

319
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:44,610
What is it?

320
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,489
Why are you in such a rush?

321
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:55,460
Mayday! Mayday! Geno!

322
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,400
Jeno's not around, right?

323
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,389
Nope. He went to the teacher's office.

324
00:24:59,389 --> 00:25:01,009
Great!

325
00:25:01,009 --> 00:25:02,529
What about my brother?

326
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:04,089
Listen carefully.

327
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,890
What is it?

328
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,489
What the hell?

329
00:25:07,489 --> 00:25:09,129

- What about him?

330
00:25:09,129 --> 00:25:12,289
Chris is hitting on Jeno.

331
00:25:12,289 --> 00:25:14,709
- What?
- Isn't it so lit?

332
00:25:14,709 --> 00:25:18,529
- You sure about it?
- No, I know him the best.

333
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:26,129
- Who are you looking for?
- Where's Pink anyway?

334
00:25:26,129 --> 00:25:28,730
I don't know where she disappeared too.

335
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,449
Maybe it's magic!

336
00:25:30,449 --> 00:25:33,529
Magic, my ass!

337
00:25:33,529 --> 00:25:36,289
But you said she disappeared, and you don't know where is.

338
00:25:36,289 --> 00:25:38,050
Whatever.

339
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:44,160
Umm... and are you okay that Chris is going to...

340
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:48,249
Yeah, I'm okay.

341
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:52,850
It's his right to like someone.

342
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:58,009
But I guess I'll have to keep an eye on him.

343
00:25:58,009 --> 00:26:01,550
Do you remember when he was with Arthur?

344
00:26:01,550 --> 00:26:04,650
Now they are over, but Arthur's still pestering Jeno.

345
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:10,469
But hey, I swear to god, if Jeno's with Chris,

346
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:13,130
I won't let anyone hurt him.

347
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:16,540
Yeah, right!

348
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:23,260
- And Chris even asked Tong Fah and Paper to help him hit on Jeno.
- Really?

349
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,129
It's so lit, right?

350
00:26:26,129 --> 00:26:29,030
Why are you girls so excited?

351
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:35,269
It's a good thing that these four questions we did before came up in the final.

352
00:26:35,269 --> 00:26:38,250
I guess the teacher's not too harsh on us after all.

353
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,380
Hi, Paper.

354
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,910
I got something for you.

355
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,570
Please take it.

356
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:58,980
Go ahead.

357
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:00,840
Thank you.

358
00:27:12,830 --> 00:27:14,550
Hello, Sir.

359
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:18,470
I brought him in because I have something important to inform you of.

360
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:24,390
This is the daily inspection report I wrote.

361
00:27:27,330 --> 00:27:30,370
I saw one student getting violently abused.

362
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:36,469
And I have confirmed that Arthur is the one doing the assault.

363
00:27:36,469 --> 00:27:40,530
There's CCTV footage in it as evidence.

364
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:45,029
Arthur assaulted him in the toilet for the first time.

365
00:27:45,029 --> 00:27:47,970
Then around the corner.

366
00:27:51,390 --> 00:27:55,349
Please take action against him.

367
00:27:55,349 --> 00:27:58,349
Chris, calm down.

368
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:02,410
I'll have to find out what happened first.

369
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:06,350
Don't get too emotional.

370
00:28:06,350 --> 00:28:08,710
You have to deal with this logically.

371
00:28:10,970 --> 00:28:13,070
You looking for me?

372
00:28:17,210 --> 00:28:19,889
Jeno, tell me.

373
00:28:19,889 --> 00:28:23,010
Is it true that Arthur assaulted you?

374
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:31,740
Jeno, take it easy.

375
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,670
Tell me about it.

376
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:43,640
Arthur, you are suspended for a month.

377
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,830
But I didn't assault him.

378
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:49,550
I don't want to suspend you.

379
00:28:49,550 --> 00:28:52,650
But you should be responsible for your own actions.

380
00:29:00,390 --> 00:29:04,170
Behind every able man, there are always other able men.

381
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,290
Stop!

[Second Chance: The Series]

383
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:29,630
Behind every able man, there are always other able men.

384
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:33,830
Stop!

385
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:41,009
You youngsters tend to think

386
00:29:41,009 --> 00:29:44,970
violence can solve everything.

387
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:47,470
Have your own thoughts.

388
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:52,530
But that shouldn't be used to hurt someone else.

389
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,100
Arthur, you are suspended for one term.

390
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:06,550
You can't be doing this to me!

391
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,680
Get out!

392
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:34,830
Hey, you really ain't letting me in?

393
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,440
I even gave you a ride.

394
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,480
I didn't ask for it.

395
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,270
I know you didn't ask for it.

396
00:30:42,270 --> 00:30:44,120
But it's already dark,

397
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:47,759
and it's dangerous to go back alone.

398
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,480
I normally go back at this time.

399
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,660
Well, fine... but... I'm thirsty and my mouth hurts.

400
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,500
Stay here. I'll grab it for you.

401
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,799
I'm tired. I want to sit.

402
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,439
Sit here then.

403
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,870
There're so many mosquitoes here.

404
00:31:07,870 --> 00:31:10,030
Just please let me in.

405
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,540
Hey, just leave already.

406
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:16,320
Why are you so mean?

407
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,950
You're late.

408
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,420
Hey, Chris.

409
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,340
What's up with your face?

410
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,760
Come on in.

411
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:04,359
Ouch! I haven't even touched it.

412
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,919
It's practice, just in case it hurts.

413
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,960
Turn your head.

414
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,959
Ouch! It really hurts. Be gentle.

415
00:32:12,959 --> 00:32:15,820
It's just saline.

416
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:20,280
Ouch. Be gentle!

417
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,000
- There's more?
- Of course. This is the ointment.

418
00:32:38,376 --> 00:32:40,520
Ouch...

419
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,600
Just a bit.

420
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,980
Thanks for today.

421
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:02,480
Done. You should leave now.

422
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,030
I don't want to.

423
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:05,680
Just leave already.

00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,600
No!

425

Ouch! It hurts!

426
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,740
Stop being stubborn and leave.

What's the matter?

428
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:16,390
Nothing.

429
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:31,830
It really is nothing.

430
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:37,610
Fine. If you don't want to tell me, then don't.

431
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,110
I'll get going first then.

432
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,850
Do you want to go back with me?

433
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:49,850
It's fine. I can go back myself.

434
00:34:58,110 --> 00:35:02,090
Fine. Quick then.
