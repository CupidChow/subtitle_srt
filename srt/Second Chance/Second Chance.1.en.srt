Paper, stop. Listen to me.

2
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:09,980
Why did you even do this to me?

3
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,439
I am sorry. I don't want to lose you

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,580
Why did you even bring that topic up.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,860
I didn't mean to.

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,060
Listen to me first.

7
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
I am just frustrated.

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,400
I just wanted to let you know how I feel.

9
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,040
- You are more than a friend to me.
- Cut it out!

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,100
I like you.

11
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:52,320
I will always like you, even if you stop me.

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:56,600
Let go!

What do you mean?

00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,379
- You are so cocky
- Hmph.

Damn! I'm impressed.

00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:47,020
- Great job, dude.
- All right!

Okay.

Wait. Hold on.

Take care of yourself and let me know if you need help, all right?

00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,380
Sure.

Hey! Have you seen this?

It's super good that I'm like...

Let me take a look!

51
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,760
Gosh.

52
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,520
He's cool, isn't he?

53
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,980
Yeah, he sure is.

54
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:57,080
I heard that you had a crush on him or something?

55
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,381
No?

56
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:02,120
Come on, don't deny it. I saw you watching his Youtube clips several times.

57
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:05,940
I just watched it because he's cool. That's it.

58
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,700
Oh, by the way,

59
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,500
I am thinking of learning Muay-Thai.

60
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,620
What? You? Learn Muay Thai?

61
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,620
Why?

62
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,900
I want to test my limits.

63
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:21,600
I feel like I am in my comfort zone only,

64
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,200
and I want to get out of it.

65
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,220
Well then, give it a try.

66
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,220
You know I always support your decisions.

67
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:35,420
Good luck and do your best!

68
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,340
Thanks a lot.

69
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:43,300
- Let me tell you!
- What is it?
- You won't believe it.

70
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,519
Hey, look. What is he even doing?

71
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,680
- Hey, Chris, are you drumming in the room?
- Why?

72
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,780
I'll be the dancer then.

73
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,600

Hello, students.

75
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,120
Hi.

76
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:11,120
I'm going to help guide the grade 12 classes,

77
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,620
since it's an important time for everyone,

78
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:19,420
as you all have to choose your future career.

79
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,900
I want you all to focus during this time,

80
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:25,620
and get into the university you wish to enter.

81
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,759
If you have any questions,

82
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,260
please raise your hand and feel free to ask.

83
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,240
Teacher, I am interested in fashion studies

84
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,660
but my parents seem to be against it.

85
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:40,280
That's a difficult case.

86
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:46,060
But what matters the most is your future.

87
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,319
I suggest you talk it out with your parents,

88
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,780
and let them know why you want to study fashion.

89
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:03,199
What if we are unsure about what we want to study?

90
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,300
That's a very good question.

91
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,319
We all don't know what we are suitable for, right?

92
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:12,719
So try looking back on yourselves.

93
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:19,080
What are the things you like and good at?

94
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:25,940
But like I said it takes time to find the answer.

95
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:33,340
But if you keep exploring yourself you'll eventually find a way out.

96
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,780
- Look at him!
- Him?

97
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,600
Hey, guys, who do you think is the most charming?

98
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,440
The most charming?

99
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,980
I think it's him.

100
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:59,800
He normally looks nerdy but when he's on the court,

101
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,920
he looks pretty hot.

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,100
Yeah, true that.

103
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:09,280
Look at that aura! He's blinding me!

104
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,860
I just can't take it!

105
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,639
But I think Thong Fah is more attractive in a PE uniform.

106
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,440
It suits him perfectly!

107
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,740
I totally agree.

108
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,720
Right?

109
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,719
My heart.

110
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:29,420
And look at Tong Fah and Paper.

111
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:33,100
They are meant to be together. My heart's pounding!

112
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:37,319
I ship Tong Fah and Chris more.

113
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:43,780
Look at them! They are crazy cute together!

114
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,880
Oh sure.

115
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,430
Look!

116
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:51,300
Oh my god!

117
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,350
They are so hot!

118
00:08:56,520 --> 00:09:00,640
It's so hot today, but I think it was worth it.

119
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,500
- I know, right.
- Yeah, it was really good.

120
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,900
Sorry.

121
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:23,820
Are you okay?

122
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,520
I'm fine. Let's continue.

123
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:59,220
What's the matter? Can't take our hotness?

124
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:06,100
How funny, Chris. We were hyping over Paper's and Tong Fah's hotness.

125
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,940
Thanks.

126
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,640
Puke.

127
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,720
Go puke in the toilet.

128
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,980
I feel bad for those who have to clean up.

129
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,580
Oh, sure, Mr. Good Boy

130
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,740
You guys sure go together well.

131
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,439
Talking about the toilet,

132
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,480
I need to take a pee. I'll be right back.

133
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,240
What the hell?

134
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,820
Hey, Near!

135
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,300
- Yeah?
- Wanna join?

136
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,940
No, thanks.

137
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,200
Are you working at the board game cafe this evening?

138
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,319
Yeah, why? Are you going?

139
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,559
Yeah, I want to, but I am not sure yet.

140
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,260
Let me know then. I'll reserve a table for you.

141
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,740
Thanks, dude.

142
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,180
I'll go now. I'm going to take a nap.

143
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:20,480
All right. See ya.

144
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,740
Hey!

145
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,600
What are you doing!

146
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:55,550
♫ It's that person, that one person ♫

147
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,680
Hey!

148
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,090
What are you doing!

149
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:08,410
We're just playing, so stop bugging us.

150
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:33,349
What the hell?

151
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,890
I'm just playing with you.

152
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,130
Now he has learned his lesson not to interrupt us again.

153
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,270
Let's go.

154
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,450
- Leave.
- Leave?
- Do you think he'll leave or come?

155
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:03,800
I think he'll run away.

156
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:08,050
Hey, what did you do? Why are you soaked?

157
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:13,140
It was so hot, so I poured water on myself.

158
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,020
- What's wrong with him?
- I know right.

159
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,600
What the heck happened to you?

160
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,760
Gosh, stop asking.

161
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:25,700
Seriously, what did you do?

162
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:31,920
Fine. Arthur was bullying Jeno.

163
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,220
So I helped him.

164
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,600
Then he threw water on me in the bathroom.

165
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,959
Those jerks again?

166
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:44,080
Yes. Totally pisses me off.

00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,560
Go get changed.

168
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:47,960
Okay.

169
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,380
You too.

170
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,750
Okay, okay.

171
00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:06,010
You all are preparing for the college entrance exam, right?

172
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:09,110
Do you have any questions?

173
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,830
Hey! What are you guys chit-chatting about?

174
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,710
Is it related to the class?

175
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:29,010
I want you all to work harder and take things seriously.

176
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:31,650
For your own benefit.

177
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:34,030
Look at Near.

178
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,909
He's hardworking and is always asking questions

179
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:41,070
and got into his desired university.

180
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,150
That's it for today. See you in the next class.

181
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:51,050
How marvelous, already getting into a university.

182
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,589
I know, right? Even the teacher praised him.

183
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:56,490
I hope he can graduate for us.

184
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:11,390
Oh sorry! Your existence is barely there that I didn't see you.

185
00:15:14,070 --> 00:15:16,910
Oops, it slipped out of my hand.

186
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:22,960
What a pity. Don't think this is the end.

187
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,890
Let's go.

188
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,430
Hey, M.

189
00:15:58,150 --> 00:16:03,830
Oh, hey! Did you run? Why are you sweating?

190
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:08,890
Yeah, I had some issues, so I was running late.

191
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:12,469
- It's fine. Are you ready for work?
- Yup.

192
00:16:12,469 --> 00:16:19,170
Help me keep the board games on the shelf, okay?

193
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:20,690
Sure.

194
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,690
Hold on.

195
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:28,069
This is a new game. Try playing.

196
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:32,869
I'll teach you as you play.

197
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:34,410
Okay.

198
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,029
- What are you doing?
- What? I didn't do anything.

199
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:46,600
You must have a sixth sense or something. You can do it.

200
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,360
- No way.
- Yeah, you can.

201
00:17:26,630 --> 00:17:29,489
- Hi.
- Hi.

202
00:17:29,489 --> 00:17:33,389
My friends and I are looking for games to play.

203
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,850
Do you have any recommendations?

204
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:38,830
Board game?

205
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,390
Yup.

206
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:44,789
This one. It's a new one.

207
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:50,050
Forty baht per hour, and a hundred for home rental.

208
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:52,949
I am thinking of playing for two hours.

209
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:56,930
Is the game the only thing that I can rent?

210
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:03,490
Two hours, right?

211
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,910
Yeah, two hours.

212
00:18:06,910 --> 00:18:09,170
That'll be 80 baht each.

213
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:17,070
How much again?

214
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:20,249
- 80 per hour.
- Okay.

215
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,729
Here's your change.

216
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:37,710
Keep the change. I'll come and get it next time.

217
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:44,170
Okay. Please have a seat.

218

Okay.

- That should be it.

Here you go.

221
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:06,750
Here.

222
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,410
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

223
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,740
We all don't know about the game,

224
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,530
do you mind if you teach us?

225
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,310
Sure. I can explain it.

226
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:27,850
Thanks.

Says you. Don't think too much.

"Says you. Don't think too much."

I'm just saying random things.

Why aren't you answering your phone?

00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:39,690
Im sorry. I was daydreaming.

235
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:59,210
You miss your dad?

Yeah.

You know what?

238
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:50,410
I heard that the person who looks at the night sky

239
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,850
is the one who's feeling lonely.

240
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,630
Well, I think it's true.

241
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,210
Then, you are looking at the sky

242
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,190
because you are feeling lonely?

243
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,730
I guess?

244
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:27,870

Well, at least you have a mom to call

I'll always be here with you.

Yeah, gotcha.

270
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:23,930
I don't feel like playing anymore.

00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:39,000
How did that even happen?

335
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:47,160
Hey, if you don't tell me, how can I help you?

336
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,700
It's nothing.

337
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,900
Let me do it for you.

338
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,320
It's fine. I can do it myself.

339
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,300
You can't even see it. Come on, I'll do it.

340
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,280
Feel free to let me know if anything happens.

341
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,700
Thank you so much.

342
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,700
Oh, and...

343
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:20,300
can you please not tell Geneva about it?

344
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:27,620
Gosh, Arthur's gang is becoming too much.

345
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:35,740
The principal is aware that there is school violence.

346
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,500
I'm doing my best to keep an eye on it.

347
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:44,280
Our school has a campaign to reduce violence,

348
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:48,440
but there's still a group of kids who are still using violence.

349
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,160
Mr. Alan, as the Head of Discipline,

350
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,400
do you have any suggestion to prevent violence?

351
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:57,480
It's difficult for me to handle too.

352
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,560
No matter how many rules and regulations the school imposes,

353
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:07,720
there are still a few students who don't follow. That's why I can only teach and then go back for a month only.

354
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:12,760
Are you okay?

355
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,340
Yeah.

356
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:21,360
I'm sorry that I couldn't help you much.

357
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,280
Forget about it.

358
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,219
Don't let them do as they please.

359
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,780
We are all humans. No one should be hurting someone.

360
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,600
Oh, and about the Muay Thai,

361
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,040
go for it. I'll be rooting for you.

362
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:45,980
Why are you glancing?

363
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,520
You mean it?

364
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:58,579
Of course! You are all beaten up. Why are you hesitating?

365
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,580
You can use it as self-defense.

366
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,640
Right.

367
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,320
Does it hurt a lot?

368
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,060
Of course.

369
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,099
Where have you been?

370
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,240
I've been waiting for so long.

371
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:41,160
I went to the nurses office.

372
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:44,459
What happened? Why did you go to the nurses office?

373
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,880
I bumped into Geneva's younger brother,

374
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,520
and he was getting bullied by Arthur's gang.

375
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,760
So I took him there.

376
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:54,900
Oh... Is it all settled now?

377
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:58,800
Yeah. I really want them to get kicked out of the school.

378
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,560
They are becoming too much.

379
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:07,120
Chill. We do what we can.

380
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,400
I know.

381
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,280
And I don't want you to get hurt.

382
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,780
They like messing around with people.

383
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,620
I'll be careful.

384
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:33,520
Good.

385
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,360
Take care of yourself.

386
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,060
I am worried about you.

387
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,760
I am the president of the school council.

388
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,060
Who would dare to mess with me?

389
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:55,859
Hey, let's grab something to eat. I'm hungry.

390
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:57,500
Sure.

391
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:01,600
Let's go.

392
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:08,020
♫ The cold wind said that you were still in my heart ♫

393
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,700
♫ The cold wind said that you are still far away ♫

394
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:17,600
The movie you took me to the other day, was fun.

395
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,419
I enjoyed it too.

396
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:22,780
I want to watch that kind of movie again.

397
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:28,940
♫ That one person...  ♫

398
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:33,659
The moment you get back home, do your homework first

399
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,200
so you don't have to stay up late.

400
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:39,060
Can't I do it on another day?

401
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:41,880
You are always saying this.

402
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,280
What are you going to do instead of homework?

403
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:48,040
How about Jenga?

404
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,720
You only think about playing games.

405
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,940
How about you find something interesting to do?

406
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:57,440
I got things that I'm interested in.

407
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,220
What are they?

408
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,420
I'm not telling you.

409
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,280
Let's play jenga.

410
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:19,160
Fine, fine. You are so distracted today.

411
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:24,600
You weren't even listening to me when I was explaining.

412
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,500
You only think of having fun.

413
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:28,859
Why are you so whiny.

414
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:32,200
You little...

415
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:36,720
Easy.

416
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,380
Duh! You drew it from the safe zone.

417
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,740
Your hands are actually big. Bigger than the Jenga game.

418
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:57,260
Are they?

419
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:02,280
Look! Your hands have gotten bigger.

420
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,480
They used to be around my size.

421
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,920
Try this side?

422
00:36:10,540 --> 00:36:13,179
See! Your hands are actually bigger than mine.

423
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,380
That's because you still have a little baby's hand.

424
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,140
Everything will be fine, right?

425
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:36,440
Do you think Jeno is telling the truth?

426
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,380
That he did not tell anyone about me cheating?

427
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:41,419
I think so.

428
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,560
You've beaten him so badly.

429
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,080
He would have admitted it if he actually did tell people about it.

430
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,280
Exactly.

431
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,760
And don't forget that you also sold the exam paper to someone else.

432
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,960
Hey, keep it down!

433
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,200
What Suer said has a point.

434
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,120
If it's not Jeno,

435
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,920
then it means it's the one that we sold the exam paper to.

436
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,620
Shit!

437
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,760
He came in so quietly.

438
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,620
Do you think he heard it?

439
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:28,399
- What do you want?
- Nothing.

440
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:33,280
I asked you a question, and you didn't answer.

441
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:36,800
Don't mess with me.

442
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,880
Why can't we mess with you?

443
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,460
I asked if you heard anything.

444
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:46,580
You're really not going to answer?

445
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,260
You surely haven't learned your lesson.

446
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:12,860
Stay still.

447
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:18,580
Damn! He looks good with it!

448
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,520
Were you trying to ask for help?

449
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,000
Stay away from me!

450
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,800
Such a good boy, eh!

451
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,139
You wanna try me?

452
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,619
How dare you go around telling people that I cheated on the exam!

453
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,580
Behind every able man, there are always other able men.

454
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,820
- What's the matter?
- Nothing

455
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,619
It's really nothing.

456
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:37,220
If you don't want to tell me, then don't.

457
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,370
♫ When the cold wind blows  ♫

458
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:02,850
♫ It makes me realize who is warm ♫

459
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:06,610
♫ When the cold wind passes ♫

460
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:14,500
♫ It makes you know who your heart misses, that person ♫

461
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:18,640
♫ That one person ♫

462
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:26,100
♫ That one person... That one person ♫

463
00:40:28,070 --> 00:40:34,200
♫ The cold wind said that you were still in my heart ♫

464
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:42,590
♫ The cold wind said that you are still far away ♫

465
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,240
♫ And the cold wind still hasn't taken you out of my mind ♫
