You're a student with potential.

93
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,280
I want you to choose a place that can bring that out to the fullest.

if I studied what I like.

100
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:45,120
But you are the one studying, and for 4 years.

101
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:49,720
So it's better to pursue what you like.

What the heck?

167
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,880
It's a board game cafe nearby.

168
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,260
Anything else? I really need to go.

169
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,960
Not really. See you around then.

170
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,819
Aren't you eating?

171
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,779
Why?

172
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,259
Let me have a bite then.

173
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,419
Go ahead.

174
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:12,659
You always ask for a bite.

175
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,759
So soft.

176
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:15,919
How is it?

177
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,460

Smile.

182
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,839
Enough. Let's get back to our studies.

183
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:43,339
No pictures for me?

184

Shit! I'll get going.

Where are you going?

188
00:13:56,019 --> 00:13:57,999
We just started.

189
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,839
I'm not good at studies.

190
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:04,860
But I'm very good if it's about love.

191
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,090
So, bye!

192

What the hell is wrong with him?

193
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:17,679
You too! You're the same as him.

194
00:14:17,679 --> 00:14:20,609
It's already an hour, but you got to solve only a few

195
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:22,889
Concentrate!

196
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:25,050

So, we're officially together now!

205
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,610
At least there's somebody that likes me.

206
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,969
How was it today? Did you have fun?

207
00:15:51,969 --> 00:15:54,149
Yeah.

208
00:15:54,149 --> 00:15:55,389
Good to hear.

209
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:59,290
Actually, it's a good thing that you are learning Muay-Thai.

210
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:04,430
You can use it to defend yourself next time.

211
00:16:06,170 --> 00:16:10,250
Don't forget to train at home, too.

212
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,930
Sure.

213
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,540
Does it hurt?

214
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,523
Sorry about it.

215
00:16:24,524 --> 00:16:26,984
Maybe it was a little too tough.

216
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:34,580
It's all right. It's normal to get hurt when working out.

217
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,559
Let me take a look.

218

Sorry!

222

Give me your hand.

223
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,460
Come on.

This spray is really good.

226
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:25,250
If your hand hurts again, feel free to use it.

00:17:46,989 --> 00:17:48,649
It's okay. I can get back myself.

00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:50,740
No way!

234
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:57,010
What if Arthur comes and messes with you again?
