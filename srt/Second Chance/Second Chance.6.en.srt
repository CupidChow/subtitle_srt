Both, about the game and this.

2
00:00:02,259 --> 00:00:03,759
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

3
00:00:03,759 --> 00:00:05,919
I didn't expect it to be like this.

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:07,860
Yes, I don't want to see you.

5
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:13,690
If you don't want to see me anymore, feel free to let me know. I will go away.

6
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,350
You sure you can handle it?

7
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,420
But I'm not okay.

How are you feeling? I missed you.

10
00:00:23,790 --> 00:00:25,880
Well, I'm right here.

11
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:27,540
Don't be scared.

12
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:29,570
I will always be here.

00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,300
How are you?

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,800
Well, still alive and still breathing.

15
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,579
Stop being so silly.

16
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,360
Don't talk about dying,

17
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,480
I will punch you.

18
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,880

You know what, Chris?

On the day of the accident,

21
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,869
when I was about to lose consciousness,

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:05,630
I didn't want to die.

23
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:10,060
It made me realize...

24
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,050
how important it is to be alive.

25
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,650

or like someone,

27
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,760
we shouldn't simply wait.

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,310
We should just act it out.

29
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:36,950
We'll never know when we will die.

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:43,400
It's better than not doing anything.

you are honest with your feelings.

And I don't want you to give up.

34
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:05,520
I will not give up, either.

Exactly.

Do you want more eggs?

193

You should eat more healthily.

I heard that the person who looks at the night sky

is the one who's feeling lonely.

196

But I don't feel lonely at all.

I came with Jeno.

Yeah.

Yes, Sir.

I got something to talk to you about.

You know that using violence against people,

I am sorry.

260

You don't have to say sorry to me.

261
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:36,719
Because I am not the one you should feel bad about.

262
00:19:36,719 --> 00:19:40,420
It's those people who were hurt by you.

263
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,920
If you are aware of what is right or wrong,

264
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,819
and you're still doing a wrongful act,

265
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:57,700
you're only hurting yourself.

00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,940
Do what your heart says.

339
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:16,030
You might end up smiling, laughing,

340
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,080
but at least you'd have followed what your heart says.

341
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:27,460
Don't be afraid of what the result might bring.

342
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:31,940
What is important is that you have acted as your heart says.

343
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:37,260
At least you won't regret not trying.

344
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,339
Last but not least,

345
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:49,800
I want every one of you to appreciate everything in your life.

346
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:53,260
Not only the good things you've encountered,

347
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:00,720
but also the bad things that happened.

348
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,939
Because all these experiences

349
00:29:04,939 --> 00:29:09,240
shape who you are today.

350
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,960
Thank you.

351
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,720
What are you doing alone?

352
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,540
Can I talk to you?

353
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,280
I am sorry about what happened the other day.

354
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:10,480
It's my fault that I didn't dare to tell you the truth.

355
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,860
Why?

356
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:22,040
I was scared that you'd not like me.

357
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,840
I didn't mean to lie to you.

358
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:33,340
Yeah, I get you.

359
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,800
I am sorry, too.

360
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,100
For throwing my temper out at you

361
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:45,219
and not being willing to listen to you.

362
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,570
It's okay.

363
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:53,240
You got your reasons.

364
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:01,500
Why are you here anyway?

365
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,160
Because I knew that someone was here.

366
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:12,500
But you were gone for so long.

367
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,860
That's because I thought you were still mad.

368
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,980
So you didn't show up?

369
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,090
Well, here I am now.

370
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,940
Why are you all dressed up anyway?

371
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,800
You can't even enter the prom.

372
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,400
Oh, this?

373
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,810
I don't want to be the odd one out.

374
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:45,620
And it looks like I came for the prom.

375
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:03,780
For the past few days, I was trying to discover

376
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:08,360
what made me fall for you.

377
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,500
But I couldn't find it.

378
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:18,630
But whatever the reason is,

379
00:32:18,630 --> 00:32:21,040
I don't care anymore.

380
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,620
I just love you.

381
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,160
I love you, too.

382
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,939
What was that?

383
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:52,740
You want it one more time?

384
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,840
I am so happy.

385
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,240
Really?

386
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:10,630
Yeah,

387
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:13,790
and it's thanks to you.

388
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,860
Liar!

389
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:29,600
Let's be together for a long, long time.

390
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,900
So, are we together?

391
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,540
Yeah.

392
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:42,539
Don't disappear.

393
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,960
I won't.

394
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,620
- You said it.
- Yes.

395
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:51,200
If you disappear, I'll go find you at your place.

396
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,160
How are you here?

397
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,040
You invited me, remember?

398
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:18,800
So I came.

399
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,880
Are you feeling all right?

400
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,560
I would feel worse

401
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,640
if I didn't come tonight.

402
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,260
What are you doing?

403
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,660
Let's go outside.

404
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,650
There are too many people.

405
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:12,240
It's kind of uncomfortable.

406
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,460

Today's weather is good, right?

424
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:49,100
Don't you think so?

425
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:57,160
Yeah. That's true.

No matter how many times we've been here,

427

it still always feels the same. Don't you think?

428
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,260
Thanks.

429
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:28,040
For what?

430
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:33,340
Thanks for staying by my side.

431
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,080
Thank you, too.

432
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,660
I am sorry about the other day.

433
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,960
I was still confused about how I felt.

434
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,480
But not anymore.

435
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,120
Are you afraid?

436
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:40,790
I'm not sure

437
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:43,020
if this will work out or not.

438
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:55,080
But it's worth giving a shot, I guess?

439
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,740
Can you give me a chance?

440
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:18,240
What do you mean?

441
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,240
Will you be my boyfriend?

442
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,720
I was waiting for a long time for you to say this.

443
00:41:54,697 --> 00:41:57,577
Why are you crying?

444
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:07,060
Thanks for not running away from me.

445
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,560
