Do you think he knows that his boyfriend in the game is actually me?

Actually, I knew it all along.

If you are scared like this all the time, how can you and Near be together?

Fah, are you hurt a lot?

Please get up...

11

You're the one who asked me out.

12
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:27,310
He's probably tired, so let's let him sleep first.

13
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,000
I got something for you.

Fah was holding onto this when the emergency rescue came.

00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,640
I think he wanted to give it to you.

16
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,660
It's all my fault.

You want to tell me something? I'm here to listen.

If you confessed to a person

and that person is unhappy about it,

217

what would you do?

218
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:16,210
Oh, so it was a love issue?

I thought you were struggling with something else.

220
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:27,930
Have you heard "to love is to give?"

221
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:33,340
Well, if you already gave that person what you had,

00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,870
I think that it's already good enough.

223

That person liking you back or not, that's up to that person.

But you still want that person to like you back, right?

Then keep fighting.

Do you think it'll work?

Well, it's going to take some time.

Sometimes, these things depend on some special "chances."

I'll go away. I'll disappear from your sight.

332
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,370
You sure you can handle it?

333
00:34:14,930 --> 00:34:16,509
Handle what?

334
00:34:16,509 --> 00:34:20,470
Are you sure that you...

335
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:24,430
are really okay with that?

336
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:37,050
Yeah.

337
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,810
But I'm not okay.

338
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:00,510
Now you're smiling.

339
00:35:23,710 --> 00:35:25,310
Hey!

340
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:32,050
You're awake?

341
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:39,610
How are you feeling? Does it hurt anywhere?

342
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:44,270
Calm down.

343
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,950
It hurts a little but it's fine.

344
00:35:55,150 --> 00:35:57,510
You want some water?

345
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,730
Just a second.

346
00:36:15,830 --> 00:36:17,790
Take it slow.

347
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:22,510
Drink slowly.

348
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,530
Want more?

349
00:36:40,370 --> 00:36:44,070
You hungry? Do you want to eat anything?

350
00:36:47,070 --> 00:36:48,960
No.

351
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:53,090
Just seeing you already makes me full.

352
00:36:54,350 --> 00:36:55,970
Yeah, right.

353
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,590
What's wrong?

354
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:11,590
I missed you.

355
00:37:12,790 --> 00:37:14,850
So, so much.

356
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:21,470
I was really scared.

357
00:37:25,510 --> 00:37:30,830
I thought I wouldn't be able to see you and talk to you again.

358
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,090
Well, I'm right here.

359
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:44,070
Don't be scared. I will always be here.

360
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,070
I want to play Jenga.

361
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:57,290
Let's play it at my place.

362
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,470
Sure.

[Next episode]
Did you get a date for prom?

369
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,509
Well, I was going to ask you to be my date.

370
00:38:45,509 --> 00:38:48,729
If you don't recover by then, I'll just not go to prom and stay with you.

371
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:49,670
How's he doing?

372
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,830
He still has to stay in the hospital for a while.

373
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,210
Is he going to make it for the prom night?

374
00:38:55,210 --> 00:39:01,069
Love can make one's life be fulfilling, at the same time, it can hurt them too.

375
00:39:01,069 --> 00:39:04,849
It can hurt so much that some of you may be scared of falling in love.

376
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,190
But I want all of you to know that.

377
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:12,590
The important thing to note is to follow what your heart says.
