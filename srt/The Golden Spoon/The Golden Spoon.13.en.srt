Seungcheon.

3
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:41,249
Hello, President Hwang.

4
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:44,419
My wife made some dumplings
for Taeyong's birthday.

5
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,503
You forgot them.

6
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,090
Here, Seungcheon.

7
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:10,278
Thank you for caring so much
about Taeyong.

8
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,280
Take care on your way back.

9
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,657
Taeyong, I need a moment with you.

10
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,910
Yes.

00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,877
Give it to me.

13
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,380
Be more careful with how you handle food.

14
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,262
Yes.

15
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,812
Father… I mean, the president will say
he'll go with a physical division.

16
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,939
Just say yes, for your sake.

17
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,065
Let's go, Seungcheon.

18
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,150
Yes, Dad.

EPISODE 13

21
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:14,509
Seungcheon, you're wearing
different clothes from earlier.

22
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,471
That can't be. You must have seen wrong.

23
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:19,681
Have I?

24
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,976
I keep getting forgetful these days.

25
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,980
Dad, I'm sorry. Please make
the other deliveries without me.

26
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,106
Something urgent came up.

27
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,482
-I'm sorry.
-What?

28
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:31,276
-Seungcheon.
-Sorry.

29
00:02:31,776 --> 00:02:32,986
Seungcheon!

30
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,697
Jeez.

31
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,991
He needs to eat his birthday meal.

32
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,161
Goodness.

33
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,831
-Wait a second, please.
-Yes?

34
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,792
Ms. Gong has something to tell you.

35
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,128
I see.

36
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:53,423
I've decided to go ahead
with the physical division.

37
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,348
I know what you think,
but this is better for the company.

38
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,601
I hope you understand.

39
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,104
My understanding doesn't matter.

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,732
Dosin Group is still

41
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:13,484
a dream company among job seekers.

42
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,862
Being a self-serving conglomerate,

43
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:17,780
isn't it embarrassing?

44
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:20,450
What?

45
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,827
I'm also a CEO.

46
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:26,497
I'll think about what kind of decision

47
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,585
I can make for the sake of my company.

48
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:39,594
Also, you keep tapping your fingers.

49
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,304
Will you stop that?

50
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,681
It's very annoying.

51
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,292
Did I have a death wish?

52
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,128
Why did I do that to Father?

53
00:04:29,644 --> 00:04:31,187
-You're still here.
-Oh, yes.

54
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,148
Ms. Gong made an additional order.

55
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,400
I see.

56
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:37,610
Let me help you.

57
00:04:37,694 --> 00:04:38,903
It's okay.

58
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,490
Young masters shouldn't do such a thing.

59
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:47,328
Don't call your son's friend
a young master, Mr…

60
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,330
Mr. Lee.

61
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,583
I heard you and Seungcheon have
the same birthday.

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,794
Happy birthday.

63
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,088
Thank you, Father.

64
00:04:58,548 --> 00:04:59,382
What?

65
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:04,304
It's awkward
to call my friend's father, "Mr. Lee."

66
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,975
Oh, right. You're right about that.

67
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,729
I'll be going then.

68
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,355
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

69
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:39,714
Sir, why aren't you
getting ready to go to work?

70
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,676
-To work?
-You called an emergency meeting.

71
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:44,927
I did?

72
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,156
Excuse me. Have you seen
an old female street merchant here?

73
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,699
-No.
-No, we haven't.

74
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,744
Excuse me. Have you seen an old lady here?

75
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,287
-No.
-Thank you.

76
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,291
Sir, have you seen an old lady here?

77
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,422
Seungcheon!

78
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:26,219
Mom.

79
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,889
What are you doing here?

80
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,766
You went to deliver with your dad.

81
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,852
Something came up.

82
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,270
Anyway,

83
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,899
-what about you?
-Ah.

84
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,110
I'm coming from the mill.

85
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:44,195
I'll make susupat-tteok for your birthday.

86
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,948
It's known to bring you
health and longevity.

87
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,283
I'm not a little kid anymore.

88
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,160
Right.

89
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,247
Doing this won't change anything,

90
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:58,835
but it will ease my mind to make them.

91
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,504
It relieves me to think
that my son would be healthy

92
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,881
and well for another year.

93
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:09,387
Why do this much for your undeserving son?

94
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,640
Seungcheon.

95
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,393
Give it to me.

96
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,812
What's wrong with him?

97
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,230
Son.

98
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,066
Son, wait for me.

99
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,110
Give it back to me.

100
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,075
I must be weird

101
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:34,120
to think that Taeyong is Seungcheon.

102
00:07:35,121 --> 00:07:36,456
I must be.

103
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,167
Juhee!

104
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,169
Mr. Lee!

105
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,511
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

106
00:07:50,595 --> 00:07:53,055
It's been a long time.

107
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,809
Juhee.

108
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:01,063
Thank you for celebrating
Seungcheon's birthday with us every year.

109
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,356
Don't mention it.

110
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:06,027
I get to enjoy his mother's
seaweed soup thanks to it.

111
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,862
-That's delicious.
-Right.

112
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,032
But we might have to eat
without the birthday boy.

113
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,534
He seems to be
up to something urgent today.

114
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:16,329
-What is it about?
-I'm not sure.

115
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,761
-The passcode is…
-Oh.

116
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,722
Did you see it?

117
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,349
But it's a secret.

118
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:39,936
It's my kids' birthdays combined
in reverse order.

119
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:43,481
We haven't changed it for years
because it's a hassle.

120
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:44,774
We need a new one.

121
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,985
Mr. Lee, I don't think
I can join you today. I'm sorry.

122
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,112
Juhee!

123
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:54,700
Juhee!

124
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,923
Dosin Tower, please.

125
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,008
-Compensate!
-Compensate!

126
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,093
-Compensate!
-Compensate!

127
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:14,095
Who benefits from this division?

128
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:15,846
The executives must wake up!

129
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,598
Wake up! Wake up!

130
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:19,392
Absolute no to the physical division.

131
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,687
Mr. Hwang, why the sudden change of mind?

132
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:24,647
Was this your father's decision?

133
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,151
Are you taking back your
opposition against the physical division?

134
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,237
-Let's go.
-Please say a word.

135
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,196
A word, please.

136
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,327
Where do you think you're going, bastard?

137
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,247
Compensate!

138
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,582
Compensate! Compensate!

139
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,625
Give us our money back!

140
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,836
The executives must wake up!

141
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,546
Are you okay?

142
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,133
-I'm okay.
-Let's go.

143
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:54,844
Wake up! Wake up!

144
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:55,886
Compensate!

145
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,648
Oh Yeojin, what are you doing here
this early in the morning?

146
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,859
To give you a birthday gift.

147
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:13,904
How could you leave me alone
in that hotel room?

148
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,448
What do you take me for?

149
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,783
Did you even think of how I'd feel?

150
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:20,494
A hotel room?

151
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:22,872
With you?

152
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,833
Why would I go to a hotel room with you?

153
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,961
Don't you remember?

154
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:32,673
Are you kidding me?
I'd never go to such a place with you.

155
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:38,929
Hold on.

156
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,391
I did.

157
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:45,269
I did go.

158
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,022
Am I insane? Why did I do that?

159
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,191
Hwang Taeyong?

160
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,859
What?

161
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,903
You're Taeyong, aren't you?

162
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:02,244

00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:29,438
What are you waiting for?
Make a wish and blow out the candles.

169
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,198
There.

170
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:45,955
Happy birthday. Gosh, I'm hungry.

171
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,123
Let's dig in. It looks good.

172
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,750
Seungcheon, what did you wish for?

173
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,545
-What?
-You have to tell us

174
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:54,004
so we can get you a birthday gift.

175
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:57,091
Wait. This jacket looks new.

176
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:58,509
You got it as a gift?

177
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,929
It feels so real.

178
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,223
You know it's not.

179
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:16,318
Seungcheon.

180
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,448
I told you to stay home.
Why did you come back?

181
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,033
-Mom.
-What?

182
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,453
Isn't that cardigan
from when I was a senior in high school?

183
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:29,290
I'm not sure.
Did I buy it when you were a senior?

184
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,250
No, way before then.

185
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:35,087
You bought it at Yeongdeungpo
Market when I was in ninth grade.

186
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:36,714
Did I?

187
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,257
I'm right.

188
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,469
That table is from a long time ago, right?

189
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,515
These dishes too.

190
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,017
The television, the fridge, and all.

191
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,646
Everything's from a long time ago.

192
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:54,315
You already knew this.

193
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:57,109
When I painted that,
you said it was better than a new one.

194
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,070
Not at all for me. I like new ones.

195
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:01,447
I hate being shabby.

196
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,240
I hate it.

197
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,826
Just finish your food and go to work.

198
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:07,578
-Okay.
-Mmm.

199
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,790
Seungcheon, eat up.

200
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:12,374
Have some seaweed soup.

201
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,880
Mom, I need to go to the bathroom.

202
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,226
OH YEOJIN

203
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,856
-Hello?
-Happy birthday.

204
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,525
Should I congratulate you
on going back to being Lee Seungcheon too?

205
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:21,485
How did you know?

206
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,279
I met Taeyong, and he seemed strange.

207
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:25,656
Did you run into your parents today?

208
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:27,825
Is that why you got switched?

209
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,618
Yes, but it's strange.

210
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,705
Taeyong ran into President Hwang too,

211
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,748
but we didn't get switched.

212
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,377
No way. Unless they're not related,
that can't…

213
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:44,133
President Hwang
isn't Taeyong's biological father?

214
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:48,929
That doesn't matter.

215
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:51,682
Will you live as Lee Seungcheon
from now on?

216
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:53,976
Isn't there any way to go back
to being Hwang Taeyong?

217
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,144
That's what I want…

218
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,522
That's what I want to ask.

219
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,190
Don't you know anything?

220
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,067
No.

221
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,153
Nothing.

222
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,404
This is a punishment.

223
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,408
You're being punished
for what you did to me yesterday.

224
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,929
Seungcheon, what did you wish for?

225
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,099
My wish…

226
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,616
Let me be Hwang Taeyong again.

227
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,452
LEE SEUNGCHEON

228
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,580
How can he go back to being Hwang Taeyong?

229
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:04,838
Juhee?

230
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,341
What are you doing here?

231
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,222
-Same reason why you're here.
-What?

232
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,391
Today is Taeyong's birthday.

233
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:16,850
Aren't you here for that?

234
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,397
Oh, well… Right.

235
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,983
I'll be going then. See you around.

236
00:16:32,574 --> 00:16:34,827
Who does she think she is
to celebrate Taeyong's birthday?

237
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,464
Taeyong.

238
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,800
Hi, Juhee.

239
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:56,015
Do you have a minute?

240
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,226
Oh, I'm sorry.
I have to attend a meeting now.

241
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:00,728
Is it important?

242
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,647
No, it's fine. We can talk later.

243
00:17:03,731 --> 00:17:06,316
Sorry, let's do that.
I'm a little busy today.

244
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:11,321
-Taeyong.
-Yes?

245
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:12,906
I have

246
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:16,410
too much to tell you,

247
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,831
but I must tell you this at least.

248
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,879
Happy birthday, Taeyong.

249
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:41,101
I sincerely wish you

250
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:44,313
a happy birthday, my friend.

251
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,918
Happy birthday.

252
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,753
Bring us some glasses.

253
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,254
Ah.

254
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:13,717
I've prepared your childhood favorite.

255
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:15,594
Since today's your birthday,

256
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,721
here you go.

257
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,891
Enjoy this and cheer up.

258
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,148
STRONG MAN
CHEESE

259
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,864
Beer in the morning?

260
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,243
I give respect to the friendship
of you three jobless boys.

261
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,621
We have a reason to.

262
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,164
Well, have a good day.

263
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,124
Bye.

264
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,294
Make sure you wash the dishes
before you leave.

265
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:50,337
-Okay.
-Thanks for this.

266
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,091
What's this about?

267
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:55,551
What's wrong with him?

268
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:59,263
He sold half his shares
on Dosin Hightech's short selling.

269
00:18:59,346 --> 00:19:02,349
Hwang Taeyong, that damn bastard.
I'm going to kill him!

270
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:10,774
Due to the physical division,

271
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,695
our stock price went down by 18%.

272
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,072
Come up with a way
to stop the short selling.

273
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,074
Why must we do that?

274
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:22,578
Individual investors may criticize us,
but it'll only last a few days.

275
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,788
Please don't mind it.

276
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:29,877
The shareholders are suffering damage.

277
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,629
But I don't have to mind it?

278
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,304
This company doesn't belong to me and you.

279
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,140
It belongs to those protesting outside.

280
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,268
The people that worked hard
to buy each share.

281
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,062
Do you understand?

282
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,779
Who said a company belonged
to individual investors?

283
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:02,117
Hey, it belongs to its shareholders
even if it's just one share.

284
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,454
They can voice their opinions
as the rightful owners.

285
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,375
Shareholders own shares, not the company.

286
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:13,587
They sell their shares
when the price rises or falls.

287
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,423
Day traders aren't rightful owners.

288
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,592
They have zero affection toward companies.

289
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:23,513
You sound like you're the CEO.

290
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,891
Are you saying
Hwang Taeyong did the right thing?

291
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,643
He lied about the equity spinoff

292
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:29,436
and went on with the physical division.

293
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,063
He must have had his reasons.

294
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:33,523
And you must take that much risk.

295
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:36,610
The company had a division issue
in the first place.

296
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:40,197
Damn, I can't stand this.

297
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,827
Right, I'm the idiot who believed

298
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,497
that Hwang Taeyong would purchase
and retire the treasury shares.

299
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,083
But you're my friend, Lee Seungcheon.

300
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,168
Why would you say such a thing?

301
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,462
It's as if you're Hwang Taeyong!

302
00:20:57,214 --> 00:21:00,092
Hey, Jaedon.

303
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,720
Jeez.

304
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:08,976
Jaedon lost more than
ten million won today.

305
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:11,853
Still, he came here with beer
to celebrate your birthday.

306
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:14,648
Why did you have to defend
Hwang Taeyong there?

307
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,359
Goodness.

308
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,278
Happy birthday.

309
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,288
I can't believe those people
think so little of individual investors.

310
00:21:34,084 --> 00:21:37,087
-You sound like a different man today.
-Do I?

311
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:51,643
Munki, did I bump
the back of my head before today?

312
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,063
I'm not sure. Does it hurt a lot?

313
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,148
No.

314
00:21:57,899 --> 00:21:59,067
Was it a dream?

315
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,362
How's the short-selling going?

316
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:04,823
Amikus is behind it.

317
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,450
And Seo Juntae seems to be its center.

318
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,660
Uncle is?

319
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,627
It serves you right, moron.

320
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,838
You shouldn't have acted up.

321
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,382
Look who's talking.

322
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:30,265
Are you out of your mind?
Why would you go for short selling here?

323
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:33,060
Just what are you thinking?

324
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,063
I can't sleep at night because of you.

325
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:41,735
Everything's going to be
all right, Youngshin.

326
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,323
Don't worry.

327
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:49,034
How can I not…

328
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:55,415
Did Hyeondo offer to help?

329
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,424
I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.

330
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,762
You should pretend
to not know anything too.

331
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,433
Of course. He hates it
when someone breaks a promise.

332
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:17,270
I'll keep it a secret. Of course, I will.

333
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,315
What a relief.

334
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:24,986
Hyeondo, I didn't kill President Na.

335
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,742
It's true I went to see him
regarding the takeover of UBS.

336
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,285
But I didn't even get to meet him.

337
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,335
PRESIDENT NA SANGGUK

338
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:52,848
What's going on?

339
00:23:57,394 --> 00:24:00,480
That's when I got captured
on the dashcam footage. It's true.

340
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,357
I know.

341
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,904
But back in the States,

342
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,115
you killed them.

343
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:18,748
And you framed my son for it.

344
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,794
Had I known about it sooner,

345
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:25,881
I would never have handed you

346
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,383
Taeyong's shares.

347
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,677
What do you plan to do about me?

348
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:43,190
It's the gun you used in the States.

349
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:47,652
It still has your fingerprints on it.

350
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,989
No way.

351
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:53,658
It can't be.

352
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,245
You got rid of it.

353
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:58,622
I can get rid of the evidence

354
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,790
and make it appear again.

355
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,585
There's nothing I can't do.

356
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:07,255
Right?

357
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,303
TURN YOURSELF IN

358
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,723
Bear with it a little,
and I'll bail you out

359
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:18,350
-for lack of evidence.
-Hyeondo!

360
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,060
Will you rot in a US prison until you die?

361
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:23,063
Or will you turn yourself in
for killing President Na? Make a choice.

362
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,733
Which one do you think is better?

363
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,242
This is better.

364
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:37,702
This sure is.

365
00:25:39,162 --> 00:25:40,497
Hey, you.

366
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,375
I heard you killed Na Sangguk.

367
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,796
I had some grudges against that guy.

368
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,465
Anyway, thanks.

369
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:53,593
I'll treat you one day.

370
00:26:03,311 --> 00:26:04,271
What on earth?

371
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,441
Who is this Oh Dongpil,
and why does he want to see me?

372
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,779
You are…

373
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:17,033
What's your relationship with my Yeojin?

374
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,996
Who are you to take money
from her, you bastard?

375
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,123
Speak!

376
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,833
You bastard. Tell me now!

377
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:27,794
-What do you have to do with her?
-Stop it.

378
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,462
DOSIN HIGHTECH'S STOCK PRICE DROPS
DUE TO SHORT-SELLING

379
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,631
The company must be a mess.

380
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,553
Isn't there any way to go back?

381
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,233
-Seungcheon.
-Juhee?

382
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,484
Get in.

383
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,783
-Fasten your seat belt.
-Okay.

384
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,746
-Where are we going?
-Where you wanted to go. The sea.

385
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:05,457
-The sea?
-Off we go!

386
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,759
It's the sea.

387
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,271
-Are you that excited?
-Yes.

388
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,814
The weather is wonderful, isn't it?

389
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,066
Tell me about it.

390
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,841
President Hwang
isn't Taeyong's biological father?

391
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,722
Then who is his father?

392
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,516
A Cottage On an Isle?

393
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:05,975
Uh…

394
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:07,268
Want me to play it for you?

395
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,381
What brings you here?

396
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,302
I just wanted to have some tea with you.

397
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,597
You're really good.

398
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,144
You never learned how to play?

399
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:52,313
I've played it since I was five.

400
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,692
My mom who passed away

401
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,278
was so harsh at teaching me.

402
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,698
That evil old woman.

403
00:29:03,324 --> 00:29:05,326
I always wanted to quit.

404
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,539
"I'll quit after this competition."

405
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,333
"I'll quit once I enter college."

406
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,129
"Once I get married…"

407
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:21,301
But you still play the piano.

408
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,810
Guess what?

409
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,314
People tend to make a living

410
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:35,899
with the first thing they learned.

411
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,986
So it matters what you do at first.

412
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:45,116
It could be driving

413
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,952
or selling goods.

414
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,872
If you start with stealing,

415
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:53,041
you'll steal for the rest of your life.

416
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,134
Nara, come and eat whenever you want.

417
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:16,648
No.

418
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:19,484
I disagree.

419
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,861
People can change.

420
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:23,738
Regardless of how they started out,

421
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,158
they can change their lives as they want.

422
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,369
Yes,

423
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:32,539
you might be right.

424
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,004
Actually, it's also what my mom told me.

425
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:44,759
I wish my mean mom was wrong,
and you are proven right.

426
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,221
I mean it.

427
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:52,976
I have a question.

428
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,817
What was Taeyong's real mom like?

429
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:05,196
Was she also mean?

430
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,616
I'm not sure.

431
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:12,662
But one thing is for sure.

432
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,291
She was crazy.

433
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,753
A lunatic.

434
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,181
She had an affair
with the president's friend.

435
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,517
And died throwing a fit
because he wouldn't divorce her.

436
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,228
Taeyong probably

437
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,231
takes after her cheating nature.

438
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:43,651
You'd better beware

439
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,863
of Na Juhee.

440
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,367
What an unnecessary concern.

441
00:31:56,831 --> 00:32:00,084
That friend might be
Taeyong's biological father.

442
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,223
OH YEOJIN

443
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,068
Don't, Juhee.

444
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:30,114
Come on. We came all the way here.
We've got to take pictures.

445
00:32:30,198 --> 00:32:31,616
I don't take pictures.

446
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:33,743
I don't like leaving behind
stuff like that.

447
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:36,829
What are you talking about?
Pictures are all we're left with.

448
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,374
Here. One, two, three.

449
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:41,626
I'll take some for you.

450
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,797
One, two, three.

451
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:51,135
Let's take some together.

452
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,187
They came out well.

453
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:09,862
The weather's better than
when we went to Sokcho, right?

454
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,447
Sokcho?

455
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,117
Remember when we went there

456
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,869
and had so much fried chicken and shrimp?

457
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:20,540
Yes, I remember.

458
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,046
This place is nice too, right?

459
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,340
Yes, it's nice.

460
00:33:29,841 --> 00:33:32,760
I mean, this is much better.

461
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,564
We've never been to Sokcho together.

462
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,988
You've never said
you wanted to go to the sea.

463
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,035
-Yeojin--
-That doesn't matter.

464
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,870
Will you live as Lee Seungcheon
from now on?

465
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,289
Isn't there any way to go back
to being Hwang Taeyong?

466
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,046
I can't believe it.

467
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,969
She even went to Sokcho
with Hwang Taeyong.

468
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,097
I guess she went around a lot with him.

469
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,475
Are you

470
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,352
really Seungcheon?

471
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,691
Are you back to being Lee Seungcheon?

472
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,863
But why did she go to such places with him
when they aren't even dating?

473
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,627
Seungcheon, I'll buy you ice cream.

474
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,338
And what do you want to have for lunch?

475
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,298
Just name it. I'll buy you anything.

476
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,468
All of a sudden? You're scaring me.

477
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,261
It's your birthday.

478
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,932
I don't think I have ever
properly celebrated your birthday

479
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:03,476
for the past ten years.

480
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,438
I want to make up for it all today.

481
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:12,318
-Juhee.
-Let's go get ice cream.

482
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,486
Juhee.

483
00:35:14,362 --> 00:35:15,947
Thanks for your offer,

484
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:20,034
but I'm buying.

485
00:35:20,409 --> 00:35:21,244
Hey.

486
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,329
Hey, Lee Seungcheon!

487
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,831
You're throwing it?

488
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,208
Did you just throw your shoe at me?

489
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,627
Come over here.

490
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,505
-Why don't I just throw this into the sea?
-Hey!

491
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:35,716
No, don't.

492
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,052
You'll stop, right? Here.

493
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,473
Hey, Na Juhee.

494
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,642
Come over here.

495
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,313
Hey!

496
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:55,194
Hey!

497
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,243
Put me down!

498
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:14,463
Happy birthday, sir.

499
00:36:14,547 --> 00:36:15,882
Thank you.

500
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,718
You know the show will air today, right?

501
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,554
Thank you so much for your trouble.

502
00:36:21,637 --> 00:36:23,848
Ms. Wang has something to tell you.

503
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:25,892
Wang.

504
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:29,854
Let me apologize first.

505
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,316
I cussed you out so much,
saying you were the worst dirtbag.

506
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,902
Ah.

507
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:39,113
But now that I've spent time with you,
I've realized you are nice.

508
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:41,741
I told you so.

509
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,869
He's not like any other wealthy person
you can think of.

510
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:47,622
-I'll have to wait and see about that.
-Fine.

511
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:50,208
This special is about start-ups,

512
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,500
but we cover many other topics

513
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,752
like embezzlement,

514
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,420
illegal inheritance, and back-scratching.

515
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,964
I hope we don't have to meet again

516
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,674
regarding such corrupt issues.

517
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,011
I'll keep that in mind.

518
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:06,891
Didn't Juhee come with you today?

519
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,435
She took the day off
to attend to business.

520
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,312
-I see.
-Business, my foot.

521
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:14,065
She borrowed Ms. Wang's car

522
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,566
to go on a trip with Lee Seungcheon.

523
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,029
With Lee Seungcheon?

524
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:23,115
The number you have dialed…

525
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:28,120
Why won't he pick up?

526
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,041
HWANG TAEYONG

527
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:36,963
Hi, Taeyong.

528
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:38,339
What's up?

529
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:40,967
Juhee went to the sea with Lee Seungcheon.

530
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,094
What?

531
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:47,139
I want to ask her why
and tell her to come back immediately,

532
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:52,144
but it's not my place
as someone who's engaged.

533
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,106
Speaking of which,

534
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:58,651
I can't marry you.

535
00:37:58,734 --> 00:38:02,029
Wait, Hwang Taeyong.

536
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:04,699
That's not your decision to make.

537
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,534
Why not?

538
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,203
Anyway, just know that
I'm not marrying you.

539
00:38:16,335 --> 00:38:18,713
Lee Seungcheon went to the sea?

540
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:23,259
That's why he didn't answer my calls.

541
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,363
What's got you lost in thought?

542
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:49,452
I just feel confused.

543
00:38:51,787 --> 00:38:54,373
I wonder if it's okay
to be doing this here.

544
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,631
Your life has been too busy.

545
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,842
You've pushed yourself too hard

546
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:09,263
that you feel anxious
you might end up being a nobody

547
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,765
if you don't do anything.

548
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,770
Once, my dad told me

549
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:19,106
that I was a nobody without the title
of Na Sangguk's daughter.

550
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,818
It turned out to be true.

551
00:39:23,819 --> 00:39:27,198
When he passed away
and I was left penniless and alone,

552
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,659
I felt like I was a nobody.

553
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:35,873
But Seungcheon.

554
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,712
My dad was wrong.

555
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,048
It is important who your parents are,

556
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:47,927
what kind of car you drive,
and what kind of house you live in.

557
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:50,888
But what matters more

558
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,308
is who you are and whom you're with.

559
00:39:57,686 --> 00:39:59,855
Why are you suddenly telling me this?

560
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,445
I lied to you.

561
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:10,491
You never said
you wanted to go to the sea.

562
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,577
I've never been to Sokcho with you.

563
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,454
This is the first time

564
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,915
we came to the sea together.

565
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:22,128
I was the one who wanted to come.

566
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:27,842
I wanted to come to this sea with you.

567
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,303
Not with Taeyong,
but with you, Seungcheon.

568
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,769
What are you talking about, Juhee?

569
00:40:39,812 --> 00:40:41,480
I don't understand.

570
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:43,607
Seungcheon.

571
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:47,153
I found out everything
about your situation.

572
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:49,947
-But Seungcheon--
-I said I don't understand!

573
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:52,783
Stop telling me this.

574
00:40:54,410 --> 00:40:55,703
I don't want to hear it anymore.

575
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,922
-Seungcheon?
-You.

576
00:41:48,923 --> 00:41:50,716
Why did you bring me here
when you knew it all?

577
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,636
Why did you do this to me?

578
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:59,350
Right, I'm Lee Seungcheon.

579
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:00,976
To become Hwang Taeyong,

580
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:03,270
I abandoned my parents and you.
I'm that Lee Seungcheon!

581
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:08,067
Why didn't you just swear at me?

582
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:11,737
You should have blamed me
and gotten mad at me instead!

583
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,949
Why did you…

584
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,920
I missed you.

585
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:35,219
I missed you, Seungcheon.

586
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:57,992
Are you…

587
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,661
Seungcheon?

588
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:14,216
I'm so happy

589
00:43:15,426 --> 00:43:16,635
to meet you again.

590
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,783
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

591
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:46,749
Wait.

592
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,129
-It's not here.
-What are you looking for?

593
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:55,341
Hello, sir.

594
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,724
I saw this at an exhibition
when I was in college.

595
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,685
Then I saw it again here.

596
00:44:06,769 --> 00:44:10,314
Since then, I've really wanted
to have these pencils.

597
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:14,068
Of course, a carpenter
shouldn't blame his tools,

598
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,071
but truth be told,
tools are important. Right, sir?

599
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:21,450
It's been my life's dream
to draw with such well-made pencils.

600
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,576
Oh.

601
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,119
They smell wonderful.

602
00:44:27,122 --> 00:44:28,874
Did you know that

603
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,711
graphite and diamond
are actually of the same element?

604
00:44:32,795 --> 00:44:34,046
I see.

605
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:38,050
Depending on the given environment,
it can turn into graphite like this

606
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,343
or become a diamond.

607
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,260
Mm.

608
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,513
Whether it's an object or a person,

609
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:45,557
it's good to be with someone
who appreciates their value.

610
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:47,101
That's what I'm saying.

611
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,560
Please take them.

612
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,983
Goodness, no.

613
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,694
That's outrageous.

614
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,946
It may be valuable to you,

615
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,949
but it's only a decorative item to me.

616
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,535
Please don't decline and take it.

617
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:08,789
Gosh, no.

618
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:11,834
I can't accept something this expensive.

619
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:19,091
Take it. It's a token of my heart.

620
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,181
Sir, then…

621
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,100
I know it's shameless of me,

622
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,979
but I'll take it with gratitude.

623
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,153
Thank you so much.

624
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,587
You told me

625
00:45:57,838 --> 00:45:59,173
that poverty wasn't contagious.

626
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,508
But you probably didn't know

627
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,885
that wealth

628
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:07,598
could easily infect people like this.

629
00:46:10,851 --> 00:46:12,686
You couldn't achieve your dream…

630
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:15,981
because of…

631
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:20,068
money, after all.

632
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,490
You have lost…

633
00:46:27,451 --> 00:46:28,744
to this money.

634
00:46:30,537 --> 00:46:32,122
Although you might hate to admit it.

635
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,959
Sir…

636
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,670
I can buy anything.

637
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,340
Your dream, your wife's side dishes,

638
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:44,051
and even your precious son.

639
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:49,640
Did your son tell you
that he came to see me?

640
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,936
I suggested he work with Taeyong,

641
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,563
and his eyes sparkled.

642
00:46:58,106 --> 00:47:01,235
He has to settle
for being a fragile graphite with you,

643
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:04,029
but he can become a diamond with me.

644
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,739
He knows it.

645
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,284
Watch…

646
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,122
Watch what you say.

647
00:47:17,376 --> 00:47:19,044
My son isn't like that.

648
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,171
He came to me.

649
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,466
That means your son

650
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,386
was infected by my money too.

651
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,099
Just like you right now.

652
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,269
Yes,

653
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:38,856
I understand.

654
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,035
I didn't know

655
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:37,998
you could be this cheap, petty,

656
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,083
and heartless.

657
00:48:41,627 --> 00:48:44,379
Are you satisfied to take revenge on him
with some pencils?

658
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,133
I just taught him the truth.

659
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:50,427
That dreams require money.

660
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,431
And how much he loves money

661
00:48:54,514 --> 00:48:57,517
unlike his noble attitude.

662
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:03,190
Do you know what your truth is?

663
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:13,075
That without money,

664
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,828
no one will choose to be with you.

665
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,343
What's this? You're not even welcoming me.

666
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:37,516
What's with the long face?

667
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:39,434
Did something happen?

668
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,647
Taeyong hurt your feelings again,
didn't he?

669
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,360
I wonder why he doesn't like me.

670
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,444
Hey.

671
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,447
It's not easy to have feelings
for a brat like you.

672
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:56,410
Then why do you like me?

673
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,083
Your first love.

674
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,211
That's me, right?

675
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:10,966
Isn't that why you always
follow me around to help me?

676
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:14,094
Because you like me.

677
00:50:17,764 --> 00:50:19,016
Yes, I like you.

678
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:22,352
More than anyone else in the world.

679
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:26,356
Park Janggun, wake up.

680
00:50:27,441 --> 00:50:29,693
I will never like you back,

681
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,072
so give up on your
hopeless one-sided love.

682
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:38,702
Hey, Oh Yeojin.

683
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,080
Do you have to be that mean?

684
00:50:42,164 --> 00:50:43,665
You asked me why I like you?

685
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,418
Because you're pretty?
Because it was love at first sight?

686
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,546
Right, when I was younger.

687
00:50:50,338 --> 00:50:53,884
But now, I like you out of pity.

688
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:56,219
You act like you have it all,

689
00:50:56,303 --> 00:50:59,056
but you still somehow seem hungry.

690
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,392
You're like a kid
who wants to keep eating.

691
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,562
You're desperately greedy

692
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,731
over a man who doesn't even like you.

693
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,610
I feel so bad for you.

694
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:13,320
That's enough.

695
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,571
Wake up.

696
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:17,032
No matter how much you try,

697
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:20,202
-Hwang Taeyong won't like you.
-Why you…

698
00:51:22,204 --> 00:51:23,080
Tell me if I'm wrong.

699
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:26,458
He likes Na Juhee.

700
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,838
Yeojin.

701
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:33,965
How could you…

702
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:38,386
Park Janggun,
how could you say that to me?

703
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:42,808
I'm never going to see you again.
I want you out of my life.

704
00:51:43,517 --> 00:51:44,726
Yeojin.

705
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:46,603
Darn it.

706
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,439
Yeojin. Oh Yeojin!

707
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:54,236
Oh Yeojin.

708
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:55,779
Yeojin!

709
00:51:56,947 --> 00:51:58,490
Give me your car keys.

710
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,117
You're too worked up to drive safely.

711
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,660
Forget it and let go.

712
00:52:04,663 --> 00:52:07,457
I'll take you to your
beloved Hwang Taeyong,

713
00:52:08,333 --> 00:52:09,292
so give me the keys.

714
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,752
Stay out of it.

715
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,754
I'm not going to him.

716
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,174
Oh Yeojin, you really…

717
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,896
Lee Seungcheon.

718
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:33,900
I don't care what you do
or where you are with Na Juhee.

719
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:38,780
Just apologize, and I'll forgive you.

720
00:52:39,906 --> 00:52:41,366
I'll forgive you for everything.

721
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,638
Thanks for today, Juhee.

722
00:53:06,433 --> 00:53:08,685
Seungcheon, it's so amazing

723
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:12,105
that I could sense it was you

724
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,442
even when you were Hwang Taeyong.

725
00:53:15,525 --> 00:53:16,943
I'm so amazed.

726
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,947
God must have listened to my prayer.

727
00:53:22,908 --> 00:53:26,578
Back when we went
to church together, I prayed

728
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,998
that you'd recognize me
even when I looked different

729
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,043
or had a different name.

730
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:17,045
I'm so pathetic.

731
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,505
What's so great about that thing?

732
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:21,800
Why did I accept it so easily?

733
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,135
That was so immature of me.

734
00:54:24,219 --> 00:54:26,930
How pathetic.

735
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,975
Knock it off!

736
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,769
You didn't do anything wrong!

737
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:37,691
That Hwang Hyeondo is unbelievable.

738
00:54:40,777 --> 00:54:43,238
Honey, what are you doing?

739
00:54:43,321 --> 00:54:44,614
So what if he's a president?

740
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,409
I can't stand what he said to my husband!

741
00:54:48,326 --> 00:54:50,120
I'm going to go teach him a lesson.

742
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:52,330
Honey, calm down.

743
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,124
Let go. Don't stop me.

744
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,419
No, don't! Just stop already!

745
00:55:06,511 --> 00:55:07,721
What are you doing?

746
00:55:09,723 --> 00:55:10,557
Honey!

747
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,518
Go spend all this money.

748
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:15,687
Have a drink with your friends
or go shopping.

749
00:55:15,770 --> 00:55:17,564
Spend it all until you feel better.

750
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,651
Have as much fun as you want,
and get over what happened.

751
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:22,861
Seonhye.

752
00:55:22,944 --> 00:55:24,863
Make sure you spend every penny of it.

753
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,365
Or I won't stay still.

754
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:29,617
Now go.

755
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,754
SUCCESS AFTER SUCCESS
SIDE DISH STORE

756
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,434
Mr. Lee.

757
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:56,978
Hi, Yeojin.

758
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,647
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

759
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,192
-Have you had dinner?
-What?

760
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:06,321
If you haven't,
I'd like to treat you to it.

761
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,739
Would that be all right?

762
00:57:23,648 --> 00:57:25,191
These aren't my memories.

763
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:28,403
They're Taeyong's.

764
00:57:43,084 --> 00:57:45,545
Juhee, what do I do?

765
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,096
I'm not Hwang Taeyong,

766
00:57:58,766 --> 00:58:00,643
but I don't feel like
I'm Lee Seungcheon either.

767
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:14,282
How should I tell Father

768
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,286
that I won't marry Yeojin?

769
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,958
Why should I care?
I should just tell him so.

770
00:58:54,989 --> 00:58:56,616
Munki!

771
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,745
Where's my father?

772
00:59:00,828 --> 00:59:03,998
It's unusual
that you called me at this hour.

773
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,501
I had some thoughts to organize.

774
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:10,588
You've said that you go to museums
in those times.

775
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:12,757
That's right.

776
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,509
When you have a lot on your mind,

777
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:17,804
it helps to stay in the time of the dead.

778
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:49,836
There is so much that I must do.

779
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:52,505
But there's much more that I want to do.

780
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:56,301
That's how I was able
to endure the hard times.

781
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:58,469
-Let's say time turned back.
-So all this…

782
00:59:58,553 --> 01:00:00,221
-What would you do?
-…was Seungcheon?

783
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,348
In any situation,

784
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,476
I will never give up on what I want.

785
01:00:11,232 --> 01:00:12,650
I don't take pictures.

786
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:15,153
I don't like leaving behind
stuff like that.

787
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,988
Could he have meant…

788
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:31,336
Sir.

789
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,212
Munki.

790
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:36,966
President Na collapsing…

791
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,094
I remember that scene.

792
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,891
You mean the day he passed away?

793
01:00:46,392 --> 01:00:48,269
Then what about the shooting incident?

794
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,157
That…

795
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,994
That was Uncle Juntae.

796
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:07,622
Those kids, you killed them.

797
01:01:07,705 --> 01:01:09,832
President Na was mistaken.

798
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:12,335
But that wasn't all.

799
01:01:12,919 --> 01:01:14,170
There was more.

800
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:16,714
I'm sure of it.

801
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,802
Sir?

802
01:01:24,639 --> 01:01:26,474
I know you despise my father!

803
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,644
But still, how could you lie
and say that I'm a murderer?

804
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,273
Lying is your father's specialty,
not mine.

805
01:01:35,191 --> 01:01:37,193
Do you want to know something else?

806
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,994
Aren't you curious
about your father's secret?

807
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:51,666
Hwang Hyeondo's secret
that no one knows about.

808
01:01:57,463 --> 01:01:58,673
I don't believe you.

809
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,843
You're too scared to believe me.

810
01:02:02,343 --> 01:02:03,386
You are scared

811
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:07,682
to know what kind of person
your father, Hwang Hyeondo, is.

812
01:02:08,433 --> 01:02:11,018
Stop, that's enough!

813
01:02:21,571 --> 01:02:24,115
Aren't you curious
about your father's secret?

814
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:31,205
President Na.

815
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:39,839
President Na.

816
01:02:40,339 --> 01:02:42,633
It's me, Taeyong.
Why aren't you answering?

817
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:45,970
President Na.

818
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:53,519
President Na?

819
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:44,070
No way.

820
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:49,033
What's wrong? Sir!

821
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:52,870
Munki.

822
01:03:53,496 --> 01:03:54,997
Do me a favor.

823
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:08,386
Juhee.

824
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:12,974
Why did you suddenly want
to meet me again?

825
01:04:14,642 --> 01:04:15,768
This is the place, right?

826
01:04:16,352 --> 01:04:17,854
Where the golden spoon granny was.

827
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,108
Come to think of it,

828
01:04:23,025 --> 01:04:25,236
I've met her before.

829
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:56,475
Isn't she the one who asked me to deliver
her letter to you on your birthday?

830
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,398
And I remembered

831
01:05:03,274 --> 01:05:06,027
the rules of the golden spoon
written in your notebook.

832
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,195
A month, a year,

833
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:10,197
and ten years.

834
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,912
You have three chances
to choose your parents.

835
01:05:16,495 --> 01:05:19,790
Your last chance,
there isn't much time left, right?

836
01:05:24,170 --> 01:05:25,588
I'm asking you, Seungcheon.

837
01:05:26,464 --> 01:05:28,299
Please don't become Hwang Taeyong.

838
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:57,328
I don't know what you have in mind, but I…

839
01:06:06,253 --> 01:06:08,881
What's wrong? Juhee.

840
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:10,508
Hwang Taeyong?

841
01:06:15,429 --> 01:06:18,224
I'm sure I was with Seungcheon.

842
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,435
What are you doing here?

843
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,890
What? Do you want to become rich too?

844
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:05,688
Take a look at this one.

845
01:07:05,771 --> 01:07:07,898
This golden spoon

846
01:07:08,774 --> 01:07:11,610
can make you become rich
by swapping your parents.

847
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:13,237
What do you say?

848
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,997
Don't you want to become rich?

849
01:07:26,167 --> 01:07:28,461
I will buy this golden spoon.

850
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,337
All right.

851
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,191
Hyeondo.

852
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:58,282
In the end, you've lost.

853
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,517
THE GOLDEN SPOON

854
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:27,353
I wonder who my biological father is…

855
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,438
I'm glad you're back in your place.

856
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:30,606
Let's break up.

857
01:08:30,689 --> 01:08:32,149
I won't let you go.

858
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:34,527
I've already started
the preparations for your succession.

859
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:37,113
He will never go back
to being the poor Lee Seungcheon.

860
01:08:37,196 --> 01:08:39,865
Are you aware of what you just did?

861
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,451
I want you to come back
to being Lee Seungcheon.

862
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:45,412
What does it feel like
to live with a golden spoon in your mouth?

863
01:08:45,496 --> 01:08:47,206
I'm going to kill Hwang Hyeondo.

864
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:48,499
Seungcheon.

865
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:49,625
Dad?
