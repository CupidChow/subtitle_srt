1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,157
Dad!

2
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:35,035
Dad, please wake up. Dad.

3
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,120
Dad!

4
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,163
Dad…

5
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,415
Dad.

6
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,792
Are you a family member? Then get in.

7
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,586
-Why the hell would you get in there?
-Geumseok.

8
00:00:44,669 --> 00:00:46,671
I'm his eldest son. I'll get in.

9
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,631
Move.

10
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,093
Dad!

11
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,554
Dad! Dad! Dad…

12
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,181
Dad!

13
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,642
Dad! Dad!

14
00:01:00,143 --> 00:01:01,144
Dad.

15
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,188
Dad.

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,856
Dad.

17
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,525
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE
KCSI

18
00:01:14,032 --> 00:01:14,991
Spread out.

19
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,914
Check every nook and cranny.
Don't miss anything.

20
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,207
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

21
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,875
-The corner over there too.
-Yes, sir.

22
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,635
Hey, check inside there.

23
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:24,144

24
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,605
Last night, President Na Sangguk of UBS TV
was found dead,

25
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:28,815
which has shocked the public.

26
00:02:28,898 --> 00:02:30,650
As there's no trace of forced entry,

27
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,235
it's highly assumed to be an accident,

28
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:36,364
but the police are open
to the possibility of homicide as well.

29
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,659
President Na was struggling
with financial difficulties

30
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,202
due to excessive business expansion.

31
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:42,745
And UBS TV, the core of--

32
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,334
There's no need to worry.

33
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,170
They'll conclude
that he died of a heart attack.

34
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:51,796
Handle it carefully until the end.

35
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:55,049
-Don't leave any issues.
-Yes, sir.

36
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:06,352
I told you to rest at home.
Where have you been?

37
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,395
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,940
I heard President Na passed away.

39
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:14,944
Why would this happen?

40
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,781
Don't you remember our chat this morning?

41
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,951
I'm sorry?

42
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:28,833
I did hear that you stopped
taking your meds.

43
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,377
But it seems your condition has worsened.

44
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,796
Otherwise, how can you be…

45
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:39,469
I don't know, I feel like such a fool.

46
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,766
I can't even remember
what happened this morning.

47
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,310
I'm sorry.

48
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,073
It's all right.

49
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:04,118
You probably don't remember
because there's no need to.

50
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,752
You're my son, and for you,

51
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,380
I will do anything.

52
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,718
You just have to remember that.

53
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:39,529
It's strange.

54
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,992
You lose your memory
only when it's unfavorable for you.

55
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:47,745
It sure is not an easy thing to do, is it?

56
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:55,878
Your misunderstanding
is quite upsetting, Mother.

57
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,631
I'm misunderstanding?

58
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,886
I heard you were carried home
drunk last night.

59
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,639
Did you think I'd be clueless
just because your father covered it up?

60
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:11,978
Why? You don't remember again?

61
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,982
Then again, I expected you wouldn't.

62
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,535
He had a drink?

63
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,997
Did something happen to Hwang Taeyong?

64
00:06:11,537 --> 00:06:15,750
Why do they want me to burn
such an expensive jacket? What a waste.

65
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,379
I should just follow orders.

66
00:06:38,564 --> 00:06:41,192
Long time no see.

67
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:44,112
You left as if you'd never come back.

68
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,281
What? Did you want
to become rich that bad?

69
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,535
It's none of your business.

70
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:13,850
Granny?

71
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,521
You see,

72
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:22,400
gold melts at approximately
1,000 degrees Celsius.

73
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:27,738
But what about dirt that's entwined

74
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,198
with a lot of other stuff?

75
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:33,202
Would 1,000 degrees Celsius be enough

76
00:07:33,744 --> 00:07:34,996
to melt it?

77
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:38,791
Why are you suddenly telling me this?

78
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,586
One day,

79
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:43,880
you will be reminded of what I just said.

80
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,593
I wonder why she told me that.

81
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,358
I'm sorry, sir. It's all my fault.

82
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,202
Where did you go, leaving Taeyong alone?

83
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,623
Munki, find Reporter Lee Chulseung
from New Jersey Times for me.

84
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,082
I took a moment

85
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,252
to meet a friend.

86
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,429
A friend?

87
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,266
When you were 15,

88
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,811
you left the orphanage
to start working for my family.

89
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:43,356
You've never let me down since.

90
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,609
So I forgave you regarding
Lee Seungcheon's apartment issue.

91
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:50,488
I wonder why you made
another mistake yesterday.

92
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,908
I apologize.

93
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:58,704
When you're given a chance,
cherish it as if it's your last.

94
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,666
Always remember who signs your paycheck.

95
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,797
If it wasn't for Taeyong's late mother,

96
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,883
you wouldn't be here now.

97
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,387
I know how much you care for Taeyong.

98
00:09:19,058 --> 00:09:20,101
But I won't

99
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:23,896
forgive you three times.

100
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:43,958
It doesn't make sense.

101
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,836
I can't believe

102
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:49,130
Dad passed away like this.

103
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:51,257
Oh, please!

104
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,179
Hey. This is enough, you brat.

105
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,347
Don't you even get tired?

106
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:01,350
We even got an autopsy done
because you wanted it.

107
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:07,690
It was just his time.

108
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:12,194
There's no one who would have killed Dad!

109
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,697
Damn it.

110
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:17,867
Still, something feels odd.

111
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,703
No matter how much I think about it,

112
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:23,539
it feels strange.

113
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,597
Hanju Group President Oh Jaewoong's…

114
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,848
secretary.

115
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:45,019
TKM Group President
Tak Soonchul's secretary.

116
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:48,230
Strategy and Finance
Minister Kim Dongpyung's secretary.

117
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:52,151
None of them are worthy.
We shouldn't have come.

118
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:54,820
Who would care to visit
a family going broke?

119
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:58,532
So you should live well.
Don't make me experience this.

120
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,369
Of course not. I won't let that happen.

121
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,330
I'll start building up goodwill
for your sake, sweetie.

122
00:11:05,122 --> 00:11:06,123
Mr. Oh.

123
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,126
Work on making money instead.

124
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,672
If I inherit a lot of money,
I won't be miserable like them.

125
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:14,256
I want money. A lot of it.

126
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,178
That brat has a way
of hurting other people's feelings.

127
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,013
Wait for me, Yeojin.

128
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,240
Then kneel.

129
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,633
Congratulations on your return
to Hwang Taeyong.

130
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:02,388
Aren't you embarrassed to say
what you don't even mean?

131
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,224
I mean it.

132
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:09,145
On the day you used the golden spoon,
I went to Hwang Taeyong's,

133
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,397
I mean, your house to be the first
to congratulate you.

134
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,069
Young master! Where are you going?

135
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,155
Young master!

136
00:12:37,047 --> 00:12:38,007
Lee Seungcheon.

137
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,302
You should be grateful to me.

138
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:42,720
Why should I?

139
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,013
You wouldn't know.

140
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,807
You can pay me back later.

141
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,185
After I get an answer to my question.

142
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,737
My question is…

143
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,453
Why did you want to kill yourself,
Hwang Taeyong?

144
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:34,855
Juhee.

145
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,364
Are you here alone?

146
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:46,408
-What?
-What about your father?

147
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,954
Is he not coming?

148
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,500
He's busy today.
I don't think he can make it.

149
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,796
I see.

150
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:04,301
Still, I thought he'd come
to say his last goodbye to my dad.

151
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:06,136
Juhee.

152
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:13,936
Seungcheon.

153
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,604
Juhee.

154
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,990
Juhee, it's all right.

155
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:30,744
It's okay.

156
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:40,462
What did you say, you bastard?

157
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,047
This is all because of you!

158
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,091
What? What?

159
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:45,968
Say that again!

160
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,095
So what if you're the older one?

161
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:49,889
Why did you hand over your shares
to Juntae?

162
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,725
I didn't know
Dad would pass away this early!

163
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,895
-Just drop it.
-Let's have him buy our shares too.

164
00:14:55,978 --> 00:14:57,897
We'll sell at a high price.

165
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,357
-Damn it.
-Knock it off, you guys.

166
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:04,153
Must you talk about money
at Dad's funeral?

167
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:09,199
-How dare you butt in on our conversation?
-I beg you. Please stop.

168
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,619
Don't you even feel sorry for Dad?

169
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,038
Can't you just grieve at least for today?

170
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:15,915
And you call yourselves human?

171
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,000
Why you little…

172
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:23,547
Aren't you the older one? You're going
to hit her because she was right?

173
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:24,757
Seungcheon.

174
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,843
Who are you?

175
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:30,804
Who am I?

176
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,974
How dare you not know me?

177
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:35,726
I am…

178
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:40,147
I am…

179
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,610
That's not your business.

180
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,738
Hey, Hwang Taeyong.
Isn't Seo Juntae your uncle?

181
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,907
Why don't you say something?

182
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,954
Hwang Taeyong…

183
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:58,248
REST AREA FUNERAL HALL

184
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,173
Check how Uncle Juntae got the money
to buy their shares.

185
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,093
It's probably not from your father.

186
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,596
A large company can't have more than
10% of a broadcasting company's shares.

187
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,640
That means he has other means.

188
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,392
Look who it is.

189
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,726
Hello, Taeyong.

190
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,355
Don't you remember me?

191
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,439
I'm Yeojin's dad.

192
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,817
I remember.

193
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,236
-I thought so.
-How can I not?

194
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:28,696
What?

195
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,199
Huh.

196
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:35,369
Why that punk…

197
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,291
Munki, I need you to do one more thing.

198
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,669
Hurry and get the car ready.

199
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:51,093
NATIONAL TAX SERVICE

200
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:00,936
TAX INVOICE

201
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,895
BUSINESS LICENSE

202
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,857
TITLE: OH CONSTRUCTION'S TAX EVASION
AND ACCOUNTING FRAUD

203
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,861
MATERIALS ABOUT PRESIDENT OH'S TAX EVASION
AND ACCOUNTING FRAUD FROM 2007 TO 2011

204
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,621
Juhee's got such horrible older brothers.

205
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,125
Poor Juhee.

206
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,382
Why does my head hurt so much?

207
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,426
Did I bump into something?

208
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,100
Mmm.

209
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,606
"Dosin."

210
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,318
"Dosin."

211
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,904
"Dosin."

212
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,032
How annoying.
Everything around me is from Dosin.

213
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,495
Hey, Seungcheon!

214
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,915
You can't eat these.

215
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:04,666
Cherries are really expensive.

216
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,959
Why not?

217
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:08,295
Do you want my mom to kick you out?

218
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,005
How many did you eat?

219
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:11,256
-One--
-Goodness gracious.

220
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,842
You heartless brat.

221
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,803
Let your friend eat what he wants.

222
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:21,266
Seungcheon, eat up.

223
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,935
Eat as much as you want.

224
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:26,688
How could you make such a fuss
just because a customer touched your butt?

225
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:30,025
If you can't even handle that,
why don't you just quit?

226
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,986
Why don't you quit then?

227
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,656
Director!

228
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:40,869
If I quit, how will you deal
with all the customers' bookings?

229
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,457
Sungah, you take over. Isn't it time
you became an official designer?

230
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,127
Me?

231
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,963
You, Ms. Lee, will take appointments
from tomorrow on.

232
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,257
Please work hard, Ms. Lee.

233
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,768
Congratulations, Sungah.

234
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:07,146
Thank you. Thank you.

235
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:10,399
A webtoon company
really reached out to you?

236
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:11,733
I'm telling you.

237
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,111
They saw my webtoon
in the Best Challenge section.

238
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:17,072
What if they suggest
I officially serialize it?

239
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,532
Oh, my.

240
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:20,534
Isn't it great?

241
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,869
I'm so happy for you.

242
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,454
Seonhye, you asked
if I could lend you money, right?

243
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:28,709
This is ten million won. Use it to get
a house and tell me if you need more.

244
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,919
-What?
-Ma'am.

245
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,379
Thank you, ma'am.

246
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:34,464
What on earth?

247
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,552
Thank you so much, ma'am!

248
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,970
Don't mention it.

249
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,639
Oh, my goodness.

250
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:46,894
Wow!

251
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,317
Mom, Dad.

252
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,028
Wait for me.

253
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,487
I'll come back with 10 billion,

254
00:19:58,197 --> 00:20:00,449
no, 100 billion won.

255
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:09,666
NATIONAL TAX SERVICE

256
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,177
Damn it.

257
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,389
Who was it?

258
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,476
Just who tipped me off to the NTS?

259
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:31,480
It was Hwang Taeyong. I'm sure it was him.

260
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:32,940
Why would he?

261
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:34,483
What does he have against me?

262
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,194
And how would he know
about my tax evasion and accounting fraud?

263
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:40,697
He must've heard and seen things,
going in and out of our house for a year.

264
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:45,911
Did Hwang Taeyong come by
that often? When?

265
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:58,131
I will take care of it,
so don't do anything, all right?

266
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,634
Damn it.

267
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,427
Goodness.

268
00:21:04,554 --> 00:21:07,933
HWANG TAEYONG

269
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,774
What the hell, Lee Seungcheon?

270
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,067
Did you just hang up on me?

271
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,237
HWANG TAEYONG

272
00:21:21,697 --> 00:21:24,449
OH YEOJIN

273
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,635
Hey, Munki.

274
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,474
-Let me pour you a drink.
-Thank you.

275
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:55,939
Young master.

276
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,276
I really don't understand

277
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:02,237
why you're going the extra mile
to help Lee Seungcheon's family.

278
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,740
I think you've helped them enough already.

279
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,665
You know what?

280
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:15,709
I…

281
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,296
became Hwang Taeyong

282
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,716
to help Lee Seungcheon.

283
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,803
Excuse me?

284
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,892
I was joking.

285
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:34,519
Right. So you found out
where Uncle Juntae got the money?

286
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:43,487
"Golden Money Investment."

287
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,533
Alex Boo. His Korean name is Boo Youngsoo.

288
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:52,329
He was a legendary fund manager
on Wall Street.

289
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,041
Currently, he runs a private equity fund
named Golden Money Investment.

290
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:18,688
Ah.

291
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:20,107
There he is.

292
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:48,176
KIMCHI STEW 3000, STIRFRIED PORK 3000
HOME MEAL 2000

293
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,219
ALWAYS 2000

294
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,601
-What else do you need?
-You only sell home meals.

295
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,353
Why do you always ask?

296
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,731
I could get you a fried egg for free
if I like your answer.

297
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,567
Is that right?

298
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:06,194
Then I want steamed eggs.

299
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,904
My goodness.

300
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,739
Wait.

301
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:12,200
Take one more for the lady in the kitchen.

302
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:15,454
-Goodness, thank you.
-Wait just a second.

303
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,456
Oh, my.

304
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,250
Thank you. This is great.

305
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,835
I see you carry a lot of cash.

306
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,796
Money is best spent in the form of cash.

307
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:30,302
It's not fun to swipe a credit card.

308
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,888
You do know that they're thanking
your money, not you, right?

309
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:39,436
I'll let it slide this time
since you're young.

310
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,814
So, heir apparent of Dosin Group.

311
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,066
Did you ask to see me to act arrogant?

312
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:48,153
You are only tolerating
my arrogant behavior because of money.

313
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,614
The money that my father has.

314
00:24:50,697 --> 00:24:52,991
I see you like money talk.
We'll have a lot to talk about.

315
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,951
Why are you here?

316
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,415
Seo Juntae is my uncle.

317
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,002
I heard you funded
his purchase of UBS TV shares.

318
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:08,507
Will you choose to side with big money
or small money?

319
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:12,385
What? I don't understand
what you're talking about.

320
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,556
I'm only telling you to think about which
choice will bring you more money later.

321
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:20,519
Whether to side with Hwang Hyeondo's son
or his brother-in-law.

322
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,529
You'll take over UBS TV?

323
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,865
I told you that I'd surprise you.

324
00:25:34,407 --> 00:25:36,576
I wanted to show you what I could do

325
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:39,204
solely on my own.

326
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,833
Just how high are you planning to climb?

327
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,169
As high as you'll allow me.

328
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:47,462
It won't be easy.

329
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,215
I hate easy tasks. They're not fun.

330
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,762
Finish up with UBS TV.

331
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,430
I'll commend you then.

332
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:11,111
I'm with the president right now.
Let's talk later.

333
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:16,908
What? Alex Boo withdrew his money?

334
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:38,013
Thanks for the food, Hwang Hyeondo Junior.

335
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:39,389
My name is Hwang Taeyong.

336
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,099
You're his son. That's all I need to know.

337
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:44,185
You should remember it
if you want to make big money.

338
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,486
Don't make me regret
choosing Hwang Taeyong,

339
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,155
not Hwang Hyeondo's son.

340
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,466
A 2,000-won meal and a high-end sedan…

341
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,787
Miss Juhee.

342
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,335
I sent all the staff away.

343
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,672
Thank you for everything.

344
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:57,842
It's your severance pay.

345
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,844
You didn't have to…

346
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:10,438
Hey, is this all you're giving me?

347
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,483
-Excuse me?
-This is too little

348
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:15,318
considering how long I've worked here.

349
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,029
You are just like your cheapskate dad!

350
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,240
Ms. Kim…

351
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:22,867
Why? You feel offended
to hear me talk down to you?

352
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:25,328
I don't work here anymore.

353
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,540
You enjoyed a lavish lifestyle
thanks to your rich father.

354
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:32,293
You're going to struggle quite a bit.

355
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,255
Cooking, cleaning,
and doing the laundry yourself.

356
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,631
It's going to get bitter.

357
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,509
But do you even know
how to use a washing machine?

358
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:42,679
Then again, it's none of my business.

359
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,267
Wait, Ms. Kim.

360
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,061
Did you not see anything

361
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,856
on the day my dad died?

362
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,490
That day, you didn't see our young master.

363
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,416
No.

364
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,844
Let me ask you one thing.

365
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,054
I heard you met Alex Boo

366
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,640
and told him not to invest in Juntae.

367
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,021
When you reported

368
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,690
Oh Construction to the NTS,

369
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,151
I feigned ignorance.

370
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,611
But about Juntae,

371
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:43,490
why are you going this far?

372
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,123
Because I'm your son.

373
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,251
UBS TV.

374
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,629
Is it worth taking over
with someone else's help?

375
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,466
Someone else?

376
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,762
How can you say that about your uncle?

377
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:06,721
Ah.

378
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:09,182
It might be uncomfortable
for you to hear this.

379
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,602
But Uncle is a collateral relative.

380
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,855
It's a fact that he's not
of the lineal family.

381
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:18,608
What are your grounds
for saying it's not worthy?

382
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,906
Uncle probably thought of taking it over
because of its debt ratio

383
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,282
and operating profits.

384
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:28,993
But if he'd considered our reputation,

385
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,703
he should take it slow instead.

386
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,833
Rumor says that
President Na's sudden financial problem

387
00:30:34,916 --> 00:30:37,126
was because of you.

388
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,212
Acquiring it right away in this situation?

389
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:45,677
Will it help
with Dosin's global reputation?

390
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,778
Hwang Taeyong, this punk.
How dare he challenge me?

391
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,702
Taeyong has been quiet for a while,
but he's acting weird again.

392
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:13,204
Again?

393
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:16,374
I told you last year.

394
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:19,502
That he paid unusual attention
to IPOs and the shareholders' meetings.

395
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,422
But this time, he was brought home drunk.

396
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,756
What's weird about it?

397
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,638
According to Ms. Gong,

398
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:33,933
Attorney Ko told the staff
to burn everything Taeyong was wearing.

399
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:35,810
Why was that necessary?

400
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,604
Don't you think it's odd?

401
00:31:37,687 --> 00:31:40,106
So, did they burn the clothes?

402
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,399
Yes, it seems so.

403
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,360
Huh.

404
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,071
That is pretty suspicious.

405
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,913
I'm sorry I couldn't attend the funeral.

406
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,207
It must've been hard on you.

407
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,503
I bet it still feels surreal,

408
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,256
but time will resolve everything.

409
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,550
President Hwang, I have a favor to ask.

410
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,303
The police say it was an accident,
but I don't believe it.

411
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:15,350
With your help, I can reveal
what's behind my dad's death.

412
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,226
Please help me.

413
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:19,145
Are you saying you can't trust the police?

414
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,647
-That's not it--
-Then what is it?

415
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,360
Then Juhee,

416
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:29,697
do you think your father was evil enough

417
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,616
to be killed by someone?

418
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,748
You're still so immature.

419
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:41,459
Your father was an admirable man.

420
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:45,129
Look what's happening to his companies.

421
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:49,217
Don't you think it's less humiliating
for him that he passed away?

422
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,513
I called you in for the times
I shared with President Na and you.

423
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,223
I guess it was wrong of me.

424
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:02,772
Take this with you.

425
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:13,449
I guess I really am immature.

426
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,708
Thank you for the gesture.

427
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,067
CASHIER'S CHECK
ONE BILLION WON

428
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:51,404
President Na, your daughter
still has a long way to go.

429
00:33:56,909 --> 00:33:58,745
Are you planning to destroy my family?

430
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,164
My dad's about to go crazy
because of the tax inspection,

431
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,416
the police investigation,
and next week's articles.

432
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,877
Lee Seungcheon,
how could you do this to me?

433
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,254
Think of what your father did to my mom.

434
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,672
This is nothing compared to that.

435
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:12,550
And I'm not indebted to you.

436
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,344
Yes, you are.

437
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,930
If I hadn't stopped Hwang Taeyong
from killing himself,

438
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,640
you wouldn't be here right now.

439
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,435
He tried to kill himself? Why?

440
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:24,854
That's not important.

441
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:29,233
What's important is that I saved his life.

442
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,943
I'm sorry, but I don't care.

443
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:35,073
Be thankful that your father
is finally learning how to run a business.

444
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:45,249
Good going.

445
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,752
Getting slapped by a girl.

446
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,921
I found all the videos
of the dates you mentioned.

447
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,130
Thank you.

448
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,308
He was brought home drunk,
but why wasn't he captured on camera?

449
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:10,858
Mm?

450
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:20,368
It was overlaid.

451
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:26,415
This means
they're definitely hiding something.

452
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:50,439
Then Juhee, do you think
your father was evil enough

453
00:35:51,274 --> 00:35:52,900
to be killed by someone?

454
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,060
Dad.

455
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:32,106
Dad…

456
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:45,077
I couldn't believe that you died.

457
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:48,331
Mom's gone,

458
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,627
and you left me too.

459
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,213
I just couldn't believe it.

460
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,091
I didn't even know you were suffering.

461
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,677
I'm so sorry.

462
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:06,724
What are you feeling
so sorry for that you're crying like this?

463
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,069
-Dad?
-Don't cry, you brat.

464
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:22,615
Your brows furrow when you cry.
It's not pretty at all.

465
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,076
Smile. You're pretty when you smile.

466
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,705
Dad.

467
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,208
Dad.

468
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:33,709
Dad!

469
00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:40,174
Dad…

470
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:51,227
Dad…

471
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:17,503
Let's go.

472
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,588
Okay.

473
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,094
I have it all prepared,
so you don't need to worry about a thing.

474
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,178
Okay.

475
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,231
I told you to come with a lawyer,
not this moron.

476
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,151
That's fancy coming from a lowlife
who slaps his sister.

477
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,319
I didn't slap her.

478
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:44,864
Geumseok, Alex Boo is coming soon.
Let's end it quickly.

479
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,535
Hey you, just sign this and leave.

480
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,706
Here you go.

481
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,552
INHERITANCE WAIVER

482
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:10,014
"Will not file a suit to restore
the legal reserve of inheritance,

483
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:11,891
nor make an objection?"

484
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:15,061
It means you won't file a suit
regarding your given inheritance.

485
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,647
I guess you sneaked something away
pretty quickly.

486
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:24,945
Juhee, it means your brothers
took all the useful property.

487
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:27,865
And they want you to not complain.

488
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,577
-Right?
-Who are you to butt in here?

489
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:35,206
Juhee, if you don't sign it,
I won't let you spend a penny.

490
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:37,917
I'll block your bank accounts,
credit cards, and everything.

491
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,834
It's a total lie.

492
00:39:39,418 --> 00:39:42,046
Juhee, your brothers
are the ones in a rush, not you.

493
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,049
I know the top tax attorneys
in the country.

494
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,217
Leave this up to me.

495
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,262
These right here
are the top tax attorneys.

496
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,722
And you're a nobody.

497
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,226
Park Haekyu, Kim Gunwook, Heo Injae?

498
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:57,603
I've never heard of these names.

499
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,899
I've never heard of these names.

500
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,861
The top tax attorneys in the country

501
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,280
are Park Jinchul who won the yen swap case

502
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:11,283
and Oh Seungho who resolved
Handong Group's succession conflict.

503
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,622
Both are partners
at North Pacific Law Firm.

504
00:40:16,997 --> 00:40:17,957
North Pacific?

505
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,419
Juhee, let's go.

506
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,711
What? Okay.

507
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:28,551
Brothers.

508
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:32,847
I get that you are determined
not to leave anything to Juhee.

509
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:34,598
But this is not right.

510
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:36,892
Let's play fair, all right?

511
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,104
-Let's go, Juhee.
-Mm.

512
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:49,196
-It's "South" Pacific, not "North."
-Jeez.

513
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,115
Aren't you glad I came with you?

514
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,784
I knew they'd talk about money.

515
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,077
Thanks, Seungcheon.

516
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,789
By the way, how do you know
so much about attorneys?

517
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,332
I don't know.

518
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:04,336
Probably because they're famous.

519
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,007
It's unexpected to see this side of you.

520
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,843
I mean, I was surprised when you bluffed.

521
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,219
I wasn't bluffing.

522
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,349
Juhee, for you and my mom,

523
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,351
I can do anything.

524
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:21,770
Aren't you hungry?

525
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:23,564
Let's go have tteokbokki. It's on me.

526
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,316
Should we?

527
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,031
What's wrong?

528
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,118
This is real.

529
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:39,038
It's an authentic piece
by "Hyewon" Shin Yoonbok.

530
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:40,831
No way.

531
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:44,043
How can a restaurant like this have
an authentic piece by Shin Yoonbok?

532
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:45,544
He's right.

533
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,511
This painting belongs to me.

534
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:55,930
But how did you know it was real?

535
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,642
Shin Yoonbok

536
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,686
had a unique habit
when signing his pieces.

537
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:06,023
Do you see
the Chinese character for heart?

538
00:42:06,106 --> 00:42:08,817
It's supposed to have two dots,
but he wrote it in one stroke.

539
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:10,194
And most of all,

540
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:12,821
my gut feeling tells me so.

541
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,162
-Let's go, Juhee.
-Okay.

542
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,122
Wait.

543
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:27,545
I put this painting up three years ago.

544
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:29,880
You're the first person who recognized it.

545
00:42:34,927 --> 00:42:36,679
Go have something delicious with this.

546
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:40,307
A 50,000-won bill?

547
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,892
What does he take us for?

548
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,310
Hey, mister.

549
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,022
I saw you had a lot of money.

550
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,024
Give us one more.

551
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:53,821
This isn't enough
to get something delicious.

552
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:57,116
Seungcheon, stop.

553
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,085
This one's a loan.
Will you be okay with that?

554
00:43:26,604 --> 00:43:28,814
This is my number. Call me.

555
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,238
Let's go, Juhee. The food is on me.

556
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:37,740
Seungcheon.

557
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,824
Lee Seungcheon.

558
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,869
Let's go.

559
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:45,706
"Lee Seungcheon?"

560
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:51,253
My goodness.

561
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:55,090
Hwang Taeyong, you want me
to do your hair?

562
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,345
Not me, but this guy.

563
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:01,263
Young master.

564
00:44:02,097 --> 00:44:04,725
I bought a pass for this salon
so I trust him to your hands.

565
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,728
-Young master, I--
-Your jacket, please.

566
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,855
What about your hair?

567
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,649
I know you hate me.

568
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,692
I can't be sure what you'll do to my hair.

569
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:15,444
So you aren't totally clueless.

570
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,612
Please store this.

571
00:44:17,196 --> 00:44:19,365
SUNGAH

572
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,412
It's my number.

573
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:27,498
Save it and tell me
when the pass fee runs out.

574
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:30,417
You can also call me
when you're hungry or something.

575
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,505
Take your time, Munki.
I'll be talking to the lawyer.

576
00:44:34,588 --> 00:44:35,506
Make him look good.

577
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,050
-Young master.
-Well…

578
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,844
How did he know my number?

579
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,221
Did he get it from Seungcheon?

580
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:45,891
He has a crush on me, doesn't he?

581
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,397
Just do my hair, please.

582
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,942
I'd like a neat style.

583
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:56,944
The side should be 1.5cm,

584
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,487
and the back should be 2cm.

585
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,864
-Don't thin it out, and the front--
-All right.

586
00:45:02,324 --> 00:45:03,575
You're so talkative.

587
00:45:06,036 --> 00:45:07,246
Excuse me.

588
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,126
Hi, Mom.

589
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,377
Tomorrow evening?

590
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,338
Dad and Seungcheon are coming too?

591
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:19,216
Okay, I'll see you at the diner.

592
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:20,467
Yes.

593
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,678
Are you craving anything?

594
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:26,974
Because I want to get you
something delicious.

595
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,102
Mom, I'm working now.

596
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,228
Okay, bye.

597
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:33,272
Sorry.

598
00:45:33,856 --> 00:45:36,984
So, the side should be 2cm,
and the back should be 1.5cm…

599
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,360
Tomorrow evening?

600
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:41,447
Okay, thanks.

601
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,325
Janggun, you can stop going there now.

602
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,206
Dad.

603
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,167
I have something to tell you.

604
00:45:58,005 --> 00:45:59,047
This.

605
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:02,926
And this.

606
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,720
This too.

607
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:07,431
My mom made all these.

608
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,475
She made them all herself?

609
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:21,278
Mmm. Hey, it's so good.

610
00:46:22,362 --> 00:46:25,282
Mmm. I wish we had some rice.

611
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:29,870
This is really good.

612
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,707
Mmm. Delicious.

613
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,792
Did you order something?

614
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,836
No, I didn't.

615
00:47:29,972 --> 00:47:31,098
Hwang Taeyong?

616
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:50,033
Mmm.

617
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:54,121
Mmm.

618
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,460
I like all your mom's side dishes,

619
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:02,671
but the jangjorim is the best.

620
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,635
You're so shameless.

621
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,013
Your uncle took over Juhee's company.

622
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:13,056
How can you be eating in her face?

623
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:25,527
So I looked
into what her brothers were up to.

624
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,529
My lawyers told me

625
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:31,617
that they sneaked away
all the useful assets to a corporation.

626
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:34,995
And that the actual debt
would be much bigger.

627
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,040
It must be why
they gave up the inheritance.

628
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,709
They gave up the inheritance?

629
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:45,797
President Na even took out a private loan
to resolve the financial problem.

630
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:47,674
Did you know?

631
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,387
Juhee, what you need to do

632
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,973
is give up on the inheritance.

633
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,684
I'm sorry, but that's the only way.

634
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:00,103
Excuse me for a moment.

635
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:10,530
You heartless bastard.

636
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,865
Why mention the private loan?

637
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,076
I told her
so she could decide objectively.

638
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,535
Hwang Taeyong, you're such a…

639
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,289
Forget it.

640
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,209
Juhee.

641
00:49:25,504 --> 00:49:26,505
I'll go.

642
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,299
No.

643
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:39,142
I'll let you win today

644
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,896
because she needs your power right now.

645
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,356
But next time,

646
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:47,693
stay away from Juhee.

647
00:50:36,575 --> 00:50:38,577
You'll have to file a suit
to claim your reserve.

648
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:43,081
And this house
is under your eldest brother's name.

649
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,916
You know he put it up for auction, right?

650
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,339
I'm sorry

651
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,925
that you have to hear this from me.

652
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,102
My dad

653
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,522
built this house for my mom.

654
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:12,527
And he planted this tree

655
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,906
in the year I was born.

656
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,078
This is where I was born,
and where I grew up.

657
00:51:23,163 --> 00:51:24,956
But I guess I'll have to move out.

658
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,255
Giving up on the inheritance

659
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:34,966
feels like I'll be giving up on my dad.

660
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:40,013
If I only have his debt to inherit,

661
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:50,232
I guess I have to give up
on all the memories too.

662
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,445
The memories were all money after all.

663
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,449
I didn't realize that.

664
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,247
Taeyong.

665
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,499
Do I have to thank you

666
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,168
for what you told me today?

667
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,173
-Juhee.
-But sorry. I can't do that.

668
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:16,883
Please leave.

669
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,898
Oh, my goodness.

670
00:53:12,981 --> 00:53:15,066
You startled me, you brat.

671
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,861
How long has it been, son?

672
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,238
Dad, I missed you.

673
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,865
I missed you too.

674
00:53:23,825 --> 00:53:26,119
What's with you? Sir!

675
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:28,121
Goodness.

676
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:31,374
Please, I need you to forgive me.

677
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,920
If you don't, my company will go down.

678
00:53:35,003 --> 00:53:37,631
Your company's bankruptcy
has nothing to do with me.

679
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,507
I beg you.

680
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:41,301
I'm sorry I dragged you to Gangneung

681
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,428
and suggested a night at a hotel
for 100 million won.

682
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,346
Mr. Oh.

683
00:53:44,429 --> 00:53:47,766
You were so pretty
that I lost my mind for a moment.

684
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,060
-So please forgive me.
-Goodness.

685
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:51,478
-I beg you.
-What…

686
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,979
-Mom! Move.
-Ms. Jin.

687
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,357
-How dare you…
-Seungcheon.

688
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,692
I'm going to teach you a lesson!

689
00:53:57,776 --> 00:53:59,319
-No, stop.
-What did you do to my mom?

690
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,071
Tell me!

691
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,740
Honey!

692
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:08,453
I'll give you 100 million won.

693
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,121
Lee, I know you need money

694
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:12,290
to pay for Seungcheon's tuition
and get a house.

695
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:13,458
Forget about the debt too.

696
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:16,211
I'll give you 100 million won,
so please let it slide, Lee.

697
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,255
No, Mr. Lee.

698
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,548
I don't need your money, you damn bastard.

699
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:22,509
-Dad.
-Honey.

700
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,389
Seungcheon.

701
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:35,939
-Sir!
-What?

702
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:36,856
You're bleeding!

703
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:38,400
Just start driving.

704
00:54:38,483 --> 00:54:39,484
-Yes, sir.
-Get out.

705
00:54:39,567 --> 00:54:40,819
-I said, out!
-Who are you?

706
00:54:40,902 --> 00:54:43,947
What in the world? You…

707
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:46,658
-Open the door!
-Open the door.

708
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:48,159
-Hey!
-Are you okay, sir?

709
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:50,370
-Open the door.
-You're dead meat!

710
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:54,958
-You…
-Sir!

711
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,502
Sir!

712
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,255
Sir!

713
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,804
-Hey!
-Let go!

714
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,181
Hey, watch out!

715
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,683
Good work today.

716
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:13,310
-Good work.
-Good work.

717
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:14,769
-Good work.
-Good work.

718
00:55:16,688 --> 00:55:17,981
Yeah, Mom. I'm leaving work now.

719
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,152
What? What are you talking about?

720
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:24,904
Seungcheon did what?

721
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,205
SUNGAH

722
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:37,292
SUNGAH

723
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,341
SUNGAH

724
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,097
It's been a long time
since we dined out together.

725
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,099
It's also been a long time
since I met the man

726
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,769
who's coming today.

727
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,646
Are we expecting someone?

728
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,316
He's my guest as well as yours today.

729
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:03,068
He owns this place too.

730
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:10,867
Hwang Taeyong, Seungcheon
kidnapped Mr. Oh. Please help.

731
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:17,957
Goodness, President Hwang.
Long time no see.

732
00:56:18,041 --> 00:56:19,626
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

733
00:56:20,126 --> 00:56:22,045
Say hello. Sir, this is my son--

734
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:25,048
I'm sorry, Father.
Something urgent came up. I'm sorry.

735
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,966
Taeyong.

736
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:35,767
Oh, dear.

737
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:42,941
Sungah, what happened?

738
00:56:43,024 --> 00:56:45,151
I don't know the details.

739
00:56:45,235 --> 00:56:47,487
It seems that lowlife Mr. Oh
wronged our mom in some way.

740
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:49,489
Seungcheon got mad because of it.

741
00:56:50,365 --> 00:56:52,409
I couldn't think of anyone but you.

742
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:54,786
I thought you could locate Seungcheon.

743
00:56:54,869 --> 00:56:57,288
Taeyong, please stop Seungcheon.

744
00:56:57,372 --> 00:57:00,291
Don't worry, I'll see what I can do.
So stay with Mom.

745
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,381
How did it go?

746
00:57:06,881 --> 00:57:08,216
I've located Mr. Oh's car.

747
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:09,342
Let's hurry there.

748
00:57:22,981 --> 00:57:24,190
Pull over…

749
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,944
Hey, drive a little slowly.

750
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,614
Hey! Turn on the blinker!

751
00:57:32,657 --> 00:57:35,827
Did you even get driving lessons?
You drive like a total novice.

752
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,829
You might get us both killed!

753
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:38,997
Don't make me laugh!

754
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,833
You can't die just yet.
This is only the beginning.

755
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,293
What?

756
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:47,672
You aren't going to kill me, are you?

757
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,383
Please spare me.

758
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:53,928
Please don't kill me…

759
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:56,014
Spare me, please.

760
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,815
Taeyong!

761
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,611
Thank you.

762
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:12,155
That punk and his dad beat me up
and kidnapped me.

763
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,656
I thought I was going to die.

764
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:17,035
Don't let go of him.
I'm going to make him pay the price.

765
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:19,245
I'll make him rot in prison.

766
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:24,125
That may be your case, Mr. Oh.

767
00:58:25,668 --> 00:58:27,045
What?

768
00:58:27,629 --> 00:58:28,630
Mr. Oh.

769
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,007
Listen to me carefully.

770
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:33,676
Nothing happened today.

771
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,846
You met neither Lee Seungcheon
nor his father.

772
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:40,642
You didn't get beaten up
nor did you get kidnapped.

773
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:45,146
No way. I can't tell such a lie!

774
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,940
You can't?

775
00:58:47,732 --> 00:58:49,817
That tax inspection
didn't teach you a lesson, did it?

776
00:58:49,901 --> 00:58:53,905
Must you get investigated
by the prosecutor's office?

777
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:58,159
For tax evasion, embezzlement,
fraud, and malpractice,

778
00:58:58,243 --> 00:58:59,953
do you want to be featured
on the front page?

779
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:03,206
Or will you end this
with a simple penalty tax?

780
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,130
I don't

781
00:59:12,674 --> 00:59:14,008
look good in pictures.

782
00:59:19,847 --> 00:59:21,808
I have a nosebleed,
but I didn't get beaten up.

783
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:34,487
Please give my brother-in-law
another chance.

784
00:59:35,154 --> 00:59:36,072
But why?

785
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:40,159
I really liked your son's arrogant guts.

786
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,328
That's why I'm asking you for this favor.

787
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,208
He needs to experience
losing what's his and regaining it.

788
00:59:47,292 --> 00:59:48,626
Ah.

789
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:52,547
You need me to go back on my word
to train your son.

790
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,634
Your brother-in-law
might be sad to hear this.

791
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:03,808
I'm okay with the idea,
but it's not so good for me.

792
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,519
Both your brother-in-law and son

793
01:00:07,562 --> 01:00:09,981
will think I'm a fickle man.

794
01:00:10,857 --> 01:00:14,569
I'll be indebted to you,
and that won't be so bad for you.

795
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:16,863
Indebted?

796
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:20,992
A lot of people are indebted to me,

797
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,120
but I'm indebted to no one.

798
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:25,705
I'm not trying to show off,

799
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,293
but I'm a man who returns a favor
with a bigger favor.

800
01:00:36,674 --> 01:00:39,677
Goodness,
you're making it hard to decline.

801
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,683
Fine, I'll do as you say.

802
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,859
Yes, Seungcheon.

803
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:59,030
I see. Rest up.

804
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,866
I'll call you tomorrow. Bye.

805
01:01:07,580 --> 01:01:08,790
What did he say?

806
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,793
Well,

807
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:15,338
he talked it out with Mr. Oh,
and they apologized to each other.

808
01:01:16,631 --> 01:01:17,590
I see.

809
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,304
It all went well.

810
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:25,306
I see.

811
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,941
Do you sleep there?

812
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,528
We better move soon. You must be cold.

813
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,327
-Honey.
-Yes?

814
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,249
I'm sorry.

815
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:57,171
I actually knew that Mr. Oh

816
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,133
had feelings for me.

817
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,887
I hoped it'd help our family

818
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:10,226
stay at his place for as long as we could.

819
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:15,106
Don't be sorry.

820
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:18,860
You did nothing wrong.
I should be sorry instead.

821
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:25,324
But actually…

822
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,498
when Mr. Oh offered 100 million won…

823
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:37,837
I wanted to take it.

824
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,012
I really wanted to take it.

825
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:51,100
If you and Seungcheon hadn't been there,

826
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:58,399
I would've taken the money. I wanted it.

827
01:03:00,485 --> 01:03:01,861
But you didn't.

828
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:04,697
That's what counts.

829
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,408
I'm so sorry.

830
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:11,037
I'm truly sorry, honey.

831
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:18,085
But I regret it.

832
01:03:21,923 --> 01:03:23,758
I wish I'd taken the money.

833
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,432
I regret it. I feel so bad

834
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:34,560
that I didn't take that 100 million.

835
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:56,791
Lee Seungcheon,
are you aware of what you did today?

836
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,751
You assaulted and even kidnapped him.

837
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,670
You would've been sent to prison
if not for me.

838
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:04,048
So what? Do you want me to thank you?

839
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:06,467
I'm telling you to wake up!

840
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,303
You don't know anything,
so stay out of it.

841
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,055
You don't even know what he did to my mom.

842
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:13,599
If she were your mom,

843
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:15,893
you'd punch him too.

844
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,271
No, if it were me…

845
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,232
Even if I were you, I'd never punch him.
Do you know why?

846
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:25,903
Because I have no money.

847
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,948
So if you have no money,
you have to put up with that?

848
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:31,033
-Is it a sin to not have money?
-It is!

849
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,995
It's the most miserable sin of them all!

850
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:37,623
If you're poor, you can't fight.

851
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,793
If someone hits you, you have to put up
with it no matter how unfair it is.

852
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,047
Because you would

853
01:04:45,548 --> 01:04:48,718
do anything for money.

854
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,809
If you don't, it becomes a debt.

855
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:01,022
It comes back to you as a debt.
That's what it's like for the poor.

856
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:07,737
So Seungcheon, if you care for your mom,

857
01:05:08,946 --> 01:05:10,323
don't cause any trouble.

858
01:05:14,201 --> 01:05:15,912
I get what you mean.

859
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:18,915
But I won't live like that.

860
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:23,085
-What?
-I'll do and say what I want.

861
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:26,172
I won't be a coward just because I'm poor.

862
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:30,968
You didn't understand what I said at all.

863
01:05:32,261 --> 01:05:35,681
So what were you going to do
after doing what you wanted?

864
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:40,811
I was going to kill him.

865
01:05:46,734 --> 01:05:47,777
I really

866
01:05:49,111 --> 01:05:50,279
wanted to kill him.

867
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,005
He committed suicide?

868
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:09,757
What do you mean?

869
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:13,302
Well, everyone says
President Na died of an accident,

870
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,763
but rumor says he committed suicide.

871
01:06:17,014 --> 01:06:20,142
There's no need to be so serious about it.

872
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:21,727
You're Mr. Smile.

873
01:06:24,563 --> 01:06:25,815
I told you not to call me that.

874
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,071
Okay.

875
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:37,326
Right. Juntae,
when will Taeyong join Amikus?

876
01:06:37,410 --> 01:06:39,578
-Everyone else is wondering.
-We don't need him.

877
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:43,582
The ace must join Amikus
to raise its class.

878
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:44,750
You said he listens to you.

879
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:46,752
Let's just go back
to what we were talking about.

880
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:49,005
Why would President Na kill himself?

881
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:53,634
That, I'm not sure.

882
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:57,054
People say he killed himself
because he couldn't marry Juhee off

883
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:58,472
to Taeyong.

884
01:06:58,556 --> 01:06:59,807
That's ridiculous.

885
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,351
President Na died because of Taeyong?

886
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,562
He died because of Taeyong…

887
01:07:08,566 --> 01:07:10,693
Seongwon, let's have lunch another time.

888
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:14,155
Hey, Seo Juntae.

889
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:25,499
Youngsin, what time did you say
Taeyong came back drunk?

890
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:35,009
I managed to save the company
thanks to my dear daughter,

891
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:37,845
but I barely survived death.

892
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,097
I told you

893
01:07:40,181 --> 01:07:42,600
to beg them for forgiveness
and let them beat you up.

894
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:44,602
You shouldn't have run away.

895
01:07:44,685 --> 01:07:47,480
But it hurt!

896
01:07:49,982 --> 01:07:53,486
Like you said, Hwang Taeyong
came to help Lee Seungcheon.

897
01:07:56,030 --> 01:07:58,824
Too bad the situation ended so easily.

898
01:07:59,325 --> 01:08:02,036
If you'd called the police
and sued for assault,

899
01:08:02,119 --> 01:08:03,871
Hwang Taeyong would have been
more submissive.

900
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:07,958
Does Lee Seungcheon
have something on Hwang Taeyong?

901
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,335
Why would he be submissive?

902
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:14,048
Because Hwang Taeyong is Lee Seungcheon.

903
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,383
What are you saying?

904
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:18,552
Are you saying they're similar?

905
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,430
Yes, they're both rude.
They have that in common.

906
01:08:22,098 --> 01:08:23,349
But, Dad.

907
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:26,018
-Did Hwang Taeyong really do this to you?
-No…

908
01:08:28,729 --> 01:08:31,774
What are you talking about?
It was Lee Seungcheon.

909
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:36,445
This is unexpected of him.

910
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:39,198
He can even beat someone up?

911
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:03,222
I WAS HAPPY TO BE WITH YOU
IN THIS BEAUTIFUL WORLD, NA SANGGUK

912
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:04,431
Dad.

913
01:09:05,850 --> 01:09:07,017
I'll come again.

914
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,036
TAEYONG

915
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,878
TAEYONG

916
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,591
Hi, it's me. What's up?

917
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:42,970
I was just wondering
if you needed my help.

918
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:46,932
I'm okay. I don't need your help.

919
01:09:48,642 --> 01:09:49,560
I see.

920
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,105
Juhee, where are you right now?

921
01:09:56,150 --> 01:09:57,568
I came to visit my dad.

922
01:09:58,360 --> 01:09:59,570
Should I go pick you up?

923
01:10:01,113 --> 01:10:02,531
-If you don't mind, I--
-Seungcheon.

924
01:10:03,324 --> 01:10:04,617
He said he'd come for me.

925
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:06,744
I see.

926
01:10:09,246 --> 01:10:12,458
You can ask me for help at any time.
Let me know if anything happens.

927
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:17,588
NA JUHEE

928
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,888
Why did I lie that Seungcheon was coming?

929
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:44,531
Hey.

930
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:49,286
I heard you bailed on Alex Boo yesterday.

931
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,041
I'm over the hump thanks to it.

932
01:10:54,875 --> 01:10:56,460
He decided to invest in me again.

933
01:10:58,963 --> 01:10:59,838
Thanks.

934
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:03,050
I wanted to tell you that.

935
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,014
Oh, right.

936
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,646
I heard something interesting.

937
01:11:18,732 --> 01:11:20,109
About President Na,

938
01:11:21,735 --> 01:11:23,570
rumor says he was murdered.

939
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:25,990
He was murdered?

940
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:29,660
-Who would--
-I'm not sure.

941
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:32,413
I wonder who.

942
01:11:35,082 --> 01:11:37,751
Probably someone
who had a grudge against him.

943
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:42,381
But then I realized something.

944
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,010
The day you came home drunk.

945
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:50,889
He died that day.

946
01:11:52,850 --> 01:11:54,101
What do you mean by that?

947
01:11:56,395 --> 01:11:58,689
I'm just saying.

948
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:00,149
Don't mind it.

949
01:12:00,941 --> 01:12:03,444
I think it came from those
who like to gossip.

950
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,362
I doubt it's true.

951
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:28,445
What does President Na's death

952
01:13:28,529 --> 01:13:30,614
have to do with Hwang Taeyong
having a drink?

953
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,637
Mr. Hwang Taeyong. This is the police.

954
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,596
PARK SINHYUNG

955
01:13:55,180 --> 01:13:57,599
You're under arrest for murder.
Arrest him.

956
01:14:00,477 --> 01:14:04,022
You have the right to consult
an attorney and to remain silent.

957
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:06,483
Everything you say from now on

958
01:14:06,567 --> 01:14:08,735
may be used against you in a court of law.

959
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:09,820
Take him.

960
01:14:37,014 --> 01:14:39,057
You startled me, Lee Seungcheon.

961
01:15:25,729 --> 01:15:27,731
THE GOLDEN SPOON

962
01:15:28,565 --> 01:15:30,609
Is this what rich people do for fun?

963
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:33,237
It seems the butler
saw Hwang Taeyong that day.

964
01:15:33,904 --> 01:15:36,031
I won't let Juhee find out
about it no matter what.

965
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:39,159
Experience what it feels like to be poor.

966
01:15:39,243 --> 01:15:42,162
I'm calling to tell you something
that might intrigue you.

967
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:44,206
He went to
the same school with Seo Juntae?

968
01:15:44,665 --> 01:15:47,584
He's not the Lee Seungcheon
you knew and liked. He's not the same guy.

969
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,919
I found something amusing.

970
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:52,422
Did you kill my dad?
