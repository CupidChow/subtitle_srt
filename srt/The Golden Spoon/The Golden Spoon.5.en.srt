1
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,454
FOOLING THE LOCALS
DOSIN CONSTRUCTION, WAKE UP!

2
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:54,846
Damn, what a mess!

3
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,058
What the hell is taking them so long
to break through?

4
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:01,895
Push!

5
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,898
We have to push through!

6
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,734
-Be careful!
-Watch out!

7
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,529
What's the fuss? They should
just wrap it up and come down.

8
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,768
A man fell? What happened?

9
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:46,981
The service team was driving people out,
and it must have been quite chaotic.

10
00:01:47,065 --> 00:01:49,567
This could have ruined
our 20-trillion-won business.

11
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,611
Handle it quickly before it gets out.

12
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:55,782
Sir, I think it's best
if you visit him yourself.

13
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,872
DOSIN HOSPITAL

14
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:12,173
Dad.

15
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,929
Dad.

16
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:18,847
Dad!

17
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:21,891
Dad…

18
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:29,524
Dad.

19
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,067
Dad.

20
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,068
Dad!

21
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:17,113
What happened, Dad?

22
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,867
Dad! Dad!

23
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,745
No, don't worry.

24
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,039
I'm all right.

25
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:29,500
Are you okay? Are you sure, Dad?

26
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,169
I'm okay…

27
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,630
Dad. Dad.

28
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,965
Yes, sure.

29
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,392
I came because I heard Seungcheon's dad
got injured while working for our company,

30
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:48,603
then I saw Attorney Go.

31
00:03:49,103 --> 00:03:51,231
I was surprised,
wondering if you had gotten hurt too.

32
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:53,733
Were you?

33
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,654
I was so worried
that I said "Dad" by mistake.

34
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,447
I'm sorry, Father.

35
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,501
That's understandable.

36
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,088
Lee Seungcheon and his father.

37
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,216
What an ill-fated coincidence.

38
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,012
I'm going back to my office.
You're going home, I presume?

39
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,472
No, I'll stay here.

40
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,558
Here? Why?

41
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:29,936
Well…

42
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,856
There are a lot of reporters
and people watching.

43
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,360
If I stay here, it might help
with Dosin's reputation.

44
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,460
Taeyong has become very thoughtful.

45
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,588
He even cares for the group's reputation.
He's really like a different person.

46
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:01,676
-Does he seem different to you too?
-Pardon?

47
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,352
He's changed so much.

48
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,649
You said you were drawing
educational cartoons for your friend.

49
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,818
Why would you get hurt doing such a thing?

50
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:20,069
Stop it, Sungah!

51
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:23,156
-Dad didn't do anything wrong.
-What? No one asked him to make money.

52
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,534
He should've just stayed put
instead of causing all this trouble!

53
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,037
And what did you do so well? Tell me!

54
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,538
Kids, will you please be quiet?

55
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,458
Don't make it hard for your dad.

56
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,419
Hwang Taeyong?

57
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,760
Hwang Taeyong, why are you still here?

58
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,014
What is it? Do you need anything?

59
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,517
What's with him?
What is this punk doing here?

60
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,437
You can tell me.
What is it that you want to say?

61
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,231
Honey.

62
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,411
Yes, Dad. What is it?

63
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,538
Seungcheon.

64
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:15,291
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:21,756
Honey.

66
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,800
Honey!

67
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,093
-Over here, doctor!
-Excuse me!

68
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,010
Dad!

69
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:28,763
-Please help!
-Over here!

70
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:31,474
Excuse me. Prepare for intubation.

71
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:43,277
What's wrong?

72
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:45,196
-Honey.
-Dad…

73
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,409
Honey, you can't die.

74
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,536
Hang in there a little.

75
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,056
OPERATING ROOM
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY

76
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,058
-What do we do?
-Mom…

77
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,565
What's going to happen to Dad?

78
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:28,281
This is punishment.

79
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,825
What?

80
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,371
It's punishment.

81
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,336
Taeyong!

82
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,428
The heavens must be punishing me.

83
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:55,057
For abandoning my own family
to become rich.

84
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,400
Please save him.
It's all my fault. I'm sorry.

85
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:06,819
I don't want the golden spoon anymore.

86
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,613
I'll go back to my family.

87
00:08:08,696 --> 00:08:09,697
So, please…

88
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:13,659
Please just save my dad.

89
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:26,839
That boy Lee Seungcheon is running late.

90
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,220
He has to get here before sunset.

91
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:14,804
What are you doing?

92
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,606
-What are you doing in my room?
-I was waiting for you.

93
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,441
Can't you tell?

94
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,362
Are you running away from home?

95
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,411
Is that blood? Did you get into a fight?

96
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,247
What is this?

97
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,625
Isn't this too old-fashioned
for a runaway item?

98
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:45,543
Give it back.

99
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,380
What will you do with it?
Sell it to book a hotel room?

100
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,465
Darn it!

101
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:56,846
It's none of your business.

102
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,768
How dare you?

103
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:18,701
I have to go.

104
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,870
Move!

105
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,008
What's gotten into him?

106
00:10:36,886 --> 00:10:38,012
Just where is he going?

107
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,067
Hey, Hwang Taeyong. How's Dad?

108
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:57,156
"Hwang Taeyong?" I know it's you.

109
00:10:57,239 --> 00:11:00,910
And thanks for your concern,
but stay out of it now.

110
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:03,621
He's ridiculous.

111
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:06,415
This is punishment.

112
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:08,876
What?

113
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,879
It's punishment.

114
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,173
He's strange.

115
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,594
He must be feeling responsible
because it's related to Dosin,

116
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:20,137
but I think he's overreacting.

117
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,472
Is that what it is?

118
00:11:21,555 --> 00:11:22,640
OPERATING ROOM

119
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,395
Dad.

120
00:11:29,814 --> 00:11:32,775
The surgery went well,
but we'll have to see when he wakes up.

121
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,318
Thank you.

122
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:52,128
Granny!

123
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,673
Granny!

124
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,773
Granny!

125
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,702
Granny!

126
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,329
Granny!

127
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,560
Seungcheon, I didn't know
you could cry so much.

128
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,229
I didn't…

129
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,483
Mom.

130
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,402
Dad will be okay now, right?

131
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:02,031
-Nothing bad will happen?
-Of course he'll be okay.

132
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,411
Seungcheon, I'll stay here with him,
so go back home now.

133
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,163
No, I'll stay too.

134
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,998
You need to go to school tomorrow.

135
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:14,043
Sungah will be here too. Hurry home.

136
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,879
But I'm okay.

137
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,838
Come on.

138
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,341
Okay.

139
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,688
How silly. I was in such a rush earlier…

140
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:36,482
Mom.

141
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:39,485
Mix-and-match fashion
is in trend these days.

142
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:40,861
It looks pretty.

143
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:44,031
-I'll be off.
-All right.

144
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:57,461
Yeah, Mom.

145
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,755
We're not kids.

146
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,883
I'll make dinner for Seungcheon,
so don't worry.

147
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,595
Okay. What do you want me to bring later?

148
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,853
Damn, the lights are out again.

149
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,320
What?

150
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:25,573
Who are you?

151
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:34,707
What… Hwang Taeyong?

152
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,960
What are you…

153
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,024
Seungcheon.

154
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,407
I was going to make dinner for you,
but you were eating alone?

155
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,914
My goodness.

156
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:17,958
Hey.

157
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,879
Are you crying?

158
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:29,595
-Sungah.
-What?

159
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:34,141
I'm Seungcheon, right?

160
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,476
I'm your brother,

161
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,354
Lee Seungcheon, right?

162
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,856
What is wrong with you?

163
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:45,027
Hey, snap out of it.

164
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:46,862
Why are you crying?

165
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,032
-Don't cry. Why are you crying?
-Sungah.

166
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:52,201
There, there.

167
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:54,286
Don't cry.

168
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,790
Seungcheon, goodness.

169
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:58,916
I want water.

170
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,798
-You want water?
-Yeah.

171
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,007
Goodness.

172
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:24,441
Hey, kid. Are you getting these or not?

173
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,361
Excuse me?

174
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,117
What on earth?

175
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,036
Just what

176
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:38,998
am I doing here?

177
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:33,093
Seungcheon.

178
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,264
I told you to stay home.
Why did you come back?

179
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:41,351
Mom.

180
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,103
Seungcheon, what happened to your face?

181
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,229
Mom.

182
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,273
Mom…

183
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,484
Mom. Mom.

184
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,027
Mom…

185
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,615
I came because I missed you.

186
00:17:55,491 --> 00:18:00,537
I missed you and Dad so much.

187
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,333
That's why I came back.

188
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,212
Seungcheon.

189
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:15,260
Seungcheon.

190
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,930
Dad! Dad!

191
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:21,183
Dad, do you recognize me?

192
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,145
-Yes.
-Honey.

193
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,272
Honey!

194
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:30,275
Are you okay? Honey…

195
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,735
I'm okay.

196
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:33,779
My goodness.

197
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,406
What is it? What's going on?

198
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,951
Dad!

199
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,205
Mom…

200
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,707
-Honey.
-Dad, I'm sorry.

201
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,378
Dad, I'm sorry.

202
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,798
Mom…

203
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,591
Granny!

204
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:55,968
Granny…

205
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:57,719
Granny!

206
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,434
Granny…

207
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,831
Hey, you brat.

208
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,586
You shouldn't be shouting
when you showed up so late.

209
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:31,628
Granny.

210
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:35,757
So what was it like, living for a month?

211
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,306
I want to go back.

212
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:44,641
You do?

213
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:52,316
Then I guess I'll help you with that.

214
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,920
Take this. Go to your actual house
by the end of today

215
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:15,088
and just have one meal.

216
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:20,510
One meal? Not three meals?

217
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,845
Yes, just one meal.

218
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,723
Then everything will go back to its place.

219
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,850
What about Taeyong?

220
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,646
He will forget about the time
when he was Lee Seungcheon

221
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,023
and go back to being his original self.

222
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:37,027
Except for what involves
this golden spoon, of course.

223
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,111
Is it even possible?

224
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:42,282
Why would it not be possible?
Do you have any more questions?

225
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,661
If you don't,
I'll see you again after a year.

226
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,996
When we meet,

227
00:20:48,455 --> 00:20:51,625
you will be given another chance
to choose your parents.

228
00:20:54,711 --> 00:20:57,589
No, I will never see you again.

229
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,765
Won't you regret it?

230
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:13,021
I won't.

231
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,617
Young master. Young master.

232
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:27,869
Young master?

233
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,128
I was so worried about you.

234
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:38,672
Why can't you wake up?

235
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,590
What about Mom?

236
00:21:42,426 --> 00:21:45,012
-Pardon?
-Did Mom go out?

237
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,098
I don't understand.

238
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,643
What's for breakfast today?

239
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,521
I asked her to make kimchi stew.

240
00:21:55,105 --> 00:21:56,356
Young master, what's wrong?

241
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,151
Your mother passed away.

242
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,823
Get ready and hurry out.
The president is waiting.

243
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:23,800
Mom?

244
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,011
Yes, it's me.

245
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:28,555
It's okay, my son.

246
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,024
Mom…

247
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:47,991
I'm sure

248
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,953
I had a mom.

249
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,341
Taeyong.

250
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,220
I heard you were at the hospital for
Lee Seungcheon's dad until late at night.

251
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:12,766
You should be studying.
You have no time for that.

252
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,601
Don't do it from now on, all right?

253
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:16,520
Okay.

254
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,069
I heard you bought an apartment.

255
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,656
One that's perfect for a family of four.

256
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,160
I bought an apartment?

257
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,246
Young master?

258
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,457
I'll take it.

259
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:45,006
Yes, right. I did.

260
00:23:46,216 --> 00:23:49,052
Honey, why would you bring that up now?

261
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,053
Why did you buy it?

262
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,725
To help Lee Seungcheon?

263
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:57,686
Why would you?

264
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,530
No reason. I just wanted to help him.

265
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:10,699
I felt like I had to.

266
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,410
Don't tell me…
Did you get threatened again?

267
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,079
Did Lee Seungcheon
and his parents threaten you?

268
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:17,747
Threaten?

269
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,958
There are always such people.

270
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,296
Maybe they wanted
to leech off you, Taeyong.

271
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:27,257
They're not like that.
Do you even know Seungcheon's parents?

272
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,050
No, you don't.

273
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,095
Don't speak ill of them
when they did nothing wrong.

274
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,638
Being poor isn't a sin!

275
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,523
I'm sorry.

276
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,329
As you said, being poor isn't a sin.

277
00:24:59,039 --> 00:24:59,915
It's a disease.

278
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:05,921
An inherited disease
that comes down from father to child.

279
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,256
That is poverty.

280
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,638
I guess I overestimated you.

281
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,433
I took care of the apartment,

282
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,393
so that's that.

283
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,794
You left as if you'd run away from home.

284
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:46,920
Why did you come back?

285
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,133
-Uncle.
-Why aren't you doing anything?

286
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,553
Come at me like yesterday.

287
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:57,347
-Come at me, you punk.
-Uncle.

288
00:25:58,265 --> 00:25:59,099
Young master.

289
00:26:01,851 --> 00:26:03,395
-It's time for school.
-Ah.

290
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,230
Is it already time?

291
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,527
Have fun at school, Taeyong.

292
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:13,238
Study hard.

293
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,248
A former special forces agent
is different, indeed.

294
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:32,882
Are you okay?

295
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:34,926
I'm okay.

296
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,055
I'm sorry about the apartment.

297
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,058
The registration certificate
went to Attorney Go.

298
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,894
-Because you're a minor.
-Munki.

299
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:47,689
Why did I buy an apartment?

300
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:57,991
What are these?

301
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:01,661
Why are these in my pocket?

302
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:29,439
Gosh, my back.

303
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,576
Who bought these?

304
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:47,916
BOOK OF SOLUTIONS

305
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,884
I bought this with my first paycheck,

306
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,344
and I'm finally giving it to you.

307
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:04,557
Seungcheon, when you're troubled
or concerned, open this book.

308
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,102
It may not be able to give you an answer,

309
00:28:07,394 --> 00:28:09,646
but it will comfort and encourage you.

310
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,781
P.S.

311
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,326
Guess what I got
when I opened it just now.

312
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,002
"The happiness of having
a good person with you."

313
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,632
Juhee!

314
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,219
Juhee.

315
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:47,350
You will never know

316
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,686
how happy I am right now.

317
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,646
Seungcheon?

318
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,448
It's too early for that, kids.

319
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,909
What's happening to this world?

320
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,580
Have a good day.

321
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,624
I'm sorry. I couldn't help it.

322
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:14,544
I understand.

323
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,759
-Are you coming to school?
-I'll be there later.

324
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:23,553
Go on. You might be late.

325
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,221
See you later at school.

326
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:46,785
EVEN IF YOU LOSE EVERYTHING,
YOU WILL GAIN ONE PERSON

327
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:48,536
Lee Seungcheon,

328
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:52,207
I'm so happy that I got to know you.

329
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,335
Me too.

330
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:59,589
Mmm. It's sweet.

331
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:04,552
You should know
that you're really lucky, Dad.

332
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:09,599
The doctor said
the heavens helped you survive.

333
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,518
I see. By the way,
who bought these tangerines?

334
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,812
The girl from yesterday, right?

335
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:16,147
She came on your birthday too.
What was her name?

336
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,192
Huh! Na Juhee!

337
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:20,568
Oops, I'm sorry.

338
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,695
Hey, be honest with us.

339
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,239
What's going on between you two?

340
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,533
Nothing's going on.

341
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:31,204
As if. I can tell there is something.

342
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:34,249
-Honey, Seungcheon got a girlfriend?
-Gosh, Dad!

343
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:35,333
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

344
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:37,669
I said, there's nothing.

345
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,215
-Is it this room?
-Yes, sir.

346
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,638
Sir.

347
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:49,597
Hey, Lee.

348
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:54,352
Are you happy resting here
after wrecking the hell out of my car?

349
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:56,604
What will you do with the repair?

350
00:30:57,397 --> 00:31:00,692
-How much is it?
-The repair fee?

351
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,486
It's 100 million won.

352
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:05,530
-Excuse me?
-I said, 100 million.

353
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,869
It's already been a month.

354
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:11,995
LEE SEUNGCHEON USES GOLDEN SPOON

355
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,789
I'm sure he met the old woman yesterday.

356
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,335
Could that be Lee Seungcheon
or Hwang Taeyong?

357
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:21,713
Lee Seungcheon!

358
00:31:22,672 --> 00:31:23,756
Lee Seungcheon.

359
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,688
Did you just call me Lee Seungcheon?

360
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:41,608
What makes you think I'm him?

361
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:45,361
You looked exactly like him from the back,
but you're Hwang Taeyong.

362
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,988
My bad.

363
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,198
Oh Yeojin.

364
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,451
I guess you'll do anything
to get my attention.

365
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:55,079
But too bad.
This approach seems just as cheap.

366
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,672
Lee Seungcheon went back to his parents?

367
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,059
He said he'd come.

368
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,692
And my watch isn't broken.

369
00:32:28,363 --> 00:32:30,490
We're coming in.

370
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,492
Good morning! Good morning!

371
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:35,078
Morning to you all.

372
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,622
Seungcheon. How did it go?

373
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:40,083
What, 100 million won?

374
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,585
What kind of car repair costs 100 million?

375
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:45,046
That's enough to buy a new car.

376
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,547
Maybe something's wrong.

377
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,134
Damn it. Show you mercy?
Are you kidding me?

378
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,805
We had to call off the contract
because of your husband.

379
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,390
And we're basically out on the streets.

380
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:59,602
And I even have to show you mercy
with my car repair?

381
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,524
Sir, but our situation…

382
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:07,735
Your situation is not my business.

383
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,113
Please just show mercy this once.

384
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:12,323
We really have no money!

385
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:13,866
Then make money.

386
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:23,334
What do you say? I'll find you
a nice place to work at.

387
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:26,004
What are you saying to a kid?

388
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,297
Then bring me money.

389
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,174
I'll charge you

390
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:33,094
two million more each day
for the rental car.

391
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,347
Why the hell do I have
to look out for your situation?

392
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:39,892
If anyone looks for me,
tell them I went to meet a client.

393
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,561
Have a safe trip, sir.

394
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,278
Two million won…

395
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:56,951
Mom, one of my customers
works at a karaoke in Cheongdam.

396
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,371
Actually, she gave me a business card.

397
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,999
I can make one million won a day.

398
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,251
Should I try it out?

399
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:08,713
Are you crazy? Are you out of your mind?

400
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:11,090
How could you say that to your mom?

401
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:14,177
-You brat…
-Then what can we do?

402
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:17,388
-So why did you have to be in debt?
-As if I wanted to be in debt.

403
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,725
Try living on your own later.
Life isn't easy!

404
00:34:20,808 --> 00:34:22,935
So why did you marry a man like Dad?

405
00:34:23,519 --> 00:34:25,521
Why on earth did you have us?

406
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:28,107
If you were going to struggle in debt
like this,

407
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,568
why did you have us
and put us through this mess?

408
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:39,494
Mom.

409
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:43,414
Sungah.

410
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:48,211
I'm sorry.

411
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,046
I didn't…

412
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,006
Mom, I--

413
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:54,425
Aren't you running late?
You should go to work.

414
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:56,135
I should be going too.

415
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,349
Darn it.

416
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,129
KIDNEY, LIVER
ANYWHERE IN THE NATION, SECRECY GUARANTEED

417
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:14,213
100% LOANS FOR HOUSEWIVES

418
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:22,221
KIDNEY, LIVER

419
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,559
Yes.

420
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,563
School isn't the problem
right now, Sungah.

421
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,565
So he demanded the full amount?

422
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:37,153
Okay.

423
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,453
What do I do?

424
00:36:59,675 --> 00:37:01,344
-Hey, get out.
-Sir.

425
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:05,014
-Get out.
-Take another look at it.

426
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,307
Just get out.

427
00:37:07,308 --> 00:37:08,726
Go! Go away.

428
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:12,146
Come on. This is not a counterfeit.
It's authentic.

429
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,191
An authentic one costs 250 million won.

430
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,152
How would a high schooler carry it around?
Is your father filthy rich?

431
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,988
What if he is? What if I got it as a gift?

432
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,531
Just look at this brat.

433
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,033
What are you doing?

434
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,535
I was going to let it slide
because I have a son your age.

435
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,954
But this won't do.

436
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:30,748
Hello? Is this the police?

437
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,793
Sir, please let it slide. It's my dad…

438
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:37,088
He's really ill,
and I desperately need money.

439
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:40,883
Please let it slide this once.

440
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:52,603
That moron.

441
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,108
He's got so many pricey watches

442
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,735
when he knows so little about fashion.

443
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,489
Won't you regret it?

444
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:51,579
I won't regret it. Ever.

445
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,799
SEJIN HOSPITAL

446
00:39:14,268 --> 00:39:16,395
UPPER ABDOMEN ULTRASOUND:
KIDNEY STONES FOUND

447
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,814
You got an ultrasound
for your liver and kidneys, right?

448
00:39:19,815 --> 00:39:22,360
-Yes.
-I'll call you as soon as the date's set.

449
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:23,944
Take good care of your health.

450
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:42,463
She'll be away for a week?

451
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:45,466
She knows a few people in Suncheon.

452
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:47,385
She'll borrow some money from them.

453
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:48,594
And that takes a week?

454
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,262
She won't just ask them for money.

455
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:52,223
She might have to sweep, clean,

456
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,476
and work her butt off for them.

457
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:09,824
Mom.

458
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,453
This is different from what you promised.

459
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,331
You said you'd pay me
half the amount in advance.

460
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,958
You can't say you'll pay 30 million now.

461
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:23,129
You saw my medical checkup result.

462
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,172
It said my kidneys and liver were healthy.

463
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,925
You have to pay me 50 million--

464
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:30,302
Seungcheon.

465
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,013
Well, it turns out
you have a kidney stone.

466
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,723
-Wait…
-Fifty is when you're clean.

467
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,101
I'll pay you 30.
Take the rest after the surgery.

468
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,894
-Wait.
-Who are you?

469
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,397
What are you saying to my mom?

470
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,023
Now, who is this moron?

471
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,650
What are you trying to do to my mom?

472
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,194
Tell me. Where are you?

473
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,696
Tell me right now!

474
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:53,909
Hello? Hello?

475
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,500
Mom.

476
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:04,587
Who is he?

477
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:07,006
Well, Seungcheon.

478
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,091
What were you trying to do?

479
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:11,469
Sell your organs?

480
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,430
Were you really going to do such a thing?

481
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,475
Mom!

482
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,271
There was no other way.

483
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:25,566
I couldn't see any other way

484
00:41:26,901 --> 00:41:28,527
to get money…

485
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,496
Even so, how could you think
to do such a thing?

486
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,834
Don't do anything, and just wait.

487
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,504
-I'll take care of this.
-What?

488
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:51,217
Seungcheon, where are you going?

489
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:52,843
Seungcheon!

490
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,137
Seungcheon!

491
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,898
I'm sorry.

492
00:42:09,735 --> 00:42:10,653
How may I help you?

493
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:12,363
I'm here to meet President Hwang Hyeondo.

494
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,157
You can't go in without an appointment.

495
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:17,243
I said I'm here to meet President Hwang!

496
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,454
-You can't go in.
-Just a moment is enough!

497
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:21,622
Stop him.

498
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:32,800
Lee Seungcheon?

499
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:39,765
Dad.

500
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,768
Hey, you're back.

501
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:44,478
Dad.

502
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:46,939
-Yes?
-Aren't you tired, Dad?

503
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,025
You must be tired
from going through so much lately.

504
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:54,822
What's with you?
You're acting unusual today.

505
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:58,617
Well, I just thought I'd been
too inattentive to you these days.

506
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:02,079
So you know. Gosh, that feels good.

507
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:07,459
Do you have something to tell me?

508
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,628
Yes.

509
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,424
-What is it?
-Dad.

510
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,385
I want 100 million won.

511
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:19,054
What, 100 million won?

512
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,017
You want 100 million won?

513
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:31,150
You came here out of the blue
to demand 100 million won?

514
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:34,653
I'm a bit dumbfounded.

515
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,532
I'm not simply demanding it.
Lend me the money.

516
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:43,746
Then I'll make sure to pay you back.

517
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:47,750
You see,

518
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,421
money isn't something you can easily lend
no matter how much you have.

519
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,424
What's so hard about lending me the money?
It's not even for free.

520
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:57,801
You have a lot of money.

521
00:43:57,885 --> 00:44:01,138
And my dad got injured
while working at Dosin's demolition site.

522
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,640
Shouldn't Dosin take responsibility?

523
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:03,641
You're wrong.

524
00:44:05,017 --> 00:44:08,312
Dosin contracted a service company
for the demolition,

525
00:44:09,521 --> 00:44:11,148
and your father worked for them.

526
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:13,692
Still, I paid for his treatment.

527
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:17,488
I think I've done enough.

528
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,032
What more do you want?

529
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,453
This must be why big companies
subcontract their work.

530
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,875
They can shift the safety cost
without having to pay for people's lives.

531
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,129
We use the term partner company
instead these days.

532
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,214
"Partner?"

533
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:40,386
Anyway, so you won't lend me the money?

534
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:43,055
I've wasted my time then.

535
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,894
I will lend it to you.

536
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,112
I will lend you 100 million won.

537
00:45:08,163 --> 00:45:09,289
But tell me.

538
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,669
What can you offer as collateral?

539
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:24,555
Myself.

540
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,521
I'll put up myself, my life

541
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,899
as collateral.

542
00:45:38,193 --> 00:45:39,236
Lend me

543
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:45,409
the money.

544
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:57,212
I wish you were my son.

545
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,341
You've got some guts. I give you that.

546
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:03,010
But too bad.

547
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,765
What you can borrow with yourself
or your parents as collateral

548
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,932
is poverty alone.

549
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,482
And no one would be willing
to invest their money

550
00:46:19,651 --> 00:46:20,819
in that poverty.

551
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,886
You're trying to help the piano boy
from the other day, aren't you?

552
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:47,179
You can't fool me.

553
00:46:48,430 --> 00:46:50,557
I can never give you the money.

554
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,559
I'm sorry, Dad.

555
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:57,523
I will just consider
that you gave me the money.

556
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:07,032
Miss, it's time to eat.

557
00:47:07,825 --> 00:47:10,244
What are you doing?

558
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,412
I'm going to sell them all.

559
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:16,291
Miss Juhee.

560
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,381
Keep this from my dad, all right?

561
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,941
What you can borrow with
yourself or your parents as collateral

562
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,610
is poverty alone.

563
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,595
CASHIER'S CHECK

564
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,891
I'm glad I can help Seungcheon
this way at least.

565
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,185
Seungcheon…

566
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,820
This is 100 million won.
I hope it comes in handy.

567
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,991
Oh Yeojin, why would you…

568
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:33,994
Don't mind the reason.
You guys are struggling right now.

569
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:36,872
My dad lent you this money.
Hurry and take it.

570
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,668
It's all right. Take it.

571
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:50,052
Yeojin. Thank you.
I'll make sure to pay you back.

572
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,803
I promise I will.

573
00:49:04,483 --> 00:49:07,027
Cheer up, Seungcheon. We're friends.

574
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,570
Thank you, Yeojin.

575
00:49:34,972 --> 00:49:36,890
1 YEAR LATER

576
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,352
How refreshing.

577
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:41,937
-Taeyong.
-Thanks.

578
00:49:44,272 --> 00:49:46,525
Next is you, Yeojin.

579
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,281
Look who this is.
Long time no see, Na Juhee.

580
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,242
I didn't think you'd come.

581
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:59,413
The semester ended,
and I heard you guys would all gather.

582
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:00,580
I see.

583
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:03,417
Dongkyung, isn't Seungcheon coming today?

584
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:08,255
He's retaking the college entrance exam.
He probably didn't want to come.

585
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,133
SNU, SNU, SNU.

586
00:50:11,216 --> 00:50:12,968
SKY, SKY, and one in-Seoul university.

587
00:50:13,468 --> 00:50:14,845
He'd be intimidated if he came.

588
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,138
Hey.

589
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:21,560
It's not because he's intimidated.
He's just too busy to come, my friend.

590
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:24,521
He's struggling so much,
studying and working part-time.

591
00:50:24,604 --> 00:50:26,815
-Well, I…
-You're hopeless.

592
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:28,567
So he still works that much.

593
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:32,779
Weren't you close to Seungcheon?
Aren't you in touch these days?

594
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:35,574
What? Well, no.

595
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:39,494
Guys, what's with this mood?

596
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,247
-Come on, get up.
-Let's drink!

597
00:50:42,330 --> 00:50:43,957
Get up. You know the chant, right?

598
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,042
-Of course.
-Yes.

599
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,334
Taeyong!

600
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,712
-Thanks for the drinks!
-Thanks for the drinks!

601
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,631
Hurry up!

602
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:03,810
COMPELLING, AGGRAVATION, RELINQUISH,
DEFIANT, SUBJUGATE, RUDIMENTARY

603
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:06,897
Hey, snap out of it. What are you doing?

604
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:08,315
We're busy as hell.

605
00:51:09,066 --> 00:51:09,900
Sorry, sir.

606
00:51:21,912 --> 00:51:24,664
Lee Seungcheon, come pick me up by 9 p.m.

607
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:33,131
Guys, let's go to a karaoke.

608
00:51:33,215 --> 00:51:35,926
-Let's go to a karaoke.
-Let's go another round.

609
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,470
-That's enough.
-Knock it off.

610
00:51:39,262 --> 00:51:40,430
-What?
-Seungcheon.

611
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,642
What?

612
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:46,019
I didn't think you could make it.
How did you come?

613
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:49,981
Juhee.

614
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,195
How have you been?

615
00:51:58,698 --> 00:52:00,325
What's with this mood?

616
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,785
-You came.
-What?

617
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,037
I called him so we could go home together.

618
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:06,373
Why would you go home together?

619
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:10,043
-Ah, we live in the same--
-We live in the same neighborhood.

620
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:14,673
I moved to a place
near her house last year.

621
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,550
Really?

622
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,426
Then why didn't you tell us?

623
00:52:18,510 --> 00:52:21,179
-Right, why didn't you?
-You could've told us.

624
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:23,640
I asked him to go home with me
if he was done working.

625
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:26,059
Let's meet up more often, guys.
Especially Na Juhee.

626
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:28,270
Let's go, Seungcheon.

627
00:52:30,188 --> 00:52:32,149
-Gosh, I feel drunk.
-Hey.

628
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,736
They seem suspicious.

629
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,780
-Why are they suspicious?
-Maybe they're going out!

630
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:39,739
No way.

631
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,533
There must be something between them.

632
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:44,661
I'll be going then. See you, guys.

633
00:52:44,744 --> 00:52:46,454
-What about karaoke?
-Where are you going?

634
00:52:46,538 --> 00:52:47,747
-Come with us.
-Another round!

635
00:52:52,878 --> 00:52:54,004
Hey, Janggun.

636
00:52:54,087 --> 00:52:55,380
Gosh, Taeyong.

637
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,930
At least I got to see him.

638
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,308
That's what matters.

639
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,735
-Taeyong?
-It's expected to shower.

640
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,528
No, it's not.

641
00:53:19,446 --> 00:53:21,990
People are watching. Close the umbrella.

642
00:53:22,824 --> 00:53:26,203
They're watching because you're pretty.
Don't mind them.

643
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,083
And,

644
00:53:33,418 --> 00:53:34,502
forget everything.

645
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,589
Everything you have in mind except for me.

646
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,217
Put it all behind you.

647
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:42,677
We'll be

648
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:45,555
engaged at the end of this year.

649
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,196
Didn't you tell your friends about us?

650
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:03,490
They seemed clueless.

651
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:06,993
Dongkyung, Jaedon, and Juhee too.

652
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:11,039
That's understandable.

653
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:12,457
I'll be careful too, from now on.

654
00:54:12,916 --> 00:54:15,085
I almost told them. How inconsiderate.

655
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,970
I'll get the door.

656
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,062
Oh.

657
00:54:34,145 --> 00:54:36,815
Sungah? I guess you
got off work early today.

658
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,066
What's the occasion?

659
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:43,405
Welcome back.

660
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:46,241
Right, I was dying hair.

661
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,386
I'm back, sir.

662
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:09,514
Hi, son.

663
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,062
-Lee!
-Yes, sir.

664
00:55:16,146 --> 00:55:18,064
Make sure to put as much you can
in the trash bag.

665
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,692
-Trash bags are really expensive.
-Yes, sir.

666
00:55:21,776 --> 00:55:23,445
He's so clumsy at his work.

667
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:26,072
What a shame for you, Ms. Jin.

668
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:29,075
You're too good for a guy like him.

669
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:34,706
Hey, do it gently.
It costs a lot to get a hair transplant.

670
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,291
My bad.

671
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,629
Welcome home, sweetheart.

672
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:44,257
-Ms. Jin.
-Yes?

673
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,510
What are you waiting for?
Get my daughter a glass of sikhye too.

674
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:49,471
Of course.

675
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,813
That's fine, you don't have to.

676
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:03,276
Dad, I need to talk to you.

677
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:08,448
Well…

678
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,868
What's her problem this time?

679
00:56:12,869 --> 00:56:14,746
-Put in as much as possible.
-Yes, sir.

680
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:20,752
Darn, this is so annoying.

681
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,213
How much longer do we have to do this?

682
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:26,091
He can't shove us around
just because we're indebted to him.

683
00:56:26,174 --> 00:56:27,384
We're not his slaves.

684
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,349
Unbelievable.

685
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:43,108
I mean, I lent them money
and I'm letting them stay here too.

686
00:56:43,191 --> 00:56:44,359
I can't ask this much of them?

687
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:48,029
Then do it behind Seungcheon's back!

688
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:51,116
Why must I tiptoe around that kid?

689
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,661
I let them in because you said
that you would end up with Hwang Taeyong.

690
00:56:54,744 --> 00:56:56,788
Now, is it going well
between you and him? No.

691
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:57,914
Dad!

692
00:57:02,460 --> 00:57:03,920
Let me tell you one more time.

693
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,383
Be good to Lee Seungcheon if you want
Hwang Taeyong as your son-in-law.

694
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,386
Be good to his family.

695
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,934
Why in the world…

696
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:33,658
Fine,

697
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,828
I'll let it go for Ms. Jin's sake.

698
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,347
ACCOUNT BALANCE CHECK

699
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,934
BALANCE: 1,105,351 WON

700
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,521
I already bought a pass
for online classes.

701
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,943
I guess college-entrance classes
are out of the picture.

702
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,571
NEST EGG

703
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:17,368
BOOK OF SOLUTIONS

704
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:25,376
BOOK OF SOLUTIONS

705
00:58:26,961 --> 00:58:28,546
How have you been?

706
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:06,876
Taeyong is waiting upstairs.

707
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:07,961
I see.

708
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:12,757
How is Taeyong these days, Doctor?

709
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,093
He's gotten a lot better.

710
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,263
Dramatically since last year.

711
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,391
Is that so? That's great to hear.

712
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:27,814
How's your headache?

713
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,942
It's all right. It's gotten a lot better.

714
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,027
Do you still have trouble
remembering things?

715
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,114
Sometimes, it feels blurry.

716
00:59:37,323 --> 00:59:39,117
But that happens to everyone, doesn't it?

717
00:59:39,993 --> 00:59:41,327
What about the incident from five…

718
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,830
No, six years ago?

719
00:59:44,747 --> 00:59:47,625
Do you still not remember it?

720
00:59:54,382 --> 00:59:55,717
Please…

721
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,178
don't kill me.

722
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:03,391
Don't kill me…

723
01:00:04,851 --> 01:00:06,644
Please don't kill me.

724
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,729
No.

725
01:00:10,690 --> 01:00:13,776
I only remember
crying and asking for mercy.

726
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:17,447
But is that incident

727
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,283
something that I need to remember?

728
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,492
No.

729
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:26,205
But it'd be good
if you could remember and face it.

730
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,084
What about the medication?

731
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:33,713
Why don't we see how you get on
without taking any?

732
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:35,798
Sure, let's do that.

733
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,259
Taking deep breaths is making it bearable.

734
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:39,927
-Really?
-Yes.

735
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:44,307
Ah. There was someone
who told me the same thing you did.

736
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:50,313
That when I'm anxious
and feel like I'm suffocating,

737
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:54,150
I should close my eyes

738
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:57,570
and breathe slowly.

739
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,707
Then like a meadow after a storm.

740
01:01:10,875 --> 01:01:12,293
Like the calm sea.

741
01:01:13,628 --> 01:01:15,505
I will find peace of mind.

742
01:01:23,596 --> 01:01:24,764
Who was it?

743
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:28,226
Someone did tell me…

744
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:36,401
but I don't remember who it was.

745
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:44,242
CONGRATULATIONS ON RELEASING A NEW ALBUM
FROM JUHEE

746
01:01:45,618 --> 01:01:47,787
Congratulations on releasing an album.

747
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:50,998
And my dad is sorry
that he can't congratulate you himself.

748
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:53,626
I know he's busy.

749
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:57,797
But seeing how you came here yourself,

750
01:01:58,089 --> 01:02:00,174
I guess you have something to tell me.

751
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,052
I heard about the engagement.

752
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:06,806
-I'm--
-Don't worry, Juhee.

753
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,642
I'm on your side.

754
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:14,564
In this day and age, getting engaged
and married as the parents see fit…

755
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,650
It actually makes no sense.

756
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:19,944
Just do as you want in life.

757
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:22,321
I think that's only right.

758
01:02:24,031 --> 01:02:24,991
Ms. Seo.

759
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,748
-Ma'am, you have a guest.
-I see.

760
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:46,429
This painting was sold for 30 billion won
at Christie's New York in 1982.

761
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:49,390
Guess how much it's worth now.

762
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:51,768
Fifty billion? A hundred?

763
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:54,771
I'm not sure. I'm not interested.

764
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:59,317
You aren't? It fascinates me
every time I see it.

765
01:03:00,318 --> 01:03:02,403
It must be amazing
to live as Hwang Taeyong.

766
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:06,240
If you were given a chance
to own all this,

767
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:07,992
what would you do?

768
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:12,497
Would you seize that chance or give it up?

769
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:15,792
Why do you ask
such a meaningless question?

770
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:17,502
No reason.

771
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:19,796
I wondered what you thought about
at houses like this.

772
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:26,010
Yeojin, what brings you here?

773
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,850
I heard you released a new album
and came to congratulate you.

774
01:03:34,101 --> 01:03:36,270
Hi, Juhee. We meet often these days.

775
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:38,105
Yeah, we do.

776
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,155
All right then.
Let's all have a cup of tea together.

777
01:03:47,406 --> 01:03:49,283
Hmm…

778
01:03:50,284 --> 01:03:51,619
But…

779
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:57,375
FROM YEOJIN, PIANIST SEO YOUNGSIN'S FAN
CONGRATULATIONS ON RELEASING A NEW ALBUM

780
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:01,254
I'm okay. Yeojin, I'll get going first.

781
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,585
Lee Seungcheon?

782
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:00,104
It's great to meet you girls
after such a long time.

783
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:06,569
But Yeojin, you came with a friend
who didn't suit you.

784
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:10,656
He's more like a porter, not a friend.

785
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,492
I see, a porter.

786
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:22,418
All right. You should stay for a meal.
It's been so long.

787
01:05:23,085 --> 01:05:24,295
I'll get things ready.

788
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:35,681
Yeojin.

789
01:05:35,848 --> 01:05:40,394
Please don't say such things
about Seungcheon to others.

790
01:05:41,145 --> 01:05:42,355
We're all friends.

791
01:05:43,564 --> 01:05:46,067
Why? Because I called him a porter?

792
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:49,111
Why do you care?

793
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,865
Is it because you lent him
100 million won?

794
01:05:55,076 --> 01:05:57,078
Yeojin, don't be like that.

795
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:59,705
You used to treat people with respect
when we were younger.

796
01:06:00,873 --> 01:06:03,960
I still remember
how nice you were to Nara.

797
01:06:05,878 --> 01:06:07,880
What do you know?

798
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,716
Let me tell you something you don't know.

799
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:14,804
Lee Seungcheon and I don't live
in the same neighborhood. It was a lie.

800
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:17,890
He lives off of my house.
The very house Jeong Nara used to live in.

801
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:20,893
What?

802
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,312
He didn't tell you this, did he?

803
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:25,940
He probably didn't tell you
that he borrowed 100 million from me.

804
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:29,694
Wake up, Na Juhee.

805
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,238
He'd do anything for money.

806
01:06:32,321 --> 01:06:35,533
He has no shame or pride
if it's about money.

807
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:38,577
Yes, she's right.

808
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:42,081
It's true that I lied,

809
01:06:42,415 --> 01:06:44,041
and I do live off of Oh Yeojin's house.

810
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,711
I have neither shame nor pride.

811
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:47,753
Seungcheon.

812
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:51,340
I was too embarrassed to tell you.

813
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,218
I didn't want you to see
this pathetic side of me.

814
01:06:55,803 --> 01:06:57,513
So I lied.

815
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:04,145
Because I like you.

816
01:07:11,652 --> 01:07:13,112
I'm sorry, Juhee.

817
01:07:24,790 --> 01:07:25,958
Seungcheon.

818
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:27,960
Seungcheon.

819
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,596
Seungcheon! Seungcheon!

820
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:48,564
Oh Yeojin, your cheap jealousy
caused a big problem.

821
01:07:49,148 --> 01:07:52,818
Remember. You brought Juhee
and Lee Seungcheon together today.

822
01:07:52,902 --> 01:07:54,278
I will never forgive you.

823
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:24,308
Seungcheon! Seungcheon!

824
01:08:31,357 --> 01:08:33,359
You can't just leave like that.

825
01:08:33,442 --> 01:08:34,902
So what if you said your part?

826
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,197
Juhee.

827
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,950
Is that why you ghosted me?

828
01:08:41,408 --> 01:08:44,745
You didn't answer my calls,
and you didn't text me back either.

829
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:48,624
I'm sorry, Juhee.

830
01:08:51,085 --> 01:08:52,044
An apology isn't enough.

831
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:55,381
You have no idea
how upset I was, you fool.

832
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,177
Juhee, I…

833
01:09:02,930 --> 01:09:04,890
I missed you so much.

834
01:09:05,891 --> 01:09:07,101
I wanted to hear

835
01:09:08,352 --> 01:09:09,562
your voice so much, but…

836
01:09:14,817 --> 01:09:16,026
I like you.

837
01:09:19,446 --> 01:09:20,823
I like you, Seungcheon.

838
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,496
Ever since I met you
for the first time until now,

839
01:09:28,289 --> 01:09:29,582
I like you too.

840
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,254
I wanted to tell you this so much.

841
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:22,760
Oh. Good shot.

842
01:10:22,843 --> 01:10:24,053
Good shot.

843
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:29,475
You even got your degree.
When will you get a job?

844
01:10:30,309 --> 01:10:31,393
Does that mean

845
01:10:31,977 --> 01:10:34,521
you'll get him a place in your company?

846
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:37,775
It's okay, Youngshin.

847
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:41,278
I don't want to be a clumsy executive

848
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,696
who pulled strings to get there.

849
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:47,576
-Good shot.
-Oh. Good shot.

850
01:10:49,662 --> 01:10:51,080
Isn't that right, Hyeondo?

851
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:55,459
Stop right there, you brat!

852
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:58,671
I will make sure to kill you today.

853
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,507
Dad, please spare me.

854
01:11:01,590 --> 01:11:04,176
Come over here! I'm going to kill you.

855
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,179
-Hurry up and get that brat.
-Dad, please.

856
01:11:08,722 --> 01:11:10,516
You'd better come over here now!

857
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,019
Did you hear?

858
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:16,814
President Na's son caused some trouble.

859
01:11:16,897 --> 01:11:18,274
Of course he knows.

860
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:22,236
What will you do about your investment?

861
01:11:23,487 --> 01:11:25,406
Oh, my goodness.

862
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,865
I'm still thinking.

863
01:11:50,889 --> 01:11:54,268
Goodness, Juhee. You grew up so much.
I barely recognized you.

864
01:11:56,228 --> 01:11:58,564
Yeojin will be back soon.
Go ahead and wait in the room.

865
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:00,107
Okay.

866
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,617
How unusual of her to visit our house.

867
01:12:12,786 --> 01:12:13,954
Are you here, sweetie?

868
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:30,721
How do you like it?
This is the best view in our neighborhood.

869
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:33,223
I know you didn't call me out
to enjoy the view.

870
01:12:34,641 --> 01:12:36,935
-What is it?
-I thought you'd be curious.

871
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,103
About what?

872
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:40,564
You know. Did you forget already?

873
01:12:42,149 --> 01:12:44,485
The golden spoon that can make you rich.

874
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,262
Yeojin?

875
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,726
Hwang Taeyong, what are you doing here?

876
01:13:18,310 --> 01:13:20,938
I came to meet Lee Seungcheon
and heard you were here.

877
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,273
Why would you meet him?

878
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:25,651
That's not your business.

879
01:13:29,613 --> 01:13:30,989
I knew it.

880
01:13:33,575 --> 01:13:35,035
Look at her taste in stuff.

881
01:13:35,994 --> 01:13:36,954
Just like

882
01:13:38,163 --> 01:13:39,498
Oh Yeojin herself.

883
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:52,344
Don't touch someone else's things.

884
01:13:57,933 --> 01:14:00,018
Hey, don't touch them.

885
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:11,280
What is

886
01:14:12,739 --> 01:14:13,615
this?

887
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:27,463
I knew it. You also used the golden spoon.

888
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,507
So you were Jeong Nara, weren't you?

889
01:14:31,175 --> 01:14:33,177
The one who sent the video to the police.

890
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:35,304
The one who texted me.

891
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:37,473
Was it all you?

892
01:14:37,556 --> 01:14:39,224
Yes, it was me.

893
01:14:40,058 --> 01:14:42,895
I sent it with one of my dad's
burner phones.

894
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:44,354
To know about you, Lee Seungcheon.

895
01:14:45,147 --> 01:14:47,316
-What?
-And I became sure

896
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:49,985
how much you wanted to live
as Hwang Taeyong.

897
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:53,655
But it sure was unexpected
when you went back to your parents.

898
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:57,367
Well, there will be other chances.

899
01:14:58,410 --> 01:15:01,538
You will go back
to being Hwang Taeyong, right?

900
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,132
No, I won't.

901
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:16,720
With my mom, my dad, my sister, and Juhee,

902
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:19,348
I'll live as Lee Seungcheon.

903
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:22,726
That is my name, my family,

904
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:26,855
and the one I love.

905
01:15:30,067 --> 01:15:30,943
No one's stopping you.

906
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:33,779
That's up to you to decide.

907
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:36,490
Then,

908
01:15:37,533 --> 01:15:39,535
I guess you don't need
this golden spoon anymore.

909
01:15:43,497 --> 01:15:44,456
No!

910
01:15:56,134 --> 01:15:57,678
What have you done?

911
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,434
You must want to use
the golden spoon again.

912
01:16:45,517 --> 01:16:48,520
I'm not afraid at all because I have you.

913
01:16:48,604 --> 01:16:50,731
Treat Seungcheon with respect.

914
01:16:50,814 --> 01:16:52,899
Lee Seungcheon used
to have a golden spoon too.

915
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:55,068
-Are you insane?
-Where's my golden spoon?

916
01:16:55,152 --> 01:16:56,820
Where did I put
Lee Seungcheon's golden spoon?

917
01:16:56,903 --> 01:17:00,490
There's something else
that only you know, isn't there?

918
01:17:00,574 --> 01:17:01,867
Dad.

919
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:03,243
I'll kill myself!

920
01:17:03,327 --> 01:17:05,329
You can't die right now.
