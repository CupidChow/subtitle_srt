INTERVIEW IDENTIFICATION SLIP
NAME: LEE SEUNGCHEON

3
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,749
Seoul Jeil High? You're my junior.

4
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:44,044
I did go to study abroad
after going there for a year.

5
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,212
Still, a junior is a junior.

6
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:50,592
All right. Let's see, my junior.

7
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,680
You haven't gone to study abroad at all?

8
00:00:56,431 --> 00:01:00,310
What is this? You won a Gold Prize
for your short webtoon?

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,021
There's a Half-Alien in My House.

10
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,649
You have a lot of experience
working part-time at our hotel.

11
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,986
Should we make him the manager
of the restaurant on the first floor,

12
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:10,987
or something like that?

13
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,239
He received the top score
for OPIc and TOEIC,

14
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,241
and an outstanding score
for the aptitude test.

15
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:18,995
But everyone here can speak
that much English, right?

16
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:26,669
In this global era,
it's a given to speak a few languages.

17
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,631
A given!

18
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:31,091
HOTEL MYEONGSEONG
RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW ROOM

19
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,262
You're right, sir.

20
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:42,602
I've become very attached to this company
while working part-time.

21
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,316
If you hire me, I'll dedicate myself
to realizing your great purpose.

22
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,445
Please let me work here.

23
00:01:58,076 --> 00:01:58,952
Not bad.

24
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,876
INTERVIEW ROOM

25
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,261
So what if he's the owner's son?

26
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:21,933
And this is all they're giving me
for the interview?

27
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,158
Hello.

28
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:42,036
A time to get prettier.
I'm Oh Yeojin of Oh Yeojin's Beauty Time.

29
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,539
-Did you perhaps try using the product…
-She's on a roll.

30
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:47,250
…I introduced last week?

31
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:50,170
I did, and it sure felt different.

32
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:55,133
Let's help those job seekers out there
get moist and elastic skin.

33
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,759
By giving more elasticity to your skin…

34
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,512
The broadcasting stations
are having a field day with your hit show.

35
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:02,307
How about you make it a series
with Fashion Time and Money Time?

36
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,642
I'm a businesswoman, not a celebrity.

37
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,979
You need to stop relying on me
to run your business.

38
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,398
You can't make any money
for General Entertainment this way.

39
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,944
What about Amikus' party on Saturday?

40
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,906
I need to make money.
I'm meeting with a Japanese buyer.

41
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,699
"I'm meeting with a Japanese buyer."

42
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,159
Bye.

43
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,789
I should have partnered up with Yeojin,
instead of getting in Entertainment.

44
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:32,462
Who is it now?

45
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,424
It sure felt different.

46
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:39,928
Hello, Park Janggun speaking.

47
00:03:40,511 --> 00:03:41,721
Na Juhee?

48
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:46,059
I see, Janggun. It can't be helped then.

49
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,936
I'll see you another time. Bye.

50
00:03:56,945 --> 00:04:00,156
Both of them have plans for the weekend.
Oh Yeojin and Park Janggun won't be there.

51
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,617
Okay! I think we can go ahead with it.

52
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,619
Ms. Na, Ms. Wang.

53
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,913
Are you sure about this gambling
within Amikus?

54
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:10,500
Messing with them the wrong way
won't end with a letter of apology.

55
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,417
So…

56
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,338
…let's please do a good job.

57
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:16,923
Goodness.

58
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:20,134
Goodness, gracious.

59
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,095
That sly jerk.

60
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:24,722
He's totally scared
that we're after conglomerates.

61
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,558
I've asked Seungcheon
to arrange everything.

62
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,559
Okay.

63
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,770
Right, Hwang Taeyong.

64
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:33,690
Rumor says he got engaged
to Oh Yeojin in the States.

65
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:35,733
He hasn't been in Korea
for the last ten years.

66
00:04:36,484 --> 00:04:38,111
He'd come back for his wedding, right?

67
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:40,280
Before that,

68
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:43,533
we'd have to go to Amikus' party.

69
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,814
Yeah, Seungcheon. I got in.

70
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,357
Thanks.

71
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,692
I see, Juhee.

72
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,862
Be careful not to get caught.

73
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:22,739
It's been confirmed. Enjoy your time.

74
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,408
May I see your invitation?

75
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,911
You cannot enter without an invitation.

76
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,538
Only the invited guests are allowed in.

77
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:32,707
Please show me your invitation.

78
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,877
-It's been confirmed.
-Enjoy your time.

79
00:05:37,712 --> 00:05:39,547
-Sir, hello.
-Hi.

80
00:05:40,715 --> 00:05:41,549
Oh.

81
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,303
I've seen you somewhere.

82
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:47,764
I was at the final round interview
of Myeongseong Hotel.

83
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:50,641
My junior, Seungcheon, right?

84
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:53,478
He went to Seoul Jeil High.

85
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,771
Is that so?

86
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,940
-Huh. Keep up the hard work.
-Yes, sir.

87
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,776
-Please enjoy your time.
-Thanks.

88
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,405
-Who is he?
-Don't you know him?

89
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:07,784
He's the head of Dosin Hightech
or something.

90
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,160
Hwang Hyeondo's brother-in-law.

91
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,788
Seo Juntae?

92
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,833
If he's your junior, he's probably rich.
Why does he work part-time?

93
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,960
Maybe he has no money.

94
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:21,756
But he's really good at speaking French.

95
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:23,633
Hi.

96
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:25,635
You should hire him then.

97
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,262
No, I dropped him.

98
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:30,431
He hasn't even been abroad,

99
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,684
but his pronunciation's better than mine.
It annoys me.

100
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,979
Annoying guys like him
are the ones making money for you.

101
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,525
You're right, but he's way too annoying.

102
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,238
By the way, rumor says that you'll
push Taeyong aside and take over Dosin.

103
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:48,282
So what brings the busy man here?

104
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,534
I'm looking for someone.

105
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:50,993
Who?

106
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,745
Let's clink.

107
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:59,043
What's this? Who ordered it?

108
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:01,921
We were told to serve a bottle
for each table, sir.

109
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,506
Who told you that?

110
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,969
Let's go!

111
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:17,770
Shh.

112
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,397
Amikus!

113
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,947
Yeah!

114
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:32,034
Let's go!

115
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:34,162
JUHEE

116
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,746
Why isn't she picking up?

117
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,087
Are you sure Taeyong is here?

118
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:46,048
I'm telling you.
Didn't you even know that he came back?

119
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,675
That's not important right now.

120
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,010
Just find him.

121
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,303
All right, ma'am.

122
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:51,804
I'm Park Janggun.

123
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,974
That darn Hwang Taeyong.

124
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,476
I'll make sure to find him.

125
00:07:56,559 --> 00:07:59,228
Look forward to it, Oh Yeojin.
I'll bring him to you.

126
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,203
Sorry.

127
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,631
-You look much better in person.
-Nice pick-up line.

128
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,634
I'm Hwang Taeyong of Dosin.
Come with me to my room.

129
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,010
-Right now?
-No.

130
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:33,513
Hmm. After having a little fun here.

131
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,268
-Should we get a room for you?
-What the…

132
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,605
Ms. Oh.

133
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,900
A popular actress should behave better.

134
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:48,903
He's even dating an idol singer.
Are you okay with a love triangle scandal?

135
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,821
Are you kidding me?

136
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,532
Hey, at least give me your number…

137
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,159
Jeez, it was going great.

138
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,994
Snap out of it, will you?

139
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,829
What if someone writes
an article about this?

140
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,915
Oh.

141
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:03,417
My fiancée is much sexier
when she gets mad.

142
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:05,962
People are watching. Let's go.

143
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,547
Where are you going?

144
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,843
Want to sleep over?

145
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,555
Stop being silly. Let's just leave.

146
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,723
No, I don't want to!
And I didn't do anything wrong.

147
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:19,934
You can leave if you want. I'm staying.

148
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,062
Taeyong. Hey!

149
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,910
Your drink is here.

150
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,412
Please enjoy your time.

151
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:49,380
It's not going to work today.
Let's give up.

152
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,882
Why? Did the tip turn out to be false?

153
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:55,720
I don't know.
These people just aren't gambling.

154
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,015
They're playing board games instead.

155
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:04,270
Hey, that's it. Board games.

156
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,607
When I was younger,

157
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,234
I heard that you bet money
if you play board games in Amikus.

158
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,653
That it's a real gamble.

159
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,957
-Goodness.
-Here it comes.

160
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:27,001
-Let's go.
-Hey.

161
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:29,086
-It's time to pay.
-No.

162
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,547
-Hurry and pay.
-What a shame.

163
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,049
Let's go.

164
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,425
Sit down first.

165
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:37,345
-Six! All right, we got you.
-Oh, come on!

166
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,514
-Today's the day for me.
-Goodness.

167
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,892
-He's so good.
-WOMAN 2:You're too good.

168
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,228
-Go!
-Come on!

169
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,396
Let's go!

170
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,814
They have 4 of 500,000-won bills,

171
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,316
10 of 100,000-won bills,

172
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,401
and 5 of bills less than 50,000 won each.

173
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,487
The betting's about 3.5 million won
per person.

174
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,739
But times this by 100,

175
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:59,241
that's 350 million won per person.

176
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,118
So, 1.4 billion won per game?

177
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,536
-And?
-Hurry and pay up.

178
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,955
Right, did you guys year?

179
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:09,168
There's a start-up company on the Nasdaq
that's exiting for 500 billion won.

180
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,419
What was the name?

181
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,505
I know. Most Lab, right?

182
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:14,090
Yeah, that's right.

183
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,593
-Most Lab? I've heard of that name.
-Why isn't Juntae coming back?

184
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:19,011
Maybe he just ran off.

185
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,805
I wouldn't do that.

186
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:22,348
Just kidding.

187
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:24,809
You'd never do that.

188
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:28,062
You already started playing without me?

189
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:29,980
Why aren't you betting cash?

190
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,650
-Sit down first.
-You guys are boring.

191
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,152
Jeez.

192
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,030
We're betting with property today.

193
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:41,951
Juntae, you could bet your
Jeju golf membership.

194
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:44,495
Janggun, you should join us.

195
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:46,205
No, I'll play next time.

196
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,792
I cannot leave my Yeojin alone outside!

197
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,837
Park Janggun, let me pour you
a drink before you go.

198
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,339
-Why not?
-Raise.

199
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,924
Hey, you.

200
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,012
Bring us one more glass.

201
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,519
Wait.

202
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,066
Forget it. We have one here.

203
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,737
Please enjoy your time.

204
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,196
Okay, bye.

205
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:21,323
Thank you.

206
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,880
-Let go!
-Come here.

207
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,882
You're mistaken. I'm telling you! Wait.

208
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,801
-Gosh, it hurts so much.
-I said, it wasn't me.

209
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,511
You're weird.

210
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,472
Move. What is wrong with you people?

211
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,724
I said no.

212
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:08,037
Long time no see, Na Juhee.

213
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,503
Hwang Taeyong?

214
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:19,256
I thought you were a screenwriter.
What's with that uniform?

215
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,341
Ah!

216
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:22,843
Is this an undercover research
or something?

217
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,888
You even do such a thing? That's cool.

218
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,934
Right. I heard that
you looked everywhere for me.

219
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:31,477
Why?

220
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,562
Did you miss me?

221
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,027
No, I just wanted to ask you something.

222
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,279
Ask me something? What?

223
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:45,074
If I killed your father?

224
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:46,951
Hey, it wasn't me.

225
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,328
Why would I? I had no reason to.

226
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:51,247
Then why did you
suddenly run off to the States?

227
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,791
And why did Ms. Kim die of an accident?

228
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,042
Can you explain all this?

229
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,545
I can't. I didn't do it, so how can I?

230
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:03,133
Juhee, let's stop this boring talk

231
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:06,428
and just have a drink.

232
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:10,182
We were once engaged, you know.

233
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:11,183
Juhee.

234
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:13,727
Goodness, watch the drink.

235
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,690
-Hwang Taeyong?
-Lee Seungcheon?

236
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,191
What are you doing here?

237
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,653
Juhee, did this bastard
do something to you?

238
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,698
Gosh, I was just trying to be friendly.

239
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:29,368
By the way, are you two still dating?

240
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,746
Yes, we are. What's that to you?

241
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:36,250
I don't think so. Look at her face.

242
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:39,169
Don't overdo it just because I'm here.

243
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,880
Just be natural.

244
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,924
Rumor said that you became
a dirtbag in the States,

245
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,634
but this is worse than I thought.

246
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,887
Seungcheon, let's go.

247
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,599
Wait, Juhee.

248
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,976
Don't leave like this.
Have a drink with me.

249
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,728
What are you doing? Let go.

250
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,646
-No, I won't let go.
-What's this?

251
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,357
-You guys were together?
-Hey, Hwang Taeyong.

252
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,483
Yeojin.

253
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,402
I told you to let go of me.

254
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:07,239
We only held hands.
We didn't do anything. Right?

255
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,199
Call Seongwon over.

256
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:12,161
We've found the rats he's looking for.

257
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:14,371
-Let go!
-Wait, just hear me out!

258
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:16,665
Goodness!

259
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:19,418
Are you okay?

260
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,379
Isn't this too much?

261
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:25,049
You shouldn't have tried
to cover this party illegally.

262
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,759
Let's just have fun.

263
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:28,552
Taeyong, behind you.

264
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,931
I see a lot of familiar faces.
And one of them is my nephew.

265
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:35,601
What are you doing here, Uncle?

266
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:36,810
I came to see you.

267
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,521
I heard you came back
but didn't hear from you.

268
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:42,066
Well… I was a little busy.

269
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,860
No, that's not it.
It seemed you were busy.

270
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,698
By the way, you've gotten a lot cooler.

271
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:56,705
Juhee, I'm really sorry
I didn't recognize you back there.

272
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,832
But what is all this?

273
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,086
Where's that thing? The spy camera.

274
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:03,671
You came to film a video.

275
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:07,633
Here it is.

276
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,889
How dare you film us in secret?

277
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:18,310
What are you doing?
It's true you were gambling illegally.

278
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,437
Why you little…

279
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,857
If you have nothing to hide,
why don't you just call the police?

280
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,235
The police?

281
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,029
This guy is funny.

282
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:33,617
What's your name? "Lee Seungcheon?"

283
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,955
Seongwon, aren't you being too easy
on your junior?

284
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,790
No!

285
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,168
Gosh, that hurts.

286
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,006
This is your fault.

287
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:52,094
Uncle, I got slapped on his behalf,
so could you please let them go?

288
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,804
What are you talking about?

289
00:16:53,887 --> 00:16:56,765
Did you tell me to call the police?
Sure, I'll do that.

290
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,767
Come on, Seongwon. No.

291
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,562
My uncle's the head of Dosin Hightech.

292
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,397
He may be in trouble if people hear

293
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,607
that he slapped
poor, powerless part-timers like them.

294
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,402
What are you doing?

295
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,947
Well, I'm just worried about you.

296
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,452
And don't you feel bad for them?

297
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,248
Never mind. You can do as you wish.

298
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,710
I'll let them go.

299
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:26,670
Really?

300
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,172
Since you are

301
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,092
this worried about me,

302
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,512
I should let them go.

303
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,851
-I won't let it go next time.
-Sure.

304
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,271
Especially you.

305
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:52,488
I guess that's settled. Thank goodness.

306
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:57,701
Yeojin.

307
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,079
Don't tell my father about this.

308
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,873
Juhee, are you okay?

309
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:05,501
Mm.

310
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:10,964
Hwang Taeyong has changed a lot.

311
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,759
It was strange
when he suddenly left for the States.

312
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:15,761
Did something happen to him?

313
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,765
I'm sorry, Seungcheon.

314
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:21,642
You got fired because of me.

315
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:25,187
Forget it. If you're that sorry, get me
another gig at the broadcasting station.

316
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,234
-Return this, all right?
-Honey, you can't do that.

317
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,985
Why not? He's just a mere part-timer.

318
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,153
I'm sorry.

319
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,448
Don't mind him, Juhee. He's a guest here.

320
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,200
Being rich doesn't mean he can do this.

321
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:43,539
It would be unfair if rich people
even had nice characters.

322
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,708
Poor people can at least feel proud
thanks to those jerks.

323
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,880
Let's go, my friend.

324
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,926
Our mood is ruined, so I'll treat you
to some pork belly and soju.

325
00:18:57,219 --> 00:18:58,053
Let's go.

326
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:04,017
I don't want to be
just friends with you though.

327
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:09,064
Hey, why aren't you coming? Let's go.

328
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,024
I'm coming.

329
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:15,988
-Pork belly.
-And soju?

330
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,450
Bye!

331
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,871
That prick.

332
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,498
What did you talk about with Juhee?

333
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:27,833
Nothing much.

334
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:32,588
Why did Uncle Juntae have to show up
just then? I couldn't even have fun.

335
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,049
Seo Juntae's always on your case.
Aren't you angry at all?

336
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,092
I am.

337
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,053
But I have to put up with him.
What else can I do?

338
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:41,680
Relax.

339
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,226
Gosh, that startled me. What was that?

340
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:51,440
Do you think I lent you money, helped you,
and waited for you to watch this mess?

341
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:53,400
You didn't lend it to me for free.

342
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,152
I gave you my golden spoon.

343
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,320
Taeyong.

344
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,824
My life is in your hands,
so what's making you unhappy?

345
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,035
Are you worried I might not get Dosin?

346
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:05,412
That's true. I can't beat my uncle.

347
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,166
If you're going to live like this,
just go back to being poor Lee Seungcheon.

348
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:12,085
I don't want to.
I like being Hwang Taeyong.

349
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,129
I may not be the heir of Dosin,

350
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,340
but I have lots of money.

351
00:20:16,423 --> 00:20:18,717
I'm sorry, but I won't put up with it.

352
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,263
Stop honking. It's noisy.

353
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,687
What? Who are you?

354
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:32,856
What are you doing?

355
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,566
Hey! What the…

356
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,527
Who are you people? I'm Hwang Taeyong!

357
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,655
Yeojin, where are they taking me? Hey!

358
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:43,158
I'm Hwang Taeyong! Who are you guys?

359
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,286
Oh Yeojin! I'm sorry.

360
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,412
Yes, Father.

361
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,249
Taeyong will be home soon.

362
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,460
Hey, how dare you touch me?

363
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:56,546
You're dead meat.
I'll remember all your faces.

364
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,676
Let go of me! Put me down!

365
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,636
That's right. I'm down.

366
00:21:07,099 --> 00:21:07,975
Father.

367
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,518
Come to my study.

368
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,984
How did he end up…

369
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,111
I can't believe this.

370
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:26,118
He brought it upon himself.

371
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,747
Why did you suddenly come back to Korea?

372
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:34,042
I was just bored.

373
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:35,919
I felt lonely too.

374
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,087
Just what…

375
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,716
are you thinking?

376
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,843
Nothing really.

377
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,054
Nothing at all?

378
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:48,140
There's nothing I can do.

379
00:21:48,223 --> 00:21:50,517
I have no shares, no power.

380
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,563
My father isn't willing
to help his only son either.

381
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,941
I was wrong.

382
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,028
I overestimated you.

383
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:03,864
You can go now.

384
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,620
I don't want to.

385
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:15,500
I'll stay and say what I have to say.

386
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:19,254
What you have to say?

387
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:42,110

The case is closed.
It was just an accident.

00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,725
Please.

402
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,145
Miss, please stop bothering me.

Oh Hyunpil, the head of the investigation.

404
00:24:00,105 --> 00:24:01,940
He resigned and joined Dosin Security.

405
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,568
Currently, he runs a studio lease business
worth seven billion won.

406
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,076
Come on. It wasn't an accidental death.

407
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:16,413
If you come here again,
I'll call the police.

408
00:24:16,496 --> 00:24:17,873
Yoo Sungsoo, the medical examiner.

409
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,333
He resigned and became a director
of Dosin Medical Foundation.

410
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,544
Currently, he runs a nursing home
worth ten billion won.

411
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,633
The last person your father met--

412
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,345
Kim Nayoung, the butler.

413
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,638
After resigning from our house,

414
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,891
she tried to join DS Resort
but ended up dying.

415
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,810
All three of them are connected to Dosin.

416
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:44,441
But these aren't enough for evidence.

SPICY CLAM STEW

418
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,586
Here. Let me pour you a drink.

419
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:11,968
Cheers.

420
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,393
Let's see…

421
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,734
Oh!

422
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,364
How spicy. It's perfect
to have a drink with.

423
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,490
Tell me about it.

424
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:37,619
So, did Hwang Taeyong tell you
that he didn't kill your father?

425
00:25:38,912 --> 00:25:40,830
There's no way he'd tell the truth.

426
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:43,583
I had so many questions,

427
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,670
but I got worked up and couldn't ask much.

428
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:51,007
Are you still digging
into your father's case?

429
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:53,969
No, I put it aside a few years ago.

430
00:25:54,469 --> 00:25:56,429
I feel bad for my dad,

431
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,140
but I also needed to live on.

432
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,894
I'm sure he understands.

433
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,398
But aren't you going
to tell Seungcheon about it?

434
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,692
His life is tough enough already.

435
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,361
I don't want him to worry about me too.

436
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:15,490
Juhee, I've realized something
after being an investigative journalist

437
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:16,950
for more than ten years.

438
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:21,121
The truth always gets out,

439
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,831
no matter what.

440
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:25,000
-Right?
-Right.

441
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:27,919
Cheers.

442
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,845
WE SPECIALIZE IN SALES, LEASES, LOTS

443
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,144
I thought you stopped coming.
Why are you here again?

444
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,396
To say hello.

445
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,398
How have you been?

446
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,901
I have no business with you whatsoever.

447
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:55,155
I already told you. We found nothing
when we searched the scene!

448
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:58,033
Exactly, and that always makes me curious.

449
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,994
I've read books and had tea
in my father's study,

450
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,621
so why didn't you find any of my traces?

451
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,875
You should've at least found
my hair or fingerprints.

452
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:11,338
I hear everyone leaves a trace, no?

453
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,800
Do you know what your problem is?
You always go around in circles.

454
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:19,429
And that's because you're digging
into a perfectly clean case!

455
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:20,930
Move.

456
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,228
That's because you people
got rid of the evidence.

457
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,026
Mr. Oh, I'll come again.

458
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,446
Jaedon's Your Money My Money.

459
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,447
Dear subscribers,

460
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,283
that's it for today's
money-making stock report.

461
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,201
Guys.

462
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:43,578
May you become filthy rich.

463
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:44,871
Bye!

464
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:49,042
Couldn't you see me on air?

465
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,710
Hey, I…

466
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,047
I didn't get into Myeongseong Hotel.

467
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,758
WE'RE SORRY WE CANNOT HIRE YOU
DESPITE YOUR OUTSTANDING COMPETENCY

468
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,260
Did you think you'd get in? You're crazy.

469
00:27:59,469 --> 00:28:01,721
Then you shouldn't have assisted
that secret coverage.

470
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:05,475
You idiot. If I were the executive,
I wouldn't hire you either.

471
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,896
If you want to keep streaming
from my room,

472
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,815
watch what you say.

473
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:13,358
Speaking of which,

474
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:16,653
why did you even break up with Juhee
if you're this concerned about her?

475
00:28:16,736 --> 00:28:20,323
It's not like she blamed you
for losing her 500 million won.

476
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,451
What's so great
about that sense of guilt--

477
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,495
Shut your mouth.

478
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,540
I'd love to kick you out right now,

479
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,959
but I'm putting up with you
for your wife's and twins' sake.

480
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:34,087
Damn you. I'm going to get rich soon
so I can escape this place.

481
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,505
This is too humiliating.

482
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,382
Right, you know the company
Dongkyung works at?

483
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:38,925
-Most Lab?
-Yes.

484
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,635
It will be listed on the stock market.

485
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,512
Whoever owns the company
will make a fortune.

486
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:44,264
I'm jealous.

487
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,350
If I can get my hands on such money,

488
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,520
I'll pay Juhee back.

489
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,397
You're pathetic.

490
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,066
Your life started to get twisted
when you turned down that offer.

491
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,318
Who was that, Alex Boo? Him.

492
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,529
Alex Boo…

493
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,905
What, 500 million won?

494
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,785
I called you over to teach you
because you have an eye for things,

495
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,663
and you want me
to lend you 500 million? Why?

496
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,206
I lost

497
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,126
my dear friend's money.

498
00:29:14,794 --> 00:29:18,256
If you lend me that much,
I'll do anything.

499
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:28,600
Let's start with 1.5 million a month.
You'll get a 10% raise every year.

500
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:32,187
If you work hard and make results,
it can even be 20 or 30%.

501
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,521
Ten years.

502
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:36,274
Work under me for just ten years.

503
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,943
You'll have more than just 500 million.

504
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,449
RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW ROOM

505
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,254
A BANK THAT SAVES PEOPLE
SHINMYUNG BANK

506
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,549
I should've just said yes then.

507
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,435
Hello?

508
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:14,979
What?

509
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,232
Hwang Taeyong?

510
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:29,160
Hey.

511
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,414
Hey, wake up.

512
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:39,212
Where am I?

513
00:30:46,135 --> 00:30:47,303
Oh.

514
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,682
Ah.

515
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,851
Look at you.

516
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,270
Hey, you.

517
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,108
Why are you in this mess?

518
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,610
You're still so cranky.

519
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,160
What's wrong with a grownup son
having a drink?

520
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,329
He even suspended my credit card.

521
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:14,914
It's just too much.

522
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:18,126
I couldn't pay for the drink,
and I even lost my shoes.

523
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:19,460
Hey, check this out.

524
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:22,922
I got a hole in my sock too.

525
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:25,508
Move it.

526
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:29,512
This dumpling soup is to die for.

527
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,472
It's my favorite food.

528
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,517
So what?

529
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,978
You called a job seeker out
to buy dumpling soup for you?

530
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,398
Why didn't you ask your secretary
or whatever for it?

531
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,692
My secretary? Oh, Munki?

532
00:31:42,775 --> 00:31:44,819
Hey, I fired him a long time ago.

533
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,447
He kept telling on me to my father.

534
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:52,785
Ah, how are your parents?

535
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,580
I'm sure they're okay.
I was just asking to be nice.

536
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:57,415
Keep eating.

537
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:03,087
Hey, let me tell you something
while I'm here with you.

538
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,797
I heard you're engaged to Oh Yeojin.

539
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,176
I'll kill you
if you try to hit on Juhee again.

540
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,138
You'll kill me?

541
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,933
-That's scary. Okay, I get it.
-A member of a global idol group…

542
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:16,434
-Don't worry.
-…is said to be

543
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,728
in a relationship
with the only son of the D Group family.

544
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,230
Reporter Si Eunjin has more on the story.

545
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,358
-The idol singer…
-Hey, that's me.

546
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,193
-…and D Group's son's scandal.
-Hey.

547
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:27,904
-Apparently, they had met at a club…
-This is crazy. I'm on the news.

548
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,782
-…and developed feelings for each other.
-I'd better take pictures of it.

549
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:34,827
And recently, they were spotted
at a hotel swimming pool,

550
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:37,455
-kissing and hugging each other.
-Seungcheon, join me.

551
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,166
A scandal about D Group's only son
and an idol singer.

552
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,377
It's Taeyong, right?

553
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:48,424
No, Dad. Who said that?

554
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,801
As if.

555
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,136
Only a while ago,
he got caught in Las Vegas with a girl

556
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,014
who was practically naked in some movie,
and he's at it again.

557
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,266
I'm calling President Hwang
to complain about this.

558
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,267
Dad!

559
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,648
I said it wasn't him.

560
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,984
Then you should believe me!

561
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,112
Yes, right.

562
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,031
I believe what my daughter says.
I do, but--

563
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:15,451
If you want your daughter
to be Dosin Group's lady,

564
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:17,370
just don't do anything.

565
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:19,455
I'll take care of it all.

566
00:33:22,291 --> 00:33:24,711
That brat's so cold.
Who did she get it from?

567
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:44,856
Lee Seungcheon,

568
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,818
when in the world
will you come to your senses?

569
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,769
IMAGE

570
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,944
Apparently, President Hwang married her
because she looked like his late wife.

571
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,281
Shh! Watch your mouth.

572
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,825
Do you want to get your husband fired
at the next reshuffle?

573
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,535
Watch what you say.

574
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:20,076
Thank you.

575
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:22,870
As you must already know,

576
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:25,123
they are the wife of the Senior Secretary,

577
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:27,208
and the wife of the Minister
of Strategy and Finance.

578
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,463
There's one more person.

579
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,174
He is my younger brother.

580
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:36,634
Ooh.

581
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,636
I'm Seo Juntae, the CEO of Dosin Hightech.

582
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,596
Today,

583
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,058
I'm here for the lights.

584
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:57,321
Taeyong's truly hopeless.

585
00:35:59,031 --> 00:36:00,324
Did you read today's article?

586
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,994
Apparently,
Attorney Ko can't stop every article.

587
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:05,997
I was behind it.

588
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:07,707
No wonder.

589
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,668
I'm just grateful
that he causes trouble every day.

590
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:13,004
I'm going to release more.

591
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:16,716
Okay, then you just have to get through
the upcoming board meeting.

592
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:19,969
Get reappointed, and the next
is becoming vice president.

593
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,680
You know the heir of Dosin
will be determined

594
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,599
by this board meeting, right?

595
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:27,852
I'm not worried because you're on my side.

596
00:36:28,436 --> 00:36:31,522
I'm keeping a close eye on Taeyong,
so don't mind him.

597
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,317
All right.

598
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:45,953
Whoo!

599
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,047
Here. Thanks for your work.

600
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:00,218
Have you used a revolving door before?

601
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:10,186
Munkyu, this is my dad's hotel.

602
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,273
So I reserved the best room here.

603
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,650
Gosh, I dropped the key card.

604
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,578
Munkyu.

605
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:35,711
Hey.

606
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:46,681
Please be thorough
with the given materials.

607
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:02,488
Mr. Jang, you're such a beauty.

608
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,658
All thanks to a certain someone.

609
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:09,370
But did you have to kiss me there, honey?

610
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,330
-"Honey?"
-I mean, young master.

611
00:38:13,374 --> 00:38:14,250
Sorry.

612
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:17,044
We have no time. Let's start the meeting.

613
00:38:20,047 --> 00:38:21,090
It was my first kiss.

614
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:22,842
You need to thoroughly check

615
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,927
the negotiation progress
with Robochase in the US.

616
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,596
Don't forget to ask our angel investors
to keep it classified.

617
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,931
-Yes, sir.
-Understood.

618
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:32,101
But must we exit?

619
00:38:32,184 --> 00:38:35,021
The company's valuation is high
and we have high technical skills.

620
00:38:35,896 --> 00:38:36,731
It's such a waste.

621
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:40,735
Now is the time to go further.

622
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,322
Further and longer, right?

623
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,117
Right. How did it go
with the accountant, Kim Inchul?

624
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,287
Uh, he certainly has evidence,

625
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,122
but it's not too easy.

626
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:56,250
You must convince him. He's the key man
if we're to get Seo Juntae.

627
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:57,918
Yes, sir.

628
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,465
Let's call it a day.
I'll get going. Be careful, everyone.

629
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,550
-Yes, sir.
-Of course, sir.

630
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,509
-Good work.
-Good work.

631
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:06,594
Good work, everyone.

632
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,436
Jeez.

633
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,813
What is this, an intelligence mission?

634
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,441
Is Seo Juntae that frightening?

635
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,235
You know what?

636
00:39:23,736 --> 00:39:24,820
When we were in the States,

637
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,949
there were car accidents
everywhere the young master went.

638
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,077
And people tried to shoot him.

639
00:39:32,495 --> 00:39:36,040
That was all Seo Juntae's doing?

640
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,918
Yes.

641
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:43,047
It's a miracle that he's still alive.

642
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,378
2017, US STATE HOSPITAL

643
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,922
Come on, help me out here.

644
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,550
You're the only one

645
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:29,718
who can help me right now.

646
00:40:49,947 --> 00:40:52,283
SUCCESS AFTER SUCCESS
SIDE DISH STORE

647
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,791
This doesn't make sense!

648
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:03,711
This amount of incredibly
delicious jangjorim,

649
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,171
is only 4,000 won?

650
00:41:05,254 --> 00:41:06,755
Unbelievable.

651
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:08,466
It's all thanks to you, sir.

652
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:11,427
You rented us a house and a store
at such a low price.

653
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,679
-Thank you so much.
-No.

654
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,139
-Give it to him.
-Okay.

655
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,224
We can support ourselves now,

656
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,767
so you should raise the monthly rent.

657
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,894
-Yes.
-Sungah is working,

658
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:22,271
and Seungcheon will also get a job soon.

659
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,941
Don't worry.

660
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,527
There's someone else looking out for you.

661
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:29,695
Who?

662
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,198
Who?

663
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,244
Well, the Almighty.

664
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,162
Hallelujah.

665
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,330
-Amen.
-Amen.

666
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,668
Hey, Seungcheon. If you can't get a job,
just work at my office.

667
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,505
Investing in stocks or crypto
is no use in this country.

668
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:49,798
Investing in real estate is the best.

669
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,175
I see.

670
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:53,469
Mmm.

671
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,596
-I shouldn't touch it.
-Right.

672
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,181
-Get him some.
-Do you want some? Sure.

673
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,475
Hello?

674
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:00,684
This is the police station.

675
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:02,478
Myeongseong Hotel has sued you

676
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,104
-for obstruction of business.
-What?

677
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:09,527
Sir.

678
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,362
-Wait, sir.
-Jeez.

679
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:13,864
This isn't right.

680
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:16,242
Aside from obstruction of business,

681
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:18,744
you'll be charged 100 million won
for psychological damage

682
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:21,580
caused by the joint illegal act
of violating portrait rights

683
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:23,290
and invading privacy.

684
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,333
No settlements.

685
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,001
If you're unhappy, file a countercharge.

686
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,004
-Wait, sir.
-Gosh.

687
00:42:31,298 --> 00:42:32,299
A 100 million…

688
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,678
Damn it.

689
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:40,057
What? They sued Seungcheon too?

690
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:41,725
Didn't he tell you?

691
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,978
Because he was their part-timer,

692
00:42:44,061 --> 00:42:47,231
they filed criminal and civil suits
against him

693
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,441
for obstruction of business and stuff.

694
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:52,528
That jerk, Choi Seongwon has gone insane.

695
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,196
Seungcheon has no money.

696
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,533
We'll take responsibility.

697
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,827
We? No.

698
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:02,871
Seungcheon's an adult too.
He needs to take his own responsibility.

699
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,039
That's truly for his sake.

700
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:07,042
What are you saying?
Hurry and call the Legal Team right now.

701
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:11,255
Uh, why isn't he answering his phone?

702
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,174
Cheers to the future of Amikus!

703
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,385
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

704
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,347
-Hey, it's been a long time.
-I know.

705
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,725
You too. Have you been well?

706
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:24,685
You've gotten prettier.

707
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,314
Those with nothing are always the problem.

708
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,442
I'm busy managing my global company,

709
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:34,236
so why must I deal with dregs like him?

710
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,363
Well, I should.

711
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:38,949
Now repeat after me.

712
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,869
"What I've done is unforgivable."

713
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,287
Say it.

714
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:45,706
What I've done is unforgivable.

715
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,250
Gosh, he's being too serious.

716
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,086
In French.

717
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:52,796
What I've done is unforgivable.

718
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:57,176
-He sounds so fluent.
-Right? Hey, say something else.

719
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,137
You need to do your best.

720
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,056
-Come on.
-Seongwon.

721
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:03,891
Knock it off.

722
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,227
All right.

723
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:10,022
-Janggun, send him off now.
-Okay.

724
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,567
Hey, get up now. Drink this and leave.

725
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,573
Here.

726
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:25,579
Goodness.

727
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,624
Goodness, you…

728
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:34,963
Are you dropping the suit, then?

729
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,550
Against Juhee, me, and the others.

730
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:41,387
Yes, I will.

731
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,306
I won't get anything
out of suing you anyway.

732
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:46,475
I just dropped the suit, so you can go.

733
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:49,728
Thank you.

734
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:53,607
Don't thank me
because I'm much more grateful.

735
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,359
Thank Taeyong instead.

736
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:59,738
Myeongseong F&B is supplying goods
to Dosin now.

737
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,074
Congrats!

738
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:05,494
Thanks to your friendship,
how much did I earn?

739
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,538
Thanks.

740
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,539
Thank you.

741
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:10,833
Thank you!

742
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,211
Guys, it's on me today. Eat up.

743
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:16,588
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

744
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:36,525
You managed to find your way here
through the alleys.

745
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,403
I came here in high school.

746
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:42,865
You drank all these alone?

747
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:45,033
You can hold your liquor, can't you?

748
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,370
Hey.

749
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,833
I worked part-time here
at this convenience store for a long time.

750
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:57,463
How much did I earn here in total?

751
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,257
Still, it'd be less than 100 million.

752
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:04,636
Taeyong, you've never
worked part-time before, have you?

753
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:10,017
You probably haven't had
expired triangular gimbap to save money.

754
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:14,021
And you must not have stuck
your head on the floor miserably

755
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:18,025
in front of people because of money.

756
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:28,660
You told me once before.

757
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,122
That the poor must avoid
getting into a fight.

758
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,585
Today, I tried my best to hold out
with what you said in mind.

759
00:46:38,337 --> 00:46:40,255
I did everything as I was told,

760
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,841
so I wouldn't have to pay 100 million.

761
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:47,012
But that wasn't why he let it slide.

762
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,850
It was all thanks to you.

763
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,353
I tried so hard, you see.

764
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:57,940
Hey, it wasn't thanks to me.

765
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:01,109
Seongwon and Dosin signed a deal
because it was needed.

766
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:02,694
Don't bother.

767
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:06,240
Hey, you just made me feel

768
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,575
more miserable by saying that.

769
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,622
Anyway, thanks.

770
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,878
There's nothing I can do for you.

771
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,173
So today, let's call it even
with this drink.

772
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,141
Seungcheon.

773
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,811
Juhee. Come on, let's have a drink.

774
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,648
I didn't know you were with Hwang Taeyong.

775
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,987
I felt so good today
that I asked him to drink with me.

776
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:47,281
I heard you helped drop the suit.

777
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,992
-What did you do so wrong to Seungcheon?
-"Wrong"?

778
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:53,954
Hey, I helped him out
with good intentions.

779
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:56,415
-We're friends.
-Really?

780
00:47:56,498 --> 00:47:59,126
Rich people spend money on others
for just two reasons.

781
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,963
Hmm, it's either worth the money
or they did something wrong.

782
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:06,258
Helping Seungcheon
wouldn't get you anything.

783
00:48:06,717 --> 00:48:07,634
So what did you do?

784
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,891
Jeez, you're talking too much
when all you need to say is "Thank you."

785
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:18,770
Why don't you choose one
between your pride and money?

786
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,524
Right, what's the use of acting so proud
before your money?

787
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:25,360
I should just be grateful, right?

788
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,616
What's with you guys?

789
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:33,243
All I wanted was to have a drink together.

790
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,455
Well, I'll just go home.

791
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:51,637
Right.

792
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,514
I wonder.

793
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,517
How much did you pay
to cover up my dad's death?

794
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,686
I'm really curious

795
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,730
about how much it cost.

796
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,026
Seungcheon.

797
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:08,862
-Yes?
-Goodness, you silly.

798
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,697
Let's drink some more.

799
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,450
What are you talking about?

800
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,214
I heard you helped them. Why?

801
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,384
That's not important.

802
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,469
Don't bother me with nothing.

803
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:34,471
Wasn't it because of Juhee?

804
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,307
You wanted to help Na Juhee.

805
00:49:38,892 --> 00:49:42,354
Tell me. Do you still
have feelings for her?

806
00:49:42,437 --> 00:49:43,730
What's making you so anxious?

807
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:49,403
I got engaged to you,
and I'm going to marry you.

808
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,697
I even gave you my golden spoon.

809
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,827
I gave you everything I could,

810
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,622
so why are you still so anxious?

811
00:50:01,248 --> 00:50:03,208
I can't trust you, Lee Seungcheon.

812
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,506
If I do this, will you trust me?

813
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:44,082
BOOK OF SOLUTIONS

814
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:56,887
THE HAPPINESS OF HAVING
A GOOD PERSON WITH YOU

815
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,773
I bought this with my first paycheck,

816
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,316
and I'm finally giving it to you.

817
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:11,777
Seungcheon, when you're troubled
or concerned,

818
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,487
open this book.

819
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:15,405
It may not be able to give you an answer,

820
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:17,532
but it will comfort and encourage you.

821
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:18,950
P.S.

822
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,620
Guess what I got
when I opened it just now.

823
00:51:21,703 --> 00:51:24,247
"The happiness of having
a good person with you."

824
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:25,707
Lee Seungcheon,

825
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,293
I'm so happy that I got to know you.

826
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:39,137
Do you still have feelings for her?

827
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:43,642
No.

828
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:46,019
I don't.

829
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,612
Let's go over the next item.

830
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:56,947
It's…

831
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,784
Gosh, Don's Best! Don Seller, you too?
Thank you so much!

832
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,577
Here I am becoming filthy rich!

833
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,247
DON'S BEST HAS DONATED 5 MILLION
DON SELLER HAS DONATED 1 MILLION

834
00:52:05,330 --> 00:52:08,416
Minor Stock, I really am
Hwang Taeyong's best friend.

835
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,876
Jeez.

836
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:13,380
Here, donate some if you feel sorry.

837
00:52:14,256 --> 00:52:17,259
Let's start
with my favorite Dosin Hightech.

838
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,553
Dosin Hightech.

839
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,013
DOSIN'S 4TH-GENERATION SON,
HWANG, INVESTIGATED FOR DRUGS

840
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,014
Wait.

841
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:25,183
Did something bad happen to Dosin Group?

842
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,811
HWANG, THE FOURTH-GENERATION SON OF DOSIN
BEING INVESTIGATED FOR USING DRUGS

843
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,439
Since the report about
the son of Dosin's president,

844
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:34,025
being suspected of drugs
came out on the ninth,

845
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,611
the stock price of Dosin Holdings
fell sharply by 10.2%

846
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,030
-within only a week.
-This is very bad.

847
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:41,575
The situation is the same
with Dosin Electronics.

848
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:43,994
MNS Global Investment Bank
criticized the risks…

849
00:52:44,077 --> 00:52:45,745
-This is perfect.
-…which may be caused

850
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,455
by big companies and their structures

851
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:49,583
in their report last year, and it's

852
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:52,002
gaining attention once again.

853
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,044
What is this?

854
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,796
DOSIN'S 4TH-GENERATION SON,
HWANG, INVESTIGATED FOR DRUGS

855
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,507
"Hwang, the fourth-generation son…"
Hwang Taeyong?

856
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,845
What happened? Hurry up and look into it.

857
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,805
Damn it.

858
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,516
HWANG TAEYONG

859
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,938
Why isn't he picking up?

860
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,401
Hey, Park Janggun!
Check Taeyong's article.

861
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,821
-Okay.
-Now!

862
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,656
Okay.

863
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:24,284
That Hwang Taeyong…

864
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,493
That Hwang Taeyong.

865
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:27,913
That bastard deserves it.

866
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:30,207
I knew this would happen.
Serves him right!

867
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:33,084
All the stock prices of Dosin affiliates
are dropping at the moment.

868
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:36,087
Even overseas investors
are selling their stocks,

869
00:53:36,171 --> 00:53:38,882
causing Dosin stocks to flood the market.

870
00:53:38,965 --> 00:53:41,301
-And each stock price is dropping
-Why can't I sell mine?

871
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,887
...even more sharply within the day.

872
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:47,098
Except for four affiliates of Dosin,

873
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:48,225
all the affiliates are

874
00:53:48,308 --> 00:53:50,018
-suffering from the downturn…
-It's now.

875
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,232
Start purchasing.

876
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,984
DOSIN'S 4TH-GENERATION SON,
HWANG, INVESTIGATED FOR DRUGS

877
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:03,865
Taeyong took drugs?

878
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:07,202
Who released such an article? Juntae?

879
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,995
Probably for the board meeting.

880
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,998
Every affiliate's stock price is falling.
I think we must respond quickly.

881
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,334
First, find Taeyong.
Then tell the Strategy Planning Team

882
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,710
to call an emergency meeting and…

883
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,296
Excuse me.

884
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:20,590
What is it?

885
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,550
What? Okay.

886
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,386
What is it?

887
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,847
Someone is purchasing
a large quantity of Dosin Hightech shares.

888
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:35,605
Me?

889
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:39,317
If I were going to buy the shares,
I would've let you know.

890
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:42,988
Then just who is buying the shares?

891
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,284
You said you didn't release the article
about Taeyong's drug use, right?

892
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,786
It doesn't feel right.

893
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:54,040
It's worth almost 500 billion won.

894
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,752
It's neither an institution
nor a foreigner.

895
00:54:57,836 --> 00:55:00,255
An individual has purchased this much.

896
00:55:01,756 --> 00:55:02,882
I wonder who it is.

897
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,469
I'll stay and say what I have to say.

898
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,595
All right.

899
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:15,020
Go ahead.

900
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,147
I told you

901
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:20,025
to wait just three years
no matter what I did.

902
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,151
Yes, I do remember that.

903
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,194
And my patience has a limit.

904
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,988
Yes, a week.

905
00:55:26,281 --> 00:55:28,283
Wait just a week longer.

906
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,660
I won't let you down.

907
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:44,841
Sir?

908
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,594
We won't need an emergency meeting.

909
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:48,803
Pardon?

910
00:55:49,846 --> 00:55:50,930
Cancel it all.

911
00:55:51,806 --> 00:55:54,601
This is a power struggle
over management rights?

912
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:58,897
A conglomerate can do anything
for their own good.

913
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:03,526
What's interesting is,
the true winner is someone else.

914
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,364
When the stock prices dropped
due to Hwang Taeyong's drug use,

915
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:10,575
a rich individual purchased
500 billion won worth

916
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,118
of Dosin Hightech's stock.

917
00:56:12,786 --> 00:56:15,246
I wonder who it is. Aren't you curious?

918
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:19,417
There's a start-up company on the NASDAQ
that's exiting for 500 billion won.

919
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:20,585
What was the name?

920
00:56:20,668 --> 00:56:23,213
I know. Most Lab, right?

921
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:28,426
A power struggle over management rights.
Five hundred billion won…

922
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,387
Most Lab.

923
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,274
COVER LETTER

924
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,327
Hi, Juhee.

925
00:57:37,579 --> 00:57:40,373
Seungcheon, Dongkyung works
at a company named Most Lab, right?

926
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:42,375
Yes. Why do you ask?

927
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:44,836
Thanks.

928
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:49,799
Juhee?

929
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,470
JUHEE

930
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:55,180
Is something going on?

931
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:12,780
"Seoul Jeil High?"

932
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,667
LOOK FOR THE OLD WOMAN TO CHANGE BACK.
LET'S NEVER USE IT AGAIN…

933
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:34,802
We will now begin
Dosin Hightech's regular board meeting.

934
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,264
The first agenda
is the reappointment of CEO Seo Juntae.

935
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,602
As an outside director,
I propose an urgent agenda.

936
00:58:42,936 --> 00:58:45,313
I suggest CEO Seo Juntae's dismissal.

937
00:59:02,956 --> 00:59:04,040
Please excuse us.

938
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,052
My dismissal?

939
00:59:16,135 --> 00:59:18,721
People are gossiping,
saying that I'm the one

940
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:21,182
who tipped off the press
about Taeyong's drug use.

941
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,392
Is it because of that?

942
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:27,522
-If then--
-The actual reason is something else.

943
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:47,250
These materials prove that
CEO Seo collected a slush fund worth

944
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:49,586
around 70 billion won
over the past 10 years.

945
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:55,049
During Dosin Hightech's
recapitalization in 2018,

946
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:57,260
he fabricated a loss
and embezzled 18 billion won.

947
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:01,556
He embezzled 12 billion won under the name
of wages and severance payments.

948
01:00:02,849 --> 01:00:05,018
He embezzled 37 billion won under the name

949
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:06,728
of supporting insolvent affiliates.

950
01:00:07,312 --> 01:00:09,606
What is going on?

951
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,150
I'm too ashamed to mention
his other corrupt deeds

952
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,152
such as nepotism hires and bribery.

953
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,406
This is a fraud.

954
01:00:18,489 --> 01:00:21,242
It's dumbfounding
and not even worth explaining.

955
01:00:21,326 --> 01:00:24,078
Besides, only a director has the right
to make a say in this meeting.

956
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:26,664
Hwang Taeyong has no right.

957
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:28,499
He does.

958
01:00:29,042 --> 01:00:30,627
We've brought in a new CEO

959
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,046
who'll lead Dosin Hightech
after CEO Seo's dismissal.

960
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:33,963
This is

961
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,467
CEO Hwang Taeyong of Most Lab.

962
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:45,892
Before being my son,
he's the CEO of Most Lab.

963
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:50,813
I believe he is qualified enough
to become CEO of Dosin Hightech.

964
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,816
I'll leave the final decision
to all of you.

965
01:01:10,041 --> 01:01:12,335
You won't be able to last long
without any shares.

966
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,213
Haven't you heard the news yet?

967
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:17,215
I sold off Most Lab

968
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,467
and secured Dosin Hightech's shares
with the money.

969
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:21,719
You bastard.

970
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:24,639
You're probably worried my father
might dump you and send you to prison.

971
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:27,433
He won't do that much
to his brother-in-law.

972
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,519
But Uncle,

973
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,650
I'm not like my father.

974
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,361
Seo Juntae,

975
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:41,989
you're finished.

976
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:09,142
I won't go down like this.

977
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:12,103
No way, Hwang Taeyong.

978
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,945
NA JUHEE

979
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,171
Na Juhee. It's me, Seo Juntae.

980
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:42,049
I'm calling to tell you something
that might intrigue you.

981
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:52,643
I didn't know

982
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,024
you'd make a way to come back
by securing shares on your own.

983
01:02:58,524 --> 01:02:59,484
Have you been

984
01:03:00,651 --> 01:03:01,819
testing me?

985
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:05,198
Of course not.

986
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,950
I tested my luck.

987
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,331
I'm so proud that
this is how you came back.

988
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,667
Do I not have to prove myself
to you anymore, then?

989
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,294
Taeyong,

990
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:21,214
you've more than proved yourself.

991
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:24,133
To me as well as everyone else.

992
01:03:30,932 --> 01:03:31,849
But Mr. Jang.

993
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,979
You fooled me until the end.

994
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,066
It's only right I fire you immediately,

995
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:43,194
but you don't work for me anymore.

996
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,280
You work for Taeyong now.

997
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:51,077
Good luck.

998
01:03:51,702 --> 01:03:52,745
Thank you, sir.

999
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:04,340
Are we back together after three years?

1000
01:04:05,174 --> 01:04:07,468
It sounds like you aren't so pleased.

1001
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:09,470
How did you know?

1002
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,974
What? Really?

1003
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,184
Well, it was a joke.

1004
01:04:18,145 --> 01:04:21,023
When you make such a joke,
please smile a little.

1005
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:24,151
You think?

1006
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,778
Hey, Hwang Taeyong!

1007
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:32,410
Is this why

1008
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:35,955
you sold Most Lab off without handling
employment succession issues?

1009
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:39,166
To release a false article
and secure your shares?

1010
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:41,627
I won't ask you to understand me.

1011
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,130
But you and I have
different situations and circumstances.

1012
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:47,425
Most Lab may have been a dream to you,

1013
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:50,553
but it was just a stepping stone to me.

1014
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:52,471
Goodness.

1015
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:56,475
A stepping stone
to succeeding Dosin Group?

1016
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:07,194
Still, this isn't right.

1017
01:05:07,820 --> 01:05:09,906
Your colleagues
who trusted and followed you.

1018
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,617
And me, who sincerely cared for you.

1019
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:17,204
You sold them off for your success.

1020
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:19,582
You damn jerk.

1021
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:54,533
I'm Writer Na Juhee
of Documentary Note, DSTV.

1022
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:57,328
CEO Hwang Taeyong,
could I have a moment to interview you?

1023
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:03,292
Munki, go without me. I'll go on my own.

1024
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,460
Yes, sir.

1025
01:06:13,803 --> 01:06:15,471
I'm certain Taeyong killed your father.

1026
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,808
Do you have proof?

1027
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:20,851
President Na's bloodstain

1028
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:23,312
was on Taeyong's jacket.

ANOTHER CHANCE, D-5

1031
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:45,334
THE SECRET BEHIND THE GOLDEN SPOON

1032
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,843
"A golden spoon
that can make you become rich.

1033
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:56,387
A weird old woman.

1034
01:06:58,389 --> 01:06:59,849
Eat three meals

1035
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:03,686
at the house of a friend your age
with the golden spoon,

1036
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,272
and your parents will be switched."

1037
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:12,194
"Lee Seungcheon, Hwang Taeyong?"

1038
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:15,156
"Swap your parents with your friend's."

1039
01:07:17,158 --> 01:07:18,492
What is all this about?

1040
01:07:49,940 --> 01:07:51,942
THE GOLDEN SPOON

1041
01:07:52,026 --> 01:07:53,778
Do you trust my father?

1042
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:54,862
I must defeat my father.

1043
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,407
If you could become rich,
would you swap your parents?

1044
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:00,576
I'll do the interview.

1045
01:08:00,659 --> 01:08:03,287
I still like you.

1046
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:05,289
If you don't want to regret it later,

1047
01:08:05,372 --> 01:08:06,874
you'd better stop this right now.

1048
01:08:07,666 --> 01:08:09,043
Hey.

1049
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:10,252
What's all that in there?

1050
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:13,214
Then kill Taeyong.
You said you'd do anything.

1051
01:08:13,297 --> 01:08:15,257
It was you, not me.

1052
01:08:15,341 --> 01:08:16,759
Mr. Smile.
