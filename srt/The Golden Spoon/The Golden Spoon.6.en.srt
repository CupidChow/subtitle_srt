1
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:34,784
Then, I guess you don't need
this golden spoon anymore.

2
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,537
No!

3
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,965
What have you done?

4
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:52,927
What's wrong?
I thought you didn't need it anymore.

5
00:00:53,011 --> 00:00:54,929
Who are you to throw away what's mine?

6
00:00:56,639 --> 00:00:59,893
So you were lying about wanting to live
as Lee Seungcheon.

7
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,353
You want to be Hwang Taeyong.

8
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,399
Don't worry. That was a fake.

9
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,443
-What?
-It's fake.

10
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:10,987
I have the real golden spoon.

11
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,701
How odd.
Is it a trend to carry one of these?

12
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:19,079
What do you mean?

13
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,456
Lee Seungcheon used
to have a golden spoon too.

14
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,594
Are you working here?

15
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:41,684
Oh Yeojin.

16
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,354
Why are you going this far?

17
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,898
Be Hwang Taeyong for me.

18
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,277
You'll be seeing the old woman soon.
I already know.

19
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:55,031
What would you get out of that?

20
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,324
I'm going to marry you.

21
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:59,744
Then Dosin Group will be mine.

22
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:01,788
You're insane.

23
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:05,917
What if I turn back into him
and choose someone else?

24
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,002
Then what?

25
00:02:09,003 --> 00:02:11,506
You'll have no choice but to choose me.

26
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:14,300
Think wisely, Lee Seungcheon.

27
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:16,886
Surely you don't want
to live in poverty all your life.

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,596
The clock is ticking.

29
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,691
Had I known you'd be coming over, Taeyong,

30
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,777
I would've called a chef over
and prepared a course meal.

31
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:34,571
-Lee!
-Yes, sir?

32
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,865
The meat is burnt!

33
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,033
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Jeez.

34
00:02:41,703 --> 00:02:42,745
Ms. Jin.

35
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,875
How could you make kimchi stew
on such a hot day?

36
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,751
This is terrible.

37
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,170
Should I call in a chef right now?

38
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,088
Jeez.

39
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,924
Hold on. What should I order?

40
00:02:57,051 --> 00:03:00,096
It's delicious. Mmm.

41
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,307
Right? It's good, isn't it?

42
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:04,267
She's an excellent cook.

43
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,352
-Lee, bring the meat!
-Yes, sir.

44
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:07,729
Hurry up.

45
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,106
Can you take this?

46
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,819
-By the way, sir.
-Yes?

47
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,821
What is it, Taeyong?

48
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,200
It seems like Seungcheon's parents

49
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,993
cook and clean for you.

50
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,745
They're getting paid, right?

51
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,999
What do you mean?

52
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:32,295
I'm asking if they're getting paid
for their hard work.

53
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:36,591
Are you power-tripping just because
you lent them 100 million won?

54
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,385
Of course not. That's not who I am.

55
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,763
Put it here.

56
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,767
I hope not.

57
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,268
Of course.

58
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,979
Serve it to them.

59
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,731
Take your time, Ms. Jin.

60
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,323
Gosh, who do we have here?

61
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,925
What business could
Juhee have with Oh Yeojin?

62
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,639
Taeyong.

63
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,808
Thank you for earlier.

64
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,851
No problem.

65
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:31,354
I heard you had something
to say to Seungcheon.

66
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,855
Should I relay your message?

67
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:34,941
Forget that.

68
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,821
Do you not care
what Lee Seungcheon thinks?

69
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,282
If I were him,
I'd hate it and feel embarrassed

70
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,200
to see my mom…

71
00:04:46,452 --> 00:04:48,496
work at my friend's house.

72
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:09,851
Why am I getting worked up?

73
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,646
Why are you here?

74
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,150
To brag about you and Lee Seungcheon
confessing your love for each other?

75
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,402
No. I came to warn you.

76
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,363
Warn me?

77
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,907
To stop having feelings
for Lee Seungcheon?

78
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:28,328
I can't believe you have the audacity
to say that to my face.

79
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,830
I don't care whom you like.

80
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:31,998
That's your choice.

81
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,042
But I must say this.

82
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:37,879
Treat Seungcheon with respect.

83
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:39,505
Don't go on a power trip with money.

84
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,174
Not to him or his family.

85
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,761
I came here to say this.

86
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:52,060
Who are you to act so arrogant?

87
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,317
You should worry
about your family instead.

88
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,944
I heard you're going broke.

89
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:20,129
I'm sorry, but you're not allowed here.

90
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:22,965
Move. Don't you know who I am?

91
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,759
Move already!

92
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:27,178
-Get out!
-Damn it!

93
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,347
-President Na.
-Stop them!

94
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,766
We've asked the banks

95
00:06:31,849 --> 00:06:34,477
to retrieve our investment in UBS TV.

96
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,772
Just move!

97
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,317
I'm sorry, sir.

98
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:45,071
President Na,
what brings you here unannounced?

99
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,281
Are you guys just going to stand there?

100
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,244
-Please help us, sir!
-Please help us, sir!

101
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,664
President Hwang, please help me.

102
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,713
Ever since the banks
and shareholders heard

103
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:05,299
that you were pulling your investment,
they've been panicking.

104
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:06,634
President Hwang.

105
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,721
If you pull out, I'm as good as dead.

106
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:14,392
You shouldn't have entrusted
your incompetent sons

107
00:07:14,475 --> 00:07:16,227
with your company.

108
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,983
You're right. It's all my fault.

109
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,988
So, President Hwang,
please help me this once.

110
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,656
I'm not asking you to help my sons.

111
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,076
But help me instead.

112
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:41,711
I've helped you enough.

113
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,713
UBS TV isn't even
a terrestrial television.

114
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,258
Whom do you have to thank
for helping you grow this big?

115
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:49,218
It's all thanks to Dosin Group.

116
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:54,474
I thought we were closer than this.
Will you really do this?

117
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,100
If you think we're that close,

118
00:07:58,227 --> 00:08:00,021
why don't you hand
your company over to me?

119
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,441
What did you say?

120
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:06,861
Was that your intention all along?

121
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,616
How could you do this to me?

122
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:15,703
Have you forgotten how I covered up
for Taeyong six years ago?

123
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,801
I was wondering when you'd mention that.

124
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,972
Sir, I believe that's all in the past.

125
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,557
Look.

126
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,938
I won't let you walk
all over me like this.

127
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,860
Then I'll understand
that our kids' engagement

128
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:50,488
is over.

129
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,086
You may begin.

130
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,838
UBS TV GLOBAL MEDIA TOWN FACES A CRISIS

131
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,840
UBS TV'S RECKLESS INVESTMENT
RESULTS IN MANAGEMENT CRISIS

132
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,515
Oh!

133
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,017
Hey, it's my daughter.

134
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:23,396
-Dad.
-Why are you still up?

135
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,107
Why did you drink so much?

136
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,402
Juhee. As you wished,

137
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:33,447
I called off your engagement
with Hwang Taeyong.

138
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,410
We've cut all ties with Dosin Group.

139
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:39,829
What do you say? Did I do well?

140
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:41,956
Dad.

141
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:44,750
You know what? To be honest,

142
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:49,046
I never wanted you to marry him.

143
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:51,090
Not even one bit.

144
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,050
I always felt bad

145
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,887
that I pushed ahead with the engagement

146
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,058
solely for money.

147
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:05,771
It's all for the best.
I feel liberated now.

148
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:08,858
Dad, what do you mean?

149
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,238
Juhee, don't you worry about a thing.

150
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:16,282
I will find

151
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,118
the right man

152
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,538
who will make my princess happy.

153
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:24,874
Okay?

154
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,297
Dad…

155
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,726
♪ Call me when you need me ♪

156
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,146
♪ I will come running whenever ♪

157
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,524
♪ No matter what
No matter what ♪

158
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,113
♪ No matter what ♪

159
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,074
You're still recovering.

160
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,701
You shouldn't drink this much.

161
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,206
Honey.

162
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:08,626
I had a drink

163
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:11,629
because I couldn't forget the smell

164
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,214
of that high-quality beef.

165
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,927
I was scolded
in front of Seungcheon's friends

166
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,055
like a slave.

167
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:25,476
I was so humiliated that I needed a drink.

168
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:32,441
But still, thank goodness

169
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,278
Seungcheon wasn't there.

170
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:44,954
Is that why you drank?

171
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,540
Because you were embarrassed and upset?

172
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,749
Yes.

173
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,502
Are you out of your mind?

174
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,463
Taeyong asked me

175
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,217
if I didn't feel sorry for Seungcheon

176
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,636
for living off of his friend's place.

177
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,639
I didn't know what to say.

178
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,683
And look at you.

179
00:12:08,102 --> 00:12:09,979
Don't you feel bad as his dad?

180
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,357
It's all my fault.

181
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,361
I'm to blame!

182
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,447
My family is struggling

183
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:22,324
because I can't make money.

184
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,744
I'm a lousy person! I know that!

185
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:26,620
It's all my fault.

186
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,834
What's with you?

187
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,128
Instead of sitting here and drinking,

188
00:12:34,211 --> 00:12:36,505
you should focus
on working hard to get out of here.

189
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,049
What are you doing?

190
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:13,209
Surely you don't want to
live in poverty all your life.

191
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,138
Yeojin, wait up.

192
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,058
-Let's have something tasty.
-Sure.

193
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:32,144
What should we have?

194
00:14:58,564 --> 00:14:59,690
Lee Seungcheon.

195
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:01,817
What are you doing right now?

196
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,449
Where's my golden spoon?

197
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,492
Ah. Your golden spoon?

198
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,202
You're looking for that?

199
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:15,122
You should have just asked me for it.

200
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,418
Are you ready to be Hwang Taeyong again?

201
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,920
Then say it.

202
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,506
Say that you want me, not Na Juhee.

203
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,468
Then I'll give it to you.

204
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,973
Don't be ridiculous.
Cut the nonsense and give it to me.

205
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,101
You're not that desperate yet, are you?

206
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,229
-You think I'll cave if you're this way?
-I can find it myself.

207
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,357
Hey.

208
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,193
What do you think you're doing?

209
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,281
-My golden spoon.
-Hey.

210
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,075
My golden spoon.

211
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:52,785
Let me go!

212
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,204
Are you insane?

213
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,045
What was that noise?

214
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,255
Yeojin! Yeojin!

215
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,511
What was that? Yeojin!

216
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:13,138
Dad! Can't you see that I'm changing?

217
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,765
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,102
I'm sorry, sweetie.

219
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,610
I'm sure I heard something shatter.

220
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,829
What is this? Did you get hurt?

221
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:38,622
Are you okay?

222
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,125
I must've been crazy.

223
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,962
You can have my golden spoon.

224
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,631
I don't want it anymore.

225
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,679
Maybe for now.

226
00:16:55,764 --> 00:16:56,682
Just wait and see.

227
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,269
You'll be coming back to me
for your golden spoon.

228
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:02,688
For sure.

229
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,300
What have I done?

230
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:44,104
DONGKYUNG

231
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,940
Hey, Dongkyung.

232
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:50,527
What?

233
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,196
Okay.

234
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,370
UBS TV'S RECKLESS INVESTMENT
RESULTS IN MANAGEMENT CRISIS

235
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,626
THE GENERAL SERVICE PROGRAM PROVIDER,
UBS TV, IS FACING A CRISIS

236
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:07,127
DUE TO THE FAMILY'S RECKLESS INVESTMENT

237
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,581
Seungcheon, when did you get here?

238
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:46,708
A while ago.

239
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:49,169
You should have told me.
Why were you just standing there?

240
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,296
I was thinking of what we could do today.

241
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:54,675
Should we eat?

242
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,135
Hmm…

243
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,219
No.

244
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,513
Then the library?

245
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,181
No.

246
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,641
Then what should we do?

247
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,480
Let's go on a date.

248
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,156
-I think they're singing over there.
-Let's go.

249
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,369
-Aren't they amazing?
-Yes.

250
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,858
That was so close.

251
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,824
Oh. Oh!

252
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,746
That's cool. I got it on my first try.

253
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,623
I even got it in one go.

254
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,605
I was baptized here.

255
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,402
I had my first Communion
and confession here as well.

256
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:45,369
Maybe that's why
I feel at peace whenever I come here.

257
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,919
You're going through
a rough time, aren't you?

258
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,549
I heard about your family.

259
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:04,471
So you've read the articles.

260
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:09,768
Still, my situation can't hold
a candle to yours.

261
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,688
Was I being too obvious?

262
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,273
Sorry.

263
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:19,361
It doesn't matter if you're rich or poor.

264
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,613
Losing money is hard.

265
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:27,494
Even more so if you lose

266
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:30,414
what you already had.

267
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:37,921
I'm so grateful to have you

268
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,090
by my side.

269
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,968
I'm nothing.

270
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:50,183
I'm not afraid at all because I have you.

271
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,734
Me neither.

272
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,695
I'm not afraid because of you.

273
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,450
To be honest, I'm afraid

274
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,744
that I'll abandon my parents again.

275
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:12,039
I'm terrified,

276
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,583
but I'll hang in there.

277
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,962
Move out this instant!

278
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:21,340
Sir, wait!

279
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,092
Wait. You can't do this to us.

280
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:27,763
Sir, please give us some time.

281
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,098
-Are you guys leeches?
-Please.

282
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:34,436
I don't want to hear it.
Pay me back in ten days and move out.

283
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,229
You'd better!

284
00:22:44,905 --> 00:22:45,906
Jeez!

285
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:48,200
Goodness.

286
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,286
That felt great.

287
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,790
I will miss Ms. Jin's cooking, though.

288
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,502
Didn't you want me to treat them well?
So why kick them out?

289
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,922
I told you.
I only have my eyes on Hwang Taeyong.

290
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,048
What do you mean?

291
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,926
Anyway, this is for the best.

292
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:09,054
You should never
keep the poor close to you.

293
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,681
Remember Jeong Nara
who lived there a long time ago?

294
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,518
She was a pathological liar
who always stole your stuff.

295
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:18,438
-The poor are all the same.
-So you kicked her out.

296
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,192
And she died.

297
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,070
I'm glad she did.

298
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:28,323
It's better to die than to live that way.

299
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:32,786
Also, I hated the fact
that she was close to you…

300
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,623
Yeojin! Yeojin!

301
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:41,294
Did you know?

302
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,214
Both Nara and I share
the same color of blood. Red.

303
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:48,385
She was a human just like us.

304
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:58,562
My poor daughter. She's too kind.

305
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:08,280
He has no idea his daughter is dead.

306
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,749
Calm down, Oh Yeojin.

307
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,751
You're not Jeong Nara anymore.

308
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:28,175
Wait.

309
00:24:29,759 --> 00:24:31,595
Where did I put Lee Seungcheon's
golden spoon?

310
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,347
We still have the 30-million-won deposit
from our former house.

311
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,224
We just need 70 million won more.

312
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:22,270
I worked like a dog,
but I'm still neck-deep in debt.

313
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:28,527
Mm. But once we pay off the debt,

314
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:30,111
where will we live?

315
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,701
Seriously, Oh Yeojin?

316
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:42,415
Your mom and I will take care of it.

317
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:45,168
Don't worry about it and eat up.

318
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,879
The food is getting cold. Eat up, okay?

319
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,758
Eat up. You too, Seungcheon.

320
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:05,188
Seungcheon, check your balance.
I sent you three million.

321
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,231
LEE SUNGAH
BALANCE: 3 MILLION

322
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:08,650
Yes, I got it. Thanks.

323
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:11,444
Seungcheon, I got that
through a credit loan.

324
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,363
You have to keep it safe.

325
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,782
Don't worry. You can trust me.

326
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,660
Sungah, hair wash over here.

327
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:20,203
Coming!

328
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:22,497
Seungcheon, let's talk again later.

329
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,339
Two million from me
and three million from Sungah.

330
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,427
It'll take 120 years
for this five million to reach 100 million

331
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,346
if I were to put it in a time deposit
with a three percent interest rate.

332
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:43,768
Thank you.

333
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,106
That'll be 130,000 won.

334
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:53,028
A savings bank with a 4.5 percent
interest rate will take 80 years.

335
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,281
If I could get a tax exemption,

336
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,033
it'll take 69 years.

337
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,162
They say you must be patient
to make money.

338
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:05,206
But I only have ten days.

339
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,709
That's all that I have.

00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:40,367
Father, is it true
that you called off our engagement?

350
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:44,621
-Yes, and?
-How could you?

351
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:48,249
The profit you'll gain
from maintaining your engagement

352
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,918
is around five trillion won.

353
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,254
However, the opportunity cost

354
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:54,881
including the investment loss

355
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,966
is around eight trillion won.

356
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,391
What do you think

357
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:08,478
is the most reasonable choice? Tell me.

358
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,605
You can't marry...

359
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,066
Juhee.

360
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,904
Is everything…

361
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:21,032
about money to you?

362
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:23,410
No matter what you say,

363
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:25,870
I won't give up on her.

364
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:29,124
She's my lifeline.

365
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:05,285
Look at that. That's the power of love.

366
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,120
Just look how hard he's trying.

367
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,248
Shh. Hyeondo might hear you.

368
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:13,835
This is your opportunity.

369
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,880
You should land yourself
a position in his company.

370
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,883
Do you think he'd like it

371
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:21,968
if I went empty-handed?

372
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,097
Wait and see.
I'm preparing a surprise for him.

373
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,067
You can't marry Juhee.

374
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:53,833
If I try hard to remember,
will the memories come back?

375
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,251
Not necessarily.

376
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,629
They may never return.

377
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,633
But on the other hand,
they could suddenly come flooding back.

378
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:03,927
For no specific reason.

379
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,353
Are you okay?

380
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,855
Young master!

381
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,449
Jeez, they shouldn't drive
such an expensive car so recklessly.

382
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:30,036
They should drive smoothly like I do.

383
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,329
Don't you agree, Ms. Jin?

384
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,752
Sir, where are we going?

385
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:42,632
You said you had
something special to tell me.

386
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,384
So I had to pick the right spot.

387
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,762
I thought we were going to a nearby café.

388
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,013
We're almost there.

389
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:56,938
HUSBAND

390
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,524
Is that Lee? Pick up.

391
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:03,820
Would it look weird
if he found out that I was with you?

392
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:13,037
The person you have called
cannot be reached…

393
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,038
Why won't she pick up?

394
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:16,124
DIALING…
GOD'S GIFT

395
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,592
Cheol, come here.

396
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,468
Okay.

397
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,849
Cheol, this won't do.

398
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,267
I've told you many times already.

399
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:37,061
The readers want something
stimulating, not this.

400
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:40,315
I couldn't make it any more provocative
since I have kids and all.

401
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,902
I guess you're not desperate enough.

402
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,404
Fine, just quit.

403
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:48,865
Keep leeching off of your wife.

404
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:51,993
Darn it. Am I a broken record?
I keep repeating the same thing--

405
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,913
Okay. I'll draw it again.

406
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,165
You'll pay me, right?

407
00:31:58,791 --> 00:31:59,626
Jeez.

408
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:02,170
JUNGJUN DINER

409
00:32:15,224 --> 00:32:16,351
Hello.

410
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,519
Mr. Lee, what brings you here?

411
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,688
-Hello. I don't see my wife.
-Hello.

412
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:22,899
What? She left early saying
she had something to do.

413
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,734
Did she not tell you?

414
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,235
-She left early?
-Yes.

415
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:30,239
I see. Thank you.

416
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:38,414
You want to pay me back later?

417
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:43,461
I can't allow that.
Credibility is crucial.

418
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:44,754
You should keep your promise.

419
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,005
I'm truly sorry.

420
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,635
Could you give us a bit more time?

421
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:54,389
Ms. Jin, why do you live like that?

422
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,724
Your husband is to blame.

423
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,686
He's putting you through all this
just because of 100 million won?

424
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,151
Just this once.

425
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:13,908
Please help us out
just this once, sir. Please?

426
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:18,329
Ms. Jin, you shouldn't look at me
with those doe eyes.

427
00:33:20,123 --> 00:33:22,542
Gosh, what should I do?

428
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,462
This is just terrible.

429
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,175
If you look at me like that,

430
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,178
you'll only sway me.

431
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:39,100
You know I have a soft heart, don't you?

432
00:33:40,476 --> 00:33:42,645
We'll leave after this winter.

433
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:45,940
-We'll pay you back before then.
-Shh.

434
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,194
Ms. Jin, look at the sea.

435
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,154
Isn't it stunning?

436
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:54,323
Let's forget about everything

437
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,451
for now. Okay?

438
00:33:56,534 --> 00:33:59,704
Forget about our kids and the past.

439
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:03,166
Let's just appreciate the waves.

440
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,001
No!

441
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:10,089
What the…

442
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,090
Ms. Jin?

443
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,258
Ms. Jin.

444
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:15,678
Ms. Jin! Ms. Jin!

445
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,097
Ms. Jin!

446
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,559
You can't just leave like that!

447
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:23,478
What are you doing?

448
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,480
Look at you.

449
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,566
You're pretty even when you're mad.

450
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,070
You need money, right?
I'll give it to you.

451
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,697
In return, spend the day with me.

452
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:36,657
-Mr. Oh.
-Yes?

453
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:38,117
Have you gone insane?

454
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,369
Yes! I've gone crazy!

455
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,498
I'm crazy for you! So stay with me!

456
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,958
What's wrong? Is 100 million not enough?

457
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,418
Then I'll give you more.

458
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:50,546
I'll get you an apartment as well.

459
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,508
So spend the day with me.

460
00:34:55,968 --> 00:34:57,470
You could offer me billions of won,

461
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:00,306
but I'd still hate to spend
a single second with you.

462
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,017
What? What did you say?

463
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:06,145
Ms. Jin! Stop right there!

464
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,397
Ms. Jin! Stop!

465
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,733
Hold up!

466
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,027
Stop! Hey!

467
00:35:34,882 --> 00:35:36,134
STOCK BALANCE/GAINS

468
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:37,802
-Internet café after this?
-Of course we're going.

469
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:38,970
No way!

470
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:42,640
A 120 percent earnings rate?

471
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,475
You're incredible.

472
00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,686
I still have a long way to go.

473
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,274
Seungcheon, isn't it too risky to invest
in items that suddenly rose in price?

474
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,443
Plus, you borrowed money
to buy more shares.

475
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,446
Hey, leverage is a must
if you want to make money.

476
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,990
He has no idea.

477
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:01,993
As if you know so much.

478
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:05,705
Hey, watch it.

479
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:07,415
Gosh, these are expensive.

480
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:09,917
How expensive?

481
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:12,795
Are those…

482
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,006
My mom bought them
so I'd get a scholarship.

483
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:17,008
Aren't they awesome?

484
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:19,260
Jaedon, let me wear them just once.

485
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,511
-No.
-Please.

486
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,638
Look. My mom got these for me.

487
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,557
Just once.

488
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,018
-They're limited edition.
-Just once.

489
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:30,021
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY THERE.
REST IN PEACE.

490
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:57,798
Jinseok, how have you been?

491
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,261
I had purposely forgotten about you.

492
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,181
I thought that would change my fate.

493
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:12,438
But Jinseok.

494
00:37:12,939 --> 00:37:14,899
I haven't told this to anyone.

495
00:37:19,695 --> 00:37:21,113
But I'm afraid of living.

496
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,201
I'm scared of poverty.

497
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,497
Goodness.

498
00:37:31,832 --> 00:37:32,833
What are you doing here?

499
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:36,963
I'm sorry. Please don't report me.

500
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,049
Please. Please.

501
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,134
You can't live here.

502
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,012
-Hey.
-What are you doing?

503
00:37:45,596 --> 00:37:49,433
Can you give me just 10,000 won?

504
00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:57,984
Here.

505
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,195
Hey.

506
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:08,160
Could you give me just one more?

507
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,080
Please?

508
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:23,259
I guess you won't be rich either.

509
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,887
You can't save up any money
if you waste it like this.

510
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:30,516
You'll be spending more than you make.

511
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,393
So how will you save any?

512
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,771
How rude of you
when I just wanted to help.

513
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:37,982
Give that back.

514
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,990
He's so cheap. It was only 10,000 won.

515
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,290
I'll buy some instant noodles with this.

516
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,503
I should hurry and find the old woman.

517
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,009
No.

518
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,554
I should find my golden spoon first.

519
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:11,724
What a weird lady.

520
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,612
This is so infuriating.

521
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,907
Who are you to look down on me?

522
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,826
That's enough.
I have nothing more to say to you.

523
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,081
Hey, you flirted with me first.

524
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,041
You wanted to have some coffee.

525
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,210
And I said I'd give you 100 million won!

526
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:43,172
Your body isn't worth that much anyway.

527
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:47,426
Sir, you'll get punished for saying that.

528
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,888
Punished, my foot.

529
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,474
I don't want to sleep with you anymore
even if you beg me to.

530
00:39:54,350 --> 00:39:55,643
The train has left the station.

531
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,520
You're just worthless garbage.

532
00:39:58,771 --> 00:39:59,688
That bastard.

533
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,527
-Let me go. He'll pay for this.
-Hey…

534
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,945
Do you have money?

535
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,197
Hit him if you can compensate him.

536
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,826
Think of your mom.

537
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,078
It's better for her
if you turn a blind eye.

538
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:17,873
How impudent of you.

539
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,292
You're all worthless.

540
00:40:20,376 --> 00:40:21,335
-You--
-Dad.

541
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,464
Hi, sweetie. Let's go home.

542
00:40:25,548 --> 00:40:27,133
Get in.

543
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:12,386
Honey.

544
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,807
I heard you left work early today.

545
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:18,058
Is something wrong?

546
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,853
No, I just met with a friend.

547
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,354
A friend?

548
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,443
To borrow money?

549
00:41:28,777 --> 00:41:29,737
I'm sorry.

550
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,740
You haven't had dinner yet, right?
I'll be quick.

551
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,782
Honey.

552
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,953
I landed a gig today.

553
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:41,540
They'll pay me next week,
but it's not much.

554
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,501
Still, it's something.

555
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,670
I'm so happy for you.
I'll get dinner ready.

556
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,763
Goodness.

557
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:04,313
TICKET
GANGNEUNG TO SEOUL

558
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,397
Gangneung?

559
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,734
Does she have a friend who lives there?

560
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,753
Won't you regret it?

561
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,047
I do regret it.

562
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,467
A ton.

563
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,889
I can't believe all I took
from that house was a fake watch.

564
00:42:44,478 --> 00:42:46,188
If I ever become Hwang Taeyong again,

565
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:49,066
I won't make the same mistake.

566
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:55,030
If I ever become

567
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,825
Hwang Taeyong again--

568
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,494
If you ever become Hwang Taeyong again?

569
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:09,670
Granny.

570
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:13,007
You must want to use
the golden spoon again.

571
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,229
What am I thinking?

572
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:36,113
School shooting…

573
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:38,198
2006 ST. JEROME SCHOOL SHOOTING

574
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,867
MASS SHOOTING
2006 US HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT

575
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:46,957
2006 US SHOOTING

576
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:56,008
This is strange.

577
00:43:56,091 --> 00:43:57,593
I can't find any articles

578
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,554
on that incident from six years ago.

579
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:04,475
Do you mean the incident in the US?

580
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,392
Yes.

581
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:07,519
But why all of a sudden…

582
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:13,233
A bit of my memory
from that incident has come back.

583
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,152
But something's off.

584
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,780
I want to check something.

585
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,532
I'm sure President Hwang erased
all related articles.

586
00:44:21,283 --> 00:44:24,495
But there is one person
who might still have them.

587
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:05,679
Are you going to take longer?

588
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,228
Mr. Jang? What are you doing there?

589
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:16,607
Well…

590
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,109
I had something to tell you.

591
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,235
Me?

592
00:46:21,570 --> 00:46:23,572
I don't think
the young master is doing well.

593
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:27,993
I told him to take the day off,
but he's not listening to me.

594
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,417
I see. I'll talk to him later.

595
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:43,258
Let me open the door for you, ma'am.

596
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,181
It says that he committed suicide.

597
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,058
But I remember him getting shot.

598
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:55,145
Then who shot him?

599
00:46:56,438 --> 00:46:57,648
The police?

600
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:16,375
Mr. Jang, didn't you hear something?

601
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,461
Pardon? I didn't hear anything, ma'am.

602
00:48:25,485 --> 00:48:27,446
MS. GONG

603
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:34,244
Ms. Gong, I found my phone.

604
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,371
I'm coming down now.

For sure.

642

Goodness. Excuse me!

648
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,160
Dad, just throw it away!
Don't pick that up!

649
00:53:25,243 --> 00:53:26,203
Why not?

650
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:30,790
Look. It's still usable.

651
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,879
I'll stay with a coworker.

652
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,466
And Seungcheon will be staying
at Dongkyung's.

653
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:41,927
What about you guys? Where will you stay?

654
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,012
I can sleep at the diner.

655
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:46,514
And your dad will go to your great-aunt's.

656
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:48,183
Wouldn't she be delighted.

657

You're nothing but a loan shark!
I hope you go broke!

659
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,738
I hope you go broke!

660
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:04,866
What's so funny?

661
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,203
Sungah, hang in there.

662
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,413
We'll live together again soon enough.

663
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:17,629
Where in the world is Seungcheon?

664
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,720
I got a new car.

665
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,931
Yeojin, you should get one too.

666
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,557
I came here in my new car.

667
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,977
Really? You got a new car?

668
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:43,113
Oh Yeojin, we need to talk.

669
00:54:45,031 --> 00:54:47,158
Who is he? He's handsome.

670
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,828
-Boyfriend?
-Lucky you.

671
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,289
Lee Seungcheon.

672
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:55,292
They're asking me who you are.
What should I say?

673
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:58,128
I couldn't care less.
I'm here for my golden spoon.

674
00:54:58,211 --> 00:55:01,047
It must be urgent,
seeing how you came all the way here.

675
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,217
Right. You'll be seeing
the old woman tomorrow.

676
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,635
Oh Yeojin!

677
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:08,263
Give it back.

678
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:11,558
Where is my golden spoon?

679
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,519
Are you that desperate?

680
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:18,064
Then kneel.

681
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,663
TRANSFER AND TAKEOVER OF SHARES AGREEMENT
COMPANY NAME: YUBAN INDUSTRIES

682
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,540
TRANSFERER: NA JUHEE

683
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:37,167
Juhee grew up into a kindhearted girl.

684
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:40,712
Siblings from rich families
rarely transfer their shares.

685
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,843
Is President Hwang aware of this?

686
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,347
He shouldn't be. This is a surprise.

687
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:51,306
Look at that.

688
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:55,435
A Harvard graduate sure knows
how to prepare a surprise.

689
00:55:56,478 --> 00:56:01,107
By the way, where will you get the money
without his help?

690
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,902
That's none of your concern.

691
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,781
Is President Na aware of this transaction?

692
00:56:09,491 --> 00:56:12,118
But then again,
that's none of my business.

693
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,297
JT LIVIT EQUITY

694
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,133
Are you out of your mind?

695
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,386
How dare you do that?

696
00:56:29,469 --> 00:56:31,763
What's all this?
I guess they'll really hit rock bottom.

697
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:33,973
-What should we do?
-You can clock out now.

698
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,437
Even still,

699
00:56:39,521 --> 00:56:41,689
how could you hand over all your shares?

700
00:56:43,233 --> 00:56:47,278
Can't you see that your brothers just want
to get out of this on their own?

701
00:56:47,862 --> 00:56:49,447
I know that.

702
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,410
But I heard
you could be arrested for this.

703
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:54,869
You're not young either.

704
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,622
And money isn't all that important.

705
00:56:57,705 --> 00:56:59,207
Are you kidding me?

706
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:02,210
Do you think
you'll be of any value without money?

707
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,171
How many times must I tell you
that you'd be nothing

708
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:07,507
if it wasn't for your money?

709
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:10,468
Dad, can you please stop

710
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,262
obsessing over money?

711
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:15,306
Do you still not get it
even after Mom passed away?

712
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:18,852
Did she need money? No.

713
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:21,729
It was all for you.

714
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,815
I did it all for you.

715
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,733
Don't be absurd.

716
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:28,736
I told you that what I needed
was you, not money.

717
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:32,073
You should be honest with yourself.

718
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:36,119
You hate losing the title of president
more than not being my dad.

719
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:37,203
Am I wrong?

720
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,958
-Juhee.
-Miss Juhee.

721
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,501
Juhee!

722
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,695
After the incident,

723
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:13,281
Reporter Lee Chulseung
started working for UBS TV.

724
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,075
He worked closely with President Na.

725
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,911
But he's missing as of now.

726
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:19,704
There's something…

727
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,625
I don't know.

728
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:49,734
Honey.

729
00:58:50,485 --> 00:58:52,737
Don't worry about Juhee.

730
00:58:53,238 --> 00:58:55,240
I'll protect her no matter what.

731
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:10,630
BIBLE

732
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,391
Hwang Hyeondo.

733
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:25,728
I won't go down alone.

734
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:31,484
Sir.

735
00:59:33,152 --> 00:59:35,780
It's late. Why are you still working?

736
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:37,490
You have a guest.

737
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:38,908
A guest?

738
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,411
Come in.

739
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,837
-You should clock out.
-Yes, sir.

740
00:59:56,551 --> 00:59:57,802
What brings you here?

741
00:59:59,053 --> 01:00:02,974
I'd like to ask you something.

742
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:18,448
BOOK OF SOLUTIONS

743
01:00:18,698 --> 01:00:21,367
YOU'RE NOT IN NEED OF ANY ADVICE

744
01:00:37,842 --> 01:00:39,093
Juhee.

745
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,601
You're right.

746
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:50,688
Your father asked me to cover up
the incident, and so I did.

747
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,233
Is that the answer you were looking for?

748
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,989
I heard the suspect, Jimmy,

749
01:01:01,616 --> 01:01:03,534
committed suicide
at the scene of the crime.

750
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:08,206
But I definitely remember him
getting shot by someone.

751
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:16,130
Do you finally remember that incident?

752
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:19,550
Just a bit.

753
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,970
But I'd like to ask you
about Reporter Lee Chulseung.

754
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,474
I heard he worked closely with you,
but he's missing now.

755
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,895
But I'm sure you already know that.

756
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,400
There's something else that only you know,

757
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:37,860
isn't there?

758
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:45,785
I may know many things about that case,

759
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:49,747
but not as much as your father does.

760
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:53,960
Plus, seeing how you're here,

761
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:57,004
you must finally remember everything.

762
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:59,549
What do you mean?

763
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,426
Do you really not get it?

764
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:02,885
Those kids,

765
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,346
you killed them.

766
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,025
Taeyong! Taeyong!

767
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:19,694
Let go.

768
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:23,990
-Taeyong, hear me out!
-I said let go!

769
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:27,034
Do you think I'd believe your lies?

770
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:29,245
I know you despise my father!

771
01:02:30,037 --> 01:02:32,373
But still, how could you lie
and say that I'm a murderer?

772
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:37,003
Lying is your father's specialty,
not mine.

773
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,964
Do you want to know something else?

774
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,325
What did you pray about?

775
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:10,703
Just this and that.

776
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,623
Obvious things.

777
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,627
Does God really listen to our prayers?

778
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:19,545
I'm not sure.

779
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,923
But my dad does it

780
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,343
because there's nothing
he'd lose from doing it.

781
01:03:29,013 --> 01:03:32,308
What about you?
What do you want to pray about?

782
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,649
I hope for my parents to be healthy

783
01:03:41,150 --> 01:03:43,778
and my sister to become a hair designer.

784
01:03:46,906 --> 01:03:48,157
I also hope

785
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:51,744
we'll have a lot of money.

786
01:03:54,121 --> 01:03:56,374
And I also hope
your family will sort things out.

787
01:03:57,959 --> 01:04:01,379
Seungcheon, why are you so kindhearted?

788
01:04:02,797 --> 01:04:05,091
You should pray for yourself too.

789
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:07,176
You're too kind.

790
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:11,472
You have no idea. I'm not kind.

791
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:16,018
I'm actually a really bad person.

792
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,104
More than you can imagine.

793
01:04:19,438 --> 01:04:21,649
Hey, who would believe that?

794
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:23,359
No, Juhee. I'm…

795
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:30,074
I'm…

796
01:04:32,285 --> 01:04:36,122
This is the confession
I want to make to you.

797
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:42,545
Just like Judas who sold Jesus
for 30 pieces of silver,

798
01:04:43,462 --> 01:04:47,466
I'm going to abandon
my parents once again.

799
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,472
Although I decided to give up
my name and my family,

800
01:04:55,391 --> 01:04:57,602
there was one thing
I didn't want to let go of.

801
01:04:58,561 --> 01:04:59,604
It was you.

802
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:19,040
Seungcheon, you should pray too.

803
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,250
I already did.

804
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:31,510
I prayed that
you'd still recognize and like me…

805
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:36,015
even if I appeared in front of you…

806
01:05:38,976 --> 01:05:40,603
as a completely different person.

807
01:05:43,147 --> 01:05:44,690
That's a given.

808
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,401
Why would I not recognize you?

809
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,780
And if that's your wish,

810
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:53,282
then your wish has already come true.

811
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:02,643
I'm sorry, Juhee.

812
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:09,358
But I must become

813
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:12,403
Hwang Taeyong now.

814
01:07:32,006 --> 01:07:33,090
Seungcheon did look

815
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:37,762
a bit anxious today.

816
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:59,742
What's going on? Is it a power outage?

817
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:13,589
Dad.

818
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,061
It's so dark.

819
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,899
Dad, are you here?

820
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:04,390
Dad.

821
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:05,975
Dad!

822
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,477
Dad!

823
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,021
Ms. Kim!

824
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:13,524
Dad.

825
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:15,067
Dad!

826
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:21,240
No!

827
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:38,465
Father?

828
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:53,981
Yes.

829
01:09:55,399 --> 01:09:56,817
You must have had a nightmare.

830
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:58,402
I did.

831
01:09:59,778 --> 01:10:02,198
I dreamed that
President Na had passed away,

832
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,034
and Juhee was bawling. It was horrendous.

833
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:09,288
I'm truly glad that it was a dream.

834
01:10:17,338 --> 01:10:19,048
What an odd dream.

835
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,092
He did pass away yesterday.

836
01:10:25,095 --> 01:10:26,847
What do you mean? Out of the blue?

837
01:10:27,431 --> 01:10:30,017
I don't know the details yet.

838
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:35,481
He was fine when I saw him yesterday.

839
01:10:52,331 --> 01:10:55,125
Those kids, you killed them.

840
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:02,549
Father.

841
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:06,095
I can't remember clearly.

842
01:11:07,554 --> 01:11:10,516
Did I kill him?

843
01:11:12,685 --> 01:11:15,729
Did I murder President Na?

844
01:11:17,231 --> 01:11:18,232
What are you on about?

845
01:11:18,857 --> 01:11:20,401
Are you still not sober?

846
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:24,363
How's that possible when you were
carried home passed out drunk?

847
01:11:31,036 --> 01:11:32,746
Remember this.

848
01:11:32,830 --> 01:11:36,208
You never met with President Na.

849
01:11:37,251 --> 01:11:38,252
Never.

850
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:51,890
Rest up.

851
01:12:16,832 --> 01:12:18,542
Young master!

852
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:20,419
Where are you going?

853
01:12:21,462 --> 01:12:22,546
Young master!

854
01:12:47,738 --> 01:12:48,655
Did…

855
01:12:49,823 --> 01:12:50,991
Did I do it?

856
01:12:58,123 --> 01:13:01,126
Did I really kill him?

857
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:10,928
DO NOT ENTER
UNDER INVESTIGATION

858
01:13:30,364 --> 01:13:32,366
Hey! Do you want to die?

859
01:13:36,662 --> 01:13:39,790
Are you crazy? What on earth
do you think you're doing?

860
01:13:39,873 --> 01:13:41,917
Move! Unless you want to die too.

861
01:13:43,961 --> 01:13:47,423
Don't be ridiculous.
Do you think I'd let you die?

862
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,883
Shut up! What's it to you?

863
01:13:49,967 --> 01:13:51,844
I'm going to die, I'll kill myself!

864
01:14:02,354 --> 01:14:03,897
Get a grip, Hwang Taeyong.

865
01:14:04,523 --> 01:14:06,608
You can't die right now.

866
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:08,152
You cannot.

867
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:13,198
Hey!

868
01:14:13,991 --> 01:14:15,033
Get him!

869
01:14:17,494 --> 01:14:18,954
Hey, you!

870
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:21,707
Hey!

871
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:25,085
Where did the young master go
this early in the morning?

872
01:14:25,627 --> 01:14:27,713
I'm not sure either.

873
01:14:28,839 --> 01:14:30,883
-Stop right there!
-Get him!

874
01:14:30,966 --> 01:14:33,552
-Goodness. What's with that?
-Come on, get him!

875
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,053
-Get him!
-Come here!

876
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:36,930
You can't go in there!

877
01:14:37,264 --> 01:14:39,433
-Stop!
-Hold up!

878
01:14:39,516 --> 01:14:41,894
-Stop right there! Hey, kid!
-Lee Seungcheon.

879
01:15:01,205 --> 01:15:02,331
What are you doing?

880
01:15:03,874 --> 01:15:06,376
Lee Seungcheon! Lee Seungcheon!

881
01:15:27,731 --> 01:15:28,899
Young master.

882
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:34,738
The young master is leaving.

883
01:16:56,486 --> 01:16:58,155
Congratulations on your return
to Hwang Taeyong.

884
01:16:58,238 --> 01:16:59,615
Did you not see anything

885
01:16:59,698 --> 01:17:01,158
on the day my dad died?

886
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:03,910
Why did you want to kill yourself,
Hwang Taeyong?

887
01:17:04,244 --> 01:17:06,121
You met and killed President Na.

888
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:09,166
-Is it a sin to not have money?
-It is!

889
01:17:09,791 --> 01:17:11,501
It's the most miserable sin of them all!

890
01:17:12,377 --> 01:17:13,670
He's not the Lee Seungcheon
you knew and liked.

891
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:15,047
He's not the same guy.

892
01:17:15,130 --> 01:17:17,090
-Hwang Taeyong.
-I'm Lee Seungcheon.

893
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:18,550
So it was you.

894
01:17:18,634 --> 01:17:19,968
How could you…
