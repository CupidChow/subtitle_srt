THE GOLDEN SPOON

2
00:00:42,542 --> 00:00:44,377
-Honey.
-Dad.

3
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,421
-Honey, Cheol!
-Dad.

4
00:00:46,504 --> 00:00:48,298
-Dad.
-Honey.

5
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,092
-Cheol. Honey.
-Dad!

6
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,470
Cheol!

7
00:00:58,391 --> 00:00:59,267
Taeyong.

8
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,271
Taeyong.

9
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,982
How injured is my husband?

10
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,402
It's not serious, is it? He's okay, right?

11
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,991
What is this?

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,495
Taeyong, why aren't you saying anything?

13
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,955
Answer me!

14
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,750
Taeyong, is my husband okay?

15
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,461
Taeyong.

16
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:29,255
Doctor.

17
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,008
My husband is okay, right?

18
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:35,178
Doctor, where is my husband?

19
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:36,596
Mom…

20
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:38,807
Dad…

21
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:43,269
Patient Lee Cheol passed away at 8:50 p.m.

22
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:48,024
Dad! Dad!

23
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,443
Mom! Mom!

24
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:51,611
Honey…

25
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:52,946
Honey!

26
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:55,990
Dad…

27
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,410
No…

28
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:01,079
No!

29
00:02:01,788 --> 00:02:04,415
It can't be true. It just can't…

30
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,377
Honey, it's me.

31
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,504
Cheol.

32
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,298
Dad.

33
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,842
Say something.

34
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,136
Why aren't you saying anything?

35
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,346
Why? Honey.

36
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,890
No…

37
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,892
No!

38
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,816
Honey.

39
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:33,736
Dad.

40
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,074
Who did this?

41
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:40,785
Tell me, you bastard!
You must know who did it!

42
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,745
Who was it?

43
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:45,039
Who did that to my dad?

44
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,833
Seo Juntae.

45
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:50,837
-What?
-Seo Juntae.

46
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,649
He just passed away at the hospital.

47
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,693
-What about Juntae?
-We're still looking for him.

48
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,987
You must find him before the police do.

49
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,988
Yes, sir.

50
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,990
-What about my wife?
-Well,

51
00:03:19,073 --> 00:03:21,201
she's going to hold
the house concert as planned.

52
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,162
-What time?
-It begins in an hour.

53
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,259
EPISODE 15

54
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,656
BASED ON THE NAVER WEBTOON
THE GOLDEN SPOON BY HD3

55
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,478
Juntae, listen to me.

56
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,438
I'm going to go perform now.

57
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,732
If I suddenly cancel it,
people will wonder.

58
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,110
Get changed into these clothes first.

59
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:40,446
You're the safest here,
so don't leave this room, okay?

60
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:42,991
Thank you, Youngshin.

61
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,077
But why aren't you asking me anything?

62
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,413
Something must have come up.

63
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,708
Hyeondo says that you've killed people,

64
00:04:52,417 --> 00:04:53,710
but I don't believe it.

65
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,795
You'd never kill anyone.

66
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,255
Right, Youngshin.

67
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,757
Don't ever believe Hyeondo.

68
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:05,138
It's his fault that I ended up like this.

69
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,143
Young master, are you okay?

70
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:12,186
What's all that blood?

71
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:18,192
Young master.

72
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,409
Young master.

73
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,011
I'm going to kill Hwang Hyeondo.

74
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,861
Seo Juntae!

75
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:03,821
Why did you kill my dad?

76
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,656
Why? Why?

77
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,035
What are you saying, you crazy bastard?

78
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:27,762
Get off my son.

79
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,809
Father, let's report him to the police.

80
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,310
-I'll make the call.
-Take him.

81
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,729
What?

82
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:40,108
Father, Seo Juntae is a murderer!
You know that!

83
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,443
Father! Father!

84
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,613
Why don't we have a chat?

85
00:06:46,864 --> 00:06:48,741
Let go of me!

86
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:52,245
Father! Father!

87
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,621
Let go!

88
00:06:57,875 --> 00:06:58,709
Open up.

89
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,336
Open the door right now!

90
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,797
That bastard Seo Juntae must be arrested.

91
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,591
Open the door!

92
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,428
Seo Juntae is the culprit. He did it!

93
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:09,804
We're looking into it.

94
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:11,556
We have to check the CCTV camera footage

95
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:15,226
-and collect evidence.
-What is this?

96
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,311
Were you never going to stop him?

97
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,689
Because he's
Hwang Hyeondo's brother-in-law?

98
00:07:19,772 --> 00:07:21,858
Maybe you were never planning
on catching him!

99
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,859
Calm down.

100
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,611
Do you remember this gun?

101
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:31,242
I had prepared this for you.

102
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,454
I didn't know

103
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,000
I would use this again

104
00:07:40,084 --> 00:07:41,085
to aim at you.

105
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:43,337
You've always been like this.

106
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:45,923
You lie, deceive,

107
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,468
and betray others.

108
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,472
Shoot me if you want.

109
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,224
Shoot you?

110
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,144
Juntae.

111
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,941
I'm not going to shoot you.

112
00:08:10,072 --> 00:08:11,282
You'll cover it up

113
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:15,119
so the stock price won't fall
and the group won't lose its reputation?

114
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:20,333
It's a pity that
Lee Seungcheon's father had to die,

115
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:22,418
but it's a good thing.

116
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,670
You did well.

117
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:28,424
He was going to keep getting in my way.

118
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:31,052
Juntae.

119
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,305
Let's take our time to think about

120
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,058
how we are going to

121
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,228
handle this situation.

122
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:45,650
I have a nice idea.

123
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,196
Thank you so much, Hyeondo.

124
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:53,491
But…

125
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,249
My sister once told me

126
00:09:01,332 --> 00:09:03,584
that she'd never believe you.

127
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:06,963
I should have listened to her sooner.

128
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,675
Why did I believe you like a fool?

129
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,929
Because I was fond of you.

130
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,975
When others said that I resembled you,

131
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:20,893
I felt

132
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:24,480
good.

133
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,735
But you ruined my life!

134
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,991
If you want to shoot me,

135
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,953
now is your only chance.

136
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,079
But,

137
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,331
the one who ruined your life wasn't me,

138
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:45,167
but your mom.

139
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:46,961
My mom?

140
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:48,754
Shall I tell you the truth?

141
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,674
Your real mother

142
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,177
is Seo Youngshin,

143
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,639
your older sister.

144
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:08,274
Now, the choice is up to you.

145
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,816
Juntae?

146
00:10:53,069 --> 00:10:54,195
Juntae left

147
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,489
with a gun just now.

148
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:57,573
Call in the security team.

149
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,493
Stop him before things get serious.

150
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,040
You were

151
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:07,917
my mom?

152
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,684
Juntae, what are you talking about?

153
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,774
My brother is a little sick.

154
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,609
So he was hospitalized.

155
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,487
Juntae, you should be
at the hospital, not here.

156
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:39,031
I'll take you back to the hospital.

157
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,074
Are you my mom?

158
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,368
Answer me!

159
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:50,334
Pull yourself together.
I'm your older sister!

160
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,294
Mom passed away a long time ago.

161
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,756
The medication
doesn't seem to work at all.

162
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,718
I'm sick and tired
of your rants about Mom.

163
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:01,262
You're sick of it?

164
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:18,946
Juntae, you shouldn't do this.

165
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,157
Put the gun down. I'm sorry.

166
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,034
I'll tell you everything.

167
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,995
Let's talk it out.
You believe me, don't you?

168
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,248
No, I don't believe you anymore.

169
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,087
Juntae.

170
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,589
Ta-da!

171
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,259
You look the best
when you smile like this.

172
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:44,013
Study hard in the States,

173
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,557
and I'll make sure to visit you soon.

174
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,892
You'll come, right?

175
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:48,934
Of course.

176
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,862
Let me ask you one last time.

177
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,325
Are you my mom?

178
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,119
Just answer that.

179
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:10,498
Juntae, that is not important right now.

180
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,418
I'm always by your side.

181
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,505
No matter what happens,
I'll protect you to the end.

182
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:18,547
I won't leave you.

183
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:21,967
Juntae, please put this down.

184
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:25,596
You won't admit it until the end.

185
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,266
If you were really my sister,

186
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:31,268
you'd tell me you were my mom

187
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,938
whether it was a lie or not.

188
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,941
-Juntae.
-Mom.

189
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,070
I hope you live in hell.

190
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,865
Juntae! No!

191
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,285
Young master!

192
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,721
LEE CHEOL

193
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:27,116
Goodness.

194
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,577
How could something like this happen?

195
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,913
I can't believe this happened
to our kind-hearted man…

196
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,916
This is just unbelievable.

197
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,418
Goodness, Cheol.

198
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,130
Let me do what I can to help.

199
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,048
Goodness.

200
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:44,091
Mom.

201
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,760
Juhee is here.

202
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,770
I'm here with Taeyong.

203
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:07,114
How dare you come here?

204
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:10,534
My dad died because of you!
How dare you come here?

205
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,869
Just leave.

206
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:13,621
Get out of here!

207
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,705
Go!

208
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,917
Sungah.

209
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,586
It's all right.

210
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,341
Taeyong, come in.

211
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,176
Pay your respects.

212
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,345
-Mom.
-It's okay.

213
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,891
Get off!

214
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,421
I know. It's not Taeyong's fault.

215
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:06,674
He probably

216
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,468
understands you.

217
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,209
Mr. Lee.

218
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,379
Hey, Seung… Taeyong.

219
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,686
-Father, what's going--
-Don't call me that!

220
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,063
Don't you dare come back here again.

221
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,525
Do you know what this is?

222
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,487
He wrote this poem
in third grade, and it's called…

223
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,032
"Free." That's the title.

224
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,704
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

225
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,003
I don't care what your name is.

226
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:29,673
I will always love you.
Because you're my son.

227
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,209
It's not my fault.

228
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,172
I only let Mr. Lee know the truth.

229
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,802
It's not my fault.

230
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:30,943
SUCCESS AFTER SUCCESS

231
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,695
CLOSED FOR THE TIME BEING
DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

232
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,279
Dad used it to draw webtoons.

233
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,364
Are you going to sell it?

234
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:19,366
No, I'm going to keep it.

235
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,544
Hmm?

236
00:19:31,086 --> 00:19:32,129
What is this?

237
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,132
Huh?

238
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,551
I think Dad used my golden spoon.

239
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:40,179
He knew who I was.

240
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:41,972
I didn't know Dad had something like this.

241
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,226
Give it to me.
It belongs to Hwang Taeyong.

242
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,275
He should have bought some clothes.

243
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:39,446
Like you said, let's go out
and enjoy the change of seasons.

244
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,407
And with Sungah and Seungcheon…

245
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,744
Let's be happy together.

246
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:53,293
We never got to go and enjoy
the colored leaves in autumn.

247
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:57,422
It'll soon

248
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,634
be autumn.

249
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,806
You shouldn't have made a promise
you couldn't keep.

250
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,689
How could you leave us like this?

251
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,280
Honey…

252
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:28,870
Honey…

253
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,310
What have I done?

254
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:53,937
At first,

255
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,190
I just wanted to become rich.

256
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,194
I wanted to become rich

257
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:05,574
and buy a house for my parents.

258
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:09,661
I just wanted to live a life

259
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,208
without having to worry about
making a living.

260
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,589
Where did it start to go wrong?

261
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:10,430
One of your employees
gave us your condolence money.

262
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:15,352
Are you trying to return the money?

263
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,145
Is that why you came?

264
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,565
What's so great about your money

265
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:22,859
that I would bother to return it?

266
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:27,948
I appreciate your condolences.

267
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,872
I came here to see the pencils

268
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:39,000
my husband wanted to have.

269
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,046
There it is.

270
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,498
My husband was the kind of person

271
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:21,376
who thought he was
the richest in the world

272
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:28,300
with his favorite pencil
and a glass of soju.

273
00:24:36,349 --> 00:24:37,851
But you know what?

274
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,895
You look poor.

275
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:45,525
You're surrounded
by all this valuable and expensive stuff,

276
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,444
but strangely, you look so poor.

277
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:53,074
I see there are various ways
to express your inferiority complex.

278
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,203
I wonder what others will think
if they hear this.

279
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,079
I don't care about what others think.

280
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,956
What matters is what you think.

281
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,292
You probably think I'm right.

282
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:08,715
You've never been satisfied
with what you had.

283
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:19,309
This pencil suits a poor man like you.

284
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:27,984
I'd better pay for this pencil, right?

285
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:41,498
CASHIER'S CHECK

286
00:26:41,558 --> 00:26:43,685
I think Dad used my golden spoon.

287
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,811
He knew who I was.

288
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:46,605
Give it to me.
It belongs to Hwang Taeyong.

289
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,651
HWANG TAEYONG

290
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:03,163
HWANG TAEYONG

291
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,000
Hello?

292
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,971
Why did you want to see me here?

293
00:27:21,389 --> 00:27:23,141
I made up my mind here

294
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,352
to become rich.

295
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,523
It's where I promised Jinseok
that I'd make it big.

296
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,113
I have something for you.

297
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,286
It's yours.

298
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:50,543
I want to sincerely
apologize to you, Taeyong.

299
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,589
Because of my greed, I stole your life

300
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:59,511
and even made Dad pass away.

301
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,850
Only after he passed away,

302
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:08,645
did I realize how wrong I was.

303
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,856
Do you regret it?

304
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,403
Do you want to be Lee Seungcheon again?

305
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:20,657
I have no right to say that.

306
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,496
I'll meet the golden spoon granny
and make the final choice soon.

307
00:28:29,958 --> 00:28:32,377
Tell me if you want to go back
to being Hwang Taeyong.

308
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,962
I mean it.

309
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:49,227
Here, it's your golden spoon.

310
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:53,273
I found it among Dad's things.

311
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:04,075
Like I told you before,
I'll stay as Lee Seungcheon.

312
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:08,121
That doesn't mean
I've forgiven or understood you,

313
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,749
but I accept your apology.

314
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,337
Right. I think I found my real father.

315
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,840
His name is Gwon Yohan.

316
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:20,967
He was Hwang Hyeondo's friend.

317
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:22,719
Have you met him?

318
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:27,015
Gwon Yohan? You mean the old CEO?

319
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,100
He passed away a long time ago.

320
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,227
He passed away?

321
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,396
It's been more than 20 years.

322
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,567
The factory went bankrupt,
and he took his own life.

323
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,235
No.

324
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,781
He's already passed.

325
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,078
Bye.

326
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:09,516
Sir.

327
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,125
I'll stay as Lee Seungcheon.

328
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,427
You seem busy, so I'll make it short.

329
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:49,848
Should I say we're too different
or too busy to be more than friends?

330
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,939
What are you talking about?

331
00:30:58,439 --> 00:30:59,983
I'm reporting our breakup to the press.

332
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,652
It'll say I dumped you.

333
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,530
That's okay, right?

334
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,241
Yeojin.

335
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,951
I didn't know

336
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,998
-such a thing would happen to Mr. Lee.
-Yeojin.

337
00:31:16,124 --> 00:31:18,960
My dad's death isn't your fault.

338
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,253
Don't blame yourself.

339
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,675
Don't try to console me.

340
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,803
I actually started
to fall out of love with you.

341
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:32,557
It's true.

342
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:38,897
It's a lie.

343
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,900
I didn't want to lose

344
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,652
you.

345
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,906
But I know this is the end of us.

346
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,584
Thank you for everything, truly.

347
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,091
I told you. I'm dumping you.

348
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:10,511
You think I'm going to
shake your pitiful hand?

349
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,799
Why did you tell him?

350
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,677
If you hadn't told him,
Juntae wouldn't have died.

351
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,929
You killed him.

352
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:54,847
You killed my Juntae!

353
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:58,518
You killed him.

354
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,520
What?

355
00:33:00,603 --> 00:33:04,148
Had you admitted that you were his mom,
Juntae wouldn't have died.

356
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,697
You know that yourself.

357
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,910
Don't make me laugh.

358
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,081
It's because of you.

359
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:23,292
It's all because of you, Hwang Hyeondo.

360
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:52,155
Yohan, it's not my fault
that our Juntae died, is it?

361
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,158
Please tell me it's not.

362
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:06,711
Rumor says that Seo Youngshin is
Seo Juntae's mom.

363
00:34:06,794 --> 00:34:09,672
If that's true, who is his dad?

364
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,259
Could it be that rich ex-fiancé?

365
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,094
That's what you're so curious about?

366
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:18,389
Not the disappearance
of all those articles about Seo Juntae?

367
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,640
I mean,

368
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:22,894
a few articles said that Seo Juntae
hanged himself at the hospital,

369
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:24,604
but there's absolutely nothing these days.

370
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,938
Isn't it strange?

371
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,191
Because Dosin deleted them all.

372
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,737
-Yeojin.
-He didn't die at the hospital.

373
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:35,573
He shot himself in Hwang Hyeondo's house.

374
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,116
Bang.

375
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,538
Do you actually buy this?

376
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,957
How naive considering
you work for the broadcasting industry.

377
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,211
Na Juhee, let's talk for a moment.

378
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,929
Are you here for the program reshuffle?

379
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:01,557
No, I came to give an exclusive
to a director I know.

380
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,392
I'm calling off my engagement.

381
00:35:04,393 --> 00:35:06,646
Don't be too excited though.

382
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,023
As long as Seungcheon
stays as Hwang Taeyong,

383
00:35:09,357 --> 00:35:11,109
you can't be with him.

384
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,777
There's Hwang Hyeondo.

385
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,781
Thanks for your concern,

386
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,616
but I can take care of my life.

387
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,953
What you said about Seo Juntae…

388
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:24,664
You weren't joking, were you?

389
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,127
Right, it's true.

390
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,837
But it's not true anymore.

391
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:34,757
Dosin… Hwang Hyeondo

392
00:35:36,342 --> 00:35:39,428
can do anything.
Everything can be fabricated, right?

393
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:46,978
Fabricated?

394
00:35:48,104 --> 00:35:51,941
LAYOFF LIST OF ALL STRIKE LABORERS
SHUTDOWN OF ANSIN FACTORY

395
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:03,578
Don't forget this kind heart of his

396
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,663
as you become a competent businessman.

397
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,170
-Let's put this off for now.
-Sir?

398
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:16,507
But it's the president's direct orders.

399
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,634
You should approve it.

400
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:22,680
Real estate prices have risen, so if
the factory is moved to a third country,

401
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,807
the company will surely
make a lot of money.

402
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:28,477
But who will be responsible
for those who lose their jobs?

403
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:32,690
Small sacrifices are needed
for a greater purpose.

404
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,736
So the company will make a lot of money

405
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,905
while they deal with small sacrifices?

406
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,740
Don't be like this.

407
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,242
Everyone's already complaining
due to the short-selling.

408
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:45,077
-If you continue--
-Ah.

409
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,288
The short-selling.

410
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,249
Right, I should resolve that issue first.

411
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:52,001
But…

412
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,836
Mr. Hwang!

413
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:55,504
Look properly, you jobless fool.

414
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,465
You're jobless too.

415
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:59,175
I'm not jobless. I'm a streamer.

416
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:00,635
By the way,

417
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,804
I wonder if Seungcheon
and his mother are all right.

418
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:07,225
You know, it doesn't hit you at a funeral.

419
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,685
She's probably having it hard around now.

420
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,691
Right, I won't be able to stream online
at Seungcheon's place, will I?

421
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,446
What?

422
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,156
Come do it in my room.

423
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,450
Jeez.

424
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,954
Dosin Group is the problem.

425
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:30,289
They slipped through
with Seo Juntae's suicide,

426
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:32,291
but what about
innocent shareholders like me?

427
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,126
The stock price dropped like crazy.

428
00:37:34,210 --> 00:37:35,878
Is Hightech's short-selling still going?

429
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,713
It's a playground for stock manipulators.

430
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:41,259
I should have sold all my shares.

431
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,427
Goodness, my subscribers!

432
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,345
HWANG TAEYONG

433
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:47,473
-Hey.
-What?

434
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:50,393
Why is Hwang Taeyong calling you?

435
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:51,394
Beats me.

436
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,145
Show him.

437
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:54,689
HWANG TAEYONG

438
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:58,651
What do you want?

439
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,154
What?

440
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:04,949
What is it?

441
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,952
What? What did he say?

442
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:10,746
If you still have Dosin Hightech shares,
he wants you to keep them.

443
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,664
What?

444
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,626
Gosh.

445
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,545
What does that mean?

446
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,591
This is crazy!

447
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,302
What do you mean, short covering?

448
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,013
If I withdraw now,
I'll suffer a huge loss!

449
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,976
-Seongwon, you'll lose more tomorrow.
-This is annoying.

450
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:33,477
Do it now.

451
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,021
You guys too. Do it.

452
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,195
Just who is this guy?

453
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,449
Who's covering for all these shares?

454
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,284
Am I the only one in the dark?
Do you know?

455
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,244
If you do, tell me!

456
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,881
Who are you, people?

457
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,591
The Financial Supervisory Service.

458
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:08,012
We've confirmed
your illegal naked short-selling attempts.

459
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,013
Please come with us.

460
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:14,268
Damn it!

461
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:17,021
Thank you for helping me
despite the urgent request.

462
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,857
No problem. It's actually good for me.

463
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,401
I get to buy more shares at a low price.

464
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:26,405
Don't tell me you're planning
a hostile takeover.

465
00:39:26,489 --> 00:39:30,326
You know I always hold a long position
when it comes to you.

466
00:39:31,911 --> 00:39:34,997
When I was younger,
I often held short positions.

467
00:39:36,665 --> 00:39:37,917
I guess I've aged.

468
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,379
I want to bet my money on
what makes others successful, not plummet.

469
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:44,590
Is that why you're running
that 2,000-won diner?

470
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,510
Hmm, not exactly.

471
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,805
It's because of fear.

472
00:39:51,138 --> 00:39:54,600
When I started to make money,
I thought I was lucky.

473
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,227
As I kept making lots of money,

474
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:59,313
I began to think
I was brilliant and smart.

475
00:40:00,147 --> 00:40:02,900
But growing old, I got scared of money.

476
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:06,779
Then I came to think I should
earn less and share with others.

477
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:10,282
It may seem petty,
but that's why I run my diner.

478
00:40:10,866 --> 00:40:12,868
It's the same for this museum.

479
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,996
Did you collect
all these pieces of artwork?

480
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,416
No, quite a lot of them
belong to my rich friends.

481
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:21,460
Things that are a hassle to keep
but a waste to throw out.

482
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,338
Some of them are from your father.

483
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,804
I'm having dinner with my father.

484
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,684
Yes, Father.

485
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,777
You suddenly wanted to treat me to a meal,

486
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:50,030
but this is very unexpected.

487
00:40:53,325 --> 00:40:54,827
You've never had this before, have you?

488
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,829
I had it when I was a student.

489
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:01,041
This is a snack for rich people like us,

490
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:04,545
but some kids were so poor
that this is all they had to get by on.

491
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:12,845
Did you refuse to give your approval
thinking for those poor people?

492
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:16,390
Why did you hand
the Amikus kids over to the FSS?

493
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,185
Did you feel bad

494
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:21,103
that they were ripping off
those poor investors?

495
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,948
Father, I want to change.

496
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,242
All along,

497
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:39,163
I've neglected
something very important in life.

498
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,334
If I can… If that's really possible,

499
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:48,422
I want to change.

500
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,344
What made you want to change
all of a sudden?

501
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,306
Now that Lee Seungcheon's father is dead,

502
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:00,684
does the world seem different?

503
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,567
A few days ago, I heard something amusing.

504
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,403
Someone told me

505
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:14,740
that I looked poor.

506
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,158
Isn't that amusing?

507
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:19,161
But you know,

508
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:23,666
that person got me precisely right.

509
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,877
I'm a poor man.

510
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,964
The moment you think you're rich,

511
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:33,300
becoming poor for real
is all you're left with.

512
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,719
I'm poor. I don't have enough.
I'm still thirsty.

513
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:37,221
You need the desire to move forward.

514
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,016
You need the desire to move forward.

515
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:45,854
That's my priority. What is your priority?

516
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:51,277
Family.

517
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,532
They used to be a burden to me.

518
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:59,827
But I realized that
family was my priority.

519
00:43:01,328 --> 00:43:02,496
It was foolish of me.

520
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,041
I missed something that important in life.

521
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:09,003
Thank you for saying so.

522
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:13,299
Let me say one thing as your family.

523
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:18,929
Stop with your useless concerns
and come back to your old self.

524
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:23,976
Don't let anything distract or confuse you

525
00:43:25,644 --> 00:43:27,021
because I won't tolerate it.

526
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:34,028
You eat this triangular gimbap
to change things up.

527
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:36,238
It can't be your everyday meal.

528
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,701
But I'll enjoy it today.

529
00:43:58,177 --> 00:43:59,970
I wanted you to get over it.

530
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,392
But I guess you're still dwelling on it.

531
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:09,396
Then you leave me with no choice.

532
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:13,150
I'll have to get rid of your old self.

533
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:16,612
Two scoops, right?

534
00:44:16,695 --> 00:44:18,572
I can do it myself.

535
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,282
I'd better do that one.

536
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,118
No. Mom, stay seated.

537
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,953
-No.
-No, I want you to rest.

538
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:25,871
All right.

539
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,707
-Rest here.
-I'll do it. It's heavy.

540
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:31,043
-It's not heavy.
-It's heavy.

541
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,127
-No.
-Put it here.

542
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,971
I won't take long.
Let's go out after I finish this.

543
00:44:43,055 --> 00:44:44,973
I'm okay. Take your time.

544
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:06,829
Are you here for anything urgent?

545
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:11,667
I just feel a little uneasy.

546
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,670
I wanted to see you too.

547
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,467
What's making you feel uneasy?

548
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,177
You know,

549
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,806
I feel like I was mistaken

550
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,349
to think everything was settled.

551
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:31,103
Today, I met Yeojin

552
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:33,522
and heard how Seo Juntae died.

553
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,191
If…

554
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,193
Just what if

555
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:42,781
my dad's death was fabricated too?

556
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:48,871
It's just a silly idea, right?

557
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,208
Because Hyeondo told me to.

558
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,169
He said he'd bail me out.

559
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:56,503
I didn't kill President Na.

560
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:58,881
I didn't.

561
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,469
Munki, can you come in for a sec?

562
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,183
Why would you call me in
when you're on a date?

563
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,894
I asked you to check where my father was

564
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,353
regarding President Na.

565
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:14,980
Did you look into it?

566
00:46:15,063 --> 00:46:17,524
It's just as you know.
I didn't find anything in particular.

567
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,109
Really?

568
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:24,156
And I looked into Gwon Yohan as you asked.

569
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,450
He committed suicide.

570
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,746
Suicide?

571
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:33,415
But the first person who found his body
was President Hwang.

572
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:40,839
Hey, Taeyong. I'm coming now.

573
00:46:41,215 --> 00:46:42,341
Yes, be right there.

574
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,351
Why do you suddenly want to meet Taeyong?

575
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,394
And just who is Gwon Yohan?

576
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:31,515
Sir.

577
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:40,065
Let go of me!

578
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,195
What are you doing?

579
00:48:00,669 --> 00:48:01,670
Are you okay?

580
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,067
-Sir.
-I'm okay.

581
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,986
Stop right there.

582
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:28,155
Stop!

583
00:48:32,034 --> 00:48:32,868
Stop!

584
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,968
They seemed to follow me from the store.

585
00:48:50,844 --> 00:48:52,220
It's just too suspicious.

586
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,599
Munki. How did it go?

587
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,184
I lost them.

588
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,311
-They had accomplices.
-What?

589
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:01,521
They didn't seem like normal thugs.

590
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:05,067
They even had a car.
I think they were trying to abduct him.

591
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,320
Report this to the police and check
the security footage in the area.

592
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,237
Yes, sir.

593
00:49:14,076 --> 00:49:15,243
Can you think of a reason?

594
00:49:15,953 --> 00:49:17,162
Not really.

595
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,082
Who on earth did this?

596
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,503
Don't let anything distract or confuse you

597
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,672
because I won't tolerate it.

598
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:28,465
No way.

599
00:49:29,591 --> 00:49:30,425
My father?

600
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,470
But there's no reason for him to…

601
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,890
His name is Gwon Yohan.
He was Hwang Hyeondo's friend.

602
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,227
His friend?

603
00:49:41,645 --> 00:49:43,897
Does it mean they are the same age?

604
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,274
Go to the house of a boy your age.

605
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,819
Eat three meals with this spoon.

606
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,489
Then your life will be switched with his,

607
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:56,535
and his parents will become your parents.

608
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,079
-It was Gwon Yohan.
-What?

609
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,415
The one who hired those men just now

610
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,792
and murdered President Na.
It was all Gwon Yohan's doing.

611
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,920
He used the golden spoon
to become Hwang Hyeondo.

612
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,478
Don't go around alone for the time being.

613
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:26,273
I'll tell Munki to come right over.
Juhee, stay with him until then.

614
00:50:27,524 --> 00:50:29,568
-Where are you going?
-I have something to do.

615
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:34,281
He even tried to hurt Taeyong.
I can't just sit here.

616
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:49,921
LIST OF 2021 DOMESTIC

LIST OF BRIBERY FOR POLITICS AND BUSINESS

621
00:51:11,568 --> 00:51:12,861
Taeyong did?

622
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,200
No, leave him be.

623
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:20,243
Yes, good job.

624
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:29,836
Did you lop the tree today?

625
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,046
Yes.

626
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,633
Useless branches need to be cut off
for a tree to bear more fruit.

627
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,134
That's right.

628
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,136
But you wasted your effort.

629
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,764
This tree itself is useless now.

630
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:45,519
Cut it down.

631
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,705
It's 5:10 a.m.

632
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,543
Why are you out here?

633
00:52:10,127 --> 00:52:11,378
What did you do until this hour?

634
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:15,590
It's better you don't know.

635
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,260
You have too many secrets.

636
00:52:24,432 --> 00:52:26,852
Sometimes, I find it hard
to understand you.

637
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:29,771
You're overly attentive
to Lee Seungcheon's family too.

638
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,524
What on earth are your secrets?

639
00:52:35,944 --> 00:52:36,778
I'm sorry, Munki.

640
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,490
Even if I tell you, you won't understand.

641
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:43,910
But let me tell you one thing.

642
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:46,872
I'm going to attack my father.

643
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,208
Pretend you didn't hear it for your sake.

644
00:52:52,961 --> 00:52:54,129
That's upsetting.

645
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,633
Did you really think of me as a brother?

646
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:00,969
Maybe it's because I don't have parents,

647
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:03,013
but I don't really understand

648
00:53:05,265 --> 00:53:06,641
why you want to attack your father.

649
00:53:07,726 --> 00:53:08,894
But Taeyong.

650
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:15,025
Your choices weren't always right,
but I still think you're a good man.

651
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,612
Whatever your secrets are,

652
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:21,573
I'll help you.

653
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:29,164
I'm always on your side.

654
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,922
Munki.

655
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,509
Thanks.

656
00:54:27,472 --> 00:54:29,391
Come and buy a golden spoon!

657
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:31,851
It's 30,000 won only for today!

658
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:37,482
Hold on a second.

659
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,777
Today marks ten years.

660
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:46,491
Just why isn't that Seungcheon coming?

661
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:52,455
Mm?

662
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,696
Wait here.

663
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:53,141
Just come in.

664
00:55:57,479 --> 00:56:00,774
Why did you want
to see me here of all places?

665
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,192
Wait, there.

666
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,526
That's where

667
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:07,697
my friend died.

668
00:56:17,832 --> 00:56:19,084
His name was Gwon Yohan.

669
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:21,961
He was a very close friend of mine.

670
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:26,841
I heard you looked into him and me lately.

671
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,970
You could have asked me directly.
Then I would have told you everything.

672
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:37,143
Even that you are Gwon Yohan,
not Hwang Hyeondo?

673
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,690
Nice to meet you.

674
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:45,860
Mr. Gwon Yohan.

675
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,285
At last,

676
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,288
we meet like this,

677
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:01,459
Lee Seungcheon.

678
00:57:18,768 --> 00:57:21,396
Since when have you known
that I was Lee Seungcheon?

679
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,857
When you first came to my house.

680
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,537
Hey. You forgot to take your thing.

681
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:41,499
I hope you will never
bring something like this here.

682
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,752
I knew instinctively
when I saw that golden spoon in your hand.

683
00:57:48,339 --> 00:57:49,340
That's right.

684
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:53,470
I was so poor
that I wanted to become rich.

685
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:56,264
But why did you use it?

686
00:57:56,931 --> 00:57:58,141
You were already rich.

687
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:00,894
You had a lot of money.

688
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:04,105
You were well-off, so why?

689
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:07,400
I had a lot of money?

690
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:13,490
Have you ever read the Bible?

691
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,578
Even if you replaced the word
"God" with "money,"

692
00:58:18,661 --> 00:58:21,414
it wouldn't make any difference
in this world.

693
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,380
Good and evil.

694
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:32,550
Life and death. Eternity and resurrection.

695
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:37,805
Even God's path.
Everything is managed by money.

696
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:41,559
A faith called "money."

697
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:46,814
I chose that path.

698
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,109
Then did you kill President Na

699
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:52,695
because he got in your way?

700
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:54,072
That's right.

701
00:58:56,074 --> 00:58:57,450
He cost too much money.

702
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,369
And he wasn't going to change.

703
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:02,914
So I killed him, I guess.

704
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:04,541
Even so, how could you commit murder?

705
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,125
I didn't commit murder.

706
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,961
I just got rid of the uncertainty

707
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:11,506
which was hindering my plan.

708
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:13,591
What about Taeyong?

709
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:15,927
Were you going to kill him

710
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:18,680
because he got in your way?

711
00:59:20,515 --> 00:59:21,516
Well…

712
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,811
Anyway, as long as that boy
had the golden spoon,

713
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:26,604
I couldn't be at ease.

714
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,481
Of course, it failed because of you.

715
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:35,488
Gwon Yohan.

716
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:37,949
You're a monster.

717
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:48,876
You are no different.

718
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:52,839
Son.

719
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:58,761
You're just like me.

720
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,724
I haven't given up on you yet.

721
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,273
Live as my son.

722
01:00:20,408 --> 01:00:21,492
And if I say no?

723
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,496
The golden spoon granny said

724
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,874
that whoever uses the golden spoon

725
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,209
is bound to pay the price.

726
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:34,297
That applies only to those
with fragile hearts.

727
01:00:34,380 --> 01:00:37,842
No, you will pay the price too.

728
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,264
They're here.

729
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:46,184
They're from the prosecution.

730
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,979
Dosin's secrets you told me.

731
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,858
I didn't think I'd use them this way.

732
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,611
Those secrets were to be kept between us.

733
01:00:56,694 --> 01:00:58,946
Don't feel too wronged.

734
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,032
I'll go with you.

735
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,410
We stole other people's lives.

736
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,290
I need to pay the price too.

737
01:01:10,541 --> 01:01:11,751
Let's go together,

738
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,088
Father.

739
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,344
What did I

740
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:26,724
do so wrong to deserve this?

741
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,101
Have you forgotten?

742
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,105
Paper companies,
embezzlement, tax evasion…

743
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:33,856
There are tons.

744
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:36,234
Every secret you shared with me.

745
01:01:38,361 --> 01:01:40,363
I handed it all to the prosecution.

746
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,244
But did you think

747
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,664
I was clueless about it?

748
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:54,502
You alone will pay for all those sins,

749
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,004
including the murder of President Na.

750
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,297
You killed him.

751
01:01:58,381 --> 01:01:59,716
No, you killed him.

752
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:01,926
Taeyong's jacket with President Na's
bloodstain on it…

753
01:02:02,552 --> 01:02:03,761
I mean, your jacket.

754
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:06,222
I handed it to the prosecution.

755
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,557
Mr. Hwang Taeyong.

756
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,727
You're under arrest
for the murder of Na Sangguk.

757
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,146
You have the right to remain silent

758
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,272
and to consult an attorney.

759
01:02:14,355 --> 01:02:17,191
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

760
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,318
You should pay the price for your sins.

761
01:02:20,987 --> 01:02:23,281
I won't go easy on you
just because you're my son.

762
01:02:23,948 --> 01:02:25,199
You can take him.

763
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:29,162
Damn it!

764
01:02:30,872 --> 01:02:31,789
Get him!

765
01:02:34,125 --> 01:02:35,501
JUNE 20, 2012

766
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,003
JUNE 20, 2012
PRESIDENT NA SANGGUK

767
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,552
A NEW MESSAGE HAS ARRIVED

768
01:02:48,514 --> 01:02:52,852
PRESIDENT NA SANGGUK

769
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,243
What do you think?
It's footage from 24 years ago,

770
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,411
but the quality is not bad.

771
01:03:10,495 --> 01:03:12,288
I'm guessing you have something to say.

772
01:03:12,371 --> 01:03:13,873
Meet me at 12 tomorrow.

773
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:16,834
I'll tell you where later.

774
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:57,333
BIBLE

775
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,884
We agreed to meet tomorrow.

776
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:10,388
President Hwang,
you must have been pretty shaken.

777
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:12,640
Was it Taeyong just now?

778
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,602
He stormed out half-dazed.
Did you talk about something interesting?

779
01:04:18,646 --> 01:04:20,064
Nothing much.

780
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:22,400
Let's talk outside.

781
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,237
I helped you grow

782
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:29,699
your pathetic little cable TV.

783
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:33,286
But I guess it wasn't nearly enough.

784
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:37,164
Let me ask you.

785
01:04:38,958 --> 01:04:42,169
What more do you want from me
that you sent such a thing?

786
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:43,713
I need to survive, you see.

787
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:51,804
Promise that you'll save my company.

788
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:55,850
Then I will give you
the original copy of the footage.

789
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:03,608
These are certificates of deposit.

790
01:05:05,109 --> 01:05:06,277
This much

791
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:08,863
should be enough to save your company.

792
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:12,950
Thank you.

793
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:15,328
Give it to me first.

794
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,622
Yes, right.

795
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:26,213
Here.

796
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,260
I want the original.

797
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:33,304
This is all I have. This is the original.

798
01:05:33,387 --> 01:05:34,639
Can I trust you?

799
01:05:34,722 --> 01:05:35,973
Believe me, President Hwang.

800
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:39,226
This really is all I have.

801
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:45,399
All right, I'll believe you.

802
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:49,946
Thank you, President Hwang.

803
01:05:57,161 --> 01:06:00,289
I will never forget your kindness.

804
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:06,379
I didn't want to go this far either.

805
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:12,134
But I've always wondered.

806
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:15,346
Why did you kill Gwon Yohan?

807
01:06:26,357 --> 01:06:27,608
Because like you,

808
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:31,821
he got in my way.

809
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:34,740
So I killed him.

810
01:06:56,137 --> 01:06:58,014
It wasn't Gwon Yohan that I killed.

811
01:07:02,101 --> 01:07:03,227
It was Hwang Hyeondo.

812
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,150
President Na. It's me, Taeyong.

813
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:10,526
President Na.

814
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:12,903
President Na!

815
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,114
President Na.

816
01:07:15,698 --> 01:07:17,700
It's me, Taeyong.
Why aren't you answering?

817
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:20,369
President Na.

818
01:07:23,748 --> 01:07:24,749
President Na?

819
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,289
Attorney Go, what should we do?

820
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:09,752
Taeyong seems to have caused trouble.

821
01:08:18,511 --> 01:08:20,805
THE GOLDEN SPOON

822
01:08:20,888 --> 01:08:21,889
SPECIAL THANKS TO NA INWOO
FOR HIS GUEST APPEARANCE
