1
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,867
Wow. You look completely different.

2
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,162
The lousy Hwang Taeyong
is the CEO of Most Lab?

3
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,830
No.

4
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:42,375
You're now the CEO of Dosin Hightech.

5
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:47,172
Right, I went a little overboard
about my dad the other day.

6
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:50,216
I guess I wanted to resent your family
for ruining my family.

7
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:52,427
Since you're rich, let me go this once.

8
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,013
I will.

9
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:57,974
But I won't do the interview.

10
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,144
Hey, I'm preparing for a special
about start-up companies.

11
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,231
Share your tips on our show
from incubating to exiting.

12
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,608
Come on.

13
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,069
Don't worry. We'll never criticize you.

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,863
Actually, we can't. We're from DSTV.

15
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:13,990
Dosin Group's affiliate.

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,285
Come on and do it
for our friendship's sake.

17
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,537
Help me out.

18
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,706
Taeyong already said no.

19
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:24,501
Knock it off.

20
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,337
Others might think you're hitting on him.

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,630
Have some manners.

22
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,131
Yeojin.

23
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,301
I'll see you around.

24
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,224
I'm glad you turned her down.

25
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,143
She wants to interview you
to find faults with you.

26
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:43,478
I know.

27
00:01:44,354 --> 00:01:46,940
All right, I'll see you around.

28
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,569
These are for me, right?

29
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:53,822
Thanks. They're pretty.

30
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,407
I can't believe you fooled me too.

31
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,410
I'll forgive you for your fabulous return.

32
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,457
We can now get on with our wedding, right?

33
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,042
Suit yourself.

34
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:11,506
-Cheers.
-Goodness.

35
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:13,508
Mm.

36
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,804
Hwang Taeyong, that bastard.

37
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:22,684
I thought he was different
from the other golden spoons.

38
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:26,104
Rich people are all the same.

39
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:30,441
You're the real bastard.

40
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,819
You told me that Taeyong was your boss
only after resigning!

41
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,489
Also, did you get to talk to Juhee?

42
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:37,907
She asked about your company.

43
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,618
Documentary Note wants
to interview Taeyong.

44
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:44,164
-Juhee would?
-I told her everything.

45
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,542
That he skipped employment succession
when he sold off the company

46
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,837
and that he manipulated stock prices
to buy Dosin Hightech's shares.

47
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,963
Jeez.

48
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:56,843
Hey, you should be trying to ride
on his coattails, not acting so noble.

49
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,721
How are you ever going
to become rich like this?

50
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:00,972
Whatever.

51
00:03:01,055 --> 00:03:02,932
Rich?

52
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,935
Guys.

53
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:07,812
If you could become rich,

54
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:12,150
would you swap your parents?

55
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,735
It's just a thought.

56
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,571
-What's this crap?
-What's this crap?

57
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:20,950
Right?

58
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,500
What is this?

59
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:33,546
"A 30,000-won golden spoon
that can make you become rich."

60
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,965
"Three chances?"

61
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:40,178
BECOME RICH AND PAY OFF
MY FAMILY'S DEBT!!!

62
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,682
"Becoming rich by swapping your parents?"

63
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,691
EPISODE 10

64
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,902
Hwang Taeyong is already a CEO.

65
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,322
What have you been doing, Lee Seungcheon?

66
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,255
BASED ON THE NAVER WEBTOON
THE GOLDEN SPOON BY HD3

67
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,297
Mom.

68
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,302
Did you drink?

69
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,640
Dongkyung quit his job,
so we grabbed a beer together.

70
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,934
Why did he quit?
He said it was a good company.

71
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,686
It couldn't have been easy
getting that job.

72
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,564
Mom.

73
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:35,733
I'm sorry.

74
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,990
Your son is still jobless,
not making any money.

75
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,285
What are you talking about?

76
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,120
I know my son is doing the best he can.

77
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,373
Stop being silly and give it to me.
It's heavy. Let me carry it.

78
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:57,171
Mom. When I make money,
I'll get you an apartment first.

79
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:00,133
We'll leave this
moldy house with roaches behind,

80
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,553
and move to an 85 square meter house
with three rooms and two bathrooms.

81
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,513
I'll make sure to get you one.

82
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,640
Thanks for saying so.

83
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,894
Hey, son. I see you ran into your mom.

84
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:13,271
-Are you going somewhere?
-What?

85
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,689
Are you off to buy drinks again?

86
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,317
-Gosh, how did you know?
-Goodness.

87
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,320
Son, how about we have a drink?
It's been a while.

88
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,821
-I'm in!
-All right.

89
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,073
Then I'll go get some drinks.

90
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,534
Goodness. No, my dear son.
Please go inside.

91
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,620
I'll go get them quickly, so go on inside.

92
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,497
-Let's go inside.
-Go on.

93
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:33,875
-Hurry back.
-It won't take long.

94
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,507
He must've struggled so much
because of his poor parents…

95
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,971
that he came up with such a storyline.

96
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,727
I'm sorry, Seungcheon.

97
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,280
I told them to get rid of the minutes
at the board meeting,

98
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:06,407
so you don't have to worry.

99
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,869
We'll say you resigned from your position
for personal reasons.

100
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:17,668
What is it?

101
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,380
I'm wondering what's on your mind.

102
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:23,257
Now that Taeyong
has made a flashy comeback,

103
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,759
you could just dump me.

104
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,638
Why are you trying to recycle me?

105
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,223
Juntae.

106
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,102
I'm reminded of the day
I met you for the first time.

107
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,778
How old were you then? A middle schooler?

108
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,697
You seemed all confident,

109
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:52,703
but your nails were all gone.

110
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,748
Just like when Taeyong was little.

111
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,962
That was a long time ago.

112
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,047
I pitied you.

113
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,091
And I thought I could trust you.

114
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:06,300
Because pitiful kids are

115
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:09,971
bound to be loyal to those who trust them.

116
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:15,726
That's right. I've always wanted
to win your favor.

117
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,645
Thank you for understanding how I--

118
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,358
But you dare to touch my money?

119
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,319
If you mess with my money one more time,

120
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:29,323
it won't just be your nails.
You'll end up losing your hands then.

121
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,077
Put the slush fund back in its place.

122
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,537
Of course,

123
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,666
you probably prepared it for me, right?

124
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,009
Go on.

125
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:54,348
Lay low until I call you in.

126
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:10,990
You want to interview Taeyong?

127
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,577
I'm sorry for making a sudden visit
to ask such a favor.

128
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,788
If it can be of help to you, I will ask.

129
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,166
But this is unexpected.

130
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,711
I thought you'd find us uncomfortable
because we took over UBS.

131
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,715
That's all in the past.
It's a long time ago.

132
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:32,803
I'll try talking to him,
but I can't guarantee anything.

133
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:34,472
Thank you, ma'am.

134
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,938
So she wants to dig into Taeyong?

135
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:45,691
I'd love that.

136
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,069
Are you leaving already?

137
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,242
Yes, after stopping by the bathroom.

138
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,577
The bathroom is this way.

139
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,183
I'm certain Taeyong killed your father.

140
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,434
Do you have proof?

141
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:23,646
President Na's bloodstain
was on Taeyong's jacket.

142
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,634
Of course he wouldn't have
kept that jacket.

143
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,532
Congratulations, sir.

144
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,242
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

145
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:20,328
It's such a shame.

146
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:22,371
We should've held
a grand inauguration ceremony

147
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,748
no matter how busy we were.

148
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,459
Although it's late,
should we prepare for one?

149
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:28,294
It's all a waste of time and money.

150
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,546
While we're at it,

151
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,215
some of you here

152
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:36,594
have sent me gifts and emails of loyalty.

153
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,557
Work for the company, not me.

154
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,645
Our new recruits receive an annual salary
of a little more than 40 million won.

155
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,855
You receive at least a billion won.

156
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,482
That means

157
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:53,444
you need to be able to handle
the work of 25 new employees.

158
00:10:56,697 --> 00:10:58,741
Since I'm also new here,

159
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:01,160
I'll start with the annual salary
of 40 million won.

160
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,079
I look forward to your future guidance.

161
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,550
Are we supposed to deduct
our salaries too?

162
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:19,136
He's saying that we're fired
if we don't do the money's worth.

163
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,180
Gosh, it's going to be tough from now on.

164
00:11:25,726 --> 00:11:27,812
-Goodness.
-This is not good.

165
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,315
Aren't you being too harsh?

166
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:34,110
It doesn't matter.

167
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:36,654
I have no leisure to coddle anyone.

168
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:39,824
It took me ten years to reach this far.

169
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:43,411
Since you dragged Seo Juntae down,
I thought you could take it slow now.

170
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,040
Do you trust my father?

171
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,543
The real fight begins now.

172
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:53,546
He won't go easy on me
just because I'm his son.

173
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,090
I must defeat my father.

174
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:58,884
Brace yourself too.

175
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:01,762
Yes, sir.

176
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,849
But it's time to go.

177
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,645
Ah.

178
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,147
Meeting the bride's family?

179
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,983
You could decide the wedding date, Mr. Oh…

180
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,527
I mean, my future in-law.

181
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:18,112
We'll adjust to your schedule.

182
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:19,113
Ah.

183
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,782
Thank you.

184
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:25,286
I can't believe
my Yeojin's finally getting married.

185
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:29,081
She may seem cold on the outside,
but she's a kind-hearted girl.

186
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:32,042
As a little girl, she used
to offer money and food

187
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,919
to her poor friend.

188
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,671
She got scolded a lot.

189
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,799
Every time, I told her

190
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,886
that money is like blood.

191
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,681
What happens if you donate blood
to a person with a different blood type?

192
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,807
They end up dying.

193
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,727
Thus, our blood… Our money

194
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,896
must not be mixed with just anyone's.

195
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:55,024
It must be mixed with those at our level.

196
00:12:57,693 --> 00:12:58,944
Aren't I right?

197
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,696
Mm.

198
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,241
-You're right, indeed.
-Right?

199
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,911
But will you be okay?

200
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,914
-Excuse me?
-Like you said,

201
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:13,292
marriage is about mixing blood and money.

202
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:14,919
Will you be able to handle it?

203
00:13:15,002 --> 00:13:18,214
You're not at our level.

204
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:20,174
Honey.

205
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:24,637
I guess she drank a little too much.
Please be understanding.

206
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,223
No, I'm totally sober.

207
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:30,893
I'm so curious.

208
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:32,394
Why would Taeyong

209
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,564
want to marry the daughter
of Oh Construction

210
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,983
with a market value
that's less than a trillion won?

211
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,027
Because she's pretty?

212
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:42,655
Hmm.

213
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:44,949
A girl like her is common.

214
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,576
Mother.

215
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:52,540
She's the person I chose.

216
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,377
She's trusted and helped me
for the past ten years.

217
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:59,129
Isn't that enough?

218
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:03,384
Ah. I see.

219
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,485
You can be quite touching at times.

220
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,698
You promised you'd help me,

221
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,700
and you kept the promise.

222
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,497
So I should keep mine too.

223
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,834
Because we're good business partners.

224
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:38,961
Take care on your way back.

225
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,096
Business partners?

226
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,229
I get that you're upset because of Juntae,

227
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,815
but you should've gone
after me or Taeyong.

228
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,191
You got the wrong target.

229
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:03,611
Ah. Should I?

230
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:05,529
Fine.

231
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:08,282
Then move Taeyong
out of this house immediately.

232
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,950
Have him live alone.

233
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,203
He's my son, and I'm proud of him.

234
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:14,914
This is my answer.

235
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,419
Yes, I'm sure.

236
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:33,682
Juhee was here today. She asked me
to help her get an interview with you.

237
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,268
I wonder what her problem is.

238
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,813
Ah, because of President Na?

239
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:42,191
Too bad for you.

240
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,401
She seemed very determined.

241
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,247
Because we're good business partners.

242
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:05,464
Lee Seungcheon,
you shouldn't behave like this.

243
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,094
You don't know the last rule
of the golden spoon.

244
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:14,306
You choose to live as Oh Yeojin
for the rest of your life?

245
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,061
Then I will tell you the last rule.

246
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,108
If another person eats
with this golden spoon,

247
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:27,778
they will gain the memory of its owner.

248
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:32,533
So make sure you keep it safely with you.

249
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:38,622
It's been so tiring to protect this
for more than ten years.

250
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,666
Should I live like this until I die?

251
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,626
That's ridiculous.

252
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,420
This is about going against one's fate.

253
00:16:44,503 --> 00:16:46,046
I told you.

254
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:50,217
You need to pay the price
for the chance you've been given.

255
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,766
If you don't want
to pay the price for nothing,

256
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:00,561
be careful.

257
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,398
Yeah.
No, stretch it more to the back.

258
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,441
Yes, sir.

259
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:08,235
So that it flows naturally
with the interview.

260
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,528
-Okay.
-Good.

261
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,698
Stop, my goodness.

262
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,992
Is it so hard to make it natural?
It's still choppy there.

263
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:16,076
-Again.
-Yes, sir.

264
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:19,955
He got fired because of us.
Why don't you give him a raise?

265
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,875
I can't do that.
We have regulations to follow.

266
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:26,795
You even drew webtoons,
so why are you so horrible at editing?

267
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,422
-Do better!
-Okay.

268
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:29,590
Producer Byeon.

269
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,678
No, I'll do better.

270
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,473
Also, Ms. Na.

271
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,725
Did you interview
the prince of Dosin as you said?

272
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,729
-The thing is…
-Juhee! Juhee!

273
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,648
Downstairs…

274
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,859
Ms. Wang, what about it?
Give us the full sentence.

275
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,778
Hwang Taeyong's here.

276
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:53,989
You mean CEO Hwang Taeyong's here?

277
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,756
This is our CEO.

278
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,882
I've heard a lot about you.

279
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,134
I'm the chief director.

280
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:21,016
Excuse me for a moment.

281
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,853
Ms. Na Juhee?

282
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,150
I'm here for the interview
with Documentary Note.

283
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,660
What are you doing here?

284
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:45,916
-Well…
-He's just a part-timer.

285
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,210
Let's talk inside.

286
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,379
Please follow me.

287
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,672
Move it, come on.

288
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:53,757
This way.

289
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:06,145
DOCUMENTARY NOTE

290
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:08,772
Hurry up.

291
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,566
All right.

292
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:11,650
Hey.

293
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,237
Go and get eight cups of iced Americano.

294
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,991
Wait. We don't know what he wants,
so get a latte and iced tea too.

295
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,617
Don't lose the card and get the receipt.

296
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,077
-Okay.
-Hurry.

297
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:23,787
All right.

298
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:37,050
I heard you declined the request.

299
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,429
Yes, I did. But then,

300
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:43,765
Ms. Na visited my house herself,

301
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,892
despite the hassle.

302
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,396
She even asked my mother to persuade me.

303
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,732
I wonder what she wants to know about me.

304
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:56,195
Goodness, I'm really sorry.

305
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,698
It was very tactless and rude of her.

306
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,492
Ms. Na, what are you waiting for?
Apologize now.

307
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,119
I'll do the interview.

308
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,707
I'd like to know what it is about me
that she's dying to know.

309
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:12,294
Thank you for your kind gesture.

310
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,838
The filming will take place
about three times in total.

311
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,131
The questions and setting--

312
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,091
My secretary will contact you
for the details.

313
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:21,678
I'll reach out to you.

314
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:25,557
Sir!

315
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,648
Hey, what's going on?

316
00:20:32,731 --> 00:20:34,358
What matters is he's doing the interview.

317
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,949
We'll do our best to prepare for the shoot

318
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:45,452
so that you won't face any inconveniences.

319
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,537
Hey, Lee Seungcheon!

320
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,876
What took you so long?

321
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,711
Just how far did you go?

322
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,047
The nearby cafe--

323
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:00,884
Hey, our guests are leaving.
We couldn't even serve them a cup of tea.

324
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,845
What is wrong with you these days?

325
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,850
What's gotten into you?
Give me back my card first.

326
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,395
Let's go.

327
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,231
My card.

328
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:16,275
You probably left it there.

329
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,527
Hurry up.

330
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,154
You're hopeless.

331
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,003
You look down.

332
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,256
I'm not down.

333
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,717
Why did you change your mind
about the interview?

334
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,136
Because it can help
to promote our company.

335
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:47,806
Is that all?

336
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,685
What else could there be?

337
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,841
I lied.

338
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,052
That's not all.

339
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:28,805
Actually,

340
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,683
I wanted to see you.

341
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,210
Juhee…

342
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:47,175
Why are you so surprised?
I'm not a stranger here.

343
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:49,052
Haven't you heard?

344
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,762
Taeyong's coming.

345
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:55,267
That's good. I haven't seen
my nephew in a while.

346
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,393
Mm.

347
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:02,607
By the way, I'm sorry
you have to cough up the 70 billion won.

348
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:05,360
Hey, don't be so mean.

349
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,363
It's 67 billion won. You silly.

350
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:12,075
Juntae, don't pay for your drinks today.
You have to save up.

351
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,535
Hey, give me a glass.

352
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:14,870
Here.

353
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:20,000
I've missed you, you know.

354
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:28,049
Take a seat and drink some more.

355
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:30,343
You sure are the only friend
who cares for me.

356
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,686
I may save up on drinks,
but not on hospital fees.

357
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:40,854
Send me the bill.

358
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:44,191
Hey, are you okay?

359
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,700
My dear nephew,

360
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,328
why do you always follow me on my path?

361
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,040
First, the CEO of Dosin Hightech,
and now the president of Amikus?

362
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,543
Think as you please.

363
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,212
How shameless of you.

364
00:25:06,129 --> 00:25:09,674
-A murderer should reflect on oneself.
-No, you are the murderer.

365
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,718
What's this crap?

366
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:15,138
The culprit of the St. Jerome School
shooting incident from 16 years ago.

367
00:25:16,223 --> 00:25:17,807
It was you, not me.

368
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,269
Don't make me laugh. Do you have proof?

369
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,274
What if I remembered it?

370
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,111
Mr. Smile.

371
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:36,201
I remember you in a smile T-shirt
shooting kids.

372
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,427
Did he really remember it?

373
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,764
I should've killed him too back then.

374
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,653
-Youngshin?
-Why did you do that to Seongwon?

375
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,448
I had to beg his mother so much.

376
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,869
-Get up now.
-Leave me alone!

377
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:25,875
What is wrong with you?

378
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,711
Had our parents been alive,

379
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:30,672
would I have been treated like this?

380
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,554
Don't say that. You have me.

381
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,433
I'll make sure you get Dosin
by any means possible.

382
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,351
Then kill Taeyong.

383
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,311
What?

384
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:47,355
Why? You said you'd do anything.
Can't you do it?

385
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:52,777
Then don't even offer to help.

386
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,956
I think it's time now.

387
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:09,085
Release an article
about Dosin Hightech's physical division.

388
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,212
The shareholders will strongly oppose it.

389
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,923
Most of all, CEO Hwang Taeyong's opinion--

390
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:14,883
He's my son.

391
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,303
My opinion is his opinion.

392
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,972
-Proceed with it.
-Yes, sir.

393
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,604
We need to talk.

394
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,774
-I think we can talk at home.
-No!

395
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,693
If I don't do this,
you won't listen to me!

396
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,545
Did you have to do that in my office?

397
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,049
Unless you want me

398
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:59,177
to gather all my shares
and get in your way with everything,

399
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:03,306
give my Juntae another chance.

400
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,434
Why?

401
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,605
Why must I do that?

402
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,441
Because he's your son?

403
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:16,695
Honey?

404
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,489
Are you surprised?
Did you think I was clueless?

405
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,075
How did you…

406
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:27,789
Be careful.

407
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,084
Don't make me tell the truth.

408
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,086
The truth doesn't pull people together.

409
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,379
It rather...

410
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,507
makes people hate one another.

411
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:41,094
I don't want to hate you.

412
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:54,524
Youngshin.

413
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:58,987
Without you, Juntae wouldn't be here.

414
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,204
Act like a mother.

415
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:51,623
Had I not known that
Seo Juntae's nickname was Mr. Smile,

416
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,458
I wouldn't have figured out
the real culprit.

417
00:29:54,167 --> 00:29:56,461
It's too bad
that the one who drew it is dead.

418
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,005
He was the only witness.

419
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,342
Seo Juntae probably killed
President Na as well, right?

420
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,221
But we only have circumstantial evidence.
We need something concrete.

421
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,601
Haven't you found
Park Sanggu's whereabouts yet?

422
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,562
We can't locate him since he left
for the Philippines. We'll keep looking.

423
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,485
Right. And Ms. Juhee went to meet

424
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,778
the head of the investigation.

425
00:30:21,861 --> 00:30:23,279
Juhee did that?

426
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:27,742
It'll be dangerous
if she meets Seo Juntae.

427
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:31,204
Keep a close eye on her
and the others related to this.

428
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,121
Yes, sir.

429
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:55,144
This looks appetizing.

430
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,190
It smells good too.

431
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:00,692
SUCCESS AFTER SUCCESS
SIDE DISH STORE

432
00:31:03,736 --> 00:31:06,990
Just look at it.
Isn't our son so good at drawing?

433
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:08,491
-Let me see.
-Right?

434
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,742
Right.

435
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:14,622
I wish we could have
let him keep drawing as he wanted.

436
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,040
We were too poor back then.

437
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,334
I still feel sorry for it.

438
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:23,256
No, don't feel sorry. It's all my fault.

439
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:25,925
What?

440
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,845
When he said
he wanted to draw for a living, I said,

441
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,306
"How can you say that
even after seeing how my life has been?"

442
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:34,225
He may not have ended up like me.

443
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:36,269
Why did I say such a thing?

444
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,521
-Honey.
-Yes?

445
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,775
Do you want to draw again?

446
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:45,361
No, I…

447
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:47,530
Gosh, it's not like I want to draw again.

448
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,157
I just feel sorry for Seungcheon.

449
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,329
Only if it were possible,

450
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,040
I'd swap us with rich parents for him.

451
00:31:58,124 --> 00:31:59,334
I'd really do that.

452
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:02,211
-What…
-I mean, just the dad.

453
00:32:04,088 --> 00:32:06,090
-That makes no sense.
-Your delivery's here.

454
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:07,425
Where should I put them?

455
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:09,260
-Over there.
-What are all those?

456
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,347
-They're all for us?
-You ordered a lot. Have a good day.

457
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,932
-You too.
-Goodbye.

458
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,019
-Hold on.
-Who sent these?

459
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,522
Yeojin, they delivered it.

460
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:23,358
Good work.

461
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:26,069
I hope Seungcheon's parents love my gifts.

462
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:30,073
I'm going to have his older sister
do my hair and makeup.

463
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,579
What are you doing?

464
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,583
You have no fever.
Now, what's your problem?

465
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,586
There's no reason
to win Lee Seungcheon's family's favor.

466
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,923
I'm getting married.

467
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:49,926
To think I'll be Taeyong's wife,
I want to be kinder.

468
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,304
Do you like him that much?

469
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,099
Enough to make you want
to become kind out of the blue?

470
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,642
Yes, I like him so much.

471
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,523
Hey, Oh Yeojin.

472
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:05,733
Don't like him too much.

473
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,151
He is--

474
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:10,154
He's what? What about him?

475
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:15,660
You don't know he's appearing
on Na Juhee's show, do you?

476
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,705
I bet that bastard
doesn't tell you such a thing.

477
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:23,042
Yes, I'm on my way out now.

478
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:29,924
-What are you doing here?
-You.

479
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,678
Did you not get my warning
when I told you not to hit on Taeyong?

480
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,138
Oh. That?

481
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:38,182
I got it, and I know what you mean.

482
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:41,102
But I'm just doing my job
as a screenwriter.

483
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:42,020
I'm busy, bye.

484
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,354
Is that so?

485
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:45,606
Then I should do my job as his fiancée.

486
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:48,693
Hey.

487
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,154
-Let go of me! Hey!
-Is it your first time seeing Yeojin?

488
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,530
She's quite feisty.

489
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:53,948
But she's cute too.

490
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,744
-Don't mind this, and go back to work.
-Why do you keep prowling around Taeyong?

491
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:59,787
You're no longer
the UBS president's daughter!

492
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:00,705
Hey.

493
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,463
I was going to let it go.

494
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:12,216
My life has been so tough
for the past ten years.

495
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,595
Just guess how many gangsters

496
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:18,556
and loan sharks I've met in this industry.

497
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,225
Hey. Let go of me!

498
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,480
I guess you're bothered
because I was once his fiancée.

499
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:28,566
Don't worry.
I have zero feelings for him whatsoever.

500
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,660
Hey, move.

501
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:41,871
Why that little…

502
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:46,334
Who's worried about you?

503
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:51,130
I'm worried about Taeyong… No, Seungcheon.

504
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:56,302
What would you say was the toughest moment
for Most Lab's development?

505
00:34:57,804 --> 00:34:58,805
Well…

506
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,100
I couldn't sleep.

507
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,145
Since I left for the US, I couldn't sleep
in peace even for a moment.

508
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:10,316
But what troubled me more
was that I didn't have money.

509
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,611
The only son of Dosin Group's president
had no money?

510
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,029
That doesn't seem plausible.

511
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,781
I didn't get any help from my father.

512
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:20,201
I developed the company
with government aid

513
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,536
and angel investors.

514
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:25,123
Still, it was possible
because your father is Hwang Hyeondo, no?

515
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:30,086
Being someone's son
is a seed money of sorts.

516
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,713
Not everyone finds success
with seed money.

517
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,924
Just because I started ahead of others,

518
00:35:35,424 --> 00:35:37,969
you cannot belittle
my hard-earned achievements.

519
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:41,973
That will be all for the interview.

520
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:57,321
ORGANIZE INSERTS, RESERVE AN EDITING ROOM

521
00:36:19,802 --> 00:36:21,512
Juhee, I finished the editing.

522
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,598
Don't work too late.

523
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:24,932
Cheer up!

524
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,686
Wasn't Na Juhee so impressive back there?

525
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,648
She asked Hwang Taeyong out to dinner.

526
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,400
That's her big picture.

527
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:38,070
She wants to get back together
with her ex-fiancé.

528
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:41,282
Money trumps all when it comes to men.

529
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:44,035
Being handsome like me
can't impress anyone.

530
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,997
-Are you kidding me?
-Producer Byeon.

531
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,505
I said it was my treat.
You could've chosen a better place.

532
00:36:57,465 --> 00:36:59,634
I thought of this place
in the States sometimes.

533
00:37:00,593 --> 00:37:01,844
It's still the same.

534
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:04,555
Anyway, thanks for letting us
film your house.

535
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,893
But is that enough?

536
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,395
It's not what you really want.

537
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,150
-President Na--
-Hey.

538
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,903
I said I went overboard and apologized.

539
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:21,030
I'm over it now. I mean it.

540
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,409
Then why did you visit
the head of the investigation?

541
00:37:27,453 --> 00:37:28,829
Let me give you a piece of advice.

542
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:32,667
You probably got nothing much
from your ten years of investigation.

543
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,293
And that's how it will be in the future.

544
00:37:34,418 --> 00:37:35,253
So give up.

545
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:38,547
Why?

546
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,967
Are you scared that I'll find something?

547
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,969
No, it's a hassle.

548
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:45,471
I just don't want to be bothered.

549
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,101
I did that interview
because your life seemed tough,

550
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,477
but that's where I draw the line.

551
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,647
I don't want you anywhere around me
regarding the past.

552
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,650
Just live your life.

553
00:37:58,025 --> 00:37:58,985
That's the best for you.

554
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,702
Isn't this you?

555
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,039
Hwang Taeyong?

556
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:13,457
Hwang…

557
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,046
No, it's not me.

558
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:25,177
Thanks for saying so.

559
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:29,056
Even as I suspected you,
part of me wished it wouldn't be you.

560
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,810
You've made it clear what it is
I need to do.

561
00:38:33,894 --> 00:38:35,021
I'll be off.

562
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,449
That jerk.

563
00:38:48,784 --> 00:38:49,785
Juhee.

564
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:52,997
All right, that's me in the picture.

565
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,125
But I didn't kill President Na.
Why would I do such a thing?

566
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:57,710
You must know the answer to that.

567
00:38:57,793 --> 00:39:01,756
-What I know is that I will never give up.
-Juhee.

568
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,056
Whatever you do, I'll reveal
the truth behind my dad's death.

569
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,225
And I will make you pay.

570
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,228
Until then, enjoy living your life.

571
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,206
Seungcheon?

572
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:38,000
Juhee.

573
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,212
I came to drink beer with you.

574
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:46,175
I have one primary interview
and one final interview coming up.

575
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:48,636
I don't know how it will turn out.

576
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,722
It will go well.

577
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:57,186
I do wish it'll work out this time.

578
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,483
Juhee. Today, with Taeyong…

579
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:05,486
What? What's going on?
I recently changed the lights.

580
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,364
Is the cutout busted? Wait here.

581
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:10,616
Let me check. Do you have an extra lamp?

582
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,742
Yes, I do.

583
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:16,747
This is like back in college. I changed
the lights in your room, remember?

584
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:19,458
You made me clean that lampshade, too.

585
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,045
I don't remember.

586
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,589
I rarely do petty chores, you see.

587
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,806
Then what made you change so much?

588
00:40:38,853 --> 00:40:40,521
Because there's nothing else...

589
00:40:42,106 --> 00:40:43,566
...I can do for you.

590
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,957
There are a lot of things
I want to do for you.

591
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,251
If I could, I'd do anything for you.

592
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,922
But this is the only thing

593
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:08,799
I can do for you.

594
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:11,760
At least for now.

595
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,321
Juhee.

596
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:35,618
I still like you.

597
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,289
Actually, I never stopped liking you.

598
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:43,918
For several reasons,

599
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,755
I hid my feelings
and acted like we were friends.

600
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,427
But I still like you.

601
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,180
There has never been a moment

602
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,724
I didn't like you.

603
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:08,484
Seungcheon.

604
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:11,570
You see, I…

605
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:13,781
Not now. Later.

606
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:15,824
Later when I get a job,

607
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,370
tell me then.

608
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:24,291
I'll dress up in a cool suit
with an employee ID around my neck

609
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:27,795
and express my feelings for you again.

610
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,427
I'd like to hear your answer then.

611
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,520
That was such a pathetic way
to express your feelings.

612
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,982
No, Seungcheon.

613
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,568
You did a good job.

614
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:52,945
Darn it.

615
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:19,722
Can't he see me?

616
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,267
Oh.

617
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,644
-Goodbye, thank you.
-Bye.

618
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,688
-We'll see you tomorrow.
-Go on in.

619
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:29,106
Goodbye.

620
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:37,323
I asked them
what kind of food they liked or craved.

621
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,242
They said they liked everything
such as raw fish and buffet food,

622
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,201
and especially money.

623
00:43:41,285 --> 00:43:44,288
But they never take money for free.
They're so weird.

624
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,707
That must be why they're poor.

625
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,086
Good job.

626
00:43:51,503 --> 00:43:54,214
Still, they're lucky to have you
as their son's friend.

627
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:57,926
Take care on your way.

628
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:07,394
SUCCESS AFTER SUCCESS
SIDE DISH STORE

629
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,069
-Good work today.
-Good work.

630
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:21,992
-Honey.
-Yeah?

631
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,286
When Mr. Ahn asked us

632
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,748
what we craved the most,
I thought of one thing.

633
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,707
What is it?

634
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:32,086
Actually, I crave gopchang.

635
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:37,424
You worked at a gopchang place for years.
Aren't you even sick of it?

636
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,176
I was.

637
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,261
Every day I was cleaning,
grilling, and boiling them.

638
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:42,971
I was sick of them.

639
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:45,724
But come to think of it,

640
00:44:45,808 --> 00:44:49,269
I'd never enjoyed it as a customer myself.

641
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:51,939
Honey.

642
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,192
Let's go have it right now.

643
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:57,611
Jeez, I'm just saying.

644
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,280
Let's go home. I'll make dinner
with the pork hind leg at home.

645
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,907
It's a waste of money!

646
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:03,450
Gopchang is expensive.

647
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,620
What do you mean, a waste of money?
It doesn't cost much.

648
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:08,580
Come on. I have money. I can pay for it.

649
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,998
My goodness.

650
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,459
-Let's just go.
-No.

651
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,129
What's wrong with you?

652
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,091
It doesn't even cost much.

653
00:45:27,641 --> 00:45:30,060
DOSIN HIGHTECH DECIDES
TO GO WITH A PHYSICAL DIVISION

654
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,108
How interesting.

655
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:40,529
Please make way.

656
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,197
Is it true about the physical division?

657
00:45:42,281 --> 00:45:43,949
Won't it cause harm to the shareholders?

658
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,285
-Any preparations for a crash?
-Please answer us.

659
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:48,662
As the CEO of Dosin Hightech,
I won't do anything

660
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:51,457
that could damage shareholder value
including a physical division.

661
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:54,835
Rather, for the protection
of shareholder rights,

662
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,423
we're planning to repurchase
treasury stocks. That's all.

663
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,091
-Are you promising that?
-Please make way.

664
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,468
-Mr. Hwang!
-Let us through!

665
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:07,848
Is it okay to say what you haven't
discussed with the president?

666
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,809
The shareholders might like the idea, but…

667
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,604
It wasn't to please the shareholders.

668
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,899
A spin-off is more beneficial to me.

669
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:21,862
And this is my company. I make the call.

670
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:23,697
Not my father.

671
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,912
Don't worry, and just do
what I requested earlier.

672
00:46:29,995 --> 00:46:30,829
Yes, sir.

673
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:42,758
Aren't you busy?
What brings you to my office?

674
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:46,136
I heard about your interview with Juhee.

675
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:47,763
Call it off right now.

676
00:46:48,931 --> 00:46:51,767
I already agreed to it,
and I have no reason to call it off.

677
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,186
Don't you know what she's after?

678
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:56,563
She only cares about her dad's death.

679
00:46:56,647 --> 00:46:58,357
I know. That's why I agreed to it.

680
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,317
I need to know what she's thinking.

681
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:03,028
Or maybe you'd do anything
just to be with her.

682
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:05,906
Seungcheon.

683
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:08,617
I have your golden spoon.

684
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:13,580
If you don't want to regret it later,
you'd better stop this right now.

685
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,677
Regret it?

686
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:29,263
"THERE WON'T BE A PHYSICAL DIVISION"
SHAREHOLDERS WELCOME CEO HWANG

687
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,431
There won't be a physical division?

688
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,520
Tell Taeyong...

689
00:47:38,146 --> 00:47:39,565
to come to my office immediately.

690
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,066
I've already contacted him,

691
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,236
but he says
he has an important appointment today.

692
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,447
An important appointment?

693
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:48,490
Yes, sir.

694
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:55,163
What? This guy is your friend, Mr. Hwang?

695
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:56,874
Do you know Seungcheon?

696
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,166
Of course I do.

697
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:00,335
I wanted to help him make money,

698
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,337
and he hated chicken feed.

699
00:48:02,671 --> 00:48:06,133
So, did you take care
of the 500 million won?

700
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:09,803
You didn't lend me the money,
so don't ask.

701
00:48:10,762 --> 00:48:13,223
Hey, Hwang Taeyong.
Are we just going to stand here?

702
00:48:13,932 --> 00:48:16,560
Ah. Sir, do you remember what I requested?

703
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:18,437
Yes.

704
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,742
A guy who never attracts money

705
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,536
is friends with a guy
who always attracts money?

706
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,831
This is amusing.

707
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,753
How do you know Alex Boo?

708
00:48:43,086 --> 00:48:44,296
What's that about 500 million?

709
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,174
It's none of your business.

710
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:49,676
Why did you want to see me?

711
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,640
Start working here from next week.

712
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:01,438
It's small, but one of the best.
The pay's not bad either.

713
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:06,610
Life must be so easy for you rich people.

714
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:07,569
Forget it.

715
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:10,280
It's already enough
that you helped me with the hotel suit.

716
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:15,953
Just work here.
What's wrong with you and your parents?

717
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,621
And what is wrong with you?

718
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,832
Why are you and Oh Yeojin
dying to do stuff for us?

719
00:49:21,041 --> 00:49:22,042
Oh Yeojin?

720
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:24,753
I don't know about her,

721
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:27,214
but I wronged you in many ways
when I was immature.

722
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:32,469
It must be your sister and parents.

723
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,013
I invited them for dinner
as a token of apology.

724
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,057
Come in.

725
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:42,771
Father.

726
00:49:43,355 --> 00:49:46,400
I came to meet Mr. Boo
and heard you were with a friend.

727
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,235
I guess that friend was...

728
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:51,655
Lee Seungcheon.

729
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:58,954
Why does Taeyong want
to treat us to dinner?

730
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,498
I'm not sure.

731
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,460
Did Seungcheon perhaps tell him
that today's our wedding anniversary?

732
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,004
I doubt it.

733
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:10,966
Even if he did,
why would Taeyong treat us for it?

734
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,551
-Right.
-Hold on.

735
00:50:14,052 --> 00:50:16,638
Taeyong's buying dinner, right?

736
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:20,475
You know, he didn't use up
the salon's pass fee from ten years ago.

737
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,227
He wouldn't make me pay today, right?

738
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:25,397
I forgot about that pass fee.

739
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:28,316
I'll make sure to let him know.

740
00:50:29,234 --> 00:50:31,445
-Darn, I shouldn't have said that.
-Please come inside.

741
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:40,245
My gosh. Hwang Hyeondo is here.

742
00:50:40,912 --> 00:50:42,664
Long time no see.

743
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:44,207
Hello.

744
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,474
I put special effort into the dinner
because Mr. Hwang said

745
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,768
-he was treating his friend's parents.
-I see.

746
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,900
Today's main dish is grilled gopchang

747
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:12,360
specially ordered by Mr. Hwang.

748
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,904
Gopchang…

749
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:19,034
Didn't you say Seungcheon's mother
used to work at a gopchang place?

750
00:51:19,159 --> 00:51:21,912
I think it's a little rude
to have ordered this on purpose.

751
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,834
Then should I serve something else?

752
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,170
No, I'm all right.

753
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:33,715
I did work at a gopchang place
for a long time,

754
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,510
but I'd never had it as a customer.

755
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,179
So to be served with some,

756
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:40,639
it's very nice.

757
00:51:42,349 --> 00:51:43,892
That's a relief.

758
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:48,355
All right, then. Please enjoy.

759
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:51,024
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

760
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:00,200
What a strange atmosphere.

761
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:06,289
That Taeyong was
this considerate of you, ma'am,

762
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:08,166
it's surprising.

763
00:52:08,250 --> 00:52:09,501
-Let's eat.
-Sure.

764
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,795
Thank you for the food, sir.

765
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,757
Mm.

766
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,022
Taeyong, do you also have soup first
when you have a meal?

767
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,566
That's interesting.

768
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,193
-Mom, look how both picked out the chili.
-What?

769
00:52:35,277 --> 00:52:37,445
-He's just like dad.
-You're right.

770
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,409
Others might think Taeyong's my son, sir.

771
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:49,040
I remember hearing
that you were a webtoon artist.

772
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,917
That was a long time ago.

773
00:52:51,001 --> 00:52:53,545
Right now, I'm running a side dish store.

774
00:52:53,628 --> 00:52:56,464
A side dish store, I see.
That's admirable.

775
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,552
It must have been hard
to raise your kids by selling side dishes.

776
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,596
May I ask where you live?

777
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:06,391
We live in a small semi-basement apartment
next to the store.

778
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,936
I've worked hard in life,
but I'm not so talented at making money.

779
00:53:11,938 --> 00:53:13,190
I'm not sure about that.

780
00:53:13,273 --> 00:53:17,611
I believe money is earned
through hard work, not talent.

781
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:21,281
If you give all your might,
it's impossible

782
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,033
not to make money.

783
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,287
-Father.
-You couldn't make money?

784
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:31,291
That means you weren't desperate enough.

785
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:32,584
Or incompetent.

786
00:53:34,628 --> 00:53:37,964
Did you just say my father is incompetent?

787
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,382
That's not what I meant.

788
00:53:39,466 --> 00:53:42,135
Let me apologize if that's how it sounded.

789
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:47,224
That company is one
of our cooperative firms.

790
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,101
I guess Taeyong introduced it to you.
Will you work there?

791
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,603
No, I won't.

792
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:54,856
I don't want to get employed unfairly
by trampling on others.

793
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,362
That's what incompetent
and weak people say.

794
00:54:00,445 --> 00:54:01,988
If you're truly desperate,

795
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,491
you just have to prove yourself there.

796
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,034
But because you have no confidence,

797
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:08,245
you're hiding behind that excuse.

798
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:09,704
Are you kidding me?

799
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,122
What…

800
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,875
How rude of you!

801
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:16,211
Honey.

802
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,129
I apologize, sir.

803
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:22,008
Your words...

804
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,469
are all correct.

805
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,847
And I understand your concern.

806
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,726
You're unhappy with Taeyong being close

807
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:34,020
to my son, aren't you?

808
00:54:34,729 --> 00:54:37,857
I do understand why you're displeased
to see your son

809
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:39,359
associate with poor people like us.

810
00:54:39,442 --> 00:54:42,070
Of course, I understand.

811
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,530
But sir,

812
00:54:44,781 --> 00:54:46,408
poverty is…

813
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,790
It's not contagious.

814
00:54:55,667 --> 00:54:57,460
It's true that I'm incompetent and weak.

815
00:54:57,544 --> 00:54:59,546
But Seungcheon isn't.

816
00:55:00,046 --> 00:55:02,924
I'm really proud of my son.

817
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,136
Just as I trust my son,

818
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:09,973
why don't you trust your son?

819
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:12,767
Right.

820
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:21,860
I'm really sorry to interrupt,

821
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:26,072
but Taeyong prepared
this dinner with care.

822
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,866
Shouldn't we enjoy it while it's warm?

823
00:55:29,451 --> 00:55:31,453
-Yes.
-Eat up now.

824
00:55:33,663 --> 00:55:35,874
Taeyong, thank you.

825
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:37,917
I'll enjoy it.

826
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,504
-This is to die for.
-Yes.

827
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,591
Knock it off.

828
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,843
But I'm annoyed!

829
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,887
How could you just laugh it off there?

830
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:51,473
Then what else could I have done?

831
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,436
I'm so hungry after that expensive
and terrible dinner.

832
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,689
-Mom.
-What?

833
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:01,191
Do we have some young radish kimchi?

834
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,234
-You want bibimbap?
-Yes.

835
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,612
Me too. That sounds so good.

836
00:56:05,987 --> 00:56:06,821
Jeez.

837
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:09,491
-Here's the kimchi.
-Yes, the kimchi.

838
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,202
-This is it.
-This is it.

839
00:56:12,285 --> 00:56:14,871
-This is it.
-This is it.

840
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,374
-Mom.
-What?

841
00:56:17,457 --> 00:56:18,458
Dad.

842
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:21,544
Thank you for saying that you trust me

843
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,297
-and that you're proud of me.
-Mm.

844
00:56:26,758 --> 00:56:29,260
-Goodness, hey.
-Oh, my!

845
00:56:29,969 --> 00:56:33,598
I'm proud to be your son too.

846
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:39,771
-Why don't you just film a movie?
-Goodness.

847
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:41,648
-Right, honey.
-Yeah?

848
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,525
You have something for Seungcheon.

849
00:56:46,194 --> 00:56:47,195
Seungcheon, take a seat.

850
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,114
-What?
-You too, honey.

851
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,034
Seungcheon.

852
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:57,247
I once told you that I didn't want you
to draw for a living, remember?

853
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:02,961
I'm sorry. Life was hard for me back then.

854
00:57:05,797 --> 00:57:07,799
Now that I look back on it,

855
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:10,427
having a dream itself is bliss.

856
00:57:11,010 --> 00:57:13,138
Seungcheon, start drawing again.

857
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,973
Your mom and I will help you.

858
00:57:19,477 --> 00:57:20,603
Dad.

859
00:57:21,896 --> 00:57:22,897
Mom.

860
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,287
Hey, are you eating alone?

861
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,955
-This is expensive.
-It's mine.

862
00:57:39,038 --> 00:57:41,082
The kimchi is awesome.

863
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,967
Today wasn't a coincidence, was it?

864
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,096
You knew everything
and came on purpose, didn't you?

865
00:57:57,015 --> 00:57:57,849
That's right.

866
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,186
I wondered what kind of people they were

867
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:04,272
that you put work aside
and went to meet them.

868
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:06,774
So I went there to check.

869
00:58:06,858 --> 00:58:08,234
How were they?

870
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,029
Like you said, they are
incompetent and weak.

871
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,238
But…

872
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:16,159
But you have everything.
Did you have to be that cruel?

873
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,453
They have nothing.

874
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,539
-They're nobodies!
-Quiet.

875
00:58:30,381 --> 00:58:31,216
Do you know...

876
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:37,472
the actual reason
I sent you to the States?

877
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,645
That petty sense of pity.

878
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:46,022
I sent you there to get rid of it.

879
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:49,359
Being abandoned like an orphan

880
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:52,779
so that you could survive solely
on your own without trusting anyone.

881
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:54,239
That's why I sent you.

882
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,740
Those who survived life that way

883
00:58:55,823 --> 00:58:58,034
know that money, power, and desire

884
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,869
are not for sharing!

885
00:58:59,953 --> 00:59:01,621
If you don't want to have Dosin,

886
00:59:01,704 --> 00:59:04,582
you may live for charity
as you please just like now.

887
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:07,168
But if you want Dosin,

888
00:59:08,086 --> 00:59:09,754
if you want to own it.

889
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,007
Do not provoke me

890
00:59:14,509 --> 00:59:16,052
and remember…

891
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:20,265
what I just said.

892
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,402
I just can't understand.

893
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:39,284
Why do you care about them so much?

894
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:44,539
I'm envious.

895
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:47,750
I'm so envious

896
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:51,462
of Lee Seungcheon who has a mom,
an older sister, and a dad who trusts him.

897
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:54,257
If I said so,

898
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,012
would you understand?

899
01:00:15,903 --> 01:00:19,449
I guess it was difficult for him
to grow up without a mom.

900
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:22,619
If Miyeon heard him, she'd be heartbroken.

901
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:27,957
I'll do better.

902
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:32,462
Why are you being so kind?
This is not like you.

903
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:39,385
In case I tell Juntae

904
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,680
that you are his mother?

905
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:45,683
Don't worry. I'm not that cruel.

906
01:00:45,767 --> 01:00:46,726
Honey.

907
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,315
Why aren't you asking me
who his father is?

908
01:00:57,779 --> 01:01:01,199
You've been with more than just a few men.

909
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,076
I'm not interested.

910
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,506
Fine.

911
01:01:20,051 --> 01:01:21,427
It's better you don't know.

912
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:29,852
Ms. Na, I'm seeing you in a new light.

913
01:01:29,936 --> 01:01:32,188
How did you get us
to interview Mr. Hwang in his house?

914
01:01:32,271 --> 01:01:34,023
This will attract so many viewers!

915
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:36,192
Why don't you just film a reality show?

916
01:01:36,275 --> 01:01:39,153
With a preview, "Hwang Taeyong
reveals his house for the first time!"

917
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:41,155
I really wish I could do that.

918
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,785
Mr. Hwang, hello.

919
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:49,330
-Goodness, he's hopeless.
-Hello.

920
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:50,456
Is everything ready?

921
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,792
Yes, everything's set. Gosh, your house--

922
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:54,001
Let's get started right away.

923
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:56,504
Right now? Sure, let's do that.

924
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:10,810
PARK JANGGUN

925
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:20,737
I got these from a staff member.

926
01:02:20,820 --> 01:02:22,405
They're filming at his place today.

927
01:02:24,866 --> 01:02:26,242
You didn't listen to me?

928
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:29,620
Fine, if this is how you'll behave…

929
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,623
Well…

930
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:35,835
Outside the fence called Dosin,

931
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:38,129
I wanted to prove my competency
solely on my own.

932
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,923
-I see.
-I probably wanted to escape

933
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:42,717
from being Dosin's Hwang Taeyong.

934
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,218
I see.

935
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,262
It must have been hard to get investments.

936
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:49,766
Now, why don't you tell us
how you incubated Most Lab first?

937
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:52,935
I started the business in 2019.

938
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:55,605
What motivated me was in 2016

939
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:58,858
when I studied business
at Stanford graduate school.

940
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,110
Most people there

941
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:04,822
don't think of getting a job
after graduation.

942
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,741
They naturally think
of starting a business…

943
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,356
YOU CAN DO IT, MY SON!

944
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:47,657
Having a dream itself is bliss.

945
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:49,909
Seungcheon, start drawing again.

946
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:52,912
Your mom and I will help you.

947
01:03:55,039 --> 01:03:56,249
Thank you, Dad.

948
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:00,378
But…

949
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:05,758
drawing is no longer my dream.

950
01:04:43,796 --> 01:04:44,755
Dad.

951
01:04:48,509 --> 01:04:50,177
I just want to make money.

952
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,181
I will become rich...

953
01:04:57,643 --> 01:04:58,811
like Hwang Taeyong.

954
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,490
OH YEOJIN

955
01:05:52,782 --> 01:05:54,992
Why would he keep this in a safe?

What were you looking for
secretly in my room?

966
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:01,350
Answer me first.

967
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:03,561
What's all that in there?

968
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,064
And why do you have this?

969
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:10,026
I gave this to Seungcheon.
Why do you have it?

01:07:25,916 --> 01:07:26,834
Have a seat.

972
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:33,382
I thought you'd arrive soon
so I ordered the food in advance.

973
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:37,887
Here.

974
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:51,442
Let's eat.

975
01:07:55,029 --> 01:07:58,491
If another person eats
with this golden spoon,

976
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:02,661
they will gain the memory of its owner.

977
01:08:53,170 --> 01:08:54,672
You had a golden spoon, didn't you?

978
01:08:54,755 --> 01:08:57,800
Guess who will be most shocked
if they find out about what you did.

979
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:58,968
You're going to lose everything.

980
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:02,429
If you are the culprit, I will kill you.

981
01:09:02,513 --> 01:09:05,516
Mr. Smile… That's Seo Juntae's nickname.

982
01:09:05,599 --> 01:09:08,561
Seo Juntae definitely met
with President Na that day.

983
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,855
Lee Seungcheon has changed.

984
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,523
Wait!

985
01:09:12,606 --> 01:09:14,817
You're being punished
for what you did to me yesterday.

986
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:17,820
Can this really swap my parents?
