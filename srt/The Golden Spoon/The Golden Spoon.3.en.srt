1
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:33,950
Taeyong.

2
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,413
-Hey, that's…
-I never liked him.

3
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,541
-Let's just kill him off.
-Hey!

4
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,585
-That's not right.
-Why not?

5
00:00:44,044 --> 00:00:45,879
You don't want anyone
dying under your roof?

6
00:00:45,962 --> 00:00:47,047
Your dad can't handle that?

7
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,798
Taeyong, what's wrong with you?

8
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:52,218
Why did you torture him so much
if you couldn't handle the outcome?

9
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,804
In that case, you should pay.

10
00:00:54,888 --> 00:00:56,347
Taeyong!

11
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,600
Spare me. I won't do it anymore.

12
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,144
Just this once. I won't do it anymore!

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,188
Just this once.

14
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,273
Should I spare you?

15
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,155
But that would be no fun.

16
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,491
Janggun.

17
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,534
I'm not like you.

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:21,664
I'm Hwang Taeyong.

19
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,501
Hwang Taeyong, please…

20
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,889
EPISODE 3

21
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,773
Don't worry and just do as I say.

22
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,608
I can handle it all.

23
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,827
BASED ON THE NAVER WEBTOON
THE GOLDEN SPOON BY HD3

24
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:00,620
Because I'm Hwang Taeyong.

25
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,758
He's in a director's meeting,
but he will be back soon.

26
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:14,801
I'll be excused then.

27
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:16,469
Thank you.

28
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:49,043
PRESIDENT HWANG HYEONDO

29
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,884
HWANG HYEONDO

30
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,917
DOSIN GROUP PRESIDENT HWANG HYEONDO

31
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:34,214
President Hwang Hyeondo.

32
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,175
President Lee Seungcheon.

33
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,094
Ah. That's not right.

34
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,725
President Hwang Taeyong.

35
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:49,771
All this is mine.

36
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:53,399
It's going to be mine.

37
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,412
WRITTEN WILL AND TESTAMENT

38
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,747
A written will?

39
00:04:08,957 --> 00:04:10,959
NOTARIAL DEED OF WILL
LEGATEE'S NAME: HWANG HYEONDO

40
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,711
EXECUTOR'S NAME: KIM HYUNWOO

41
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,256
TESTATOR: HWANG HYEONDO
WITNESSES: KIM KYUTAE, LEE WOOHYUK

42
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:21,761
I, Hwang Hyeondo, do not leave

43
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:24,347
any of my assets to my heir,
Hwang Taeyong.

44
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,308
What is this?
Why won't he leave anything to his son?

45
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,643
It makes no sense.

46
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,353
The young master is waiting inside.

47
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:31,437
Is he?

48
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:43,908
-Hello, Father.
-Hello.

49
00:04:48,246 --> 00:04:50,206
What brings you here, all of a sudden?

50
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,083
I have something to tell you.

51
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:54,544
I caused a problem.

52
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,505
A problem? What kind of problem?

53
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,843
That would be Park Janggun's father.

54
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,430
CHIEF OF STAFF, PARK KIJU

55
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:08,516
You just have to tell him that
you've left everything to my discretion.

56
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,518
I'll take care of it.

57
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:16,399
Hwang Hyeondo, speaking.

58
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,235
I see.

59
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,321
Taeyong will take good care of it himself.

60
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,490
Of course. I trust my son.

61
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,576
Sure, goodbye.

62
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,414
Are you happy now?

63
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:36,210
Thank you, Father,
for saying that you trust me.

64
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,838
You said you'd take care of it.
Run along, then.

65
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:53,144
By the way, Father,

66
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,606
do you actually love me?

67
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,109
Of course. I do love you.

68
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,757
So what if President Hwang
owns a conglomerate?

69
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,884
What can Taeyong possibly do
to take care of this?

70
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,470
And why did you hang up
without getting in a single word?

71
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,890
Calm down. President Hwang
probably has something in mind.

72
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,644
I'll make his son pay
for what he did to my son.

73
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,646
Where is Taeyong right now?

74
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,648
Where is he?

75
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:44,654
You're both here.

76
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,073
Janggun, how are you feeling?

77
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:50,952
Now you show up.
How could you shoot our son?

78
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:51,953
You're a monster!

79
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:54,580
I never shot him.

80
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,749
Hwang Taeyong, please…

81
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:03,589
And it was a blank shot.

82
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,882
A blank shot?

83
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,969
Even so, you shouldn't have done
something so dangerous!

84
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:12,223
I agree. Janggun, why did you do it?

85
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:14,517
You called Lee Seungcheon over
whenever you were bored

86
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,145
shot blanks at him, beat him up,
harassed him, and threatened him.

87
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:18,146
You remember, right?

88
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:20,815
Is what Taeyong said true?

89
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:24,360
No, Dad. I didn't--

90
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,947
I thought he deserved to experience
the fear that Seungcheon felt.

91
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:32,785
Also, you know it's illegal to possess
a hunting gun and live ammunition, right?

92
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:37,165
I bet you do. You're the Chief of Staff.

93
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:42,253
Don't worry. None of us wants
to make a big issue out of it.

94
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,673
Janggun.

95
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:49,093
How do you like our hospital's VIP room?

96
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,636
Stay as long as you want.

97
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,015
I'll be off, then.

98
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:57,727
Don't be a crybaby.

99
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:02,607
Oh, no.

100
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,527
Yes, Attorney Go. I don't think
you need to come over.

101
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:08,696
Yes.

102
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:14,202
I thought it was strange
when he asked for a blank shot.

103
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,287
But why? This wasn't like him.

104
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,927
Are you okay?

105
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,055
Our young master really saved you today.

106
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:41,646
You bite your nails like him.

107
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,650
Let's go.

108
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,401
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:55,868
Get in. I'll take you to your house.

110
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:09,090
Hey.

111
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,801
Why did you help me?

112
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,264
Because I was sorry.

113
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,267
I was sorry that you got beaten up
on my behalf.

114
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,602
What do you mean by that?

115
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,820
Let's just say that I settled my debt.

116
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,532
I paid what I owed you.

117
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,672
I'm so sorry I'm late.

118
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:53,134
-Your visit to the columbarium went well?
-Yes.

119
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:54,927
Let me do the rest.

120
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:57,972
I feel bad for your friend.
At such an early age…

121
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,685
Her parents must be absolutely crushed
to live without their child.

122
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,216
Lee Seungcheon.

123
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,013
Don't tell your parents about Janggun,

124
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,890
or they'll be worried.

125
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,073
Do my words mean nothing to you?

126
00:10:58,449 --> 00:10:59,283
Are you kidding me?

127
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:01,786
I told you to pay
the overdue rent by today.

128
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,665
Take the three months' worth first,
and please wait a bit for this month's.

129
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,084
-I will soon--
-Why must I always

130
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:10,711
cause a scene just to get my money?

131
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,172
I'm sorry. If you'll please wait a little…

132
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:15,633
Seungcheon.

133
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,635
Hey, Seoul Jeil High. I'm glad you came.

134
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,637
Since you're smart, answer me instead.

135
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:21,514
This overdue rent situation.

136
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,557
Isn't it a violation
of my property rights?

137
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:29,146
That rude punk is ignoring me again.
Hey, come here.

138
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,273
He doesn't know much.

139
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:33,651
-Seungcheon, what happened to your face?
-Please calm down.

140
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,194
I got hurt while playing basketball.

141
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:39,073
Mom, tell them
to stop being loud and leave.

142
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,283
-I'm tired.
-What, we're being loud?

143
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:44,537
You little punk. Come over here.

144
00:11:45,371 --> 00:11:46,831
He's still ignoring me!

145
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:48,958
-He doesn't--
-Get off me!

146
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:52,670
I don't want to hear it.
Just move out immediately!

147
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:00,344
Wait.

148
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,525
Sir, please show mercy.

149
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:17,486
Just move out. End of discussion!

150
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,530
The lease expires this month anyway.

151
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,159
If you don't move out, I'll wipe
this place out with the boys. Got it?

152
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,160
Move out.

153
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:29,248
Sir, please.

154
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,459
You can't tell us to move out so suddenly.

155
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,252
Please spare us this once.

156
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,879
-Please.
-Get off me.

157
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,385
Stop making life hard for others,
dwelling on your stupid comics,

158
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,471
and just go out to work!

159
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:45,014
Are you a parasite? A leech?

160
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,599
You piece of trash.

161
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:50,394
Please show mercy.
Show us mercy this once.

162
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,606
Hey, polish my shoe.
I'll give you 10,000 won for it.

163
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,274
Polish it. Do it.

164
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,819
I guess his pride doesn't allow him.

165
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:00,863
Should I go talk to them?

166
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,200
-Polish it. Come on.
-No.

167
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,451
There's no need.

168
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,745
You can't?

169
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,834
Guys, he's polishing it.

170
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,629
Ooh. He's really doing it.

171
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,673
This is the power of 10,000 won.
Look how hard he's going at it.

172
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,761
Very good. Hey, here.

173
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,722
20,000 won for this one here.

174
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,518
Look at him.

175
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:31,644
He's good.

176
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,187
It sure was

177
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,148
a good choice to swap parents.

178
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:40,986
Hey, polish it hard.

179
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:43,614
Their landlord seemed too harsh.

180
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:47,076
Will your friend's family be okay?

181
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,038
What about me? Will I be okay?

182
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:53,165
What do you mean?

183
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,128
Why won't he leave anything to his son?

184
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,588
It makes no sense.

185
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,258
I'd better do something.

186
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,349
DOSIN BIOTECH'S SUBSCRIPTION DEPOSIT
EXCEEDS 10 TRILLION WON

187
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,730
Dosin Biotech has made history
in domestic IPOs.

188
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,315
Despite the stock market slump,

189
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,359
its subscription deposit
exceeded ten trillion won.

190
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,111
The competition rate
of its public offering

191
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,196
is said to be 871 to 1…

192
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,991
President Hwang hit another jackpot.

193
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,579
Why? You don't want to watch it?

194
00:14:32,204 --> 00:14:34,456
You're only enjoying this luxury
thanks to Taeyong.

195
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,794
But what were you guys doing
when you got hurt?

196
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:41,839
What? I told you. We were playing games.

197
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:47,720
Oh Yeojin. You seem
very interested in Taeyong these days.

198
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,054
Do you have a crush on him?

199
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,182
Yes, I'm very much interested in him.

200
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,897
-Because he's someone…
-What…

201
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:01,150
-…I'd love to kill.
-What?

202
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:05,279
-Hey, I was kidding.
-Jeez.

203
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,073
His birthday party is this weekend.
What will you do?

204
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,159
I'm not going. Why would I go there?

205
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,368
I thought you wouldn't.

206
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:14,663
But Park Janggun, you know what?

207
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:18,042
Hwang Taeyong and Lee Seungcheon
have the same birthday.

208
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,420
Isn't that interesting?

209
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:27,509
What a strange coincidence
between those two.

210
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,429
Stop the forced demolition!

211
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:32,681
Respect the evicted residents.

212
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,475
Respect us! Respect us!

213
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:37,061
Reject the forced demolition

214
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,188
that tramples on people's dwellings!

215
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,065
Stop it! Stop it!

216
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,775
This forced demolition is killing people.

217
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,568
Withdraw the hired gangsters!

218
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,946
Withdraw them! Withdraw them!

219
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,656
Stop and withdraw

220
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,449
this reckless joint development!

221
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,868
Stop and withdraw!
Stop and withdraw!

222
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,086
HANMAEUM SERVICE

223
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:03,879
-Hey, Lee.
-Yes?

224
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,715
-Are you sure you're experienced?
-Yes, I am.

225
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,050
You're lying.

226
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:10,970
Just leave. If you get hurt,
it will only be a nuisance.

227
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,597
No, I can do this. I need the money.

228
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,474
I need to make money. I can do it.

229
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,059
Goodness.

230
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,353
Hey, Jeong. We have a newbie.

231
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,855
-Take him with you.
-Stop the forced demolition

232
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:23,524
that tramples on people's dwellings.

233
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,317
Stop it! Stop it!

234
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,196
The person you have called cannot…

235
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:31,615
My husband won't pick up.

236
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:34,368
But he's always at home.
Why won't he pick up?

237
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,829
He draws educational cartoons
at a publisher these days.

238
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,623
That's great.

239
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:41,166
He might make some money then.

240
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:44,712
Then why don't you invest
a little more and get this house?

241
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,714
This is the cheapest deal you'll get.

242
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,341
I'll give it some thought.

243
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,386
Push them all out!

244
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,081
No! Not this.

245
00:17:21,165 --> 00:17:23,125
You can't take this.

246
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,543
-Let go!
-No.

247
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:26,003
Come here!

248
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,094
Goodness.

249
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,222
Lee!

250
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,724
Lee!

251
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:43,562
Lee, pull yourself together!

252
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:07,211

257
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:36,156
Be careful not to get hurt.

258
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,702
Excuse me.

259
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,917
Is she your daughter? How pretty.

260
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:54,007
Try to understand.
His daughter died five years ago.

261
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,259
I'm sorry?

262
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,344
After she died,
he never stayed out of trouble.

263
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,887
He came out of prison a month ago.

264
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,265
He lost his chance to be good to her.

265
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:03,559
It's no use longing for her
when she's dead.

266
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:05,978
Let's go get paid.

267
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:52,566
I've never received
this many birthday gifts before.

268
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,692
Young master.

269
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:04,703
Goodness, it looks great on you.

270
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,747
Thank you, Ms. Gong.

271
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,584
-Young master.
-Munki.

272
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,336
Did you get what I asked?

273
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:14,630
He called me Ms. Gong.

274
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:18,550
He's always called me Ms. Kang.

275
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,260
PUBLIC OFFERING CERTIFICATE
COMPANY: DOSIN BIOTECH

276
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,013
The president will be delighted
when he sees this.

277
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:24,723
How did you come up with this?

278
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,934
I'd like to become
the heir of Dosin Group.

279
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,770
That's only natural.

280
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:33,607
And another thing. President Na Sangguk
arranged this party today.

281
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,776
Please don't forget to thank him later.

282
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,444
Is Juhee coming?

283
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,321
I'm not going.

284
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,908
I'm sorry, Taeyong,
but I can never be there.

285
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,623
Where should I go?

286
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,255
Just go straight this way.

287
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,591
-Pardon?
-You're going to Lee Seungcheon's house.

288
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,638
How did you know?

289
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,515
I have my way of figuring things out.

290
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,809
Let me ask you for a favor.

291
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,479
Among his friends,

292
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,564
there's a boy named Hwang Taeyong, right?

293
00:21:14,648 --> 00:21:15,565
You know him too?

294
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:18,277
Of course, I do.

295
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,696
Deliver this to him.

296
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:24,866
I forgot to tell him something.

297
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:32,332
TO HWANG TAEYONG

298
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,965
Did he really get hurt
while playing basketball?

299
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:44,261
Good morning.

300
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:50,267
What's this smell? I prefer kimchi stew.

301
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:52,853
Today's your birthday,
so I made seaweed soup.

302
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:55,856
Hold on.

303
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:05,699
Happy birthday.

304
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,327
What is this?

305
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:16,710
I don't need it.

306
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,005
You went through a lot giving birth to me.

307
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,757
You deserve the gift.

308
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,676
Here, my gift for you.

309
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,886
Oh!

310
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:28,305
Gosh, stop. You're making me feel dizzy.

311
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:33,769
Strangely, I can't believe
that I have a mom.

312
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,271
So I keep checking at night.

313
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,398
If it's real or a dream.

314
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,527
Mom, I don't need another gift.

315
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,404
You're all I need.

316
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,828
Mom, what's wrong?

317
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,166
I feel so happy.

318
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,045
I thought we had drifted apart
as you grew up.

319
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:05,467
I'm so happy that you're back
to how you used to be.

320
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,348
Seungcheon, can I ask you something?

321
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,307
Yes.

322
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,352
Are you doing okay at school?

323
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,645
Is everything all right?

324
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,773
Don't tell your parents
about Janggun, or they'll be worried.

325
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:24,194
Of course, there's nothing
you should worry about.

326
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:25,612
So don't worry.

327
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,907
Oh, please.

328
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,617
Stop being so melodramatic.

329
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,911
Jeez, where's my birthday gift?

330
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,579
Why you little…

331
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:36,248
Who got you a new phone when you drowned?

332
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,292
All right, I get it.
Why are you so strong?

333
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,345
Hello.

334
00:23:50,929 --> 00:23:52,389
I'm Seungcheon's friend, Na Juhee.

335
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,518
Happy birthday. It's for you.

336
00:23:56,601 --> 00:24:01,314
Had I known you were coming,
I would've prepared some snacks.

337
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,608
It's okay, Mom. Some fruit will do.

338
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,194
-Come in.
-Okay.

339
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:15,036
-Come on in.
-Thank you.

340
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:30,802
My goodness, he invited a friend over.

341
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,596
A girl, at that.

342
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,639
-Goodness.
-Hey, shouldn't you go to work?

343
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,309
-Hurry and leave.
-Okay, I will.

344
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:40,270
Go on.

345
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:52,407
Ooh.

346
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:04,503
Thank you all for coming
despite your busy schedules.

347
00:25:06,296 --> 00:25:08,006
-How cool!
-Go, Taeyong.

348
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,094
Today's my birthday,

349
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,973
but I dedicate this day to the ones
who gave birth to me and raised me.

350
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:18,808
My parents.

351
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:22,854
Ooh.

352
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,609
In that sense, I prepared a small gift
for my father. Is that okay, Father?

353
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:38,662
PUBLIC OFFERING CERTIFICATE
COMPANY: DOSIN BIOTECH

354
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,998
I saved my allowance

355
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,960
and tried out for the public offering
of Dosin Biotech.

356
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,254
Ooh.

357
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,589
I expected more, but I only got 36 shares.

358
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:53,260
I didn't know
your company was this popular.

359
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:02,435
That's cool, Taeyong!

360
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:04,020
The competition rate was 871 to 1.

361
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,482
I prepared this gift
to remember the shareholders

362
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,192
who bet their hopes on your company.

363
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,236
I hope you like it, Father.

364
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,201
Thank you, Taeyong.

365
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:25,584
This is very unusual for a boy
who always dozed off.

366
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,046
Taeyong sure is impressive.

367
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,799
He's more than enough
to be your successor.

368
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:34,426
He has a long way to go.

369
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,345
By the way, I don't see Juhee around.

370
00:26:37,929 --> 00:26:39,556
Is she not coming again?

371
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,933
Of course she's coming.

372
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,351
She's almost here.

373
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:47,731
Before that, my eldest son
wanted to greet you.

374
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:48,773
Excuse me for a moment.

375
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,319
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

376
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,702
Gosh, is Juhee even coming?

377
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:04,914
Dad, if she doesn't make it,
I will not let this slide.

378
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,168
Shut it. You lay a finger on her

379
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,337
and I won't leave a dime to you.

380
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,300
AWARD CERTIFICATE
SUBJECT EXCELLENCE AWARD

381
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:16,968
AWARD CERTIFICATE
PERFECT ATTENDANCE AWARD

382
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,484
Just how I pictured his room to be.

383
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,558
What is this?

384
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,771
That? I tried to follow my dad's drawings.

385
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,904
True Colors of Shaolin.

386
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:21,991
It's considered a legend
in the martial arts comic world.

387
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:25,912
That's a surprise.
I thought your only interest was studying.

388
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,749
Ah. Thanks for the gift, Juhee.

389
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,630
Get me one more while you're at it.

390
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:39,008
Help me with the Korean language
assignment.

391
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,094
What?

392
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:43,722
Why? You don't want anyone
to freeload off of your work?

393
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:46,516
Uh, no, that's not it.

394
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,269
He didn't seem like a freeloader type.

395
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:58,194
-Seungcheon! Seungcheon! Seungcheon!
-What?

396
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,698
-Seungcheon.
-Juhee.

397
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,742
Juhee, I can't catch that.

398
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,870
-You do it.
-Me? I can't!

399
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,121
-Juhee, you…
-Hey.

400
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,085
Juhee.

401
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,045
Seungcheon.

402
00:29:40,987 --> 00:29:42,197
Nice.

403
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,497
DAD

404
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,085
DAD

405
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,256
Dad.

406
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:02,842
I said I wasn't going.

407
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:05,887
Why would I go
to Hwang Taeyong's birthday party?

408
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:08,765
Happy birthday, Taeyong.

409
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,184
My father has told me a lot
about you, Mr. Kim Jinyup.

410
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,019
-It's nice to see you.
-Thank you for coming.

411
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:16,564
I loved your surprise.
You seem a little different today.

412
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,025
Thank you, Ms. Oh. Is your son doing well?

413
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:20,360
Yes, thank you.

414
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:21,653
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

415
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:25,198
Taeyong, happy birthday.
You remember me, right?

416
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,700
Of course, I do.

417
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:31,788
You're CEO Kim Injun of Iljin Corporation.

418
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:33,665
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

419
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:42,257
KIM INJUN

420
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,716
CEO OF ILJIN CORPORATION

421
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,845
Taeyong.

422
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:53,768
PARK HWASUNG

423
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:58,022
-Long time no see, Professor Park.
-I love how decent today's party is.

424
00:30:58,398 --> 00:30:59,649
And you look even more decent.

425
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,401
Thank you.

426
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:03,403
-Go greet the others.
-Thank you.

427
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,696
-No problem.
-Shall we?

428
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,662
You seem a little strange today.

429
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,499
You call every guest by their name,

430
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:18,877
and you even prepared a surprise
for your father.

431
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:21,838
I didn't think you were interested
in the company.

432
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,257
I'm starting to.

433
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,843
Anyway, it's unexpected.

434
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:29,304
The fact that you invited those dregs…

435
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:32,181
…and me.

436
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,025
I invited you to apologize.

437
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,694
-What?
-I'm sorry about

438
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,654
being harsh on you at that time.

439
00:31:47,363 --> 00:31:49,699
Oh Yeojin, you don't seem cheap.
You're pretty.

440
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,869
So don't take revenge
like you did back then.

441
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,412
You're better than that.

442
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,927
Hey, that's alcohol.

443
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,720
I know.

444
00:32:11,721 --> 00:32:12,680
Do you want a glass too?

445
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,184
Seungcheon?

446
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,316
It's slightly heavier than Dom Perignon.

447
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:25,860
Not bad.

448
00:32:29,614 --> 00:32:32,325
I came because my father urged me,

449
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,410
but why did you come here?

450
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,413
I have business here too.

451
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:39,207
-You do?
-Yes.

452
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,501
Hey!

453
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:43,503
-Lee Seungcheon, you're here too?
-Seungcheon!

454
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:45,588
Juhee, you came too.

455
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,173
-Hi, Juhee.
-Hi.

456
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:53,096
Hey, Seungcheon. Where are you going?

457
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:57,642
What's with him?

458
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,898
-She's something else.
-Another level.

459
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,824
Taeyong.

460
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,827
-It's all ready.
-For what?

461
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,246
For your piano recital.

462
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,790
The piano?

463
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,043
Why are you so surprised?

464
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,338
You play the same piece every year.
You're going to do it again, right?

465
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:32,719
Everyone, you hear that Taeyong's
piano skills really are phenomenal!

466
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,805
All together, say "Hwang Taeyong."

467
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,350
-Hwang Taeyong.
-Hwang Taeyong.

468
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,729
-Hwang Taeyong.
-Hwang Taeyong.

469
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:46,232
-Hwang Taeyong.
-Hwang Taeyong.

470
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,277
-Hwang Taeyong.
-Hwang Taeyong.

471
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,820
-Hwang Taeyong.
-Hwang Taeyong.

472
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,306
-Isn't that Lee Seungcheon?
-What is he doing?

473
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:17,448
-Go, Lee Seungcheon!
-He's really good.

474
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,826
He plays exactly the same as Taeyong.

475
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:31,379
Nice!

476
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:42,640
Happy birthday, Hwang Taeyong.

477
00:35:42,765 --> 00:35:44,559
That was my birthday gift to you.

478
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:47,353
Consider it repayment
for what you did for me with Janggun.

479
00:35:51,023 --> 00:35:52,567
-Why that little…
-Hey, hey, hey.

480
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,693
Aren't you good at playing the piano too?

481
00:35:53,776 --> 00:35:54,735
No, I'm not.

482
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,571
-Hey, come here.
-What?

483
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:03,619
So our habits and talents
don't get switched.

484
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,252
Hwang Taeyong.

485
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,463
I didn't think you'd make it.

486
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,883
But you came with Lee Seungcheon.

487
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,552
Things turned out that way.

488
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:23,055
Anyway, happy birthday, Taeyong.

489
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,603
Where's my gift?
Don't tell me you came empty-handed.

490
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,772
My dad is throwing this party for you.

491
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,775
That caviar and foie gras
are super expensive.

492
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,194
Make sure you eat them all.

493
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:41,908
Oh, right.

494
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,708
Some old woman asked me
to give this to you.

495
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,461
An old woman? Who?

496
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:56,047
I don't know. I met her
on my way to Seungcheon's house.

497
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,090
She even knew today was your birthday.

498
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,801
Anyway, I did my part.

499
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,367
Where did Seungcheon go?

500
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,625
Guys, have you seen Seungcheon?

501
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:34,543
Seungcheon? He's over…

502
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,546
-He was over there.
-Seungcheon.

503
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,928
Tricked you.

504
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,805
-Hey, where's the sashimi?
-There.

505
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,765
-You'll have another plate, right?
-Yes.

506
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,479
Where did he go?

507
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:00,528
Juhee, where's Hwang Taeyong…
I mean, where's Lee Seungcheon?

508
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,447
-Taeyong.
-Tell me where he is now!

509
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:05,074
I don't know. I'm also looking for him.

510
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,720
I forgot to tell you one rule.

511
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:32,810
If you meet your real parents
on your birthday,

512
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,354
you'll go back
to being your original selves.

513
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:44,322
Thank you for coming today.

514
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:46,449
-Thank you.
-Thank you for inviting us.

515
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,951
-Be careful…
-Goodbye.

516
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:51,996
…so that neither you nor that boy
runs into your real parents.

517
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:04,592
Choices always come with a price.

518
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:09,638
I hope it's not too late
when you get this letter.

519
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:11,432
TO HWANG TAEYONG

520
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,893
I wish you luck.

521
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,439
Hwang Taeyong…

522
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,024
Where the hell is he?

523
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,528
My apologies.

524
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:41,796
So you were here.

525
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,590
Hwang Taeyong was looking for you.
Did you meet him?

526
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,801
Why would he look for me?

527
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:48,052
I'm not sure.

528
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:51,639
You were really cool back there.
When did you learn how to play the piano?

529
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,352
I'm not sure.
I don't remember taking lessons,

530
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:58,687
but I could just do it.

531
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,981
You've never learned how?

532
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,567
That's curious.

533
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,863
Do you have some time?
Come with me for a cup of coffee.

534
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,198
It'll be on me.

535
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,492
Hey…

536
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,002
Hwang Taeyong, where are you?

537
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,639
Taeyong?

538
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,603
Father.

539
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,154
I'm glad I ran into you.

540
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,157
I have someone to introduce you to.
Let's go up together.

541
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,783
Father.

542
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:43,375
What's wrong?

543
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,270
I just wanted to hug you.

544
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,939
It's my birthday and all.

545
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,405
This is not like you.

546
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:19,828
I've never been this grateful
for being born as Hwang Taeyong.

547
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,748
Thank you, Father.

548
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:25,584
All right.

549
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,378
Let's go upstairs.

550
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,952
That was Taeyong's favorite piece.

551
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,498
How did Seungcheon know that?

552
00:43:05,791 --> 00:43:08,168
Help me with the Korean language
assignment.

553
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,130
-What?
-It's slightly heavier than Dom Perignon.

554
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,465
Not bad.

555
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:17,428
Seungcheon did seem unfamiliar today.

556
00:43:21,307 --> 00:43:23,267
Hi, daughter.

557
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:28,230
Do you know how anxious I was
that you might not make it today?

558
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,066
Who's the boy that came with you earlier?

559
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,610
The one who played the piano.

560
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,446
His name is Lee Seungcheon.
We're classmates.

561
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,699
What does his father do?

562
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,160
Why do you always ask me such questions?

563
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:44,622
Is that all you want to know
about my friend?

564
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,832
Then it's obvious.

565
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:50,294
Why do you always hang out with the poor?

566
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:53,672
Not to mention that bratty girl
who stole your watch back then.

567
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,175
Why would you bring up Nara here?

568
00:43:57,134 --> 00:44:01,639
You must hang out with those like you
to avoid problems.

569
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,475
Like attracts like.
Birds of a feather flock together.

570
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:06,810
Do I have to spell these out for you?

571
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,771
Goodness me.

572
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:20,407
He played exactly the same way as Taeyong.

573
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:24,536
It was really intriguing.

574
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,374
Maybe he tried to copy Taeyong.
It's not a big deal.

575
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:33,796
I mean, I'm just bothered
to see him around Taeyong.

576
00:44:33,879 --> 00:44:35,839
Taeyong will deal with him.
Don't be bothered.

577
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:40,052
I wondered what he'd do
when I heard he resold the fund.

578
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,015
His gift sure was a surprise.

579
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,690
Right, I guess you're feeling better now.

580
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:55,776
I was worried when you changed your will,

581
00:44:57,236 --> 00:45:01,281
but no matter how unreliable he is,
Taeyong's your son.

582
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,703
It's only a sheet of paper.

583
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:08,664
I can change it countless times.

584
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:13,585
My successor doesn't have to be my child,

585
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:18,173
but someone who can protect
my money, this group.

586
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,053
But I guess

587
00:45:24,513 --> 00:45:25,514
he's eligible enough.

588
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,658
It's me.

589
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,369
When are you coming back?

590
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,832
You shouldn't be wasting time now.

591
00:45:52,458 --> 00:45:53,834
Come back immediately.

592
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,422
Come back right now if you don't
want to sit back and lose everything!

593
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:06,513
All right.

594
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,557
I'll be waiting.

595
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:20,861
Where is that letter?

596
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,030
I'm sure I put it in my pocket.

597
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:42,966
That old woman

598
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:47,679
wouldn't have another rule
I should be aware of, would she?

599
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,100
I met that old woman here.

600
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:55,938
-Did she say anything else?
-No.

601
00:46:56,897 --> 00:47:00,317
She knew you and Seungcheon.

602
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:02,486
More surprisingly,
she seemed to know me too.

603
00:47:02,569 --> 00:47:03,570
Did you tell her about me?

604
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:06,740
No, but why did you come here?

605
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:09,827
I was on my way to Seungcheon's house.
He invited me to his birthday party.

606
00:47:09,910 --> 00:47:11,036
You went to my house?

607
00:47:13,205 --> 00:47:14,164
Your house?

608
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:16,416
I mean,

609
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:20,754
you went to Lee Seungcheon's house?

610
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,131
Yes.

611
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:25,551
Why did this punk
invite Juhee over to the house?

612
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:36,478
I'll be taking a walk,
so please take your time.

613
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:38,856
Yes.

614
00:47:40,983 --> 00:47:44,903
Why would he have his date
near Lee Seungcheon's house?

615
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,990
Hey, you crazy little…

616
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:49,992
So what if you're the landlord?

617
00:47:50,075 --> 00:47:52,911
I know you stole a peek
through the window!

618
00:47:52,995 --> 00:47:56,832
You shouldn't open someone else's
bathroom window to sneak a look

619
00:47:56,915 --> 00:47:58,792
while they're taking a shower!

620
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:00,836
I wasn't stealing a peek.

621
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:04,214
I heard the water and opened it
to check if you'd moved out.

622
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,466
Stop lying.

623
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:10,053
You pervert!

624
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:11,513
-What?
-What?

625
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,348
What, pervert?

626
00:48:15,350 --> 00:48:16,727
Do you have a death wish?

627
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,438
How dare you call me a pervert?
Do you know who I am?

628
00:48:19,521 --> 00:48:20,606
Whatever!

629
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,441
What… Look at this girl.

630
00:48:22,524 --> 00:48:25,444
This way, that way, backward, and…

631
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:34,328
You little…

632
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,872
You first yanked my hair today.

633
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,249
You're dead meat.

634
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,046
Who are you?

635
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,339
You seem like a good fighter.

636
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,884
Knock it off, or you'll be punished more
than the one who threw the first punch.

637
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:51,678
So you're with them. Is that it?

638
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,682
I got you all.

639
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,980
How did you like
visiting Lee Seungcheon's house?

640
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:06,276
I met his mom and sister,
and they seemed nice.

641
00:49:06,401 --> 00:49:09,905
There were tons of books in his room.
I bet he studies really hard.

642
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:11,740
He's pretty awesome.

643
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:15,619
You have such a positive opinion of him.
There's nothing much to him.

644
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,915
Had he met rich parents like us,
would he have studied that hard?

645
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:22,084
Hey, that's a bit harsh.

646
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:25,754
You've never been
to such a house, have you?

647
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,674
A moldy semi-basement house.

648
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:31,551
There must've been cockroaches too.
Weren't you shocked?

649
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,303
That fool.

650
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,764
Why did he have to invite you over
to that pathetic house--

651
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:37,057
I like him.

652
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:43,855
-What?
-I have feelings for Lee Seungcheon.

653
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,859
So stop insulting him in front of me.

654
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,861
I don't want to hear that from you.

655
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:52,072
Please.

656
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:23,186
What is this?

657
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:28,942
A cake?

658
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,715
Mmm.

659
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,219
Mm?

660
00:51:04,311 --> 00:51:07,272
I'm sorry I couldn't even see you
on your birthday, son.

661
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:08,648
Dad.

662
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,734
I'll work hard to make money

663
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,569
so that you don't have
to struggle so much.

664
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,071
Happy birthday.

665
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,489
But how

666
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,409
is Dad going to make money?

667
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,619
THE SAFEST CITY, BONGJIN CITY

668
00:51:27,709 --> 00:51:30,545
Oh, right.

669
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,841
I did see her taking a shower,
and it wasn't even worth it.

670
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:36,134
I mean it.

671
00:51:38,470 --> 00:51:40,847
Why you perverted piece of…

672
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,432
-What?
-Hey!

673
00:51:43,475 --> 00:51:45,102
-Screw them.
-Let's go.

674
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:47,521
You know you got out easily
because I got hit on his behalf.

675
00:51:50,273 --> 00:51:53,693
Thanks for the help,
but don't be such a busybody.

676
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,445
You get nothing out of meddling

677
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,031
in someone else's business.

678
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:01,368
Is this your way of saying thanks?

679
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:06,331
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

680
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:09,668
-Here.
-What is this?

681
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:13,380
Your hair's straight and too short.

682
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:15,006
Gosh, it's hopeless.

683
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,637
Stop by sometime.
I'll trim your hair nicely.

684
00:52:22,097 --> 00:52:23,265
Happy now?

685
00:52:31,481 --> 00:52:33,024
LEE SUNGAH
SALON DE OBLIGE

686
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:38,196
Lee Seungcheon's older sister.

687
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:41,700
You wouldn't believe
how strong her punches were.

688
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,078
Consider yourself lucky
that it's just a minor scratch.

689
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,499
Have you met her before too?

690
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,963
By the way, they were being forced
to move out. I felt bad for them.

691
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:58,383
That's what I'm concerned about.

692
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,760
I don't think they'll accept my help.

693
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,181
Why would you be concerned
about such a thing?

694
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:07,225
You know I've wronged him in many ways.

695
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:09,186
And his parents.

696
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,690
You've changed a lot lately.

697
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:16,610
Me? How?

698
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,028
Well,

699
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,155
everything in general.

700
00:53:20,238 --> 00:53:22,657
Especially when you
asked me for those blanks.

701
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,284
It really stunned me.

702
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:27,662
Since that incident in the States,

703
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,748
you absolutely hated guns.

704
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,710
But it just put me at ease.

705
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:35,503
You seem to be all over it now.

706
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,177
Of course, it was a long time ago.

707
00:53:54,314 --> 00:53:55,273
Hwang Taeyong,

708
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:58,860
what happened in the States
five years ago?

709
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:15,085
Take one pill a day as always.

710
00:54:36,231 --> 00:54:37,315
What are these?

711
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:39,651
Supplements?

712
00:54:52,205 --> 00:54:54,082
What is this, ma'am?

713
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:56,334
I heard your daughter
was hospitalized again.

714
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,629
It's too bad that she's sick all the time.

715
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,131
I apologize, ma'am.

716
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:02,716
There's no need to apologize.

717
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:07,220
I'm also a mother,
so I understand how you feel.

718
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:13,810
People gossip about me
for being a stepmother,

719
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:17,272
but I consider Taeyong as my own.

720
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:20,525
I know how hard you're trying.

721
00:55:20,608 --> 00:55:23,111
I've seen all your efforts.

722
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,697
With the recent
school violence incident and all,

723
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:30,076
I'm so worried about him these days.

724
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:34,456
Just what is he up to when I'm not around?

725
00:55:37,709 --> 00:55:38,710
Should I

726
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,672
look for someone closemouthed?

727
00:55:46,426 --> 00:55:47,594
Would you?

728
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,224
His name is Ahn Muin.

729
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:56,353
He runs a lease business
with the property his father left to him.

730
00:55:56,436 --> 00:55:57,729
But he's practically a gangster.

731
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,693
What should I do about him?

732
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:16,664
Should I consult with him first?

733
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,423
AHN MUIN

734
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,016
We meet again.

735
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:38,978
This guy seems way younger than you.
What's your relationship with him?

736
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,898
My young master is the one
who inquired about the purchase yesterday.

737
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,859
"Young master?"

738
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:53,618
In this day and age,

739
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:55,370
you have a young master to serve?

740
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,998
All right, Young Master.

741
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:01,918
What is it that you want to purchase?

742
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,254
A studio apartment? A small building?

743
00:57:04,337 --> 00:57:07,132
Renting out a shared office
is quite profitable these days.

744
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:10,051
Unit B02, San-223, Bongjin-dong.

745
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:12,137
Bongjin-dong?

746
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,722
Bongjin-dong…

747
00:57:16,307 --> 00:57:18,518
The semi-basement house?
You want to purchase that?

748
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,186
Why would I buy that rotten building?

749
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:24,232
Jeez, Young Master.

750
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:27,318
You sound pretty rude.

751
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,446
Hey, then why did you come here?

752
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,739
Ahn Muin.

753
00:57:36,327 --> 00:57:37,537
I'm here to teach you a lesson.

754
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,123
You little bastard.

755
00:57:40,206 --> 00:57:41,666
Do you wish to die?

756
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:40,308
GOLDEN REAL ESTATE OFFICE
INVESTMENT CONSULTING SERVICE

757
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:00,453
Why did you have to throw a punch
when we could talk it all out?

758
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:06,084
You'll do as I say, right, Mr. Ahn?

759
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:10,755
Still, that's a little…

760
00:59:13,883 --> 00:59:15,218
INQUIRY REPORT
NAME: AHN MUIN

761
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,428
Tax evasion, bribery, stealing identities,

762
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:18,763
and illegal dealings of apartment lots.

763
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:21,683
A buydown was just the tip of the iceberg.

764
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:23,977
Should we go to the police station first?

765
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,689
I'll be fully at your service,
Young Master.

766
00:59:31,651 --> 00:59:33,111
What are you waiting for?

767
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,530
-At your service, sir!
-At your service, sir!

768
00:59:39,367 --> 00:59:40,243
Let's go.

769
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:57,260
Due to an excessive intake of alcohol
and a serious fatty liver,

770
00:59:57,343 --> 01:00:00,471
I couldn't think reasonably or straight.

771
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,556
The imbalance of my liver…

772
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:04,642
In short, I was too fearless.

773
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:07,312
Well… And?

774
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,814
I'm really sorry for what I did.
Please forgive me!

775
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,774
Forgive me!

776
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,401
What is this crap?

777
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:14,902
It's not crap.

778
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:17,614
I will never raise the rent from now on.

779
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,490
No, even after the lease expires,

780
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:21,951
please keep living here forever and ever.

781
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,244
I beg you!

782
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,579
Please!

783
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,833
What's going on?

784
01:00:34,797 --> 01:00:35,882
Let's go.

785
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,368
I wish I had a friend like you,
Young Master.

786
01:01:07,288 --> 01:01:08,122
Munki.

787
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:10,500
How much would
that apartment building cost?

788
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,920
I'm not sure.
An apartment building in Gangnam…

789
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:17,340
A big one might cost
about two billion won.

790
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:19,425
What about the price
of selling one's conscience?

791
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:22,261
How much of a price must a child pay

792
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:24,597
for selling his own parents?

793
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,059
What are you talking about
all of a sudden?

794
01:01:30,603 --> 01:01:31,854
No, it's nothing.

795
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,567
The price of selling my conscience…

796
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,946
Would two billion won be enough?

797
01:01:48,663 --> 01:01:49,872
Go away.

798
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:02,510
Where are you?

799
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:06,013
Granny.

800
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:12,812
Where are you?

801
01:02:17,024 --> 01:02:23,364
I want the golden spoon again.

802
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:29,912
Where did you go, Granny?

803
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:35,334
Granny!

804
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:40,423
You're in great shape today.

805
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:46,804
Come on, you have to block it!

806
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:48,431
-Nice.
-Nice.

807
01:02:48,806 --> 01:02:49,766
Okay.

808
01:02:50,683 --> 01:02:51,726
I got it!

809
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:56,355
-Juhee, hold tight.
-Okay.

810
01:02:58,065 --> 01:03:00,651
-Out.
-Get out.

811
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,529
-This way, Juhee.
-Hey!

812
01:03:04,280 --> 01:03:06,199
-Nice.
-Good job.

813
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,992
-Let's do it.
-It's two to one.

814
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:09,452
Let's go.

815
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,370
Park Janggun is holding
a grudge against you.

816
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,705
You'd better be careful.

817
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,832
Why are you telling me that?

818
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,125
To draw your attention.

819
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:18,795
Just kidding.

820
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,131
You're still annoying,
but not as much these days.

821
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,633
Here, it's my birthday gift for you.

822
01:03:24,842 --> 01:03:27,720
-You already gave me one.
-The limited-edition basketball shoes?

823
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,764
I didn't even want to get you those.

824
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,974
But this, I do.

825
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,644
It's my favorite.

826
01:03:36,062 --> 01:03:37,063
Catch it!

827
01:03:37,605 --> 01:03:38,981
-Nice.
-Cannonball!

828
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,192
Hey! Pass it here.

829
01:03:41,984 --> 01:03:43,694
-Juhee.
-Okay, this is the last time.

830
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:51,953
Yes!

831
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,290
Darn it.

832
01:04:16,060 --> 01:04:17,019
I like him.

833
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,273
What?

834
01:04:20,356 --> 01:04:22,942
I have feelings for Lee Seungcheon.

835
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,403
Why would you like me?

836
01:04:58,769 --> 01:04:59,812
Bye.

837
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:02,106
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

838
01:05:11,782 --> 01:05:13,784
My Nara's dead,

839
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,787
but you're all smiles.

840
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:04,168
Shut the hell up!

841
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:05,795
You damn brat.

842
01:06:06,045 --> 01:06:07,880
Do you know
how I lived after my daughter died?

843
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,173
Give me money.

844
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:12,134
Your father's rich.
Pay me for my daughter's death!

845
01:06:16,305 --> 01:06:17,974
Munki, go ahead without me. I'll be fine.

846
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:20,643
JUHEE

847
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:22,853
That man felt too suspicious.

848
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:27,984
The person you have called…

849
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,027
Why won't she answer?
Juhee, pick up the phone.

850
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:31,696
JUHEE

851
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,034
Damn you.

852
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:42,456
Juhee, is that you? Juhee.

853
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:44,250
Damn it.

854
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,510
Who are you?

855
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,154
Are you okay?

856
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:15,406
Who is that man? Do you know him?

857
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:55,279
He's the father of my friend, Jeong Nara.

858
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:59,116
Why would your friend's father
do that to you?

859
01:08:03,496 --> 01:08:04,914
Because of this watch.

860
01:08:06,332 --> 01:08:08,084
She stole it.

861
01:08:08,834 --> 01:08:12,546
My dad found out
and forced her to transfer.

862
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:21,472
What is it?

863
01:08:25,601 --> 01:08:28,312
I could've stopped it
since I got my watch back.

864
01:08:29,855 --> 01:08:31,816
But at that time, I hated her too.

865
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:33,818
Let's go.

866
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:41,325
Because this watch
is a keepsake from my mom.

867
01:08:42,576 --> 01:08:43,536
But then,

868
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,331
after a few months,

869
01:08:48,874 --> 01:08:50,709
she suddenly died.

870
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:53,420
It was acute leukemia.

871
01:08:57,091 --> 01:09:00,803
You… My Nara died because of you.

872
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:03,639
She died because of you!

873
01:09:04,682 --> 01:09:07,184
My Nara died because of you!

874
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:10,062
Why?

875
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:11,897
Why?

876
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:15,484
Why?

877
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:21,991
She was so healthy.

878
01:09:24,285 --> 01:09:25,953
How could that happen?

879
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:33,169
It must've been hard.

880
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:45,514
But it wasn't your fault.

881
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,433
So don't blame yourself.

882
01:09:52,104 --> 01:09:54,231
This isn't like you, Hwang Taeyong.

883
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:55,941
What about me?

884
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:59,111
You aren't the type
who can console others.

885
01:10:01,238 --> 01:10:02,448
I'm not?

886
01:10:03,949 --> 01:10:05,784
But I understand you now.

887
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:09,330
That's why you were so good
to Lee Seungcheon.

888
01:10:10,497 --> 01:10:13,375
You feel bad for him
like you did for Nara.

889
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,173
No.

890
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:22,509
I just like him.

891
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:26,096
Seungcheon is Seungcheon.

892
01:10:29,683 --> 01:10:31,644
Thanks for today, Taeyong.

893
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,146
Things could've been really bad
if not for you.

894
01:10:34,271 --> 01:10:35,814
Had you not run into me by accident--

895
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,692
It wasn't an accident.
I went there to see you.

896
01:10:41,487 --> 01:10:45,741
I wanted to ask you something,
but I don't need your answer anymore.

897
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,535
What are you talking about?

898
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,467
What are you doing?

899
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:05,678
There's a mark on your neck.

900
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:07,805
President Na would get worried.

901
01:11:10,307 --> 01:11:13,018
I called the police,
but be careful for the time being.

902
01:11:14,103 --> 01:11:15,813
Let's go. I'll walk you home.

903
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:23,904
He's really strange.

904
01:11:27,533 --> 01:11:29,743
Now that I'm done
with the public offering,

905
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,247
what should I do next
to win President Hwang's favor?

906
01:11:38,002 --> 01:11:39,461
LIST OF DOSIN HIGHTECH SHAREHOLDERS

907
01:11:40,671 --> 01:11:41,714
LIST OF MAJOR SHAREHOLDERS

908
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,925
You sound like
you're talking about a stranger.

909
01:11:50,055 --> 01:11:52,516
You came home early, Father.

910
01:11:53,684 --> 01:11:56,520
What were you doing in my study?
Do you need something?

911
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,526
I heard the shareholders' meeting
will be held next month.

912
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,946
I thought I should study a little
before attending it.

913
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:08,699
You want to attend
the shareholders' meeting?

914
01:12:08,782 --> 01:12:09,950
SHARE TRANSFER AGREEMENT

915
01:12:15,956 --> 01:12:17,124
You saw it, didn't you?

916
01:12:19,376 --> 01:12:20,294
My will.

917
01:12:23,589 --> 01:12:27,092
You saw it the last time
you visited my office, right?

918
01:12:29,136 --> 01:12:30,846
Yes, I did.

919
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:33,432
So that's why.

920
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:37,353
You're trying so hard to win my favor.

921
01:12:37,436 --> 01:12:39,063
Please let me inherit Dosin.

922
01:12:42,024 --> 01:12:45,486
-What?
-Please revise your will.

923
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,571
I'll try my best.

924
01:12:55,662 --> 01:12:56,914
Do you even know…

925
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:04,588
why I decided not to leave anything

926
01:13:05,172 --> 01:13:06,215
to you?

927
01:13:09,510 --> 01:13:13,138
Is it because of what happened
in the States?

928
01:13:15,182 --> 01:13:16,683
It's all in the past.

929
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:19,478
I'm a completely different person

930
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,731
from the past now.

931
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:28,821
Words aren't enough.

932
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,490
Show me proof
that you've changed for real.

933
01:13:59,726 --> 01:14:00,853
The will

934
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:04,231
actually had an effect.

935
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:14,158
Taeyong.

936
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,251
Did anything happen on your way here?

937
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,255
I told you not to worry about me.
Let's go inside.

938
01:14:57,034 --> 01:14:59,077
NEW MESSAGE

939
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,580
I THINK I KNOW.

940
01:15:04,416 --> 01:15:05,709
What is this about?

941
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:07,628
Who is it?

942
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:17,387
TO HWANG TAEYONG

943
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:22,017
TO HWANG TAEYONG

944
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:23,727
Why is this here?

945
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,610
YOU'RE… NOT HWANG TAEYONG, ARE YOU?

946
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,327
I THINK I KNOW.
YOU'RE… NOT HWANG TAEYONG, ARE YOU?

947
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:51,463
AGORA

948
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:52,381
OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU LATER

949
01:16:11,191 --> 01:16:12,609
LET'S GO.

950
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:52,858
I THINK I KNOW.
YOU'RE… NOT HWANG TAEYONG, ARE YOU?

951
01:17:48,872 --> 01:17:50,415
Could this person

952
01:17:50,499 --> 01:17:52,125
have switched parents
with the golden spoon like me?

953
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,586
Why are you going through
others' stuff? It's not like you.

954
01:17:54,670 --> 01:17:57,631
How much does Hwang Taeyong
know about the golden spoon?

955
01:17:57,714 --> 01:17:59,633
You've become quite gutsy, haven't you?

956
01:18:00,217 --> 01:18:02,969
I remember eating at your place
with a golden spoon.

957
01:18:03,053 --> 01:18:03,929
It's my golden spoon.

958
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,973
I don't want my son to be ashamed of me.

959
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:09,851
I'm going to live on as Hwang Taeyong.

960
01:18:09,935 --> 01:18:11,103
Abandon your parents for money?

961
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,063
Only a piece of trash would do that.

962
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:15,607
You're not Oh Yeojin, are you?
