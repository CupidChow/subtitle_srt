1
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,416
I THINK I KNOW.
YOU'RE… NOT HWANG TAEYONG, ARE YOU?

2
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,443
I THINK I KNOW.
YOU'RE… NOT HWANG TAEYONG, ARE YOU?

3
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:27,921
-Is it yours?
-No.

4
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,385
Who turned on their phone?

5
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:39,265
I'm sorry, ma'am.

6
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,525
What was that?

7
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:57,117
Hwang Taeyong, why are you standing?
What's the matter?

8
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:59,661
It's nothing, ma'am.

9
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:14,634
TO HWANG TAEYONG

10
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:37,740
That envelope? I put it there.

11
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,659
-It was you?
-Yeah.

12
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,328
I saw it at your party
and it looked too nice to trash.

13
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,705
But it was empty.

14
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,332
Really? You didn't see what was inside?

15
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:49,586
Are you suspecting me?

16
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:53,590
I don't know how much was in there,
but it wasn't me.

17
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:56,384
Jeez. Is this the treatment
that I get for returning it?

18
00:02:57,552 --> 00:03:00,847
Where are you going? Jeez, he's sulky.

19
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,807
He doesn't know about the letter.

20
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,435
Taeyong, I know Dongkyung well.

21
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,188
He's not the type who'd steal money.

22
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:10,064
His family is pretty well-off.

23
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:13,902
Hey, sulky boy!

24
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,070
Jeez.

25
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,074
EPISODE 4

26
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,410
So I lost the letter.

27
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:24,287
But who sent those texts?

28
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:27,415
Does someone here
know about the golden spoon?

29
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:36,674
Could this person have switched parents
with the golden spoon like me?

30
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,887
Oh Yeojin.

31
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,847
BASED ON THE NAVER WEBTOON
THE GOLDEN SPOON BY HD3

32
00:03:43,389 --> 00:03:44,641
Park Janggun.

33
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:48,353
Jeong Yunsu. Kwon Minho.

34
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:49,562
What do you want?

35
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:53,233
What? Don't be intimidated by him.

36
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:55,526
-Hurry up.
-Whose turn is it?

37
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,529
Lee Dongkyung. Park Jaedon.

38
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:04,661
I doubt it's Na Juhee.

39
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,164
Darn it. Cham, cham, cham!

40
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,792
Hey, be quiet.

41
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,211
Hold on.

42
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,047
Why do I consider Juhee an exception?

43
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,724
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-She sure was strange.

44
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,435
She's too easygoing
to be from a rich family.

45
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,062
How could that happen?

46
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:33,189
Her intense guilt for Jeong Nara's death.

47
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:35,900
Some old woman asked me
to give this to you.

48
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,152
It was also Juhee who gave me the letter.

49
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:49,706
Jeez. Science experiment for a senior?

50
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:53,835
Tell me about it.
The CSAT is just around the corner.

51
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:56,796
-Jeez.
-Jeez.

52
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,486
Wasn't Taeyong odd today?

53
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,822
He was glaring
at Lee Seungcheon pretty hard.

54
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,284
You're right. I wonder why.

55
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,411
I think it's because of you.

56
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,164
-Since you're close with Lee Seungcheon.
-What?

57
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:35,543
Don't tell me
you're flirting with both guys.

58
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:38,921
Yeojin, don't hurt my feelings like that.
That's not me.

59
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,216
Sorry. Then I hope
you won't cross the line from now on.

60
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,302
I've become interested in Hwang Taeyong.

61
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,312
I'm near the science lab.
I'll be there soon.

62
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,647
My phone.

63
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:23,508
3 NEW MESSAGES
DRAW YOUR PATTERN

64
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,781
Hwang Taeyong.

65
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,627
Why are you going through others' stuff?
It's not like you.

66
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,047
Who called you this morning?

67
00:07:03,798 --> 00:07:05,174
Why do you care?

68
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,010
What's wrong?
Is it someone I shouldn't know?

69
00:07:13,182 --> 00:07:15,768
It was my dad. Happy?

70
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,525
I'm sorry, I really am.
I must've gotten the wrong idea.

71
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,322
You can't go like this.
Tell me the reason.

72
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,161
Why are you looking at me like that?

73
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,163
Isn't this cooling?

74
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,081
What? It is.

75
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,588
Come on. What's your problem?

76
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,300
Where's Juhee?

77
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:50,052
Hey, where's Taeyong?

78
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:51,762
I don't see Juhee either.

79
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,307
-Maybe they're together.
-How interesting.

80
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:58,603
What? A prank text?

81
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,439
That's why you searched my backpack?

82
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,568
I'm Hwang Taeyong.

83
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,321
Someone could have been
blackmailing me for money.

84
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,868
Anyway, I shouldn't have searched
your bag. I'm sorry.

85
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,331
A prank text?

86
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:20,875
Is there anyone you suspect?

87
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:34,639
I THINK I KNOW.
YOU'RE… NOT HWANG TAEYONG, ARE YOU?

88
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,432
You're not Hwang Taeyong, are you?

89
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,979
Who sent that cheesy text?

90
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,774
Beats me.

91
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,235
Think long and hard.

92
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,905
Who would want to tease you like that?

93
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,242
It's not me, by the way.

94
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,118
I'd say it to your face.

95
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,747
Hwang Taeyong, I saw you and Juhee
come in late together.

96
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,792
I couldn't care less
whether you studied or not but…

97
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,962
-Juhee.
-Seungcheon.

98
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,840
But you shouldn't drag my Juhee
down as well.

99
00:09:12,093 --> 00:09:13,386
Remember what I said.

100
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,390
"My Juhee"?

101
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:19,684
Let's get some snacks.

102
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,435
I'll let you treat me to some bread.

103
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,146
Hwang Taeyong, join us. It's on me.

104
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,400
Forget it, why would you invite him?
Let's go.

105
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,444
Hwang Taeyong, that little…

106
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,876
Who could it be?

107
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,298
Who would send such texts?

108
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,843
Ms. Gong, a cup of coffee for me.

109
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,067
Taeyong, did you tell your father

110
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:14,071
that you wanted to attend
the shareholders' meeting?

111
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,823
I did.

112
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:18,909
I see.

113
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:24,415
I completely understand
how much you want to please him.

114
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:29,920
But then, shouldn't your priority
be your studies instead?

115
00:10:32,006 --> 00:10:32,840
Right.

116
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:35,801
I'll keep that in mind, Mother.

117
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,222
Please bring me
a cup of coffee to my room.

118
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,065
Ms. Gong, did he just ask for some coffee?

119
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:52,193
Yes, ma'am. He never consumes caffeine.

120
00:10:52,985 --> 00:10:54,111
How odd.

121
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:05,122
JUHEE

122
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:08,167
Hey, Juhee.

123
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:10,878
What?

124
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,636
That's the guy, right?

125
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,846
Yes, it's him.

126
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,808
You won't need to worry anymore
since we caught him.

127
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,810
WRITTEN STATEMENT
NAME: JEONG EUINAM

128
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:29,355
How did you catch him?

129
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,524
He sneaked into his former house.

130
00:11:31,607 --> 00:11:34,944
His excuse was that
he missed his dead daughter.

131
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,570
The house owner's daughter reported him.

132
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:38,739
The house owner's daughter?

133
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,950
-Yes.
-That's Yeojin.

134
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:42,785
Oh Yeojin?

135
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,662
Nara's family rented a room
in Yeojin's house.

136
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,254
REST IN PEACE

137
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:12,815
After a few months, she suddenly died.

138
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:14,608
It was acute leukemia.

139
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,738
She was so healthy.

140
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,866
How could that happen?

141
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,868
Nara's family rented a room
in Yeojin's house.

142
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,622
What if Oh Yeojin is actually Jeong Nara?

143
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:34,170
What if she used
the golden spoon like I did?

144
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,056
Oh Yeojin.

145
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:54,023
This is a surprise.
Why did you call me here?

146
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,901
You told me before
that a girl died because of Na Juhee.

147
00:12:57,943 --> 00:12:59,695
And her name was…

148
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:03,115
What was it again?

149
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,786
-Jeong Nara.
-Right. Jeong Nara.

150
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,538
I heard her ashes are here.

151
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,583
I thought you of all people
would tell me the truth about her.

152
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,543
Why are you curious about Nara?

153
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:19,256
If Juhee really was the reason
why she died, how could I marry her?

154
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:20,633
Don't you think so?

155
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:24,303
So this is about Na Juhee, not Nara.

156
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:25,888
Let's visit Nara first.

157
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,079
I wonder why Taeyong wanted to see Yeojin.

158
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,255
YOU'RE… NOT NA JUHEE, ARE YOU?

159
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,506
What?

160
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:03,717
JEONG NARA

161
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,100
I don't know what Juhee
told you about her,

162
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,560
but I always felt bad for Nara.

163
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,230
I still remember.

164
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,817
On sports day,
we were given bread and drinks.

165
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,944
But she said she was too full.

166
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:26,115
It turns out,
she wanted to give them to her dad.

167
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:29,410
He didn't deserve them.

168
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:34,582
That's all I remember.
We weren't that close either.

169
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,834
I was too ill, so I barely went to school.

170
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:41,338
I see. But that's not what I heard.

171
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:46,385
I heard you and Na Juhee
were the only ones who hung out with her.

172
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:47,303
Most importantly,

173
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:50,306
I heard her family rented
a room in your house.

174
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:56,478
Na Juhee even told you that?
How heartless of her.

175
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,275
It's true. Her family lived in our house.

176
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,612
And Nara was so embarrassed by that
and wanted it to be a secret.

177
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:07,197
She's gone,
but she still deserves respect.

178
00:15:09,658 --> 00:15:12,036
Then why did you report
your close friend's dad?

179
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:16,665
Why did you do that
when he just missed his late daughter?

180
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,963
Because he's a bad person.

181
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,758
He doesn't deserve to be called a dad.

182
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,510
Nara didn't even have her mom.

183
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,513
Do you know how much
her dad hit her and abused her?

184
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,267
I only reported him for Nara's sake.

185
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,604
Is this why you called me here?

186
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,147
How pathetic.

187
00:15:48,113 --> 00:15:49,239
Jeong Nara.

188
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:58,666
You're Jeong Nara, aren't you?

189
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:27,945
NEW MESSAGE
YOU'RE NOT LEE SEUNGCHEON, ARE YOU?

190
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:31,448
What is that?

191
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:41,041
YOU'RE NOT LEE DONGKYUNG, ARE YOU?

192
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,379
YOU'RE NOT PARK JAEDON, ARE YOU?

193
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,798
What did you just say?

194
00:16:56,932 --> 00:17:00,144
You're not Oh Yeojin, are you?

195
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:11,196
Hwang Taeyong, so it was you?

196
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:13,574
What?

197
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,828
I was curious who was behind
such a ridiculous joke.

198
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,039
YOU'RE NOT OH YEOJIN, ARE YOU?

199
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:24,043
Is this funny to you?
Why are you even doing this?

200
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,670
YOU'RE NOT OH YEOJIN, ARE YOU?

201
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,219
Then who is it?

202
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:37,556
Who in the world was it?

203
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,728
It was me. I sent them.

204
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,647
What? Are you a kid or something?

205
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,941
How are you so immature?

206
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:49,818
Why would you send such absurd texts?

207
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,613
You guys have been studying a ton,

208
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:55,365
so I wanted to make you laugh.
Was it not funny?

209
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,286
Jeez, you should just play
mobile games if you're that bored.

210
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:02,164
But whose phone was it?
It wasn't your number.

211
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:03,665
That? It was my mom's.

212
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,794
Had I used my phone,
you would've caught on to it.

213
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,339
Just laugh, will you?
It was just a joke.

214
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,633
Can you quiet down?

215
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:16,095
Can't you see we're all here?
Tone it down.

216
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,347
-Why, that little…
-Hey.

217
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,475
-Hey, sit down.
-Come on.

218
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,434
Sit down.

219
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:25,938
I should be quiet in the classroom.

220
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,400
Lee Seungcheon,

221
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,985
why aren't you using that golden spoon?

222
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,739
A golden spoon? What do you mean?

223
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,909
Look at that. Can't remember?

224
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,620
That's what you said.

225
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:45,290
You said you carried it around
because you were treasured at home.

226
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,543
You said that
at Taeyong's place, remember?

227
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,884
A golden spoon?

228
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,354
I'm quite treasured in my family, you see.

229
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,898
Thanks for the food, Taeyong.

230
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,401
Let's eat.

231
00:19:27,499 --> 00:19:28,417
Right.

232
00:19:31,795 --> 00:19:33,338
I had a golden spoon.

233
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:37,968
Anyway, be quiet. You're too noisy.

234
00:19:39,469 --> 00:19:42,055
-What's with you?
-That little scumbag.

235
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:52,733
Hey, why aren't you eating?

236
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,070
-Mom.
-Yes?

237
00:19:57,154 --> 00:20:00,532
I remember owning a golden spoon.
Where did it go?

238
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,242
What golden spoon?

239
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:04,703
Do you mean the brass spoon
for ancestral rites?

240
00:20:05,704 --> 00:20:09,750
Not that.
I'm certain I had a golden spoon.

241
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,377
Hey, where would our family stash gold?

242
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,213
Mom had one gold ring.

243
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,882
But she sold it
when you started high school.

244
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:20,385
Did you forget that? Jeez.

245
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,221
Right.

246
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,807
Let's eat.

247
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:44,785
It's nowhere.

248
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,288
I'm sure I had it.

249
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:54,878
Once I find it,

250
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,297
I'm going to get mom a gold ring.

251
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:00,092
Darn it.

252
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,053
Hold on.

253
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,891
Did I leave it at Hwang Taeyong's house?

254
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:20,237
How much does Hwang Taeyong know
about the golden spoon?

255
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,379
You have three chances.

256
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,090
After one month, one year,

257
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,718
and ten years.

258
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,805
It's already been almost a month.

259
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:58,942
We have German appliances which
many housewives prefer, built-in ACs,

260
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,069
a spacious pantry…

261
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:04,323
Right. Check that out.

262
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,745
You get a refreshing view of the forest.

263
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,829
It's simply phenomenal.

264
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,289
The subway station is also nearby.

265
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,082
You can see the Han River too.

266
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,460
The air is fresh.
It's such a wonderful house.

267
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:20,839
It's not easy to find
such a house in Seoul.

268
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:21,757
And…

269
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:29,514
Why would our young master be looking
for an apartment all of a sudden?

270
00:22:29,598 --> 00:22:31,725
I know why.

271
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:34,186
He's already preparing
a place for his future second wife.

272
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:56,917
Dad.

273
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,711
What? Hey. You're back.

274
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:00,962
Good work today, my son.

275
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,388
Mm?

276
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,393
Oh!

277
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,438
Seungcheon, look at me.
How do I look today?

278
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:20,482
I'm going on a date.

279
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,881
Honey. What's this delicious smell?

280
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,259
What are we having today?

281
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:48,552
We're having pasta.

282
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:49,928
-Pasta!
-Pasta!

283
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,556
My favorite pasta.
You also made gambas al ajillo.

284
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,350
-Let me have a bite.
-It's hot.

285
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,060
Mmm.

286
00:23:57,144 --> 00:23:58,019
-It's good.
-Is it?

287
00:23:58,103 --> 00:24:00,564
Yes. Try some, Sungah.

288
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:01,481
Ah, mmm.

289
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:03,066
-Right?
-How is it so good?

290
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,277
I'm on a diet.

291
00:24:05,902 --> 00:24:08,363
-It's seasoned so well.
-Gambas.

292
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,032
Seungcheon.

293
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,752
Seungcheon, aren't you going to come back?

294
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:25,547
You should.

295
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,633
Seungcheon, don't you miss your sister?

296
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,843
You'll come back, right?

297
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,156
-No.
-Young Master?

298
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,617
I can just help them as Hwang Taeyong.

299
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,040
-That's enough.
-Young Master.

300
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,085
I'll take it.

301
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,590
All right. This area is stunning as well.

302
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,884
Doesn't it remind you of a park?
Look at that.

303
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,220
They'll plant flowers soon.

304
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,096
Please take a look at this side.

305
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,974
This should be filled with water.
Not at the moment though.

306
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:20,769
You won't regret your decision. This way.

307
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,203
Mm. Thanks. Leave them here.

308
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,709
Ms. Gong, is the guestroom all ready?

309
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,044
Yes, ma'am.

310
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,590
The redecorating has been completed.
We'll bring in the furniture later today.

311
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,385
By the way, is someone coming?

312
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,433
Do you really not know?

313
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,772
Right. I'll get the place ready.

314
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:12,112
Ah.

315
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:32,257
This will look perfect on him.

316
00:26:51,526 --> 00:26:55,155
THE YOUNG MASTER BOUGHT
A HAN RIVER-VIEW APARTMENT IN BANPO

317
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,948
He bought an apartment?

318
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,786
Stop the forced demolition!

319
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,997
We're humans too!

320
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,082
We're humans too!
We're humans too!

321
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,335
Reject the forced demolition

322
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,128
that tramples on people's dwellings!

323
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,589
Reject it! Reject it!

324
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,882
There's a traffic jam.

325
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:15,925
I think they're protesting.

326
00:27:17,552 --> 00:27:19,679
The weak always fight among themselves

327
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,848
when the true enemy is someone else.

328
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,496
Munki, can you pull over?

329
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,344
-Follow me.
-Sir.

330
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:00,762
Okay? Hurry up.

331
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:02,430
Come here!

332
00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:05,266
Hey, stand straight.

333
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,643
I said, stand straight.

334
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,273
How dare you take their side
when I'm paying you?

335
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,527
Hey, whose side are you on?

336
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,613
What are you doing, Lee? Apologize!

337
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,281
Her child was there too.

338
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,702
We can't drag her away
in front of her own child.

339
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,161
Cut that nonsense.

340
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:30,375
Will you take responsibility
if the project gets delayed? Will you?

341
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,377
Answer me, damn it.

342
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,503
Sir, please.

343
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:36,631
What are you doing?
You have no right to hit him!

344
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:37,882
You little punk.

345
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,301
Who are you? His son?

346
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,512
-You little--
-Wait.

347
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,598
He's my son's friend.

348
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,184
I'm truly sorry about today.

349
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,479
-So please--
-Forget it. You're fired.

350
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,900
-Hire better workers, will you?
-I'm sorry, sir.

351
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:57,819
The police are behind you.

352
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,614
Damn it.

353
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:08,538
Look. Why did you make me come
all the way here?

354
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,874
Taeyong, what are you doing here?

355
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:12,667
I'd like to ask you the same question.

356
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:17,172
I thought you were a comic artist,
so why are you here?

357
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:19,799
I'm here to make money.

358
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,844
I thought you didn't care about that.

359
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:26,931
I thought you put your dream
before everything else.

360
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:29,225
Ah.

361
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,811
Did Seungcheon tell you that?

362
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:36,858
Yes, that's right.
But I'm going to change.

363
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,027
I'm going to make money now.

364
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,445
I don't want my son...

365
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,364
to be ashamed of me.

366
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,784
So I'm going to make money.

367
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,829
Why did you decide to make money now?

368
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:55,376
Why didn't you decide that
five or even ten years ago?

369
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,755
You should've just continued
pursuing your dream.

370
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,673
Why would you do this?

371
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,014
Taeyong, what's the matter?

372
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,399
Right, Taeyong!

373
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:23,571
I'm really sorry
to ask you for this favor.

374
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,408
But could you not tell Seungcheon
that you saw me here?

375
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:30,453
He doesn't know that I work here.

376
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,372
Help me out, Seungcheon…

377
00:30:33,706 --> 00:30:36,042
Sorry, I mean Taeyong. Please help me out.

378
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:42,465
Don't worry.

379
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,718
I'm too busy
to talk about such trivial things.

380
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,356
You're such a fool, Dad.

381
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,733
You're way too late.

382
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,739
JUHEE

383
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:12,453
Hmm.

384
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:15,623
What brings you here?

385
00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,500
I have something to ask Taeyong.

386
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,794
I see. But he's not home right now.

387
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,171
You should've called in advance.

388
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,173
Goodbye.

389
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,426
Right, I should have done that.

390
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:27,927
Should I wait inside?

391
00:31:47,739 --> 00:31:49,532
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

392
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,578
This is your first time here, isn't it?
Seungcheon brought me here once.

393
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:55,413
They have a mean tteokbokki and sundae.

394
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,415
It's on me, so eat up.

395
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,417
I'm loaded.

396
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,920
Isn't this too much
for your first paycheck?

397
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,463
I'm just thankful.

398
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:05,423
You even helped me back at work.

399
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:07,884
I owe you a ton.

400
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:10,678
Don't say that.

401
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,264
You've matured so much.

402
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,892
I used to take care of you
back in the day.

403
00:32:16,684 --> 00:32:18,186
I did your homework

404
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,063
and carried you on my back
when you were tired.

405
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,399
I kept you company when you cried
because you missed your mom.

406
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,865
I guess this Hwang Taeyong
was always lousy.

407
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:34,285
That's not true.
You're a good person, Taeyong.

408
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,704
You may look cold and conceited,

409
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,374
but I know you are warm and soft-hearted.

410
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,340
Taeyong, can I ask you something?

411
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,094
Are you okay now?

412
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:53,304
What do you mean?

413
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:57,308
When I heard you returned from the States
because of that shooting incident,

414
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:59,060
I was really worried.

415
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,271
I knew you suffered from a panic disorder,

416
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,690
but I couldn't tell you that.

417
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,818
How are you these days?
Are you taking your medication?

418
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:11,864
Yes, I am.

419
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,826
I'm okay now. That was a while ago.

420
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,452
That's a relief.

421
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:20,498
Let's eat. They're good.

422
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,333
You'll treat me to coffee next, right?

423
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,420
Coffee? Do you drink coffee now?

424
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,049
No, thank you. I don't drink coffee.

425
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,969
Don't you?
Then do you want some black tea?

426
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,221
I don't consume caffeine.

427
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:36,973
I can't go to bed at night if I do.

428
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:41,644
Hibiscus or echinacea tea will do.
Elderberry is good too.

429
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,403
-Elderberry tea.
-Yes, ma'am.

430
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:58,244
Hmm, Taeyong only drinks
herbal tea as well.

431
00:33:58,327 --> 00:34:00,329
You have similar tastes.

432
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:01,581
No way.

433
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,168
Is she seriously comparing me to him?

434
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,211
Do you speak French too?

435
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,089
I take French at school.

436
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,973
Last time, you were pretty good
at playing the piano.

437
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:20,892
Would you like to give it a try?

438
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:29,442
Exactly how much do you get paid
that you're treating me this much?

439
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,360
The hourly pay is 4,580 won.

440
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:34,155
That's a total of 439,680 won.

441
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:38,159
I thought you'd quit your job soon,
but you even got paid.

442
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,745
I'm proud of you, Na Juhee.

443
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,667
Stop that.

444
00:34:49,462 --> 00:34:51,130
By the way, Taeyong.

445
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:54,008
About our engagement…

446
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,678
I doubt we can dissuade our parents.

447
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,515
But once we become adults,
we can make our own decisions.

448
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:03,392
Let's finish everything then,
and stay good friends.

449
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,729
So what you're saying is,

450
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:11,192
that our engagement
will only stay valid until we turn 20.

451
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,694
I'm sorry, but I can't do that.

452
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,447
-Taeyong--
-I'll neither be your friend

453
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,949
nor call off the engagement.

454
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,909
Why? Because I like you.

455
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:24,789
It may not happen right away,
but I'll win your heart one day.

456
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,750
So please stay as my fiancée.

457
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,377
I don't want to be friends.

458
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,043
He makes the same mistake
that Taeyong makes.

459
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,879
How's this possible?

460
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,219
Is that enough?

461
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,388
What?

462
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:27,143
Sure. You're pretty good
at playing the piano.

463
00:36:30,813 --> 00:36:34,108
By any chance, did you practice
by watching Taeyong play the piano?

464
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,361
I've never watched him play.

465
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,658
Ma'am, dinner is ready.

466
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:51,584
Since Taeyong isn't here yet,
shall we chat some more over dinner?

467
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,502
No, thank you.

468
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,423
I don't eat just anywhere.

469
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,384
What are you talking about?

470
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,470
You ate at our house many times.

471
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,765
You brought your golden spoon
and even ate two meals.

472
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:11,520
I ate two meals at this house?

473
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:18,110
With a golden spoon?

474
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,325
Please wait in the guestroom.

475
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,412
No. I'm going to wait in Taeyong's room.

476
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:30,748
Then let me take you there.

477
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:33,334
No need. It's that room.

478
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:41,842
That darn brat knows no manners.

479
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:46,806
Has he been to that room before?

480
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:03,906
That's random.

481
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,833
Looks much better here.

482
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,982
They always have
a secret drawer in movies.

483
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:50,286
What? So it's true.

484
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,417
What the…

485
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,049
How dare he draw Juhee
without my permission?

486
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:06,677
That bastard.

487
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:09,055
How pretty.

488
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,568
What a pretty lady.

489
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,205
What is this?

490
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:41,629
The golden spoon.

491
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,403
Lee Seungcheon is here?

492
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:07,488
-Yes, sir. He's in your room.
-Damn it.

493
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,014
Hey, Lee Seungcheon.

494
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,603
-What are you doing?
-This is mine, right?

495
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,605
Why would it be yours?

496
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:44,483
I remember eating at your place
with a golden spoon.

497
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,026
But I couldn't find it.

498
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:49,488
I thought I'd come by and check.
And here it is.

499
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,115
Don't be absurd.

500
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,367
This is mine. It's my golden spoon.

501
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,328
Then where's mine?

502
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:57,580
How would I know?

503
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,082
Hey, why are you getting worked up
over something so trivial?

504
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,792
Because you barged into my room

505
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,170
and looked through my stuff.

506
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:05,463
Don't you think that's rude?

507
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,884
You're right. I admit it.

508
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,974
But you did overreact. See you.

509
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:46,420
Lee Seungcheon!

510
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,470
I was a bit sensitive back there.

511
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,680
This is my apology.

512
00:41:56,764 --> 00:41:58,015
They're really good supplements.

513
00:41:58,098 --> 00:42:00,726
They're just for you, so take one daily.

514
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:05,940
I'll take it since you offered,
but I can't say thank you.

515
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,257
He must've been embarrassed
by how he treated me.

516
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,137
I guess I won't be getting
my mom a gold ring.

517
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,976
Lee Seungcheon?

518
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,950
Yes. I knew it was you.

519
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:02,079
It's been a long time.

520
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,125
I doubt you're here to have another meal.

521
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:11,005
No, sir. I just…

522
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,925
Since you're here,
can I have a word with you?

523
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:23,100
I'm sorry, but I should go.

524
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,771
What's the matter?
Am I making you uncomfortable?

525
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:35,863
I mean…

526
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:38,907
You don't look too well. Are you okay?

527
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:42,494
I'm fine. I just have plans.

528
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:43,829
I'm sorry.

529
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:21,033
Be good to our boss.
Don't get on his bad side.

530
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,618
Jeez.

531
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,830
You got scolded because of me.

532
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,624
I'm sorry.

533
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,544
You're too kindhearted
for your own good. Jeez.

534
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:36,382
About Jeong…

535
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:37,675
Jeong Euinam? What about him?

536
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:40,010
Is he stuck at the police station?

537
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:43,389
I'm afraid it'll take him a while
this time around because of that girl.

538
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:46,975
I'm lucky that I'm not a father.

539
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:52,106
Why are you laughing?

540
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:55,776
I feel happy just watching the kids grow.

541
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:58,445
But you don't have any money.
Are they for your satisfaction?

542
00:44:58,529 --> 00:45:00,823
People will tell you off
for saying such a thing nowadays.

543
00:45:01,407 --> 00:45:02,282
Is that so?

544
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:08,622
MY SON

545
00:45:10,165 --> 00:45:11,166
Hey, son.

546
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,089
Seungcheon, what's wrong? Are you crying?

547
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:21,510
I'll be there soon.

548
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:25,139
I'm on my way there right now!
Stay there! I'll be there soon!

549
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:44,742
Hey, is something wrong?

550
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:46,660
Oh, my. Are you all right?

551
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:50,038
Hey, kid. What's wrong?

552
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:01,842
Seungcheon!

553
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,802
Seungcheon!

554
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,596
Seungcheon!

555
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:09,099
Hey! What's wrong? Seungcheon!

556
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,976
-Dad.
-You're okay.

557
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:13,729
Dad, I can't breathe.

558
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:14,938
You're okay.

559
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:20,068
Seungcheon, you're okay. Look at me.

560
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:21,945
Follow me.

561
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,947
Inhale.

562
00:46:25,157 --> 00:46:25,991
Exhale.

563
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:28,702
Inhale.

564
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,704
Exhale.

565
00:46:31,455 --> 00:46:32,331
Inhale again!

566
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,459
Exhale.

567
00:46:36,460 --> 00:46:38,337
You're doing well. Inhale.

568
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,005
Exhale.

569
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,757
It's happened to me before.

570
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:45,260
You may feel like you're suffocating,
but you won't die. Don't worry.

571
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:46,553
Breathe.

572
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,639
And you'll be fine soon.

573
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:49,640
Inhale.

574
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:52,559
And exhale.

575
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,855
Well done, my son.

576
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:00,609
Good job.

577
00:47:02,152 --> 00:47:03,237
Well done.

578
00:47:09,701 --> 00:47:10,786
Well done.

579
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,042
Like a meadow after a storm.

580
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,673
Like the calm sea.

581
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:27,094
You'll feel relaxed.

582
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,059
Well done.

583
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,728
Well done, my son.

584
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,154
That kid, Lee Seungcheon,

585
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:49,241
was really strange.

586
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:56,790
He didn't drink coffee,

587
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,792
spoke French, and played the piano.

588
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:03,255
Sure, he could mimic Taeyong's playing.

589
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,508
But he made the same mistake

590
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,427
that Taeyong always did.

591
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:10,596
Isn't that so odd?

592
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:17,311
So? What are you trying to say?

593
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:30,365
I'm telling you
that we should be wary of him.

594
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,956
Ever since Taeyong got involved with him,

595
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,625
he's changed so much.

596
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,876

NAME: AHN MUIN
NAME: HWANG TAEYONG

599
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:45,756
He bought an apartment?

600
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,966
I think it was for that kid.

601
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:59,561
They're trying to trace
the burner phone of that witness,

602
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,563
but the police say it won't be easy.

603
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,358
We have no choice then.

604
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:07,361
Make sure you observe
the students at school carefully.

605
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:09,154
Yes, sir.

606
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,243
So about Taeyong…

607
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:23,335
What does he think
of that kid, Lee Seungcheon?

608
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:29,675
He pities him.

609

611
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:38,517
Pity?

612
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:47,693
Is Taeyong doing anything behind my back?

613
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,195
No, sir.

614
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,208
-You may go.
-Yes, sir.

615
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,095
So you're lying to me?

616
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,773
I did as you told me to, so what is this?

617
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:29,234
You turned me into a fool.

618
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,778
They're all mad at me.

619
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:35,198
Didn't you say you wanted to get
Hwang Taeyong into trouble?

620
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,534
He did get into trouble.

621
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:38,618
Don't be absurd.

622
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:40,620
Why did you make me do this?

623
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,667
You're the impatient type, aren't you?

624
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,544
This is just the beginning.

625
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:48,545
The beginning?

626
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:51,298
Then what's next?

627
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,885
I won't forgive Hwang Taeyong
for what he did to me.

628
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:57,429
I'm going to get that bastard back.

629
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:01,475
Calm down. As for the next step…

630
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,603
I'll tell you when it's time.

631
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,901
Oh Yeojin, you can't just leave like this.

632
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:12,444
Why did you want to see me today?

633
00:51:15,447 --> 00:51:19,701
Janggun, I just missed you. That's all.

634
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:29,252
She missed me?

635
00:51:32,047 --> 00:51:33,590
Oh Yeojin missed me?

636
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:09,918
Is this the police?
I have something to report.

You should've treated me better.

641
00:53:20,655 --> 00:53:21,781
Bye, Dad.

642
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:25,744
I hope we never cross paths again.

643
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:43,553
All right.

644
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,852
Hey, do you go around lying
that you're a hair designer?

645
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:51,770
What?

646
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:56,066
Someone wants to get his hair done by you.

647
00:54:11,748 --> 00:54:14,501
I can't believe
you actually took my word and came.

648
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:16,253
I'm going to get an earful later.

649
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:23,426
Please persuade Lee Seungcheon's sister.

00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:24,970
She's greedy and easily influenced.

651
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,638
But most of all, she's materialistic.

652
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:30,016
-Do you know anyone looking for housing?
-Especially about apartments.

653
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,185
It's a new apartment
overlooking the Han River.

654
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:34,854
A new apartment?

655
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:37,524
Yes. It has three bedrooms
and two bathrooms.

656
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,778
I heard the deposit is 40 million
and the rent is 300 thousand.

657
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:44,364
Are you serious?

658
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:46,324
-Yes.
-Why is it so cheap?

659
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:49,411
My acquaintance had to hurry
and leave for the States.

660
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:53,206
So do you know anyone
who's looking for a place?

661
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:56,126
Or perhaps, would you be interested?

662
00:54:56,793 --> 00:54:58,378
Me? That'd be so…

663
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,300
Hold on. Why are you telling me this?

664
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:06,428
Something's fishy.

665
00:55:07,012 --> 00:55:09,306
Are you a conman?

666
00:55:10,307 --> 00:55:12,475
I can promise you that's not true.

667
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:15,729
If you're suspicious,
ask the realtor nearby.

668
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:17,522
A 40 million deposit
and a 300 thousand rent?

669
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,697
Yeah. Thanks, Munki.

670
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,656
Thanks a lot.

671
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,909
MUNKI

672
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,790
I hope they get to finally move with this.

673
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:39,377
Taeyong.

674
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:51,431
Look at you.

675
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,684
I know it's been a while,
but you're hurting my feelings.

676
00:55:54,768 --> 00:55:55,769
No greetings?

677
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:59,731
"It's been a while?"
Is he Taeyong's cousin?

678
00:56:00,982 --> 00:56:03,985
Right. Hey, it's been a long time.

679
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,154
What? "Hey"?

680
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,825
Look at you. You've grown so much.

681
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:14,162
That's no way to address your uncle.

682
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:15,914
-"Uncle?"
-That's okay, sir.

683
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:19,042
-As in, her younger brother?
-I feel closer to him that way.

684
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:22,253
Juntae, there's no need
to address him as "sir."

685
00:56:22,337 --> 00:56:24,672
Just call him by his first name
when you're home.

686
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:27,342
-Honey, is that okay with you?
-Of course.

687
00:56:28,301 --> 00:56:30,178
When are you returning to the US?

688
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,806
Honey.

689
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:37,310
Hyeondo, I just flew in today.
Are you telling me to leave already?

690
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,897
You're being too cold
to your one and only brother-in-law.

691
00:56:40,980 --> 00:56:41,815
Is that so?

692
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:45,318
Let's eat. It's time.

693
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,286
Juntae, that's the man
I have to put up with.

694
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:05,672
I knew it would suit you.
You like it too, right?

695
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:25,984
I heard you prepared a surprise event
for your father on your birthday.

696
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,069
Did he tell you that?

697
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,196
No, I just heard from people around.

698
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:34,993
I know what you're up to
even when I'm in the States.

699
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:37,162
I'm proud of you.

700
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,834
Don't be. It was nothing grand.

701
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,135
You've become quite gutsy, haven't you?

702
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:53,636
You rude bastard.

703
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:56,222
What did you call me? "Hey"?

704
00:57:56,973 --> 00:57:58,725
How dare you look me in the eye?

705
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:02,061
You couldn't even say anything back
five years ago.

706
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,081
Let's get along during my time here.

707
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,379
We're family after all.

708
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:46,314
FRIED CHICKEN

709
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,195
One chicken per person.

710
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,701
I've always wanted to do this.

711
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:04,165
You can each have
a whole chicken to yourself.

712
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,127
Eat up.

713
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,222
Is he working at a chicken joint?

714
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:21,182
-It's really fried chicken.
-What is this?

715
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:35,071
Why did you decide to make money now?

716
00:59:35,572 --> 00:59:37,657
I wonder why he said that.

717
00:59:39,033 --> 00:59:40,326
He even got teary-eyed.

718
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,007
-Honey, do your shoulders hurt a lot?
-What?

719
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,551
No, they're fine.

720
00:59:57,051 --> 01:00:01,556
This is because my drawings
were the best over there.

721
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,308
I had no choice but to draw a lot.

722
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,476
Their drawings were all lousy.

723
01:00:05,977 --> 01:00:07,812
You were moaning in pain while sleeping.

724
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,897
-Let me see.
-It's fine.

725
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,694
My goodness.

726
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:22,535
Seonhye.

727
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:26,372
I've put you through so much. I'm sorry.

728
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:28,499
What's gotten into you?

729
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:31,210
I'm on cloud nine today.

730
01:00:31,961 --> 01:00:33,630
I got us chicken with the money I earned.

731
01:00:34,672 --> 01:00:36,507
I'll get you cosmetics next time.

732
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:41,346
Thank you.

733
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:44,682
But I wish you could draw your own comics

734
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,851
instead of for someone else.

735
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:06,162
-Why aren't you coming out?
-Let's go.

736
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,706
Let's go conquer that chicken.

737
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:09,832
What were you up to?

738
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,044
It looks fine.

739
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:15,463
-No way.
-Let's eat.

740
01:01:15,838 --> 01:01:17,548
That sure looks good.

741
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:52,750
He's good.

742
01:01:53,459 --> 01:01:56,379
This one is practically a photo.

743
01:02:04,637 --> 01:02:05,471
Seungcheon.

744
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,309
What is it? Is it not that good?

745
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:15,940
No, I love it. You're amazing.

746
01:02:16,649 --> 01:02:18,526
Our son is better than you.

747
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:20,945
That's not true.

748
01:02:21,028 --> 01:02:24,741
Right, should we move to an apartment?

749
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:25,658
What?

750
01:02:26,117 --> 01:02:29,078
It's a new three-bedroom apartment
overlooking the Han River.

751
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:32,290
The deposit is 40 million
and the rent is 300 thousand.

752
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:33,916
-Cheap, right?
-Come on.

753
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:37,503
That's ridiculous.
No one would charge that little.

754
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,505
I'm telling you.

755
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:44,051
Remember that guy who helped me
when the landlord caused a scene?

756
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:45,845
What was his name again?

757
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:48,681
-Right. Jang Munki.
-What?

758
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,517
-Jang Munki.
-Jang Munki?

759
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,978
Jang Munki? Tall, thick eyebrows,

760
01:02:54,061 --> 01:02:56,814
-and drives a white, foreign car?
-Yes. How did you know?

761
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,692
He's Taeyong's driver.

762
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:02,236
This must all be Hwang Taeyong's doing.

763
01:03:02,987 --> 01:03:05,072
Why does he keep meddling in our affairs?

764
01:03:05,406 --> 01:03:06,324
Beats me.

765
01:03:08,075 --> 01:03:08,910
It's me.

766
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:11,746
It's because of me.

767
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,041
He must've fallen head over heels for me.

768
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:19,170
Jeez, poor Taeyong.

769
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:23,800
But I must say,
he has an eye for the ladies.

770
01:03:23,883 --> 01:03:25,218
-Sungah!
-Yes?

771
01:03:25,301 --> 01:03:27,678
It's true that I don't really like
Hwang Taeyong,

772
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:29,806
but he has high standards for girls.

773
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,934
-You're not his type.
-You little…

774
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:33,935
-Hey.
-Hey!

775
01:03:34,018 --> 01:03:35,645
-There you go again.
-Hey, this is mine.

776
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:38,231
Be pretty then.

777
01:03:38,940 --> 01:03:40,983
Mom, I'm pretty. Aren't I?

778
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,569
-Of course you are.
-You have a bad eye for the ladies.

779
01:03:44,904 --> 01:03:46,364
I'm popular, you know?

780
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:49,784
Dad, the male customers
at the salon love me.

781
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,702
Come on.

782
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,162
There you go again.

783
01:03:53,246 --> 01:03:54,455
Hey, you know what they were doing?

784
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,707
They were in their room--

785
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:58,334
What's going on?

786
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:00,169
Guess what they were doing.

787
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,031
They're doing well without me.

788
01:05:09,572 --> 01:05:11,949
Stop this brutal redevelopment!

789
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:13,784
Stop it! Stop it!

790
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:16,871
End this redevelopment that only benefits

791
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:18,497
the corporation and architects!

792
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:21,083
End it! End it!

793
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,210
We are against this forced removal!

794
01:05:23,294 --> 01:05:25,796
We shall fight to the end!

795
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,965
Let's fight! Let's fight!

796
01:05:46,275 --> 01:05:48,027
All right! Let's go upstairs!

797
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:49,362
Let's go!

798
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,405
Let's go!

799
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,169
Sir!

800
01:06:06,128 --> 01:06:07,922
Sir, are you okay?

801
01:06:08,005 --> 01:06:09,966
-Yes, I am.
-Wait.

802
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:12,551
I'll go first. You can follow behind.

803
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,681
Forget it. Unlike you,
I don't have any precious kids.

804
01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,557
Just take care of yourself. Let's go.

805
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:53,592
All right.

806
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,888
I'm going to live on as Hwang Taeyong.

807
01:07:10,484 --> 01:07:11,819
LEE SEUNGCHEON

808
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,994
So you're offering an apartment to us?

809
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:22,997
What's in it for you?

810
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:26,250
For me? Nothing, really.

811
01:07:27,918 --> 01:07:29,128
Don't make me laugh.

812
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,213
I can see right through you.

813
01:07:32,423 --> 01:07:33,591
It's because of Juhee.

814
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,428
-What?
-It's obvious.

815
01:07:38,137 --> 01:07:39,972
You want me to give up on her
for the apartment.

816
01:07:40,556 --> 01:07:41,807
That's what you want.

817
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:45,394
Think however you want.

818
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,481
Anyway, you should move in there.

819
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:51,067
For your family's sake.

820
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:53,402
You immature bastard.

821
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:57,490
Fine. Let's say I let her go.

822
01:07:58,282 --> 01:07:59,909
Do you think she'll like you then?

823
01:07:59,992 --> 01:08:02,870
I'm sorry to say this,
but I'm certain that she likes me.

824
01:08:03,913 --> 01:08:04,830
I'm positive.

825
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:11,545
Fine. Let's say she likes you for now.

826
01:08:11,629 --> 01:08:13,589
But how long will it last?

827
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:15,174
Your parents are poor.

828
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,635
And you'll be even worse off.

829
01:08:21,806 --> 01:08:22,848
Hwang Taeyong.

830
01:08:24,141 --> 01:08:25,810
All you care about is money.

831
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:28,104
But I'm different.

832
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:29,897
I don't care how much money I have.

833
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:32,024
Do you know why?

834
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:34,985
Because I'm Lee Seungcheon.

835
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:37,279
Take all the filthy money you want.

836
01:08:37,363 --> 01:08:38,405
Filthy money?

837
01:08:39,949 --> 01:08:42,827
Let me give you a reality check.

838
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:45,538
Some even abandon their parents
for that filthy money.

839
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:47,123
Abandon your parents for money?

840
01:08:47,206 --> 01:08:49,708
Stop spouting crap.
Only a piece of trash would do that.

841
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:52,586
What about you?
Do you think you'll be any different?

842
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:56,674
You say money isn't important,
but that's just a big, fat lie.

843
01:08:57,258 --> 01:08:58,884
If you could trade your parents

844
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:01,929
for wealthy ones,

845
01:09:04,306 --> 01:09:05,599
you would do that in a heartbeat.

846
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:08,477
Can you say otherwise?

847
01:09:15,985 --> 01:09:18,988
SELF-STUDY TIME

848
01:09:53,147 --> 01:09:55,399
Where's Lee Seungcheon?

849
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,658
I would never trade.

850
01:10:04,742 --> 01:10:06,619
No matter how rich I may become,

851
01:10:07,328 --> 01:10:08,287
I would never do that.

852
01:10:08,871 --> 01:10:10,831
I love my parents
more than anything in this world.

853
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,125
I would never trade them.

854
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:15,461
Don't make me laugh.

855
01:10:16,420 --> 01:10:19,548
It's hypocritical and a lie
to say that you like poor parents.

856
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:21,425
Imagine you'd become me.
You've seen my place.

857
01:10:21,508 --> 01:10:24,220
What if that house, money,
and everything else were yours?

858
01:10:24,303 --> 01:10:25,471
Would you still say no?

859
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,264
No matter what you say,

860
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:30,142
I'll never change my parents.

861
01:10:31,143 --> 01:10:33,354
Taeyong, money isn't everything.

862
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:36,148
I can't stand your mom and dad.

863
01:10:37,107 --> 01:10:38,943
Instead of living
with such suffocating parents,

864
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:41,487
I'd rather be poor.

865
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:43,489
That's my answer.

866
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:50,287
Seungcheon! Seungcheon!

867
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:54,208
This is bad. It's about your dad.

868
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,715
SUNGAH

869
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:03,676
Hello?

870
01:11:04,551 --> 01:11:06,595
Sungah, why would Dad be in the ER?

871
01:11:07,179 --> 01:11:08,514
Okay. I'm on my way.

872
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:11,225
-What happened?
-Move!

873
01:11:12,351 --> 01:11:13,435
His dad is seriously hurt.

874
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,521
Wait for me, Seungcheon!

875
01:11:15,604 --> 01:11:17,481
Dad. No.

876
01:11:27,491 --> 01:11:30,452
I don't want my son to be ashamed of me.

877
01:11:30,536 --> 01:11:33,664
Could you not tell Seungcheon
that you saw me here?

878
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:41,380
My drawings were made into comic books.

879
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:42,923
Look.

880
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:48,387
You're the best!

881
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:50,764
-I'm the best!
-You're the best!

882
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,183
I'm the best!

883
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:56,687
-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

884
01:11:56,770 --> 01:12:00,441
-♪ Happy birthday, my dear son ♪
-♪ Happy birthday ♪

885
01:12:01,025 --> 01:12:03,444
-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

886
01:12:07,031 --> 01:12:08,490
Dad.

887
01:12:09,199 --> 01:12:10,284
Dad.

888
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:17,750
Munki!

889
01:12:17,958 --> 01:12:19,084
Munki.

890
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:29,261
Taxi!

891
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:34,475
Young master!

892
01:12:35,434 --> 01:12:36,310
Young master!

893
01:12:57,664 --> 01:12:58,624
Seungcheon.

894
01:13:08,509 --> 01:13:10,469
DOSIN HOSPITAL

895
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:19,645
Dad.

896
01:13:23,690 --> 01:13:24,733
Dad.

897
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:26,068
Dad!

898
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:34,451
Dad.

899
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:06,233
Choices always come with a price.
"I hope it's not too late

900
01:14:06,316 --> 01:14:08,735
when you get this letter.

901
01:14:09,778 --> 01:14:12,030
I wish you luck."

902
01:14:14,366 --> 01:14:17,035
She's one interesting lady.

903
01:15:02,289 --> 01:15:04,458
Hey, get me more booze.

904
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:06,710
I said, get more!

905
01:15:06,793 --> 01:15:08,629
Dad, that's enough.

906
01:15:08,712 --> 01:15:10,380
Damn it!

907
01:15:10,464 --> 01:15:13,800
How dare you glare at me like that?

908
01:15:13,884 --> 01:15:15,052
Come here.

909
01:15:15,761 --> 01:15:18,889
Leave, you brat.
Leave just like your mom did.

910
01:15:19,515 --> 01:15:21,099
You damn brat!

911
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:22,726
Do you want to die?

912
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:25,270
I'll kill you today. Damn it!

913
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,775
Hey, stop right there!

914
01:15:29,983 --> 01:15:32,528
Hey! Jeong Nara!

915
01:15:33,987 --> 01:15:35,113
Come back here!

916
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:42,371
You little…

917
01:15:44,748 --> 01:15:49,378
You're dead when you come home! Got that?

918
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:56,760
Come and look.

919
01:15:57,010 --> 01:15:59,638
This golden spoon can make you rich.

920
01:15:59,721 --> 01:16:01,932
This golden spoon can make you rich.

921
01:16:02,015 --> 01:16:05,018
This golden spoon can make you rich.

922
01:16:05,185 --> 01:16:08,855
Come and get a golden spoon.

923
01:16:13,277 --> 01:16:14,111
What's the matter?

924
01:16:14,861 --> 01:16:18,073
Do you want to change your parents
and become rich as well?

925
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:42,598
Why do you keep eating here
instead of at your own place?

926
01:16:43,849 --> 01:16:45,267
Our master doesn't like it.

927
01:16:46,101 --> 01:16:47,352
Stop it.

928
01:16:50,355 --> 01:16:52,232
Nara, come and eat whenever you want.

929
01:17:33,148 --> 01:17:35,150
That's dirty, Nara!

930
01:17:43,033 --> 01:17:44,034
Yeojin?

931
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,453
Hey.

932
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:49,790
I don't like it. Make it again.

933
01:17:51,416 --> 01:17:52,459
All right.

934
01:17:55,712 --> 01:17:58,256
Nara, you should eat here before you go.

935
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,551
There's no food at your place anyway.

936
01:18:14,064 --> 01:18:16,149
JEONG NARA

937
01:18:58,734 --> 01:19:01,611
Please save him.
I don't want the golden spoon anymore.

938
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,822
Won't you regret it?

939
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:05,824
I like you, Seungcheon.

940
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,909
I have the same one.
Are you sure this is yours?

941
01:19:09,536 --> 01:19:12,205
I'll put up my life as collateral.

942
01:19:12,330 --> 01:19:14,416
I'm going to die, I'll kill myself!

943
01:19:14,791 --> 01:19:16,918
You can't die right now.

944
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:18,462
So it was you.

945
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:20,172
How could you…

946
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,841
Wait for me.
I'll come back with 100 billion won.

947
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:25,260
You're under arrest for murder.
