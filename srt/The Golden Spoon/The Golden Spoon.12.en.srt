1
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,826
How do you feel right now?

2
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,327
Why did you kill him?

3
00:00:36,411 --> 00:00:38,288
Why did you turn yourself in?

4
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,664
Any words for the bereaved family?

5
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:42,667
Seo Juntae claims

6
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,878
he turned himself in
due to feelings of guilt

7
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,297
and pressure from the request
to reinvestigate the case.

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,424
An emergency airing of Seo Juntae.

9
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:50,800
Nice.

10
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,219
You know our channel received
the highest ratings, right?

11
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:58,641
I can't believe DSTV actually aired that.

12
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,977
Dosin had already cut ties with him.

13
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:05,023
Plus, defending a murderer
would only taint their reputation.

14
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,193
It would have been even better
if Ms. Na had been interviewed.

15
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,820
Would it have hurt to say
that she had avenged her father

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:11,988
in front of the camera?

17
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:13,448
She doesn't know television.

18
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:16,367
And you don't know people at all.

19
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,744
Jeez.

20
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:43,770
Dad.

21
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,689
You've waited a long time.

22
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:48,691
I'm sorry.

23
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,986
It's all over now.

24
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,030
So now,

25
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,241
you can rest in peace.

26
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,087
He must be doing well there, right?

27
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,050
Taeyong.

28
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,224
I dreamed of my dad last night
for the first time in a long time.

29
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:24,561
Every time he appeared,

30
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:28,189
I bawled even in my dreams.

31
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,192
Maybe he didn't want to see that.

32
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:37,365
I saw him again for the first time
in a long time.

33
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:40,493
And I didn't cry.

34
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:47,208
I smiled at him.

35
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:52,922
Thanks.

36
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,427
I'm sorry about everything.

37
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:01,514
I'm truly sorry that I suspected you.

38
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,898
What matters is that
you know the truth now.

39
00:03:12,692 --> 00:03:15,486
Does this mean
we can go back to how things were?

40
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,156
Of course.

41
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,994
We meet again, my childhood friend.

42
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:30,251
It really has been

43
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:33,755
a long time, Na Juhee.

44
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,276
I told President Hwang everything.

45
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,446
I thought you would need his help.

46
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:02,992
I knew it.

47
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,746
No wonder Seo Juntae turned himself in.

48
00:04:07,538 --> 00:04:08,873
You're right.

49
00:04:10,083 --> 00:04:11,501
It was too much for me to handle.

50
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:16,923
But why do you treat me so well?

51
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,885
I told you.

52
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:25,682
Your late mother
was the closest thing I had to a family.

53
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,893
In that case,

54
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:31,896
I guess I'm your one and only family now.

55
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:36,609
But what kind
of an older brother uses honorifics?

56
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,152
Just talk casually to me.

57
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,698
Should I, Taeyong?

58
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,163
-It's easier to speak formally.
-Right.

59
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,256
By the way, why do you look so gloomy?

60
00:04:58,673 --> 00:04:59,757
Everything panned out.

61
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:04,387
It's just that things resolved so easily.

62
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:06,806
And…

63
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,975
You know the golden spoon granny,
don't you?

64
00:05:12,061 --> 00:05:13,104
Have a drink.

65
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:43,384
Judging by the fact that you can see me,

66
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:46,888
you must be pretty desperate.

67
00:05:50,266 --> 00:05:51,100
This…

68
00:05:55,563 --> 00:05:58,274
GOLDEN SPOON THAT MAKES YOU RICH
30,000 WON

69
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:02,862
Granny, Hwang Taeyong
bought one of these, right?

70
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,199
That's how he became Hwang Taeyong
when he's actually Lee Seungcheon.

71
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,160
Hwang Taeyong? Lee Seungcheon?
Who are those people?

72
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,329
Jeez, I don't know who they are.

73
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,039
Will you buy that or not?

74
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:18,252
Can this really swap my parents?

75
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:21,756
Leave if you don't believe me.

76
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:24,550
The choice is up to you, anyway.

77
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,886
I only offer you the opportunity.

78
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,972
What do you say?

79
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,393
Would you like to seize this opportunity?

80
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,772
It was just as the notebook said.

81
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,857
The old woman

82
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,276
really exists.

83
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,488
That means…

84
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,990
I'm Hwang Taeyong.

85
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,584
SUCCESS AFTER SUCCESS

86
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,759
We'll order a few more dishes from now on.

87
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,303
Thank you.

88
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,347
Let me.

89
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:18,229
Right.

90
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,983
Do you have any leftovers?
I haven't had breakfast yet.

91
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,195
Uh…

92
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:18,122
Mr. Hwang, why do you want
to pursue a spin-off?

93
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,957
Are you intimidated
by the FSC's guidelines?

94
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:23,920
I think he just wants people to love him.

95
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:26,088
Don't be too concerned
about the small stockholders.

96
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,341
Protecting the small stockholders' rights.

97
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,843
Sure. That's meaningful.

98
00:08:31,427 --> 00:08:33,596
Governance is crucial in this day and age,

99
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,099
so it's important to abide by ESG
and reconsider the shareholder value.

100
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,477
But what's even more important is

101
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:41,562
money.

102
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,190
All the more reason why
physical division is necessary, right?

103
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,193
Where will you get the R&D fund?

104
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,278
Bequest? Corporate bond?

105
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,114
Doing so could put our company at risk.

106
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,825
What if we could turn that risk
into an opportunity?

107
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,957
Physical division is wise
when it comes to risk hedging.

108
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,460
But on the downside,
we'd have to share our rights.

109
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,755
If we're confident in our new technology,

110
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,300
then we wouldn't need to share our rights.

111
00:09:11,884 --> 00:09:13,803
Because we'd get more money that way.

112
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,513
In addition,

113
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,723
seven percent of Dosin Hightech's shares

114
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,017
are owned by Golden Money Investment.

115
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,103
And its CEO, Alex Boo

116
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,981
also owns shares of our rival,
TQ Electronics.

117
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,983
Since the physical division
would require him

118
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,360
to invest more in our company,

119
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,612
that would be too much for him?

120
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,905
Correct.

121
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,324
Considering everything,

122
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,703
we should be listed after the spin-off.

123
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,496
That is my take on this.

124
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:51,173
Enough with your gimmick.

125
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,678
Tell me

126
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:57,972
your real plan.

127
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:04,437
I want to dilute Uncle Juntae's shares.

128
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,897
It's true that there's nothing
he can do right now,

129
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,067
but he still has Mother.

130
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,528
While the new business
is up for public purchase,

131
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:15,156
I want to personally buy
the holding company's shares.

132
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,578
Simply put, you want me to spend my money

133
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,414
on your succession?

134
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,417
It'll benefit you eventually.

135
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,003
After all, I'm your son.

136
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,675
I'll think about it. You may go.

137
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,898
You're the reason
Seo Juntae turned himself in, right?

138
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,151
Thank you.

139
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,657
You should have told me everything
from the beginning.

140
00:10:58,783 --> 00:10:59,909
I was afraid

141
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:02,828
that you wouldn't believe me.

142
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,046
That's just ridiculous.

143
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,426
I knew…

144
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:23,516
that you didn't murder anyone.

145
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,270
My son, Hwang Hyeondo's son

146
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,732
would never do such a thing.

147
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,292
He knew that Taeyong didn't kill anyone?

148
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,716
He must have meant that
he wanted to believe it, right?

149
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,101
DOCUMENTARY NOTE:
MOST LAB'S YOUNG CEO, HWANG TAEYONG

150
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,233
YOU CANNOT BELITTLE MY HARD-EARNED…

151
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:23,492
Does this mean
we can go back to how things were?

152
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,621
As in friends?

153
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:30,207
Juhee.

154
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,384
Mmm.

155
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:45,014
My work had piled up,
so I was going to skip lunch.

156
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:45,973
You're the best.

157
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:49,977
Why aren't you eating?

158
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:53,105
I already ate at a friend's house.

159
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,232
I see. Mm.

160
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,402
I was actually about to call you.

161
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,322
What for? To thank me?

162
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,657
Since everything panned out thanks to me?

163
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,617
How did you know?

164
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:10,206
Your perseverance for the past decade
is what helped you come this far.

165
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:13,125
I'm proud of you.

166
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,044
I'm pretty awesome, right?

167
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,757
Right. When's Taeyong's interview airing?

168
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,842
Ah. Let's see.

169
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:26,013
SEUNGCHEON'S BIRTHDAY
HWANG TAEYONG'S SPECIAL AIRING

170
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,140
It's on you and Taeyong's birthday.

171
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:30,142
Is that so?

172
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,103
Seungcheon, what do you want
as your birthday gift?

173
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,149
My birthday gift?

174
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,489
Can you forget everything?

175
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,575
Everything that I said to you.

176
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:48,744
As in, when I confessed to you.

177
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:52,790
I think I was burdening you.

178
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,209
So I've made up my mind.

179
00:13:56,377 --> 00:13:58,003
Let's remain good friends.

180
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,590
Forget about Lee Seungcheon.

181
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,557
Eat up.

182
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,568
Juhee.

183
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,320
I'm going to return to my old self.

184
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:26,156
I'll become Hwang Taeyong once again

185
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:28,993
and confess my love to you.

186
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,207
Cheers!

187
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,170
Gosh, that's good.

188
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:43,090
Nothing tops makgeolli
when it comes to alcohol.

189
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:55,978
Why are you drinking so much
when everything worked out fine?

190
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:57,980
Is it because of Seungcheon?

191
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:01,150
A part of me is relieved
that he wants to remain friends.

192
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:05,529
But I also hate myself
for not being able to accept his feelings.

193
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,949
In the past, I liked him more.

194
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,410
You can't force yourself to fall in love.

195
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:15,122
You're just each other's first love.
Nothing more, nothing less.

196
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:18,459
Right, I visited that diner again today.

197
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,586
And apparently, the suitcase lady
hadn't been coming.

198
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,254
I think she's avoiding you.

199
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:27,217
You said you had 500 million won in there?
I wonder where she spent all that money.

200
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,428
Mmm.

201
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,890
You know what?
I think I'm really materialistic.

202
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,517
That money wasn't proper.

203
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:39,772
I try to tell myself
that it wasn't mine to begin with.

204
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,316
But it still pops into my head at times.

205
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,819
"Would things have turned out differently
if I had that money?"

206
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:47,196
It would have been.

207
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,156
Having that much money back then

208
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,951
would have gotten you
an apartment in Seoul, a car, and…

209
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:55,746
But what's the use now? Let's drink up.

210
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,707
Ma'am, one more bottle of makgeolli!

211
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:02,294
Huh?

212
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:05,255
What is it?

213
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,007
What?

214
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:11,345
Ah. Never mind. I thought I saw someone.

215
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:19,895
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think Juntae would do such a thing.

216
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,231
Aren't you shocked as well?

217
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:23,816
What are you doing?

218
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:25,526
Can't you see?

219
00:16:25,943 --> 00:16:27,736
Guys pamper themselves too now.

220
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,030
Can I take one?

221
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,783
-Do as you wish.
-I like it.

222
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:33,951
Janggun.

223
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:35,869
Which one's better?

224
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,496
Doesn't this look better?

225
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:40,666
Pick either one. They all look the same.

226
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,919
Then this one.

227
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:47,339
Right. What should I prepare
as a thank you gift for the wedding?

228
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,426
Why are you asking me?

229
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,470
Discuss it with your groom.
It's his wedding too.

230
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:56,306
Taeyong is busy, so I should understand.

231
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,809
Yeojin, what happened to you?

232
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:02,604
Yeojin, you should be the one
reigning like a queen.

233
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,566
You should have the upper hand.

234
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:08,694
So what's all this?

235
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,571
Why do you let him walk all over you?

236
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,114
Park Janggun, that's enough.

237
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,116
No. Not even.

238
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,745
I was the one who accompanied your father
to pick your wedding date.

239
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,040
You know how shocked he was
after visiting the shaman, right?

240
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,416
What?

241
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,918
You have no idea, do you?

242
00:17:25,002 --> 00:17:28,255
He was extremely shocked to hear that

243
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:30,382
you had died more than a decade ago.

244
00:17:30,466 --> 00:17:32,718
Why do I have to comfort him
when I'm not even your fiancé?

245
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,844
Hold on.

246
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,680
What are you talking about?

247
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:45,981
Ten million won for one of these?

248
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:51,195
No. This will help my Yeojin
live a long life.

249
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,404
Money isn't the problem here.

250
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,299
This is the guy
that used to live at my place.

251
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,301
Why does she have these?

252
00:18:15,135 --> 00:18:16,512
What are you doing?

253
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:18,263
Sweetie, you're home.

254
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:19,681
You see…

255
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,143
I bought a talisman for you.

256
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,562
Keep this with you,
and it'll grant you longevity.

257
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,695
Janggun told me.

258
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,115
You must've been shocked
to hear that I was dead.

259
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:41,912
It reminded me of that time
when you were very sick as a child.

260
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:46,625
Don't worry. I'm healthy now.

261
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:49,586
I'll live happily married to Taeyong

262
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,463
and have beautiful kids.

263
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,675
So you should live a long, healthy life.

264
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,593
I mean that.

265
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,304
Okay. I will, Yeojin.

266
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:35,924
Lee Seungcheon?

267
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:40,053
I was worried you had left already.
I'm glad you're still here.

268
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,016
What brings you here at this hour?

269
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,310
Well…

270
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,355
I thought long and hard about it,
and I think I owe you an apology.

271
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,903
I was talking nonsense last time
about a golden spoon.

272
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,656
I'm sorry about that.

273
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:02,951
As Oh Yeojin said, I must have said that

274
00:20:03,952 --> 00:20:05,621
because I envied you.

275
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:08,415
Right. And come to think of it,

276
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:11,168
that was a storyline
that I had come up with in high school.

277
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,087
I wanted to become
a webtoon artist like my dad.

278
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,635
Sure.

279
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,055
That'd be a good story for a webtoon.

280
00:20:24,139 --> 00:20:27,643
Right? So I'm going to do it.

281
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,187
Show it to me once you're done.
I can't wait.

282
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,314
I'd be grateful if you read it.

283
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,274
I'll be leaving now.

284
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,616
Lee Seungcheon.

285
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:47,412
You are

286
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,290
Lee Seungcheon.

287
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:53,669
And I'm Hwang Taeyong.

288
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,763
Based on my webtoon's plot.

289
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,810
I'll show it to you once I'm done.

290
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:26,660
You bastard. How dare you steal my life?

291
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,670
-What time is it?
-It's 9 p.m., sir.

292
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,134
Hwang Hyeondo.

293
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,804
And he's my father?

294
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,939
Maybe that's why

295
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:59,067
I feel at peace whenever I come here.

296
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,320
Juhee.

297
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,785
Will I feel at peace here as well?

298
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,446
Why is there a ghost in a church?

299
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,740
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

300
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,158
I'll come by more often.

301
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:03,423
-Ah.
-Na Juhee?

302
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,759
Hwang Taeyong.

303
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,052
Hey, Juhee.

304
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,846
What are you doing here?

305
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,640
Juhee, get up.

306
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,350
We meet again.

307
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:16,228
Hey, how much did you drink?

308
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,232
Just a tiny bit of makgeolli.

309
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:21,942
You reek.

310
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,528
Hey.

311
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,197
-A kitty.
-What?

312
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:29,032
Kitty!

313
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,799
You're such a good kitty
for staying still.

314
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:49,136
Do you want a snack?

315
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:53,473
I don't give this to just anyone.
It's pomegranate flavor.

316
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,474
Here.

317
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,102
A bite for me.

318
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,312
And a bite for you.

319
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,190
Mm.

320
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,820
Here.

321
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,613
Hmm.

322
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,158
Open up. No?

323
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,285
It must be full.

324
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,081
Come on. I'm Hwang Taeyong.

325
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,416
Open up.

326
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:23,712
Mmm.

327
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,843
It's good. Let's go home now.

328
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,386
Aah!

329
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,682
Let me go.

330
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,683
No.

331
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:51,364
Right. I need to go home.

332
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,117
-Home.
-Let's go.

333
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:57,871
That one too.

334
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,456
-This?
-Yes, that.

335
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:02,375
-Let's go.
-Okay.

336
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,586
Bye, kitty.

337
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,671
-Yes. Bye, kitty.
-Bye.

338
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:12,427
Feeling better now?

339
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:13,678
Yes.

340
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,223
-Do you want more water?
-Yes.

341
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,272
Why did you drink so much?

342
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,942
I missed my dad,

343
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,819
money,

344
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,073
and Seungcheon.

345
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:41,039
You have no idea
how big of a crush I had on him.

346
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:44,543
The day I first met him
at the convenience store,

347
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:49,297
my heart practically skipped a beat.

348
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:57,013
When will he turn around?

349
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,559
When will he talk to me?

350
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,061
When will he smile at me?

351
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,150
You should date him again
if you like him that much.

352
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,736
It seems like he likes you too.

353
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:12,946
Mm-mm.

354
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,074
The Seungcheon right now

355
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,369
isn't the one I fell in love with.

356
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,914
Lee Seungcheon has changed.

357
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,710
Of course, he's still such a great guy.

358
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:30,171
But he's not the same guy

359
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,758
I used to have a crush on.

360
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:38,680
Actually,

361
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:42,309
I was probably the one who changed.

362
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,233
BOOK OF SOLUTIONS

363
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,307
Hey.

364
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,519
What are those dogs for?

365
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:10,730
They're gifts for the police commissioner
regarding Seo Juntae's case.

366
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,651
How could they be considered gifts?

367
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,361
He enjoys hunting.

368
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,115
President Hwang
never sends people the same gift.

369
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,492
Pottery, jewelry,

370
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,453
or women.

371
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,041
He always sends gifts that befit them.

372
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,963
Gifts that fulfill their desires?

373
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:37,799
But how does he know?

374
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,301
That's enough. We're just errand boys.

375
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:42,679
Our duty is to deliver.

376
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,182
Don't try to understand.

377
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,560
Let's go.

378
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,897
Their desires
are only a disguise for what they lack.

379
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,985
Just like how people's appearances differ,

380
00:28:57,068 --> 00:29:00,155
there are various ways
they show what they lack.

381
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,031
-They're handsome.
-Do you like them?

382
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,408
-Hunting dogs.
-I do.

383
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,994
Pottery.

384
00:29:07,954 --> 00:29:08,997
Jewelry.

385
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,755
But in the end, only money
can satisfy what they lack.

386
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,933
This isn't what you truly want.

387
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:34,272
You want to pursue your long-lost dream
that you gave up because of money.

388
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,238
It's because of this pencil.

389
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,491
It's too low quality.

390
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,702
Honey, come eat.

391
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,537
Okay. I'm coming.

392
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,793
Seungcheon, you're having lunch
at home, right?

393
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,503
I'll make some kimchi stew.

394
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:57,629
That's okay.

395
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:00,590
I'm eating at a friend's house.

396
00:30:00,673 --> 00:30:03,551
Really? Who?

397
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:07,430
It's not like you know them all.
Stop asking.

398
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,518
I was just curious.

399
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,942
Have some meat too.

400
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,907
-Aren't these from Taeyong's?
-Yes.

401
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,742
Mmm.

402
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,327
It's delicious.

403
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:32,747
Seungcheon, did you know?

404
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,208
Our sales doubled thanks to Taeyong.

405
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,001
-Seriously?
-Yes.

406
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:38,753
You should treat him well.

407
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,463
We should have befriended him sooner.

408
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,927
Have some.

409
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,721
Wrap some rice with it.

410
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,891
Why do you keep giving me that?
I can eat it myself.

411
00:30:51,975 --> 00:30:53,101
I'm not a kid.

412
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,021
Darn it. I'm done eating.

413
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:00,775
What a rude prick!

414
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:03,862
Mom, just let him starve.

415
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,906
A scumbag like him deserves to.
How dare he?

416
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,993
Ignore him and just eat.

417
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,287
-Eat up.
-Okay.

418
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,574
Don't serve any meals?

419
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,743
No, not even a glass of water.

420
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:54,454
And no one is allowed
to enter this house without my permission.

421
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,372
Be it guests or friends.

422
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,711
Especially Lee Seungcheon.
He should never set foot in here.

423
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,296
Understood?

424
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:06,090
Yes, young master.

425
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:15,642
The last time I fed him
shouldn't be a problem, right?

426
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,107
You killed President Na? That's absurd.

427
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,567
You didn't.

428
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,155
It's true. I killed him.

429
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,158
Juntae, what's wrong with you?

430
00:32:32,241 --> 00:32:33,743
Do you think I'd fall for your lie?

431
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,954
Don't you remember
Taeyong's jacket that I got?

432
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:39,207
Taeyong killed him,
so why are you saying that you did it?

433
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:43,628
I know you. You would never commit murder.

434
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,131
You always see the good in me.

435
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,718
But that always frustrated me.

436
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:52,762
Quite a lot.

437
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:55,306
-Juntae.
-I killed him.

438
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:59,060
So drop it already.

439
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,728
No way.

440
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,731
He couldn't have.

441
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,929
Ma'am, I have something to tell you.

442
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,601
I thought I had lost it. Thanks.

443
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,937
You shouldn't drink that much.

444
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:48,818
You always smile
when you're having a hard time.

445
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:50,570
I do? When?

446
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,989
And I'm not having a hard time.

447
00:33:54,282 --> 00:33:55,241
Forget it.

448
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,618
Why were you at the church yesterday?

449
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,497
-What?
-You don't live nearby.

450
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:02,707
You're not a believer either.

451
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:09,672
I came to take you home.
You called me drunk.

452
00:34:10,465 --> 00:34:11,507
I did?

453
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,845
Darn it. I must've been crazy.
I should stop drinking.

454
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,055
Do you not remember?

455
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,016
Then do you remember
talking about Lee Seungcheon?

456
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,729
Even at our age, you're still so naive.

457
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:28,232
You still seem to be lost
in your first love fantasy.

458
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,235
Let me just say this.

459
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:34,447
The Lee Seungcheon
you used to like back in the day,

460
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:35,865
is a real bastard.

461
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:39,535
A jerk who only cares about money.
That's Lee Seungcheon.

462
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:45,458
Thanks for the coffee.
But I'll be going now.

463
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,918
Or else, I might get upset.

464
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:57,386
Hwang Taeyong, you jerk.

465
00:34:57,470 --> 00:35:00,515
You're the one
who only cares about money, not him.

466
00:35:00,848 --> 00:35:04,602
I know you're only appearing on TV
for the Dosin Hightech spin-off.

467
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:06,729
I know you want more shares
for your succession.

468
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:10,066
I can totally see through you,
so who are you calling a bastard?

469
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,734
Get your facts straight.

470
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:30,086
He's just ridiculous.

471
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,046
I shouldn't see him for the time being.

472
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,009
Going up. Door closing.

473
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,178
Door opening.

474
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,722
What? What do you want?

475
00:35:41,806 --> 00:35:44,517
Take good care of your stuff
if you don't want to see jerks like me.

476
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,357
-And Juhee.
-What is it this time?

477
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,401
Don't force a smile
when you're having a hard time.

478
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,610
You'll only exhaust yourself.

479
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:56,654
Door closing.

480
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,371
Seungcheon

481
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,957
used to say that.

482
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,216
-Hello?
-Hi, Taeyong.

483
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,926
I didn't get to say hi to you earlier.

484
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:21,345
Will you be coming home late?

485
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:22,513
What about dinner?

486
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,015
I'll eat outside.

487
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,392
Okay.

488
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:27,518
Goodbye.

489
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:31,272
What's with her?

490
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:51,125
I heard you ate at our place
last time as well.

491
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,377
Did you know?

492
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:57,256
Taeyong told them to never feed you.

493
00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:01,302
Isn't that strange?
Why would he say such a thing?

494
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,804
I thought you were friends.

495
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:06,057
You can ask him yourself.

496
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:09,685
Ah.

497
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,481
Judging by your rudeness,
I guess you two are friends.

498
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,274
Eat up.

499
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:33,834
What? Did you bring that spoon again?

500
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,879
You also brought that years ago.

501
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,987
How's your father?

502
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:06,534
Goodness. Why are you home so early?

503
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:08,786
I forgot something.

504
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,385
Hello, sir. I just stopped by.

505
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:27,096
I see. Take your time and enjoy the food.

506
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,642
Taeyong told us never to feed him.

507
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:16,479
And that boy is determined to eat here.

508
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,815
Aren't they just hilarious?

509
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,360
So immature.

510
00:39:23,903 --> 00:39:25,821
I detest that kid.

511
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,909
Lee Seungcheon, his family's side dishes,
and his family, they all disgust me. Why?

512
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:32,661
Because I can see through you.

513
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:37,875
You chose him over Juntae.

514
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,295
Do you think that worthless kid
could hold a candle to my Juntae?

515
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:44,340
I can see that
you have a lot on your mind.

516
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,092
However,

517
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,347
I do believe

518
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,141
I've already explained what you need to do

519
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,685
as Juntae's mother.

520
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:06,487
Goodness. I made a mistake.

521
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:11,659
After all, Juntae's fate is in your hands.

522
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,789
So of course, I should listen to you.

523
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,678
-The number you have dialed…
-I was told that

524
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,263
Lee Seungcheon ate at our house twice.

525
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,598
Why does he keep coming by
when you're away?

526
00:40:44,483 --> 00:40:45,609
LEE SEUNGCHEON

527
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,779
HWANG TAEYONG

528
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,322
I knew it.

529
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,909
The interview plays the most crucial role
in their recruitment.

530
00:40:57,413 --> 00:40:58,372
Right.

531
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:02,334
There are times
when you're arrogant for no reason.

532
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,087
You should drop that.
You should always be humble.

533
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,971
Dongkyung, I'm sorry to say this,
but I won't go to interviews anymore.

534
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,724
I see. Then what will you do?

535
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,518
Will you become an online streamer
or something?

536
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:21,854
I'm going to become rich.

537
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:26,025
Wealthier than you could ever imagine.

538
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,986
Don't bother job hunting.
I'll land you a position.

539
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,279
-A position?
-Yes.

540
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,156
My goodness.

541
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:35,451
What a bunch of nonsense.

542
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,703
Have you gone insane from being jobless?

543
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:39,497
Is that funny to you?

544
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,165
Jeez.

545
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:45,586
HWANG TAEYONG

546
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,088
The number you have dialed--

547
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,257
Hwang Taeyong.

548
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,676
So this is how you'll play?

549
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:58,891
SEUNGCHEON'S MOM

550
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:02,728
Uh…

551
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:05,397
Hello, ma'am. This is Taeyong.

552
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:09,235
Taeyong.

553
00:42:11,612 --> 00:42:13,280
I'm sorry for coming all of a sudden.

554
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,199
Seungcheon wasn't picking up.

555
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,785
I see. It must be something important.

556
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,328
Come in.

557
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:22,081
He just left to see Dongkyung off.

558
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:23,958
He'll be back soon. Come in.

559
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,043
Okay.

560
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,132
Goodness.

561
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,887
It's a mess, right?

562
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,889
Do understand.

563
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:40,349
It's okay.

564
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:44,311
I was preparing dinner.

565
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:48,983
-Have a seat, Taeyong.
-Okay.

566
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,326
Taeyong, come and eat.

567
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,832
You didn't have to.

568
00:43:49,084 --> 00:43:51,003
Mmm. It smells so good.

569
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,421
Sit down.

570
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:53,922
Dumpling soup.

571
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,091
Wow.

572
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,010
Thank you for the meal.

573
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,929
It's hot.

574
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:08,771
Mmm. Mom, your dumpling soup is the best.

575
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:10,648
How can it be this good?

576
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:13,734
What is it? Do you not like dumpling soup?

577
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:15,694
That's not why.

578
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:18,197
I…

579
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:22,701
I really like it.

580
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:24,453
Thank goodness.

581
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,041
Dumpling soup was Seungcheon's
favorite food growing up.

582
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,127
Then it suddenly changed to kimchi stew.

583
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:37,508
I made some
because he seemed to be troubled recently.

584
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,968
I'm glad you like it.

585
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,389
-Go on and eat.
-Okay.

586
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,943
Thank you for the meal.

587
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,904
-My pleasure.
-Mom, do we have a guest?

588
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:01,907
Yes, Seungcheon. It's Taeyong.

589
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,165
I came because you weren't picking up.

590
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,587
Mom, there's a new fritter joint nearby.

591
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,005
I know you like fritters.

592
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:21,051
Goodness. You're the best.

593
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,846
Don't give any to Dad or Sungah.
Have them all.

594
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:27,891
Thank you, my son. I'll enjoy them.

595
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:30,561
Gosh.

596
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:34,231
Taeyong. Are you leaving?

597
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,192
There's something I forgot to do.

598
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,903
I'm sorry I can't eat this.

599
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,321
Oh, dear.

600
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:44,825
Right. I heard you came by
our house to eat.

601
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,827
You should've told me.

602
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:49,455
Then I would've prepared
a nice meal for you.

603
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:55,002
I guess that didn't occur to me.

604
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:59,465
I'm free tomorrow. Do you want to come
and have lunch together?

605
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,719
Sure.

606
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:06,930
I should get going then.

607
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:08,265
All right.

608
00:46:10,184 --> 00:46:11,727
What should I do with this?

609
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,695
That's strange.

610
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:25,991
There's no record
of me calling him that night.

611
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:28,786
MS. WANG SOOMIN

612
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:30,746
Yes, Soomin.

613
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,625
Are you serious?

614
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,259
My goodness.

615
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:45,761
Over here!

616
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,889
Gosh. Let go already.

617
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:50,724
Jeez. Here.

618
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:56,897
Is it there?

619
00:46:58,106 --> 00:46:58,941
No?

620
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:04,905
Where did you get this suitcase?

621
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:07,491
Where's the money? Did you spend it all?

622
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:08,867
Of course, I did.

623
00:47:09,451 --> 00:47:11,829
There was only 500 million won.

624
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,625
I'm Geum Sukja,
the district councilor of Gangnam!

625
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:19,127
I don't deserve to be humiliated

626
00:47:19,211 --> 00:47:22,714
just for 500 million won.

627
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:25,175
Enough with your lies.

628
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,053
You'll be arrested
if the real Ms. Geum hears about this.

629
00:47:28,136 --> 00:47:31,306
How many times must I repeat myself?

630
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm the real Geum Sukja!

631
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:35,936
The one who's pretending to be me

632
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:39,439
was my former housekeeper!

633
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,735
Darn it. If only I had the golden spoon.

634
00:47:45,571 --> 00:47:46,572
Golden spoon?

635
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:49,825
What do you mean by that?

636
00:47:49,908 --> 00:47:54,413
You mean, a golden spoon that can
make you rich, or something like that?

637
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,791
Do you know about it?

638
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,420
Did you meet the golden spoon granny?

639
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:19,271
You're here.

640
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:33,702
Did you bring your golden spoon?

641
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,288
Of course.

642
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:59,937
Then let me see it. I'm curious.

643
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:21,833
You must desperately want to become rich.

644
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,004
If what you said is true,
by using that golden spoon,

645
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:28,799
you'll be abandoning your parents.
Will you be okay?

646
00:49:28,882 --> 00:49:32,177
You're the one who abandoned your parents.
I'm only going back to my rightful place.

647
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,930
I see.

648
00:49:36,014 --> 00:49:36,974
Is that right?

649
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:39,851
Then go on and eat.

650
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:44,523
But if you don't become Hwang Taeyong
by the end of this meal,

651
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,566
you'd better brace yourself.

652
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:55,033
Lee Seungcheon.

653
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:57,995
You're trying so hard.

654
00:49:59,204 --> 00:50:01,415
I know it's killing you deep down

655
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:05,210
to think I might actually use this.

656
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:10,257
Not at all.
I'm just worried about your parents.

657
00:50:10,966 --> 00:50:12,551
They trust you

658
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:15,679
and are proud of the man you've become.

659
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,806
-Don't you pity them?
-Shut up.

660
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,642
You have no right to talk about them.

661
00:50:24,271 --> 00:50:25,522
Eat up.

662
00:50:25,605 --> 00:50:27,816
Let's see if what you said is true.

663
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:29,901
Go on.

664
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:09,000
What was that? Why aren't you eating?

665
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,335
Why are you just leaving?

666
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:11,878
Let go, you bastard!

667
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:14,089
Go back in there and eat!

668
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:17,050
Why won't you eat?
Eat and become Hwang Taeyong!

669
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,010
Go eat.

670
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,971
No, I don't want to!

671
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:22,430
That's why you're here!

672
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,974
Then eat.

673
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:25,392
You can't just leave!

674
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:29,980
Why you…

675
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,026
Lee Seungcheon!

676
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:37,612
Don't be mistaken.

677
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:39,698
Do you know why I refuse to eat?

678
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,993
Because I don't want to lose

679
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,370
the best parents…

680
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,915
in the world.

681
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:53,545
Are you happy
that you abandoned them to become rich?

682
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,173
In that case,

683
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,884
you can be Hwang Taeyong.

684
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,429
And I'll live as Lee Seungcheon.

685
00:53:51,937 --> 00:53:52,812
Mom.

686
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:54,940
Yes, it's me.

687
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:59,069
Seungcheon.
Thank you so much for being alive.

688
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,154
Seungcheon, you're okay.

689
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,739
Look at me.

690
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:04,532
Follow me.

691
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:06,660
Inhale.

692
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,578
Exhale.

693
00:54:09,871 --> 00:54:10,705
Inhale.

694
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:12,916
Exhale.

695
00:54:15,543 --> 00:54:18,505
-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

696
00:54:18,588 --> 00:54:21,216
-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
-♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

697
00:54:21,299 --> 00:54:25,553
-♪ Happy birthday, dear my son ♪
-♪ Happy birthday, dear Seungcheon ♪

698
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,973
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

699
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:39,109
-Salute!
-Salute!

700
00:54:40,318 --> 00:54:42,404
I'd like to declare that
Sergeant Lee Seungcheon,

701
00:54:42,487 --> 00:54:45,156
has been discharged
from the army on July 6, 2016.

702
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:47,701
This is my declaration. Salute!

703
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,994
Salute.

704
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:52,539
-Mom!
-My son!

705
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:56,251
-You worked so hard.
-I'm finally discharged!

706
00:55:00,922 --> 00:55:02,716
MOM

707
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,512
MOM

708
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:09,431
Hi, Mom.

709
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:12,809
Seungcheon, what's with your voice?

710
00:55:13,435 --> 00:55:14,853
Did you catch a cold?

711
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,272
No, I'm okay.

712
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:21,067
What is it?

713
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:25,947
Well, I just called to ask
if you were craving anything for dinner.

714
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:34,497
Mom, I'd like…

715
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:39,044
some kimchi stew.

716
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:45,425
I want some kimchi stew
with a lot of pork.

717
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,680
That's all I need, Mom.

718
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:18,875
Taeyong, what's wrong?

719
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,298
Taeyong.

720
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:31,763
Yeojin.

721
00:56:34,432 --> 00:56:35,558
I lost.

722
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:39,104
I'm no match…

723
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,440
for Hwang Taeyong.

724
00:56:45,485 --> 00:56:46,903
Did something happen?

725
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:52,158
Don't tell me he met the old woman too.

726
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:57,288
He had a golden spoon.

727
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:00,667
But Yeojin.

728
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:04,003
Do you know what I did to him today?

729
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:08,299
I stole his golden spoon…

730
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,887
and swapped it with a fake one.

731
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,642
I didn't want him to become Hwang Taeyong.

732
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,229
I…

733
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,025
I didn't want to return
to being Lee Seungcheon again.

734
00:57:29,028 --> 00:57:30,363
But that punk…

735
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,286
chose

736
00:57:37,912 --> 00:57:39,122
my parents instead.

737
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,467
I thought he'd use the golden spoon too.

738
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:56,264
I thought he'd choose money
over his parents.

739
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,144
I'm a piece of trash.

740
00:58:06,441 --> 00:58:09,110
Let's say that you are. So what?

741
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,863
It wasn't our fault
that our families were poor.

742
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:15,033
We had no money,
so we wanted to become rich.

743
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:17,619
We only seized an opportunity.

744
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:22,165
Anyone would have done the same
had they met that old woman.

745
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:23,416
But…

746
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,296
But Hwang Taeyong chose not to.

747
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:33,176
Don't be in pain.

748
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,471
You're killing me.

749
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:41,226
I wasn't lonely

750
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,187
because I had you,
someone who was just like me.

751
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:52,445
I don't care if the world criticizes me.

752
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:54,239
You're all that I need.

753
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:57,909
So can't you do the same?

754
00:59:01,079 --> 00:59:03,456
We have nowhere to return to.

755
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,132
No.

756
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,884
Yeojin.

757
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,180
This isn't right. I'm sorry.

758
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:05,184
Seungcheon.

759
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:24,787
The golden spoon lets you swap parents.

760
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:27,206
Haven't you heard the story
about a golden spoon

761
01:00:27,999 --> 01:00:29,042
that can swap your parents?

762
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,171
It's the same golden spoon story
as Seungcheon's.

763
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,299
I picked it up.
In the classroom back in high school.

764
01:00:36,883 --> 01:00:38,134
You still have what I got you.

765
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:41,137
Don't force a smile
when you're having a hard time.

766
01:00:41,763 --> 01:00:42,889
You'll only exhaust yourself.

767
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,515
Door closing.

768
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:53,149
Could Taeyong be Seungcheon?

769
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,614
That's absurd.

770
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:11,793
Hwang Taeyong.

771
01:01:24,472 --> 01:01:26,599
-Taeyong.
-I came because I missed you.

772
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:30,061
I missed you so much, Juhee.

773
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:42,073
Are you…

774
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:45,159
Seungcheon?

775
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,104
You are, aren't you?

776
01:02:19,026 --> 01:02:19,861
No.

777
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:24,198
I'm Hwang Taeyong.

778
01:02:52,685 --> 01:02:54,437
PERSONAL INFORMATION
NAME: JEONG EUINAM

779
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:57,273
"Jeong Euinam. Eight priors…"

780
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,317
Eight?

781
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:01,611
Theft, theft, theft.

782
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,070
Assault. Housebreaking.

783
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:06,574
"Incarcerated in Seoul Dongbu Penitentiary
for assault."

784
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:09,702
He's one heinous bastard.

785
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:14,207
So why has Yeojin been sending him money?

786
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:16,125
Mm?

787
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,713
Look at this lousy scumbag.

788
01:03:45,404 --> 01:03:48,574
You look good in beige.

789
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:52,995
I can't believe I'm visiting you here.

790
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:56,290
This is one strong friendship.
Don't you think?

791
01:03:57,208 --> 01:03:58,668
I'll make sure

792
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,546
to repay you for that.

793
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:08,219
So how can you possibly
help us make money behind bars?

794
01:04:09,053 --> 01:04:10,054
Dosin Hightech.

795
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:12,473
They'll sell short.

796
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:18,354
I knew it. He's just full of lies.

797
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:23,442
Their stock price is soaring
due to the spin-off.

798
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:25,820
-That's impossible.
-It'll be a physical division.

799
01:04:25,903 --> 01:04:27,905
-What?
-Really?

800
01:04:27,989 --> 01:04:29,740
Taeyong doesn't know his father too well.

801
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:33,995
But I do.

802
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:36,247
Hwang Hyeondo…

803
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:40,084
will choose physical division instead.

804
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,261
Put the young master's birthday gifts
on the table.

805
01:05:00,396 --> 01:05:02,732
The stocks keep dropping
with news of the physical division.

806
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,191
Did you check the loan balance?

807
01:05:04,275 --> 01:05:06,903
The majority are short selling.
What should we do?

808
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,696
-Where's Father?
-He's in his study--

809
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,907
Get the car ready.
I'll go right after meeting Father.

810
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:11,824
Yes, sir.

811
01:05:22,835 --> 01:05:23,669
Lee Seungcheon.

812
01:05:28,215 --> 01:05:29,258
Why are you here?

813
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:31,469
To deliver the side dishes.

814
01:05:31,552 --> 01:05:32,887
Side dishes?

815
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:35,973
I'll be making the deliveries here
from now on.

816
01:05:36,641 --> 01:05:38,100
I don't want my parents

817
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,353
to meet you.

818
01:05:42,021 --> 01:05:44,815
If you meet your real parents
on your birthday,

819
01:05:44,899 --> 01:05:47,485
you'll go back
to being your original selves.

820
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:53,407
Hey, you shouldn't be here.
Leave right now.

821
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:57,662
What's wrong with you?
I need to drop these off.

822
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:59,246
Just put them down and leave.

823
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,373
What's with you?

SUCCESS AFTER SUCCESS
SIDE DISH STORE

825
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:05,711
Taeyong.

826
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:12,385
Do we have a guest?

827
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:15,596
Father.

828
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,852
Lee Seungcheon?

829
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:46,335
It was you,

830
01:06:47,211 --> 01:06:48,212
Lee Seungcheon.

831
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,429
We didn't switch. What's going on?

832
01:06:57,972 --> 01:07:01,308
Once you guys are done talking,
come see me, Taeyong.

833
01:07:02,476 --> 01:07:03,519
Okay.

834
01:07:08,482 --> 01:07:09,900
What went wrong?

835
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:12,737
We should've been switched.

836
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:17,742
Don't tell me the old woman lied.

837
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:19,118
Seungcheon.

838
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:29,962
Jeez. Why did you--

839
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:33,507
Hello, President Hwang.

840
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:38,095
My wife made some dumplings
for Taeyong's birthday. You forgot them.

841
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,682
Here, Seungcheon.

842
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,560
Let me be Hwang Taeyong again.

843
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,771
You're Taeyong, aren't you?

844
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:29,897
I can't believe it.

845
01:08:29,980 --> 01:08:31,899
Are you back to being Lee Seungcheon?

846
01:08:32,399 --> 01:08:34,235
I remember that scene.

847
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:37,154
President Hwang
isn't Taeyong's biological father?

848
01:08:37,822 --> 01:08:40,282
Your last chance,
there isn't much time left, right?

849
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,535
Do you think I'll just sit here
and take it?

850
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:43,869
But aren't you curious

851
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:46,372
about what your son, Lee Seungcheon did?

852
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:47,498
I'm asking you, Seungcheon.

853
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:49,041
Please don't become Hwang Taeyong.
