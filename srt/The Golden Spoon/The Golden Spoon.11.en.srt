00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,947
THE GOLDEN SPOON

2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,324
Why do you have this?

3
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:36,745
I gave this to Seungcheon.
Why do you have it?

4
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,996
I picked it up.

5
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:39,998
In the classroom back in high school.

6
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:45,003
Because I had a crush on you at that time.

7
00:00:49,507 --> 00:00:52,510
Now tell me. How did you unlock this?

8
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,239
What are you doing?

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,575
Taking a selfie.

10
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,869
I'm going to let Taeyong know
that I'm eating with you.

11
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:21,664
Why did you suddenly want to eat with me?

12
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:23,666
Hey, do you know why

13
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,294
Juhee approached Taeyong?

14
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:29,089
So what?

15
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,009
Are you trying to say
that she has feelings for him?

16
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,222
You don't know anything, do you?

17
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:38,139
What don't I know?

18
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,810
About a woman's heart.

19
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,687
Anyone can tell Taeyong is charming.

20
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:46,606
Why don't you keep a tight rein on her?

21
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:50,026
Oh Yeojin, why don't you take care
of Hwang Taeyong yourself?

22
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,028
Don't drag other people
into your love quarrel.

23
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:59,828
I don't think I want
to have a meal on you.

24
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:01,538
It's all yours.

25
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,327
You are

26
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,747
too fearless.

27
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:47,333
I can do anything to reveal the truth
behind my dad's death.

28
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:50,336
Tell me. Why are you after that case?

29
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,297
Just why?

30
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,217
You probably won't believe me,

31
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,345
but I've been after the culprit too.

32
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,680
What?

33
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,310
4 UNREAD MESSAGES
OH YEOJIN

34
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:17,697
There's a rule about the golden
spoon that you don't know about.

35
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:18,865
Don't you want to know?

36
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,497
What's wrong?

37
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,585
I need to go. We'll talk later.

BOOK OF SOLUTIONS

39
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,763
EPISODE 11

40
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,392
You came sooner than I thought.

41
00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:48,269
Why did you send me this picture?

42
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,688
And what's the golden spoon's rule
that I don't know about?

43
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,858
I guess you really were curious.

44
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:55,652
Fine, I'll tell you.

45
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:58,404
If someone eats with your golden spoon,

46
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,949
that person will gain your memory.

47
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:02,533
That you are Lee Seungcheon,

48
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,994
and that you swapped parents, everything.

49
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:07,413
Don't tell me you--

50
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:10,583
Don't worry. I didn't use it this time.

51
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,672
But if you keep seeing Juhee…

52
00:04:19,008 --> 00:04:21,761
Guess who will be most shocked
if they find out about what you did.

53
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,223
Na Juhee? Hwang Taeyong?

54
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,225
President Hwang?

55
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,394
Ah.

56
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,312
Your parents?

57
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,529
You dare to do that,
and you're going to lose everything.

58
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,574
Dosin, me, and your life. Everything.

59
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,244
You don't think I can do it?

60
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,496
How dare you threaten me?

61
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:51,207
As long as I have your golden spoon,
I have the upper hand.

62
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,250
We aren't partners.

63
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,548
Good. Now that sounds like you.

64
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,926
I got worried
in case you had feelings for me.

65
00:05:03,886 --> 00:05:06,973
Okay, I'll behave accordingly from now on.

66
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:10,101
That will do, right?

67
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,700
Na Juhee came to film

68
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:27,994
here?

69
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,705
She's making a bold move.

70
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:33,374
Juntae, don't do anything.

71
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,793
Hyeondo told you to stay low.

72
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:39,088
Okay, fine. I won't do anything.

73
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:45,053
-Satisfied?
-Oh, right.

74
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:49,182
Juntae, take a look at this.

75
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,438
She's the second child of Seoyoung Group.

76
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,148
She majored in vocal performance in Italy.

77
00:05:57,774 --> 00:05:59,442
She has a mild personality.

78
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,652
And look how pretty she is.

79
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,239
I'll think about it
since you're recommending her.

80
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:07,742
But I doubt
any woman will be as good as you.

81
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,082
Hmm…

82
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:20,213
The strongest motivation
that drives people to earn money

83
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,714
is blood.

84
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,091
Blood-related family, I mean.

85
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:27,929
So make sure to get married
and have children.

86
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,140
So you can leave your money to them.

87
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,350
What about you?

88
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,228
Why didn't you have a child with Hyeondo?

89
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,899
Was he against it because of Taeyong?

90
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:45,321
Perhaps he didn't want his child
to have the Seo family blood.

91
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:48,032
I never know what he's thinking.

92
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:49,409
He can't be trusted.

93
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,624
You are the only one

94
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,960
I trust.

95
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,171
Everyone else around me
tries to make use of me

96
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,673
and tells lies.

97
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:08,177
But you never lie to me.

98
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:15,101
This is comfortable.
Let me take a nap here.

Who is it?

114
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,832
Juhee, it's me.

115
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,175
You startled me.

116
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,888
I was passing by and thought of you.

117
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,226
By the way,

118
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,479
isn't this like ten years old?

119
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:24,981
You're still using it.

120
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,816
I carry that everywhere.

121
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,068
Especially when I interview rough people.

122
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,958
COULD HWANG TAEYONG BE THE CULPRIT…?

123
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,669
What is this about?
Hwang Taeyong is the culprit?

124
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,477
Should I tell her about Seo Juntae?

125
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:13,237
NA SANGGUK CASE REPORT

126
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,822
COULD HWANG TAEYONG BE THE CULPRIT…?

127
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:17,617
Why are you telling me this now?
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

128
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,118
Because I knew

129
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,580
you'd give your all to help me.

130
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,750
I didn't want to cause you trouble.

131
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,170
Juhee, even so.
For such a long time, you--

132
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,088
That wasn't hard at all.

133
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,549
But now, it's a little hard.

134
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,261
All these years, I've thought
that Taeyong was the culprit.

135
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:41,098
I'm taken aback to think
that he may not be.

136
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:46,687
If that's the case,
I'll have to start all over again.

137
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:50,274
And that feels frustrating
and I don't know what to do.

138
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,747
Don't worry, Juhee.
You're not alone anymore.

139
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,959
I will never leave you alone.

140
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:10,878
I'll be with you.

141
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,697
Why did you suddenly
want to see me at this hour?

142
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,454
You bastard. It was you, wasn't it?

143
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,915
You killed President Na, didn't you?
You horrible bastard!

144
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:53,838
-It wasn't me.
-Don't give me that crap.

145
00:11:53,921 --> 00:11:56,048
Whether you killed him or not,

146
00:11:56,549 --> 00:12:00,094
it's true that Dosin…
Your dad concealed it all.

147
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,388
Tell me if I'm wrong.

148
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:05,433
Yes, you're right.

149
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,644
My father is a frightening man.

150
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,356
So if you truly want to help Juhee…

151
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:18,529
…you'd better not do anything
like this again.

152
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:24,910
Hwang Taeyong!

153
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:32,501
Listen carefully.

154
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:36,464
If you really are not the culprit,
I will help you.

155
00:12:41,302 --> 00:12:42,636
But

156
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,639
if you are the culprit,

157
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:48,476
I will kill you.

158
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,747
Did Hwang Taeyong really

159
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,542
kill President Na?

00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:03,717
I feel like I had a golden spoon before.

166
00:14:06,387 --> 00:14:07,638
Where did it go?

167
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,021
Hold on.

168
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,357
This is mine. It's my golden spoon.

169
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,734
Hwang Taeyong had a golden spoon too.

170
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,910
No way. Did this really happen?

171
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:36,000
A physical division isn't something

172
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,668
you can decide on your own.

173
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:39,420
If you really want the equity spinoff,

174
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,673
prepare grounds to convince
the executives and directors.

175
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,466
Sure, I will do that.

176
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,636
But remember. I have the final say.

177
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:49,346
One more thing.

178
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,352
Don't ever see Juhee again
after the interview.

179
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,814
-Do you know what I mean?
-Yes.

180
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,484
And let me apologize.

181
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,488
I was rude on the day
we had dinner with Seungcheon's family.

182
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,033
I'm sorry.

183
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:16,373
There's no need to apologize.

184
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,168
I learned something too.

185
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:24,214
I didn't know you were that envious
of Lee Seungcheon's family.

186
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,508
If that's how my son feels,

187
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:28,928
I'll respect it.

188
00:15:43,859 --> 00:15:45,569
Respect it?

189
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:48,989
What does that mean?

190
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,500
DOSIN GROUP PRESIDENT HWANG HYEONDO

191
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,384
Poverty is…

192
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,010
It's not contagious.

193
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,054
He dares to lecture me?

194
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:32,491
Wow.

195
00:16:33,325 --> 00:16:34,493
How nice.

196
00:16:34,576 --> 00:16:35,828
-Honey.
-Yes?

197
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:39,289
Are you sure we have the right house?

198
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,250
I wonder who lives here.

199
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,584
Hello.

200
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,253
-Yes, hello.
-Hello.

201
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:48,966
MAY 2011, JUNE 2012
ANOTHER CHANCE, D-5

202
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,391
If this is true…

203
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:00,686
LEE SEUNGCHEON, HWANG TAEYONG
SWAP YOUR PARENTS WITH YOUR FRIEND'S!!!

204
00:17:04,189 --> 00:17:05,691
I was Hwang Taeyong?

205
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,443
That means,

206
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:10,904
I might have killed President Na.

207
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,491
No.

208
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,535
What am I thinking?

209
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:21,373
SEOUL JEIL HIGH 3-2
LEE SEUNGCHEON

210
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,458
It can't be true.

211
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,800
Hello?

212
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,469
Who are you?

213
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:36,805
The Dosin Group president's office?

214
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:40,976
Mmm. These look so good.

215
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:47,608
The president wants to apologize
for what happened the other day.

216
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,109
Gosh, not at all.

217
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,736
We felt bad,

218
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:54,740
and it's not easy
to prepare meals for our staff.

219
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,618
So we'll be ordering side dishes
from you from now on.

220
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:00,037
There's no need to do that.

221
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,915
Oh, no. If you decline,
I'll be put in a tight spot.

222
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:05,918
The president was adamant I do this.

223
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:08,796
And he prepared some gifts for you.

224
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:11,548
Ms. Gong, load the gifts in their car.

225
00:18:11,632 --> 00:18:12,883
Yes, ma'am.

226
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,095
Gosh, but we're okay.

227
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:19,306
-Shall we?
-Sure.

228
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,360
We will be leaving then.

229
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,787
Honey?

230
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,252
This…

231
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:50,504
May I open it?

232
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:52,965
Thank you.

233
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,856
It's part of my husband's collection.

234
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:12,651
It's an artist box
made by a designer named Karl Hartmann.

235
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,653
There's nothing special to the box.

236
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:17,406
It just has some common writing materials.

237
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,200
These are not just any writing materials.

238
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,912
They were made with petrified wood
lithified for more than 200 million years.

239
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,749
All the renowned artists use these.

240
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:30,335
How do you know so well?

241
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:33,046
I saw it at an exhibition back in college.

242
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,673
Ah,

243
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,133
We'll be on our way now.

244
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:37,926
Yes.

245
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,229
Put this where he can see it.

246
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:52,941
What has gotten into him?

247
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,835
That painting is upside down.

248
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:18,425
You're right.

249
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,185
Was it when Taeyong was ten?

250
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:32,231
He said this painting was boring
and hung it upside down.

251
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,692
I'm surprised you noticed it.
You have a sharp eye.

252
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:39,279
My dad used to draw.

253
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:41,323
It's all thanks to him.

254
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,575
I guess you love him dearly.

255
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:49,748
Let me ask you a question first.

256
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,043
Why did Taeyong suddenly leave
for the States ten years ago?

257
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:56,922
What was so important
that he gave up on college to leave?

258
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,596
Big fish

259
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,641
must live in big water to grow.

260
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,398
Why do you ask, all of a sudden?

261
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:15,440
Uh…

262
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,360
I wondered if something bad had happened.

263
00:21:18,443 --> 00:21:21,822
I guess people
really do need to live in the big world.

264
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,949
Taeyong came back a successful man.

265
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,576
If you want to be like him, join Dosin.

266
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,246
I'd like you to help Taeyong here.

267
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,917
You won't just be an ordinary clerk.

268
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,547
You will reach the highest point
a salaryman can go.

269
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,464
I promise you that.

270
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,135
Why are you making me such an offer?

271
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:45,012
Taeyong seems

272
00:21:45,929 --> 00:21:48,265
to care dearly about

273
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,350
you and your family.

274
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,769
Let bygones be bygones,

275
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:55,647
and think carefully about my offer.

276
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,366
Why me, of all people?

277
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:25,010
Ah, Mr. Kim
from the Planning and Development Team.

278
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,095
This is Hwang Taeyong.
Please give him a lot of help.

279
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:28,055
Welcome.

280
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:30,265
This is the Telemarketing Team…

281
00:22:31,058 --> 00:22:32,059
Thanks for your hard work.

282
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,727
I put him in your care.

283
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:42,402
You will be working with those people.

284
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,488
Yes, Father.

285
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,889
Do you want to be
Hwang Hyeondo's son or what?

286
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,101
Wake up, Lee Seungcheon.

287
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,156
Why did he suddenly ask me
about sending Taeyong to the States?

288
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:34,496
Sir, Seo Juntae is off
to meet Na Juhee again.

289
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,457
Right.

290
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,086
He just can't stay low.

291
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:44,714
What do you mean, open a bar?
You just came back from the Philippines.

292
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:48,552
Sanggu.

293
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,680
Don't cause any trouble and behave.

294
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:55,350
Okay.

295
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,897
Where were we?

296
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:05,735
I'm preparing a story on my dad's case.

297
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,487
Could you let me interview you?

298
00:24:07,571 --> 00:24:10,073
With my face blurred
and my voice distorted?

299
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,741
Are you kidding me?

300
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,577
I can't do that.

301
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:16,538
Right? I thought you might say that.

302
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,709
Goodness, it's hot.

303
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:22,586
Maybe the AC is broken.

304
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:28,758
What's wrong?

305
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,178
Oh, right.

306
00:24:32,179 --> 00:24:35,640
Your childhood nickname was Mr. Smile.

307
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:37,267
You know that?

308
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,604
-Did you do a background check on me?
-Not at all.

309
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,899
I was once Taeyong's fiancée.
Of course I'd know that.

310
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:48,320
But I heard you cried easily
unlike your nickname.

311
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:50,864
Who told you that?

312
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:52,991
Seongwon?

313
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,453
You were quite famous among those
who went to St. Jerome School.

314
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,079
That you were unexpectedly sensitive.

315
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:02,667
And that you struggled a lot
as you studied abroad at a young age

316
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,002
after your parents died.

317
00:25:07,589 --> 00:25:08,632
That's right.

318
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,593
But didn't you hear this?

319
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:17,891
That whoever called me Mr. Smile
had to pay the price.

320
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,977
Hwang Taeyong was the timid crybaby,
not me.

321
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,438
I don't know what you heard from whom,

322
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:26,608
but don't run your mouth like this.
Do you get it?

323
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:29,945
Let her go right now.

324
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,988
Or you're dead.

325
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,740
Okay, I will.

326
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,868
There.

327
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:05,355
Taeyong, let's go.

328
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:12,654
What's with them?

329
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,990
Did they team up already?

330
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:19,953
Are you okay?

331
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,915
How did you know to come here?
Have you been watching me?

332
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,960
I was watching Seo Juntae, not you.

333
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,795
Do you even know how dangerous he is?

334
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,464
What do you mean, he's dangerous?

335
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:33,675
Can't you tell from your experience today?

336
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,761
Anyway, don't ever meet him again.

337
00:26:38,221 --> 00:26:39,222
Are you perhaps

338
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,059
suspecting that he killed my dad?

339
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,815
Taeyong did? All right.

340
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,569
Keep watching Juntae and Na Juhee closely.

341
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:14,799
Lee Seungcheon's parents came by earlier.

342
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:19,971
How was it seeing them after a long time?

343
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:24,059
Well, they were poor, kind-hearted,

344
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:25,894
and humble.

345
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:28,104
People like them are obvious.

346
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:30,357
They aren't humble at all.

347
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,775
They're very arrogant.

348
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,987
They never agree to take money,
designer goods, or even an apartment.

349
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,949
They value their petty sense of pride
more than money.

350
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:46,206
Then why did you tell me
to be good to them?

351
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,127
I wanted to teach them.

352
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:55,423
That poverty is hardly contagious,
but wealth is…

353
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,469
Money is easily contagious.

354
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:02,347
I'm going to help them realize it.

355
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,441
Gosh, what is all this?

356
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:15,652
The artist box.

357
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:18,363
It was 25 million won
when I saw it at the exhibition.

358
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:22,075
I wonder how much it is now.
More than 30 years have passed.

359
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,577
I bet it's worth more than 100 million.

360
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:25,912
Mmm.

361
00:28:26,871 --> 00:28:30,625
Prime fruit is different indeed.
It's amazing.

362
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,294
Dad, what are you doing? Try it.

363
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,590
-Why is it so good?
-It's no joke, right?

364
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:39,843
What on earth?

365
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:41,553
This is just too good.

366
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:43,972
-There's one more box?
-Wow!

367
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:46,433
Mmm!

368
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:49,519
I wonder if it's okay
to take these expensive gifts.

369
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:52,397
Yes, it is.
These don't even cost much to them.

370
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,109
Money is valuable
both for the poor and the rich.

371
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,528
The rich value their money just as we do.

372
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,364
And nothing is for free.

373
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,074
Everything comes with a price.

374
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:07,495
Mom, we've paid the price.

375
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,414
This is them showing off
how rich they are.

376
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,292
And think about what they did
to Seungcheon before.

377
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:14,961
This is by no means free.

378
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,839
Honey, try one. It's to die for.

379
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,340
-Gosh.
-Come on.

380
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,595
Anyway, why isn't our son coming home?

381
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,555
He said he had something to do.

382
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:30,393
NEW JERSEY IN SHOCK

383
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:31,853
"ST. JEROME SCHOOL SHOOTING,
THE WITNESS WAS A KOREAN STUDENT"

384
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:36,399
Just like how he framed me
for St. Jerome's shooting case,

385
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,693
he framed me for President Na's case.

386
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,320
Seo Juntae's the culprit.

387
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:50,079
That's what you claim.
How are we supposed to believe you?

388
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,040
You met President Na on the day he died.

389
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,209
Isn't that true?

390
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:57,712
Why did you meet my dad that day?

391
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,256
Well…

392
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:04,594
I don't remember.

393
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,723
You don't remember?

394
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:11,142
Hwang Taeyong, do you think
that makes sense?

395
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,103
Juhee, you know I took medication
for a long time, right?

396
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:17,273
And that I had a dissociative disorder
because of the shooting case.

397
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:20,026
That's why I don't remember that day.

398
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,695
But one thing is for sure. I'm a witness.

399
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,323
Do you have evidence to prove it?

400
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,617
Yes, a jacket that had
President Na's bloodstain on it.

401
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,578
Seo Juntae struck a deal
with my father using the jacket.

402
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,455
It probably doesn't exist anymore.

403
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,082
My father must have gotten rid of it.

404
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:35,708
Seo Juntae said

405
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:38,586
that was crucial evidence
to prove you were the murderer.

406
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,382
It can prove that he was there,

407
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,510
but it can't prove
that he murdered your father.

408
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,684
BURNER PHONE?

409
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,686
Did you check this number?

410
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,479
No, it was a burner phone.

411
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:58,147
It was Seo Juntae.

412
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,899
The last person who called President Na.

413
00:31:01,234 --> 00:31:04,404
Seo Juntae definitely met
with President Na that day.

414
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:06,906
And I'm looking for the person
who works for him to prove it.

415
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:12,537
I already said I didn't have such a thing!

416
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,415
Why are you bothering me
with that security footage nonsense?

417
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,835
Fine, I'll make
an official interview request then.

418
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,504
Darn it! I'm not doing
another one of those interviews.

419
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,715
Hey, miss. Knock it off.

420
00:31:23,798 --> 00:31:27,343
Even if you search the entire country,
you can't find footage from ten years ago.

421
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,762
Yes, you're right.

422
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:32,473
Footage from ten years ago?

423
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,731
Oh Dongpil is here to set a wedding date

424
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,482
for his daughter, Oh Yeojin.

425
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:46,446
Please help him avoid unlucky dates
and decide on a good date…

426
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:49,365
She's been shaking those bells
for too long.

427
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:50,617
You sure she's good?

428
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:55,246
They say she's the best
at reading marital compatibility.

429
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,041
What compatibility?
I just need to set a date.

430
00:31:58,124 --> 00:32:00,835
Who knows? I mean,
Yeojin's future is on the line.

431
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,629
Right.

432
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,971
Is this about Oh Yeojin,
born in the Year of the Water Rooster?

433
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,600
You're here to set her wedding date?

434
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,517
Yes.

435
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:21,272
My daughter is marrying
the richest man in the country.

436
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:23,524
You wicked thing!

437
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,153
How dare you lie to the spirit?

438
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,988
What are you talking about?

439
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,073
He's not lying.

440
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:35,995
You no longer have a daughter.
Your daughter is dead!

441
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,290
The spirit is saying she died
more than ten years ago.

442
00:32:39,374 --> 00:32:41,042
How dare you!

443
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,421
How frustrating.

444
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,840
Dear spirit. This is frustrating.

445
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:57,225
This is how you use it.

446
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,894
It's important to manage
your skin elasticity as you age.

447
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,355
And I make everything thoroughly.

448
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:03,856
Yes, we know.

449
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,693
We'll prepare to hold
the launching show live online.

450
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:09,904
Ms. Oh, don't tell me you will retire
because you're going to be

451
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,572
the young lady of Dosin.

452
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:13,741
No way.

453
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:15,368
Of course, she won't.

454
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:21,249
Yeojin is much better
at running a business than me.

455
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,583
I need her to bring me money.

456
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,336
What are you doing here unnoticed?

457
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:28,131
To give you some snacks, my Yeojin.

458
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:30,633
Munki?

459
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,098
Hoping that you'll take good care
of my fiancée, I prepared these gifts…

460
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:39,517
Actually, bribes for you.

461
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:40,768
Bribes…

462
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,062
Thank you.

463
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,189
I'll leave you to work then.

464
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:47,233
Goodbye.

465
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:50,903
Excuse me for a bit.

466
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:54,323
-He's so handsome.
-I know!

467
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:57,994
-Well…
-Gosh, thank you.

468
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,835
Giving flowers
and acting like a sweet fiancé.

469
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:09,297
This is unexpected. You sounded like
you'd never see me again the other day.

470
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:13,342
You need me, and I need you too.

471
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,303
That's what our relationship is.

472
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,307
My meeting will end soon, so wait.

473
00:34:19,390 --> 00:34:22,435
I booked a table at a nice restaurant.
Let's have dinner together.

474
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,189
I think I've done more than my share.

475
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:33,071
I need to go because I have plans.
I'll see you later.

476
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:39,535
It was so hard to make that reservation.

477
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,288
Jerk.

478
00:34:52,006 --> 00:34:55,009
Park Sanggu changed his name
after returning from the Philippines.

479
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,677
So it took a while to find him.

480
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,853
It's true that I got him
that burner phone,

481
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,147
but I know nothing.

482
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:11,150
But you're sure that Seo Juntae
was to meet President Na that day, yes?

483
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:14,946
I told you so… Sir.

484
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:17,073
Maybe he argued with President Na.

485
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,992
After he hung up, he smashed everything

486
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:21,369
and said he'd kill him.

487
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:24,288
He was like a crazy dog… Sir.

488
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:35,007
You're going to testify what you just said
when I need you to.

489
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:38,511
Young master, wait.

490
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:42,431
You're definitely protecting me
from Seo Juntae, right?

491
00:35:42,515 --> 00:35:44,183
Or he will kill me.

492
00:35:44,267 --> 00:35:47,186
Don't you watch the news?
Seo Juntae lost his power in Dosin.

493
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:54,902
Would you trust
Hwang Hyeondo's brother-in-law

494
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:56,279
or his son?

495
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,957
These are the records of the cases

496
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,794
that broke out within 3 km of your house
on the day of the incident.

497
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,882
To get my hand on these,
I sent official requests here and there

498
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:19,427
and begged all the screenwriters
and detectives I knew.

500
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,769
GANGNAM POLICE STATION

501
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:32,607
Soomin, thank you so much.

502
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,695
By the way, I'm surprised
Seungcheon thought of this idea.

503
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,363
He's brilliant.

504
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:40,990
When I worked at the convenience store,

505
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:43,075
there was an assault case nearby.

506
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,870
The police took all the security footage.

507
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,664
The dash cam footage too.

508
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:52,251
No one would keep footage
from ten years ago,

509
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:55,963
but the case records might still exist.

510
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:59,008
But they doubted you'd find anything.

511
00:37:01,510 --> 00:37:04,347
Even so, I have to do the best I can.

512
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,350
Okay. Take a look.

513
00:37:26,118 --> 00:37:27,286
Juhee.

514
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,457
A princess shouldn't live
in a shabby place like this.

WHO IS?
CEO SEO JUNTAE OF DOSIN HIGHTECH

521
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,691
They did their research.

522
00:39:16,479 --> 00:39:18,481
Huh? That's weird.

523
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,775
Did I not slide it down?

524
00:39:22,109 --> 00:39:23,319
I'm sure I did.

525
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,475
Yeah, Taeyong. Are you almost here?

526
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:55,601
Hurry upstairs then.

527
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,367
Lucky you,

528
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,994
Na Juhee.

529
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,541
That's a relief.

530
00:40:18,874 --> 00:40:21,710
So you got the statement
that Seo Juntae met my dad.

531
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:24,130
We need more concrete evidence.

532
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:27,466
This is the plate number of the car
Park Sanggu drove ten years ago.

533
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,428
According to him, Seo Juntae
went to meet President Na alone,

534
00:40:30,511 --> 00:40:31,846
but I can't believe him.

535
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,348
I'll look into it.

of checking cases from ten years ago?

538
00:40:42,648 --> 00:40:45,818
It's all thanks to Seungcheon.
I'm so grateful to him.

539
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,989
I see. Seungcheon.

540
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:55,619
Wait. Did I leave it like that?

541
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,497
What is it?

542
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:00,499
Nothing.

543
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,793
Hey, it's late. Go home now.

544
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,301
What are you doing?

545
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:11,677
I'll go over these with you.

546
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,888
This is my business too.

547
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:22,521
Do you have an extra laptop?

548
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,358
A laptop? Mm.

549
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,919
My old laptop should be
somewhere around here.

550
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:52,927
Let's try this one.

551
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:57,681
Whoa!

552
00:41:58,933 --> 00:41:59,850
Ta-da.

553
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,237
You still have what I got you.

554
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,615
Seungcheon gave it to me.

555
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,034
You never gave me a plushy.

556
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:20,246
Ah, I meant another girl.

557
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,082
Someone prettier than you. I got confused.

558
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:27,545
I guess the prince of Dosin
plays claw crane on a date too.

559
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,218
I found it.

560
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:36,387
Give it to me.

561
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,599
What was that?

562
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,396

00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,313

Seungcheon, just when
are you going to marry Juhee?

573
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:16,260
How much longer will you maintain
a lukewarm relationship

saying you're her friend and family?

What marriage? They're not even going out.

00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:30,524
If I were Juhee,
I'd never date a man like you.

579
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:34,361
I'd never date a man who doesn't have
a property deed in his name.

580
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,989
Never ever.

That may be the case for you,
you materialist.

585
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,958
-Look at you.
-Juhee is different.

586
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,878
She is not.
It's just that she doesn't show it.

587
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,297
She was from a rich family.
She has high standards.

588

Seungcheon, it's okay.

589
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:56,634
However the world turns out
or whatever people say,

590
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,802
it won't sway Juhee.

I brewed coffee, but he's asleep.

Go home and rest.

00:46:15,606 --> 00:46:16,648
How nice.

609
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:44,802
Mr. Jang.

610
00:46:46,762 --> 00:46:47,638
Yes, sir.

611
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,560
I didn't see Taeyong in the morning.
Is there something wrong?

612
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:55,938
He left early to go to work.

613
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,941
Left early? Or maybe
he didn't come home last night.

614
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,906
What has he been up to these days?

615
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:10,702
You'd better tell me everything.

616
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,727
It's so convenient.

617
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:50,742
Why is he here?

618
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:58,709
Taeyong.

619
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:03,672
Hwang Taeyong, what are you doing?

620
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,966
Hey, you're up.

621
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:09,011
Can't you see? I'm cooking.

622
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,392
I'm making spicy bulgogi.
Are you okay with it?

623
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,354
Did you make all these?

624
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:21,481
I'm good at everything, you see.

625
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,076
Mmm. It's good.

626
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,578
I'm almost done. Take a seat.

627
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,875
It must be the old lady from downstairs.
The water bill's due today.

628
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,752
Coming.

629
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,676
Juhee, my mom told me to give--

630
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:22,918
Mmm.

631
00:49:24,753 --> 00:49:25,963
You're pretty good at cooking.

632
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:29,216
But is it okay for a CEO
to be doing this here?

633
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,427
We're all trying to live.
A CEO should have breakfast too.

634
00:49:34,763 --> 00:49:35,889
I guess you're not squeamish.

635
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:39,101
You can sleep and eat at a place
like this. How unexpected of you.

636
00:49:41,728 --> 00:49:43,897
Right. Hwang Taeyong.

637
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,316
You had a golden spoon, didn't you?

638
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,404
I remember arguing with you over it.

639
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,323
Do you still have it?

640
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,994
A golden spoon?

641
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:03,542
Well, I'm not sure.

642
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,632
I forgot, I had an emergency meeting
this morning.

643
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:11,842
I need to go.

644
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,303
Bye, Juhee.

645
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,265
Taeyong.

646
00:50:24,312 --> 00:50:25,647
He's weird.

647
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:40,495
-Here.
-Thanks.

648
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:51,506
I get that he offered to help,
but you shouldn't have let him sleep here.

649
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:55,552
It's not that I let him sleep over.
It just happened.

650
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,765
I'll go over all these for you,

651
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,143
so tell him not to come again, okay?

652
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:04,561
Goodness.

653
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:16,656
This is my house.

654
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:19,618
Seungcheon, check this out.

655
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:26,875
Seo Juntae?

656
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:29,169
It's Seo Juntae, right?

657
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:48,313
How can I help you?

658
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:53,276
How do I request a re-investigation?

659
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:56,530
Juhee requested a re-investigation?

660
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,823
It will be rejected,

661
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,658
but it seems she's preparing a story

662
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:02,119
on UBS's sellout and President Na's death.

663
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:13,755
And stopping it

664
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,591
is your job, Attorney Go.

665
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:22,764
I'll do my best to stop it,

666
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,476
but in the worst case,
people may begin to talk about

667
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,229
Seo Juntae, CEO Hwang, and even you.

668
00:52:37,863 --> 00:52:38,947
Na Juhee,

669
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,493
that girl, ended up blowing this up.

670
00:52:44,411 --> 00:52:46,580
-Attorney Go.
-Yes, sir.

671
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:50,750
Taeyong isn't the one who did it.

672
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:53,712
Of course, sir.

673
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,135
But at least for the stock price,
I need to nip this in the bud.

674
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,431
Get ready for a business trip.

675
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,644
Sanggu, get Na Juhee, first.

676
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,771
Then Taeyong will show up.

677
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:14,900
What?

678
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,862
What do you mean, you can't do that?

679
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:27,162
Who is it?

680
00:53:32,959 --> 00:53:34,085
Long time no see, Juntae.

681
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,254
Hyeondo.

682
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,050
Are you alone?

683
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:53,313
Ah, I'm sending this material
to other broadcasters and journalists.

684
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,607
It's the first draft of the title.

685
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,484
THE SECRET BEHIND THE SALE OF UBS
PRESIDENT NA'S DEATH, REALLY ACCIDENTAL?

686
00:53:58,526 --> 00:54:00,070
DOCUMENTARY NOTE EPISODE 84 PROPOSAL

687
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,571
SECRETS ABOUT UBS PRESIDENT NA'S
SUDDEN DEATH 10 YEARS AGO

688
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,200
1. UBS TV AND NA SANGGUK'S HISTORY
2. NA'S DEATH AND UBS TV'S FALL

689
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,994
Thank you, Soomin.

690
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,664
Let's start working on it
as soon as the re-investigation happens.

691
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,625
But will you be okay?

692
00:54:13,708 --> 00:54:16,836
-What if you get in trouble because--
-Don't worry.

693
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,172
I'll be fired at worst.

694
00:54:20,298 --> 00:54:22,634
But will Hwang Taeyong be all right?

695
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:25,887
If this becomes an issue,
it'll be pretty bad for him.

696
00:54:26,972 --> 00:54:28,682
-Did you tell him?
-I should.

697
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,267
I'll tell him in person.

698
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,269
Gosh.

699
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,521
Are you looking down on me?

700
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,982
Do you know who I am?

701
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,025
I'm Geum Sukja.

702
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:43,780
I was once a district councilor
of Gangnam-gu.

703
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,701
Why aren't you giving me
a fried egg like everyone else?

704
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,996
I gave you one. I know you had it.

705
00:54:51,079 --> 00:54:52,872
No, you didn't.

706
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:56,918
Are you looking down on me
because I'm homeless or what?

707
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:00,839
Give me my money back.
My 100 won. Give it back to me!

708
00:55:01,339 --> 00:55:02,173
Here.

709
00:55:05,343 --> 00:55:07,304
-What do you think you're doing?
-What?

710
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:10,348
Wait! Goodness.

711
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:16,271
Excuse me!

712
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:20,859
Why is she following me?

713
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,405
Wait a second.

714
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:28,158
No, wait!

715
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:32,662
Just wait!

716
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:40,754
Wait! Just a second!

717
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:45,300
-Wait a second!
-What the…

718
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,010
Go away!

719
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:51,097
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

720
00:55:51,181 --> 00:55:53,224
Stop for just one second!

721
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,979
I just need a second!

722
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:38,103
A golden spoon?

723
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,398
Well, I'm not sure.

724
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:43,233
It was nothing serious.

725
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,945
Why was he so surprised?

726
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:48,238
Hey, Lee Seungcheon.

727
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:49,989
What's with the serious face?

728
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:54,452
He hasn't been able to get a job.
Of course, he's serious, you jobless bum.

729
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:58,081
So why did you have to quit working
at a nice company like Most Lab?

730
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,875
Goodness, you jobless bums.

731
00:57:01,376 --> 00:57:03,545
You talk too much for another jobless bum.

732
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,258
Seungcheon, why don't you
stream online instead?

733
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:11,845
Unlike someone we know,
you're handsome, good at French,

734
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,264
and right, good at playing the piano too.

735
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,808
Your channel will have a clear identity.

736
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:21,312
Forget it.

737
00:57:21,396 --> 00:57:23,106
I don't want to do anything.

738
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,482
-What?
-The piano?

739
00:57:25,316 --> 00:57:28,778
-Seungcheon could play the piano?
-Did you forget?

740
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:30,697
Remember Taeyong's birthday?

741
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:32,949
-I don't remember.
-He played that difficult piece…

742
00:57:34,909 --> 00:57:36,703
…like this and surprised everyone.

743
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,621
What was the title of it?

744
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,249
Polonaise by Chopin.

745
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,502
-Polonaise.
-"Polonaise."

746
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,505
CHOPIN: POLONAISE NO.6
IN A FLAT MAJOR OP. 53

747
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,886
-Is this it?
-Yes.

748
00:57:54,971 --> 00:57:57,765
Seungcheon, play this for me later
so I can use it as background music.

749
00:57:58,349 --> 00:58:00,477
Royalties are really expensive these days.

750
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,731
Just take everything that he has,
why don't you?

751
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:27,754
Play this for me later, okay?

752
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,676
It's strange the more I think about it.

753
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,018
When did you learn how to play the piano?

754
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:44,312
I'm not sure.
I don't remember taking lessons,

755
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:45,230
but I could just do it.

756
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:47,190
Taeyong, do you also have soup first
when you have a meal?

757
00:58:48,107 --> 00:58:49,400
Look how both picked out the chili.

758
00:58:49,484 --> 00:58:50,860
-What?
-He's just like dad.

759
00:58:50,944 --> 00:58:52,820
You're right.

760
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,198
Others might think Taeyong's my son, sir.

761
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:58,576
If you could trade your parents
for wealthy ones,

762
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:01,204
you would do that in a heartbeat.

763
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,751
Are you playing it already?

764
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,225
MY HOUSE

765
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,477
A 30,000-WON GOLDEN SPOON
THAT CAN MAKE YOU BECOME RICH

766
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,188
BECOME RICH AND PAY OFF
MY FAMILY'S DEBT!!!

767
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:28,481
MAY 2011, JUNE 2012
ANOTHER CHANCE, D-5

768
00:59:34,988 --> 00:59:37,156
"Swap your parents with your friend's."

769
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:38,992
No way.

770
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:41,828
Is this

771
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,039
real?

772
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,473
Lee Seungcheon?

773
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:03,600
Hwang Taeyong.

774
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,394
I'm here to check something with you.

775
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,539
Na Juhee? What are you doing here?

776
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:29,125
To say something to Taeyong.
Let's go inside.

777
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,087
You know the golden spoon granny,
don't you?

778
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:40,595
The golden spoon granny? Who's that?

779
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,222
Haven't you heard the story
about a golden spoon

780
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,266
that can swap your parents?

781
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:51,731
Say what I can understand.

782
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:58,029
When I was little,

783
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:01,366
I had the talent to differentiate
what was authentic from fake.

784
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,328
But as I grew up,
it eventually disappeared.

785
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:29,977
I'm so confused about

786
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,772
whether I'm really Lee Seungcheon.
I can't be sure.

787
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,443
I know this is ridiculous,

788
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,320
but things come together too well.

789
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,782
You had a golden spoon
when we were seniors in high school.

790
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:50,707
You're at it again.

791
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:54,168
All right, let's say that I had it.
So what?

792
01:01:54,252 --> 01:01:55,628
Be honest with me, Hwang Taeyong.

793
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:59,966
That golden spoon…

794
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,553
Did you buy it
from the golden spoon granny?

795
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:07,807
Tell me.

796
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,309
Are you really Hwang Taeyong?

797
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:19,694
If he isn't Hwang Taeyong,

798
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,989
are you trying to say that you are?

799
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:26,117
What an amusing story.

800
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,663
Taeyong, did you really have
that kind of magical golden spoon?

801
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:32,957
You had the golden spoon, Yeojin.

802
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:37,253
I saw it in your room
back when I visited your house.

803
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:40,798
-Mm. You remember, right?
-Well,

804
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:42,842
did she?

805
01:02:44,927 --> 01:02:48,222
Right. That's what I picked
at my first birthday party.

806
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:50,266
What's so strange
about me having a golden spoon?

807
01:02:50,850 --> 01:02:54,562
It wouldn't be strange
even if Taeyong had a diamond spoon.

808
01:02:55,146 --> 01:02:58,524
Seungcheon, were you
that jealous of Taeyong?

809
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,862
Even so, how could you claim
you were Hwang Taeyong?

810
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,364
You need to be treated
for being this delusional.

811
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,950
Oh Yeojin, watch what you say.

812
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,327
Aren't I right?

813
01:03:10,244 --> 01:03:12,413
Or do you think he's being rational?

814
01:03:13,498 --> 01:03:16,709
He's poor and jobless.

815
01:03:17,293 --> 01:03:18,336
His love seems hopeless.

816
01:03:18,836 --> 01:03:21,422
Seungcheon, I know your situation,
but this isn't right.

817
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:25,343
Should I connect you to a good hospital?

818
01:03:25,426 --> 01:03:27,929
Don't worry about the money.
I'll help you with it.

819
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,388
That's enough.

820
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:38,231
I'm sorry.
I must have lost my mind for a bit.

821
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,028
I'll be off.

822
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,616
Seungcheon! Seungcheon!

823
01:04:03,047 --> 01:04:04,674
Seungcheon! Seungcheon!

824
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,552
Seungcheon, let's talk for a bit.

825
01:04:10,721 --> 01:04:12,265
Juhee, I'm so sorry.

826
01:04:14,183 --> 01:04:16,686
But let's talk later.

827
01:04:27,071 --> 01:04:28,197
Seungcheon…

828
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:31,534
I didn't think
that notebook still existed.

829
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,287
It doesn't matter.

830
01:04:35,413 --> 01:04:37,164
No one's going to believe it.

831
01:04:38,165 --> 01:04:40,710
I shouldn't have left something like that.

832
01:04:41,502 --> 01:04:43,379
I'm such an idiot.

833
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:47,508
Don't worry.

834
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,136
No one can find out
that you are not Hwang Taeyong.

835
01:04:50,845 --> 01:04:53,556
I'm the only one
who knows you are Lee Seungcheon.

836
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,434
Just as how you are the only one who knows

837
01:04:58,060 --> 01:04:59,186
that I am Jeong Nara.

838
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,574
1 UNREAD MESSAGE
PARK JANGGUN

839
01:05:12,867 --> 01:05:14,243
Yeojin, check this out.

840
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,536
FORMER CEO OF DOSIN HIGHTECH
SEO JUNTAE, TURNS HIMSELF IN

841
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:19,040
What is it?

842
01:05:25,379 --> 01:05:28,257
What on earth is that golden spoon?

843
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,185
Yes, Soomin. How did it go?

844
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:42,188
A news report? What news report?

845
01:05:48,694 --> 01:05:51,155
The former CEO of Dosin
Hightech, Seo Juntae, turned himself in

846
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:54,450
for murdering President Na Sangguk
of UBS in 2012,

847
01:05:54,533 --> 01:05:57,203
sending shockwaves throughout the country.

848
01:05:57,286 --> 01:06:00,998
The weapon used for the murder

849
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:02,541
hasn't been revealed yet.

850
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:05,294
The police have mentioned
that they are planning

851
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:07,588
to investigate the details of the case

852
01:06:07,672 --> 01:06:09,715
and his motive for the murder.

853
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,648
I was just jealous of Taeyong.

854
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,693
I was so jealous

855
01:06:31,362 --> 01:06:33,197
that I must have lost my mind.

856
01:07:04,770 --> 01:07:07,815
Come and buy the golden spoon.

857
01:07:08,315 --> 01:07:10,609
The golden spoon that can make you rich!

858
01:07:18,492 --> 01:07:21,996
GOLDEN SPOON THAT MAKES YOU RICH
30,000 WON

859
01:07:54,361 --> 01:07:56,363
THE GOLDEN SPOON

860
01:07:56,447 --> 01:07:58,574
You are Lee Seungcheon.

861
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,533
And I'm Hwang Taeyong.

862
01:08:00,201 --> 01:08:01,577
How dare you steal my life?

863
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,913
Where did you get this suitcase?

864
01:08:03,996 --> 01:08:05,915
Don't serve any meals?

865
01:08:05,998 --> 01:08:07,917
A jerk who only cares about money.

866
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,502
That's Lee Seungcheon.

867
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:10,753
You're the one who abandoned your parents.

868
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:11,670
Lee Seungcheon!

869
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:13,589
I'm a piece of trash.

870
01:08:13,672 --> 01:08:16,300
You mean, a golden spoon
that can make you rich…

871
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:17,343
What's with you?

872
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:18,552
Father.

873
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:21,263
Could Taeyong be Seungcheon?
