1
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,947
THE GOLDEN SPOON

2
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,203
FINAL EPISODE

3
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,539
Every secret you shared with me.

4
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:41,458
I handed it all to the prosecution.

5
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,709
I see.

6
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:46,838
But did you think

7
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,343
I was clueless about it?

8
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:57,223
You alone will pay for all those sins,

9
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,684
including the murder of President Na.

10
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:00,977
You killed him.

11
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,395
No, you killed him.

12
00:01:02,979 --> 00:01:05,356
Taeyong's jacket with President Na's
bloodstain on it…

13
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,441
I mean, your jacket.

14
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:08,902
I handed it to the prosecution.

15
00:01:08,985 --> 00:01:10,236
Mr. Hwang Taeyong.

16
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:13,406
You're under arrest
for the murder of Na Sangguk.

17
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,825
You have the right to remain silent

18
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,993
and to consult an attorney.

19
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,871
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

20
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,207
You should pay the price for your sins.

21
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,960
I won't go easy on you
just because you're my son.

22
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:27,879
You can take him.

23
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,841
Damn it!

24
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,219
Get him!

25
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:42,894
Hurry up!

26
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:53,863
Sir.

27
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,533
-Hurry!
-Let's go.

28
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:58,701
-Get him!
-Stop right there!

29
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,871
Please be on the lookout
for license plate number 5618.

30
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:05,125
Can you believe it? Hwang Taeyong…

31
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,751
Hey, Juhee.

32
00:02:08,002 --> 00:02:10,797
Hwang Taeyong is wanted
for violating the Capital Markets Act

33
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,133
and the murder of Na Sangguk,

34
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,135
the former president of UBS TV.

35
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,096
What is this?

36
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,016
Why are you here instead of Seungcheon?

37
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:26,271
You haven't even used
your golden spoon three times yet.

38
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,397
I demand a refund.

39
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,065
I won't use this anymore,

40
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,484
so please give me back my 30,000 won.

41
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:34,779
What? A refund?

42
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,948
Goodness.

43
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,118
You're the first customer
to ever ask for a refund.

44
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,078
Think wisely.

45
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,164
Won't you regret it?

46
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:48,501
I won't.

47
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,463
Also, this is an evil hobby of yours.

48
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,923
Why do you sell such things?

49
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,383
What do you mean?

50
00:02:55,466 --> 00:03:00,138
It's because everyone complains
about how unfair this world is.

51
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,015
I ought to give them

52
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,018
an opportunity like this
so they wouldn't feel that way.

53
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:11,357
I don't need this opportunity,
so give me back my money.

54
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:13,568
Right now.

55
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:17,071
Fine. Hold on.

56
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,743
Ten, twenty… Here's thirty thousand won.

57
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,787
Why are they all crumpled up?

58
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,796
Right. Don't bother waiting
for Seungcheon.

59
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,964
He won't show up.

60
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:39,677
There are always people like him

61
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,014
who don't bother coming back
once they get what they want.

62
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,769
I had something important
to tell him for the last time.

63
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,522
Whatever. I guess he'll never find out.

64
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,732
I know what it is.

65
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,193
Whoever eats with his golden spoon

66
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:58,655
will gain all of his memory. Right?

67
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,740
How did you know that?

68
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:06,454
That girl, Yeojin,
must have told you. Right?

69
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:11,292
Look at that. Speak of the devil.

70
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:14,712
She's calling because she knows
that I was bad-mouthing her.

71
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:15,922
Jeez.

72
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,634
OH YEOJIN

73
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,056
Hello?

74
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,100
This is unexpected.

75
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,853
What?

76
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,654
-I just--
-You can't come in.

77
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,656
-I have something to tell him.
-You can't come in.

78
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,950
-I need to see President Hwang!
-You can't!

79
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,035
I have something to say to him!

80
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,298
Those are all your wrongdoings.

81
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,174
How could you blame it on Taeyong?

82
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,218
"Taeyong?"

83
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,971
I guess you're Lee Seungcheon to the bone.

84
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:09,475
Right. That must be why
you chose to live as him.

85
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,395
Idiot.

86
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:13,479
What was that?

87
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,649
Do you think you're all that, Gwon Yohan?

88
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,861
You just stole what was my father's!

89
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,661
That's a big misunderstanding.

90
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:33,374
Dosin could only come this far
thanks to me.

91
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,626
Your father would have made it go under.

92
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,337
And both of you

93
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,214
were just blessed with wealthy parents.
Aren't I right?

94
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,842
That's still not a valid reason
for stealing someone else's life.

95
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:46,929
Then is it fair to live a life of luxury
solely because of your parents?

96
00:05:47,555 --> 00:05:51,684
A world where your talent
and hard work pay off

97
00:05:51,768 --> 00:05:54,896
is what you call fair.

98
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:57,899
You're wrong. I beg to differ.

99
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,443
It's unfair for your parents' wealth
to define you,

100
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:03,738
but it's also wrong to think
that your talent is everything.

101
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,783
Whether or not you're
from a wealthy family or have talent,

102
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,660
everyone is the same.

103
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,954
Humans can't ever...

104
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,665
be the same.

105
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:18,419
Due to those morals of yours,

106
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:22,590
you will forever trap yourself in poverty.

107
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,053
I don't care because I will never be
a murderer like you.

108
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,270
Do you have proof?

109
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,650
Right. You may regain your memory
if you return to being Hwang Taeyong.

110
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:42,068
But what a shame.

111
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,278
It's already too late.

112
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,199
Lee Seungcheon will never visit
that golden spoon granny again.

113
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,159
Just like me.

114
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:08,177
"Lee Seungcheon will never visit
that golden spoon granny again."

115
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,471
"Just like me."

116
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:21,983
Hwang Hyeondo...

117
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,194
didn't meet the old woman again, then?

118
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,539
I found the suspect's vehicle.

119
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:38,708
License plate number 5618.

120
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:40,460
The suspect has fled.

121
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,881
What should we do now?

122
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:47,008
Let's split up.

123
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,843
Being with me will only put you in danger.

124
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,219
Cut that nonsense.

125
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:54,640
-Speaking of which…
-Yes, sir.

126
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,519
Either drop the honorifics
or keep them. You're confusing me.

127
00:07:58,603 --> 00:08:00,813
Are you seriously joking right now?

128
00:08:03,774 --> 00:08:06,068
Don't pick up.
They can trace you. Turn it off.

129
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:07,904
I need to take this.

130
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,156
Hey, it's me.

131
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:13,993
What do you mean?

132
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,287
Hwang Hyeondo never revisited
the old woman.

133
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,289
That means he doesn't know the last rule.

134
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:23,544
Find Hwang Hyeondo's golden spoon.

135
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,588
He could have kept it
somewhere close to him.

136
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,480
Why are we at the company
when we should be fleeing?

137
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,315
I need to find something in his office.

138
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:04,252
-Didn't you hear?
-No.

139
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,505
Hwang Hyeondo reported his son
so that he wouldn't have to

140
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,090
give over his company.

141
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,633
How terrifying.

142
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,928
I can't believe the murdering son
or his father who reported him.

143
00:09:14,011 --> 00:09:16,764
Tell me about it.
Working here gives me the chills.

144
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,848
Seriously.

145
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,102
What is your plan?

146
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:27,441
DOSIN TOWER
2F EXHIBIT HALL

147
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,112
Quite a lot of them
belong to my rich friends.

148
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:34,448
Things that are a hassle to keep
but a waste to throw out.

149
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,867
Some of them are from your father.

150
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:42,498
TAEYONG

151
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:46,335
The number you have dialed is…

152
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,632
-I need to go out for a bit.
-Sure.

153
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:55,803
Poor girl.

154
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,223
She tried so hard to seduce CEO Hwang.

155
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,183
She must be shocked.

156
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,102
Are you serious?

157
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:07,815
A third party like us
who don't know the full story

158
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:11,360
should do nothing
but just remain tight-lipped.

159
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:14,947
You're right. I shouldn't say anything.

160
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,199
Right, speaking of which,

161
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,368
Ms. Na asked me to transfer something.

162
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,335
A CONVERSATION WITH A CELEBRITY
PRESIDENT NA SANGGUK

163
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:34,342
Juhee, did you get in touch
with Seungcheon? Where is he?

164
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,969
I don't know. His phone is off.

165
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:41,349
Taeyong told me that Hwang Hyeondo
also has a golden spoon.

166
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,225
We must find Seungcheon right now.

167
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,102
He might get killed
even before getting caught.

168
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:49,315
That should never happen.
We must find a way.

169
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,650
There's no way.

170
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:55,488
No one in this country
can beat Hwang Hyeondo.

171
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,535
Nevertheless,

172
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:06,332
there's one way to save Seungcheon.

173
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,583
I know.

174
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,003
He should return to his old self.

175
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,296
Yeojin.

176
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,465
Today's the day he can meet
with the old woman.

177
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,051
He can save himself
by returning to his old self.

178
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,096
Juhee, please persuade him.

179
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,722
This is his way out.

180
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,895
Then what about Taeyong?
What'll happen to him?

181
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,776
That's none of my concern.

182
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,403
I just need to save Seungcheon.

183
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,532
Even if it means others will get hurt.

184
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:44,203
Yeojin, I want to save him
as much as you do. But this isn't right.

185
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:47,164
And the Seungcheon I know

186
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,250
would never do that.

187
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,963
So you don't want to persuade him?

188
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,258
Fine. Keep acting holier-than-thou
until the end.

189
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,269
There must be a way.

190
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:14,650
Hello?

191
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:16,777
Who is this?

192
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,362
Juhee, it's me.

193
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,618
Seungcheon.

194
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,704
Gosh.

195
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,166
They say you never know
someone's true face,

196
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,417
but this is just unbelievable.

197
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,712
-I can't believe it either.
-Exactly.

198
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:39,049
CEO Hwang isn't the type to commit murder.

199
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:43,220
He may be annoying at times,
but he's considerate and kind.

200
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,221
Wait.

201
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,184
You seem to know him pretty well.

202
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:51,020
Of course I do.

203
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,188
He…

204
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:59,069
He told me never to tell you this.

205
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,657
I didn't charge you less rent
for your house and this store

206
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:05,868
out of the goodness of my heart.

207
00:13:07,077 --> 00:13:08,788
He paid the difference.

208
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:12,124
What?

209
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:35,457
-Freeze, Hwang Taeyong!
-Freeze!

210
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,711
-What?
-What are you doing?

211
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,212
-He's not here.
-What's going on?

212
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,547
Damn it.

213
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,312
No one's outside.

214
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,149
Have you eaten, Taeyong?

215
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,819
No, right? Let me prepare some food.

216
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:10,868
Why aren't you asking me anything?

217
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:18,459
I trust you.

218
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,589
With regard to everything.

219
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:26,342
I do.

220
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:36,977
Hey, son. When did you come home?

221
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:38,896
That smells delicious.

222
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,356
Hey.

223
00:15:41,148 --> 00:15:42,483
After dinner,

224
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,235
should we play basketball together?

225
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,406
Are you down?

226
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,908
Honey, the soup is spilling over.

227
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,117
Ah.

228
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,704
Gosh, that's hot.

229
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:19,895
How could you follow me into the church?

230
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:24,191
I'm sorry. We thought you were meeting
with Hwang Taeyong. I'm sorry.

231
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,403
Follow me one more time,

232
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,071
and I won't sit still.

233
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,739
-Okay?
-I'm sorry.

234
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:35,077
-I'm sorry.
-I'm sorry.

235
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:37,162
Let's go.

236
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:39,957
I'm sorry.

237
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:44,628
-Darn it.
-Juhee, be patient.

238
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,172
I'll come to you.

239
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,217
I hope he's safe.

240
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,511
Eat up, Taeyong.

241
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,430
It looks tasty.

242
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:01,603
I was sad
that I couldn't have some last time.

243
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,273
Thank you.

244
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:08,736
I'm glad I had
some leftover frozen dumplings.

245
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,446
I know you like dumpling soup.

246
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,785
Mother.

247
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,122
What is your favorite dish?

248
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,124
What?

249
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:25,961
Come to think of it,

250
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,173
I don't know much about my parents.

251
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,470
What they like or dislike.

252
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,931
What they were like when they were young.

253
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,643
How they met…

254
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,190
and fell in love.

255
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,485
I don't know anything.

256
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:52,738
I was never curious.

257
00:17:56,158 --> 00:18:00,871
We're not curious
about things that we're used to.

258
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,252
You only know how precious they were...

259
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,089
once they're gone.

260
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,429
The soup's getting cold. Eat up.

261
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,422
If this can clear your name,

262
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:56,093
then it's all yours.

263
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,763
Thank you for trusting me.

264
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,100
You know I always hold a long position
when it comes to you.

265
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:05,853
I wonder why you and your father
are fussing over this spoon.

266
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,313
It really doesn't look that special to me.

267
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,692
You're right. It's all useless.

268
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,653
There must be a story behind it.

269
00:19:14,736 --> 00:19:18,323
But don't tell me.
I don't want to meddle in your affairs.

270
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:23,453
Maybe it was because I wasn't born
with a golden spoon in my mouth,

271
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,414
but I never liked this spoon,
to begin with.

272
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:26,957
Take it.

273
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,584
Do remember my name
since we'll become best friends.

274
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,922
I will buy this golden spoon.

275
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,299
All right.

276
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,884
Hey, Hwang Hyeondo!

277
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,393
Could I have a meal?

278
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,647
Thank you so much.

279
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,902
You have lost to this money.

280
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,570
Although you might hate to admit it.

281
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:41,865
TURN YOURSELF IN

282
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,868
The one who ruined your life wasn't me,

283
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,745
but your mom.

284
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:51,667
Here. This is all I have.
This is the original.

285
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,170
Why did you kill Gwon Yohan?

286
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,028
Taeyong.

287
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:24,116
Taeyong, do you have anywhere to go?

288
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,827
Of course. Don't worry about me.

289
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,204
How could I not?

290
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,459
Mother.

291
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:39,715
May I…

292
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:48,140
hug you just once?

293
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:07,909
Mom.

294
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:12,706
Please stay healthy.

295
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,262
Taeyong.

296
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,687
Taeyong.

297
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:18,438
A CCTV camera recorded
Gwon Yohan murdering Hwang Hyeondo.

298
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,565
The original file
could still be somewhere.

299
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,275
Could it still be around?

300
00:23:22,943 --> 00:23:24,319
It could have been discarded.

301
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:27,239
Let's do everything we can.
We can't just sit still.

302
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:28,990
Okay.

303
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:33,578
MS. WANG SOOMIN

304
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:34,996
-Juhee.
-Yes?

305
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,499
Ah.

306
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,379
Hi, Soomin. I'm not coming in today.

307
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,880
I know.

308
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:48,135
But there's something you need to see.

309
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,919
-Why are you here?
-To see my father.

310
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,088
Pretend you didn't see me.

311
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:29,509
Do you think I'd do that?

312
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:30,927
Yes.

313
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:38,894
Your cocky attitude
always rubbed me the wrong way.

314
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,024
But I despise your father even more.

315
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,152
So I'll help you.

316
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,280
What can I do?

317
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,618
Hello, Father.

318
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:39,955
The coffee smells nice.

319
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,749
Have you decided to turn yourself in?

320
00:25:43,792 --> 00:25:44,793
Of course not.

321
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,921
I just came by to tell you
that I donated the money

322
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,758
you had stashed away
in your Swiss account.

323
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:55,971
You couldn't possibly have done that.

324
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,020
What is it?

325
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:07,899
I donated 2.5 trillion won to an NGO?

326
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,860
What are you talking about?

327
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,739
See?

328
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,741
I told you.

329
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,416
You?

330
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,043
How?

331
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,837
How did you know about it?

332
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,263
It was thanks to your golden spoon.

333
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,602
You should have visited the old woman
one last time to at least say thank you.

334
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,521
Then you would have learned the last rule.

335
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,107
The last rule?

336
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,777
I could see everything
after eating with this.

337
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:54,529
All your money.

338
00:26:55,488 --> 00:26:56,656
Your past.

339
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:00,994
The sins you've committed.

340
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,623
You looked down on my dad...

341
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,460
and provoked Seo Juntae to kill himself.

342
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:12,130
You also brutally murdered
Gwon Yohan and President Na.

343
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,050
I witnessed…

344
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:18,178
everything.

345
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,564
I came across this footage

346
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,191
in President Na's interview tape.

347
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:33,443
That's President Hwang Hyeondo.

348
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,196
This must be the original file
that my dad had.

349
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,699
I'll report this to the police
and try to reach out to Taeyong.

350
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:45,246
Will reporting this even do anything?

351
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,665
We're talking about Hwang Hyeondo.

352
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:50,460
Hey! You'd better not think
about airing this.

353
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:51,920
Jeez, you're such a scaredy-cat.

354
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:53,421
Yes, I am.

355
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,924
You can air this somewhere
that isn't sponsored by Dosin.

356
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,050
Do that.

357
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:58,843
-Darn you!
-Jeez.

358
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,931
-Going live in five minutes. Hurry up.
-Okay.

359
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,641
Are you ready, ma'am?

360
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:09,187
Gosh, that really helps
your skin become more elastic.

361
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,315
By the way, I haven't seen
Mr. Park Janggun in a while.

362
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,402
He said he'd treat us to a hotel buffet
if our social media and online accounts

363
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,737
reached ten million
and five million followers.

364
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,784
I'll treat you guys instead,
so don't mention him.

365
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,120
We don't work together anymore.

366
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,037
I see…

367
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,040
The live broadcast will begin
at 8 o'clock.

368
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,171
NA JUHEE

369
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,298
Na Juhee?

370
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,300
So?

371
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:42,595
Are you here

372
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,932
to punish me
with that lousy golden spoon as proof?

373
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,393
No.

374
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,229
I'm here to give you a chance...

375
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,692
to confess to your crimes
and turn yourself in.

376
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,779
After witnessing all your evil deeds,

377
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:03,491
I wanted nothing more than to kill you.

378
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:06,035
But I also saw moments

379
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,246
when you were proud of me.

380
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:13,418
I hope you like it, Father.

381
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,295
Thank you, Taeyong.

382
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:20,008
Do I not have to prove myself
to you anymore, then?

383
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,349
Yes, you're right.

384
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,769
I was proud of you.

385
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:34,731
Would this be how I feel…

386
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,568
if I had a real son?

387
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,448
You know what?

388
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,536
I never wanted a child.

389
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,956
Just like you and me,

390
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,627
I didn't need a child who'd betray me.

391
00:29:55,794 --> 00:29:58,505
Money. That was all I needed

392
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,382
because money never betrays you.

393
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:05,470
However, watching you...

394
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,473
gave me joy

395
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:09,974
and happiness.

396
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,393
I was proud.

397
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,438
So I thought to myself from time to time.

398
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:18,942
"How would it have been if he had been

399
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:21,653
my real son?"

400
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,284
You still have a chance.

401
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,161
I'm not sure.

402
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,287
All these years,

403
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:34,958
my hands

404
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,795
have shed a lot of blood.

405
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,465
Turn myself in and repent for my sins?

406
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:45,927
Would that even be possible?

407
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:48,388
I'd rather...

408
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:53,017
choose to live
the way I have lived so far.

409
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:08,283
Instead of talking about fashion,

410
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,579
I'd like to tell you
an uncomfortable piece of truth today.

411
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:16,541
The victim in the footage has passed away.

412
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:19,586
Find out who the killer is for yourselves.

413
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:23,006
LIVE - REVEALING THE TRUTH

414
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:26,301
Dongkyung.

415
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,054
-Mom, look!
-What?

416
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,390
-Look at this.
-You startled me. What is it?

417
00:31:33,391 --> 00:31:34,225
It's Hwang Hyeondo.

418
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,477
What is that?

419
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,898
-What is this?
-Is this real?

420
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,068
Isn't this President Hwang?

421
00:32:01,836 --> 00:32:02,837
Lee Seungcheon.

422
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,757
This is why you'll never win.

423
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:08,509
You should have just killed me.

424
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,763
Do you still not know me
after all of this?

425
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:32,325
Fine. I'll kill you like you told me to.

426
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,619
-I'll kill you!
-No!

427
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:38,331
Seungcheon, don't do this.
You'll end up just like him!

428
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:39,374
I don't care.

429
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,000
Lee Seungcheon!

430
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:44,003
Let me go!

431
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,048
Think of Dad!

432
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,968
Do you think

433
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:52,845
he'd be happy
to see you acting this way? Do you?

434
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,913
It's all over now. It's okay.

435
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:20,623
It's okay.

436
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,086
Hwang Hyeondo.

437
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,173
Taeyong. Taeyong.

438
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:31,426
Taeyong, are you okay?

439
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,988
I'm sorry. I'll untie you now.

440
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,591
Where do you think you're going?

441
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,886
I have no time to bicker with you too.

442
00:34:18,765 --> 00:34:19,640
It's Attorney Go.

443
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:24,687
He's with me right now.

444
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,731
Tell him to park near the back gate.

445
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:29,192
We're in the back garden.
Park near the back door.

446
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:31,069
Okay. Right now.

447
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,154
Deal with the matters here.

448
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:35,239
We'll talk more later.

449
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:39,660
Honey.

450
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:44,290
I can't let you go like this.

451
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,549
Shouldn't you...

452
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,302
pay for your sins?

453
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:58,346
There he is!

454
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:04,227
Youngshin.

455
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,105
I found out that you killed Yohan too.
You're incredible.

456
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,524
I don't think
this is enough of a punishment.

457
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,236
Take him away.

458
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:15,279
Mr. Hwang Hyeondo, you're under arrest.

459
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,989
You have the right to remain silent.

460
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:19,992
Anything you say may be used
against you in a court of law.

461
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,620
You have the right to consult an attorney.
Understood?

462
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,706
Come with us.

463
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,114
Are you okay?

464
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,911
Hey, look at this. Do I look okay?

465
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:10,251
Thanks. And…

466
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:14,797
I'm sorry,

467
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,841
Taeyong.

468
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,510
This will be the last time

469
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,888
I call you that.

470
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,393
Then let me say this too.

471
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:29,604
Thanks,

472
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,063
Lee Seungcheon.

473
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:35,568
Thanks to you, I became my parents' son.

474
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,455
Hey, Mom.

475
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,625
Yes. I'm going home now.

476
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,961
I'm an adult. Don't worry about me.

477
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,713
Okay. I'll be there.

478
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,302
She must be worried. You should go.

479
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,888
-What about you?
-I--

480
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,097
Let's go.

481
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,435
I should pay for the life
I've led as Hwang Taeyong.

482
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:36,087
Thanks, Yeojin. It's all thanks to you.

483
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,966
Don't thank me. I was just helping
my pitiful ex-boyfriend.

484
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:45,429
Yeojin, do you think
you could be my friend

485
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,057
just like Jeong Nara was?

486
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,726
It's not impossible,

487
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,771
but I don't think
we can talk for long right now.

488
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,191
First floor.

489
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,902
There she is.

490
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,028
Ms. Oh.

491
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,616
Ma'am, how did you get a hold
of Hwang Hyeondo's murder footage?

492
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,744
Did you call off your engagement
because of that footage?

493
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,663
-Excuse me!
-You're an influential--

494
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,081
-Jeez.
-What the…

495
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,209
Come on. You shouldn't do this.

496
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,585
Park Janggun.

497
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:21,007
Is no one here to help you? Look at you.

498
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,425
You only act all tough.

499
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,263
I'm Park Janggun of General Entertainment.

500
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,557
You can call my agency tomorrow
for any questions.

501
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,100
Please let us pass.

502
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,648
Goodness!

503
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:39,775
Let's go.

504
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,405
-Ms. Oh, can you just answer one thing?
-Ma'am.

505
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,657
-Can you tell us how you got the footage?
-Ms. Oh!

506
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,873
The prosecution has launched
a security investigation

507
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:59,295
to indict Dosin's President Hwang Hyeondo
and Dosin Hightech's CEO Hwang Taeyong

508
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:03,591
for violating the Capital Markets Act
and of killing UBS TV's President Na.

509
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,843
The prosecution is currently…

510
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:17,271
I found it!

511
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,497
Thanks, Munki.

512
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,415
I'm sorry you had to be interrogated.

513
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:40,252
I'll see you at home later.

514
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:51,764
Seungcheon.

515
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,982
Well done, Seungcheon.

516
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,443
It's all over now.

517
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,264
It's not over yet.

518
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,724
I just got out of the murder charge.

519
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:39,186
Stock manipulation
and creating paper companies.

520
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:41,814
I've yet to be punished for those.

521
00:40:42,398 --> 00:40:44,024
But why are we here?

522
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:07,465
I think it was around here.

523
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,718
Jinseok's house.

524
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,363
I wonder what happened to those

525
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,575
who lived in semi-basement houses here.

526
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:39,205
How many of them...

527
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:43,125
are still living here?

528
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,924
I was so afraid of being poor.

529
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:55,721
If I couldn't climb up high
like those apartments,

530
00:41:57,056 --> 00:41:59,975
I was afraid I'd be buried underneath.

531
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:04,813
And that fear consumed me.

532
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,985
Being up high
doesn't make you less afraid.

533
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:13,489
You're right.

534
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:16,492
But I didn't know that back then.

535
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,289
I'm speaking from experience.

536
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,793
Do you know what the best solution
for being scared is?

537
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,049
Holding hands.

538
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:36,095
The moment you have someone
who can hold your hand,

539
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:37,638
the fear vanishes.

540
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,598
Just keep holding on.

541
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:02,329
They found the paperweight
underneath a tree,

542
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,623
but the prosecutor
will be switched to one of ours.

543
00:43:04,707 --> 00:43:08,043
The best thing to do right now
is to remain silent and buy some time.

544
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:09,211
I got that.

545
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:14,383
Just take care of what I told you to do.

546
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:15,926
Yes, sir.

547
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:48,083
Go in. I'll wait out here.

548
00:43:49,209 --> 00:43:51,086
Yeah? Then I'll just go and pack my stuff.

549
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,380
Sir.

550
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,761
A few days ago, President Hwang ordered me

551
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,180
to cut down a tree
near the lake in the back garden.

552
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,390
But it was such a waste to cut it down.

553
00:44:07,978 --> 00:44:08,812
Then let it be.

554
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:13,817
Thank you. Thank you.

555
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:18,614
Wait here. I won't be long.

556
00:44:37,007 --> 00:44:38,425
I'll be quick.

557
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:54,983
I didn't even get
to revisit the old woman.

558
00:45:08,664 --> 00:45:09,873
Come in.

559
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,715
Young master, it's time for your meal.

560
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,469
That's okay.
I'll just drink that and leave.

561
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:42,656
He's going to stay at a hotel
for the time being.

562
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:43,574
I understand.

563
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,660
He wouldn't want to stay here.

564
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,331
I'm still his mother.

565
00:45:52,499 --> 00:45:54,042
I should go and say goodbye.

566
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:10,851
Taeyong?

567
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,814
Taeyong…

568
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:39,296
What's taking him so long?

569
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:13,789
Go over there.

570
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:21,505
-No, ma'am.
-Let me in.

571
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,006
Please let me in.

572
00:47:24,716 --> 00:47:27,010
Just let me in, please.

573
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:39,231
My poor young master!

574
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,818
What do you mean?

575
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,364
Young master!

576
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,582
No, Seungcheon.

577
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,959
Seungcheon.

578
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,255
No.

579
00:48:36,538 --> 00:48:38,332
Seungcheon, you should pray too.

580
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:39,917
I already did.

581
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,591
I prayed that
you'd still recognize and like me

582
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,509
even if I appeared in front of you…

583
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,264
as a completely different person.

584
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,162
WITH MR. LEE SEUNGCHEON!
THE GOLDEN SPOON

585
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,915
3 YEARS LATER

586
00:49:20,540 --> 00:49:22,751
Thank you for coming.

587
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:24,711
Please put a microphone on him.

588
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:27,297
Seeing so many readers here with us today

589
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,133
makes me realize
how popular you are once again.

590
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,344
-Please sit down.
-Okay.

591
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:33,804
EXPLORE LIFE, DREAM
THE GOLDEN SPOON

592
00:49:33,887 --> 00:49:35,639
We're ready.

593
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:36,890
Cue.

594
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:40,352
His webtoon is the talk of the town.

595
00:49:40,602 --> 00:49:44,022
I'm here with Mr. Lee Seungcheon
who drew The Golden Spoon.

596
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,399
Hello.

597
00:49:51,947 --> 00:49:55,283
Mr. Lee, what was so interesting
about your webtoon was that

598
00:49:55,367 --> 00:49:57,577
they could switch parents
with their golden spoon.

599
00:49:57,661 --> 00:49:59,871
That was very unique.

600
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,457
How did you get that idea?

601
00:50:02,541 --> 00:50:04,042
When I was little,

602
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,795
our family had a golden spoon.

603
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:10,632
I wanted to sell it
and get my mom a gold ring.

604
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:13,343
However, I couldn't find…

605
00:50:13,427 --> 00:50:14,594
Soomin.

606
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:16,638
You shouldn't have come here
when you're pregnant.

607
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,182
I wanted to keep tabs on my rival show.

608
00:50:20,267 --> 00:50:23,020
Gosh, Seungcheon is so good
at being interviewed.

609
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,313
Honey, I hope our Jackpot

610
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:28,692
will become successful just like him.

611
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:31,570
Jeez. Why do you keep calling
our baby that? I don't like it.

612
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:34,197
I just want our baby to hit the jackpot.

613
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,866
It really works.

614
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:39,995
What does the golden spoon mean to you?

615
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:41,204
This is also from my past.

616
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:42,748
When I was young,

617
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,876
I got into an accident
and lost some of my memory.

618
00:50:45,959 --> 00:50:48,545
But I do have one vivid memory.

619
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:51,757
Eating my mom's kimchi stew.

620
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:57,554
It was so delicious that I kept eating it.

621
00:50:58,346 --> 00:50:59,598
I was truly happy.

622
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,101
I'm sure everyone here
can empathize with you.

623
00:51:03,185 --> 00:51:06,146
Our mom's kimchi stew is the best.

624
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,231
My family was very poor,

625
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,692
but I received a lot from my parents.

626
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,279
Uh, although he never achieved his dream,

627
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:16,531
my dad drew relentlessly.

628
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,116
I have his passion.

629
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:22,621
My mom woke up every day at 4 a.m.
and got ready to open the store.

630
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:24,790
I have her diligence.

631
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,252
I was able to do this thanks to them.

632
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:32,839
You asked me
what the golden spoon meant to me.

633
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:36,468
I'm...

634
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,262
the golden spoon.

635
00:51:42,849 --> 00:51:44,059
I'm...

636
00:51:44,643 --> 00:51:45,811
the golden spoon.

637
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:47,687
Mom.

638
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,648
It all worked out well.

639
00:51:52,984 --> 00:51:55,779
-Are you crying?
-No, I'm not.

640
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,865
Honey, come here. Seungcheon is on TV.

641
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,951
Okay. Mother, please have some coffee.

642
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,120
You didn't need to get one for me.

643
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,454
Of course I should.

644
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:06,706
-Mr. Lee, is there anything…
-Thanks.

645
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,083
-…you'd like…
-Honey.

646
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:11,044
-…to tell your readers?
-Mmm.

647
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,003
Let me.

648
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:16,007
Golden spoons and dirt spoons
definitely exist in this society.

649
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:19,761
However, I hope you will all
consider yourselves golden spoons.

650
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,140
Trust and love yourselves.

651
00:52:24,349 --> 00:52:25,809
If not,

652
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:28,520
-you will always desire something more…
-Mom.

653
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:30,438
-What's with you?
-It's true!

654
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:32,858
…and forget who you truly are.

655
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,403
Since you're here,

656
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:39,197
I got you one extra fried egg each.

657
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,700
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

658
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:44,703
Another freebie. We were sponsored.

659
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:52,002
By the way, this handsome man
looks familiar.

660
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:54,713
-Your boyfriend?
-He's just a friend.

661
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:56,882
My childhood friend.

662
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,967
How's it like working here?

663
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:01,761
"As the former district councilor
of Gangnam, Geum Sukja,

664
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,805
do you think this place suits me?"

665
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:07,225
I'd like to say that,
but I'm grateful nonetheless.

666
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,856
I'm Kim Jinsook, the team manager
of the homeless shelter.

667
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,816
I'll give you one

668
00:53:15,317 --> 00:53:16,693
since you're handsome.

669
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:19,362
-Try to be creative with the food.
-Okay.

670
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:23,241
Is she the one about
the golden spoon from before--

671
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,995
If she finds out that you were the writer,

672
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:29,039
she'd have a fit and demand royalties.

673
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,000
She was upset and said the webtoon
was based on her story.

674
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:35,629
Um…

675
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,509
It's tastier like this.

676
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:49,893
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

677
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:51,728
-It's good.
-Right?

678
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:52,812
Yes, it's tasty.

679
00:53:52,896 --> 00:53:56,149
Right. Did you hear?

680
00:53:56,650 --> 00:53:58,526
Hwang Hyeondo is getting released.

681
00:53:59,861 --> 00:54:01,780
Yes, I heard yesterday.

682
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:07,953
A stay of execution of sentence
when he even poisoned his own son?

683
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:12,249
Can you be let off the hook for murder
as long as you have money?

684
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,877
If I ever meet
the golden spoon granny again,

685
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,045
I want to confront her.

686
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,505
Seungcheon lost his dad.

687
00:54:20,006 --> 00:54:23,510
He was willing to pay
for everything that he did.

688
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:27,305
So did he have to die like that?

689
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,766
Look at Hwang Hyeondo and Oh Yeojin.

690
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:31,893
They didn't pay for anything.

691
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:35,814
They will one day.

692
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:41,695
Or perhaps, they're already paying for it.

693
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:55,125
Yeojin, today is a busy day
with one photo shoot and two interviews.

694
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:59,087
Park Janggun, I told you
I'm not a celebrity.

695
00:54:59,170 --> 00:55:00,922
I need time to focus on my business.

696
00:55:01,006 --> 00:55:02,465
Exactly.

697
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,427
-Janggun.
-Yes, Father?

698
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,637
Yeojin has a weak body.

699
00:55:07,721 --> 00:55:10,181
It's nice to make money,
but don't overwork her.

700
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,850
Yes, Father.

701
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:16,146
Hey, those are all my princess' diapers.

702
00:55:16,229 --> 00:55:17,522
Put them in the storage room.

703
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:18,773
Yes, sir.

704
00:55:21,693 --> 00:55:25,822
Look at you. You're growing so much.

705
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:27,324
Hi, there.

706
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,617
You're so blessed, Oh Yeojin.

707
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:32,162
What?

708
00:55:32,662 --> 00:55:34,414
Nothing.

709
00:55:34,497 --> 00:55:35,915
I'll get going then.

710
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:37,417
Don't forget to take her out.

711
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,877
Don't worry about it.

712
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:40,545
-Bye.
-Bye.

713
00:55:40,628 --> 00:55:41,671
We'll get going then.

714
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:43,381
-Drive carefully.
-Yes, sir.

715
00:55:45,342 --> 00:55:46,509
Bye, Yeojin.

716
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,096
Who is it?

717
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,016
Hey, when will you pay me back?
Call me this instant!

718
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:55,810
Are you seriously not picking up?
Pay me back!

719
00:55:55,894 --> 00:55:58,063
-Give me 200 million won by this week.
-Gosh, my back.

720
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:59,773
-Or you're dead.
-I can't rest properly

721
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:01,399
because my Yeojin is so scary.

722
00:56:01,483 --> 00:56:05,779
Little princess, should we take a walk
around the neighborhood?

723
00:56:07,447 --> 00:56:09,532
-Sir.
-What?

724
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:10,658
Let me do it.

725
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,744
-Really?
-Yes.

726
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,746
I'll put her in her stroller
and take a walk.

727
00:56:14,829 --> 00:56:16,498
You can rest at home.

728
00:56:17,082 --> 00:56:18,917
-Will you really do that for me?
-Sure.

729
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,086
-One minute.
-Goodness.

730
00:56:21,169 --> 00:56:23,505
Go to him.

731
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,006
You're so pretty.

732
00:56:25,090 --> 00:56:26,132
Jeez.

733
00:56:26,216 --> 00:56:28,134
Gosh, I should take a nap.

734
00:56:28,635 --> 00:56:30,220
Okay. Sleep well.

735
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:54,411
Yes, it's me.

736
00:56:54,994 --> 00:56:57,747
I think I can get you the money.
Give me three days.

737
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:05,213
Hey, I hope you won't resent me.

738
00:57:05,922 --> 00:57:07,215
Darn it.

739
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:20,854
There he comes.

740
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,616
The prosecution has accepted
the application for suspension

741
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:36,161
of execution of the sentence of
Dosin's President Hwang Hyeondo.

742
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,705
From 8 a.m. today, the prosecution
held a deliberation committee

743
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:42,459
involving outside members,
including legal and medical personnel,

744
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:45,587
and decided to suspend Hwang's sentence.

745
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,381
As for his violation
of the Capital Markets Act…

746
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,592
Everyone is equal.

747
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:54,471
However, this world is unfair.

748
00:57:55,972 --> 00:57:59,017
Sir. Excuse me.

749
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,728
But you can't use the company card

750
00:58:02,937 --> 00:58:03,938
to drink, sir.

751
00:58:04,022 --> 00:58:06,232
What did you say? Hey.

752
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,443
What do you know?

753
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,613
How much money will make us happy?

754
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:13,198
I have some big news, Piggies.

755
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,618
My best friend, Seungcheon, drew
The Golden Spoon in this very room.

756
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,871
And now, I live here!

757
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:24,501
I'm going to hit the jackpot like he did
and turn my life around!

758
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:28,129
Janggun, thanks for the money.

759
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,964
Let's be rich!

760
00:58:30,048 --> 00:58:32,467
A hundred million?
One billion? Ten billion?

761
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:38,056
Let's watch the movie next time.

762
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,516
Can't we just watch it today?

763
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,767
Do you want to?

764
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,185
-Here's your change.
-Thank you.

765
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:43,937
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

766
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:47,482
Would you like some pocket money?

767
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:48,608
Ta-da!

768
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:50,360
Thank you.

769
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:54,280
There are those
who are content with even 10,000 won

770
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:57,867
while there are others
who can never be satisfied

771
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,661
no matter how much they have.

772
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,416
Honey, it's time for your medication.

773
00:59:51,462 --> 00:59:52,964
What a potent medication.

774
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:58,678
It even turned
a vicious person like you into a baby.

775
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,601
I heard you poisoned Taeyong with it.

776
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,487
But don't you worry.

777
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:21,618
I won't kill you...

778
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:25,246
until the business succession is complete.

779
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,586
Don't be too upset.

780
01:00:32,128 --> 01:00:35,923
This is the price you pay
for killing Yohan and Juntae.

781
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:50,188
But did you really not know

782
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:52,649
that Juntae was Yohan's son?

783
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:05,286
I'm sure you knew.

784
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,706
That's why I can't forgive you even more.

785
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:24,764
Pay for your sins.

786
01:01:47,495 --> 01:01:50,707
There's a gardener who earned
seven billion won amongst the bloggers.

787
01:01:51,207 --> 01:01:53,751
-A gardener?
-Yes. But weirdly he teaches

788
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:56,087
kids who got out of the orphanages
about stock investments.

789
01:01:56,170 --> 01:01:57,630
Isn't this worth investigating?

790
01:01:58,131 --> 01:02:00,591
But apparently,
he never takes on interviews.

791
01:02:00,675 --> 01:02:03,511
-So he's totally shrouded.
-Soomin, I'll take that.

792
01:02:03,803 --> 01:02:06,764
So what's his name?

793
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:16,023
Excuse me. Mr. Han Seonghun?

794
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:18,818
Mr. Han?

795
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,405
Who?

796
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:23,948
Uh…

797
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:26,951
I'm here to see Mr. Han Seonghun.

798
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,578
Ah, Seonghun?

799
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,747
He went to the beach
to get some fresh air.

800
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,374
You should call him on his phone.

801
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:27,261
Jeez, he told me to come here,
but where is he?

802
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:32,099
THE GOLDEN SPOON

803
01:03:40,441 --> 01:03:42,026
THE GOLDEN SPOON

804
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:47,240
OR WILL YOU RETURN
TO YOUR ORIGINAL PARENTS?

805
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:50,409
That's mine.

806
01:03:50,952 --> 01:03:53,371
I'm sorry. I was just…

807
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,972
Are you Ms. Na Juhee?

808
01:04:13,349 --> 01:04:14,934
Mr. Han Seonghun?

809
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:18,187
Yes. That's me.

810
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,021
Oh.

811
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:17,431
Taeyong…

812
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,108
Goodness!

813
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:32,571
This way!

814
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:38,911
I'm sorry.

815
01:06:40,121 --> 01:06:41,205
That way.

816
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:16,532
I'm hungry.

817
01:07:19,827 --> 01:07:22,663
Did you finish the entire book?

818
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,748
Yes.

819
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:27,585
But the more I read it,
the sadder I became.

820
01:07:28,419 --> 01:07:30,796
Neither his family nor his loved ones
could recognize him.

821
01:07:31,839 --> 01:07:33,090
It's too big of a punishment.

822
01:07:36,594 --> 01:07:39,221
You're right. It is.

823
01:07:40,890 --> 01:07:42,183
We should pray

824
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:45,895
that those we love will still recognize us

825
01:07:46,395 --> 01:07:48,898
even if we have a different name
and appearance.

826
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:01,952
What is it?

827
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:05,122
Someone I knew...

828
01:08:06,707 --> 01:08:08,459
prayed about something similar.

829
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:10,169
Really?

830
01:08:11,378 --> 01:08:14,465
I hope their prayer will be answered.

831
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,388
Isn't the sunset here beautiful?

832
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:24,475
This is my favorite time of the day.

833
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,186
The sun will set soon.

834
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,021
Can the interview wait?

835
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:32,942
Sure. Of course.

836
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:41,158
This world is still unfair.

837
01:08:41,742 --> 01:08:46,038
But that gorgeous, golden sunset

838
01:08:47,248 --> 01:08:48,999
is fair to everyone.

839
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,128
I am able to appreciate
and love this moment.

840
01:08:53,754 --> 01:08:54,713
And that makes me rich.

841
01:08:56,423 --> 01:08:59,760
Come and purchase a golden spoon.

842
01:08:59,927 --> 01:09:04,557
You can become rich with just 30,000 won.

843
01:09:05,057 --> 01:09:07,893
Come and purchase a golden spoon.

844
01:09:08,018 --> 01:09:11,480
Switch your parents,
and your life will completely change.

845
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:14,567
I'll only charge you 30,000 won today.

846
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:17,862
You can become rich
by changing your parents.

847
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,864
Check out this golden spoon.

848
01:09:23,534 --> 01:09:24,493
Ah.

849
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:32,668
You must want to become rich too.

850
01:09:33,794 --> 01:09:34,753
What do you say?

851
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:40,676
Will you seize this opportunity?

852
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:46,348
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING THE GOLDEN SPOON
