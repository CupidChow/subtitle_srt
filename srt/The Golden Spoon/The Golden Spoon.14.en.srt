00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,323
JUNE 13, 1982

2
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:36,661
DOSIN GROUP AFFILIATES
ADOLESCENT FRIENDSHIP DAY

3
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:49,132
SUNGEUN E&G
GWON YOHAN

4
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:52,260
Isn't that Hyeondo?

5
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:04,939
SUNGEUN E&G
GWON YOHAN

6
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,192
You must be Yohan.

7
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:10,904
I heard your father's company
is doing the best out of our affiliates.

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,490
It's nice to meet you. I'm Hwang Hyeondo.

9
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:17,410
Hwang Hyeondo.
The future leader of Dosin Group.

10
00:01:20,288 --> 00:01:22,749
Do remember my name
since we'll become best friends.

11
00:01:25,794 --> 00:01:27,253
-Miyeon.
-Hyeondo.

12
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,381
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

13
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,180
One, two, three.

14
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,141
They're engaged.

15
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:42,727
-Engaged?
-I'm so upset.

16
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,106
I would have been Hyeondo's fiancée
had I been a bit older.

17
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,525
Hey, kid.

18
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,776
You could even wed him now

19
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,445
if your father's company's market cap
was as big as hers.

20
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:55,490
I see. As in, the winner takes all?

21
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:58,034
I know that much.

22
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:00,161
I always come in first place
at piano competitions.

23
00:02:04,374 --> 00:02:05,208
Where are you going?

24
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,337
He didn't even ask for my name.

25
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,256
Y CRAM SCHOOL FOUNDATION
SEO YOUNGSHIN

26
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,925
He's handsome.

27
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:18,096
Should I take it for you?

28
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:21,474
One, two, three.

29
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,395
One more.

30
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,274
One, two, three.

31
00:02:40,618 --> 00:02:43,538
All right, look at the camera.

32
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,624
-Are you doing well?
-Did you smile?

33
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,251
-One more.
-Look at the camera.

34
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,420
Smile like you did at home, okay?

35
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,671
You can do it, right?

36
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,006
Okay.

37
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:55,341
Oh. What a good boy.

38
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:56,968
I'll take one more.

39
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:58,094
Okay.

40
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,723
-Look at him.
-I'll take it now. One, two, three.

41
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:06,144
Hyeondo, you shouldn't be
attending painting auctions right now.

42
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,979
Today's contract costs 200 billion won.

43
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,522
So what?

44
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,065
I'm going to miss my flight.

45
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,026
That's enough.

46
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:17,655
Our Japanese clients are waiting.

47
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,658
You can always attend Christie's again.

48
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:22,327
Think of all the hard work…

49
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:27,248
that we put into this
to pull off the deal.

50
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:28,708
You mean "you?"

51
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:32,253
Did you think I wouldn't know
that you were using me as a front

52
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,173
to manage Dosin to your liking?

53
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:37,967
In the end, it's still your company
and your money!

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,639
I hope you can be wise

55
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,058
and set your priorities straight.

56
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:49,771
Wise? Okay.

57
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,690
Then, Gwon Yohan.

58
00:03:52,774 --> 00:03:55,985
From this moment on, you're fired.

59
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,821
I am sick and tired

60
00:03:58,905 --> 00:04:00,573
of money-grubbers like you.

61
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,205
Hey, Hwang Hyeondo!

62
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,502
Fine. I'll quit if you want me to.

63
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:16,547
But given the years we've spent together,

64
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,591
let's at least have a meal
before parting ways.

65
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,303
Sure. Do as you wish.

66
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,114
Hyeondo.

67
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:44,742
In the end, you've lost.

68
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:51,082
I was wondering where you were.

69
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,294
EPISODE 14

70
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:56,379
A gift from your friend, was it?

71
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,463
Yes.

72
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,841
You can say that.

73
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,844
A golden spoon
for someone as wealthy as you.

74
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:05,179
Gutsy, I'll give him that.

75
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,058
He was smart and competent.

76
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,102
But too greedy.

77
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:12,645
Too greedy?

78
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,064
He wanted everything that was mine.

79
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:19,027
Dosin Group, my wife,

80
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:23,364
and even my name, Hwang Hyeondo.

81
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:25,908
How brazen of him.

82
00:05:27,118 --> 00:05:28,328
He's even worse than your son.

83
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,457
Your son is the most
fearless person that I know.

84
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:38,129
Uh, did I offend you by comparing your son

85
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,048
to your friend?

86
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,215
Not at all.

87
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:45,678
Come to think of it,
I can also see a striking resemblance.

88
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:55,021
I'm sure I was with Seungcheon.

89
00:05:55,104 --> 00:05:58,107
What are you doing here?

90
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,194
Juhee.

91
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:03,363
It's me, Seungcheon.

92
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:04,947
What?

93
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,785
Are you really Seungcheon?

94
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,168
I guess we were switched
just for our birthday.

95
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,129
What will you do now?

96
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,881
I should look for Taeyong first.

97
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,145
What's going on? Why am I here?

98
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:37,855
What in the world happened?

99
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,733
You returned to Hwang Taeyong yesterday.

100
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,611
What do you mean?

101
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,198
Explain.

102
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,844
I have absolutely no idea what's going on.

103
00:07:27,196 --> 00:07:29,699
YOU WILL PAY FOR THE LUCK
YOU HAVE RECEIVED FOR FREE

104
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:33,119
As if I had much luck to begin with.

105
00:07:41,002 --> 00:07:43,838
If Hwang Hyeondo
isn't my father like you said,

106
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:45,339
then who is my real father?

107
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,066
What are you guys doing at this hour?

108
00:08:07,153 --> 00:08:08,946
I called him over to talk about something.

109
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:10,740
I see.

110
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,536
Have you thought about the offer
I made last time?

111
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,331
Ah. About working for Dosin?

112
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:25,546
No, thank you.
I want to do something that I enjoy.

113
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,758
Goodbye, then.

114
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:30,843
I'm off.

115
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,179
Wait…

116
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:43,814
Do you have something to say to me?

117
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,903
Never mind.

118
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,157
It's nice to see you.

119
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,217
Yes.

120
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,178
I'm glad you're back in your place.

121
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,029
Taeyong must not have seen
his golden spoon.

122
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:37,743
But then again,
he wouldn't have recognized it.

123
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,883
I've become

124
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,761
Hwang Taeyong once again.

125
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:22,830
A golden spoon?
What nonsense are you spewing?

126
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:24,957
That idea came
from Seungcheon's imagination!

127
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,917
This is just ridiculous, I'm leaving!

128
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,128
-You must be afraid.
-What did you say?

129
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:31,339
Of discovering the truth
that you didn't know.

130
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,343
I understand.

131
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,722
You can have this.

132
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,141
I don't need it anymore.

133
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,360
But aren't you curious

134
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:54,862
about what your son, Lee Seungcheon did?

135
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,143
Hey.

136
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,437
You're home.

137
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:29,480
Why are you so late?

138
00:11:29,563 --> 00:11:32,274
I met up with a friend.

139
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:34,235
Why are you drinking?

140
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,487
-Is something the matter?
-Not at all.

141
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,406
Come sit.

142
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,620
Oh, dear.

143
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,665
It's okay. This will do.

144
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,879
Dad.

145
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:57,258
Next time, drink with me
instead of drinking alone.

146
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,468
Okay?

147
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,054
Sure.

148
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:04,473
-Good night.
-Night.

149
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:07,685
Seungcheon.

150
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,981
I love you, my son.

151
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:16,527
I love you too, Dad. You should go to bed.

152
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,654
Okay.

153
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,110
Could I have just one meal?

154
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,197
This will be enough to pay off your debt.

155
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,075
I can just help them as Hwang Taeyong.

156
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:49,495
Why in the world did you do such a thing?

157
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,084
This is the power of 10,000 won.

158
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,878
You should've just continued
pursuing your dream.

159
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,421
Why would you do this?

160
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,174
Dad.

161
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,724
Sir, please let it slide. It's my dad…
He's really ill.

162
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,060
-Is it a sin to not have money?
-It is!

163
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,604
It's the most miserable sin of them all!

164
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:19,316
Seungcheon…

165
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,995
Why won't you eat?
Eat and become Hwang Taeyong!

166
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,292
Are you happy
that you abandoned them to become rich?

167
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,086
In that case, you can be Hwang Taeyong.

168
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:42,131
Why did you do it?

169
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,901
TRANSFER OF SHARES AGREEMENT

170
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:03,819
TRANSFERER: SEO JUNTAE
TRANSFEREE: HWANG TAEYONG

171
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,237
Seeing how Juntae...

172
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,532
signed this in a heartbeat,

173
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,534
he must have been desperate.

174
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,079
Wait there for a minute.

175
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:22,796
Hwang Hyeondo.

176
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,592
Does he even know
that Taeyong isn't his biological son?

177
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,763
Judging by how he pushed him
to compete against Seo Juntae,

178
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:33,641
he may have known already.

179
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,367
People are talking about
how you won't stop opposing

180
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,618
the physical division.

181
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,164
Will you keep going against my word?

182
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,044
I heard you demanded
a way to stop the short-selling

183
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:03,337
at yesterday's meeting.

184
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,258
I just wanted the executive members
to be on their toes.

185
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,303
Plus, there's no reason for me
to be against the physical division.

186
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,681
What benefits you benefit me as well.

187
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:17,518
I will do as you say.

188
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:20,354
The press and the shareholders
are criticizing your actions.

189
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,022
What will you do about that?

190
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,235
I won't do anything.

191
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:29,947
What do you mean?

192
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,907
All they do is reflect what you do.

193
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:35,786
If I remain quiet about it,
they'll calm down as well.

194
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,706
Not dealing with them is my strategy.

195
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,876
You finally sound...

196
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:45,504
like my son.

197
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,633
Let's meet in the lobby in an hour.

198
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,719
There's a place I want to take you.

199
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,235
Mr. Lee.

200
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,738
Hey, Seung… Taeyong.

201
00:17:11,572 --> 00:17:13,532
What brings you here?

202
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,410
I was passing by
and thought I'd visit you.

203
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,787
-Really? I'm honored.
-Yes.

204
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,372
Have you had lunch?

205
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:22,875
-If not, should we grab--
-Taeyong.

206
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:29,256
Hello, sir.

207
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,844
We meet again. What brings you here?

208
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,600
Can we go?

209
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:41,560
Yes.

210
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,437
We're running late. Let's go.

211
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,397
Well then.

212
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:47,775
Let's go.

213
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,819
I'm sorry, I'll call you later.

214
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,284
You don't need to, Seungcheon.

215
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,674
He's my son.

216
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:21,975
What's wrong?

217
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,853
Is something bothering you?

218
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:27,856
No, nothing.

219
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,068
Where are we going?

220
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:33,946
-The Blue House.
-The Blue House?

221
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:36,323
They're holding
a business roundtable today.

222
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,075
I'm going to introduce you as my heir.

223
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,286
Father.

224
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,580
I've already started the preparations
for your succession.

225
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:47,126
This is my birthday gift to you.

226
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,104
Welcome, President Hwang.

227
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,480
-Hello.
-This way, please.

228
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,744
-Hello.
-Hello.

229
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:31,336
THE BLUE HOUSE

230
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:38,010
Long time no see, President Hwang.

231
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:39,720
How have you been?

232
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,471
I've been well
thanks to you, Mr. President.

233
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:44,099
I brought my son with me today.

234
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,436
It's an honor to meet you.

235
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,896
I'm Hwang Taeyong of Dosin Group.

236
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,398
You're one lucky father

237
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,193
to have such a handsome son.

238
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,662
You can't get me out of here?
What do you mean?

239
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:07,831
Are you kidding me?

240
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,584
President Hwang said
that you had no choice

241
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,337
but to lie low--

242
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:17,883
This was his plan all along.

243
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:19,676
He just wanted my shares.

244
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:23,055
He never planned to get me out of here.

245
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:27,309
How could he do this to me?

246
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:29,561
Those shares
originally belonged to his son.

247
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,980
It's only right to give them back.

248
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,440
What did you say?

249
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,781
That's enough!

250
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:44,785
Let me go!

251
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:47,663
I'll make him pay.

252
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,040
Do you think I'll just sit here
and take it?

253
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:51,875
Never!

254
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,211
He'll pay for this.

255
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:55,879
Let's go!

256
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:57,506
Come!

257
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:04,263
Ma'am! Oh, no!

258
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:05,764
Call Attorney Go this instant.

259
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,266
No, call my husband.

260
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,726
I want my Juntae out of there right now!
Call him!

261
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:13,438
Ma'am, please put that down.

262
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,232
Right now!

263
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:16,692
Call my husband right now.

264
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,528
If you don't, I'll just kill myself.

265
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:20,737
I'm not playing!

266
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,532
This won't kill you, ma'am.

267
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,909
Let me go. Who are you to butt in?

268
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:28,036
If you truly care about your brother,

269
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:29,538
this isn't right.

270
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:34,167
If something were to happen to you,
he will no longer have anyone by his side.

271
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,091
You're in pain
because you can't do anything for him.

272
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,845
Isn't that why you're torturing yourself?

273
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,559
Let me have this.

274
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:58,066
Ms. Gong, please get her
a hot towel and some tea.

275
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,526
Okay.

276
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,404
-Thank you.
-Yes.

277
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,958
My dear Juntae...

278
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,128
means the world to me.

279
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:21,882
He went through so much.

280
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:27,512
He had to survive in the States
all by himself without his mother.

281
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:32,225
I should be the one to protect him.

282
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:36,271
I'm so sorry that
my heart feels like it will explode.

283
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:38,565
I have a younger brother as well,

284
00:22:39,316 --> 00:22:41,735
but I'm not as ardent about him like you.

285
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:44,571
I feel bad for him,

286
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,740
but my children come first.

287
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:51,536
Right? All mothers are like this, right?

288
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,415
I mean…

289
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:58,460
I empathize with you.

290
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,339
Right.

291
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,513
Today will be our last delivery here.

292
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,475
-Why?
-President Hwang

293
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,811
hurt my husband deeply.

294
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,689
Even poor people like us

295
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,901
want to protect our pride.

296
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,154
We have our own flowerbed.

297
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,199
And President Hwang trampled all over it.

298
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:33,537
So do you think I'd want to keep
delivering food for someone like him?

299
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:39,876
It must feel great
to be able to say everything you want.

300
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:44,131
I should at least do that
if I have no money.

301
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,177
Can I say one more thing?

302
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:51,805
Why aren't you using honorifics?

303
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,598
Having money
doesn't entitle you to do that.

304
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,686
Thank you for everything, ma'am.

305
00:23:58,895 --> 00:23:59,896
Goodbye.

306
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:08,029
Yes, thank you.

307
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,452
DOSIN GROUP'S FAMILY TREE

308
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:15,203
DOSIN GROUP'S FAMILY TREE

309
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,166
HWANG HYEONDO
PRESIDENT OF DOSIN GROUP

310
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,460
I wonder who my biological father is…

311
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:24,171
HA MIYEON

312
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:27,382
Was she my mom?

313
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,178
I'm sorry, Mom.

314
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,431
I'm sure you loved me.

315
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:38,977
But I don't remember you.

316
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,317
JUHEE
CAN WE MEET UP?

317
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,526
Can we meet up?

318
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,070
What? Seriously?

319
00:24:49,654 --> 00:24:51,406
How did you know I needed a new wallet?

320
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,158
Of course I knew.

321
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,994
I got you that wallet
in senior year in high school.

322
00:24:56,077 --> 00:24:59,414
I assumed you'd get a new one eventually,
but you never did.

323
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:00,874
So I got you one instead.

324
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:03,835
Thanks.

325
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:07,464
By the way, is this it?

326
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,883
There's nothing more? No?

327
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,053
I'm just playing.

328
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:15,931
Thanks.

329
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,517
Taeyong.

330
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,359
I found out about everything that happened

331
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,319
between you and Seungcheon.

332
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:33,907
Juhee.

333
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:36,326
I couldn't believe it actually happened.

334
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,912
I still can't.

335
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:44,042
But I know that you're Taeyong.

336
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,548
It feels surreal.

337
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:52,968
Because I don't remember
living as Hwang Taeyong.

338
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:56,263
Do you not remember anything at all?

339
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:01,226
What kind of person was I
as Hwang Taeyong?

340
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:04,604
What about my mom? What was she like?

341
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:24,291
I'm so relieved. I truly am.

342
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:27,836
You're back to being Hwang Taeyong, right?

343
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,674
Yeojin.

344
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,051
There's something I want to tell you.

345
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,469
What is it?

346
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:41,141
Are you going to call off our engagement
like Hwang Taeyong did?

347
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,935
If that's it, just leave!

348
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,312
Yeojin.

349
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:51,359
I was thankful that you stayed by my side
when I was going through a hard time.

350
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,987
And…

351
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,408
I truly wanted to love you.

352
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:00,869
But…

353
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,169
…I think this is as far as we go.

354
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:12,297
Let's break up, Yeojin.

355
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,966
I won't let you go.

356
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,010
Did you forget
that I have your golden spoon?

357
00:27:17,093 --> 00:27:20,096
What if I give it to your parents?

358
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,473
Yeojin.

359
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,058
I trust you.

360
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,727
Oh Yeojin is… No.

361
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,228
Jeong Nara...

362
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,065
is a softhearted girl.

363
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,485
She would never do such a thing.

364
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:38,073
I trust her.

365
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:49,709
What do I do?

366
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,755
The golden spoon.

367
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:56,424
I need to find it.

368
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,635
I have to find it.

369
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,392
You threw it away?

370
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,518
What did you expect?

371
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,563
Did you think
I'd bring that golden spoon with me?

372
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:12,774
Mr. Lee.

373
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,069
You ate with that spoon, didn't you?

374
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,414
Then I'll make it short
since you probably know already.

375
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:31,292
You know you should be careful
about what you say to Seungcheon, right?

376
00:28:31,418 --> 00:28:34,379
Don't tell him that you know everything
or that I gave you that spoon.

377
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,673
Don't worry.

378
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,134
I won't say a thing.

379
00:28:41,136 --> 00:28:42,470
I knew it.

380
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,683
You love Seungcheon
more than anybody else.

381
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,297
Yes, it was her.

382
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:21,217
She may have changed her hairstyle
and may seem different,

383
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:25,722
but she was the lady
who gave me that suitcase full of money.

384
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,099
I've seen her on TV recently too.

385
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,980
Thank you for confirming it.

386
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,859
Ask her for the money.

387
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:39,319
I don't have it.

388
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,616
Where did you spend all that money?

389
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,534
Didn't you lose your golden spoon?

390
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,246
You're a strange one.

391
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:53,583
Whenever I talked about the golden spoon,

392
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:57,420
people always said that I was crazy.

393
00:29:57,879 --> 00:30:01,132
But you seem to believe me.

394
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,927
I do.

395
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:09,516
I was actually

396
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:13,019
the daughter of a very wealthy family.

397
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:17,065
I lived in a 150-pyeong penthouse
in Cheongdam-dong.

398
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,236
But I must have been insane.

399
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,323
Why was I so hung up on my first love?

400
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,412
It turned out

401
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:35,291
that my housekeeper's husband
was my first love.

402
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:38,878
I used my golden spoon to find him.

403
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,506
But that bastard

404
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:45,009
ended up selling it.

405
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,679
Damn it!

406
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:52,851
If I could,
I'd go back to being Geum Sukja,

407
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:55,520
the district councilor of Gangnam.

408
00:30:55,603 --> 00:30:57,188
But that's not possible, right?

409
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:03,194
Would you still go back
even if she was poor?

410
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,948
Are you crazy? Why would I if she's poor?

411
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,950
I'd never go back in that case.

412
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:38,980
Hey.

413
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,399
So you'll be released on parole?

414
00:31:41,983 --> 00:31:43,526
I'll send you some food.

415
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,947
Something to suit
the young master's taste.

416
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:50,325
That's not enough.

417
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,702
Didn't you say you'd treat me?

418
00:31:52,785 --> 00:31:54,996
What?

419
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:58,791
So?

420
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,418
I'd like to take you up on that offer.

421
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:01,920
And of course…

422
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:05,089
…you won't be doing it for free.

423
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,095
Okay, all right.

424
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:13,473
Juntae.

425
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,267
Don't worry.

426
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,070
I want a divorce.

427
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,325
Why? Are you scared?

428
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:39,666
Someone like you who hates to lose face
will never get divorced.

429
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:42,919
Just tell me what you want.

430
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,337
Don't beat around the bush.

431
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,548
Why did you marry me?

432
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,593
You neither wanted kids nor loved me.

433
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,930
Why did you marry me if you were going
to look down on me all your life?

434
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:58,476
Did you marry me
so that you could torment Juntae?

435
00:33:01,479 --> 00:33:02,605
Because of the resemblance.

436
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,192
You resemble Miyeon.
That's why I married you.

437
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,027
I'm sure you knew that.

438
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,784
Sure. We do have something in common.

439
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,454
Allowing scumbags into our lives.

440
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,749
Hwang Hyeondo and Gwon Yohan.

441
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:33,511
You know,
I've met my fair share of bastards.

442
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:34,804
But the worst ones...

443
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:37,390
were Gwon Yohan

444
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,976
and Hwang Hyeondo.

445
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:42,270
You.

446
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:06,794
A background check on President Hwang?

447
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,881
I wouldn't go as far as to call it that.

448
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:14,010
I just think I should know
what kind of life he's led.

449
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:19,682
You asked me to do this last time as well.
Why do you want to look into him?

450
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:24,353
-When did I?
-On your birthday.

451
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:27,899
You wanted to know what your father
was up to the night President Na died.

452
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,525
Do you not remember?

453
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,320
Right. I remember.

454
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,572
Anyway, please just do as I ask.

455
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:36,991
Yes, sir.

456
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,502
It was Taeyong.

457
00:34:48,795 --> 00:34:50,630
He ordered Munki to do so.

458
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:56,052
What did he want to find out?

459
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:10,900
What about my mom? What was she like?

460
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,402
Your mom

461
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,697
was a beautiful woman
who always smelled nice.

462
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:20,326
And you really missed her.

463
00:35:32,588 --> 00:35:33,631
I'm sorry, Mom.

464
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,136
I can't help but feel a bit curious
about my birth mom.

465
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:42,765
And my birth dad.

466
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,768
One, two, three.

467
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,311
That was a good one.

468
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:48,688
-Your turn.
-No, thanks.

469
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:51,149
-Come on.
-It's okay.

470
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,733
-Should I?
-Yes.

471
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,447
-Do I look nice?
-Yes.

472
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:01,033
It feels nice to be out.

473
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:03,327
Honey.

474
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:08,374
Let's go out every now and then

475
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:11,085
and have fun like others do.

476
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,800
I'm sorry, honey.

477
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,345
I put you through so much.

478
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,848
I wanted you to live more comfortably--

479
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:28,269
Please, I'm as happy as I can be.

480
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,396
You're here by my side,

481
00:36:30,479 --> 00:36:32,315
and our children grew up well.

482
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:36,277
We're healthy and can work.
What more can I ask for?

483
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:40,865
Honey, you are…

484
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,912
…the greatest gift of my life.

485
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,585
Thanks, honey.

486
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:53,920
Like you said,

487
00:36:55,087 --> 00:36:57,590
let's go out
and enjoy the change of seasons.

488
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,258
And with Sungah and Seung…

489
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,180
Seungcheon.

490
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:08,935
Let's be happy together.

491
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:14,065
What's the matter?
You're getting teary-eyed. Are you crying?

492
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,861
Right, honey.
Did you spend all the money I gave you?

493
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,905
Did you?

494
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,909
I'm not giving you
more allowance until you do. Okay?

495
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,119
I'm serious.

496
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,913
Isn't that Seungcheon?

497
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:31,082
-Yes, I called him.
-What?

498
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:32,500
Seungcheon!

499
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,627
-Mom.
-Hey.

500
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,379
-Dad.
-My son.

501
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,838
Hey.

502
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,674
What do you want for dinner?

503
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,384
Let's eat something tasty and go singing.

504
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,677
-Okay.
-Really?

505
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,345
Yes.

506
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:45,596
What should we have?

507
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,057
-Hmm, kimchi stew.
-Again?

508
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,850
-Yes.
-Sungah.

509
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,353
-Hey, there wasn't any traffic?
-No.

510
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,938
-You came pretty quick.
-I'm so hungry.

511
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:55,106
You're hungry? Let's go eat.

512
00:37:55,189 --> 00:37:56,691
-Where?
-Let's get chicken feet.

513
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,025
-What do you want?
-Chicken feet?

514
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,485
-Chicken feet?
-Yes.

515
00:37:59,568 --> 00:38:01,362
Jokbal? Or pork belly?

516
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:02,571
-With soju?
-Pork belly.

517
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,823
Nothing has changed.

518
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:07,952
That kid is not my son.

519
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,415
All I have is my dear Seungcheon.

520
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,377
I'll live happily with him.

521
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,464
Dad, come on. Let's go.

522
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,049
Honey, aren't you coming?

523
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,926
Yes, I'm coming. Let's go.

524
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,053
-Hurry up.
-Let's go.

525
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,638
Let's go.

526
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:30,391
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

527
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:36,063
♪ With my beloved family ♪

528
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:38,065
♪ I'll have a drink ♪

529
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,151
Can you stop singing that song?

530
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,069
Why? I like it.

531
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,447
-What do you mean?
-You can enjoy it all by yourself.

532
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:45,489
-Okay.
-Okay.

533
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:48,367
I was a good singer when I was young.

534
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:52,747
Taeyong.

535
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:56,292
Hey, what are you doing here at this time?

536
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,337
I was wondering why
your father came by our office today.

537
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,755
He did?

538
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,798
-Hmm?
-Uh…

539
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,009
I couldn't come empty-handed, so…

540
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,138
No, thanks. Take that back and leave.

541
00:39:09,764 --> 00:39:12,767
Dad, what's wrong?
He was pretty thoughtful.

542
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,310
I never asked you to buy me that.

543
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,270
So why did you?

544
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,105
Honey, what's the matter?

545
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:19,315
Stay out of this.

546
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,316
Fine.

547
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:23,569
I stopped by today
to confront your father.

548
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,989
But I just left because I didn't think
he was worth my time. Okay?

549
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:29,325
Father, what's going--

550
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,951
Don't call me that!

551
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,496
Don't you dare come back here again.

552
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,124
I'm sick of both you and your father,
so leave this instant!

553
00:39:38,626 --> 00:39:39,668
Taeyong.

554
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,545
-Honey.
-Dad.

555
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:53,432
You're acting strange.

556
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,645
What did Taeyong ever do to you
to make you so furious?

557
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,398
He did do something.

558
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,609
He's a selfish brat.

559
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,987
He doesn't even care about his parents.

560
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,866
Honey.

561
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,536
Mom, what's gotten into him?

562
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:34,306
You should stop coming by unannounced.

563
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,142
You're Hwang Taeyong, after all.

564
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,478
I understand that you miss your parents.

565
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:41,188
But this isn't right.

566
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:43,941
They're not your family anymore.

567
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:45,860
You should go.

568
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,802
Which color would you like to try?

569
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,556
-That one.
-Okay.

570
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:17,933
I want to stand out.

571
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,061
-"I want to stand out."
-Close your eyes.

572
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,858
Open them. Do you like it?

573
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:32,531
How long will you stand there like that?
Do you have something to say?

574
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:36,243
I made a list of decent agencies

575
00:41:37,203 --> 00:41:38,704
that would like to work with you.

576
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,164
Pick one.

577
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,750
HU ENTERTAINMENT

578
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:46,378
What are you trying to pull?

579
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:50,299
You said you want me out of your life.

580
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:52,843
I'll cancel our contract.
I hope you'll be well.

581
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,261
I'm sure you will.

582
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,600
Park Janggun.

583
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,981
-Hey.
-Hey.

584
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,149
Yeojin is in there.

585
00:42:08,067 --> 00:42:11,529
Na Juhee, why can't you
just like Seungcheon like you did before?

586
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:13,489
Stop tormenting...

587
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:15,950
my dear Yeojin.

588
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:31,799
What do you think about this dress?
Does it suit me?

589
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:35,219
I'm sure you didn't call me here
to help you pick a dress.

590
00:42:36,053 --> 00:42:37,096
Why did you want to see me?

591
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:44,895
Taeyong and I will get married.

592
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,648
So stay away from him.

593
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,443
I'm sure you meant Seungcheon.

594
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:54,697
I know everything.
I know that he's actually Seungcheon,

595
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:58,158
and that you're Jeong Nara.

596
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,664
Is that so?

597
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,209
Then you must know this too.

598
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:11,046
That Seungcheon will never give up
on being Hwang Taeyong.

599
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:12,631
I heard you two went to the sea.

600
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:15,050
Did he confess his love to you
or something?

601
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,387
Do you think that one kiss
will bring you back together?

602
00:43:18,470 --> 00:43:19,930
Don't hold your breath.

603
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,142
If you think he and I weren't intimate
during our ten years together,

604
00:43:23,225 --> 00:43:24,643
you're awfully mistaken.

605
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,186
You don't know him.

606
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,939
He will never go back
to being the poor Lee Seungcheon.

607
00:43:29,023 --> 00:43:29,898
He will.

608
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,151
Maybe not right now.

609
00:43:34,028 --> 00:43:35,779
But if he's the Seungcheon I know,

610
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:38,949
then he will return to his old self.

611
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:41,702
I believe in him.

612
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,000
Don't make me laugh.
Things won't go your way!

613
00:43:57,176 --> 00:43:58,469
Just wait and see, Na Juhee.

614
00:44:00,220 --> 00:44:02,264
You'll soon realize that I was right.

615
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,156
Seungcheon.

616
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,576
Hey. Do you know how worried I was?

617
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,244
You weren't picking up. Where…

618
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:26,455
have you been?

619
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,918
-Is something wrong?
-Yes.

620
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:34,588
I'm hungry.

621
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,679
The instant noodle is ready.
What are you doing?

622
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:43,222
I'm sure I put it here somewhere.

623
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,723
One minute.

624
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,230
The noodles are going to get soggy.
Let's eat first.

625
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:52,731
Come on.

626
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,655
Are you okay?

627
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,073
Sorry.

628
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:04,660
What are these?

629
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,412
You still have tapes?

630
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:08,497
They were my dad's.

631
00:45:09,123 --> 00:45:10,666
I wanted to keep them for his sake.

632
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,259
Let me.

633
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:26,807
-What is this?
-Huh?

634
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,684
Here's the album.

635
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,770
-Let's eat first.
-Okay.

636
00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,482
Your mother was so beautiful.

637
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,401
-Right? Wasn't she pretty?
-Yes.

638
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,902
So you take after your dad.

639
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,113
What?

640
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,072
Hey.

641
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:46,577
-You were bigger here.
-Yes.

642
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,707
That's Dongkyung.

643
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,001
Yes. Dongkyung and Jaedon.

644
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:56,628
Gosh, time flies.

645
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,213
It does.

646
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:29,870
Taeyong took your place,

647
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,915
and you took Taeyong's.

648
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,129
Seungcheon.

649
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,508
You still have one last chance
to meet the old woman, right?

650
00:46:43,425 --> 00:46:44,802
Which choice will you make?

651
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,849
You don't want me to live
as Hwang Taeyong, do you?

652
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,978
What I want doesn't matter.

653
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,274
But if you want to know,

654
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,195
I want you to come back
to being Lee Seungcheon.

655
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:05,197
Why should I?

656
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:07,574
Because you're Seungcheon.

657
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,205
I have no plans of doing that.

658
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:15,290
And Taeyong agreed
to live as Lee Seungcheon.

659
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:19,711
Seungcheon, can you really abandon
your parents and me

660
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,004
to live as Hwang Taeyong?

661
00:47:21,088 --> 00:47:22,965
I'm not abandoning any of you.

662
00:47:23,048 --> 00:47:25,133
I'm just abandoning my name.

663
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,764
Juhee, the past ten years as Hwang Taeyong

664
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,599
weren't easy for me.

665
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:36,770
I have dreams and ambitions
I want to pursue as Hwang Taeyong.

666
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:38,689
That's why I must do this.

667
00:47:38,772 --> 00:47:40,983
Don't lie. It's all because of money.

668
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,068
You can sugarcoat it all you want,

669
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,863
but you of all people know
that it's because of money.

670
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:46,905
Am I wrong?

671
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:51,326
Yes.

672
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:52,536
It's all because of money.

673
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:58,458
Is that so wrong?

674
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:28,614
Goodness.

675
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:32,159
I feel so relieved
that you two reconciled.

676
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:36,038
Hey, you guys are old
and have no other friends.

677
00:48:36,663 --> 00:48:38,123
You shouldn't fight, you know?

678
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:40,459
This is all because of Hwang Taeyong.

679
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:44,338
Dosin Hightech is in a mess
due to the short selling.

680
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,674
Don't be fooled by Taeyong just because
he buys your food and treats you well.

681
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,885
He's just using you.

682
00:48:51,553 --> 00:48:53,805
Using me? What for?

683
00:48:56,224 --> 00:48:57,768
I read this in a stock discussion forum.

684
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,479
Apparently, President Hwang isn't
the reason why Dosin grew so much.

685
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:04,149
Rumor has it that his friend
laid the groundwork.

686
00:49:04,858 --> 00:49:08,362
Taeyong is trying to leech off of you
since he knows you're smart.

687
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,571
You'd better watch out.

688
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,199
Jeez. That's it?

689
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,910
Who was the friend? Someone famous?

690
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:16,328
No.

691
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,040
He was from an affiliate of Dosin.
What was his name again?

692
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,250
Right. Gwon Yohan.

693
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,794
-Gwon Yohan?
-Yes.

694
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,838
I heard those two were very close.
I wonder what he's up to these days.

695
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,343
Gwon Yohan?

696
00:49:44,648 --> 00:49:45,857
You bastard!

697
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:00,288
Why you little…

698
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,125
How dare a murderer

699
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:04,918
talk to me like that?

700
00:50:19,266 --> 00:50:20,684
You murdering bastard!

701
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,110
EMERGENCY
MINISTRY OF JUSTICE

702
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:36,283
"CNP Capital."
What kind of company is this?

703
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:37,784
That's not important.

704
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,953
It's just a paper company
for a secret account.

705
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,625
Becoming the owner of Dosin...

706
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,129
requires you to have many secrets.

707
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:51,965
Having secrets I can share with you

708
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,675
makes me happy.

709
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,511
Sign it.

710
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:08,398
I want you to come back
to being Lee Seungcheon.

711
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,033
HWANG TAEYONG

712
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:44,351
SEUNGCHEON'S DAD

713
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,193
Hello, Father. It's me.

714
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:57,489
Okay. I'll see you there this evening.

715
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,533
Bye.

716
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:09,918
How does your son look?

717
00:52:11,545 --> 00:52:15,006
Just look at my son.
Hey, you look incredible.

718
00:52:16,258 --> 00:52:18,301
I told you I didn't need a suit.

719
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,678
I already have one.

720
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:22,430
Don't be ridiculous.
You just have that cheap one.

721
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,432
Whether you decide to draw or get a job,

722
00:52:24,516 --> 00:52:26,309
you need a good suit.

723
00:52:26,393 --> 00:52:29,062
I wanted to get you a good one myself.

724
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:31,731
How much is this?

725
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,191
This way, please.

726
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,610
You look amazing.

727
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:57,215
Yes, you looked incredible.

728
00:52:57,632 --> 00:52:59,509
-Didn't it suit me?
-It sure did.

729
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:04,556
But Mom gave you that money
for you to spend.

730
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,892
You shouldn't spend it all on the family.

731
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,727
I spent it however I wanted.

732
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:11,271
Hey, didn't you say you had plans today?

733
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,398
I'll take this home. You should go.

734
00:53:16,193 --> 00:53:18,361
-Okay. I'll see you at home.
-Okay.

735
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,698
Lee Seungcheon!

736
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:25,452
Don't be mistaken.
Do you know why I refuse to eat?

737
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,329
Because I don't want to lose...

738
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:29,497
the best parents

739
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,917
in the world.

740
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:33,418
Seungcheon.

741
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:35,503
Yes?

742
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:53,730
Thank you, my son.

743
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,570
Thank you, and I'm sorry.

744
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,657
I'm thankful and sorry.

745
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:13,792
Dad.

746
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,169
What's wrong?

747
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:20,006
Huh?

748
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:22,884
I'm going through male menopause.

749
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:25,512
That's why I get emotional so easily.

750
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:28,056
How about some soju tonight?

751
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:30,392
With Mom's kimchi stew, are you down?

752
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:34,562
Deal. I'll get going then.

753
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,782
I'm sorry, Taeyong.

754
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,286
Let me see Seungcheon
for the last time today.

755
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:53,665
I'll consider you
my only son from then on.

756

00:55:11,891 --> 00:55:13,059

-Hello.

758
00:55:13,143 --> 00:55:14,227
May I see...

759
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,897
Mr. Gwon Yohan, please?

760
00:55:18,773 --> 00:55:19,941
Hello, honey.

761
00:55:20,775 --> 00:55:23,695
Did you just hear that Juntae
got a stay of execution of his sentence?

762
00:55:27,699 --> 00:55:30,160
Are you aware of what you just did?

763
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,203
What's the point of having money?

764
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,040
I'm going to let him rest comfortably
at the hospital.

765
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:38,710
I ought to do that much as his mom.

766
00:55:38,793 --> 00:55:42,672
You don't know your son one bit
as his mom.

767
00:55:42,756 --> 00:55:46,885
Juntae murdered four people in the States.

768
00:55:46,968 --> 00:55:48,887
What? What do you…

769
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,765
Don't you dare lie--

770
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,475
I don't care
whether you believe me or not.

771
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,062
Do you know what the bigger issue is?

00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:47,320
You should be at the hospital.

780
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,239
Why did you escape?

781
00:56:51,574 --> 00:56:54,035
Let's meet. I have something to say.

782
00:56:54,577 --> 00:56:56,579
I can't do that. People are watching.

783
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:58,957
How could you do this to me?

784
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:00,667
You said you'd get me out.

785
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,502
You promised to hand Dosin over to me.

786
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:06,172
That's not what I said.
I said I'd give you an opportunity.

787
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:09,592
Why are you doing this to me? You…

788
00:57:10,135 --> 00:57:11,469
You were the only one I trusted.

789
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,347
You said I was doing well.

790
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,391
You said I was fit to be your heir.

791
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,893
You said that you wished
you had a son like me!

792
00:57:18,977 --> 00:57:20,979
That's right, I did. However…

793
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:25,608
I had...

794
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,445
a change of heart.

795
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:32,866
Why do you think
I chose Taeyong as my heir?

796
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:34,742
Juntae.

797
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:38,538
Look at yourself.

798
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:41,749
You couldn't wait one month in prison,

799
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,294
whereas Taeyong waited a decade.

800
00:57:44,711 --> 00:57:47,630
For that reason alone,

801
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,259
he's more than eligible to be my heir.

802
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:54,762
You lost to him.

803
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,474
Go back to the hospital,

804
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,434
and I'll turn a blind eye to your escape.

805
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:03,438
This is all that I can do for you.

806
00:58:03,521 --> 00:58:04,647
Don't be ridiculous.

807
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,524
I'd rather die than stay in prison.

808
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,110
Hyeondo.

809
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:10,445
Hyeondo!

810
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,198
HYEONDO

811
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:16,159
Sir, where are you going
that you're not taking me?

812
00:58:16,242 --> 00:58:17,869
I have an important appointment.

813
00:58:19,787 --> 00:58:21,456
By the way, you should get a haircut.

814
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,374
Let me see.

815
00:58:24,375 --> 00:58:27,337
Maybe the hairstylist lacks skills.
Is something troubling you these days?

816
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,588
I see some gray hairs.

817
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:30,215
I recently cut my hair.

818
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:33,092
We still have a lot of pass fee
from Sungah's hair salon.

819
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,260
You should go there.

820
00:58:34,636 --> 00:58:35,887
And take it easy.

821
00:58:37,430 --> 00:58:39,724
I think you're the one
who needs a haircut.

822
00:58:54,447 --> 00:58:55,490
Hyeondo.

823
00:58:57,033 --> 00:58:58,785
You're mistaken for thinking
that Taeyong won.

824
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,497
Juhee! Juhee!

825
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:06,292
Hey, a journalist
at the police station just told me.

826
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:09,295
Seo Juntae caused a scene
and was taken to the hospital.

827
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:10,213
What?

828
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,090
And this has been embargoed,

829
00:59:12,173 --> 00:59:14,342
but rumor has it
that he escaped from the hospital.

830
00:59:17,929 --> 00:59:19,722
Mr. Jeong Euinam can't be paroled?

831
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:27,397
All right.
I'll head to the law firm right now.

832
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:37,198
What's your relationship
with Jeong Euinam?

833
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:38,741
Dad.

834
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,912
You've been sending money
to a man who used to pay us rent.

835
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,998
Why are you treating him so well?

836
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:48,084
I've already met with him,
so you'd better come clean.

837
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:51,462
-He's Jeong Nara's dad.
-What?

838
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:54,507
He came to our house last time
because he missed her,

839
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,925
and I reported him.

840
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:57,844
I felt bad, so I decided to help him out.

841
00:59:59,554 --> 01:00:02,140
Then you should have told me so.

842
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:04,267
What if your future in-laws
get the wrong idea?

843
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,060
You shouldn't take care of him yourself!

844
01:00:07,395 --> 01:00:09,314
-I didn't think that far.
-Jeez.

845
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,858
Then you should take over for me.

846
01:00:11,941 --> 01:00:13,818
Me? Must I?

847
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:16,404
Of course!

848
01:00:16,779 --> 01:00:18,990
Since I brought it up,
I'll take care of it.

849
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,992
Let me do it. Don't concern yourself.

850
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,248
How did he find out?

851
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:32,795
And why in the world did that man
get into a fight in prison?

852
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,804
Hey, over here.

853
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:57,320
Look.

854
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,491
I'm pretty good at grilling meat.

855
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:04,035
If you keep flipping them over,

856
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,413
it makes them less tasty.

857
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,123
Do you want a drink?

858
01:01:09,207 --> 01:01:10,083
Sure.

859
01:01:14,462 --> 01:01:17,423
I'm sorry about last time.

860
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:20,593
Let me.

861
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,138
I don't know what came over me.

862
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:29,060
You must have been hurt.

863
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:31,020
It's okay.

864
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:34,941
I saw the article.

865
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,318
So you're taking over your father
as his heir?

866
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:40,488
Right.

867
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,281
Gosh, this is wonderful.

868
01:01:43,157 --> 01:01:45,827
My son's friend
is from the wealthiest family in Korea.

869
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:48,579
It sure is amazing, Taeyong.

870
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,416
Can I brag about you to my friends?

871
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:53,543
Of course.

872
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,336
Cheers.

873
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,429
Give me a call when you meet your friends.

874
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:07,098
I'll treat you to something tasty

875
01:02:07,181 --> 01:02:08,224
and pay for everything.

876
01:02:09,434 --> 01:02:10,643
-Really?
-Yes.

877
01:02:11,269 --> 01:02:14,188
I'm happy just by hearing that.

878
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:17,316
Have another glass.

879
01:02:20,194 --> 01:02:24,157
Taeyong, what does it feel like
to live with a golden spoon in your mouth?

880
01:02:30,538 --> 01:02:32,165
It's nothing special.

881
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:35,418
We all have our ups and downs in life.
Being rich doesn't make you an exception.

882
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:39,172
Still, I'm sure
there's something that's different.

883
01:02:39,464 --> 01:02:41,382
I'm sure there are things
that are different

884
01:02:41,466 --> 01:02:43,092
that dirt spoons like me don't know about.

885
01:02:45,052 --> 01:02:46,137
Uh…

886
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:52,894
Do you know what Seungcheon
wanted to be growing up?

887
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,607
Becoming rich?

888
01:02:58,191 --> 01:03:00,193
No, a poet.

889
01:03:00,276 --> 01:03:01,569
He wanted to become a poet.

890
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,451
Do you know what this is?

891
01:03:09,243 --> 01:03:14,165
He wrote this poem
in third grade, and it's called…

892
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:15,208
FREE

893
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:18,503
"Free." That's the title.

894
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,048
I'll read it for you, so have a listen.

895
01:03:23,424 --> 01:03:24,467
"Free."

896
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,302
"By Lee Seungcheon."

897
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:30,556
"My teacher told me
that nothing in life was for free."

898
01:03:31,557 --> 01:03:33,351
"But there are many free things in life."

899
01:03:33,768 --> 01:03:35,978
You breathe for free.

900
01:03:36,604 --> 01:03:38,314
You talk for free.

901
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:41,150
You smell the flowers for free.

902
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,778
You look at the sky for free.

903
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,239
You age for free.

904
01:03:46,447 --> 01:03:48,866
"You listen to the breeze for free."

905
01:03:49,408 --> 01:03:51,327
"You smile for free."

906
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:54,413
You dream for free.

907
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:56,749
You watch ants for free.

908
01:03:59,043 --> 01:04:00,294
Isn't this poem amazing?

909
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,964
This was Seungcheon.

910
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:07,760
He was a very kind and warmhearted kid.

911
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:12,723
I'll give this to you.

912
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:18,229
Don't forget this kind heart of his…

913
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:22,942
as you become a competent businessman,

914
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:25,236
Taeyong.

915
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:54,223
SEO JUNTAE

916
01:04:54,807 --> 01:04:56,434
Excuse me for a minute.

917
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,440
Seo Juntae.

918
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:04,942
How did you get out?

919
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,652
That doesn't matter.

920
01:05:09,488 --> 01:05:10,865
What matters is why I got out.

921
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,495
Did you think you and Hwang Hyeondo

922
01:05:16,579 --> 01:05:18,748
would get away with making me
President Na's murderer?

923
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,961
Making you? Don't be absurd.

924
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,755
You turned yourself in.

925
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:27,381
Because Hyeondo told me to.

926
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:29,342
He said he'd bail me out.

927
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,261
I didn't kill President Na. I didn't.

928
01:05:33,054 --> 01:05:35,973
I'll make it short.
You have your father to resent.

929
01:06:00,331 --> 01:06:03,000
Are you okay?

930
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:07,880
Seungcheon.

931
01:06:13,844 --> 01:06:14,804
Are you okay?

932
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,348
You're not hurt?

933
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:19,433
Dad?

934
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:24,939
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

935
01:06:25,564 --> 01:06:28,025
No, don't talk. Just stay still.

936
01:06:28,359 --> 01:06:31,278
Help! Is anyone there?

937
01:06:34,198 --> 01:06:36,867
Seungcheon, don't be in pain.

938
01:06:37,660 --> 01:06:38,869
I'm okay.

939
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:43,749
I don't care what your name is.

940
01:06:47,294 --> 01:06:50,548
I will always love you.

941
01:06:52,258 --> 01:06:53,467
Because you're my son.

942
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,225
I'm glad

943
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,644
I could call you

944
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,522
by your name

945
01:07:07,732 --> 01:07:08,983
again.

946
01:07:24,206 --> 01:07:26,542
Dad.

947
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:29,128
Dad.

948
01:07:29,211 --> 01:07:32,173
Dad. Dad! Dad!

949
01:07:32,715 --> 01:07:34,383
Dad! Dad!

950
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:39,847
Dad!

951
01:07:43,851 --> 01:07:45,186
Dad!

952
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,540
SPECIAL THANKS TO KIM JAECHUL
AND SONG DAEUN FOR THEIR GUEST APPEARANCES

953
01:08:06,624 --> 01:08:08,626


954
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,770
-What have I done?

955
01:08:27,853 --> 01:08:29,980
-Who did that to my dad?

956
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,732
Why?

957
01:08:32,525 --> 01:08:34,777
-The one who ruined your life

958
01:08:34,860 --> 01:08:36,487
wasn't me, but your mom.

959
01:08:36,570 --> 01:08:38,447
-He used the golden spoon
to become Hwang Hyeondo.

960
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:41,117
-You alone will pay for all those sins.

961
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,743
-Do you want to be Lee Seungcheon again?

962
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,745
-I'm going to attack my father.

963
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,330
-You leave me with no choice.

964
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:49,041
I'll have to get rid of your old self.

965
01:08:49,125 --> 01:08:50,793
-You're a monster.
