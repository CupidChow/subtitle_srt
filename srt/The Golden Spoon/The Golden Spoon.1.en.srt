1
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:41,916
What about this one, ma'am?

2
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:48,715
Everyone is equal.

3
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,469
Jesus, Buddha,

4
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:56,014
Marx, and Gandhi all said the same.

5
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:57,682
It's expected to surpass…

6
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,559
The International Monetary Fund predicts

7
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:02,062
that Korea's economy will grow

8
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,814
at a rate of 4.5% this year, in 2011.

9
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,484
The Constitution says the same.

10
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,694
BASIC RIGHTS SPECIFIED IN THE CONSTITUTION

11
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:12,280
However, everyone knows

12
00:01:12,614 --> 00:01:15,366
that it's not the case in real life.

13
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,911
Everyone is seated the same way

14
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,954
in the same uniform,

15
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:22,165
but this place is…

16
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,335
Korea is

17
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,712
a hierarchical society.

18
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,843
The world is dominated by those
born with a golden spoon in their mouths.

19
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,595
Park Janggun,
the Army Chief of Staff's son.

20
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:36,596
Net worth, 200 billion won.

21
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,349
Oh Yeojin from Oh Construction.
Net worth, 300 billion won.

22
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,101
Kwon Minho,
the Sungbin Hospital director's son.

23
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:42,102
Net worth, 100 billion won.

24
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:44,104
Jeong Yunsu, the Jeong and Kim Law Firm
Senior Partner's son.

25
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,730
-Net worth, 100 billion won.
-And

26
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:49,150
the golden spoon of the golden spoons…

27
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,408
Hwang Taeyong, son of
President Hwang Hyeondo of Doshin Group,

28
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,787
the second largest company in Korea
with market value of 300 trillion won.

29
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,755
See you.

30
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,756
Bye.

31
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,968
Isn't that Taeyong's car?

32
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:18,054
I wonder how much that is.

33
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,264
-I'll text you.
-Okay.

34
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:20,431
-Bye.
-Bye.

35
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,184
The story of someone
going from rags to riches?

36
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:24,435
That's an old-time fairy tale.

37
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,733
QUICK DELIVERY

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,454
Hello.

39
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,415
Excuse me, coming through.

40
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,208
Excuse me.

41
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,961
Your food is here. I'm sorry.

42
00:02:50,044 --> 00:02:51,212
-Let me take that.
-Okay.

43
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:55,258
-What took you so long? I'm starving.
-I'm sorry. There was a lot of traffic.

44
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:01,848
If we use this formula,

45
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,851
minus AC here.

46
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:07,687
It should be less than zero
or equal to it, right?

47
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,355
In this case, look.

48
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:13,276
So we are going to solve it
by using this formula.

49
00:03:13,526 --> 00:03:14,611
Then how are we…

Hey, part-timer.
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,259
Show me your ID, please.

66
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,761
Look at your attitude.

67
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:25,765
Hey, I'm obviously not a minor.

68
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:27,558
Hurry up and give me a pack.

69
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,019
-Why you…
-Hey!

70
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:31,312
I was joking.

71
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:34,816
Shouldn't you be working right now?

72
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,609
You're working darn hard, aren't you?

73
00:04:37,652 --> 00:04:39,070
Look. My mom got these for me.

74
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:40,655
-Aren't they from the magazine?
-Right.

75
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,991
You'll let me borrow them, right?

76
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,909
Are you kidding me? No way.

77
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,160
Wow.

78
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,204
Such a cheapskate.

79
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,249
I knew our friendship was this shallow.

80
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:54,377
Who was there for you as you whined
about transferring to a technical high?

81
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,462
Then again, I shouldn't treat
the only other student

82
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,465
on the socially vulnerable admissions
program at Seoul Jeil High like this.

83
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:01,217
Okay!

84
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,847
You can keep these.

85
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,432
Forget it.

86
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,559
You shouldn't put shoes on the counter.

87
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:10,893
I was kidding.

88
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,235
I mean it.

89
00:05:21,571 --> 00:05:22,697
Keep them.

Park Jinseok, what's with you?

91
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,545
It was a joke. I'm not crazy, you know.

92
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,213
Why would I give these to you?

93
00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:41,382
You looked darn serious just now.

94
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:43,676
I'll be going then. Good luck.

95
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,345
Why, that little…

96
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,266
Welcome.

97
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,819
I'll take these.

SORRY FOR LEAVING YOU WITH A DEBT.

No.

-Jinseok, no.
-You shouldn't do this.

115
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,764
-No, Jinseok!
-Stay away.

116
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,975
-Move back.
-Jinseok! No.

117
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,103
Jinseok!

118
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,524
No… Jinseok, no.

119
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,281
You rotten pieces of trash!

120
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:14,535
You should've paid me back
before you chose to die.

121
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,579
Or at least left your brat alive
to pay me back.

122
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:18,664
Why did you kill yourselves altogether?

123
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:21,209
What am I supposed to do now?

124
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:25,171
You pay me on your brother's behalf.

125
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:27,048
I can't live without that money!

126
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,717
-I can't live without it!
-They're unbelievable.

127
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,136
What's wrong with them?
I mean, people died.

128
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,973
It's not the people,
but the money that died.

129
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:39,602
Goodness. Poor Park Jinseok.

130
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,320
Seungcheon!

131
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:52,532
You guys are so loyal to each other.

132
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,075
Is it because you're both poor?

133
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,247
Hey, let's hurry and eat first.
The noodles might get soggy.

134
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,042
-Hey, look. Aren't these crazy?
-What is it?

135
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,335
They're so cool.

136
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:07,421
If I graduate from SNU
and get a job at Doshin Group,

137
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,839
I'll buy you a pair.

138
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:12,593
Becoming a billionaire myself
might be faster, my friend.

139
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:13,803
-You think so?
-Jeez.

140
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,514
-It hurts.
-You too?

141
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,474
Don't make me laugh.

142
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:28,484
NO TO REDEVELOPMENT

143
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,403
-There!
-He's coming!

144
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:36,200
Some say Doshin's
forced demolition caused these deaths.

145
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,535
Do you have any comments?

146
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,745
Do you think Doshin is responsible
for their deaths?

147
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:43,416
Do you have any plans to reconsider
the redevelopment in Samin-dong?

148
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,627
First of all, I'd like to express
my sincere condolences.

149
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,299
I'm not here
as the president of Doshin Group.

150
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,176
I'm here today as a father myself,

151
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,555
to mourn over the death
of my son's classmate.

152
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,516
Excuse me.

153
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:04,812
What about punishing the person in charge
and compensation for the late family?

154
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,149
Are you here because you officially admit
to being responsible?

155
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,693
Must they have high school seniors
attend an occasion like this?

156
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:11,736
Of course not.

157
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:14,655
My mom said nothing is for free.

158
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,035
Janggun, let's think of this as the price
we pay for good student records.

159
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:19,994
-Okay?
-Right.

160
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,580
-Hey, it's Lee Seungcheon.
-What?

161
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,582
Hey, Lee Seungcheon!

162
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,335
This is going to be fun.

163
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:33,799
Hey, Underdog. I'm glad to see you.

164
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,093
You did a poor job
on my assessment last time.

165
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,011
You little…

166
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,099
Seungcheon, I got a B.

167
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,770
Why couldn't you do the money's worth?

168
00:10:45,853 --> 00:10:48,522
Hey, hold on. Jinseok's dead now,

169
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,524
so he's the only
underprivileged in our school.

170
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,526
You're right.

171
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:55,613
Why did Jinseok have to die like that?

172
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,239
What an insult to our school.

173
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,825
I mean, it's the most prestigious
private high in this country!

174
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,037
Park Janggun.

175
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,081
That's too much.

176
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,000
-How scary.
-Was it too much?

177
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,586
No, not at all.

178
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,546
Was it too much?

179
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,716
I don't think so.

180
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,427
What's there to advertise
about committing suicide together

181
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,430
while holding out against the demolition?

182
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:27,019
What are you glaring at, you bastard?

183
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,688
Are you pissed that I'm running him down?

184
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,607
All right, punch me then.

185
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,276
Punch me.

186
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,404
I said, punch me!

187
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,782
I want nothing more than to punch you,

188
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,118
but I won't.

189
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,120
Because I have no money.

190
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,455
If I punch you,

191
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,126
it will cost me money.

192
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,338
Hey, he sure knows his place.

193
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,675
This is why I like him.

194
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:02,763
But I think I'll hit you a few times.

195
00:12:03,764 --> 00:12:04,765
Why?

196
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:07,476
Because I have lots of money.

197
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:10,104
Because you would

198
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,816
do anything for money.

199
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,569
Hey.

200
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,364
All right, Seungcheon.
It's time to settle up.

201
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,451
Here's 50,000 won. 10,000 won per slap.

202
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:27,204
Satisfied?

203
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:41,218
Park Janggun.

204
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,220
What are you doing?

205
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:44,221
Taeyong.

206
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,517
Are you done paying your respects?
I was waiting for you.

207
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:49,643
Why would you wait for me?

208
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,687
We didn't agree to meet up.

209
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,899
Well, I just wanted to say hi.

210
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,696
What are you doing, Underdog?

211
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:02,907
-Go.
-Underdog?

212
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:05,493
Is that his name?
I thought it was Kim Seungcheon.

213
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:08,788
Taeyong, it's Lee Seungcheon, not Kim.
His surname is Lee.

214
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:12,082
Oh, right. Lee Seungcheon.

215
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,419
Lee Seungcheon,
what happened to your face?

216
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,713
Did you cry?

217
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,635
Were you close to Kang Jinseok?

218
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,553
-He was.
-Taeyong.

219
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:27,014
It's Park Jinseok, not Kang.
You know, the surname Park…

220
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,225
Don't mind him. He's just tactless.

221
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:37,191
Anyway, my father paid for the funeral.
Make sure they rest in peace.

222
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,235
Bye.

223
00:13:40,611 --> 00:13:41,737
Behave yourself.

224
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,990
-Taeyong!
-I'll be watching you.

225
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:46,200
Behave.

226
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:48,828
Wait for me.
You know my full name, right?

227
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,941
Taeyong, you must be tired.
Take care. Bye.

228
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,734
-Take care.
-Hey.

229
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,488
-Hello!
-Hello!

230
00:14:26,073 --> 00:14:27,950
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

231
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,288
I'm sorry, Father.
I needed to talk to my friends.

232
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,415
Your friends?

233
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,253
Is he your friend too?

234
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,596
Yes, he's one of my classmates.

235
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,892
Taeyong, what do you think a friend is?

236
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:53,809
Pardon?

237
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:58,772
Well, a friend is…

238
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,859
A friend spends time with you.

239
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:06,030
You share each other's time.

240
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:10,367
Your time must hold the same value
for you to be friends.

241
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,288
You'll be leading Doshin Group
worth trillions of won in the future.

242
00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:17,416
How valuable do you think
an hour of your time is?

243
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,840
It's 4,580 won per hour,
and I work four hours a day for six days.

244
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,217
So that'd be 439,680 won, right?

245
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,762
NA JUHEE

246
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,388
"Lee Seungcheon."

247
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:34,850
Seungcheon.

248
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:41,899
Your name is Lee Seungcheon, right?

249
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:43,359
What's on your mind?

250
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,782
I taught you how to use the POS machine.

251
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:52,159
If the calculations don't add up,
you'll have to pay for it.

252
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,578
Tell the boss
if anything needs to be restocked.

253
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:56,455
Don't I have to sign a contract?

254
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,959
The boss might ask you
to bring your parents' written consent.

255
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:00,918
You okay with that?

256
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,171
It seems you ran away from home.

257
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:06,757
Any questions?

258
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:09,218
-No, right?
-I have one.

259
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,182
What happened? Did you get hurt?

260
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,524
Don't you want to work here
for a long time?

261
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,653
Then mind your own business.

262
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,542
Welcome.

263
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,678
Don't let it get to you.

264
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,056
And one more piece of advice.

265
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,267
Don't smile at customers
as you did just now.

266
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,936
Why shouldn't I do that?

267
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,524
You'll get exhausted if you keep smiling.

268
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,808
"You'll get exhausted
if you keep smiling."

269
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:45,522
Is it his thing to act cool or what?

270
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,073
He actually is a little cool.

271
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,869
-Goodbye.
-We have heartbreaking news.

272
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:02,081
Yesterday, a family of three
was found dead in a house

273
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,167
in the redevelopment area which will soon
be demolished by Doshin Construction.

274
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,587
The police are assuming
that the family was financially unstable

275
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,380
and ended up committing suicide together.

276
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:12,591
The details are currently
under investigation.

277
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,051
It's heartbreaking to know

278
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,969
-that when they were found…
-Isn't that house…

279
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:18,472
…a box of new sneakers was placed
next to their son

280
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,224
-who went to a prestigious high school.

281
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,059
More from Reporter Hyun Moonsik.

282
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:22,976
DARLING DAUGHTER

283
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,311
Despite the struggles…

284
00:18:24,394 --> 00:18:25,562
Yes, Sungah.

285
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:29,191
Mom, we have a problem.
The landlord is here again.

286
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:31,944
Goodness.

287
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:37,491
We'll pay you the money,
so get out of here, okay?

288
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,159
-You little…
-Calm down.

289
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,287
You said you'd pay me double
if I put off three months' rent.

290
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,497
You can't say otherwise now.

291
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:45,833
Pay you twice the rent?
That doesn't even make sense!

292
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,668
Who said that crap?

293
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,754
Ah. You didn't know?

294
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:53,423
Your father said that crap.

295
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:55,300
-My dad did?
-And he said

296
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,220
he wouldn't be late making payment
because he was a famous comic artist.

297
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,972
I looked him up online.

298
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:02,808
There's no webtoon artist
named Lee Cheol. Explain this.

299
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,435
I apologize. I'll wire the money
as soon as I get my advance.

300
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,020
Be quiet!

301
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:10,190
We're not getting out of here
until your husband comes, got it?

302
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,859
-Guys, camp out.
-Yes, sir.

303
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:15,195
Let me lie down.

304
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,072
Goodness.

305
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,907
Mom, Seungcheon's here.

306
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:22,286
Seungcheon, you're home.

307
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,917
He's not even saying hello.

308
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:30,669
So what if he goes to Seoul Jeil High?

309
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,296
He's completely rude.

310
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:40,053
Did you say you were waiting for my dad?

311
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,640
He's here.

312
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,437
Dad, what are you doing there? Come out.

313
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:49,980
What?

314
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:52,941
Hey.

315
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:57,529
And you'd get nothing from searching
Lee Cheol the webtoon artist.

316
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,990
He used to draw comics for rentals
more than ten years ago.

317
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:09,875
What are you, a cockroach?
What were you doing there?

318
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,922
Have you read "True Colors of Shaolin?"

319
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:17,090
It sold 100,000 copies.

320
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:20,969
I'll let you guys talk.

321
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:28,936
FIFTY THOUSAND WON

322
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,064
Seungcheon. It's time to settle up.

323
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:33,649
Here's 50,000 won.

324
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,193
Ten thousand won per slap.

325
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:43,700
Are you insane?

326
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:47,621
I know you hate Dad,
but how could you do that?

327
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,625
What? I didn't know you had money.

328
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,043
No, this is mine.

329
00:20:53,126 --> 00:20:54,253
I went through hell for this.

330
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:56,296
Your money is your family's money.

331
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,048
We can pay our rent with this.

332
00:20:58,131 --> 00:20:59,341
That won't solve the problem.

333
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:01,760
Our debt amounts to 400 million won!

334
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,096
Why did he even stand surety
when he had no money?

335
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:06,640
He didn't know uncle would go bankrupt.

336
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,141
He's just too kind.

337
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,184
Wake up.

338
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,311
It's going to take forever
to pay off that debt.

339
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,648
Your internship at the salon pays 550,000.
Mom waits tables to earn 1.8 million.

340
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:16,566
-That's hardly enough.
-So?

341
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,362
You'll go live your life
with the money you earned.

342
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,738
-Is that it?
-I've done enough.

343
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,615
Every time I got paid, I helped our family

344
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,450
with the overdue rent,
utility bills and such.

345
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:28,912
I'll find a way to survive myself,
so stay out of my business.

346
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,665
Get out!

347
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:34,876
Get out!

348
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,670
Why that little…

349
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,630
Hey.

350
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,840
Hey!

351
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,342
Open the door while I'm asking nicely.

352
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,178
Open the door!

353
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,057
Lee Seungcheon.

354
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,225
Lee Seungcheon!

355
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:56,189
Mom, what is wrong with him?

356
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,735
It's probably because of Jinseok.

357
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:01,528
What about him?

358
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,617
Why aren't you saying anything?

359
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:09,911
Jeez.

360
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:13,582
URGH

361
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,045
BEING POOR IS A SIN…

362
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,257
SLAM

363
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:23,800
FARTING DOESN'T COST MONEY

364
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,226
STINKY GAS FOR FREE, BAD BREATH ON ME!

365
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:34,144
HAAAAA

366
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:36,313
This is awesome.

367
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,815
This deserves to be serialized.

368
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,817
Who's the artist? "Lee Cheol?"

369
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,403
You read webtoons every day,

370
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:45,947
and now you even read those
of aspiring webtoon artists?

371
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,449
If the president finds out--

372
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,910
That is why I called you over
to stand watch.

373
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,411
Tell me as soon as Mr. Kang calls.

374
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,622
It's Gong, not Kang.

375
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,290
Why don't you call his name correctly?

376
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,792
Kang, Gong, whatever.

377
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,713
Did you finish reading
what the president told you to?

378
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,342
-The McKinsey report?
-Yes.

379
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,886
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

380
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:16,353
STINKY GAS FOR FREE, BAD BREATH ON ME!

381
00:23:49,469 --> 00:23:50,303
MCKINSEY REPORT

382
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,306
MCKINSEY REPORT
MARKET EVOLUTION

383
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:59,020
It took too much time to summarize.

384
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:03,483
Actually,

385
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:06,862
I couldn't finish reading it.

386
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,115
I see.

387
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,203
Right.

388
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,789
You just didn't have enough time.

389
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,708
Only if you'd had enough time,

390
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:24,045
you wouldn't have shown me
this lousy piece of trash.

391
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,514
Use your chances wisely to prove yourself

392
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,643
because you may not always be given
another chance.

393
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,232
Father.

394
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,484
Of course,

395
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,155
it's up to you to waste your chances.

396
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,118
But you'll have to take responsibility.
You know that, don't you?

397
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:57,829
Mark my words.

398
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,747
WHAT IS JUSTICE
PARK JANGGUN

399
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:43,667
I'm at Taeyong's place,
so bring the homework there.

400
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,794
Let's see if you did the money's worth.

401
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,254
He's a nasty jerk.

402
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,397
You really are something, Park Janggun.

403
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,608
Why did you call Lee Seungcheon over?

404
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,860
I'm training that underdog.

405
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,946
He takes my money,
but he's not submissive enough.

406
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,601
You know I'm a huge fan of yours, right?

407
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,645
Yes, of course.

408
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:37,280
Taeyong, how did you like
your mom's performance today?

409
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:38,615
It was nice.

410
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,992
But it was a little too long.

411
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,870
I liked it though.

412
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,748
Yes, right. This piece is a little long.

413
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,209
Why don't you play a piece?

414
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,961
It's been a while
since I've heard you play.

415
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,298
I don't feel like playing the piano.

416
00:27:57,050 --> 00:27:57,884
Sorry.

417
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,018
You know Park Jiwon,
also known as Yeonam, right?

418
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:13,525
That novelist got this for me
on his way back from the Qing dynasty.

419
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:14,609
I see.

420
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,656
-What?
-Let me see.

421
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:23,243
He also got me a wool brush.

422
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:24,744
It must be somewhere here.

423
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,914
Here it is.

424
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,332
Yeonam wrote

425
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:32,377
The Jehol Diary with this.

426
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,588
You make funny jokes, ma'am.

427
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,549
Then what,

428
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,677
is this made of pure gold?

429
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,556
Yes, of course.

430
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,351
You can take it for 30,000 won.

431
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,229
Come on. Pure gold can't be 30,000 won.

432
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:53,648
You don't believe what I say?

433
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,276
That's not just any golden spoon.

434
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:58,987
Look.

435
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,030
GOLDEN SPOON THAT MAKES YOU RICH
30,000 WON

436
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:03,742
This golden spoon can make you rich.

437
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,577
Excuse me?

438
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,664
It's entirely possible
if you are willing to swap your parents.

439
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:11,958
Swap parents?

440
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:14,377
Go to the house of a boy your age.

441
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,172
Eat three meals with this spoon.

442
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,384
Then your life will be switched with his,

443
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:25,221
and his parents will become your parents.

444
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:28,641
How do you expect me to believe that?

445
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:30,852
Even if it's true,

446
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:32,729
who would choose to swap
their own parents?

447
00:29:34,355 --> 00:29:37,484
When you're at a crossroads,
you'll know what to do.

448
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:39,319
What do you say?

449
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:41,988
Don't you want to become rich?

450
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,344
Lee Seungcheon?

451
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,222
I've never seen him before.

452
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,478
Uh, I called him over.

453
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:58,106
He's here to do an errand for me.

454
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,359
Did you bring it?

455
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,075
WHAT IS JUSTICE

456
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:13,913
Good job.

457
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,458
You may go now.

458
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:39,814
Wait.

459
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,569
You're a guest too.
I shouldn't let you leave like this.

460
00:31:47,113 --> 00:31:48,156
Prepare a seat for him.

461
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,701
Lee Seungcheon, eat before you leave.

462
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:14,098
What a lucky day for you, Underdog.

463
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:17,602
Taeyong, you could've just let him go
without feeding him.

464
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,354
He might make a habit of this.

465
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,315
Park Janggun, you called him over,

466
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,027
but this is my house. Knock it off.

467
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,992
So Lee Seungcheon,
what does your father do for a living?

468
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:38,498
He's a comic artist.

469
00:32:39,582 --> 00:32:41,000
Right now, he draws webtoons.

470
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,087
Really? I like webtoons.

471
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,633
-What did he draw?
-He hasn't been published, has he?

472
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:51,010
Isn't he just an aspiring webcomic artist?

473
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:52,387
An aspiring artist?

474
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,263
Your father's so irresponsible.

475
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,099
Considering his age,
it doesn't sound right.

476
00:32:56,182 --> 00:32:57,725
It's not right at all.

477
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:59,519
-He's selfish.
-Right.

478
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:02,438
Ooh. Wait. Not those.

479
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,482
Get him something else.

480
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,485
Seeing a golden spoon and chopsticks

481
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,654
might make this poor bum greedy.

482
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,157
You have ones made
with stainless steel, right?

483
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:15,576
Shiny stainless steel.

484
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,245
Those will do.

485
00:33:20,873 --> 00:33:22,000
Park Janggun.

486
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,129
I'm sorry, but I was raised with care too.

487
00:33:26,838 --> 00:33:27,672
When I eat,

488
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,883
I don't use just any spoons or chopsticks.

489
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:38,099
I'm quite treasured in my family, you see.

490
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,686
Thanks for the food, Taeyong.

491
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,689
Let's eat.

492
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:58,995
-Thanks for the food.
-Thanks.

493
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,433
What's this?

494
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:23,436
Look at this boy.

495
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,999
I must've been crazy.

496
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,543
I can't believe
I paid 30,000 won for this.

497
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,088
It was worth it, I guess.

498
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,145
What?

499
00:35:06,979 --> 00:35:07,814
Mom.

500
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,275
Sungah.

501
00:35:16,697 --> 00:35:18,574
Did the lights go out again?

502
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:29,961
Mom.

503
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:43,266
What are you doing?
Are you asleep already?

504
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,600
Sungah.

505
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:46,811
Dad.

506
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,439
Mom.

507
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:08,124
DEAR SEUNGCHEON… WE'RE SORRY

508
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,211
NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE THINK ABOUT IT,
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY

509
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:15,256
WE'RE REALLY SORRY.
OUR DEAR SON, SEUNGCHEON…

510
00:36:19,510 --> 00:36:21,179
No… It can't be.

511
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:24,557
Mom. No!

512
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:27,560
Mom. Dad. Sungah!

513
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,605
Dad. Mom, wake up.

514
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,357
Mom, open your eyes.

515
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,860
Mom, wake up. Mom.

516
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:37,486
No…

517
00:36:38,154 --> 00:36:40,907
No!

518
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:42,742
No…

519
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,744
No!

520
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,596
A 30,000-won golden spoon
that can make you become rich.

521
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,098
A weird old woman.

522
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:50,518
Eat three meals
at the house of a friend your age,

523
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:52,478
and your parents will be switched.

524
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,607
One month, one year,

525
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,234
ten years…

526
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:02,947
What do you say?
Don't you want to become rich?

527
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:11,580
DOSHIN GROUP

528
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,709
Doshin Constructions, Bio, Electronics…

529
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:16,877
And…

530
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:22,008
INTERVIEW OF PRESIDENT HWANG OF DOSHIN…

531
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:26,304
DOSHIN'S HWANG HYEONDO…

532
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,725
REPORTER: WHAT ABOUT WINE
DID YOU FIND INTERESTING?

533
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:32,310
PRESIDENT HWANG:
A DROP OF WINE IS MADE WITH THE HARMONY…

534
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,604
DOSHIN ELECTRONICS
MARKET CAPITAL: 127413.9 BILLION

535
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:37,398
HWANG HYEONDO:
THE PRESIDENT OF DOSHIN GROUP

536
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,150
HWANG TAEYONG:
A STUDENT AT SEOUL JEIL HIGH

537
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:55,875
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SUBPRIME
MORTGAGE CRISIS AND ITS IMPLICATION

538
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:01,380
Why does he want me
to write this stupid report?

539
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,591
We can just purchase buildings.

540
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,384
Why invest in REITs?

541
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,763
Probably because of the regulations.

542
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,516
If you invest in REITs,

543
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,685
you can hedge risk.

544
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,521
And separate taxation on dividend income
will get you a tax benefit.

545
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,523
Lee Seungcheon.

546
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,442
You're good.

547
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:24,195
Do you mind if I help you a little?

548
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:27,865
REITs usually make investments
in a form of property development

549
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:29,992
or purchase what's already been developed.

550
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:32,787
These charts show a gradual increase.

551
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:35,581
You're right.

552
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:39,418
I've checked some articles.
Urban housing took lead last year,

553
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,504
but this year,
profitable hotels are promising.

554
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:42,755
Profitable hotels?

555
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:45,383
Like business or tourist hotels.

556
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,427
We should look for a fund
that invests in such properties.

557
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,147
Isn't that Underdog?

558
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,649
What is he doing with Hwang Taeyong?

559
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,958
A. OVERVIEW AND CURRENT STATE
OF AMERICAN MORTGAGE MARKET

560
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:30,302
See?

561
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:32,972
You can do it.

562
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:40,062
I studied a case of investing in
logistics facilities in the US and Spain.

563
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,273
Already?

564
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,025
You're really good.

565
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,737
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

566
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,948
Here. Try this first.

567
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:54,118
Eat up.

568
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,964
NEW MESSAGE 001

569
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,763
DEPOSIT: 300,000, BALANCE: 1,105,351
FROM HWANG TAEYONG

570
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,604
HWANG TAEYONG: 300,000 WON
HWANG TAEYONG: 200,000 WON

571
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,612
You know what?

572
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,656
Poor people mistake kindness for a chance.

573
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,702
What do you mean?

574
00:41:36,785 --> 00:41:38,954
Lee Seungcheon seems
to mistake your kindness.

575
00:41:39,038 --> 00:41:41,040
I get what you mean.

576
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,875
But he knows where the line is.

577
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:44,960
That's a relief then.

578
00:41:45,377 --> 00:41:47,713
By the way, did you know that
Juhee came back from the UK?

579
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:51,175
I heard she got expelled.
Maybe something happened.

580
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:54,553
Why are you telling me this?

581
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,765
I just thought you should know.

582
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,601
I see.

583
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,063
Were you worried about me?

584
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:06,232
Why?

585
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:09,985
That,

586
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:12,947
I'm not so sure.

587
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,366
I think I know why.

588
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,661
OH YEOJIN

589
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,089
You seem cheap.

590
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,133
I don't know why,
but you give off that vibe.

591
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:34,635
Jeez.

592
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:52,027
SEOUL JEIL HIGH, SENIOR CLASS 2,
STUDENT NUMBER 19, LEE SEUNGCHEON

593
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,279
"Seoul Jeil High?"

594
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,698
Don't touch what isn't yours.

595
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,492
Sorry. Do you go to Seoul Jeil High?

596
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,703
Isn't that for students with top grades?

597
00:43:00,786 --> 00:43:04,123
For students with top grades
and lots of money.

598
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,667
That's not me though.

599
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:08,544
Which school do you go to?

600
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:09,461
Me?

601
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:10,963
I…

602
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,174
-You, young lady.
-I don't go to school.

603
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:15,884
-You are expelled from this school…
-I got expelled.

604
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,928
-…for disruptive and bad behavior.
-What? That's unexpected.

605
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:19,221
-Why should I be expelled?
-Why?

606
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:20,806
-I was just punishing them…
-For teaching bullies a lesson.

607
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:21,765
…for being racists.

608
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,142
But I don't regret it.

609
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,692
You should still get
a high school diploma.

610
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,653
A diploma is crucial

611
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:37,072
for the lives of poor people like us.

612
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,199
Without it,

613
00:43:41,535 --> 00:43:43,162
you can't survive in this country.

614
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:47,541
Seungcheon, your friend is here for you.

615
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:48,876
Okay.

616
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,172
Put those away properly.

617
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:13,275
Hwang Taeyong?

618
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:15,611
Here, take it.

619
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:17,905
-What is it?
-I wanted to get you a gift,

620
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:19,698
but I didn't know what you'd want.

621
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,951
Thanks to you, my father
commended me for the first time.

622
00:44:23,035 --> 00:44:24,203
You're silly.

623
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,205
You don't have to do this.

624
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,416
Just take it.

625
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,794
Accept your friend's good intentions.

626
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:35,130
-My friend?
-Yes, Seungcheon.

627
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:38,634
I know how to differentiate
what's real or fake.

628
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:41,261
Whether it's a painting,
a designer brand item,

629
00:44:42,596 --> 00:44:43,430
or a person.

630
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:48,310
And Lee Seungcheon, you're the real deal.

631
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:51,188
You're my real friend.

632
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:56,318
See you.

633
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:08,163
What on earth?

634
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,999
The two of them are close?

635
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:14,461
When you arrive, you'll take
your math lesson right away.

636
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:15,796
After essay writing and science,

637
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,923
dinner will be
with the French ambassador's family.

638
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,258
-After that--
-I envy him.

639
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,678
-Pardon?
-I envy Lee Seungcheon.

640
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,763
He gets to live as he pleases.

641
00:45:24,847 --> 00:45:28,016
He can sleep as much as he wants,
read webtoons freely,

642
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,352
and have a lot of free time.

643
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,947
He probably has a mom, too.

644
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,722
Today was the toughest day at work.

645
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,098
Already?

646
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:51,767
Tomorrow will be really tough.

647
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,144
New stock is coming in tomorrow.

648
00:46:54,228 --> 00:46:56,772
Oh, dear.

649
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,033
Please enjoy.

650
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,922
DAD

651
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:25,926
Is it your mom?

652
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,345
No, my dad. My mom passed away.

653
00:47:31,056 --> 00:47:33,600
I hung up because I knew
he'd nag at me to hurry home.

654
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:36,395
Hey, this is spicy and delicious.
Try some.

655
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,865
About the boy who came to see you earlier…

656
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:49,324
Are you friends with him?

657
00:47:50,409 --> 00:47:53,912
Friends? He's the son
of Doshin Group's president.

658
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,372
The golden spoon of golden spoons.

659
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:57,124
There's no way we can be friends.

660
00:47:57,207 --> 00:48:00,460
I think you're much better than him.

661
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:03,881
You make an effort to support yourself.
That's really admirable.

662
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,009
But you should smile a little.

663
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,763
On my first day, you said
I'd get exhausted if I kept smiling.

664
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,725
I got what you meant.

665
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:17,102
Even so, you need to smile a bit.

666
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,021
I saw you smile for the first time today.

667
00:48:21,815 --> 00:48:23,567
-Really?
-Yes.

668
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:29,615
Sauce was on your face.

669
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,575
Seungcheon, what's your dream?

670
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,452
What about you?

671
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,454
Me? Well…

672
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:38,498
A novelist.

673
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,751
My dream was to write
novels like Harry Potter.

674
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,628
Right now, I'm not sure. What about you?

675
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,255
I want

676
00:48:46,798 --> 00:48:47,674
to be rich.

677
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:50,719
To be rich? That's your dream?

678
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,972
I'll make lots of money and become rich.

679
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,433
What will you do then?

680
00:48:56,516 --> 00:48:59,436
Isn't it obvious? There will be
so many things I can do.

681
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,274
I'll go study abroad and travel.

682
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,069
I'll do anything I want.

683
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:10,948
Ah. I'll buy my mom an apartment too.

684
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:14,910
And when I become rich…

685
00:49:17,287 --> 00:49:18,997
When I become rich…

686
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:22,668
You should've paid me back
before you chose to die.

687
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:25,754
I will make sure to survive.

688
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:30,133
I will survive

689
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:35,681
and become rich.

690
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,036
SEOUL JEIL HIGH SCHOOL
CLASS EAGLE LIST

691
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:00,414
-Move it.
-Come on.

692
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,042
"Yunsu," nice!

693
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,253
"Lee Seungcheon!"

694
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,548
-Unbelievable.
-Park Janggun,

695
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,174
you're the only one not on the list.

696
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,301
-Good job.
-He was always good.

697
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:15,595
30TH: LEE SEUNGCHEON
31ST: PARK JANGGUN

698
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,807
What, "30th, Lee Seungcheon?"

699
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,435
Why is he…

700
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:28,984
After all that money

701
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:32,571
you took from me,

702
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,239
how dare you sock it to me?

703
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,458
You didn't mark the answers correctly.

704
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:47,210
Are you saying it's my fault?

705
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:49,379
Whatever.

706
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:53,300
Drop out of Class Eagle.
Then I can join the class right away.

707
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,010
-No, I can't do that.
-No?

708
00:50:55,093 --> 00:50:57,137
You're rich, and you have capable parents.

709
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:59,056
Class Eagle is all I have.
I must go to the SNU.

710
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,308
This bastard.

711
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:02,726
What are you saying?

712
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,519
-He's ridiculous.
-He's crazy.

713
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:07,898
Have you lost your senses
now that you hang out with Hwang Taeyong?

714
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:10,233
Seungcheon, nothing can change

715
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:14,237
the fact that
you are a dirt spoon for life.

716
00:51:18,116 --> 00:51:19,326
Go for it.

717
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:28,418
No matter what you say,

718
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,171
I will never give this up.

719
00:51:37,928 --> 00:51:38,887
Really?

720
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:43,892
Then I will make you

721
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:45,936
give it up.

722
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:04,246
You'd better wash that.

723
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,825
What brings you here at this hour?

724
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:25,869
What, did you get into a fight?

725
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:28,246
Ah. It's nothing.

726
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,877
I'm done with your investment report.

727
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,338
ASSET MANAGEMENT REPORT

728
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:41,885
Okay.

729
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,596
By the way, did you have dinner?

730
00:53:44,679 --> 00:53:48,183
Dinner? Of course.
It's way past dinnertime.

731
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:49,643
Is that so?

732
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:52,395
I'm a little hungry.

733
00:53:52,479 --> 00:53:54,856
Could I at least have
some instant noodles?

734
00:53:55,023 --> 00:53:56,274
Instant noodles?

735
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:20,215
Let's eat.

736
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:22,175
Okay.

737
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:46,408
Oh, my. Do you carry your own spoon?

738
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:48,952
You brought it again today?
That's pretty funny.

739
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,704
-Let me--
-Hey. No.

740
00:54:56,042 --> 00:54:58,920
Sorry. It's just that I'm really hungry.

741
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,049
Thank you for the food.

742
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,393
Honey.

743
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:16,146
Father.

744
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,072
Welcome home.

745
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:30,994
-Who is this?
-He's my classmate, Lee Seungcheon.

746
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,078
Lee Seungcheon?

747
00:55:40,837 --> 00:55:41,838
Ah.

748
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:44,466
I saw him at the funeral.

749
00:55:45,967 --> 00:55:49,637
Taeyong's friend said he was hungry.

750
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,097
Have you had dinner?

751
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:52,766
Friend?

752
00:55:58,188 --> 00:55:59,439
Taeyong.

753
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:04,152
I thought I explained enough
about what a friend is.

754
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:05,612
Pardon?

755
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,078
I must have forgotten.

756
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:19,667
Oh.

757
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,587
-Seungcheon, let's go.
-What?

758
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,256
-Come on.
-Well…

759
00:56:48,071 --> 00:56:51,950
I'm sorry, but go home for today.
I'll text you later.

760
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:52,992
Okay.

761
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:09,592
Wait.

762
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:58,892
I guess you were starving.

763
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:10,403
I apologize.

764
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,531
It's all right. You can have a seat
and take your time.

765
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:16,284
No, I'm done eating.

766
00:58:18,620 --> 00:58:19,704
Goodbye.

767
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,504
Hey.

768
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,478
You forgot to take your thing.

769
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:58,159
I hope you will never
bring something like this here.

770
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,161
Not that we'll see you again.

771
00:59:22,642 --> 00:59:23,935
Is it his first time here?

772
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:25,562
No, it's his second time.

773
00:59:27,188 --> 00:59:28,940
He's so repulsive, isn't he?

774
00:59:37,031 --> 00:59:39,158
CHIEF OF STAFF, PARK KIJU

775
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:41,661
Hello, Chief Park. How have you been?

776
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:46,207
Who? Is this Janggun?

777
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,125
Hello.

778
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,796
What is it that you have to tell me

779
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,465
about Taeyong?

780
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,683
What have I done?

781
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,102
I'm such an idiot.

782
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:26,914
Why does Father want to talk to me?

783
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:30,877
You sound very polite
when you need my help.

784
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,797
Let me tell you just one thing.

785
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,675
Beg him for forgiveness.

786
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,943
PROVIDING SERVICE AND PRODUCTS
TO VALUABLE CONSUMERS

787
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:15,213
You wrote that what caused
the subprime mortgage crisis

788
01:01:15,296 --> 01:01:17,965
was a credit default swap.

789
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,843
When you sell a lousy product
and it goes under,

790
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:24,305
is it right to sell

791
01:01:26,057 --> 01:01:27,433
profitable insurance?

792
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:29,852
Well,

793
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:31,979
it's not right.

794
01:01:36,150 --> 01:01:38,069
Is it right?

795
01:01:38,903 --> 01:01:40,446
I mean…

796
01:01:40,530 --> 01:01:42,198
There's no way you can answer me.

797
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,158
Because you didn't write this.

798
01:01:46,160 --> 01:01:48,579
Lee Seungcheon
wrote all the reports, didn't he?

799
01:01:49,997 --> 01:01:53,209
He did a good job
with this investment report too.

800
01:01:54,043 --> 01:01:57,380
I'm sorry, Father.
I wanted to be praised by you.

801
01:01:59,006 --> 01:02:00,216
That's why I did it.

802
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:02,635
I see.

803
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:06,889
Then you should've been careful

804
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,643
not to get caught.

805
01:02:12,145 --> 01:02:13,312
Shouldn't you have?

806
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:16,816
Father…

807
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,234
Father!

808
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,124
You need to get punished
for your wrongdoing.

809
01:02:34,292 --> 01:02:36,169
I wonder what's suitable.

810
01:02:41,048 --> 01:02:42,508
Should I send you back to the States?

811
01:02:56,981 --> 01:02:58,357
Help…

812
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:01,486
Help me.

813
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:06,908
No, Father. Please no.

814
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:08,493
Father. Father. Father.

815
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:12,079
I'll do anything
except for going to the States.

816
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:14,207
Father. Father, I'm sorry.

817
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,750
Please forgive me once.

818
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,794
Father. Just this once…

819
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:20,004
You'll do anything?

820
01:03:28,387 --> 01:03:29,388
All right.

821
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:31,182
Then

822
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:35,770
deal with Lee Seungcheon yourself.

823
01:04:16,310 --> 01:04:19,272
Big news. Our new classmate
is the daughter of UBS TV's president.

824
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:20,648
Is that so?

825
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:22,567
-UBS TV's daughter?
-She is?

826
01:04:22,650 --> 01:04:24,110
-Yes.
-She's the daughter?

827
01:04:24,694 --> 01:04:25,736
UBS?

828
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:28,990
What's her name? Juhee?

829
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:30,741
What's her surname?

830
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:34,787
I heard she got expelled
from a boarding school in the UK.

831
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:35,955
-Really?
-Gosh, really?

832
01:04:36,038 --> 01:04:38,082
Juhee, is that true?

833
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:40,167
Hey. What's with you?

834
01:04:40,251 --> 01:04:42,545
Na Juhee, long time no see.

835
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:44,380
-Okay, her name is Na Juhee.
-Oh Yeojin?

836
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:45,965
Wait. "Long time no see?"

837
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:49,218
We're classmates? This is amazing.

838
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,763
-Yeojin, are you feeling all better now?
-What do you mean?

839
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:55,558
You were really sick
back in middle school.

840
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,354
It's all in the past now.

841
01:05:01,063 --> 01:05:04,025
Juhee, did you transfer here
because of Hwang Taeyong?

842
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,319
No.

843
01:05:06,986 --> 01:05:09,405
Where's Lee Seungcheon's desk?
I heard we're classmates.

844
01:05:10,114 --> 01:05:11,324
So you already heard the rumor.

845
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:15,661
He'll probably be kicked out.
He caused a big problem.

846
01:05:15,786 --> 01:05:16,662
What?

847
01:05:18,080 --> 01:05:21,542
Our son took money from him?

848
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:23,336
That makes no sense.

849
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,964
I thought of handling this matter quietly,

850
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:30,593
but educationally speaking,
I just couldn't condone it.

851
01:05:34,597 --> 01:05:36,307
This is Mr. Hwang Taeyong's
account history.

852
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,644
From as little as 50,000 won

853
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,812
to 300,000 won at most.

854
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,733
He was extorted of money several times.

855
01:05:45,816 --> 01:05:50,446
He also took cash, so we assume
that the actual amount is much bigger.

856
01:05:52,740 --> 01:05:54,200
Seungcheon.

857
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,077
No, Mom.

858
01:05:56,160 --> 01:05:58,663
Dad, look at me.
I never extorted money from him.

859
01:05:58,746 --> 01:06:00,998
He gave me the money
in return for helping him.

860
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:05,002
Hey, Taeyong. You know
I didn't extort money from you.

861
01:06:05,753 --> 01:06:06,587
You're lying.

862
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,340
You demanded money
to sign up for online classes.

863
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,884
You threatened me
for your prep class fees.

864
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:14,637
I never did that! Hey, why are you lying?

865
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:16,263
Why are you suddenly doing this to me?

866
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:17,974
Seungcheon.

867
01:06:19,266 --> 01:06:21,227
I'm scared of him.

868
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:24,814
He speaks differently here,
but he threatened me when we were alone.

869
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:26,065
I felt like he'd kill me.

870
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,944
-Hwang Taeyong.
-May I go now?

871
01:06:30,903 --> 01:06:32,822
I can't stand being here.

872
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:34,490
Taeyong.

873
01:06:35,533 --> 01:06:37,868
Call for a school
violence committee right away.

874
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:41,122
I cannot let my Taeyong
attend school with that boy.

875
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:45,501
Taeyong, it's okay. Let's go.

876
01:06:50,047 --> 01:06:53,300
I'll make sure you get expelled.

877
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,594
Let's go, Taeyong.

878
01:07:00,975 --> 01:07:01,976
It's not true.

879
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:03,728
Dad.

880
01:07:07,398 --> 01:07:09,984
Wait, ma'am.

881
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,610
Just a moment, ma'am.

882
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,493
-Honey.
-Dad.

883
01:07:19,577 --> 01:07:22,163
Please show mercy.
Show us mercy this once.

884
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:23,748
What are you doing?

885
01:07:23,831 --> 01:07:26,667
What do you think you are doing right now?

886
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:31,797
-Sir, don't do this.
-Please.

887
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:34,925
Please, ma'am.

888
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:39,305
Our son has to go to college.
Please show mercy.

889
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:41,932
Taeyong, please do me a favor.

890
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,476
Couldn't you let it slide just once?

891
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,102
I beg you.

892
01:07:47,605 --> 01:07:48,647
Taeyong.

893
01:07:49,899 --> 01:07:53,027
I beg you. Forgive him this once.

894
01:07:53,110 --> 01:07:56,280
-Stand up.
-Please, Taeyong.

895
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:58,574
Taeyong! Please, I beg you.

896
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:01,619
-Stand up.
-Taeyong, I'm begging you!

897
01:08:01,702 --> 01:08:03,245
Please.

898
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:04,288
Jeez.

899
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,250
Seungcheon's dad must love him dearly.

900
01:08:08,334 --> 01:08:10,753
Janggun, you'll be able
to join Class Eagle now.

901
01:08:10,836 --> 01:08:11,670
I know.

902
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,132
I didn't know President Hwang would be
this quick in taking action.

903
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:19,887
Wait! Please.

904
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:22,556
Don't. I beg you.

905
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,059
Please. Ma'am.

906
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,979
Please forgive him.
Seungcheon has to go to college.

907
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:30,648
-Sir.
-Just this once for our son.

908
01:08:30,731 --> 01:08:33,400
-Sir.
-Just this once, ma'am.

909
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,286
MOM

910
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:50,376
The person you have called--

911
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,086
Why won't he answer his phone?

912
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:23,742
I guess you got scared
to hear that I'd talk to your dad.

913
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:25,911
You came so easily.

914
01:09:25,995 --> 01:09:27,663
Why did you want to see me?

915
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:32,209
Let's be honest with each other.

916
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,879
Why are you doing this to me?

917
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,965
I never threatened you for money.

918
01:09:41,635 --> 01:09:43,512
Right, I admit it.

919
01:09:43,721 --> 01:09:45,472
I made good use of you.

920
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:47,850
But I don't need you anymore.

921
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:49,935
That's the reason.

922
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,562
That can't be a reason.

923
01:09:52,062 --> 01:09:53,898
I'm about to get expelled because of you.

924
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,274
I'll have you drop out.

925
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,359
It's better than being expelled.

926
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,236
How could you do this to me?

927
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:02,156
I thought we were friends.

928
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:06,452
Friends? You and I are friends?

929
01:10:08,162 --> 01:10:10,748
Did you forget? You said yourself
that we were real friends.

930
01:10:10,831 --> 01:10:12,791
Hey, what do you take me for?

931
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:15,961
You can't be friends with me,
Hwang Taeyong.

932
01:10:16,170 --> 01:10:18,464
You live in a semi-basement
and wear a second-hand uniform

933
01:10:18,547 --> 01:10:19,798
and cheap sneakers!

934
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:21,634
So how can you be my friend?

935
01:10:22,301 --> 01:10:23,135
What?

936
01:10:25,054 --> 01:10:27,640
This is why
I shouldn't be good to the poor.

937
01:10:28,015 --> 01:10:30,601
They don't know their place
and cling to me like you!

938
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:37,483
All right.

939
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:39,985
This is good enough.

940
01:10:41,028 --> 01:10:43,489
I'm going to play this
during the committee hearing.

941
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,825
What are you doing?

942
01:10:48,118 --> 01:10:50,287
You said it yourself that you lied.

943
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:51,288
VOICE RECORDING

944
01:10:52,748 --> 01:10:54,667
Fine, go ahead.

945
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,753
I'm Hwang Taeyong of Doshin Group.

946
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:59,880
I may be suspended at most,

947
01:11:00,297 --> 01:11:01,590
but it'll be different for you.

948
01:11:01,799 --> 01:11:03,592
My father won't leave you be.

949
01:11:03,759 --> 01:11:05,302
Your family will be done for!

950
01:11:05,386 --> 01:11:07,012
Yes, perhaps.

951
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:08,973
But what if that isn't the end?

952
01:11:10,099 --> 01:11:12,768
I'm going to spread this
to the media, online, everywhere.

953
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:15,562
So that the whole country finds out

954
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:18,732
the rotten nature of you and your family!

955
01:11:21,068 --> 01:11:23,237
I'll pay you. You like money.

956
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,782
You like money.

957
01:11:27,366 --> 01:11:30,202
I'll pay you. Here, take this.

958
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:31,954
Take the money now!

959
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:51,223
Give me your phone.
Delete the recording, you bastard!

960
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,975
No, I'll take this to the end.

961
01:11:53,058 --> 01:11:54,393
I won't leave you be either!

962
01:11:54,476 --> 01:11:55,561
Who do you think you are?

963
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:58,397
How dare you try me, bastard?

964
01:12:03,360 --> 01:12:06,488
Hey, Hwang Taeyong!

965
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:07,489
Seungcheon!

966
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:09,033
Hwang Taeyong!

967
01:12:10,534 --> 01:12:11,827
-Taeyong.
-Seungcheon.

968
01:12:12,369 --> 01:12:14,288
-Seungcheon, hold on.
-Help me.

969
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:17,249
-Seungcheon.
-Don't let go, help.

970
01:12:18,208 --> 01:12:19,168
Taeyong.

971
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,588
Seungcheon, hold my hands tightly.

972
01:12:23,255 --> 01:12:24,340
Help!

973
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:25,674
Taeyong!

974
01:12:30,554 --> 01:12:32,598
Taeyong, help me.

975
01:12:32,681 --> 01:12:34,183
-Taeyong!
-No, hold on!

976
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:35,309
Taeyong.

977
01:12:37,269 --> 01:12:39,313
Hwang Taeyong, no!

978
01:12:43,525 --> 01:12:44,401
Seungcheon!

979
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:53,369
Seungcheon!

980
01:12:59,750 --> 01:13:00,959
Seungcheon! Seungcheon!

981
01:13:10,761 --> 01:13:12,638
Seungcheon!

982
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:26,860
EMERGENCY NUMBER

983
01:13:28,487 --> 01:13:30,906
Emergency services. How may I help you?

984
01:13:36,286 --> 01:13:37,287
Hello?

985
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:39,498
Hello?

986
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,522
Am I really

987
01:14:04,565 --> 01:14:05,899
going to die?

988
01:14:07,734 --> 01:14:08,819
Jinseok.

989
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:14,199
Is this how you felt when you died?

990
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:16,743
Well, all right.

991
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,038
It might be good to die here.

992
01:14:20,914 --> 01:14:22,875
Rather than struggling
as a dirt spoon all my life,

993
01:14:23,417 --> 01:14:24,918
this might be better.

994
01:14:26,336 --> 01:14:27,588
Jinseok.

995
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:30,257
So are you resting in peace?

996
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:56,533
Look. This golden spoon can make you rich.

997
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,677
Jinseok.

998
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:18,263
I won't die like you.

999
01:15:20,057 --> 01:15:21,433
I won't submit to my fate.

1000
01:15:22,809 --> 01:15:23,852
At any cost,

1001
01:15:24,978 --> 01:15:26,021
I will make sure

1002
01:15:27,606 --> 01:15:28,732
to survive.

1003
01:16:25,831 --> 01:16:28,250
-Where's Taeyong?
-He isn't home yet.

1004
01:16:30,794 --> 01:16:32,337
Did you handle the matter at his school?

1005
01:16:35,591 --> 01:16:36,800
President Hwang!

1006
01:16:37,801 --> 01:16:38,885
President Hwang.

1007
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:41,013
President Hwang.

1008
01:16:47,185 --> 01:16:48,186
You are…

1009
01:16:48,270 --> 01:16:51,148
President Hwang, I'm here
to ask you for a favor.

1010
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:52,357
A favor?

1011
01:16:55,027 --> 01:16:55,902
Could I have a meal?

1012
01:17:00,282 --> 01:17:02,534
-A meal?
-I know you don't like me.

1013
01:17:02,659 --> 01:17:04,036
This will be my last request.

1014
01:17:05,495 --> 01:17:06,455
Could I have

1015
01:17:07,581 --> 01:17:08,707
just one meal?

1016
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:19,760
SPECIAL THANKS TO SHIN JOO HYUP
FOR HIS GUEST APPEARANCE

1017
01:17:49,373 --> 01:17:53,460
Everything around you will change
except for you.

1018
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:56,004
I'm Na Juhee, Hwang Taeyong's fiancee.

1019
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:58,298
This is awesome.

1020
01:17:58,382 --> 01:18:00,258
-Mom.
-Yes, it's me.

1021
01:18:00,967 --> 01:18:02,594
Seungcheon!

1022
01:18:02,678 --> 01:18:05,055
Does Hwang Taeyong
have feelings for Juhee?

1023
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:07,391
Mr. Hwang Taeyong sent these.

1024
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,643
Aren't you curious
about how I'll abuse my power?

1025
01:18:09,726 --> 01:18:13,522
Lee Seungcheon has always been our toy.

1026
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,316
Kill him. Let's just kill him off.
