1
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:42,459
Where are you taking me?

2
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:44,294
Let me talk to my attorney!

3
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,630
Will you be quiet?

4
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:53,386
You people aren't detectives, are you?

5
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,431
Stop the car right now. Stop the car!

6
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,266
-Shut him up.
-Stop--

7
00:01:10,487 --> 00:01:12,572
You startled me, Lee Seungcheon.

8
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:13,948
Sorry.

9
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:15,867
Can I come in for a moment?

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:16,993
Yeah.

11
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:29,130
Where was the switch?

12
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:37,931
You haven't had dinner, have you?
Do you want some noodles?

13
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,893
-Juhee.
-What is it?

14
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:49,025
Are you okay?

15
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,487
What is that?

16
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,281
This?

17
00:01:59,786 --> 00:02:02,330
I was worried to think
that you were alone in this mansion.

18
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:05,291
I bought it with my paycheck.

19
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,628
Carry it with you.

20
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,798
Now get up.

21
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,347
-Thanks.
-Then add two eggs to the noodles.

22
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,599
-But it's cup noodles.
-Exactly.

23
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,810
Forget it.

24
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:26,980
-Soft-boil them, please.
-I like them hard-boiled.

25
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,599
EPISODE 8

26
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:09,647
Where am I?

27
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,108
Get him up.

28
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:15,111
Let go of me. Get off!

29
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:17,864
Don't you know who I am?

30
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,908
I'm Hwang Taeyong of Dosin Group!

31
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,035
Do you even know what will happen
if you mess with me!

32
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,330
Please spare me. I didn't kill him.

33
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,040
I'll tell you the truth!

34
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,583
Talk it out with me!

35
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,502
I'll do everything you want.
Please spare me.

36
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,195
Did you have a rough ride?

37
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,829
Welcome to Amikus.

38
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,925
The one you've all been waiting for.

39
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,469
The star rookie of Amikus this year.

40
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:23,263
This is Hwang Taeyong.

41
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:32,522
-Hwang Taeyong!
-Hwang Taeyong!

42
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:36,109
-Hwang Taeyong!
-Hwang Taeyong!

43
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:39,904
Amikus?

44
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,495
You grew up so much, babe.

45
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,580
Do you remember me?

46
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:50,665
Uh…

47
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:52,625
Yes.

48
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:54,961
Hey, Taeyong.

49
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,880
Don't miss our gatherings if you don't
want to get dragged out here again.

50
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,468
Juntae, I get that this is
a surprise party for Taeyong,

51
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,304
but the arrest fakeout was a bit too much.

52
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,639
It was fun, no?

53
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,769
He'll kindly let it slide
since it was just for fun. Right, Taeyong?

54
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,941
I don't mind, but my father will.

55
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,612
But I'll keep it from him, Uncle.

56
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,614
For fun.

57
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,034
Because it was for fun.

58
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:30,580
-Taeyong.
-Taeyong.

59
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:34,834
-Taeyong!
-You've finally joined us.

60
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,211
-Welcome to Amikus!
-Amikus!

61
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,048
-Look, Taeyong.
-Look.

62
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,633
We waited so long for you to join Amikus.

63
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,260
I almost thought you wouldn't.

64
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,054
-Hey.
-Let's go, Taeyong.

65
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,683
Come along.

66
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:53,770
I'll introduce you to the others.
Follow me.

67
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:56,064
Let's hurry and go. Get up.

68
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,941
-Come on.
-Man, you're heavy.

69
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:00,943
You'll be surprised to meet the others.

70
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:02,779
-Come.
-Ms. Oh, let's go.

71
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,035
Hwang Taeyong
is totally different from before.

72
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:14,082
I know. What if Juntae gets pushed out
by his nephew?

73
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,124
No way.

74
00:06:25,468 --> 00:06:28,054
That girl's father
is a presidential candidate.

75
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:31,307
That guy is from the famous
Myeongseong Hotel family.

76
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,267
Politicians, plutocrats, and celebrities.

77
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,937
Every child of an upper-class family
is a member here.

78
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,189
Is this what rich people do for fun?

79
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:39,899
They don't just have fun.

80
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,777
They protect cultural assets
and do volunteer work as hobbies.

81
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,488
Their specialties are land speculation
and stock price manipulation.

82
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,242
They're the so-called string-pullers.

83
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,411
Guess what's more surprising.

84
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:54,872
All of them are envious

85
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,332
of you, Lee Seungcheon.

86
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,962
Look around you.
They're waiting for you to talk to them.

87
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:05,508
Enjoy the moment a bit.
You're Hwang Taeyong.

88
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:20,064
Hey, Taeyong's leaving.

89
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,150
Taeyong, are you leaving already?

90
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,526
-Why…
-Hey, you can't go.

91
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,076
Where are you going in such a rush?

92
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:34,620
The party has just begun.

93
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,040
I need to be somewhere.

94
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,917
Who are you meeting at this hour?

95
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,462
Juhee?

96
00:07:45,756 --> 00:07:47,425
Do you still have a crush on her?

97
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:51,554
Fine. If you want to leave, go ahead.

98
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,350
But at least have a drink with me
before you do.

99
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,459
Did he actually leave?

100
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,065
Tell me.

101
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,068
You didn't come home
drunk that night, did you?

102
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,236
You met with President Na.

103
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,741
I don't know.

104
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,207
Yes, you do.

105
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:05,002
That day, you met and killed President Na.

106
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,338
You killed him,

107
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,258
and your father covered it up.

108
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:13,344
-No. I didn't kill him.
-Am I right?

109
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,558
Hey, Hwang Taeyong.
Pull yourself together.

110
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,809
Hwang Taeyong.

111
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,394
Hwang Taeyong…

112
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:24,897
I'm not Hwang Taeyong.

113
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,277
I'm Lee Seungcheon.

114
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,529
Lee Seungcheon…

115
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:34,448
Lee Seungcheon?

116
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,202
What is he saying?

117
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:43,207
Juntae? What's wrong with Taeyong?

118
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,044
-He's totally drunk.
-Yes, so I'm going to take him home.

119
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,629
Janggun, will you help me out?

120
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:49,630
Sure.

121
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:51,841
Hwang Taeyong, wake up.

122
00:09:52,592 --> 00:09:54,719
Goodness, why did you drink so much?

123
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,346
You're heavy. Hey, wake up.

124
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,267
Hey, step with your left.
I said the left, man.

125
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,019
You drank too much.

126
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:09,567
He killed President Na?

127
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,904
Is that why Hwang Taeyong wanted to die?

128
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,473
-Mom?
-Taeyong.

129
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,976
Goodness, my head.

130
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,066
Why am I here?

131
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,361
You came here drunk last night.

132
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,865
-Can you have breakfast?
-He doesn't deserve to be fed.

133
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:02,495
Mom, you can't be with him.
He may have killed someone.

134
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,623
What is he saying?

135
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:07,416
Hey, you shameless punk.

136
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,960
You abandoned your parents to become rich.

137
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,088
How dare you slander me?

138
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,048
What…

139
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,391
Yes, what I did was wrong.
But Hwang Taeyong is too dangerous.

140
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,810
Juhee, he may have killed President Na.

141
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,561
You don't know what he might do to you!

142
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,443
Taeyong, don't be ridiculous.

143
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,862
-Hey!
-It's true.

144
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,156
Why don't you believe it?

145
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,533
No.

146
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:43,035
No!

147
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,830
No! No, Juhee.

148
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,873
Juhee!

149
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,960
Oh, my goodness. Juhee.

150
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,632
Young master, are you okay?

151
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,013
What did you dream about?
What made you scream like that?

152
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:06,434
Hwang Taeyong killed someone...

153
00:12:08,185 --> 00:12:09,103
in my dream.

154
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:14,775
I see you're not sober yet.
You drank too much.

155
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:17,069
Munki, what am I like?

156
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,868
You're a nasty rich young man.

157
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:28,080
You never listen to others
and stubbornly do what you want.

158
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,711
But you're a good man.

159
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,464
Like your late mother.

160
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:40,217
Then what if I really killed someone?

161
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,511
Don't be so fussy over a dream.

162
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:46,307
You can never kill anyone. You pass out
in panic just by seeing blood.

163
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,143
Hurry out for breakfast.

164
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,611
That day, you met and killed President Na.

165
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,947
Did Hwang Taeyong really kill him?

166
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,370
He drugged Taeyong?

167
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,831
Amikus hazing rituals can get out of hand.

168
00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:13,459
But he was handcuffed,
kidnapped, and even drugged.

169
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:14,460
That's a bit much.

170
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,921
I thought you should know.

171
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:24,094
I know why you're keeping
Seo Juntae close by.

172
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,598
He's Taeyong's pacemaker, right?

173
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,350
But I think you chose the wrong person.

174
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:45,908
You're Oh Yeojin, did you say?

175
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,869
Now get to the point.

176
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:51,705
About you, not Juntae.

177
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,424
I want to be engaged to Taeyong.

178
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,011
You do?

179
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,515
To my son? Why?

180
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:10,516
I may seem gutsy to you

181
00:14:10,599 --> 00:14:13,227
because my father's company
isn't even in the top 100.

182
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,771
But I can promise you one thing.

183
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,648
I will...

184
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:20,818
protect Taeyong.

185
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:27,741
Hey, Lee Seungcheon.

186
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,456
What do you think you're doing?

187
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:36,166
Are you pissed? Then hit me too.

188
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,422
Stop it, Hwang Taeyong!

189
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,341
Why aren't you doing anything? Hit me too.

190
00:14:44,425 --> 00:14:46,093
Try to kill me

191
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,429
like you did to Mr. Oh, you punk!

192
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:57,646
That was because I lost my cool
since he did something bad to my mom.

193
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,191
Hwang Taeyong,
why are you doing this to me?

194
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,321
Can a guy like him actually kill someone?

195
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:12,286
I'm sorry. I did it
to check something about you.

196
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,997
Check what? What did you want to check?

197
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:18,792
I wanted to check if you could
actually kill someone if you're mad.

198
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,669
You're crazy.

199
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:24,381
All right, I'll show you
that I'm capable of--

200
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,014
Follow me.

201
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,478
Hwang Taeyong, you're dead meat.

202
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,896
I'll teach you a lesson!

203
00:15:44,401 --> 00:15:47,279
I'll let it slide because I'm busy today.
Brace yourself for later.

204
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:49,740
Hey.

205
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,869
President Na. Did you really…

206
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,793
Never mind.

207
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:02,795
What on earth?

208
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:11,720
Sir.

209
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:12,638
Sir!

210
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,894
You can't drink here.
This is a convenience store.

211
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:23,273
Why can't I? I can drink wherever I want.

212
00:16:23,357 --> 00:16:25,651
Sir, just a moment.

213
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,157
-Sir, then use this paper cup.
-Mm.

214
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,118
Thanks.

215
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,829
You're a good person, Taeyong.

216
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:40,249
You can never kill anyone. You pass out
in panic just by seeing blood.

217
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,089
Goodness, sir. Pull yourself together.

218
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,804
Just how much did you drink?

219
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:57,808
-Taeyong!
-No, hold on!

220
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,060
He didn't let go of my hand at that time.

221
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,105
He must've wanted to kill me,

222
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:05,733
and it could've been
the best chance to do so.

223
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,777
But he didn't let go of my hand
until the end.

224
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:11,071
-Drink some.
-No, it's okay.

225
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,197
Come on.

226
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:13,741
No matter how much I think about it,

227
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:16,869
Hwang Taeyong wouldn't kill anyone.

228
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,997
Ah. Mm.

229
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,255
You're home, honey.

230
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,300
Honey?

231
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,260
Honey.

232
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:37,806
Honey.

233
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,193
You're home early.

234
00:17:51,695 --> 00:17:53,280
Honey, no!

235
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:54,740
Honey!

236
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,245
What's wrong with you?
Are you trying to kill my Juntae?

237
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:03,916
Move aside. You don't know
what your brother did to Taeyong.

238
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,628
How dare you put my son in cuffs
and treat him like a murderer?

239
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:10,339
Hyeondo, that was just for fun.

240
00:18:11,381 --> 00:18:12,508
For fun?

241
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,512
I'm sorry, Hyeondo.

242
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,987
Are you okay, Juntae?

243
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,706
My Juntae did everything
you told him to do.

244
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:48,502
He even offered President Na's company
to you, so what is your problem?

245
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,671
Don't tell me he did that for me.

246
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,717
His goal is to trample on Taeyong
to become the heir himself.

247
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,846
Or is it your goal?

248
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,267
You gave him hope.

249
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:08,605
-Because Taeyong wasn't enough for you.
-Plan B is needed at all times.

250
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:14,319
But I don't need a hound
that attacks his master.

251
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,364
A hound?

252
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,951
How could you say that?

253
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,460
You're behaving very strangely.
You know that?

254
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:34,590
"My Juntae, my Juntae." Others might think
you're his mom or something.

255
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,592
Don't forget.

256
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:41,847
Your son is Hwang Taeyong, not Juntae.

257
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:46,310
My son, Hwang Taeyong.

258
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:50,022
Do you get it?

259
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:15,088
Ms. Na Juhee, you're our VIP guest.

260
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,216
Our royal suite is available for you.

261
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:18,967
How much is that?

262
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,428
It's 4.58 million won
including tax and service charge, ma'am.

263
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,724
What about a deluxe room?

264
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,018
It's 680,000 won including tax
and service charge.

265
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,269
It's 680,000…

266
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:30,312
Will you take that?

267
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,397
No, it's all right.

268
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,107
My card.

269
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,752
Do you have a cheaper room?

270
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:48,557
It's 500 million won. This is
Dad's slush fund, so do not get tracked.

271
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,434
This ends our settlement.

272
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,438
It's over between you and us.

273
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,826
TAEYONG
JUHEE, WHY CAN'T I REACH YOU?

274
00:22:10,662 --> 00:22:13,165
Juhee, why can't I reach you?

275
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,667
Is everything all right?
Call me if you read this text.

276
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,420
She's not answering.

277
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:24,176
-It's a welcome gift.
-What is this?

278
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,470
-The number is 0727680.
-"The number is 0727680."

279
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,352
0727680

280
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:34,269
KORA E&G

281
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,867
Moon Ikjum was a loyal politician
in the late Goryeo Dynasty,

282
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:52,412
and his 18th descendant, Moon Kyungho,
made this village in the mid-19th century.

283
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,707
Currently, it has nine traditional houses
from the late Joseon times

284
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,711
one ritual preparation building,
one temple, and one library.

285
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,130
And the building in front of you

286
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:05,675
was a school for children as well as
a place for academic discussion.

287
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,178
It still boasts of its beautiful garden.

288
00:23:08,261 --> 00:23:11,056
-Amikus funded its restoration.
-You can see the architectural features…

289
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:14,434
-So this is a part of their hobbies.
-…of the late Joseon and the noble family.

290
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:17,479
And if you look at the tall gate
behind you,

291
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:20,399
it symbolized wealth and power
at the time.

292
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,692
Why don't we take a look inside, then?

293
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:32,452
Because you came,
Mr. Smile wouldn't join us.

294
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,038
-Mr. Smile?
-Have you forgotten?

295
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,207
Mr. Smile is Juntae's nickname.

296
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:40,752
Right.

297
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,464
Taeyong, you've gotten a lot bolder.

298
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,800
You used to be so intimidated
around Juntae.

299
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:49,803
He always put the blame on you
for whatever he did wrong.

300
00:23:50,178 --> 00:23:52,722
Remember? You got scolded
in his place for breaking the window.

301
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,851
At that time,

302
00:23:57,519 --> 00:23:58,353
I was too young.

303
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:00,522
By the way, Nana.

304
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,317
You're his friend.
Is it okay to speak ill about him to me?

305
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,238
I just wanted us to be closer, that's all.

306
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,284
Right. Did you like the welcome gift?

307
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,494
It will hit the ceiling tomorrow again.

It's so easy to make money.

310
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,362
You didn't get rehab treatment
after the fall, did you?

311
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,324
No.

312
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:55,535
You cannot draw in this state.

313
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,079
What?

314
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:09,883
-I'm back.
-Good work.

315
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,551
Hey, son.

316
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:16,056
Dad? What are you doing here?

317
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,849
Come have a seat here.

318
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,396
I got a call from your homeroom teacher
from last year.

319
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,732
I heard you gave up on college.

320
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,571
Yes, I'll become a webtoon artist
like you instead of going to college.

321
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:33,490
What?

322
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:36,034
I have everything planned out.

323
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,328
The cost for my studies
and the student loan…

324
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:41,540
When I graduate, my debt might be
as much as 50 million won.

325
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:44,501
Won't it be much better
to work in the daytime, draw at night,

326
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:47,879
and debut as a webtoon artist

327
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:49,589
before I join the military?

328
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:53,218
How can you say that
after seeing how my life has been?

329
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,095
What's wrong with your life?

330
00:25:58,723 --> 00:25:59,766
Dad.

331
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:03,144
I realized it at Juhee's dad's funeral.

332
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,063
It's good to have money and go to college.

333
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:07,983
But nothing matters without you and Mom.

334
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,486
To me, you guys come first.

335
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,281
Seungcheon, I get it.

336
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,786
Thank you for your kind words,
but a person must have money.

337
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,081
I know it from experience.

338
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,625
You must go to college too.

339
00:26:28,336 --> 00:26:29,546
And you must have money.

340
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:40,348
By the way, it's so unfortunate
that Juhee lost her father.

341
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,186
You've never met him, have you?

342
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,773
No, never.

343
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,861
But he must have been a good man.

344
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:55,113
Are you crying?

345
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:07,709
Why am I crying?

346
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:15,550
It's okay.

347
00:27:19,471 --> 00:27:21,598
-Have you talked to Taeyong?
-What?

348
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:25,560
It's so unexpected
that he killed President Na.

349
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:27,771
How did you--

350
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,689
I heard what Juntae said to you.

351
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:32,984
Beware of him. He's after you.

352
00:27:33,985 --> 00:27:34,819
I know.

353
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:39,324
But I don't think
Taeyong would kill someone.

354
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,035
That way, you can be at ease.

355
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,663
Whatever the truth is,
one thing's for sure.

356
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,331
You can't be with Na Juhee.

357
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:49,459
Even if Hwang Taeyong didn't kill him,

358
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,044
it's over between you and her.

359
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:55,006
If Na Juhee finds out about this,
she won't just take it.

360
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:57,550
I won't let Juhee find out about it
no matter what.

361
00:27:58,593 --> 00:27:59,886
I won't let it get to her.

362
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:00,804
Oh Yeojin.

363
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:04,140
You keep your mouth shut too.

364
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,067
Isn't that obvious?

365
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,612
I wouldn't get anything
out of causing you harm.

366
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,916
I told you not to do anything stupid.

367
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:32,627
Why would you drug him?

368
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:33,753
Like you said,

369
00:28:36,256 --> 00:28:37,841
he's a little strange.

370
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,886
He would have told me everything
back in the day.

371
00:28:43,763 --> 00:28:44,889
But he didn't say anything.

372
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,101
And what was that?

373
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,021
He said he was Lee Seungcheon.

374
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,606
Lee Seungcheon?

375
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,442
I wonder
why he said such nonsense.

376
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,444
Was he envious of him?

377
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:01,030
Why would he be? He's just a boy
from a dirt poor family.

378
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,324
Juntae.

379
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:09,164
Anyway, be careful.

380
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,498
I know.

381
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:16,296
I'll stay low.

382
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,681
What have you done?

383
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,308
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

384
00:29:28,391 --> 00:29:29,851
What should we do about this?

385
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,396
Ms. Gong?

386
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,150
-What's going on?
-Ma'am.

387
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,324
She was told to dispose of
the young master's jacket,

388
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:45,909
but she tried to resell it.

389
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,416
AGE99 JACKET
3,400,000 WON

390
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,711
Where is this jacket?

391
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,763
LIZZY REAL ESTATE OFFICE

00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,856
It's darn expensive.

394
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:23,029
TAEYONG

395
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:28,076
TAEYONG

396
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,455
Hi, Taeyong.

397
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,218
Are you doing okay?

398
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:47,637
Of course not.

399
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:50,723
I took time off from college,
and I'm staying at a hotel now.

400
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,684
You already know, don't you?

401
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,607
Sorry I didn't answer your calls.

402
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,402
I guess I still resented your family.

403
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,866
You called me because
you were worried for me, didn't you?

404
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:10,827
No, because I missed you.

405
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:14,372
I wondered if you weren't
skipping any meals,

406
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,916
what you were thinking all day
in the hotel room,

407
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,794
and if you weren't crying alone somewhere.

408
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,255
Yes, I was worried,

409
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,175
but I missed you more.

410
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:30,930
Taeyong, I told you before.
I have feelings for Lee Seungcheon.

411
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,725
Juhee, stop liking him.

412
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,935
He's not the Lee Seungcheon
you knew and liked.

413
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,312
He's not the same guy.

414
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,313
Taeyong.

415
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,815
You said you liked him
since the first time you saw him.

416
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:44,527
Is he the same
as when you first saw him? No.

417
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:48,489
What are you trying to say?
Seungcheon is just Seungcheon.

418
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,326
Even if he has changed,
it has nothing to do with you.

419
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:52,827
You fool, Lee Seungcheon is…

420
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,043
The real Lee Seungcheon is…

421
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:08,009
Taeyong, I don't know
why you're being like this,

422
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,346
but you're making me feel uncomfortable.

423
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,097
I'll be going.

424
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:36,996
Juhee.

425
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:39,999
Juhee, I'm sorry.

426
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:43,378
That wasn't why I wanted to meet you.

427
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,088
Taeyong.

428
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,798
I won't make you feel uncomfortable.

429
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,841
I won't tell you anything unpleasant.

430
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:51,427
So answer my calls.

431
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,805
We're friends after all.

432
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:04,023
I get it, so will you
let go of my arm now?

433
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,704
I'll get going, then.

434
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,502
Juhee.

435
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,382
Let me know if anything happens.

436
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,385
If you call me,
I'll run over to wherever you are.

437
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:34,512
Okay?

438
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:37,348
Okay.

439
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,076
Did something happen to Taeyong?

440
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:03,583
But did I ever tell him
that I liked Seungcheon

441
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,627
from the moment I saw him?

442
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,517
Hello? Who is this?

443
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:25,897
Ms. Kim?

444
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:32,945
You said you wanted to know more
about your dad's death, right?

445
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,991
Someone visited him that day.

446
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,910
Who?

447
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,372
I heard you got money. Bring me money.

448
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:45,291
Then I'll tell you.

449
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,630
Hello? Ms. Kim.

450
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,150
So are you the head of DS TV now?

451
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,029
I wouldn't dare covet that position.

452
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,534
Then again, I bet it wouldn't be enough
to satisfy you.

453
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:22,203
Look who it is.

454
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,123
The son is here too.

455
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,557
This is CEO Alex Boo
of Golden Money Investment.

456
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,892
The takeover was only possible
thanks to his help.

457
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,528
And President Hwang has signed
the contract for Dosin's commercials

458
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,489
in line with the launching of DS TV.

459
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,036
Is the draft ready?

460
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,423
Thank you.

461
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,508
There's a boy who is a bit special.

462
00:36:19,051 --> 00:36:21,304
Enjoy your food,
and don't leave any leftovers.

463
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:24,432
-Yes! Thank you for the food.
-Yes! Thank you for the food.

464
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:32,565
As always, Changwoo
takes his snacks in secret,

465
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:35,484
to give to his little sister, Yooyoung.

-Although it's a small birthday party,

467

Who are they? Hold on.

470
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,668
What are those?

471
00:36:52,752 --> 00:36:54,086
It's candy!

472
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,214
An unexpected gift has arrived.

473
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,429
Ready, go.

476
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:12,230
I recommend Lee Seungcheon as the needy!

479
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:25,368
Then how much
should we bring for Seungcheon?

480
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,703
-How much?
-I'd say, 2,000 won.

481
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:29,538
All right, 2,000 won. Yes, Seoyoung?

482
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,832
-Let's just make it 1,000 won.
-Okay, 1,000 won.

483
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,626
How much?

484
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:35,586
-One won.
-What?

485
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,964
-That's silly.
-1,500 won.

486
00:37:38,047 --> 00:37:40,091
-I'd say 3,500 won.
-I see.

487
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,927
-It's too much. Let's make it 500 won.
-What, 500 won?

488
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,099
Then let's… Seungcheon?

489
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:59,652
The magical power of love that blooms
when we are together.

490
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:02,613
We will share with you.
We will be together with you.

491
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:04,740
Your friend forever, Dosin.

492
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,658
DOSIN GROUP

493
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:17,128
I think it's quite nice for a draft.
I also like its tone.

494
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:19,171
It came out very sophisticated.

495
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,798
Is this what you call sophisticated?

496
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:27,471
"Dosin Group together with the poor."

497
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:29,223
It's not bad.

498
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:31,058
But I wonder how the children felt

499
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,644
picking up candy from the ground
as if they were given alms.

500
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:36,188
I doubt they felt happy.

501
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:39,900
Sharing requires courtesy.

502
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,529
The way I see it, that commercial
is about violence, not sharing.

503
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:47,283
The violent view
against the poor from the rich.

504
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:55,166
I don't think this is worth airing.

505
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,836
Thoughtless sympathy and charity
shouldn't be the face of Dosin.

506
00:39:07,136 --> 00:39:08,429
He has a point.

507
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:12,850
It won't do for you to miss an issue
that a college freshman could identify.

508
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:15,770
Don't you agree?

509
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:24,362
I guess the son is better
than the brother-in-law?

510
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,619
Your son is something else.

511
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:33,829
He'll become a remarkable businessman.

512
00:39:34,622 --> 00:39:36,665
He's got a strong sense of empathy.

513
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:40,461
Do you really think so?

514
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,758
I think that is his problem.

515
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:00,314
Mm?

516
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:06,612
Mmm. Your hotel's mango bingsu
is to die for.

517
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,864
Yeojin.

518
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:12,201
You're the prettiest girl
in Amikus this year. You know that?

519
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,912
Gosh, you are so pretty.

520
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:16,997
Eat up.

521
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:21,001
Right, you did sell
all your shares from Kora, right?

522
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,547
Of course. I got a new car
thanks to you, my seniors.

523
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:28,134
Goodness, you have
such a sweet way of saying things.

524
00:40:28,217 --> 00:40:30,761
This is why everyone
is dying to join Amikus.

525
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:34,223
That was chump change,
but we'll soon get a chance to make more.

526
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:37,351
Eat up.

527
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:46,944
Five hundred million won?

528
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,450
There's 500 million won in this suitcase?

529
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,495
But how did that butler find out about it?

530
00:40:56,579 --> 00:41:00,249
Ms. Kim was close to my brother's butler.
I think that's how she heard about it.

531
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:03,961
She said someone visited my dad
on the day he died.

532
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,671
It didn't sound like a lie.

533
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,718
All right, let's say
she tells you about it.

534
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:14,638
But, Juhee, will you be okay?

535
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,307
What do you mean?

536
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,935
This money is all you have.

537
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,440
Will you be okay without it?

538
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:35,743
You understand the poor so well
for a young master from a rich family.

539
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,454
It's as if you've experienced it yourself.

540
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,461
One of my friends is very poor.

541
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:47,755
He told me

542
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:51,592
that being poor
doesn't mean he's without pride.

543
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,677
That's wrong.

544
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:55,846
He's got nothing but pride
because he's poor.

545
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,432
But that attitude
can make your life bitter.

546
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,060
I recently met a guy.

547
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:05,022
He didn't have a penny to his name,
but he was shameless and laid back.

548
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,983
I've got to get back
my 50,000 won from him.

549
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,320
Let me see. His name was…

550
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:23,666
LEE SEUNGCHEON

551
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:24,959
It was Lee Seungcheon.

552
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:33,217
It seems they will take measures.

553
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:39,723
OH YEOJIN

554
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:41,934
What is it?

555
00:42:42,017 --> 00:42:45,980
Lee Seungcheon, Na Juhee
is on her way to meet her former butler.

556
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,648
Her butler?

557
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:49,275
Listen to me.

558
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,695
It seems the butler
saw Hwang Taeyong that day.

559
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,655
There's no time!

560
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:57,616
Hurry and stop Na Juhee
from meeting the butler!

561
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,756
Juhee, are you sure you won't regret it?

562
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,093
I'll probably regret it.

563
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,803
But...

564
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:20,472
I'll still regret it even if I don't go.

565
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:25,394
I'll meet her first.

566
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:29,773
If she's lying,
I won't give this money to her.

567
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,778
I need to live on, you see.

568
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,078
Don't worry. I'll be with you.

569
00:43:45,956 --> 00:43:46,790
Let's go.

570
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,849
Young master, what is this about?

571
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,774
Munki, stop the car.

572
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:16,839
MS. KIM

573
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:19,925
Hello, Ms. Kim.

574
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,553
I'm here. Where are you?

575
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,601
Look who's here.

576
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,024
Where are you right now?

577
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,074
I see you.

578
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,201
I can't believe whom you came with.

579
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:49,621
Pardon?

580
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:54,251
Ms. Kim, did you see me?

581
00:45:56,754 --> 00:45:58,589
Yes, I just did.

582
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,680
Juhee, you really are stupid.

583
00:46:07,306 --> 00:46:10,350
The last person your father met--

584
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,037
What happened?

585
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:36,794
-Ms. Kim.
-Call 119.

586
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,754
-I think we have to call an ambulance.
-Call 119.

587
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:41,465
Oh, my.

588
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,425
-Is she dead?
-I think she's dead.

589
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,950
This is not good.

590
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:11,119
YOUNGSHIN

591
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:13,413
Yeah, Youngshin?

592
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,917
DNA TEST RESULT

593
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:20,754
Juntae, I found something amusing.

594
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,385
DNA SAMPLE: NA SANGGUK
DNA SAMPLE: FROM CLOTHES

595
00:47:28,470 --> 00:47:30,472
THE TWO SAMPLES ARE FROM THE SAME PERSON

596
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,694
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICE
AMBULANCE

597
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:47,364
How could this happen?

598
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,081
Hwang Taeyong?

599
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,001
Hwang…

600
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:04,423
Excuse me.

601
00:48:05,757 --> 00:48:07,009
Are you okay?

602
00:48:07,759 --> 00:48:09,011
Seungcheon!

603
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:12,306
Seungcheon! Seungcheon!

604
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,767
What's wrong, Seungcheon?

605
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:18,228
Can you breathe? Seungcheon.

606
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:21,189
Are you okay?

607
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,900
Breathe.

608
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,860
Juhee.

609
00:48:27,446 --> 00:48:28,906
This is not a coincidence.

610
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,908
It could never be.

611
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:33,452
Then…

612
00:48:41,668 --> 00:48:44,254
You should have kept your promise.

613
00:48:54,473 --> 00:48:57,017
Talk to me later
if it's about the commercial.

614
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:00,646
It's about President Na.

615
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,485
Or should I start with his former butler?

616
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:25,671
Munki, I need to meet my father
right away.

617
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:27,798
He's definitely related
to what just happened.

618
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,511
Then you shouldn't meet him.

619
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,888
What are you talking about?

620
00:49:36,348 --> 00:49:38,934
Do you perhaps know something?

621
00:49:39,518 --> 00:49:43,647
No, but if it's related to the president,
you must wait until he summons you.

622
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:45,107
You shouldn't cross the line.

623
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,818
Thanks for the advice,
but I can't do that.

624
00:49:52,906 --> 00:49:54,366
Seungcheon, are you feeling better?

625
00:49:56,994 --> 00:49:58,412
It was so terrifying

626
00:49:59,871 --> 00:50:01,498
that I lost my mind for a moment.

627
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:03,208
I'm sorry.

628
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,341
I just don't get what's going on.

629
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,144
Seungcheon.

630
00:50:22,769 --> 00:50:24,563
Where's my suitcase?

631
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:27,691
Your suitcase?

632
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:29,192
The suitcase.

633
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:53,133
Juhee.

634
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:58,638
DNA TEST RESULT
NATIONAL FORENSIC SERVICE

635
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:03,435
President Na's blood
was found on Taeyong's jacket.

636
00:51:05,187 --> 00:51:07,939
How did you miss this
when you're usually so meticulous?

637
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,276
When you

638
00:51:13,987 --> 00:51:15,447
beat me up the other day…

639
00:51:15,530 --> 00:51:16,948
THE TWO SAMPLES ARE COMPLETELY IDENTICAL

640
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:20,827
I got jealous of Taeyong.

641
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:25,415
I realized the importance
of a blood relationship.

642
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,004
I started to resent my late parents,
you see.

643
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:36,426
Stop beating around the bush,
and tell me what you want.

644
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:40,764
That was fast.

645
00:51:41,556 --> 00:51:43,058
You're done calculating. Is that it?

646
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:50,065
Give me all the properties, bonds,
and stocks under Taeyong's name.

647
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,985
Right, you were also going to give 2%
of the Dosin Holdings shares to him.

648
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:56,029
I need that too.

649
00:51:57,197 --> 00:51:58,323
One more thing.

650
00:51:59,407 --> 00:52:00,784
What is it?

651
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:03,245
Send Taeyong to the States immediately.

652
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,628
Just who took the suitcase?

653
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,506
This is my fault.

654
00:52:15,674 --> 00:52:18,468
Juhee, I'm so sorry.

655
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,888
Why did I have to panic then?

656
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:26,935
Don't blame yourself, Seungcheon.

657
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,355
It was me. I lost the suitcase.

658
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,524
Juhee.

659
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:34,442
I felt uncomfortable
ever since my brother said

660
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,361
it was my dad's slush fund.

661
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,614
It ended up slipping through my hands.

662
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,536
I guess it wasn't meant to be mine.

663
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,706
So don't feel so bad.

664
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,584
I'll get going, then.

665
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:52,836
Ju…

666
00:52:54,671 --> 00:52:55,630
Juhee…

667
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:18,153
What do I do?

668
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,657
That money meant so much to her.

669
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:39,841
Why are you telling me this now?

670
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:43,553
I felt too sorry to tell you.

671
00:53:44,054 --> 00:53:46,431
I don't think I can keep drawing.

672
00:53:46,514 --> 00:53:47,974
That's not important right now!

673
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:52,687
We'll go to the hospital first.

674
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:58,109
-If you get surgery and rehab--
-We don't even know if I'll fully recover.

675
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,611
We can't afford to waste our money.

676
00:53:59,694 --> 00:54:01,029
Honey!

677
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,823
I'm okay. I can get another job.

678
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,951
My left hand is fine, look.

679
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:07,994
Goodness.

680
00:54:09,287 --> 00:54:10,163
Huh?

681
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,749
I said, I'm fine. Look.

682
00:54:12,832 --> 00:54:13,917
Look at me.

683
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:19,089
Jeez, don't cry. There's no need to cry.

684
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:20,924
What do we do?

685
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:24,844
Don't cry, I'm sorry. I'm all right.

686
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:28,640
I'm sorry.

687
00:54:30,892 --> 00:54:32,227
Don't cry.

688
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,439
Don't cry.

689
00:55:06,094 --> 00:55:08,763
I want money too!

690
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:12,309
I want to be rich!

691
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:17,105
Why do I have to suffer so much for money?

692
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,540
I wish I were Hwang Taeyong.

693
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:40,253
Then I'd give money to Juhee

694
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,631
and pay for my dad's treatment.

695
00:55:56,895 --> 00:55:58,730
INCOMING CALL

696
00:56:01,316 --> 00:56:02,317
Hello?

697
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,197
Alex Boo?

698
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:11,451
Don't you remember me?
I lent you 50,000 won.

699
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:15,789
I know. Did you just call me
to get your money back?

700
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:19,250
No.

701
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:24,631
Hey, shameless fellow.
Are you interested in making money?

702
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:42,232
Are you here to meet your father?

703
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,442
Follow me.

704
00:57:01,876 --> 00:57:02,794
Father.

705
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:13,555
Uncle, what do you think you're doing?

706
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:14,472
You already know!

707
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:18,977
A murderer like you should be punished.

708
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,021
Get a taste of the beating
that your dad gave me.

709
00:57:30,029 --> 00:57:32,657
I didn't kill President Na.
I didn't kill him!

710
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:34,659
People might actually believe you.

711
00:57:35,869 --> 00:57:38,246
Don't sound so sincere,
you've killed people before.

712
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,753
You killed them all in the States.

713
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:50,592
Your father covered it up with money,
but you did kill them.

714
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:53,511
What? Can't you remember?

715
00:57:54,179 --> 00:57:56,431
Fine, I'll make you remember it.

716
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:16,159
These brats are finally quiet.

717
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,633
Don't kill me.

718
00:58:34,385 --> 00:58:35,470
Please don't kill me.

719
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:38,723
Taeyong, you killed them.

720
00:58:39,265 --> 00:58:40,600
"Mommy, Mommy."

721
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:43,603
You were so annoyed to see them whine

722
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,397
that you taught them a lesson.

723
00:58:50,985 --> 00:58:52,070
Right?

724
00:58:58,493 --> 00:58:59,494
How's that?

725
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:02,247
Do you remember it now?

726
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,253
Then I'll leave it up to you.

727
00:59:08,336 --> 00:59:10,838
-I'll give you a call.
-Thank you.

728
00:59:13,383 --> 00:59:14,467
Juhee.

729
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,262
Yeojin.

730
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:21,140
I heard you moved out,
but I didn't know you were here.

731
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:23,142
Did you have dinner?

732
00:59:25,144 --> 00:59:26,312
Yeojin.

733
00:59:27,939 --> 00:59:29,440
That suitcase…

734
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:32,944
Ah, I'm having a pajama party here
with my friends.

735
00:59:33,528 --> 00:59:35,321
Is that yours?

736
00:59:37,198 --> 00:59:39,534
It's dented here. I have the same one.

737
00:59:39,617 --> 00:59:41,077
Are you sure this is yours?

738
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:44,789
You really are the same
as you were in middle school.

739
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,542
You accused Jeong Nara
of stealing your watch.

740
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:50,044
Now you're accusing me of stealing.

741
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:51,838
That's not what I meant.

742
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:04,100
Here, check for yourself.

743
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:28,166
Happy now?

744
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:32,211
I'm sorry, Yeojin.

745
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,966
Actually, I'm not in my right mind.

746
01:00:37,342 --> 01:00:39,135
There was money in my suitcase.

747
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:42,680
And I lost it.

748
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,768
Then you must be penniless.

749
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,853
Should I give you some?

750
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:50,688
Do you remember?

751
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,984
Remember what you did when we tried
to help Jeong Nara with her field trip?

752
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:59,155
Guys, let's share our opinions
about how much we should collect for Nara.

753
01:00:59,238 --> 01:01:00,490
Let's make it 5,000 won.

754
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,033
That's too little.

755
01:01:02,116 --> 01:01:03,242
Let's go with 7,000 won.

756
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:05,578
How about 10,000 won?

757
01:01:07,789 --> 01:01:09,499
You guys are so mean.

758
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:13,086
How can you discuss how much
we should collect for her in her face?

759
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:14,712
Think of how she must feel.

760
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:19,008
Because of what you said,
Nara couldn't go on the field trip.

761
01:01:19,092 --> 01:01:22,804
At that time, she needed money,
not your petty sense of justice.

762
01:01:24,013 --> 01:01:25,181
Money for her field trip.

763
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,142
But I'm not like you.

764
01:01:28,226 --> 01:01:30,395
Money is what you need right now.

765
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,730
I know it too well.

766
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,781
Here, take it.

767
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:44,033
You need money.

768
01:01:53,835 --> 01:01:54,919
Never mind.

769
01:01:56,087 --> 01:01:58,381
You should be given a chance to learn.

770
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:02,677
Experience what it feels like to be poor.

771
01:02:24,824 --> 01:02:28,411
You shouldn't have acted so arrogant.

772
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:41,799
Hey.

773
01:02:43,176 --> 01:02:44,260
You can have this.

774
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,376
What is this?

775
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,285
I bought a very expensive jacket.

776
01:04:44,171 --> 01:04:47,049
Why do I have to go to the States?
I didn't kill anyone!

777
01:04:53,180 --> 01:04:54,140
You're right.

778
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:57,894
You didn't kill anyone.

779
01:04:58,853 --> 01:04:59,896
I also think that way.

780
01:05:00,479 --> 01:05:02,982
Then let me stay here.
I don't want to go to the States.

781
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:05,443
No, I can't go there. Please, Father.

782
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:06,569
Snap out of it!

783
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,572
Because of you,

784
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,617
I had to spend all this money.
Do you even know how much it is?

785
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,916
You'll go to the States

786
01:05:19,999 --> 01:05:22,293
because it's the last chance
I'll give you.

787
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:28,341
Guess how much I spent
to give you that chance.

788
01:05:28,799 --> 01:05:32,511
Come back when you're ready
to do the money's worth.

789
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,889
Before then,
don't even think about returning.

790
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:50,613
Get out. I'd like to be alone.

791
01:05:55,576 --> 01:05:56,577
Yes, sir.

792
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:17,181
I can't believe
Taeyong really is the murderer.

793
01:06:18,224 --> 01:06:20,101
Damn it, what do I do?

794
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,186
Mom and Dad think Taeyong is me.

795
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:25,356
They obviously won't believe me
even if I warn them.

796
01:06:37,994 --> 01:06:39,578
"ST. JEROME SCHOOL SHOOTING,
THE WITNESS WAS A KOREAN STUDENT"

797
01:07:04,603 --> 01:07:06,480
He went to the same school
with Seo Juntae?

798
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:08,899
You used to be so intimidated
around Juntae.

799
01:07:09,483 --> 01:07:11,694
He always put the blame on you
for whatever he did wrong.

800
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,618
The total is 535,300 won including tax
and service charge for 2 nights.

801
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:41,223
I received 550,000 won.

802
01:07:42,850 --> 01:07:44,643
The change is 14,700 won.

803
01:07:54,111 --> 01:07:56,906
TAEYONG:
JUHEE… I'M LEAVING FOR THE STATES TODAY

804
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:03,037
Thank you.

805
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,209
Juhee, I'm leaving for the States today.

806
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,130
I hate to leave my family and you behind,

807
01:08:13,714 --> 01:08:15,424
but I think I must go.

808
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,052
Because I've got something to do.

809
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:22,556
I wonder when I will get to see you again.

810
01:08:26,977 --> 01:08:29,105
Sorry I'm leaving without saying goodbye.

811
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:35,111
JUNGJUN DINER

812
01:08:35,194 --> 01:08:37,655
I went househunting,
and the house only had two rooms.

813
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:38,864
Two rooms?

814
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:40,825
That's not a problem.

815
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:44,328
Seungcheon, sleep
in the living room since you're a guy.

816
01:08:44,411 --> 01:08:47,164
No, I can't do that!
I want a room.

817
01:08:48,332 --> 01:08:49,959
Let's play rock-paper-scissors to decide.

818
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,335
-Okay.
-Fine.

819
01:08:51,418 --> 01:08:52,920
-Loser sleeps in the living room?
-Yes.

820
01:08:53,003 --> 01:08:54,755
-This is for real, Dad.
-Okay.

821
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,799
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

822
01:08:57,550 --> 01:08:59,885
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

823
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,225
Okay.

824
01:09:08,435 --> 01:09:11,272
I made a promise that
I'd be there whenever you needed me,

825
01:09:12,356 --> 01:09:13,607
but I don't think I can keep it.

826
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:16,652
All right then. This time,
the loser will get slapped in the back.

827
01:09:21,115 --> 01:09:23,617
-One, two, three, let's go!
-Let's go!

828
01:09:25,953 --> 01:09:28,455
I guess I'll also have to break
the promise of coming back to them

829
01:09:29,832 --> 01:09:31,041
with lots of money.

830
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:41,927
I didn't do it for too long.
It was the normal amount.

831
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,346
This is what you say
as you slap the loser.

832
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:46,098
-Let's do another round.
-One more?

833
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:48,517
-Rock-paper-scissors.
-Rock-paper-scissors.

834
01:09:48,601 --> 01:09:49,935
-Why aren't you playing?
-Mom.

835
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,353
-Come here.
-Bend down.

836
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:52,688
-Come.
-Wait, no!

837
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,405
You know you have to be
careful of reporters, right?

838
01:10:01,906 --> 01:10:04,533
Stay away from Koreans for the time being.

839
01:10:06,160 --> 01:10:09,038
And there's no need
to contact the president.

840
01:10:15,085 --> 01:10:17,588
When the time comes,
he will reach out to you himself.

841
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:25,095
Young master, let's go.

842
01:10:34,605 --> 01:10:36,065
Hwang Taeyong! Taeyong!

843
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:44,281
Thank goodness. I thought I'd miss you.

844
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:45,741
Juhee.

845
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,161
How did you come here?

846
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,622
I read your text.

847
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,668
I should see you off
since you're going far away.

848
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:03,676
But why are you leaving so suddenly?

849
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,345
And what's that thing you have to do?

850
01:11:08,013 --> 01:11:09,056
The thing is…

851
01:11:09,473 --> 01:11:12,309
This is an announcement from
Star Airlines of Sky Alliance.

852
01:11:12,768 --> 01:11:14,812
If you're flying on Star Airlines 123

853
01:11:14,895 --> 01:11:17,439
-headed to New York…
-Young master.

854
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,442
-…please come to Gate One immediately.
-I need to go, Juhee.

855
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:21,902
-Thank you for coming.
-Thank you.

856
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:25,406
Take care.

857
01:11:48,846 --> 01:11:51,140
Someone visited him that day.

858
01:11:52,141 --> 01:11:54,435
I can't believe whom you came with.

859
01:11:56,603 --> 01:11:57,604
No way.

860
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,774
It can't be.

861
01:12:07,281 --> 01:12:08,282
Hwang Taeyong.

862
01:12:23,088 --> 01:12:24,131
Don't tell me…

863
01:12:26,133 --> 01:12:27,134
it was you.

864
01:12:31,805 --> 01:12:32,806
Did you

865
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:35,392
kill my dad?

866
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:39,980
No, Juhee. I--

867
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,106
You did.

868
01:12:42,066 --> 01:12:43,359
So it was you.

869
01:12:45,819 --> 01:12:48,822
How could you do this? Hwang Taeyong.

870
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:50,699
How could you do such a thing?

871
01:12:50,783 --> 01:12:52,326
How could you do this to me?

872
01:12:52,409 --> 01:12:55,704
-Juhee, hear me out. It wasn't me.
-Hwang Taeyong, how could you…

873
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,499
How could you do that to my dad?

874
01:12:58,582 --> 01:13:01,043
-Juhee.
-How could you?

875
01:13:01,126 --> 01:13:03,253
How could you? Hwang Taeyong!

876
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:04,630
What are you waiting for?

877
01:13:04,713 --> 01:13:07,424
-Escort him inside.
-How could you do that to my dad?

878
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:09,676
-Young master, we must go.
-Hwang Taeyong!

879
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,179
Hwang Taeyong, how could you?

880
01:13:12,262 --> 01:13:13,389
Hwang Taeyong!

881
01:13:36,036 --> 01:13:38,997
The price of Bitcoin is
skyrocketing again.

882
01:13:39,081 --> 01:13:41,583
The index of KOSPI has exceeded
3,300 for the first time ever.

883
01:13:41,750 --> 01:13:44,795
The K-pop group, Mellow,
has topped the Billboard chart.

884
01:13:44,878 --> 01:13:47,214
The average price of apartments in Seoul

885
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:50,092
-has surpassed 1.2 billion won.
-The National Weather Service has stated

886
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,386
-this year's heat wave as the hottest…
-Dosin Electronics

887
01:13:52,469 --> 01:13:54,054
recorded its highest sales to date…

888
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:59,059
DOSIN ELECTRONICS' FIRST-QUARTER SALES
67 TRILLION, HIGHEST EVER

889
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:07,067
MAY, 2022

890
01:15:05,417 --> 01:15:06,418
Hey.

891
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,506
Hey, wake up.

892
01:15:15,219 --> 01:15:16,428
Where am I?

893
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:29,191
You?

894
01:16:07,980 --> 01:16:09,606
Long time no see, Na Juhee.

895
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:11,400
I heard that you looked everywhere for me.

896
01:16:12,109 --> 01:16:13,402
Here it is.

897
01:16:13,902 --> 01:16:16,363
President Na's bloodstain
was on Taeyong's jacket.

898
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:19,950
If you could become rich,
would you swap your parents?

899
01:16:20,033 --> 01:16:22,536
Now is the time to go further.

900
01:16:22,619 --> 01:16:23,996
You dare to touch my money?

901
01:16:24,454 --> 01:16:25,581
You're finished.

902
01:16:25,998 --> 01:16:29,710
Whatever you do, I'll reveal
the truth behind my dad's death.

903
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,254
The real fight begins now.
