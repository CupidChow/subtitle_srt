EPISODE 2

2
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,138
BASED ON THE NAVER WEBTOON
THE GOLDEN SPOON BY HD3

3
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:00,977
What are you doing?

4
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,645
Hey, kid!

5
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,314
Jeez.

6
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:08,234
Hey, kid! What are you doing?

7
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:11,738
Money can solve everything.

8
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:14,032
I'll pay you. Here, take this.

9
00:01:14,115 --> 00:01:16,076
Please show mercy.
Show us mercy this once.

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,203
How dare you try me, bastard?

11
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,455
Don't you want to become rich?

12
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,485
President Hwang, I'm here
to ask you for a favor.

13
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,402
A favor?

14
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:54,405
Could I have a meal?

15
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,449
A meal?

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,661
I know you don't like me.
This will be my last request.

17
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,705
Could I have

18
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:04,874
just one meal?

19
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:21,224
Young master, are you okay?

20
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,725
Munki.

21
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,770
Turn the car around.
I need to go back there.

22
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:27,939
-I can't turn from here.
-Then just pull over!

23
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:29,691
Hurry up!

24
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,778
Hurry up! Stop the car!

25
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:44,372
Young master! Young master!

26
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,292
Do you always carry that spoon around?

27
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:34,964
Interesting.

28
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,467
Why do you carry it around?

29
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:40,470
Because I want to

30
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,972
change my fate.

31
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,350
Your fate?

32
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:49,395
I don't believe it.

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,814
It's ludicrous.

34
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,026
But those who are truly desperate

35
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,362
do such foolish things.

36
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:02,116
I'm not sure
what you're so desperate about.

37
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:05,828
But enjoy.

38
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,798
TAEYONG

39
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,551
Seungcheon took his money?

40
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:45,094
No way. That's not what I saw.

41
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:51,517
Who is it?

42
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,479
I'm Hwang Taeyong's friend.

43
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,397
Have you booked an appointment with him?

44
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,774
Let me rephrase that.

45
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,819
I'm Na Juhee, Hwang Taeyong's fiancée.

46
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,447
What's going on?

47
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,700
She said we'd switch lives
if I ate three meals.

48
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,330
Did we really switch lives?

49
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,457
Or…

50
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,214
What is it?

51
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,425
Why are you staring at me like that?

52
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,264
-What?
-Let's get going if you're done.

53
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,605
Dad?

54
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:40,983
"Dad?"

55
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:43,820
Did you…

56
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,493
just call me "Dad"?

57
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:07,218
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that.

58
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:21,566
Na Juhee?

59
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,568
Long time no see. Hwang Taeyong, you jerk!

60
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,612
"Hwang Taeyong?"

61
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:29,449
That's what she called me.

62
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,372
What did you just say?

63
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,541
What? Are you offended?

64
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,502
How could you do that to Lee Seungcheon?

65
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:43,212
Juhee?

66
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,136
It's been a while.

67
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,512
But I have a question.

68
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,141
What are you doing to my Taeyong?

69
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:56,559
"My Taeyong"?

70
00:07:57,143 --> 00:08:00,188
-Sir.
-President Na told me about your transfer.

71
00:08:00,771 --> 00:08:03,858
-Can you explain what just happened?
-We really switched lives.

72
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,942
I'm sorry.

73
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,945
He framed a friend of ours
with a ridiculous lie.

74
00:08:08,029 --> 00:08:09,155
Honey.

75
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,537
I'm sorry for visiting you so late, sir.

76
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,456
I'm Kang Hyunjoong
of Regional Investigations

77
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,333
from the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

78
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,628
Is Mr. Hwang Taeyong your son?

79
00:08:23,711 --> 00:08:24,837
What is this about?

80
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:27,673
A student named Lee Seungcheon
went missing near the Han River.

81
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:28,758
And there was a report

82
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,844
that your son was there with him.

83
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,682
We'd like to ask him a few questions.

84
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:39,185
Call Attorney Go.

85
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,857
Seungcheon is missing?

86
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:54,075
Can you tell me what happened?

87
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,744
WRITTEN TESTIMONY
NAME: HWANG TAEYONG

88
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:59,497
We just had a fight.

89
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,207
Can you elaborate?

90
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,876
Where, why, and how did you fight?

91
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,254
Was it physical or just verbal?

92
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,922
He's only here to testify.

93
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:10,258
Taeyong, you don't need to answer that.

94
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,718
So you won't cooperate?

95
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,804
Fine, then.

96
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:17,890
Take a look.

97
00:10:09,734 --> 00:10:11,110
Yes, sir.

98
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:15,281
Of course, sir. You don't need to worry.

99
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,657
We'll take care of it.

100
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,146
Why would Seungcheon fall into the water?

101
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,981
Why would he?

102
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:50,733
Seungcheon.

103
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,401
-Mom.
-Honey.

104
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,778
Stay strong.

105
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,988
I'm sure he's fine.

106
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,115
-He should be fine, right?
-They're searching for him,

107
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,909
so we'll hear from them soon.

108
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,494
So it's nothing serious, right?

109
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,204
-Please calm down.
-Taeyong?

110
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,374
Taeyong.

111
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:07,291
Mom.

112
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,752
Taeyong. Taeyong.

113
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,463
Have you seen Seungcheon?

114
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,299
They're saying he fell into the water.

115
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:17,468
Do you know anything?

116
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:20,012
Look at this. Did you fall in as well?

117
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:21,972
Hey, tell us the truth.

118
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:23,808
Something happened between you two, right?

119
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:26,060
You were together, right?

120
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,145
Watch what you say.

121
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,980
Taeyong, let's go.

122
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,401
Taeyong.

123
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,611
Seungcheon isn't hurt, is he?

124
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,197
He's all that I have.

125
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:41,075
So please answer me.

126
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:43,119
Taeyong…

127
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,371
-Mo…
-Let's go.

128
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,706
Taeyong.

129
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:50,751
-Taeyong, please answer me.
-Hey!

130
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,754
Taeyong, please…

131
00:11:53,838 --> 00:11:54,755
Honey.

132
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,465
-Taeyong…
-Honey!

133
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:59,051
-Get him! Hwang Taeyong!
-All right!

134
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,096
Let her go. Okay.

135
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,598
TRUSTWORTHY POLICE, SAFE COUNTRY

136
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:14,817
Young master!

137
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,902
Young master.

138
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,405
What happened?

139
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,574
You suddenly jumped out of a moving car.

140
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,491
And why are you here?

141
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:25,369
Taeyong jumped out of a moving car?

142
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:26,829
Pardon?

143
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,039
Can I borrow your phone, sir?

144
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,632
MUNKI

145
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,181
Why isn't he picking up?

146
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,058
Did something happen?

147
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,935
MUNKI

148
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,482
Hello? Hello?

149
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:57,234
Taeyong?

150
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,904
Taeyong.

151
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,366
YOUNG MASTER TAEYONG

152
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:06,744
Young master!

153
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:08,496
Young master!

154
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,748
They found Lee Seungcheon.

155
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,251
They found your son.

156
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,754
-Where is he?
-He's at the hospital right now.

157
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:18,881
-Is he okay?
-We'll talk on our way there.

158
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,883
-Okay. Let's hurry.
-Let's go.

159
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:23,552
-Is he okay?
-He's at the hospital, so he should be.

160
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,976
Seungcheon.

161
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,113
Seungcheon.

162
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:47,117
Seungcheon.

163
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,251
Mom?

164
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,339
Yes, it's me.

165
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:07,346
You jerk. We were worried sick
because of you.

166
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,973
Are you okay?

167
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:14,520
Mom.

168
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,358
-Mom.
-Yes, it's me.

169
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,028
Seungcheon.

170
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,614
Thank you so much for being alive.

171
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,868
Thank you so much.

172
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,414
Mom.

173
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,332
BONGJIN HOSPITAL

174
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:42,548
I'm sorry.

175
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,845
I'm sorry.

176
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:50,014
Where is he?

177
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:00,774
I'm sorry.

178
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,237
Lee Seungcheon.

179
00:15:14,747 --> 00:15:18,584
Why did he call me "Lee Seungcheon?"

180
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,551
Why did you call out your own name?

181
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:30,095
Did I? I did that?

182
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,057
Poor you.

183
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,893
Hey, maybe you should get a CT scan.

184
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:43,275
Hwang Taeyong. Why are you here?

185
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,665
They found him passed out on the road.

186
00:15:58,248 --> 00:15:59,959
Thankfully, he wasn't hurt.

187
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,170
Perhaps it's because he fell
into the water, but he's a bit out of it.

188
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,631
It must've been when the spoon changed.

189
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:08,384
The doctor said he'll be fine.

190
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:10,010
So he'll be okay.

191
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,389
Still, thank you
for coming to the hospital.

192
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:16,141
Dad, why are you thanking him?

193
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,644
Be honest. You pushed him, didn't you?

194
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,729
-Sungah.
-Right?

195
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,816
That's a bit harsh.
That's not what happened.

196
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,234
Don't make me laugh.

197
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,403
Hey, you're more than capable
of doing that.

198
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,072
You even lied
so he'd get kicked out of school.

199
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,908
-You did push him!
-No.

200
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:36,578
I pushed him.

201
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,706
What on earth are you saying?

202
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,668
Mom, I told you he should get a CT scan.

203
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,170
I think there's something wrong
with his brain.

204
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:46,505
He remembers.

205
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,300
What happened to him?

206
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:58,392
Who do you think you are?
How dare you try me, bastard?

207
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,064
Didn't I?

208
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,984
I can't quite remember.

209
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,986
I think I pushed him.

210
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,945
It was an accident.

211
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:13,574
We got into a fight,
and he accidentally fell in.

212
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:14,867
Right, Seungcheon?

213
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:17,745
Is that right?

214
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:20,539
It's okay since everyone's fine.

215
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,958
-In any case, I'm sorry for worrying you.
-It's okay.

216
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,794
Speaking of which…

217
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,963
We'd like to drop
the school violence case.

218
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,842
That's President Hwang's wish,
so please act accordingly.

219
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,635
Thank you, principal.

220
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,058
What about the police?

221
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,935
The victim won't press charges.

222
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,772
We got rid of the witness' video,
so no need to worry.

223
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:45,689
Good.

224
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,901
Well done. You may go.

225
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:57,659
It's not over.

226
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,829
Taeyong and Lee Seungcheon.

227
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:05,000
Someone recognized those boys
even through the dark.

228
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,378
Which means the witness
knows them very well.

229
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,172
Perhaps a classmate.

230
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,716
Or someone who's trying to harass Taeyong.

231
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,015
-Look for them.
-Yes, sir.

232
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,019
This is awesome.

233
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:54,985
Jeez.

234
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:57,905
Where in the world
is Hwang Taeyong's room?

235
00:20:15,964 --> 00:20:18,425
Oh!

236
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,470
Hey, what's your problem?
Don't you know how to knock?

237
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,430
I'm sorry, Mom.

238
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:25,891
What?

239
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:28,727
"Mom?"

240
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:33,732
It's nice that you called me that.

241
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,402
But don't let your father hear you.

242
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,197
You should address us
as "Father" and "Mother."

243
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,784
Okay, Mother.

244
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,827
Why are you here at this hour?

245
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,454
Well…

246
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,582
I wanted to apologize
for worrying you today.

247
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,626
I'm sorry. Good night.

248
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:54,753
Wait.

249
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:57,756
Hwang Taeyong.

250
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,009
You're being really odd today.

251
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,470
What do you mean?

252
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,639
You called me "Mom"

253
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:07,933
and even apologized to me.

254
00:21:11,603 --> 00:21:13,772
Who are you? Are you really Hwang Taeyong?

255
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:31,540
Don't pretend to be nice,
and just be yourself.

256
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:32,582
Isn't that easier?

257
00:21:35,627 --> 00:21:36,920
Why are you still here?

258
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,590
Right. Good night.

259
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,107
Young master.

260
00:21:58,859 --> 00:21:59,901
Sir.

261
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,245
Aren't you too tired today to read?

262
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,706
It's for a school assignment.

263
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:16,460
Is that why you also needed
your house's floor plan

264
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:17,919
and all the employees' resumes?

265
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,590
That's because

266
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,176
I want to discipline them more.

267
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,562
Where are you going, sir?

268
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,441
Jeez, I must be out of it.

269
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,121
-Thank you, sir.
-Young master.

270
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,125
Are you perhaps upset with me?

271
00:22:57,209 --> 00:23:00,295
You're suddenly using honorifics.

272
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,464
And you're calling me "Sir."

273
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,094
Ah. I wanted to become a different person.

274
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,971
But I'll just treat you like normal.
Thanks, Munki.

275
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,487
Today must've been
a really rough day for him.

276
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,967
This is his room?

277
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,438
No way.

278
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,881
Is that me?

279
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:32,012
Everything around you will change
except for you.

280
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:35,932
And it will be very natural.

281
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:45,859
The old woman was right.

282
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,418
What is this?

283
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:25,899
You have three chances.

284
00:25:25,982 --> 00:25:28,276
After one month, one year,

285
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,154
and ten years.

286
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,658
You can come by
and make your decisions then.

287
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,620
Whether to return
to your original parents or not.

288
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,637
So I have the chance
to switch parents again

289
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:58,348
after 29 days?

290
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:05,814
This is so fascinating.

291
00:26:07,524 --> 00:26:09,067
Maybe this is real gold.

292
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,085
-Janggun.
-Hey.

293
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,297
You're here.

294
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,802
-That's him, right?
-Yes.

295
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,388
How is he so good-looking?

296
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:40,557
-I envy his life.
-What a nice car.

297
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:42,475
-Just look at his car.
-Awesome.

298
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,941
I knew it. Money is the best.

299
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,319
Sure, she's the daughter
of UBS TV's president.

300
00:26:52,402 --> 00:26:54,487
But she got kicked out
of her school in the UK.

301
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:58,325
The daughter of UBS TV's president?

302
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,827
So she's cute and all

303
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,037
but has a nasty personality.

304
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,956
I heard her older brothers
are garbage too, right?

305
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,000
-Exactly.
-That's what I heard too.

306
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,418
Probably not as trashy as you.

307
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:09,961
What?

308
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,881
Hey, what did he just say?

309
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:14,966
-Come on.
-He's been dissing me

310
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:16,676
-for the past three days!
-Come on.

311
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,192
Hey, Hwang Taeyong.

312
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:34,527
Hwang Taeyong!

313
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:43,078
Why are you sitting there?
That's Seungcheon's seat.

314
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:53,004
Right.

315
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:56,716
What is this?

316
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,183
Taeyong! The homeroom teacher's
calling you to the office.

317
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:12,023
Gosh. Are you getting a reward

318
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,359
for saving Underdog?

319
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:30,834
What's going on?

320
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,882
It's so hot.

321
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:40,510
I think he's feeling under the weather.

322
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,928
That's what he told me.

323
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,764
Oh Yeojin, why are you snickering?

324
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,729
Goodness, gracious.

325
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,399
Your father is truly amazing.

326
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,443
Lee Seungcheon deserved to be punished.

327
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,904
I guess those who have succeeded
in life are incredibly generous.

328
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,200
Ms. Kim, please do a thorough
background check on the new students.

329
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,910
What's our purpose?

330
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,163
-Nurturing global talents.
-That's right.

331
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,373
We should only accept students
who are qualified.

332
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:21,426
I don't think you have the right
to talk about qualifications.

333
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:23,219
What?

334
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,056
Lee Seungcheon was always innocent.

335
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:28,600
Everything

336
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,770
was made up by me.

337
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:34,189
You both knew that.

338
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:39,444
Taeyong, why are you suddenly saying that?

339
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:42,363
You were ready to kick him out of school

340
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,699
without even checking the facts.

341
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,076
Before judging your students,

342
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,579
you should think long and hard
about whether or not

343
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,373
you deserve to teach anyone.

344
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:55,126
You…

345
00:29:56,085 --> 00:29:58,046
You little…

346
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:01,883
I believe the biggest virtue
in becoming a global talent

347
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,176
is honesty.

348
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:08,097
Speaking of which, are you aware

349
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,975
of the midterm cheating incident?

350
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:11,893
Okay.

351
00:30:12,477 --> 00:30:13,311
Hey.

352
00:30:14,187 --> 00:30:15,605
Who are you to tell Taeyong

353
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,274
where he can or cannot sit?

354
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,652
-What gives you the right?
-That wasn't me.

355
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,322
What about it?

356
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,741
Why can't I tell him
to sit in his original seat?

357
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:27,951
That was Seungcheon's seat.

358
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:29,369
Is that so?

359
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,915
Look at that.
Birds of a feather flock together.

360
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,376
You're just as rude as Underdog is.

361
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:40,421
Oh, my.

362
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:42,090
It was you, Janggun.

363
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:46,094
-What…
-Sorry, I didn't know it was you.

364
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,435
It's okay. It's only a mistake.

365
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,980
They were being quite cheeky,

366
00:30:57,063 --> 00:30:58,147
so I was disciplining them.

367
00:30:58,231 --> 00:31:00,358
-Don't worry and go on your way.
-You can go.

368
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,860
Say that again. What was that?

369
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:05,238
What? What did I do so wrong?

370
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,322
Brace yourself.

371
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,492
Does this hurt? Are you mad?
Are you offended?

372
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:14,122
Hey, Hwang Taeyong.

373
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,139
It's normal to feel that way
when you get hit.

374
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:35,351
I wanted you to have a taste
of your own medicine.

375
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,770
What's wrong? Did I hurt your feelings?

376
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:45,194
That hurts like hell.

377
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,829
No, you didn't hurt my feelings.

378
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:01,210
You guys. Save my number.

379
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,589
If they touch you ever again,

380
00:32:05,423 --> 00:32:06,966
call me right away.

381
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:10,261
-You can go.
-Okay.

382
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,055
-Thanks, Taeyong.
-Thanks.

383
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:15,016
You little…

384
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:21,314
You enjoy power-tripping, don't you?

385
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,485
Aren't you curious
about how I'll abuse my power?

386
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,654
Harass them again, and you'll find out.

387
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:35,578
-Janggun, are you okay?
-Hey.

388
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,664
-I thought your ear would fall off.
-What's with him?

389
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,582
-Relax.
-Has he gone insane?

390
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,093
Park Janggun.

391
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,929
This is only the beginning.

392
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,310
Hwang Taeyong, we need to talk.

393
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,361
Why did you lie?

394
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,406
I was part-timing and saw you
giving money to Seungcheon.

395
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,324
That's strange.

396
00:33:13,783 --> 00:33:17,036
I wonder why the daughter
of UBS TV's president was part-timing.

397
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,455
Mimicking the commoners' lifestyle?

398
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,625
Taeyong, that's not important right now.

399
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:27,088
Na Juhee. Why are you so involved
in Lee Seungcheon's problem?

400
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,297
You don't know him.

401
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,968
You're right. I don't.

402
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,636
But I do know one thing.

403
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,722
Lee Seungcheon worked hard
at living his life.

404
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,391
While you received
private tutoring worth millions,

405
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:40,435
he worked for 4,000 won an hour.

406
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,480
He eats triangular gimbap while memorizing
English words to save money.

407
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:47,984
He's not like you and me
who benefit thanks to our parents.

408
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:50,570
If you have an ounce of conscience,

409
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:53,156
don't harass him.

410
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,344
Do you know why
she's defending him so much?

411
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:19,599
A student died
in middle school because of her.

412
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:22,977
What do you mean?

413
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,022
Now you're interested?

414
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:29,442
Are you curious? Do you want to know?

415
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:34,113
Forget it. I'm not interested
in other people's gossip.

416
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:37,158
If anything, I'll ask her myself.

417
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:39,660
What's wrong? Do I seem cheap again?

418
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:45,333
-What?
-I didn't say much last time,

419
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,794
but I won't sit still
if you look down on me again.

420
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,297
Did Hwang Taeyong call her cheap?

421
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,469
Sorry, Oh Yeojin. I apologize for that.

422
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,347
That's not how you apologize.

423
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,689
Hey! Hey!

424
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,067
What was that for?

425
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,277
What have you done?

426
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:15,530
Hwang Taeyong, you only pretend.

427
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,490
But I actually do it.

428
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,208
What? Do what?

429
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:34,006
Jeez, he's been sleeping all day.

430
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:35,591
I wonder why.

431
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,802
He's been working too hard to survive.

432
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,470
With working part-time and studying.

433
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:41,931
We couldn't even send him to cram schools.

434
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,063
-Seungcheon.
-Hey.

435
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,359
What time is it?

436
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,486
-What time?
-It's before seven. What's wrong?

437
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,363
Father will be here soon.

438
00:35:57,446 --> 00:36:00,575
-I shouldn't be late.
-What do you mean? Your dad is right here.

439
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,034
What's wrong?

440
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,037
-Dad?
-Yes?

441
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:13,045
-Mom?
-Yes, it's me.

442
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,964
Did you have a nightmare?

443
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:18,718
It's okay, dear. Get some more sleep.

444
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,011
Lie down.

445
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,561
Rest up.

446
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,605
Mom.

447
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:33,357
Mom.

448
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,775
I'm here.

449
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:38,446
Mom.

450
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,931
-You're late.
-I'm sorry.

451
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,609
Let's eat.

452
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,697
Three words that define
President Hwang Hyeondo

453
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:23,950
are time, order,

454
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:26,535
and lastly, money.

455
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,414
His morning begins at 4 a.m.

456
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,625
He is briefed on Doshin Group's assets.

457
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,586
We will be announcing what to do
with Doshin Electronics' shares tomorrow.

458
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,924
We will be selling 269,867 shares.

459
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,301
The acquisition price is 409,027 won.

460
00:37:42,385 --> 00:37:43,719
What's the current price?

461
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,639
It's 1,048,632 won ever since we merged.

462
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:48,391
How's the patent lawsuit going?

463
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:50,893
They've submitted a petition
to the district court.

464
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:52,561
Neoken, that has ownership of the patent,

465
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,106
has entrusted AD Blues
with the right to file a suit.

466
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,859
How much are they demanding?

467
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,236
About 1.3 trillion won, sir.

468
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,738
Get the US Ministry
of Justice to handle it.

469
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:14,083
I won't allow the same mistake twice.

470
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,503
You're fired.

471
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:21,966
He's merciless about mistakes.

472
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,637
Not bad.

473
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:28,889
He's stingy with compliments.

474
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,058
Thank you for your decision.

475
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,768
But he does smile brightly at times.

476
00:38:32,852 --> 00:38:33,811
Bye.

477
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,064
Sir, congratulations.

478
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:40,359
The crown prince of Dubai has decided
to invest 15 trillion won.

479
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:43,529
-Is that so?
-Yes, sir.

480
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:45,448
Money.

481
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,784
Money is the only factor
that makes him smile.

482
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:57,251
The minister called to congratulate you
on the Dubai investment.

483
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,129
And Jinseok's family has accepted
the settlement fee

484
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,214
regarding the matter.

485
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:05,217
They were demanding
that I bring the family back.

486
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,846
But everyone caves in front of money.

487
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:11,557
Make sure the redevelopment project
goes as planned.

488
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,475
Yes, sir.

489
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,187
Do you see that?

490
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:25,446
From there to there.

491
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,991
It should be filled
with Doshin's apartment complexes.

492
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,035
Due to the opposition,
it won't be easy, sir.

493
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,873
This project is worth 20 trillion won.

494
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:39,919
-So you'd better focus.
-Yes, sir.

495
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:41,879
One more thing, sir.

496
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,715
Taeyong has been spending
quite the sum of money lately.

497
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:46,759
I thought you should know.

498
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,766
You don't normally wear these styles.

499
00:39:54,517 --> 00:39:56,268
Aren't you splurging too much today?

500
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:59,355
My monthly allowance is 80 million won,
this is nothing.

501
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:02,358
Right. Don't I have a fund in my name?
I want it liquidated.

502
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,068
Pardon? Your fund?

503
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:06,404
I'm indebted to someone.

504
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:08,697
Indebted?

505
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,417
Look. My mom got these for me.

506
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,711
Do you want those too?

507
00:40:23,587 --> 00:40:24,422
No.

508
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:27,800
I can't buy those.

509
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:34,140
But these were much more expensive.
So why…

510
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,154
I should get these.

511
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,867
TRUE COLORS OF SHAOLIN

512
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,246
Jeez.

513
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,631
What's gotten into you?

514
00:41:08,048 --> 00:41:09,800
You used to think my comics were cheesy.

515
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,760
Exactly. It's unlike him.

516
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,473
Is it because of the accident?

517
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,600
He's been more forgetful lately as well.

518
00:41:19,101 --> 00:41:22,813
Cut that nonsense.
The doctor said he'll get better.

519
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:26,108
Seungcheon, let's eat.

520
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,322
What is all this?

521
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:34,658
Kimchi stew.

522
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,578
Bulgogi.

523
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:40,289
Japchae?

524
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,543
This isn't a meal.
There's barely anything to eat.

525
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:46,879
Do you want to die?

526
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,049
She spent a week's worth
of grocery money on this.

527
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,300
Eat.

528
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:55,471
Fine. I'll eat.

529
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:02,937
Mm.

530
00:42:04,271 --> 00:42:06,148
What's wrong? Does it taste strange?

531
00:42:06,815 --> 00:42:07,858
What?

532
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:12,571
It's fine.

533
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:14,114
Yeah, it's strange.

534
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,038
It's so delicious.

535
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,248
What?

536
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:24,500
I've never had such tasty food before.

537
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,964
Your kimchi stew is the best.

538
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,932
Come on. It's nothing special.

539
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,394
Who is it?

540
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,981
-What's this?
-Who are you?

541
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:52,444
What brings you here?

542
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,280
Mr. Hwang Taeyong sent these.

543
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:06,041
Taeyong and his father
have dinner together every Friday evening.

544
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:09,003
It's a sort of training
to become the next heir.

545
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:13,090
Dom Pérignon for the aperitif.
Omit the cheese.

546
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:16,260
And for the beef tartare,
what I always get.

547
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,178
Yes, sir.

548
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,607
DINNER
APPETIZERS

549
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:36,697
-The same for me.
-Sure.

550
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,369
That's new.

551
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:45,247
You got tartare when you dislike raw meat.

552
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,416
Dad, I just…

553
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,712
I just wanted to get what you got, Father.

554
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,842
You've been spending quite a bit
of money lately unlike yourself.

555
00:43:57,885 --> 00:43:59,553
I had to spend it on some things.

556
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:07,686
When people have money,
they either spend or save it.

557
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,647
It's one or the other.

558
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,148
But my wish for you

559
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:15,986
is that you'll become someone
who can see past all the money.

560
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:19,573
Only those types of people
can conquer this world.

561
00:44:20,366 --> 00:44:23,077
What I'm saying is that
you shouldn't waste your money.

562
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,542
I understand.

563
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:31,752
However,

564
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:34,296
it's my money.

565
00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:37,007
Can't I spend it however I deem fit?

566
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:53,524
-Goodness, I'm sorry for being late.
-Hello, President Na.

567
00:44:54,316 --> 00:44:55,442
Na Juhee?

568
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:58,529
Gosh.

569
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:02,074
-My future son-in-law.
-"Son-in-law?"

570
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,909
You seem to have grown even more.

571
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,452
Hello, have you been well?

572
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,037
Of course.

573
00:45:07,830 --> 00:45:10,666
Hey, what are you doing?
Greet your fiancée.

574
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,084
"Fiancée?"

575
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,214
Fancy seeing you again.

576
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:20,175
Right.

577
00:45:27,766 --> 00:45:31,437
By the way, I am terribly sorry.

578
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,856
I can't believe that she hit him.

579
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,861
I apologize.

580
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,947
They must have had
a small misunderstanding.

581
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,657
I've known her long enough.

582
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,495
I'm truly thankful
that you think that way.

583
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:53,375
I'm sorry for troubling you two.

584
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,086
And you as well.

585
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:58,714
But I have something to say.

586
00:46:00,549 --> 00:46:03,177
I'm truly sorry for saying this.

587
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:07,181
But I can't go through
with this engagement.

588
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:11,852
Hey.

589
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,897
What are you talking about?

590
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,358
I'm well aware that our engagement
is crucial for your businesses.

591
00:46:18,442 --> 00:46:20,819
But I want to live my life, Dad.

592
00:46:22,821 --> 00:46:24,490
I've yet to know what I want in life.

593
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,493
I don't want to be tied down.

594
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,621
I don't want to live as someone's daughter
or as someone's fiancée.

595
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,414
I just want to be me.

596
00:46:33,248 --> 00:46:34,666
I'm truly sorry.

597
00:46:41,006 --> 00:46:43,425
Hey, Juhee!

598
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,635
Let me.

599
00:46:50,641 --> 00:46:53,811
But two high school kids
getting engaged already?

600
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:55,479
I found it ridiculous too.

601
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,402
What's gotten into them?

602
00:47:05,447 --> 00:47:06,281
President Hwang.

603
00:47:06,824 --> 00:47:10,118
She hasn't been herself
after suffering so much

604
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:13,121
-in the UK.
-That's all right.

605
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:17,334
Juhee sure has grown up well.

606
00:47:19,461 --> 00:47:20,796
Oh, dear.

607
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:36,186
She called off the engagement?

608
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:38,981
How bold of her.

609
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:43,360
How about you really put an end
to their engagement?

610
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,280
President Na's sons are troublemakers.

611
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:47,781
They have a bad reputation.

612
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:52,619
Don't be ridiculous.

613
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,081
Their engagement
is the least of my worries.

614
00:47:57,291 --> 00:47:58,292
Sorry?

615
00:47:59,459 --> 00:48:00,377
It's my money.

616
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,380
Can't I spend it however I deem fit?

617
00:48:04,464 --> 00:48:06,925
I should do something about it.

618
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:12,347
DAD

619
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:41,752
I'm dead meat once I go back home.

620
00:48:41,835 --> 00:48:42,794
3 MISSED CALLS

621
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,468
What is he doing there?

622
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:08,028
Say what you need to say
or buy what you need.

623
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,237
If you don't have anything,

624
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,782
then leave.

625
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:14,284
The customer service here
isn't that great.

626
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,703
By the way, why are you working alone?

627
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,247
Seungcheon is sick
and won't be coming in for a while.

628
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:21,708
It's all thanks to you.
Have you already forgotten?

629
00:49:22,501 --> 00:49:23,335
Right.

630
00:49:24,044 --> 00:49:26,922
Juhee, you were rather brave today.

631
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,760
You had the audacity
to call off our engagement.

632
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,303
But will you be okay?

633
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,938
That's why I need your help.

634
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:54,157
I think this looks more urgent.

635
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,706
Juhee, he's going to vomit any moment now.

636
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:04,292
No!

637
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:31,737
Give me that.

638
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,998
What are you looking at?
Wipe the shelves and…

639
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,505
You didn't check their expiration dates.

640
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:52,758
You should discard the old ones.

641
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,052
Right.

642
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,375
Jeez, my clothes reek.

643
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,378
You should thank me.

644
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:33,715
Taeyong, have you ever worked
at a convenience store before?

645
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:36,134
No, that can't be possible.

646
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:37,803
So why are you so good at it?

647
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,388
Beats me. Why am I so good at it?

648
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,517
I have a question.

649
00:51:44,184 --> 00:51:45,352
Why are you working here?

650
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,648
Because I want to earn my own money.

651
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,735
I came to Korea without telling my dad,
but I had no money.

652
00:51:53,902 --> 00:51:55,278
That's how I started.

653
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:58,365
But I felt proud
about earning my own money.

654
00:51:58,782 --> 00:52:01,868
I liked it.
I felt confident in front of my brothers.

655
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:03,453
Your brothers?

656
00:52:05,413 --> 00:52:07,582
Thanks, Taeyong.

657
00:52:07,666 --> 00:52:10,293
I thought you had come
because you were mad at me

658
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,546
for calling it off
without discussing it with you.

659
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,798
After all, we're childhood friends.

660
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:18,176
I'm not mad,
but I don't agree with you either.

661
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:23,056
-What?
-I'm weighing the pros and cons.

662
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,225
I'll see how well you treat me at school.

663
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,477
Hey, what do you mean?

664
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,520
Oh!

665
00:52:46,663 --> 00:52:47,747
-Let's go.
-What?

666
00:52:47,831 --> 00:52:50,292
-I mean, bye.
-Okay, bye.

667
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:52,043
Mm.

668
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,158
Young master.

669
00:53:34,586 --> 00:53:36,755
Has it been that long
since I last saw him?

670
00:53:38,256 --> 00:53:40,133
Why does he seem like a different person?

671
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,895
Hey!

672
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:53,521
Geumseok.

673
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,233
What…

674
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:58,985
You called off the engagement?

675
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,197
If we accepted you even though
your mom was a mere second wife,

676
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:05,283
-you should fulfill your duties.
-Geumseok.

677
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,535
My business is over
if President Hwang doesn't invest.

678
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:10,372
Apologize to him right now.

679
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:13,458
I'm sorry,
but it wasn't easy for me either.

680
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:15,085
How dare you talk back to me?

681
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:16,127
What are you doing?

682
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,964
You little bastard.

683
00:54:19,089 --> 00:54:21,883
Why are you being so harsh
to your baby sister?

684
00:54:22,467 --> 00:54:24,678
Why do you always take her side?

685
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,762
I don't want to hear it!

686
00:54:26,263 --> 00:54:27,639
Go back to your house.

687
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,310
We'll talk again later.

688
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:33,520
You little…

689
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:38,024
Jeez.

690
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,280
Are you okay?

691
00:54:44,239 --> 00:54:46,574
You shouldn't have called off
the engagement.

692
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:49,494
I'm sorry. But I--

693
00:54:49,577 --> 00:54:52,372
Don't want to live as someone's daughter
and just live as you?

694
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:54,582
You're so immature.

695
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:58,211
You'd be nothing
if you weren't Na Sangguk's daughter.

696
00:54:58,545 --> 00:55:01,631
You don't even know
what that means, do you?

697
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:05,427
Goodness. Forget it.

698
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,430
You're kind to the bone
just like your mom.

699
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,057
Come on in.

700
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,235
How dare you humiliate me?

701
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,029
You cheated on your exam?

702
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,113
And why didn't you tell me

703
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,490
-that you didn't get into Class Eagle?
-No.

704
00:55:27,574 --> 00:55:28,742
Why didn't you tell me?

705
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,162
-Honey!
-You need to be disciplined.

706
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:34,998
-Come here!
-Dad!

707
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,292
-Please calm down!
-You little…

708
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:39,627
You bastard.

709
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:44,507
You dare to run?

710
00:55:44,591 --> 00:55:45,759
Dad!

711
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:49,554
-Come here!
-Dad, I'm sorry! Please forgive me!

712
00:55:49,637 --> 00:55:52,265
I'm going to teach you a lesson
once and for all.

713
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,434
You'd better brace yourself!

714
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,605
Stay right there.

715
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,774
Where are my golf clubs?

716
00:56:00,857 --> 00:56:02,734
-Where are they?
-You must've gone crazy!

717
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,444
Why don't you just kill me?

718
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:05,779
Honey!

719
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,822
Lee Seungcheon.

720
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:10,825
It has to be him.

721
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,328
That bastard.

722
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:15,121
I'm going to kill him.

723
00:56:40,271 --> 00:56:43,608
Hi. Did you comfort Juhee?

724
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:50,240
What are you doing in my room?

725
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:53,952
What do you think?

726
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:56,329
Can't you see?

727
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,665
I'm fulfilling my duties as your mom.

728
00:56:59,165 --> 00:57:01,042
The finals are around the corner.

729
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,546
I personally asked the top tutor for this.

730
00:57:05,964 --> 00:57:08,216
You should make your father happy
by getting into SNU.

731
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:13,763
SAMPLE QUESTIONS

732
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:39,122
Was she snooping around?

733
00:58:04,355 --> 00:58:06,483
Is this Taeyong's biological mother?

734
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:21,539
Juhee?

735
00:58:21,998 --> 00:58:25,001
Does Hwang Taeyong
have feelings for Juhee?

736
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:45,146
What a strange family.

737
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:47,440
A terrifying father

738
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,859
and a mysterious stepmother.

739
00:58:58,159 --> 00:59:00,119
And why are the ceilings so damn high?

740
00:59:02,413 --> 00:59:04,999
I miss my mom.

741
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:07,502
I wonder how they're all doing.

742
00:59:08,753 --> 00:59:11,047
Mom, why would you return these?

743
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,882
It's a token of his apology.

744
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,720
-Hey.
-Let's just accept them.

745
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:22,225
We can do that.
Seungcheon's been through so much.

746
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,851
All the more reason why we shouldn't.

747
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,812
Especially not from him.

748
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:28,982
She's right. We're not so poor
that we should accept those.

749
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,818
And he got all of you gifts except for me.

750
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,778
He's not really apologetic.

751
00:59:34,696 --> 00:59:35,530
I won't allow this.

752
00:59:38,366 --> 00:59:41,995
Dad, say something.

753
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:44,581
Do we really need to return these?

754
00:59:44,664 --> 00:59:46,124
Look at this.

755
00:59:48,209 --> 00:59:49,877
I'll buy you one next time.

756
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,548
Forget it!

757
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:04,100
Let me see.

758
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:07,729
Jeez, he has terrible taste.

759
01:00:10,481 --> 01:00:11,774
I'm going to school.

760
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:13,484
Bye.

761
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:35,715
Seungcheon! Wait!

762
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,301
Hey.

763
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:42,013
Hey, look.

764
01:00:43,222 --> 01:00:44,724
You haven't been to school in a while.

765
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:47,685
So have something good with your friends.

766
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,647
Is this your nest egg, Father?

767
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,939
Does Mom know about this?

768
01:00:52,023 --> 01:00:54,192
"Father?" You little…

769
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:57,987
Why have you been calling me that lately?
It's hurting my feelings.

770
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:00,573
I'm not sure.

771
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,910
Dad, is this it?

772
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:06,371
What can I get for 20,000 won?

773
01:01:07,955 --> 01:01:09,207
Still, thank you.

774
01:01:11,250 --> 01:01:12,251
Seungcheon.

775
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:15,296
I'm

776
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:17,090
sorry.

777
01:01:18,216 --> 01:01:21,594
I see. You're sorry
that this is all you can give me?

778
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:24,639
Then you can give me more next time.

779
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,265
Bye, Dad.

780
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:31,646
I'm sorry…

781
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,359
that I'm an incompetent dad

782
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:39,821
who can't make much money.

783
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,783
I'm truly sorry.

784
01:01:57,547 --> 01:02:00,425
CONSTRUCTION WORKFORCE RECRUITMENT

785
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:16,482
CASHIER'S CHECK
100 MILLION WON

786
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,507
You must've been surprised
that I wanted to see you.

787
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:43,593
It's okay. I wanted to see you as well.

788
01:02:44,802 --> 01:02:48,556
Right. This will be enough
to pay off your debt.

789
01:02:50,975 --> 01:02:53,978
How did you know that we had debt?

790
01:02:54,812 --> 01:02:57,482
It was just a guess.

791
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,193
I hope you accept it.

792
01:03:01,694 --> 01:03:03,112
I can't accept this.

793
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,948
And I know why

794
01:03:06,532 --> 01:03:09,744
you're trying to compensate us
with all these gifts.

795
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,289
It's because Seungcheon is innocent.

796
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,832
You were the one who lied.

797
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:17,585
I don't want you to do this again.

798
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,923
That's all I wanted to tell you.

799
01:03:25,134 --> 01:03:26,302
Can't you just accept them?

800
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:29,013
I bought them because
I thought they would suit you.

801
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:30,681
I thought you'd look nice in them.

802
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:34,101
Also, I know you need money.
Why can't you just take it?

803
01:03:36,854 --> 01:03:39,148
You're just unbelievable, aren't you?

804
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:42,819
Do you think saying that

805
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,321
will make us forgive you?

806
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,618
If you're truly sorry,
just let Seungcheon be.

807
01:03:50,701 --> 01:03:51,953
Just ignore him.

808
01:03:53,704 --> 01:03:55,414
That's what's best for him.

809
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:17,645
-Seungcheon!
-Where is he?

810
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,189
-Seungcheon.
-Hey, are you okay?

811
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,191
It must've been tough.

812
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:25,152
Big news. Seungcheon,
I'm sorry to tell you this.

813
01:04:25,653 --> 01:04:27,738
But we've become best friends
with Taeyong.

814
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,410
He gave us his number. Look.

815
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:34,245
BEST FRIEND TAEYONG

816
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:35,580
TAEYONG

817
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:36,789
He did?

818
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,416
BEST FRIEND TAEYONG

819
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:40,710
He's so easy.

820
01:04:42,336 --> 01:04:44,046
I don't give my number to just anyone.

821
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,465
-What?
-What?

822
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:53,180
Hwang Taeyong.

823
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,932
You made a mistake.

824
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,935
You expected us to be
grateful for those gifts?

825
01:04:58,603 --> 01:05:00,605
And that yellow bag you got for my mom

826
01:05:01,272 --> 01:05:02,440
looked really cheap.

827
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,110
Jeez.

828
01:05:07,278 --> 01:05:09,655
Has he gone insane?

829
01:05:11,240 --> 01:05:13,034
Lee Seungcheon has gone crazy.

830
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:16,954
He's the cheap one.

831
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:18,414
Whoa.

832
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,544
So what if he has money?

833
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:27,506
Jeez.

834
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,633
Seungcheon!

835
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:38,392
Na Juhee?

836
01:05:41,437 --> 01:05:43,314
So you transferred to this school.

837
01:05:43,397 --> 01:05:46,609
Don't worry about the convenience store.
The boss said you should rest up.

838
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:48,402
Convenience store?

839
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:50,529
What do you mean?

840
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,157
We worked there together.

841
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:56,535
We worked at a convenience store together?

842
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:58,287
Seungcheon?

843
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:02,708
Seungcheon.

844
01:06:04,126 --> 01:06:06,128
Your name is Lee Seungcheon, right?

845
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,423
What's on your mind?

846
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:18,891
Right. The convenience store.

847
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:22,061
Yes, that's where we first met.

848
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,898
Are you really okay?
Shouldn't you go see a doctor?

849
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,529
It's okay. I just have a headache.

850
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:35,366
-Na Juhee?
-Yeah?

851
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:37,994
Are we dating?

852
01:06:38,744 --> 01:06:39,620
What?

853
01:06:45,251 --> 01:06:46,335
It just felt like

854
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,089
you and I are close.

855
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,885
I didn't ask you out, did I?

856
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:58,931
No, you didn't.

857
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,350
What a relief.

858
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,770
I never ask a girl out first.

859
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:11,444
I wasn't sure because I couldn't remember.
But I knew it.

860
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,655
Hey, new kid.

861
01:07:15,906 --> 01:07:17,199
What a nice couple.

862
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:18,951
You guys look good together.

863
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:20,953
What is this?

864
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:22,830
You guys dating?

865
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:24,165
I'm sorry for interrupting.

866
01:07:24,915 --> 01:07:28,294
But I need to speak with Underdog.

867
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:29,920
Let's go.

868
01:07:30,713 --> 01:07:32,006
You're dead meat.

869
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,135
I doubt they're seeing each other.

870
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:38,262
What's going on?

871
01:07:45,186 --> 01:07:46,854
Will he be all right?

872
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:56,030
How strange. Why are you
always worried about Seungcheon?

873
01:07:56,113 --> 01:07:57,114
You're engaged.

874
01:07:57,698 --> 01:07:59,408
How did you know?

875
01:07:59,492 --> 01:08:01,786
I'll keep it a secret, so don't worry.

876
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:05,247
Juhee, we're going to study
for the finals today. Do you want to come?

877
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:06,332
I'll let you in.

878
01:08:06,415 --> 01:08:07,917
I'm sorry.

879
01:08:09,043 --> 01:08:12,046
But I have plans with a friend
I haven't seen in a while.

880
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:24,308
How shoddy.

881
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:28,729
Why are you looking around?

882
01:08:28,813 --> 01:08:30,523
It's not your first time at my house.

883
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:32,566
Is this a two-fish ceramic?

884
01:08:36,278 --> 01:08:37,863
It's a fake.

885
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:41,909
Why does your father have
such cheap taste?

886
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:48,332
Park Janggun, I'm busy
so just cut to the chase.

887
01:08:50,042 --> 01:08:51,377
That little bastard.

888
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:54,505
Darn it.

889
01:08:57,049 --> 01:08:58,843
You tattled on me for cheating,
didn't you?

890
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:02,179
What do you mean?

891
01:09:02,263 --> 01:09:03,180
Park Janggun,

892
01:09:03,931 --> 01:09:06,851
what is this attitude you're giving me?

893
01:09:07,685 --> 01:09:10,271
Did you bring me
all the way here just to ask me that?

894
01:09:10,479 --> 01:09:14,441
Well, I just…

895
01:09:15,484 --> 01:09:18,279
Forget it. You don't know
how to treat your guest.

896
01:09:18,863 --> 01:09:20,489
Kim Yunsu, at least get me some water.

897
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:24,076
-What? Isn't your surname, "Jeong?"
-Drop it.

898
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:27,663
So?

899
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:30,082
I'm just saying.

900
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,418
Do you want water? Coke?

901
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:33,586
Hey!

902
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:36,005
What are you doing?

903
01:09:36,589 --> 01:09:38,257
That's Lee Seungcheon.

904
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:40,217
Why are you intimidated
as if he's Hwang Taeyong?

905
01:09:40,301 --> 01:09:42,428
Exactly. Why are you so intimidated?

906
01:09:42,511 --> 01:09:43,554
I wasn't.

907
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:46,599
-Stop accusing me every time.
-That's enough.

908
01:09:48,851 --> 01:09:52,146
I'm going home first. Have fun.

909
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,734
Where do you think you're going?

910
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,153
Hey, come here.

911
01:10:03,032 --> 01:10:04,241
I was scared for a second.

912
01:10:04,325 --> 01:10:06,535
-You little…
-Hey, move. Seungcheon.

913
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,495
You've grown so much.

914
01:10:08,579 --> 01:10:11,582
Move. Get up.

915
01:10:11,999 --> 01:10:14,210
I told you to get up!

916
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:15,502
Hey.

917
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:16,503
Whoo!

918
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:19,381
-Film him.
-Here I go.

919
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:22,676
-Hey, lift your head up.
-You scared me for a second.

920
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:23,802
Lift your head.

921
01:10:24,553 --> 01:10:28,015
-Seungcheon, it's been a while, right?
-Do you want to die?

922
01:10:28,682 --> 01:10:30,559
-Remember this?
-Janggun's angry.

923
01:10:30,643 --> 01:10:32,603
I know you do. Right?

924
01:10:32,686 --> 01:10:34,772
-Nice.
-That's good. Look at his face.

925
01:10:34,855 --> 01:10:36,106
That's good.

926
01:10:36,357 --> 01:10:37,650
Seungcheon.

927
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:41,654
I'm really going to kill you today.

928
01:10:43,822 --> 01:10:44,865
Farewell, Lee Seungcheon.

929
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,662
He looked totally scared.

930
01:10:49,745 --> 01:10:52,206
Hey, get that away from me.

931
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:54,541
I did as you told me to, sir.

932
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:55,960
But are you sure about this?

933
01:10:56,043 --> 01:10:58,420
Taeyong is your one and only child.

934
01:10:58,504 --> 01:11:01,340
It's okay. Just do as I say.

935
01:11:05,678 --> 01:11:07,972
What about President Na's son's business?

936
01:11:08,222 --> 01:11:10,266
We decided to invest in it as you ordered.

937
01:11:12,226 --> 01:11:14,353
But the profitability ratio
isn't that great.

938
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,647
That's fine, it's money I had to spend.

939
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,232
PROFITABILITY REPORT
PORTFOLIO NAME: ANSONG CORPORATION

940
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:21,110
So I guess Na Juhee
is worth two trillion won.

941
01:11:25,155 --> 01:11:26,115
Nara.

942
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:29,660
It's been too long, hasn't it?

943
01:11:29,743 --> 01:11:30,744
JUNG NARA

944
01:11:30,828 --> 01:11:31,662
I'm sorry.

945
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:35,666
I'll visit more often.

946
01:11:59,690 --> 01:12:02,318
PARK JINSEOK

947
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:07,114
How have you been?

948
01:12:08,157 --> 01:12:10,784
Jinseok, I'm no longer Lee Seungcheon.

949
01:12:17,416 --> 01:12:18,667
I'm Hwang Taeyong.

950
01:12:18,751 --> 01:12:21,587
You might be upset with me,
but I don't regret it.

951
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,467
Say something instead of just smiling.

952
01:12:30,054 --> 01:12:31,889
LEE DONGKYUNG

953
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:36,185
Hey, Dongkyung.

954
01:12:40,105 --> 01:12:41,690
Seungcheon is missing.

955
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:45,110
Janggun and his friends took him,
but I don't know where.

956
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,533
Let me show you something fun.

957
01:12:52,493 --> 01:12:55,079
One, two, three!

958
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:02,961
Munki, take me to Park Janggun's house.

959
01:13:06,924 --> 01:13:08,008
Do you know

960
01:13:09,301 --> 01:13:10,302
how much

961
01:13:11,136 --> 01:13:14,973
my dad beat me thanks to you?

962
01:13:15,307 --> 01:13:17,101
Get up. We've just begun.

963
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,977
-He's taking it like a champ.
-Get up.

964
01:13:20,437 --> 01:13:22,564
Hey, clench your teeth.

965
01:13:28,278 --> 01:13:30,197
Hey, I thought your parents
were out today.

966
01:13:30,823 --> 01:13:32,491
It's just delivery.

967
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,868
-I almost got a heart attack.
-Move.

968
01:13:42,459 --> 01:13:43,460
What?

969
01:13:44,670 --> 01:13:46,839
Hwang Taeyong?

970
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:56,014
Taeyong, what brings you here?

971
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,350
Dongkyung told me

972
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,936
that you were having fun with Seungcheon.

973
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,494
I wanted to join in on the fun.

974
01:14:20,831 --> 01:14:25,711
Come to think of it,
this is your first time at my house.

975
01:14:26,211 --> 01:14:29,256
-Right?
-That's right. Welcome.

976
01:14:29,339 --> 01:14:31,508
I'm honored.
Do you want something to drink?

977
01:14:32,259 --> 01:14:34,761
Right. This is my first time here.

978
01:14:35,888 --> 01:14:37,306
Gosh.

979
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:41,268
-Your house is nice.
-Mm-hmm.

980
01:14:41,894 --> 01:14:43,604
You even have guns.

981
01:14:44,313 --> 01:14:46,857
That's a real gun. Be careful.

982
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:49,860
Why are you scared?
Your father never keeps them loaded.

983
01:14:49,943 --> 01:14:51,904
That's true, but…

984
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:56,074
Hwang Taeyong, how did you know that?

985
01:14:58,494 --> 01:14:59,495
You're curious about that?

986
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,623
Aren't you curious about why I'm here?

987
01:15:06,710 --> 01:15:08,253
Lee Seungcheon, get up.

988
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,638
Don't tell me you're here to help him.

989
01:15:18,514 --> 01:15:20,182
I thought you came

990
01:15:21,683 --> 01:15:23,519
to reconcile with me.

991
01:15:24,603 --> 01:15:25,938
Reconcile?

992
01:15:26,021 --> 01:15:27,898
We never fought in the first place.

993
01:15:28,899 --> 01:15:29,983
All I did

994
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:34,321
was warn a rat about its proper place.

995
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:35,322
Taeyong,

996
01:15:35,989 --> 01:15:39,326
what's going on with you?

997
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:41,662
Hwang Taeyong.

998
01:15:42,871 --> 01:15:46,041
Lee Seungcheon has always been our toy.

999
01:15:46,124 --> 01:15:47,668
He's not worth your concern.

1000
01:15:47,751 --> 01:15:48,585
A toy?

1001
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:50,921
In that case,

1002
01:15:52,589 --> 01:15:54,132
-kill him.
-What?

1003
01:15:58,178 --> 01:15:59,263
Taeyong.

1004
01:16:01,265 --> 01:16:03,725
-Hey, that's…
-I never liked him.

1005
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:07,479
-Let's just kill him off.
-Hey!

1006
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,897
-That's not right.
-Why not?

1007
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,191
You don't want anyone
dying under your roof?

1008
01:16:11,275 --> 01:16:12,401
Your dad can't handle that?

1009
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:14,111
Taeyong, what's wrong with you?

1010
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:17,531
Why did you torture him so much
if you couldn't handle the outcome?

1011
01:16:18,115 --> 01:16:20,117
In that case, you should pay.

1012
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:21,660
Taeyong!

1013
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:23,912
Spare me. I won't do it anymore.

1014
01:16:23,996 --> 01:16:26,456
Just this once. I won't do it anymore!

1015
01:16:27,249 --> 01:16:28,458
Just this once.

1016
01:16:29,543 --> 01:16:30,586
Should I spare you?

1017
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:37,759
But that would be no fun.

1018
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:40,137
Janggun.

1019
01:16:41,179 --> 01:16:42,139
I'm not like you.

1020
01:16:46,643 --> 01:16:47,811
I'm Hwang Taeyong.

1021
01:16:47,894 --> 01:16:50,355
Hwang Taeyong, please…

1022
01:17:01,575 --> 01:17:04,661
SPECIAL THANKS TO SHIN JOO HYUP
FOR HIS GUEST APPEARANCE

1023
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,942
Hwang Taeyong and Lee Seungcheon
have the same birthday.

1024
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,235
Isn't that interesting?

1025
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,154
Please let me inherit Doshin.

1026
01:17:39,237 --> 01:17:41,323
Do you finally remember that incident?

1027
01:17:42,824 --> 01:17:44,493
Who are you?

1028
01:17:45,202 --> 01:17:46,662
Why are you going this far?

1029
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,997
Is it a trend to carry one of these?

1030
01:17:49,081 --> 01:17:50,916
How much would it cost

1031
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:52,584
for a child to abandon his parents?

1032
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,045
He'd do anything for money.

1033
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:58,965
You must want to use
the golden spoon again.
