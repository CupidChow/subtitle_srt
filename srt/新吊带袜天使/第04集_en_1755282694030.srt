We're the baddest, no fear

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Let the ghosts appear

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Life alone, baby, we take in the mirror

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Panty, stocky, panty, stocky

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Break this system

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I don't know.

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
The famous handsome president is famous.

26
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Not only handsome,

27
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
he was born in a remote village and graduated from a law school while working.

28
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
He picked up a dog that fell into the river and welcomed it as a family.

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
His hobbies are jogging, his favorite food is salad and chicken.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
He has a model girlfriend, but he's still protecting his brother until he gets married.

31
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
He's a handsome, hard-working president!

32
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Anyway, in order to save Panty, we have to change the law.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
It's impossible to change such a law.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
What?

35
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,000
We can change it!

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,000
That's right!

37
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Next week, everyone has a presidential election!

38
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Everyone's presidential election?

39
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,000
That's right!

40
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
If we're a living being living in this town, we can all be elected!

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
If we all become the president of the entire life-saving city,

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
If we all become the president of the entire life-saving city,

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
We can become the president and change the law in seconds!

44
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Wait, Panty!

45
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,000
I can't be the president after I become the president!

46
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I'm the only one who has a gum-like impression that sticks to the street.

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
I can't beat that kind of personality and a refreshing handsome brother-in-law!

48
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
If it's Chanty and Nizox,

49
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I can't be the president because I'm popular at school!

50
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
There's no way I can get votes for a demon from the underworld!

51
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
If it's Gartan, I'm a priest, so I can't be the president!

52
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I was on the verge of being a church's donation the other day,

53
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
and I don't think I'll win if I get caught on the internet.

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
If it's Stocking, I'll be the president!

55
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Angels have good looks, and good brains.

56
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
But they have bad personalities.

57
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
But they can't be a part of their personalities.

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,000
They can be a pet, a kitten,

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
but they can also get votes for a cat.

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
They can also get votes for a geek who's good at talking.

61
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
They can get votes for all kinds of niche organizations.

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Angels! Anyway, they're all possible angels!

63
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Angel!

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Stocking! You're the next president!

65
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Huh?

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
The day I become president,

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I promise to give everyone freedom of sex and violence,

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
and sweets for free!

69
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I promise!

70
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They've got too many niche organizations.

71
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I have a good idea.

72
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Left, right, left, right, right, left.

73
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Hi, you're the president.

74
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Are you voting for me?

75
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
If you're going to die,

76
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,000
why don't you resign from your position as president?

77
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
No, Stocking!

78
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
It's okay.

79
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
This is a development weapon, so it won't work on humans.

80
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
But it's dangerous if someone sees us!

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Oh.

82
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
It's in.

83
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
It's working!

84
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
What?

85
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Didn't it work on humans?

86
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
So you're a ghost?

87
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I can't help it if you find out.

88
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm the first president of the business of ghost-inventing!

89
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What do you mean?

90
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Business?

91
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
So you're a comrade?

92
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm a comrade in business.

93
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
I have 40 to 50 business partners.

94
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Of course, I'm doing a lot of business.

95
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
So you're working in the neighborhood and graduating from law school?

96
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Business closer!

97
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Everyone loves that kind of heartwarming story!

98
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
That dog!

99
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
The one who drowned in the river!

100
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm a businessman!

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,000
By the way, he's a businessman who does business and does dog-shaming!

102
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
What?

103
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Is that true?

104
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
It's all business.

105
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What business?

106
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
What kind of a liar are you?

107
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
In this day and age,

108
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
if you're not a business spirit soldier,

109
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
you can't sit on the chair of the president.

110
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
I'll get everything in business!

111
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'm the business president!

112
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You're a ghost who drowned in power!

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Then we should talk quickly.

114
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'm a spirit born from the dark, lost in the middle of the world!

115
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Beauty!

116
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Good, President!

117
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Our rival is gone!

118
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I'm sure we'll win the stocking!

119
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
The stocking is down by four votes.

120
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Sunuka!

121
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
So...

122
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You failed the exam because you didn't get to be the vice president.

123
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
What?

124
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I'm sorry.

125
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
What? I'm sorry, Sunuka!

126
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're not going to leave it to the anti-psycho.

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
You!

128
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Can't you just hand over the wire?

129
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
That poor church doesn't have that kind of money.

130
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're right.

131
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You guys don't have to show off!

132
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Take it easy!

133
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
Hey, I'm busy right now.

134
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Huh?

135
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Should I give it to you?

136
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,000
What?

137
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Huh?

138
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
The new president is going to the party?

139
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Yeah!

140
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Yeah!

141
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:44,000
It's a sign of God that the new president will be awarded a prize.

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Good for you, Panty.

143
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
I'm a little nervous.

144
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,000
So, who's the new president?

145
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Huh?

146
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
TETT CEMETARY HILLS

147
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
I mean, while I'm chasing ghosts,

148
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,000
it's impossible for me to have a car sex and get wrecked.

149
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
It's impossible.

150
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It's late at night, so I'm working on the see-through and the rejection of the pull.

151
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I'm working, you fucking party cow!

152
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Hey, isn't that a grave?

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Huh?

154
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It's weird to be in a place like that.

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
I don't know even if I get punished.

156
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Shut up, occult woman.

157
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Don't do that!

158
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,000
So cute!

159
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
What's wrong, Panty?

160
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,000
This... this... this... this... this cat...

161
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm so hungry when I wake up.

162
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you want to eat? Do you want to eat?

163
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Sister, this cat looks like a ghost.

164
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Meow.

165
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I'll eat you again!

166
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Dabun!

167
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Hey, Panty, are you crazy?

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Demon!

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You're so cute.

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What's wrong with you guys?

171
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Ghosts are ghosts, right?

172
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Just kill them.

173
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
There's no point in doing that.

174
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Last night, someone did a terrible act of destroying the cat's grave.

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,000
This ghost was born from the hatred of the cat that was released after seeing it.

176
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
But it's still small.

177
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,000
It's not even half a heaven coin.

178
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Then let's just kill it.

179
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Then let's buy it at home.

180
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I agree.

181
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Can I buy it?

182
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I'll take care of it.

183
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
It's small, so it's half a coin.

184
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Then if we make it bigger,

185
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
we'll get a lot of heaven coins at once.

186
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
I'll give you a name.

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
This girl is a girl, so it's called Eve.

188
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Vive!

189
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Your name is Vive because you're shaking all the time.

190
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Oh, the health charge is all gone.

191
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I'll give you an extra charge.

192
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Vive!

193
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Let's play with Stalking Sister.

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Oh, the ghost cat's scratch is gone.

195
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Other toys too.

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
We can't play with Vive with this.

197
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Good, good.

198
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Good girl, Vive.

199
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Eat a lot and get bigger.

200
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
If it gets this big,

201
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
what's the big deal with 10 heaven coins?

202
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Oh, right.

203
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I was going to do a Twister hack with a handsome guy today.

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Oh, Vive.

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
When did you stop shaking?

206
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I found it.

207
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
I'll get you a ghost cat when you get home.

208
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You're a good girl.

209
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
He's not here.

210
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I'm home.

211
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Funti, where have you been?

212
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
He's not here.

213
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Who?

214
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Vive!

215
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Vive!

216
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
The time has come.

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Why?

218
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
The ghost that was abandoned by people and didn't know how to be loved

219
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
has been loved by you.

220
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
You don't have anything left to think about in this world anymore.

221
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
No way.

222
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Funti.

223
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I was going to make it bigger

224
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
and earn more heaven coins.

225
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Vive.

226
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm home.

227
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Hey, Funti. Hurry up.

228
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to sleep.

229
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
The next one is coming.

230
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Don't go.

231
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Funti and the ghost cat.

232
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Shut up.

233
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Shut up.

234
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Okay, okay.

235
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm coming.

236
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
The next one is coming.

237
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
The next one is coming.

238
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
The next one is coming.

239
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
What?

240
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,000
What?

241
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
What?

242
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
What?

243
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
What?

244
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
What?

245
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
What?

246
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
What did you say?

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
The person who touched the dot

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
is now in a strange state.

249
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
What is that?

250
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,000
Where did it go?

251
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
I don't know.

252
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
What is this?

253
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
Kata, isn't this the ghost's doing?

254
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Is this the news?

255
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,000
What? News?

256
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
What is this?

257
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Be clear.

258
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
I hope so.

259
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,000
But it may not be.

260
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
You're so big that you're so fluffy.

261
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,000
I'll see if I go.

262
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
What are you guys running away from?

263
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Let's try to touch the line.

264
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Look.

265
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
Everyone is like this.

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What is this?

267
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
It's Sunday.

268
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
The T-Boy is being attacked.

269
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,000
What are you guys?

270
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Are you trying to get in my way?

271
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Don't do that.

272
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
I wonder if I've done something so wrong.

273
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Come on.

274
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
What is this?

275
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
What is this?

276
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
What is this?

277
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
What is this?

278
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,000
It's so funny.

279
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,000
What is this?

280
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Watch out, Patty!

281
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
What the fuck?

282
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
What is this?

283
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
It's a bean.

284
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
What is this?

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:33,000
It's a beard.

286
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,000
A beard.

287
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,000
A beard.

288
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I don't like it.

289
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
It's a beard.

290
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Beard.

291
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Oh, God.

292
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,500
The beard.

293
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:53,340
Isn't this

294
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,000
a beard?

295
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
A beard.

296
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm not going to be useful for you.

297
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Where did he go?

298
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Over there!

299
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,000
He's shooting a beam over there!

300
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
All right, we're done.

301
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Now, we have to move on.

302
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Wait!

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,000
No!

304
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,000
You guys are the ones who have to wait.

305
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
There's more weirdos!

306
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
My name is Begotcha.

307
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
You guys are Ghost Hound.

308
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Go!

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
We did it!

310
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Wait!

311
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Damn it!

312
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
At this rate...

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Begotcha, be careful!

314
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
There's a vacuum in the earth.

315
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
If he falls, it'll be a big deal.

316
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
I know!

317
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I'm sure of it!

318
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Be careful, Begotcha!

319
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
What?

320
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,000
What the hell is that?

321
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What a weirdo!

322
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,000
I'm going to kill him!

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm going to kill him!

324
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
What a weirdo!

325
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He's a villain!

326
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,000
But I won't let you go.

327
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm a nurse.

328
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,000
I've realized it.

329
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
What is this place?

330
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
It's Daten City.

331
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Daten City?

332
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
I don't know.

333
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Wait.

334
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:14,000
I don't even know my own name!

335
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Where are you going?

336
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm screwed.

337
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
I can't get my hands out of the beam.

338
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

339
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Party!

340
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
Sorry I'm late.

341
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Are you done laughing?

342
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
I have something to ask you.

343
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,000
Look at his forehead.

344
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,000
There's something like a black cube.

345
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,000
There is!

346
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
Doesn't it look like a part of Ghost?

347
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Wani Wani.

348
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
That's right.

349
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I see.

350
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I'll go and talk to him.

351
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll try to break it.

352
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
You understand?

353
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
I understand.

354
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
Wait.

355
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
He's probably a son of a farm.

356
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
He has a cow's face.

357
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
He'll get angry if I talk to him.

358
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Okay.

359
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
I'm sorry.

360
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Hey, you!

361
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
A cow ran away from you.

362
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
It ate my house.

363
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,000
If it's a cow, it's a dog.

364
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
It's a dog.

365
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:20,000
It's probably eating other people's profit.

366
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
If you're upset, come here.

367
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What are you talking about?

368
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I won't forgive you.

369
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'll get out of here.

370
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Okay, now.

371
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Party!

372
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Wani!

373
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Wani!

374
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Oh, my God.

375
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
What am I?

376
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
You were controlled by Ghost.

377
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
But it's strange.

378
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I defeated him, but I didn't get any money.

379
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
I can't get back to normal.

380
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Are you okay?

381
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm still in a bad mood.

382
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
What?

383
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What's wrong, Party?

384
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
I think you've changed a little.

385
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,000
You don't have to worry about it.

386
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You're doing better than usual.

387
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
That's right.

388
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,000
Ghosts do good things sometimes.

389
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,000
Wani Wani.

390
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
What's going on?

391
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
What's wrong with you?

392
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
I remembered.

393
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,000
My name is Baywatch.

394
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,000
And my mission is...

395
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Make it in time!

396
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Oh, do something, Party.

397
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
It's true.

398
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Wait.

399
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I'm not your enemy.

400
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,000
The enemy is over there.

401
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,000
Baywatch!

402
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,000
Wani!

403
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
The enemy is over there.

404
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Baywatch!

405
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
The old man's house is...

406
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Oh, my God.

407
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
What am I?

408
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I have to go back to the Crab King in Beiling.

409
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
What do you mean?

410
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
My name is Baywatch.

411
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I'm a ghost hunter.

412
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm a space ghost hunter.

413
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,000
But I don't care.

414
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
I have to destroy it right now.

415
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
This universe is in danger.

416
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
What?

417
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Cosmic Monolith Cube Mother Space Ghost.

418
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
It's a ghost that was born by the grudge of the four-dimensional people

419
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,000
that was destroyed by the anti-seismic equation.

420
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:25,000
It will distort space and space-time and turn everything into nougatism.

421
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,000
What happens if you turn everything into nougatism?

422
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
All living things are called the source of life.

423
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
It will disappear.

424
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
It's hard.

425
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
I haven't had sex or sex since yesterday.

426
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
I've given up my life for the sake of the universe.

427
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,000
Wani!

428
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
But this is clearly abnormal.

429
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
The reason why it's getting stronger is because it's in this world.

430
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
By the way, there's no end to angels, buddy.

431
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
What?

432
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
You're so stupid.

433
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,000
You don't have one.

434
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,000
What?

435
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
It's our devil's tail.

436
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Wani!

437
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
What?

438
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
There's no mistake.

439
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
I took the source of your power and powered it up.

440
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
There's no way to go back.

441
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If we don't destroy the Cube Ghost,

442
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
the whole world will collapse.

443
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,000
Baywatch!

444
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Wow!

445
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Let's go, everyone!

446
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Even if we're out of lives, we'll save this world.

447
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
The Ghost is already at the tip of its nose.

448
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Be careful not to get it.

449
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
Help me!

450
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Help me!

451
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Wani!

452
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
No, if we don't do this...

453
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
We're going to lose!

454
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
What are you going to do, Baywatch?

455
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
If we don't do this...

456
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Baywatch...

457
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,000
What on earth are you going to do?

458
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm responsible for everything that happened.

459
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'm the one who hit the meteorite and let the Ghost escape.

460
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I, Tsuguna, will return your power even if I have to die.

461
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Baywatch!

462
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,000
No!

463
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Baywatch!

464
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Please, everyone!

465
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,000
That was really bad.

466
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
I'm sorry again.

467
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
But that cool guy was funny.

468
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
You're annoying.

469
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,000
You're annoying.

470
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,000
Please wait, everyone.

471
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
We still don't have money.

472
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Money?

473
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Huh?

474
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Huh?

475
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Huh?

476
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,000
Huh?

477
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Huh?

478
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,000
What's going on?

479
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Huh?

480
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Huh?

481
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Huh?

482
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm back.

483
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Listen, Panjin.

484
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
This world is no longer safe.

485
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,000
Everything has been destroyed.

486
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,000
The future and eternity are as they are.

487
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
But!

488
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,000
I can change the past.

489
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,000
I'll give you the power to transcend time and space.

490
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,000
The bullet that shot me will transcend time and space.

491
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
The past will also rise.

492
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Before I come to this earth, I will destroy the past.

493
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:27,000
I will destroy the past.

494
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I will destroy the past.

495
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,000
I will destroy the past.

496
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:35,000
Before I come to this earth, I will transcend time and space.

497
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,000
I will destroy the past.

498
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
Wait!

499
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,000
What is that?

500
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
It's a cow!

501
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,000
It's a cow and its owner are mixed!

502
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,000
It's not over yet, is it?

503
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,000
You guys...

504
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
I see.

505
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
The future...

506
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
The old Ghost that I destroyed...

507
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
That's not the main body.

508
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,000
The main body of the Ghost is that black dot.

509
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
It's the reflection-willing formula itself.

510
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,000
Isn't that right?

511
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,000
That's right.

512
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:33,000
We Space Ghost Hunters are going to destroy it.

513
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
I will destroy it.

514
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,000
But you...

515
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,000
You understand, right?

516
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Certainly, this world is my past.

517
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:47,000
But the future of this world is not my future.

518
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Then at least...

519
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,000
That's not it.

520
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Your future is yours.

521
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
That's right.

522
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Let's go!

523
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,000
What are you doing, Bounty?

524
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,000
Hey, are you listening?

525
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,000
Hey!

526
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
I'm sorry.

527
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I'm sorry.

528
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I'm sorry.

529
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,000
I'm sorry.

530
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:09,000
I'm sorry.

531
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
I'm sorry.

532
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I'm sorry.

533
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
I'm sorry.

534
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,000
I'm sorry.

535
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm sorry.

536
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:21,000
I'm sorry.

537
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,000
I'm sorry.

538
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,000
I'm sorry.

539
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,000
I'm sorry.

540
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,000
I'm sorry.

541
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,000
I'm sorry.

542
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,000
I'm sorry.

543
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,000
I'm sorry.

544
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:37,000
I'm sorry.

545
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I'm sorry.

546
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
I'm sorry.

547
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I'm sorry.

548
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
I'm sorry.

549
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,000
I'm sorry.

550
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,000
I'm sorry.

551
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
I'm sorry.

552
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
I'm sorry.

553
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,000
I'm sorry.

554
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:57,000
I'm sorry.

555
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
