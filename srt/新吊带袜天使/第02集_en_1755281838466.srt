1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
P-A-N-T-Y-S-T-O-C-K-I-N-G.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
P-A-N-T-Y-S-T-O-C-K-I-N-G.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
P-A-N-T-Y-S-T-O-C-K-I-N-G.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
P-A-N-T-Y-S-T-O-C-K-I-N-G.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Where the battle's no fear, let the foes appear.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Life alone, baby, we take in the mirror.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Panty, stocky, panty, stocky.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Break this, this, simmer, power extreme.

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
P-A-N-T-Y-S-T-O-C-K-I-N-G.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Panty and stocky.

11
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
It's the Girls For Life!

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,000
The city of the gap between gods and demons, Daten City.

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:49,000
The humans have been threatened with the terrible evil spirits.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
The darkness that lies in the gaps in the hearts of humans,

15
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
today, unknowingly, is invading this city.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,220
The evil spirits that are the souls of the people of the

17
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:04,000
greedy, the people of the evil spirits,

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
are being destroyed by the light of the human mind.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,000
Is it the use of the gods, or the use of the demons,

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,000
that has been entrusted with the mission of clearing this darkness?

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Is it both?

22
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,000
What's going on?

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Good morning, Panty.

24
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Good morning.

25
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Good morning.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Good morning, Stocky.

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,000
Thank you, the gods, for the gift of your blessing.

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Here it is.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Don't you need this?

30
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
You're tired of it.

31
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
What's this? It's only half.

32
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I don't understand.

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,000
Hmm.

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Isn't this the dead body from before?

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
What's water and oil?

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Thank you, Kaledo. It's a blessing.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Why are the demons here?

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I forgot.

39
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Good morning, Scanty.

40
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:37,560
Humiliation is a

41
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,000
rule that we don't put on the table.

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Good morning, Misox.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Our pride is to build an even relationship by

44
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
perfectly managing housekeeping,

45
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
regardless of the grudge in the low-level.

46
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We are the demons of the Highglass House Maiden.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
So you're the Isouro.

48
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
Isouro?

49
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I won't let you put the tabakas on the sofa.

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I won't let you do anything that's not appropriate.

51
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Listen, you bitches!

52
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Our mission is to defeat the ghosts and protect the peace on Earth.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,000
The peace system is different from ours.

54
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Actually, it was directly from the Demon King the other day.

55
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
The Demon King?

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
From my father?

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Apparently, he wants to stop the human resources of the ghosts

58
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
who have been on the ground since the release of the Health Gate.

59
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Increasing and decreasing the number of demons is a problem.

60
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Since then, the defense of the underworld has been downgraded.

61
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,000
This is a serious problem that concerns the defense of the country.

62
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
So you demons are responsible for this.

63
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:39,000
You are forbidden to enter the underworld until you return the ghosts who have been on the ground.

64
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You were asked to enter this church by the Demon King,

65
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
who is in charge of the land.

66
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
What the hell are we supposed to do?

67
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,000
We can't do it.

68
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Let's just say we're the concept.

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
You're a demon.

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Shut up, you bastards!

71
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Your mission is not to collect man, sweets, or condoms.

72
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You have to collect these coins.

73
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Wow, there's a lot of them.

74
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
We can change the world right now if we have this much.

75
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
By the way,

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,000
the price of the Hemp Coin of the previous conflict-influenced market

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,000
has been greatly reduced.

78
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Seriously?

79
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Here.

80
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
At this rate, you angels will never return to the world.

81
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Who will?

82
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The distant future!

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Poor you.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You are the same.

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Demon King,

86
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
there are things that can turn the underworld into a Hemp Coin.

87
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
There are, but...

88
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Go away, demons!

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,000
You will also defeat the ghosts and stop the Hemp Coin.

90
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
If you stop this case,

91
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
the time for the underworld will be allowed.

92
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So you're going to find the ghosts

93
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and get the coins that killed you first?

94
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
If that's the new rule,

95
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I won't let you do that.

96
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Well, let's do this.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Stalking.

98
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Panty.

99
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Nisaka-san.

100
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Onee-san.

101
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Here I go.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Yahoo!

103
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Yahoo!

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
The one who finds the ghosts first will be the one who gets the money.

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Sena, what was that?

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
A butt and an ear?

107
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Water and oil.

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
Where is that ghost?

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
I found it, Onee-sama.

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
What is that?

111
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
To find the ghosts,

112
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,000
the common sense of the underworld is to use the ghost exploration app.

113
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
That's cheating.

114
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The ghosts will turn the two-block-long weed shop to the right,

115
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
and the weed shop to the left,

116
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
and the corner weed shop to the left,

117
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,000
and the diner next to the weed shop to the left.

118
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
If you know the rules, I'll throw you out!

119
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah!

120
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Shit!

121
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Let's follow them!

122
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Go!

123
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Go!

124
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
The Ghosts

125
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Sorry to keep you waiting.

126
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Beef Cheese Pancake...

127
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
...is the best!

128
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Is there a ghost in a cold shop like this?

129
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
It smells like cheap oil.

130
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Panty, everyone!

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Hey, Geek Boy.

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What are you doing here?

133
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'm working part-time here.

134
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Did you come to play?

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
What?

136
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Are you really meeting here?

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
I just updated this morning.

138
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
The bugs should be fixed.

139
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
But I don't know who the ghost is.

140
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
It's a fucking shitty app.

141
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,000
This diner is famous for its pancakes.

142
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Here you go.

143
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I saved Panty the other day.

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
I don't need it.

145
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I don't need it.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
I'm sorry, but as a friend...

147
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
No, as a man...

148
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You're a little shit-sick, Panty.

149
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
So it's a ghost.

150
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
This reaction is human.

151
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Hey, the weapon can kill ghosts, but not humans.

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
What about your fucking weapons?

153
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
Ouch!

154
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ouch!

155
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
It's true that the weapon doesn't work on humans.

156
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
But...

157
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Humans can't kill, but fucking angels can!

158
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Huh?

159
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
We're the same.

160
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Well, then, let's shoot the guys from this store.

161
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Then you'll know that Germany is a ghost.

162
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's okay, but they're fast.

163
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
My back is fixed!

164
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Everyone's gone, but Panty's gone!

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Panty's gone!

166
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Fuck!

167
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Panty is human, not a ghost!

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I knew it!

169
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,000
It was a ghost after all!

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Big Sister and Big Angel are water and oil.

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Water and oil...

172
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
That's right.

173
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Water and oil...

174
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What's water and oil?

175
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Panty!

176
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
Oh, oil!

177
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Something's fishy.

178
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Let's see.

179
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Ouch!

180
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Oh no!

181
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Panty, what are you doing?

182
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,000
It's a good moepuri.

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
It's a good momentum.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
It's a good momentum.

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Water!

186
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Water!

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I'm scared!

188
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Welcome, big boy!

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
We need to put out the fire!

190
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Water!

191
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
No, no, no!

192
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,000
If we put water on the fire, it'll explode!

193
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
This is bad!

194
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
It's a ghost!

195
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Water and oil.

196
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I see.

197
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I knew it.

198
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
There's a ghost.

199
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Then...

200
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Wait!

201
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
That's our prey.

202
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
We're the ones who found the place.

203
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
What?

204
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm the one who noticed the kitchen was suspicious.

205
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
You bitches!

206
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Those two things are mixed up.

207
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
They're like one ghost.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
They're still fighting.

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,000
It's water and oil ghosts.

210
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:22,000
So we need to use our strength to defeat this ghost.

211
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Why?

212
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Why?

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Fuck!

214
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:30,000
We have no choice but to do it, right, Nisoku?

215
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,000
Yes, you're right.

216
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
No matter which one gets the coins, there's no turning back.

217
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,000
We're waiting for you!

218
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
We'll bring the evil back to the underworld,

219
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
with all our pride, anger, and pain.

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Eat this!

221
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Return to the darkness!

222
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Lethal Roll!

223
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
One heaven coin, one hell coin.

224
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Same here.

225
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
I'm done.

226
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
I'm done for.

227
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
You let me down,

228
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
so it's like I found a ghost.

229
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
You're good at this, right, Jake?

230
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Oh!

231
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,000
Raise your sword!

232
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Don't resist!

233
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
You're the cause of the explosion!

234
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
I see.

235
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Yes, this guy did it.

236
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
This is the evil.

237
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
All right, be quiet, you evil.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You have a wooden sword.

239
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
What's with this smoke?

240
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
It's the best feeling ever!

241
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
You're the best!

242
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,000
I don't know what's going on, but...

243
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
I'm so happy!

244
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
The human heart is a man of evil and evil,

245
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
but the God's servant and the devil's servant,

246
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
the children of water and oil,

247
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
they all become one.

248
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,000
There's no way to wish for a future!

249
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
TENMAN CITY

250
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Come on, you fucking bitch!

251
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Huh? What's going on?

252
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,000
There they are! The bitch angels!

253
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,000
A peaceful city of angels suddenly turned into a sea of fire.

254
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Please see this video.

255
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
I'll get my panties off!

256
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
I can't go!

257
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:44,000
A large bread angel trampled down the store!

258
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,800
That's right, the ones who destroyed the city were all the party members of the shitty players.

259
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,360
That's what my sister said.

260
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,840
Fuck! Why is it my fault?

261
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,720
This guy destroyed the city too, right?

262
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:54,840
I don't know.

263
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,160
Because he became a demon.

264
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,480
This is the payment payment you sent.

265
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,640
You can pay me three times more.

266
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:04,040
Oh, right. Then pay me today.

267
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:05,960
Why is there a payment?

268
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,720
You guys used my Heavens Express Black Card that day.

269
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,120
The card is still here.

270
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,080
Oh, I see.

271
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:16,600
Shit! Why can't I buy it?

272
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,680
I told you the card was still here!

273
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,000
How boring!

274
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,480
Then let's have a party with the good guys.

275
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,760
P-P-P-Party! Look at this!

276
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:27,680
Look at this!

277
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,040
Huh? Huh?

278
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,240
Huh?

279
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,880
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

280
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,440
You're annoying.

281
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,400
I can't do either sex or sex.

282
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,120
My life is over!

283
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,680
I have a good idea.

284
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,280
Huh?

285
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
In such a poor place...

286
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,760
...is there a city dollar that's worth three times more?

287
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,640
Let's work part-time together until we get three times more.

288
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,200
It's enough for one person.

289
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:58,200
Right?

290
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,200
Welcome.

291
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,560
Welcome.

292
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,760
Welcome.

293
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,280
Yeah, make me yell!

294
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,600
I'm gonna die!

295
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:17,120
It's one big home!

296
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,920
Who's that?

297
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,360
Are you okay?

298
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,400
I am Super Gaijin!

299
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,360
Thank you very much!

300
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:30,680
He's a pain in the ass.

301
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,480
What's this?

302
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,680
The Legend Ultra Mega Secret Rare Card!

303
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,320
Blue Eyes White Angle?!

304
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,440
What's that?

305
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,920
This is a match-up card that's popular among Daten City's geeks!

306
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,440
Magic the Angry Angle!

307
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,440
It's a card that's so strong that it's the center of all the art in Alpha Test!

308
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:57,680
You're so stingy.

309
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,440
So, if I sell it, it's expensive?

310
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,160
This value is money!

311
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,080
I'm asking how much it is!

312
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:07,120
I think it's about three times more than the current rate of Daten City Dolls.

313
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,280
Three times?!

314
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:09,600
Yes!

315
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,920
Hey, give me this card.

316
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,640
No! This card is my heart!

317
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,080
It's a duelist card, only!

318
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Duelist?

319
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,920
Duelist?!

320
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,280
Only those who can fight in Magic the Angry Angle have the right to have cards!

321
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,280
Huh?

322
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,160
Hey you!

323
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,640
Where is me?!

324
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,280
The rules of the game are simple.

325
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,880
Make a deck of 60 cards.

326
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:37,640
Use 20 life points given to each player to scrape each other with various cards.

327
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:41,520
That's a duel stage where only the real players can climb.

328
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,520
And if your life is zero...

329
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,040
Oh my god! This is it!

330
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,280
I'm scared!

331
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,920
I play Seppuku!

332
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,760
Ah! Stop, stop!

333
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,520
I don't know, but if you lose, you die.

334
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,640
No, no!

335
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,080
The loser of this game has to hand over one card to the winner.

336
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,200
There's a local rule of darkness!

337
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,200
I'll take this card.

338
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,360
My heart is gone!

339
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,200
Wait!

340
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,040
That three-point hit City Doll is mine!

341
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,920
The value of the card is not just the price or the rarity.

342
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,520
Huh?

343
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,800
If it's worthless, it's worth nothing!

344
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,880
Don't be so sure about that.

345
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,520
That card is...

346
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,200
Three points?! Ten points?! A hundred points?!

347
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,600
That card is the lowest value, and has the highest production number.

348
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,440
It's a common card!

349
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,520
Uncle Knight of Poop!

350
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,360
What the hell? A shitty card?

351
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,560
That's right.

352
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,920
You called this card shit and wiped away Ben, and poured it into my blood.

353
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,360
The anger of those cards was born as a curse.

354
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,440
You bastard!

355
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,880
The robot's identity was...

356
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,000
Was it a ghost?!

357
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,320
My heart...

358
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,880
Hey, you ate it!

359
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,520
No, no, no, no, no, Fandy!

360
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:57,440
If you beat this guy, the cards of Blue-Eyes and Uncle Knight will explode in an instant!

361
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,760
Then what are you going to do?

362
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,520
I have to fight fair and square in a card game!

363
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,320
Welcome.

364
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,800
Good morning, Manager.

365
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,840
Hey, Nisox.

366
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,320
It's already that late?

367
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:14,000
Yeah, it's time for the shift in the afternoon.

368
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,520
Oh, there are a lot of customers.

369
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:19,720
Yeah, Bitch and Ghost are fighting right now.

370
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,680
Huh?

371
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:21,560
Whoa!

372
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:24,080
Fandy's Saturday Night Uncle is coming with the Sunday Morning Uncle,

373
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:26,840
which is being controlled by Ghost!

374
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,520
What the hell?! Fandy's life is only 1!

375
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,960
I don't care about that.

376
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,520
What's wrong with the momentum from earlier?

377
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,440
This Ghost is strong.

378
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,480
His strategy gained from an overwhelming experience

379
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,200
is as strong as Fandy, who's just a bitch celeb.

380
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,200
So I have to believe in his strength.

381
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,480
This is the end of the town.

382
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,680
It's Fandy's turn!

383
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,400
My turn! Draw!

384
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,880
Please!

385
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,160
I'll use this guy as a backfield,

386
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,320
as a back display, as a back call!

387
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,800
Hinerideo!

388
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,920
Uncle Night of Tooth!

389
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:00,920
Damn it, old man.

390
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:04,360
That guy is the weakest among the uncles.

391
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,240
His attack power is only 0.02.

392
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,440
Not only does he have a bad reputation for being called a bitch,

393
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,280
but he's got that same level of skill.

394
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,840
I'm more disappointed than you are!

395
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,920
This match is going to be as good as

396
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:15,800
the Blue-Eyes White Uncle.

397
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,280
Here goes my turn!

398
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,920
I'll put my left hand in my mouth and draw one card from my body!

399
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,720
Here it is!

400
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,120
I've drawn the Blue-Eyes White Uncle card!

401
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,520
What the hell?

402
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,520
I'll summon it!

403
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,520
It's finally out!

404
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:37,240
The Blue-Eyes White Uncle attack!

405
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,480
The destruction of the Uncle of Angra!

406
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,680
This is bad, Fandy!

407
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,280
If I do this, I'm going to die!

408
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
Why isn't there a card?

409
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
Let's see...

410
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,680
This one!

411
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,360
It's a really fat, black-and-black guy!

412
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,320
This is Black Dildo-tus!

413
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,280
Fandy, you can't just summon whatever you want!

414
00:18:58,280 --> 00:18:59,320
So what?

415
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,320
I've drawn so many builds!

416
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,720
They're the best!

417
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,520
Huh?

418
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,040
I think we've got all the pieces of victory.

419
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,400
What?

420
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,720
When the infinite Dildo guides the greatest of the Ogres,

421
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:20,520
the Uncle Knight of Poop will run through the Ecstasy Road!

422
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,640
The new, new-born, new-born,

423
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,640
All-in-Uncle Gamble Soldier!

424
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,880
No way! No way!

425
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,640
The uncle who's been living his life as a demon

426
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:33,560
has put a Dildo in his ass and put it in the Ecstasy Road!

427
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:35,160
What's he lost?

428
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:38,360
Is he trying to do something with the rest of his life?

429
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,960
That's ridiculous!

430
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,120
That's the Hundred-Face Knight!

431
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:44,880
I see!

432
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,640
The All-in-Uncle Gamble Soldier's death blow,

433
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,680
is only when he's faced with the Hundred-Face Knight,

434
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,960
can he gain a million times more power!

435
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,040
Let's fight!

436
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,000
But there's only one chance!

437
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,280
If I use anything else,

438
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:01,680
Fandy will be killed by the Blue-Eyes White-Uncle attack!

439
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,360
Is there such a lucky, fortunate person?

440
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,040
Who's the person?

441
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,200
I'm an angel, you idiot!

442
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,240
Here goes!

443
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:16,000
Destiny Dice Roll!

444
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,480
My attack!

445
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:26,600
All-in-Uncle Gamble Soldier Blade!

446
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:37,600
The Blue-Eyes White-Uncle attack is amazing!

447
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,600
It's amazing!

448
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,600
It's amazing!

449
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,600
It's amazing!

450
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
It's amazing!

451
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,600
It's amazing!

452
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:49,560
That's amazing, Fandy!

453
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
You're the true Nierid!

454
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,560
I can't believe I lost to the Uncle Knight of Poop,

455
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
who I can call my own avatar.

456
00:20:57,560 --> 00:21:01,560
I couldn't put myself in my own place.

457
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,560
I lost.

458
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,560
I'm sorry.

459
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Thank you, Fandy.

460
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:12,560
I did it!

461
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:15,560
Now I'm the angelic idol who's been defeated!

462
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,520
I have a bad news, Gans.

463
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,520
The Blue-Eyes White-Uncle attack has been decided, Gans.

464
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,520
Huh?

465
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,520
It's true!

466
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:28,520
The price of the card has dropped from 3 to 1 Daten City Dolls!

467
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:33,520
Takeboy, you wanted this card so badly that you got your hands dirty, didn't you?

468
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,520
I'll sell it for 3 Daten City Dolls.

469
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:43,520
Now, can I put on my new panties?

470
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,480
No!

471
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,480
I'll buy it!

472
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:48,480
I'll buy it!

473
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,480
I'll buy it!

474
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,480
No?

475
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:56,480
Then let's count the number of panties.

476
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,480
1 Daten City Dolls, Daten City Dolls, 1 Daten City Dolls...

477
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,480
This is the emergency news.

478
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,480
That bastard, Fandy, has decided to sell the 3 Daten City Dolls to the citizens.

479
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,440
He also bought the fashion brand Christian Del Dol and became the CEO.

480
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Hey, Fandy!

481
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:26,440
Hey, Fandy!

482
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,440
Hey, Fandy!

483
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
Hey, Fandy!

484
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,440
Fandy!

485
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
Bye!

486
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,440
I won't give up, can't wear the same ring there

487
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Jump into this mess with no exit yet

488
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,440
And because I may get fucked up

489
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,440
But that's the beat, the groove is in my heart

490
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:01,440
I'm certain I wear it right

491
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,440
I'm certain I wear it right

492
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,440
I'm certain I wear it right

493
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
I'm certain I wear it right

494
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
I'm certain I wear it right

495
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,440
I'm certain I wear it right

496
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,400
I'll wear it like a crown

497
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,400
I'll crush up on that love out loud

498
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,400
I'm not that close

499
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
I know it's true

500
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,400
But it's the madness that gets me through

501
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,400
I hope that's the time for me

502
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,400
I'll find a song

503
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,400
They say they know me

504
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,400
But that's the old me

505
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
Used to control me

506
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,400
But now they moldy

507
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,360
I made it and I did it

508
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,360
And you label me a medicine

509
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:45,360
A villain, cause you can't get with it

510
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
Hate my presence, hate my business

511
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,360
Got no feelings, good riddance

512
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,360
I'm reckless

513
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,360
Yeah, I know it's true

514
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,360
But it's the madness that gets me through

515
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,360
I hope you found some just for me

516
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,360
I'll find my song

517
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah

518
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
I'm not that close

519
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,360
I know it's true

520
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,360
But it's the madness that gets me through

521
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,360
I hope that's the time for me

522
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,360
I'll find a song

523
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,360
A villain, cause you can't get with it

524
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Hate my presence, hate my business

525
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
Got no feelings, good riddance

526
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,360
I'm reckless

527
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
Yeah, I know it's true

528
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:41,360
But it's the madness that gets me through
