The worst dojo ever

Stop fooling around, you little bitch!

21
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
What's with you, you little bitch?

22
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I can't take it anymore!

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I see. I can't take it either.

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,000
I'm so sick of it!

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
I'm so sick of it!

26
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
I'm so sick of it!

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
I'm so sick of it!

28
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Enough! I'm done with you!

29
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Enough! I'm done with you!

30
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
This is the tea I got from Mandragora

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I got from Mandragora

32
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Oh, my favorite!

33
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
But it's expensive, right?

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
I saved it for my beloved onee-sama

35
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
I saved it for my beloved onee-sama

36
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, I see. Then I'll start with the second round

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Oh, I see. Then I'll start with the second round

38
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
No, no, from onee-sama

39
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No, no, from onee-sama

40
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No, no, from onee-sama

41
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't believe this!

42
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Yesterday, because of Panty,

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Ghosts ran away and

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
ate special sweets from the Sweetcake Factory

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
that they were looking forward to

46
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
And at the end of the day,

47
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
you're like, listen to your sister!

48
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
What's this?

49
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
It's disgusting

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
It's my job!

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
The ghost that was chasing after me

52
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
has been captured

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
According to the report,

54
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
it's likely that the ghost is

55
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
attacking the Datenshiti Samurai Dojo

56
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
What's a samurai?

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
It's a wild man who swings his sword

58
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
like a famous angel over there

59
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
But!

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
The price of this samurai dojo is very high

61
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
The current price of our economy

62
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
is up to two pieces

63
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
So, this mission is

64
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
for the stocking and

65
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Where is the stocking?

66
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
We've already had a great time

67
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So, we're not sisters or buddies

68
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
If you're going with that kind of guy

69
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
it's better to go with the Iso Uro

70
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm going to be

71
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
a ghost with the angel?

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Don't make me laugh

73
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
I'm going to tell you the devil's name

74
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Ni Sox

75
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Dear onee-sama

76
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm going to work

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
to earn some money

78
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
I'm going to work with your sister, Ni Sox

79
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Oh, Ni Sox-san

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
You're too serious

81
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
about this

82
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm going to go with

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
the devil's name

84
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm going to go with

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
the devil's name

86
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Oh, my

87
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry to have

88
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
to be involved in your fight

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Besides, there's no reaction

90
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
from the ghost-transfer couple

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So, I have no choice but to find them

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
That's why you have to be

93
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
a student here

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Done!

95
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
The one who can grasp the flag with his feet

96
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
will accomplish anything

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
The path of a samurai, that is

98
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
the path of someone

99
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
The path of someone

100
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What is this?

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
It's like hell rather than hell

102
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
The path of someone

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
The path of someone

104
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Oh, my

105
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Hup, hup

106
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'm the master of this samurai dojo

107
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Manda

108
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you the new students?

109
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Yes, that's right

110
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Hmm, fine

111
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Follow me

112
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Now, wash my dog

113
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Huh?

114
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Dog? Why?

115
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
That's right. Why do we have

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
such a creepy dog?

117
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You're looking for a ghost, aren't you?

118
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you know anything?

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
If I say I know, I know

120
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
If I say I don't know, I don't know

121
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Huh?

122
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You'll understand one day

123
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
If you don't want to, get out of this dojo

124
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
right now

125
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Tomo, I think

126
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
it's better if you're honest

127
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Right

128
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
What's wrong with you, dog?

129
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Do you have a problem?

130
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I hate being called

131
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
That's why I'm good at washing dogs

132
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
First, I'll feed this dog

133
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
a bow-wow jerky

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
and pull the dog's tree

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
and wash it with a soft brush

136
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
and quickly feed the bow-wow jerky

137
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Look at the opponent

138
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
and read his breath

139
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It's important to match the timing

140
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'll feed the bow-wow jerky

141
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
and wash it with a soft brush

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'll feed the bow-wow jerky

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
and wash it with a soft brush

144
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
and quickly feed the bow-wow jerky

145
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
and quickly feed the bow-wow jerky

146
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
and quickly feed the bow-wow jerky

147
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Hey, Skurty

148
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
The bow-wow jerky's timing is slow

149
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Your timing of the soft brush

150
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
is too fast

151
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Is it my fault?

152
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
It's my fault

153
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Oh, you idiot

154
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
This is Kato, Musashi Kajirou Ganyu Jibanyu

155
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Oh, you're already noisy

156
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Shut up and let me show my face

157
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
You bastard

158
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
That's not a bow-wow jerky

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
That's my finger

160
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
This is good enough

161
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
F**k

162
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Well, I did what I had to do

163
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
I'll ask him to teach me about ghosts

164
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Hey, you

165
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't let people use you

166
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I won't

167
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Are you listening?

168
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You're so empty

169
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Who are you, Muichi?

170
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Wow, I'm Samurai sensei

171
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Good job, Miyabuta

172
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
What?

173
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You're the first ones to realize

174
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
that you're Kairai

175
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Is this what you mean?

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
By the way, where did you hear that voice?

177
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
It's a ghost

178
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's a ghost

179
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
The real Samurai dojo's vending machine is

180
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Ninja Ghost Ninja

181
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Ninja

182
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
The reason why the ghost app didn't react

183
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
was because it was a ninja

184
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You know ninjas?

185
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Of course

186
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
It's not a ghost

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
It's a mutant

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
That's a joke

189
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Oh my

190
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
It's a tattoo

191
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
If you see the real one

192
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
It's impossible to defeat me

193
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
That's easy

194
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
One in two

195
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'll hit you

196
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Damn it

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Fuck

198
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Fuck

199
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
It's useless

200
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
What the fuck

201
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Let's drink again

202
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
You did something unnecessary

203
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Shut up

204
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
What are you talking about?

205
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
You can't beat someone else

206
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're a devil

207
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
What?

208
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't bother me

209
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
I wanted to kill that ghost

210
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
But I attacked first

211
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So you attack another ghost

212
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
That's the rule

213
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
That's the basics of fighting

214
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Shut up

215
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
There's no rule in fighting

216
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
You're too serious

217
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
This is not a game

218
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
I'll do it

219
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's useless

220
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I'll beat you

221
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I don't know

222
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'll beat you

223
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't be stupid

224
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
I don't know

225
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
How much I've been patient

226
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,800
What do you know about your sister, who's just like Fanty?!

227
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,040
That's right.

228
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,760
I don't understand how my sister feels.

229
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,800
But my sister is...

230
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,200
She's been looking at her sister more than you think.

231
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,160
Oh...

232
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,440
She's been looking...

233
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,080
Look at your opponent closely and read your breath.

234
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,560
It's important to keep the timing in mind.

235
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,400
Well, you guys are my two-time favorite!

236
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,680
You're fabulous and elegant!

237
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,800
Huh?

238
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:49,200
I see...

239
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,760
So you thought using that trick meant nothing at all?

240
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,080
It seems you're fine with that.

241
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,220
Let go of your breath!

242
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,880
I see what you're saying!

243
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,400
Okay, look at your opponent closely and read your breath.

244
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,600
And...

245
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,920
Let go of your breath.

246
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:14,920
TF corner going Q&A

247
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:26,920
She and Takemura start by mindgames

248
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Well done! You're the best kids out there!

249
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,920
This is the best way!

250
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,920
Teacher!

251
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
Thank you very much!

252
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,920
Stocking!

253
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Why is the party here?

254
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,920
It's my business!

255
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,920
Anyway, I'm hungry, so let's go eat cake together.

256
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:03,920
You can call it Sweet Cake Factory, or whatever you like.

257
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,920
What? Who are you talking to?

258
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I-It can't be helped.

259
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,920
I can tell you, but it's your treat.

260
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,920
Don't be ridiculous! Why me?

261
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,920
I'm just following you, so of course.

262
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Well, whatever.

263
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Oh, you're in a hurry. Have you finished your work?

264
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:34,920
If so, I'll go home and have some tea time.

265
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:40,920
Oh, it's okay. It's for my cute little sister.

266
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
I'm going to the park.

267
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,920
I'm so cute!

268
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,920
Okay, send lots of hearts to everyone.

269
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
Here it comes!

270
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,920
Oh, my!

271
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
This feels so good!

272
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:29,920
Hey, you're making a weird noise. Is this a new masturbation?

273
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,920
You don't know what a party is?

274
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,920
Huh?

275
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,920
InfluenstaGram. It's a photo sharing app that's popular among kids in the city.

276
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:40,920
What's that?

277
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:48,920
If a cute and sweet top influencer like me posts a photo of her daily life on the app,

278
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,920
the followers will send her a heart.

279
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,920
And when the heart starts to beat...

280
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,920
...the fun will start!

281
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,920
What? There's nothing more fun than sex in this world!

282
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,920
Oh, you're lying!

283
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,920
What are you talking about?

284
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
You shouldn't do that, sister.

285
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,920
If you have time to be a stupid angel from the past,

286
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,920
let's make some hearts!

287
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
That's...

288
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,920
Hey, I told you I was going to do it!

289
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,920
You're a foodie, but you're so cheeky!

290
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,920
You're a little too sexy and red, so you shouldn't get carried away!

291
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Oh, you're so mean!

292
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,920
Sister, don't worry. Let's continue.

293
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,920
That's right!

294
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,920
Everyone, let's go!

295
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:37,920
Me too!

296
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
What's this?

297
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,920
What's going on?

298
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,920
Who's the popular angel from the past?

299
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Who's the top influencer?

300
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,920
If the top influencer is the most comfortable,

301
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
I'll beat you up!

302
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,920
But I'll do it right...

303
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:11,920
...and I'll make you happy!

304
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I'll do it right!

305
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,920
I'll do it right!

306
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,920
I'll do it right!

307
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,920
Hello, angel!

308
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,920
Welcome to the God Influencer Grand Contest!

309
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,920
Tonight, the real top influencer will be decided!

310
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:36,640
Let's welcome them with a big round of applause!

311
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,140
Tonight's God Influencers!

312
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,560
First up, Stalker!

313
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,360
Stanty!

314
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,280
Knee Shorts!

315
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,480
And Panty!

316
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,280
Okay!

317
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,780
Yay!

318
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,520
What's with that low-class outfit?

319
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,160
Huh? You don't know?

320
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:55,520
This is the latest trend these days, SDGs,

321
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,400
the Kamistro style!

322
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,200
Oh, more!

323
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,000
Poor Hawkeye!

324
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,700
You're gonna get wet like that!

325
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:04,420
Are you ready?

326
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:06,820
Now, the vote of fate!

327
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,820
Start!

328
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,620
Eight!

329
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,060
This is it!

330
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:13,700
This is it!

331
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,620
I knew it!

332
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,460
I'm a human!

333
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:19,740
More!

334
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,620
More!

335
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,540
What's this?

336
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,260
What's this?

337
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:23,860
Oh!

338
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,740
I'm so scared!

339
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,380
G-Gori! Gori!

340
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,700
Gori! Gori!

341
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,700
Gori! Gori!

342
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,700
Gori! Gori!

343
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,700
Gori! Gori!

344
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,700
G-G-G-G-Gata, what's that?

345
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:41,700
That's a G-Gori mount, Ghost!

346
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,700
Gori! Gori! Gori!

347
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,700
Gori! Gori!

348
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:49,700
The living Shrouded Wrecks have been born from the true nature of those who kept taking mounts until their death!

349
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,700
Panty and the others ate it!

350
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,700
Oh no!

351
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:59,700
The evil angel who was called the Shrouded Wrecks was made into a part of that ghost!

352
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,700
We have to save Panty and the others!

353
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,700
But what should we do?

354
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:05,700
There's only one way to save them!

355
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
That's right!

356
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,700
We'll climb up to the top!

357
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,700
Come on, this way!

358
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,700
Help me!

359
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
Please help us!

360
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,700
The giant Gori is in the shape of the Shrouded Wrecks!

361
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:28,700
We're not being watched at all!

362
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,700
The whole town is following us!

363
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Everyone's eyes are...

364
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:35,700
What a comfortable gaze...

365
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,700
The shopping is so full of...

366
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:54,700
Foolish desire can only sweetly fill our hearts at times.

367
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:00,700
But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

368
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,700
Yeah, it's the survival of the fittest.

369
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,700
Moving with the tide, never slowing down.

370
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:33,700
Race to the finish, I wear the crown.

371
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,700
No looking back, gotta leave the pack.

372
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,700
Boom for the hustle, I'm staying on track.

373
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,700
I'll take the Tsunasando.

374
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,700
My name is Bram Bram.

375
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,700
I have a favor to ask.

376
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Rubber.

377
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,700
Rubber meat is very soft.

378
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,700
By the way, I want to go over there.

379
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:06,700
You need a family for that.

380
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Let me introduce you to my wife.

381
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,700
She looks like a lady.

382
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,700
Good life.

383
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,700
This is Tezuri.

384
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,700
He's a clever mechanic.

385
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Nice to meet you, Mega Dog.

386
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,700
Nice to meet you, too.

387
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Koman.

388
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:30,700
He's a bad-mouthed, arrogant guy.

389
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,700
But he's not a bad guy.

390
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,700
Jobs.

391
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,700
He was a former chef and a special investigator.

392
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Now he's my brother.

393
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,700
He's a so-called pro-Jobs.

394
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:44,700
If you smile, what's a cook is cooking?

395
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Love-G.

396
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:48,700
As the name suggests, he's a genius who likes G.

397
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Nice to meet you.

398
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,700
Lastly, Han.

399
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,700
He's a mad guy who likes sweets.

400
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,700
Let's get started.

401
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,700
I got this from my dad.

402
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,700
Let's modify the Dutch.

403
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,700
Cowper vehicle V12 Turbo.

404
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:17,700
It takes time to go to the highest speed, but if it's done, it's mine.

405
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
What route should we take?

406
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,700
The same as the first one.

407
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,700
The fastest route is this way.

408
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,700
I pray for the success of the operation.

409
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:31,700
Zamen.

410
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,700
I'm hungry.

411
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,700
I'll feed you a lot of bread later.

412
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
There's a hole on the top.

413
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
There's a hole on the bottom.

414
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,700
Which one is it?

415
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,700
It's up there.

416
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,700
The ground is wet.

417
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:56,700
It seems to be fighting until a while ago.

418
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,700
He's gone home, too.

419
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
I don't have anything to do.

420
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:11,700
I'm bored.

421
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:12,700
Yeah.

422
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,700
Something's coming.

423
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,700
I'm half asleep, but I'm going to hit you.

424
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,700
This guy is crazy.

425
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,700
He's out.

426
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,700
I'm going to hit the G-spot on the ceiling.

427
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,700
Koma, I'm over there.

428
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,700
Damn it.

429
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,700
Why me?

430
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,700
Damn it.

431
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
It's me.

432
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,700
Goma, that's it.

433
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Turn the cock.

434
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Leave it to me.

435
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,700
Goal!

436
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,700
Don't wait until you go.

437
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:43,700
Thank you.

438
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:56,700
You and I were brothers at full speed.

439
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,700
We run the same road at full speed.

440
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:04,700
We go on a different road at full speed.

441
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,700
I'm going to hit you.

442
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,700
I'm going to hit you.

443
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,700
I'm going to hit you.

444
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,700
I'm going to hit you.

445
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
I'm going to hit you.

446
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,700
I'm going to hit you.

447
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,700
I'm going to hit you.

448
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,700
I'm going to hit you.

449
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,700
I'm going to hit you.

450
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:30,700
I'm going to hit you.

451
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,700
I'm going to hit you.

452
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,700
I'm going to hit you.

453
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,700
I'm going to hit you.

454
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,700
I'm going to hit you.

455
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,700
The truth is in my heart.

456
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,700
I'm a thirties.

457
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,700
I wear it like a crown.

458
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,700
I crash up and I laugh out loud.

459
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,700
I'm reckless.

461
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,700
Yeah, I know it's true.

462
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,700
But the madness that gets me through.

463
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:59,700
I hope the stars don't touch for me.

464
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,700
I promise all.

465
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

466
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,700
They say they know me.

467
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:07,700
But that's the old me.

468
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,700
Used to control me.

469
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,700
But now they moldy.

470
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,700
Yup, committed and I did it.

471
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,700
And you labor me a medicine, a villain.

472
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:15,700
Cause you can't get with it.

473
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,700
Hate my presence.

474
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,700
Hate my business.

475
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,700
Got no feelings.

476
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,700
Good riddance.

477
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:20,700
I'm reckless.

478
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,700
Yeah, I know it's true.

479
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,700
But it's the madness that gets me through.

480
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,700
I hope the stars don't touch for me.

481
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,700
I promise all.

482
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,700
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

483
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,700
I'm reckless.

484
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Yeah, I know it's true.

485
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,700
But the madness that gets me through.

486
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,700
I hope the stars don't touch for me.

487
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,700
Cause you can't get with it.

488
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,700
Yeah, I know it's true.

489
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,700
But it's the madness that gets me through.

490
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,700
I hope the stars don't touch for me.

491
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,700
Cause you can't get with it.

492
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
Yeah, I know it's true.

493
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,700
But the madness that gets me through.

494
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:49,700
I hope the stars don't touch for me.

495
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,700
Cause you can't get with it.

496
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,700
Yeah, I know it's true.

497
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,700
But the madness that gets me through.

498
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,700
I hope the stars don't touch for me.

499
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,700
Cause you can't get with it.

500
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,700
Cause you can't get with it.

501
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,700
Cause you can't get with it.

502
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,700
Cause you can't get with it.

503
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:58,700
Cause you can't get with it.

504
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,700
I'm going to go.

505
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,700
I'm going to go.

506
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:02,700
I'm going to go.

507
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,700
I'm going to go.

508
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,700
I'm going to go.

509
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,700
I'm going to go.

510
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,700
I'm going to go.

511
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,700
I'm going to go.

512
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,700
I'm going to go.

513
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:09,700

I'm going to go.

519
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
I'm going to go.

520
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,700
I'm going to go.

521
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
I'm going to go.

522
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,700

I'm going to go.

530
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,700
I'm going to go.
