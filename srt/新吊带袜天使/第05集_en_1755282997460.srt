Today's Route 777 is still in the middle of the road, baby!

20
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
It's been a week since the opening,

21
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,000
and here we are!

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Come on, come on!

23
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Wow!

24
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The Gatling City has been attacked, baby!

25
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
This is a perfect...

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

27
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Woo!

28
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Ha!

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Shoot!

30
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Attack, Jack! Attack, Jack!

31
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Oh, sister!

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Oh, Nisakute-san!

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Was it a bad time?

34
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Yes, I got sweaty from the job at the fossil-dusting place.

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But more importantly, sister!

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Were you in the bathroom?

37
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Could it be?

38
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Yes, it's been a week since I've been in the bathroom.

39
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Congratulations!

40
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I didn't think this would happen.

41
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I feel refreshed now.

42
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Oh, you're still not released from the bathroom?

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
You shouldn't be patient with your body.

44
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Now, Nisakute-san, don't mind me.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
This is a bad time.

46
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You're a devil.

47
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're right, sister.

48
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm a devil, too.

49
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Nisakute-san!

50
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What a big sushi!

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
If you're going to expose this situation,

52
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
you'll be in trouble!

53
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
What is this?

54
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I won't stop Reion until you say yes!

55
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I won't stop Reion until you say yes!

56
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
That's the ghost born from the grudge of the Sushokurin

57
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
who said this without being recognized by the master!

58
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,000
It's definitely the Sushokurin Ghost!

59
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
That uniform!

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Nisakute-san!

61
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,000
It's the same uniform I wore when I worked part-time at the restaurant!

62
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Master!

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Only you can stop this hurricane!

64
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Master!

65
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Master, please!

66
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Please accept my offer!

67
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I won't let you get away with this!

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I'll start over from the start!

69
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Master!

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'll quickly take my clothes off and get some fresh air!

71
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
I'll quickly take my clothes off and get some fresh air!

72
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll quickly take my clothes off and get some fresh air!

73
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I'll quickly take my clothes off and get some fresh air!

74
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
That's the super cell form of the devil

75
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,000
that will be activated when the power of the devil

76
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
is reached its limit

77
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
and the energy of the sister's body is reached its limit!

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and the energy of the sister's body is reached its limit!

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
If you want to grab me like that,

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll let you do it!

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
In hell!

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
I'll do it like my sister said!

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I'll do it like my sister said!

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Return to the darkness!

85
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
You idiot!

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Stay strong!

87
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Attack!

88
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Rock'n'roll!

89
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The density!

90
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Route 777 is open, baby!

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I feel refreshed!

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I feel refreshed!

93
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
I feel refreshed!

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I feel refreshed!

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
I feel refreshed!

96
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm the one who was abandoned by the red-eyed devil!

97
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I'll bite you, animal lover!

98
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I've been waiting for a guy like you to cut my head off!

99
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I've been waiting for a guy like you to cut my head off!

100
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
It's Big Love!

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
100...

102
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Garter, don't be a good guy!

103
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Big Love!

104
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Oh no!

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I was planning to do a handsome holist breaking fax!

106
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I forgot!

107
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Today is the release day of the chocolate brownie without beads!

108
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Then I'll leave the turtle head to Garter!

109
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I'll leave the turtle head to Garter!

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
100...

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-Panty, Garter is crazy!

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Huh?

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
He's been crazy since before, right?

114
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Hey, I heard that Garter's been crazy.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,000
It's been crazy.

116
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
Garter is...

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm done for.

118
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That was really bad.

119
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
That's why I told you!

120
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Garter, did you get possessed by the turtle head ghost?

121
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
It's not a cosplay.

122
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
It's not a cosplay.

123
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What's going on?

124
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Wow!

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Kaiju is my hero!

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
Hey, hey, you're getting bigger than before.

127
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
If this goes on, the town will be in trouble.

128
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
I guess we have to get Garter back to normal.

129
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Wow! Kaiju is my hero!

130
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Hey, hey, it's food, Garter.

131
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Wake up!

132
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
You're not a turtle that was abandoned by Garter.

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:20,000
You're just a lonely old man who has no friends!

134
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Garter, you're a fool!

135
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Garter, I'm sorry.

136
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
I said the truth.

137
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Hey.

138
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Well, the truth is that Garter is not a turtle.

139
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
Wow, is this an egg?

140
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
It was a sea turtle ghost.

141
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
So it's a female?

142
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
It's born!

143
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
It's so small.

144
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
It's so cute!

145
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Look, it's heading to the sea.

146
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Huh?

147
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
This isn't food, is it?

148
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's do a cross-rider chicken.

149
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Go over there.

150
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
It's almost at the sea.

151
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Go for it!

152
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Go for it!

153
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Go for it!

154
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go for it!

155
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Go for it!

156
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Go for it!

157
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Go for it!

158
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Go for it!

159
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Go for it!

160
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Go for it!

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,000
You did a good job.

162
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I'm tired.

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
What's this?

164
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,000
The Tent City is being taken over.

165
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
My beloved babies are growing.

166
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
The baby's growing.

167
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
The babies are growing.

168
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
The babies are growing.

169
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
The babies are growing.

170
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,000
This city will be occupied by those with turtle heads.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,000
This is the turtle head plan that I came up with with the turtle head.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Oh my god, the monster is bad.

173
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,000
There's no need to be afraid of being thrown away by humans.

174
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,000
This world is a world of turtles that are controlled by turtles.

175
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's a turtle war!

176
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
There's no way that's going to happen!

177
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Turtle head!

178
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Gata, I heard you're going to be late for a date today.

179
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Date?

180
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I heard you're a pet who's been hunting for a long time.

181
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
I was a turtle until the last time I was a baby, but I'm not going to go on a date.

182
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Could this be Gata's egg?

183
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
It's a golf ball.

184
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Don't scare me.

185
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Thank you.

186
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

187
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

188
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

189
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

190
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

191
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

192
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

193
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

194
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

195
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

196
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

197
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

198
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

199
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

200
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

201
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

202
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

203
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

204
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Fucking brunette bitch!

205
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
Why are you so drunk?

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Because you're too loose, fucking brunette.

207
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
What do you mean by drunk?

208
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
Help me!

209
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Ouch! Help me!

210
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
No! Stop!

211
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
The 4th victim

212
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
The 4th victim

213
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The serial killer who tried to kill the brunette bitch.

214
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
The serial killer who tried to kill the brunette bitch.

215
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Don't underestimate me.

216
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
I'm not going to be beaten by a fucking psycho.

217
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
But the victims so far are similar to Panty.

218
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
They're not.

219
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,000
But this case is like the beginning of a horror movie.

220
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
What?

221
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
The theory of a horror movie.

222
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
You know what?

223
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:52,000
The brunette bitch is going to be killed by the first victim of a horror movie.

224
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
In other words, the brunette bitch can't become the final girl.

225
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
What are you talking about?

226
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I'm sorry.

227
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
The final girl is going to be killed by the last victim of a horror movie.

228
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:07,340
A

229
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,000
serial killer.

230
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
I want you to protect your body.

231
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
You're the best.

232
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
I'll take care of it.

233
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If you say that, the serial killer will...

234
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
What?

235
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,000
In the safe house, they will be on the bed every night.

236
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
They will be on the bed every night.

237
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
I'm going.

238
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,000
The safe house that once was a dormitory building.

239
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,000
We gather the victims of the crime and protect them.

240
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Now, the brunette bitches from the city of Tappen are here.

241
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I think everyone will be killed now.

242
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Is that okay?

243
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Hey, grandma.

244
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
That's a big deal.

245
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,000
It's not wrinkled, but it's not dry.

246
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Wow, bitch joke.

247
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
You're an angel.

248
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
You're old, aren't you?

249
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,000
This is to check the safety of Bunty.

250
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
I'm not a stalker.

251
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Bunty!

252
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,000
No!

253
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
What?

254
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
What's going on?

255
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Wait a minute!

256
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Open the door!

257
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Open the door!

258
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
Open the door!

259
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Open the door!

260
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
I'm not a bad person.

261
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,000
I'm just a ghost.

262
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,000
Bitch.

263
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Yes. Yes. Yes.

264
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.

265
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Yes.

266
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
What's this?

267
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:22,000
A bug!

268
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Bitch.

269
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
It stinks.

270
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
What's this?

271
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:41,000
It's rotten meat.

272
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
Why is it like this?

273
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Hey, you don't have to spit all the time.

274
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,000
Help me out.

275
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Fuck.

276
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
It got on my hand.

277
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
It's dirty.

278
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
It stinks.

279
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Ghost?

280
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Wait!

281
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
What?

282
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Ghost is the one who committed the crime.

283
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Fuck.

284
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I ran away, but I can't do anything about that damage anymore.

285
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Then the case is solved.

286
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
I'm going to go to the police station.

287
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
I'll be right back.

288
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
I'm going to go to the police station.

289
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,000
I'm going to go to the police station.

290
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I'm going to go to the police station.

291
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
I can't do anything about that.

292
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Then the case is solved.

293
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
It's better than that.

294
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,000
I'm going to go to the police station.

295
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,000
Huh?

296
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I've seen this guy before.

297
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
No, anyone.

298
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Right?

299
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,000
It's a living one.

300
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
What's this?

301
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,000
It's sweet.

302
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Is it a white one?

303
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Hey, old man.

304
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,000
This isn't blood.

305
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,000
What?

306
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,000
What about the ghost?

307
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,000
Geek Boy?

308
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
Could it be that this one is also a tongue?

309
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
No, this one is really dead.

310
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,000
That means...

311
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
It's not good.

312
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm getting a stomach ache.

313
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I'm getting a stomach ache.

314
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,000
How could you do this to me?

315
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,000
I was attacked by a ghost.

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Sir, this is a knife that the ghost dropped.

317
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,000
What's this?

318
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
It's a blade sharpener.

319
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
It's like a movie tool.

320
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
That's right.

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
This is also a movie tool.

322
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
I remember now.

323
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I remember when the ghost killed me.

324
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
I remember now.

325
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
I know now.

326
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
What?

327
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,000
That ghost was just playing horror movies.

328
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,000
That means the culprit who killed Blond Bitch is somewhere else.

329
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:46,000
It has nothing to do with the ghost and the serial killer.

330
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,000
No, the culprit used the ghost to try to hide the investigation.

331
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Is he always like this?

332
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
I don't know.

333
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
I've been thinking too much about horror movies.

334
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
Horror movies?

335
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
That's it!

336
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
That's my phone.

337
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
I see.

338
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,000
I was looking for the ghost at that time.

339
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Buddy, search for Buddy instead.

340
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What? No.

341
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,000
The title of an old movie is Blitch's serial killer.

342
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,000
It's a B-class horror movie that's not good for the fans.

343
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,000
For some reason, it's so famous that it's a meme among horror movie fans.

344
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Stop here.

345
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Something is reflected on the bridge.

346
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Hey, isn't this the ghost from before?

347
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,000
It's been said that it's a real ghost movie, but it was actually a ghost.

348
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,000
And there's another person in this scene.

349
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
The person we know is reflected.

350
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Where is she now?

351
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
You're finally back.

352
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
I'm sure you were able to kill her this time.

353
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
What?

354
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,340
You're a

355
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:56,000
B-class horror movie.

356
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
Did you really come from me?

357
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
You are...

358
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,000
It can't be helped.

359
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:03,000
This is the real ghost.

360
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
It's not a toy to scare the kids.

361
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
I'll tell you.

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
The real killer.

363
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
That's it.

364
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,000
You knew this place.

365
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Thanks to this, I know where the panties are.

366
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
That means...

367
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,000
You know where I am.

368
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
So it was you.

369
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,000
The legendary actress who was called the queen of B-class horror movies.

370
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:36,000
The killer of the B-class serial killer is you, Mobzako Bicchi.

371
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:44,000
That's right. I'm the legendary blonde bitch queen, Mobzako Bicchi.

372
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,000
Was your grandmother a celebrity?

373
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,000
The legendary actress who played the blonde bitch who was killed by B-class horror.

374
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
I played the blonde bitch of B-class horror.

375
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,000
Then I played the B-class horror.

376
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
And then I played the blonde bitch who was killed by the beginning.

377
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,000
My career as an actress was the same.

378
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Then, the ghost was born because of my hatred for B-class horror.

379
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
But this is a very big bug.

380
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I was born because of my hatred for B-class horror.

381
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:16,000
What kind of joke is this?

382
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
It's really ridiculous.

383
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
B-class horror is...

384
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
What's wrong with ridiculous?

385
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
It may be a delicate trick.

386
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
It may be cheap blood.

387
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,000
But there are moments when it looks real or more real.

388
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
You should have seen that moment before.

389
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,000
But why did you kill the real one?

390
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,000
Why?

391
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The leading role is already in the back.

392
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,000
It's not worth it to have a final.

393
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I decided to be the real main character, the serial killer.

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Why did you kill the blonde bitches?

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
The serial killer kills the blonde bitch first.

396
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
And the horror is interesting in the beginning.

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,000
So I understood the beginning.

398
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Are you done, grandma?

399
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Shut up, you bitch angel.

400
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Oh, you're finally ready for the Pongra Ghost.

401
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Then I'll kill them.

402
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,000
Hey, meat boy.

403
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
I see.

404
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You're happy about this.

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:27,000
So the case was closed.

406
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
The final girl in this story is Kana.

407
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,000
Kana is the main character of the story.

408
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,000
The final girl in this story is Kanojo.

409
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
The monster became a hero at the end.

410
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:50,000
The former horror queen became a monster herself at the end of the madness.

411
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:55,000
No, we may be the horror fans who made her go crazy.

412
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Who made the theory that blonde bitches were killed in the beginning?

413
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,000
Who is the real monster?

414
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,000
The real monster is Kana.

415
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000

416
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,000
