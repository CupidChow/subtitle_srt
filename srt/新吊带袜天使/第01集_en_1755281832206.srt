1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,020
It was urgent to remove this part because I didn't want to reproduce the battlec methodology.

2
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:18,020
One day, a new student appeared and everything about me changed!

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,020
Panty and Stocking's fallen angel sisters!

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:25,020
The two were used by the Heaven Realm to defeat the ghosts that haunt this town,

5
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:28,020
and protect the peace on Earth!

6
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:35,020
Panty and Stocking are usually at the cemetery hill church where the Gartabelt priest lives,

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,020
but in reality, they're such dirty, anarchy angels that they're unimaginable angels!

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:45,020
Those two are true heroes, super-duper-super-super-bitch-heroines!

9
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:51,020
But then, a new student appeared from the underworld and started to get in Panty's way!

10
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,020
Scanty and Ni-socks, the devilish sisters!

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,020
Ooh, their red horns are terrifying!

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,020
And that evil-looking boss, Corset, is going to open the Hell's Gate, which was sealed in the Fallen City,

13
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:07,020
and attack the whole world with a giant, chinko-like gong!

14
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,020
That's going to be a lot of trouble!

15
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,020
My relationship with Panty is starting to get better, but...

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:17,020
Panty's first and last curtain is being rewound and Pitchi is gone,

17
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:21,020
and my ginko is the key to opening the Hell's Gate, for some reason,

18
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,020
and so many things are happening in the Ten-ya-Wan-ya's Nyan-ya-Kan-ya,

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:29,020
and I'm going to take advantage of Panty and Stocking's mother's power and get out of here!

20
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,020
Everything will be back to normal and peaceful!

21
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,020
And then...

22
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,020
Aaaaaaah!

23
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,020
I'm sorry. I'm actually a demon.

24
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:54,020
I'm going to leave Panty, who's got 666 of them, on the road!

25
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,020
Come and get me, Odin!

26
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,020
Panty is dead...

27
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:12,020
I'm going to live my life without Panty forever...

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:17,020
Goodbye, Panty. Goodbye, my...

29
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:19,020
Pitchi Angel!

30
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:33,020
How many years have passed since then?

31
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:35,020
Panty is gone...

32
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:40,020
The big hole in my heart...

33
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,020
It's not going to be filled with anything else...

34
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,020
What should I do, Panty?

35
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:51,020
What's wrong, Brief?

36
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:57,020
You've been thinking about it for 15 years now, and you're making that face...

37
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,020
That's right...

38
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,020
When I think about it, it's because Panty was torn apart by 666 of them...

39
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,020
If we're talking about the time we spent together...

40
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,020
That's right...

41
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,020
5 minutes!

42
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,020
That's right! 5 minutes have passed since then!

43
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,020
So give up, it's too early!

44
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,020
Listen, Brief. Panty is an angel.

45
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,020
Look! This is a piece of Panty that was cut off!

46
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,020
If we hurry up and put it back together, it might be a problem again!

47
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:35,020
That's right! I got it! I got it, Garter! I'll do it!

48
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:39,020
All right, go!

49
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,020
Brief and Jack, wait!

50
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,020
Jack!

51
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,020
Garter Belt!

52
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:54,020
Listen, we're going to collect all 666 pieces of Panty and measure the angel's life!

53
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,020
But...

54
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:58,020
You need the power of the devil for that!

55
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,020
We're not done yet!

56
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,020
Shut up!

57
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,020
Follow me without dying!

58
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:07,020
We're not done yet!

59
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:12,020
Kill them! This evil plan is not over yet!

60
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:17,020
We're the only ones who can save this world and Gaten City!

61
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:19,020
Let's go, Brief and Jack!

62
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,020
Jack with Garter Belt!

63
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,020
Future Ninja Demon Sister!

64
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,020
Let's go!

65
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,020
I didn't think it would go so well!

66
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:37,020
Now, I'll explain for the bad kids watching this!

67
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,020
Make the angel a devil!

68
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,020
I'm the devil's crocette.

69
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,020
I'm a bit of a jealous angel because of you.

70
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,020
I'm a bit of a jealous angel because of you.

71
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:51,020
But I'm not going to fall for nothing.

72
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:54,020
First, I'll cut off the head of the crocette.

73
00:04:54,020 --> 00:05:00,020
I'll put the microcossette in the angel's ear.

74
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,020
I'll whisper in front of the eardrum.

75
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,020
You're the devil!

76
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:09,020
If I keep whispering, I'll be a monster!

77
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,020
I'm the devil.

78
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
I'm the devil.

79
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,020
I'm the devil.

80
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,020
I'm the devil.

81
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
I'm the devil.

82
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,020
I'm sorry.

83
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,020
I'm actually a devil.

84
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:25,020
Yes! Now the angel is a devil!

85
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,020
I'm glad I could do this.

86
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,020
I'm glad I could do this.

87
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:33,020
I'm glad I could do this.

88
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:38,020
Now I can open the second Hell Gate in the next city.

89
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,020
Oh, yeah!

90
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:46,020
I'll make this guy a more perfect devil so that he doesn't go back to the angel again.

91
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,020
I'm the devil.

92
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,020
I'm the devil.

93
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,020
I'm the devil.

94
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,020
I'm the devil.

95
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,020
I'm the devil.

96
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,020
I'm the devil.

97
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,020
I'm the devil.

98
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:03,020
I'm the devil.

99
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:05,020
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

100
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,020
Hey!

101
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:10,020
I think I've got too big.

102
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,020
It's a huge monster!

103
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:17,020
Huh? Wait a minute.

104
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,020
If this guy's here, he's going to go to the angel.

105
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,020
You don't have to use our key man to open the key.

106
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,020
Blambi Blambi!

107
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:29,020
I don't need this kind of garbage anymore.

108
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,020
I'm the devil and I'm the devil.

109
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,020
I'm going to open the second Hell Gate with your stupid power.

110
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,020
What's that cute ghost?

111
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,020
There's an angel's ring.

112
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,020
Wait, that's a stocking.

113
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:53,020
But why is the stocking a ghost?

114
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:56,020
I'm sure it's Corse's doing.

115
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,020
The brainwashing is the devil's specialty.

116
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:01,020
What? It was brainwashing?

117
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:03,020
So it wasn't the devil?

118
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,020
It looks like that.

119
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,020
Look at that.

120
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,020
The power of the angel and the devil in the stocking is reflecting.

121
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,020
The energy that came out of the knife is reflected in the closed Hell Gate.

122
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:15,020
No!

123
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:17,020
If this continues, the fallen angel will be destroyed.

124
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:19,020
Before that, we have to save the stocking.

125
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,020
It's not something you can do so much.

126
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,020
If there was a party at this time...

127
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,020
It's finally peaceful.

128
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,020
What's this?

129
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,020
What's this?

130
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,020
This is very close.

131
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,020
It's a situation of danger.

132
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,020
The fallen angel who thought the peace had come has a huge ghost.

133
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,020
What's going on, fallen angel?

134
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,020
I've got a beat.

135
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,020
Are you going to chase me?

136
00:07:48,020 --> 00:07:50,020
What are you doing?

137
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:53,020
That building is a cake.

138
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:55,020
Are you stupid?

139
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,020
That building is chocolate.

140
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,020
What are you doing?

141
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,020
A huge ghost suddenly started eating the building.

142
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,020
Is it really delicious?

143
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,020
You're a fool.

144
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:11,020
If this continues, the microcorset will be more and more.

145
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:16,020
I'm tired of being beaten again.

146
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:20,020
Something is coming.

147
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,020
It's a finger.

148
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,020
What's going on?

149
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:32,020
My cute microcorset has lost to the fallen angel's appetite.

150
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,020
I'm tired of it.

151
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:36,020
No, it's okay.

152
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,020
This is good.

153
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:45,020
Look at that.

154
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,020
Wait, finger.

155
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:51,020
I'll make you eat the party.

156
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,020
The fallen angel is angry.

157
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:57,020
I hate the remaining four.

158
00:08:57,020 --> 00:09:00,020
What is that remaining four doing?

159
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:03,020
That's what I'm going to do.

160
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,020
The angel and the devil's power are moving.

161
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,020
It's a place where the spirit of the human race is over the human race.

162
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,020
What? What did you start this time?

163
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:16,020
Are you going to make a self-destruction on the head of the ghost?

164
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,020
It's a party.

165
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,020
It's a party.

166
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,020
I'm really bored.

167
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:24,020
After a long and short time,

168
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:30,020
the angel's body is once again possessed by the soul of 666 angels.

169
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,020
It's becoming like a human form.

170
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:38,020
Be born again.

171
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:41,020
I'm going to be used by the world and be a bitch angel.

172
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,020
Don't look at me.

173
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:46,020
I'm embarrassed.

174
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,020
What is this?

175
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:49,020
The skirt is short.

176
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,020
Angel, you're a bitch angel.

177
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:54,020
You're a bitch who's more big and annoying.

178
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:56,020
This is a feeling of being angry.

179
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:59,020
Panty.

180
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,020
What's wrong with you?

181
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,020
You're a bitch.

182
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
You're free.

183
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:07,020
You're a bitch.

184
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:10,020
I can't say such dirty words.

185
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:13,020
I'm curious.

186
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,020
This is not panty.

187
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,020
My favorite panties are more big.

188
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,020
Do you want to say you're a bitch?

189
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:23,020
Do you want me to be a bitch because I like it?

190
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:25,020
Isn't that a bitch's push?

191
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,020
It's a diverse era.

192
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:30,020
It's a man, it's a woman, it's a panty, it's a bitch.

193
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,020
What do you mean?

194
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:32,020
Who decided it?

195
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:33,020
But...

196
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:37,020
How terrible am I to push my sense of value into panties?

197
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,020
You're a do-es geek who wears the skin of a do-em geek.

198
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,020
No.

199
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,020
Do you like panties or bitches?

200
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:49,020
I'm going to get you!

201
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,020
No!

202
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,020
You're a bitch!

203
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:56,020
At this rate, you're not just failing at panties.

204
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:00,020
I'm so angry that humans are just standing there.

205
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,020
At least get the big ones.

206
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,020
That's a good idea, Mr. Nisokisu.

207
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:07,020
We should let them have a meal together.

208
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:09,020
Sister, if that's the case,

209
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:11,020
we have the perfect item for the Demon Realm Online Store.

210
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,020
This is...

211
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:16,020
It's a fabulous big-size change lotion with the satin logo.

212
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,020
This is a great size for the king.

213
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,020
Yes.

214
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,020
If you say so, I'll get it right away.

215
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:23,020
It's here.

216
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:25,020
Huh?

217
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,020
This is the Demon Realm Online Store.

218
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:29,020
It's got some kind of dangerous mark on it, but it's not going anywhere.

219
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,020
You're not going to get any less.

220
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,020
Stop it, you little bitch!

221
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,020
Victory!

222
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:55,020
That's right!

223
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,020
Panties are panties!

224
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:01,020
No matter what kind of panties they are, I love panties!

225
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,020
Big!

226
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:04,020
Big!

227
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,020
Big!

228
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:08,020
No!

229
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:10,020
I knew it, it's impossible.

230
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:13,020
I tried to brainwash myself, but it's impossible!

231
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,020
Hey, stop thinking about it!

232
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,020
Update it!

233
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,020
You're going to adjust it to the times, right?

234
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,020
But...

235
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:22,020
But I can't lie to myself.

236
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,020
Hey, this huge woman is a no-pan.

237
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,020
You can't broadcast it.

238
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,020
What? No-pan?

239
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,020
Oh, no panties!

240
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:33,020
That's a no-pan!

241
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,020
I see, that's what it is.

242
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:37,020
What do you mean?

243
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:39,020
Chuck, are you fat?

244
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:43,020
What do you need to get bigger and bigger?

245
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:50,020
When I revived that panty, I probably only had 660 pieces of it.

246
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,020
You mean you didn't have enough?

247
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:55,020
That's right. That's the most important part.

248
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,020
The true meaning of panties.

249
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,020
Chuck!

250
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:01,020
This is the last piece!

251
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:03,020
This is the panty's...

252
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:05,020
It's hot!

253
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,020
This is it!

254
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:09,020
This is the panty's soul!

255
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:13,020
It's the big, burning baguette of the bitch angel!

256
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,020
It's a baguette!

257
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:18,020
Why did it get so big when I put it on?

258
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:22,020
How can I carry this to the other side?

259
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:26,020
That's all I have.

260
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,020
I'm going to...

261
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:31,020
I'm going to...

262
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:35,020
This is the only way to give a huge nukon to an angel!

263
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,020
My sweet marmalade.

264
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,020
I will give a huge nukon to the Riverside Festival in Tokyo

265
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:44,020
and give it to the God, the only right thing to do!

266
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,020
What are you doing, my sister?

267
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,020
Corset!

268
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,020
Who did this?

269
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:52,020
Who do you think did this?

270
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:55,020
I think the reason Corset lost to the angels is...

271
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:56,020
Shut up!

272
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:59,020
This is not the time to fight!

273
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,020
If this continues, the city will be destroyed by Hell Gate!

274
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,020
That's right, demons!

275
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:10,020
Now is the time to fight and focus on only using this nukon!

276
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,020
Shut up!

277
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,020
You humans, carry it!

278
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,020
Rush!

279
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,020
Demon's rush!

280
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:18,020
Rush!

281
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:20,020
Rush!

282
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:22,020
Rush!

283
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:24,020
Rush!

284
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:28,020
Without your touch

285
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:34,020
Rush!

286
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,020
Gata, everyone!

287
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,020
Wow!

288
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,020
The soldiers are rolling in a row!

289
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,020
I'm going to die!

290
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,020
Bantie...

291
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,020
I...

292
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:03,020
I can't lose to you with this treasure!

293
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:10,020
Bantie...

294
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:14,020
Bantie...

295
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:20,020
Bantie!

296
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:28,020
Bantie!

297
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,020
Take this!

298
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,020
Wow! What's that?

299
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,020
Black Bugger, Shining Fashista!

300
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:43,020
Fly away now!

301
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:45,020
Fly away now!

302
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:47,020
Fly away!

303
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:51,020
In the middle of the world

304
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,020
Bantie!

305
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:55,020
Even if you get lost

306
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,020
Don't give up

307
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,020
Bantie!

308
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,020
This is it!

309
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:07,020
My favorite Bantie!

310
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,020
Hurry up!

311
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:10,020
Rush!

312
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,020
Bantie!

313
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,020
I want to live!

314
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,020
Stop the poison!

315
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,020
I'll eat you!

316
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:23,020
Bantie!

317
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,020
Die!

318
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:31,020
You're so cruel!

319
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,020
You made me

320
00:16:33,020 --> 00:16:38,020
A piece of my body!

321
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,020
This time

322
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,020
I'll...

323
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,020
I'll give you

324
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:55,020
The Kazaana 660 lot!

325
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,020
What are you doing, Bantie?

326
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,020
This isn't the time to fight!

327
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,020
It seems that the biggest

328
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:09,020
Bicchi sisters' quarrel has begun.

329
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,020
At this rate

330
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,020
The Gatestie and this land will be destroyed!

331
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,020
What should I do?

332
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:24,020
I was looking forward to the end of the world!

333
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,020
My pudding!

334
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:29,020
Don't eat it!

335
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,020
I'm going to kill you!

336
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,020
You don't know this!

337
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:42,020
This is my favorite vibe!

338
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:46,020
I'm going to eat you!

339
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,020
Hey!

340
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,020
This is it!

341
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,020
I'll give you

342
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:56,020
The Kazaana 660 lot!

343
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:59,020
Give me back the Gatestie!

344
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:02,020
You're so mean, Bicchi!

345
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:04,020
You're the one who's meaner!

346
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,020
You're the one who's meaner!

347
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,020
You're so mean!

348
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:11,020
Ultra Super!

349
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,020
Gensho B!

350
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,020
No, Bantie!

351
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:21,020
If you do that, you'll die!

352
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:26,020
You're so mean, Bicchi!

353
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:29,020
You're so mean, Bicchi!

354
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:34,020
You're so mean, Bicchi!

355
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:38,020
Enough!

356
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,020
You're hiding and you're not coming out!

357
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,020
Stop it!

358
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:47,020
You're so mean, Bantie!

359
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,020
You're so mean, Bantie!

360
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,020
You're so mean, Bantie!

361
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,020
You're so mean, Bantie!

362
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,020
Shut up!

363
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:03,020
You're the one who's mean!

364
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:05,020
Look, Bleef.

365
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:07,020
You think you're the best Bicchi ever?

366
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:09,020
Yeah, this is Bicchi!

367
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:12,020
My favorite Bantie!

368
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:14,020
The effect of the medicine is gone.

369
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,020
It's gone!

370
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,020
You're so mean, Bicchi!

371
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:32,020
How long are you going to keep doing this?

372
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,020
It's time to go home!

373
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,020
What?

374
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,020
Listen, Garter.

375
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,020
Bantie is going to pull out my hair.

376
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,020
What's wrong with that?

377
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:43,020
It's just hair.

378
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:49,020
Oh, no!

379
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,020
I was going to have a high-at-milk bungee-sex with Cephryd on 3rd Street today!

380
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,020
Oh, no!

381
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,020
I was going to go to the 8DX theater for the revival 4K Ultimate version,

382
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
which is a lot of people are looking forward to.

383
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:01,020
Garter, I don't need your hair today.

384
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,020
Me, neither.

385
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:06,020
Soking, I'm going to pass by the theater.

386
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:07,020
Thank you.

387
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,020
You're a big help, Bantie.

388
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:11,020
I'm going to skip the movie.

389
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,020
Go, Cephryd, go!

390
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,020
Oh, no!

391
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,020
I'm so sorry!

392
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,020
I'm going home!

393
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:24,020
Sister, we're going home.

394
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,020
We're so sorry.

395
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:30,020
I'm going to help the angels, even if it's just for a little while.

396
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:32,020
Are you coming?

397
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,020
Oh, no!

398
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:36,020
Devils, come to my house.

399
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,020
I'm going to change my plan and make a plan.

400
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,020
I want to ride it if I'm going home.

401
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,020
And it's my way home.

402
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,020
Are you okay?

403
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,020
The devil who has the same body as me is already a family.

404
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,020
I see.

405
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,020
You too.

406
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,020
Are you okay?

407
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,020
It's going to be lively again.

408
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,020
I almost died.

409
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,020
I'm so sorry.

410
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:15,020
I'm so sorry.

411
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,020
The angel sisters returned to Latin City.

412
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:21,020
The devil sisters also came.

413
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:26,020
Let's hear the angels' names that are still echoing in the city of the devil and the gods.

414
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:30,020
Let's hear the angels' names that are still echoing in the city of the devil and the gods.

415
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,020
Bantie and Stocking.

416
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:35,020
Bantie and Stocking.

417
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,020
Bantie and Stocking.

418
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:45,020
Bantie and Stocking. Homecoming.

419
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:10,020
I woke up, came with the same ringlet.

420
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:15,020
Jump into this mass, no exit yet.

421
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:18,020
And it's most amazing for the boss.

422
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,020
But that's the truth, the truth is in my heart.

423
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:25,020
I'm a sadist, I wear it like a crown.

424
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:28,020
I crash up and I laugh out loud.

425
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

426
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,020
I'm a blacklist.

427
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
Yeah, I know it's true.

428
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,020
But it's the madness that gets me through.

429
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:40,020
I hope that's the truth for me.

430
00:22:40,020 --> 00:22:42,020
I promise all.

431
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:44,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

432
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:46,020
They think they know me.

433
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
But that's the old me.

434
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,020
Used to control me.

435
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:52,020
But now they moldy.

436
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,020
Yup, committed and I did it.

437
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:56,020
And you labor me a minute, then a billion, cause you can't get with it.

438
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,020
Hate my presence, hate my business.

439
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:00,020
Got no feelings, good riddance.

440
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:02,020
I'm a blacklist.

441
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,020
Yeah, I know it's true.

442
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,020
But it's the madness that gets me through.

443
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,020
I hope that's the truth for me.

444
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,020
I promise all.

445
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,020
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

446
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:24,020
Yes.

447
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:29,020
As you requested, the plan is in order.

448
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Yes.

449
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:33,020
I'll leave it all to this garter belt.

450
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:35,020
Of course.

451
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:37,020
I thought I was in danger.

452
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:39,020
King of the underworld.
