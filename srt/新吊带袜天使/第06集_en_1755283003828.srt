00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,420
when you go

34
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,800
she's

36
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,880
Brif, I'm going out again.

37
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,420
What's up with that geek goal?

38
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,060
Huh? Oh, it's the same club's friend.

39
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:02,600
What's his name?

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,800
Oh, you're pretty good at finding out, Mr. Fools' Angel.

41
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,020
What?

42
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,360
Listen up. The rules are simple.

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,600
It's a game to see who gets more coins.

44
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,100
The loser gets the more coins.

45
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,320
I was just hoping.

46
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,160
Don't regret what you said.

47
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,740
Here I go!

48
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,300
No!

49
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
No!

50
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,300
No!

51
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,300
No!

52
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,300
Huh?

53
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,800
Oh, I'm getting more and more coins.

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,300
What nail should I get next?

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,300
Huh?

56
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,300
Please don't miss this!

57
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:43,300
I've been dreaming of getting a haircut for seven years.

58
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,300
I'm a ghost of a cicada who died in the middle of nowhere.

59
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,800
Seven years? Really?

60
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,300
No sex, no life.

61
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,300
I can't help it.

62
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,300
I'll let you miss it, so hurry up and do it.

63
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,300
I won't forget this sound until I die!

64
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:01,300
What's this? It's so bright!

65
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,300
You can't be pitiful for heaven.

66
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,300
You can't miss ghosts without killing them.

67
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,300
You can't do that, either way.

68
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,300
Who are you guys?

69
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:12,300
My name is Angel Polyester.

70
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,300
Your skin is so bright!

71
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,300
My name is Angel Polyurethane.

72
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:44,920
From today, we're going to be entrusted with the

73
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:54,920
Heaven's license to allow angels to work on the ground.

74
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:55,920
License?

75
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
I don't have a name.

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,920
This is it.

77
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,920
Guard!

78
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,920
I've kept it safe in the fridge because I can't lose it.

79
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,920
I can't give you something so precious that you've only just met!

80
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,920
That's right!

81
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,920
Polyester... Polyurethane?

82
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,920
This kid is the brother of Papa's little brother, Kusogaki!

83
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,920
Papa's little brother?

84
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:22,920
That Rummy guy and that flowery kid are such a cute, handsome guy?

85
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
Oh, wow!

86
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,920
He's got a better memory than I thought.

87
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,920
Rummy?

88
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,920
What?

89
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,920
That Rummy, the Director of the Imperial Academy of the Imperial Academy of the Imperial Palace?

90
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:36,920
That means these two are the sons of the Imperial Enforcer who holds a lot of power!

91
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Now, please accept this!

92
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,920
This is the Heaven's license to allow you to work on the ground!

93
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Hey!

94
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,920
Thanks.

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,920
Old man in pink.

96
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,920
What are you doing?

97
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:50,920
With this license, you're no longer a part of the game.

98
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:56,920
In other words, you don't have the right to deal with ghosts on the ground anymore.

99
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
I'm shooting at you, Rummy.

100
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
You're not supposed to waste bullets.

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,920
What?

102
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:11,920
You're aiming for the moment when ghosts will appear?

103
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:19,920
We're starting to understand where ghosts will appear in this Ghost Vision Pro Max.

104
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,920
Now, shoot!

105
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,920
Well done!

106
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:30,920
Rummy, the power of the Heaven's license, is doing a great job!

107
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,920
What's with that ghost-like sex?

108
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,920
Give it to us too!

109
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,920
It seems that the times have changed while you guys are playing around and enjoying ghost-like sex.

110
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,920
You guys should retire and spend your time in this city that's like a dump for the rest of your lives.

111
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:51,920
You guys are so full of yourselves!

112
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:57,920
What's this?

113
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,920
Damn it, I can't get it back.

114
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,920
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:05,920
We've got a protective suit on, so we can't use that old-fashioned weapon anymore.

116
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,920
A huge car is coming!

117
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,920
It's a double Roll-Rider.

118
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,920
It's our favorite car.

119
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,920
Rummy's skill is indeed great.

120
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,920
It's a new generation of Roll-Riders.

121
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,920
I can't believe we're seeing the face of the angel of the Heaven's license.

122
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,920
It's exactly what you said.

123
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,920
But the angel of the Heaven's license is very unhappy.

124
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,920
As you said, Mr. Misaki.

125
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:33,920
The one who has the power and the power to put pressure on others is the same monster as the devil.

126
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,920
It's a killer!

127
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:38,920
What? What are you talking about?

128
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,920
Look at me, I'm a demon.

129
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,920
You should dress up like a demon.

130
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,920
I'm going to die!

131
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,920
I can handle this. I can definitely handle this.

132
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,920
That was a terrible fight.

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,920
I can handle this.

134
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,920
I'm going to use the ghost.

135
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,920
I'm going to use the ghost.

136
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,920
You're a good guy, Mr. Misaki.

137
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,920
What's going on here?

138
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,920
You guys are serious.

139
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,920
Oh, the angel class is over.

140
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,920
Then we're going home.

141
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,920
I can't do any more school work.

142
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,920
I think it's time to go home.

143
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,920
We're taking care of ourselves.

144
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,920
Thank you for your hard work.

145
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,920
As expected of Mr. Rummy's punishment.

146
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,920
I'm going to go home.

147
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

148
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,920
I'm going to kill you all.

149
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,920
You little kids with a chemical face.

150
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,920
You're all power-loving idiots.

151
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm tired of you, kid.

152
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:47,920
You're not giving us our license.

153
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,920
I'm going to beat you up in the fridge.

154
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,920
I have to do something about this first.

155
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,920
Hey, Geek Boy.

156
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,920
I'm going to find the underwear merchant of Sugoude.

157
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Sugoude, space, underwear, space, merchant of weapons.

158
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,920
I wonder if it's that easy to find.

159
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,920
What's this suspicious ad?

160
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,920
This is definitely something I shouldn't press.

161
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,920
The button is too small.

162
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,920
I did it!

163
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:12,920
What?

164
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
Sugoude, the underwear merchant of weapons,

165
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,920
I leave you to the bottom of the sea.

166
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,920
I leave you to the bottom of the sea,

167
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Tantrum Dimension.

168
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:25,920
Here it is!

169
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,920
The underwear merchant's house?

170
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,920
That's not normal.

171
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,920
I'll be careful.

172
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Hey, open it!

173
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:34,920
Don't use the door!

174
00:08:34,920 --> 00:08:35,920
Hey, you!

175
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:36,920
Hey, Brief.

176
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:37,920
Hey, Brief.

177
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
You're the Geek Girl from before.

178
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Why are you here?

179
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,920
Why?

180
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,920
This is my house, Gansu.

181
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:45,920
What?

182
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,920
This is not the Gansu Mitzvitz shop at the underwear merchant of Sugoude?

183
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,920
Oh, you're a customer, Gansu.

184
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,920
This is the place, so come in.

185
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,920
So, where is Gansu Mitzvitz?

186
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Where?

187
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
It's right here, Gansu.

188
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
I'm the Gansu Mitzvitz!

189
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,920
What?

190
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,920
Why are you pretending to be a geek?

191
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
I'm not pretending.

192
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,920
I'm the real me.

193
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:09,920
So, Gansu,

194
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,920
living with just one character in this era is a tough job.

195
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,920
It's easy to make your own place in various places.

196
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,920
You're busy with visuals,

197
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:20,920
so I can't hear you at all.

198
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:21,920
Makoto, it's okay.

199
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Hurry up and get your hands on it.

200
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,920
Okay!

201
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
I'm going to get my hands on it.

202
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Wow!

203
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,920
Wow!

204
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
Wow!

205
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,920
What is this place?

206
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
This is the Pants Dimension.

207
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,920
Pants Dimension.

208
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Yes!

209
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,920
Here, you can learn, develop, and sell

210
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,920
the technology to transform your underwear into weapons.

211
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,920
You can do it on your own.

212
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Hey, you!

213
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
You're not supposed to be here!

214
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:51,920
I'm not here!

215
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,920
I'm here!

216
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
I'm here!

217
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,920
I'm here!

218
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,920
That fucking Chemical Angel Brothers

219
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,920
is using our development weapons to transform their underwear.

220
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Can you take this off?

221
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
Of course!

222
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,920
I can afford it.

223
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Then, take off the limit,

224
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:07,920
and put on all of these.

225
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
I'll put on this, that, and that.

226
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,920
That's fine, but do you have money?

227
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,920
What?

228
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
If you buy all of that, you'll get this.

229
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:15,920
What?

230
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,920
I'm not interested in that.

231
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
All right!

232
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
Now I'm going to stick it on my body.

233
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,920
I'm going to use my Heaven Finger, Kamiteku,

234
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
to make you my main character.

235
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
Don't touch my vagina with your dirty hands, you bitch!

236
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
This is...

237
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
Iron Fist Kick, Middle Ribbon Spear,

238
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,920
Electro-Transformers, Back Racer!

239
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,920
This is better than your finger!

240
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,920
What?

241
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,920
Hey!

242
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,920
I'm going to use my protectors!

243
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,920
enemies

244
00:10:51,920 --> 00:11:06,920
got

245
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,520
Alright, wait up, you little brats!

246
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,320
So, where do we go?

247
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,320
To the hospital?

248
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,080
My stomach hurts! My stomach hurts!

249
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,800
What's going on?

250
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,520
How could you do something like that?

251
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,480
T-This is the job of an angel with a tradition!

252
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:35,120
Why don't you girls follow the angel's tradition a little?

253
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,320
You're not supposed to do anything like this,

254
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,600
and then just go around naked,

255
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,360
and do something stupid like that!

256
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,040
You can't even die!

257
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
Look at this!

258
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,840
This is the best!

259
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:46,040
If you post this on the internet, it'll definitely go viral!

260
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,240
As expected of the old man!

261
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,440
What a ridiculous secret!

262
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,320
This is...

263
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,120
Anti-Cravity Mount!

264
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,480
Where did you get that?

265
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,120
We know more about this town than anyone else in the world.

266
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,920
It's some kind of illegal equipment.

267
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,200
Either way, I'll report to the higher-ups.

268
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,400
Let's have a match.

269
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:11,040
The one who kills the ghosts more often wins.

270
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,000
The winner will have the right to kill the ghosts in this town.

271
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,400
Or maybe we should go to the old man from the other side.

272
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,600
Can't we just decide who's second?

273
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:23,360
That match will be decided either way.

274
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,880
I think we should let the other girls who are confused understand.

275
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,680
It's ridiculous!

276
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,240
The goal is the church.

277
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,960
The one who kills the ghosts more often wins.

278
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,000
Okay, baby!

279
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,200
Ready...

280
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:45,920
Set...

281
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,920
Go!

282
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,840
This is...

283
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,240
There's no ghost!

284
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,160
No.

285
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,480
Either way, it's a lot easier!

286
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,720
You girls are in the lead!

287
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,320
That's so unfair!

288
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,520
Damn it! Is there no one else?

289
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,120
Maybe it's a bonus!

290
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,560
He's good!

291
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,160
Start the counterattack!

292
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,760
It wasn't in the town.

293
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,280
This is what happened?

294
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,000
But...

295
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,880
That's a big deal!

296
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,320
You're in the lead!

297
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,160
Myなる unlucky!

298
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,640
I can't believe you're at the mercy of the illegal equipment again.

299
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:35,680
It's about time we ended things!

300
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,800
Either way,

301
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,000
This is really going to be intense!

302
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,040
brimming with confusion amidst the universe

303
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,160
Hey, hey! Dwarf然n von serenity!

304
00:13:57,320 --> 00:14:01,820
The path of fire, we light the way, the way

305
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,820
Nobody's turning, we're here to stay

306
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,820
Together we stand

307
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,820
With the wings of the stone and the armor

308
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,820
We're the fighters and the angels

309
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,820
We're the fighters and the angels

310
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:22,820
We are the fire, fire, fire

311
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:26,820
Define, define, define

312
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,320
We're the fire, fire, fire

313
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,320
Oh, I wish I could borrow Akuma's hand.

314
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,320
The angels are also a bit of a loser.

315
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,320
I don't know if I'm at the end of the game or not.

316
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,320
I feel like we've won too much.

317
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,320
I feel like I'm not even sorry.

318
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Huh? What?

319
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:19,320
Akuma!

320
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,320
Die, Bakken Brothers!

321
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:26,320
Huh? So you're going to beat us?

322
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,320
I want to fight!

323
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,320
We're split into two!

324
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,320
We've been transformed!

325
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,320
You dirty bastards!

326
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,320
I'm done!

327
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,320
It's a violation of the development law to have angels and demons in common.

328
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:12,320
I've never heard of the development rule.

329
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,320
Either way, I'm a bitch, so I don't want to be tied up.

330
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,320
Dad, it's time for dinner.

331
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I'm going to beat you up!

332
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,320
What's that?

333
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,320
That's...

334
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:21,320
By killing a large number of ghosts in a short period of time,

335
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,320
the ghosts who were inspired by the fear of ghosts gathered

336
00:17:24,320 --> 00:17:27,320
and trying to become huge ghosts.

337
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,320
What?

338
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,320
It's a big deal.

339
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,320
But the amount of coins is almost the same as the amount of the five.

340
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:38,320
It seems that this rule is the one that won the one who put that lump in first.

341
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,320
That's what I mean.

342
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:43,320
I don't want to be tied up with those guys.

343
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,320
I really don't want to be tied up with them.

344
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,320
I don't want to be tied up with them.

345
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,320
I don't want to be tied up with them.

346
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,320
I don't want to be tied up with them.

347
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,320
I don't want to be tied up with them.

348
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,320
Yes, Zunder.

349
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
Yes, it's over.

350
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,320
Hey, guys!

351
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,320
We're buying new products from the online store.

352
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,320
What's that?

353
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,320
That's the Double Triple Sextuple Heaven's Big Cannon.

354
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,320
I'll kill you if you do that.

355
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,320
We're going to buy some weapons for the Demon Realm.

356
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,320
We're running out of gas.

357
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,320
This isn't it. This isn't it. This isn't it.

358
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,320
It's empty.

359
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,320
What do you want?

360
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,320
You!

361
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,320
You, the one who wants additional power!

362
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,320
You can buy it on the normal three times the price now.

363
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,320
I don't care, just give me the money.

364
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,320
Let's do it!

365
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,320
One-on-one, Demon Realm!

366
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,320
Okay!

00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:46,320
The angel of the Holy Double who descends from the heavens and heals the earth.

370
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,320
The evil double demon who rules the earth from the darkness.

371
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:09,320
The devil who wanders the earth, who has lost his place in both heaven and darkness.

I did it!

391
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,320
This is a lie!

392
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,320
Either way...

393
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,320
Either way...

394
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,320

395
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,320
What are you guys doing?!

396
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,320

00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,320
Panty Stocking!

399
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:53,320
I'm sorry for the trouble my sons have caused you guys to cause.

400
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:57,320
I'm sorry for causing you guys trouble by causing a riot on the ground.

401
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,320
No, it's okay, Uncle.

402
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,320
They did it!

403
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,320
Hey, hey!

404
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:04,320
Panty and Stocking are the daughters of the king of the Heavens!

405
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
You are the sons of the king's younger brother!

406
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,320
You have different positions!

407
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:12,320
And you shouldn't waste your time buying these toys!

408
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,320
Panty Stocking!

409
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,320
I'll handle the court decision of the Heavens Court and I'll return Heavens License to you!

410
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,320
So, will you take a look at this?

411
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,320
I guess not.

412
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,320
Of course!

413
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:29,320
I'll see you again!

414
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,320
Take care, Panty Stocking!

415
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,320
See you later!

416
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,320
Bye bye, Uncle!

417
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,320
You are indeed the hands of the gods.

418
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,320
God Hand!

419
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,320
It looks like he's done.

420
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:43,320
If that's the case, let's go with this guy tonight!

421
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
Hello!

422
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,320
I'm here to get the payment for the equipment!

423
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
Here's the receipt.

424
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,320
I'll be waiting for your return!

425
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,320
Thank you!

426
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,320
Park!

427
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Wait up, you thief!

428
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
You're so mean!

429
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
You forgot that we have a loan?

430
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,320
The hands of the loaned demon are expensive.

431
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,320
Today's a peaceful day.

432
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,320
You were whining and whining all day long!

433
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,320
I should have just let you stay as a horse.

434
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,320
You're so mean!

435
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,320

But it's the madness that gets me through.
