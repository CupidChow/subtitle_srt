CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,423
Move it, will you?

3
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,428
Jeez, it was a bad idea
to pass through here around this time.

4
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:42,310
If you're headed for Yeoksam-dong,
Samseong-dong, or Dogok-dong,

5
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,062
turn around right now.

6
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,856
The streets around Nokeun-ro are jammed

7
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,359
with cars of parents
picking up their children

8
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,945
after their private classes.

9
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:54,948
As congestion is expected,
consider taking a detour.

YOU AND I, THE INTERSECTION OF
TWO UNIVERSES

12
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:45,039
EPISODE 1

13
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:49,586
Welcome to the Gangnam academy district,
Korea's private education mecca.

14
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,130
Lining up for front-row seats
in star teachers' classes

15
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:53,882
are not students, but their parents.

16
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:57,719
Sometimes not even the parents,
but people hired by them.

17
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:01,097
This sad reality shows how far
parents would go for their kids' studies.

18
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,641
Excuse me. No cutting in line, please.

19
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,310
No one's cutting in line.

20
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:06,352
I saw you do it.

21
00:03:06,436 --> 00:03:10,273
-You cut after exchanging looks with her!
-I went to use the bathroom.

22
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:13,568
-But it's inside the building!
-There's one there too.

23
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,487
-How can you be so shameless?
-Stop pointing fingers.

24
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,114
That's right.

25
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:21,117
Who in the world called Korea
the Land of the Morning Calm?

26
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,620
Our day starts early.

27
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:26,164
We raise our voices before daybreak.

28
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,792
We already feel worn out
as we begin our day,

29
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,503
but we keep plugging away,
believing in "no pain, no gain."

30
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:35,006
We pursue higher income,
education, and grades,

31
00:03:36,132 --> 00:03:37,967
in order to enter high society.

32
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,347
That's where Korea stands today.

33
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,560
Are you thinking,
"Who are you to be so cynical?"

34
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:48,686
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

35
00:03:48,770 --> 00:03:51,189
I'm a former member
of the national handball team

36
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,524
and current owner
of Nation's Best Banchan.

37
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:54,692
I'm Nam Haeng-seon.

FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

40
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:08,373
My mornings are busy
for a different reason.

41
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,043
It's for myself
and the happiness of my family.

42
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,419
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

43
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,014

44
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,183
Oh, my.

45
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:33,898
Goodness, his eye.

46
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,109
Shoot, what do I do?

47
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:47,912
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

48
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,790
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

49
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,595
So? What did you do?

50
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:07,724
What else?
I treated the wounds as best as I could.

51
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,477
You could've hurt yourself really badly.

52
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,272
Didn't I tell you not to ride
your scooter too fast?

53
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,025
Be careful. You can't afford to get hurt.

54
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,152
I wasn't riding it too fast.

55
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:22,530
That woman came out of nowhere,
and I turned instinctively.

56
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:25,241
-I blame--
-It's been a while.

57
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,159
Welcome.

58
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,203
-You dyed your hair?
-Can you tell?

59
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,955
You're better than my husband.

60
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,457
-It looks great.
-My goodness.

61
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,500
-Take your time.
-Okay, I will.

62
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,378
I blame that line outside the academy.

63
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,339
Line? What line?

64
00:05:39,422 --> 00:05:42,050
Moms line up every day
to get their kids good seats.

65
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:43,342
Oh, that.

66
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,928
I really don't understand.

67
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,015
Lining up to get front-row seats
for a mere academy class?

68
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:51,267
In this age
of the Fourth Industrial Revolution?

69
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,437
Have you been watching
a lot of current affairs programs?

70
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,939
What's the Fourth Industrial Revolution?

71
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,234
You know…

72
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:02,612
It's the fourth…

73
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,697
It's the fourth revolution…

74
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:10,495
Anyway, I blame the moms
for the private education fad.

75
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,871
They're taking it too far.

76
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:14,082
Enthusiasm grows and turns into obsession,

77
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,708
leading to competition.

78
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:17,418
You have a point there. I agree.

79
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,922
They line up early in the morning
to sign up for a star teacher's course.

80
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:21,923
Isn't that absurd?

81
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,509
A star teacher? What's that?

82
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,719
Is there a moon teacher too?

83
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,429
I can't believe you.

84
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,058
How can you not know that
after all these years in this area?

85
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,103
Star teacher means
the most popular teacher in each subject.

86
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,315
They're the BTS of private education.
Get it?

87
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,945
For math, Choi Chi-yeol.

88
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,952
That was amazing,

89
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,413
but how about we try a dance version?

90
00:07:35,496 --> 00:07:36,706
With big moves.

91
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:38,416
A dance version?

92
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,377
Let's make it quick.

93
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,754
Sir, your signature pose.

94
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,007
The one you do during class.

95
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,802
-This?
-Yes, that kick.

96
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,262
Be sure to incorporate that.

97
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,430
It's a must.

98
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,891
Then what about this?

99
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,809
Mr. Choi.

100
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:58,853
That'd be awesome.

101
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,271
Let's roll.

102
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,645
For math,

103
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:42,522
Choi Chi-yeol.

104
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,028
That was incredible.

105
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:50,613
Let me check what we just filmed.

106
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,368
-It's up.
-It is?

107
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,161
Then let's get going.

108
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:00,665
Mr. Choi! Sir!

109
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,501
It turned out pretty well,

110
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,296
but if you could kick
just a little higher this time--

111
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,465
I was told the shoot
would take three hours.

112
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:11,509
Yes, it was supposed to.

113
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,887
But we can do better.
It'll take just ten minutes.

114
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:17,557
-Ten minutes?
-No more.

115
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,768
Do you know what my nickname is?

116
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:22,144
I'm not sure.

117
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,313
God of Math.

118
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,733
I know. The Star.

119
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,821
-…of the Stars.
-Wrong.

120
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:33,823
The Trillion Won Man.

121
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:37,535
Offline and online classes,
publishing, plus value added.

122
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:40,121
I create a value
of one trillion won each year.

123
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,373
Then how much is ten minutes worth?

124
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,459
Divide 1 trillion by 365,
and it's 2.7 billion a day.

125
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:46,794
That's 100 million an hour.

126
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,422
Therefore, 10 minutes of my time
is worth 17 million won.

127
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,508
Can you wire me 17 million?

128
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,929
-Well…
-I hate unpaid overtime.

129
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,598
-Let's go.
-Wait--

130
00:10:00,266 --> 00:10:03,728
The June mock exam was today,
so he's more on edge than usual.

131
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:04,979
I apologize.

132
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:05,938
Wait…

133
00:10:12,236 --> 00:10:14,071
There were many sequence questions.

134
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:17,283
And some make-or-break
semi-killer questions.

135
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,410
The standard score will go up
by at least ten.

136
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,328
Number 19.

137
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:22,705
It's on shapes.

138
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:25,041
The kids must have panicked.

139
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:28,878
Why?

140
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,464
It's just as I warned them
during class last Tuesday.

141
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:35,426
Tough trigonometric functions questions
and killer shapes questions.

142
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,346
Did I not emphasize it enough?

143
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,889
No, I missed it. It's just me.

144
00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:41,682
Yes, it is.

145
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,060
Gosh, I really hope it's just you.

146
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,312
But what if it's not
and the kids missed it too?

147
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,815
That's impossible.
I'm sure they made a mental note.

148
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,526
Can you say that three more times?

149
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:53,527
I feel anxious.

150
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,322
They made a mental note.

151
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,657
Good.

152
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,700
That gives me confidence.

153
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:05,956
MATH SECTION

154
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,000
"On the graph of the cubic function y=f(x)

155
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,044
where the leading coefficient
is minus two…"

156
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:13,464
Why did Director Kang schedule the shoot
on the day of the June mock?

157
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,757
What time is it?

158
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,008
It's 5:58 p.m., sir.

159
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,261
I mean the live review session.
It's scheduled for 6:30 p.m., right?

160
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,262
Yes, sir.

161
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:22,973
Hi. What's up?

162
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:25,893
Really?

163
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,269
Okay. Send me the link.

164
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:29,897
-Sir.
-Yes?

165
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,858
Song Jun-ho at Perfect M
has started his live review session.

166
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,070
Who? Song Jun-ho?

167
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,905
The self-proclaimed rising star?

168
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,365
The one dying to get me?

169
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,076
Yes. Check the link.

170
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:45,162
It's not a big deal.
He can start his session before me.

171
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:49,625
But still,

172
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,378
it's quite brazen of him, isn't it?

173
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,463
He's openly challenging me.

174
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,049
By sneakily starting 30 minutes early.

175
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,472
Let me see.

176
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:09,520
Let's start our review session

177
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:11,772
for the 2023 June mock exam.

178
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,732
I'm your math teacher, Song Jun-ho.

179
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,359
-Step on it.
-Pardon?

180
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,194
Drive me to the academy fast.

181
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:19,905
Tell the team I'm going live
as soon as I arrive.

182
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,282
Tell what's-his-name…

183
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,284
The round-faced guy with glasses.

184
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,869
Tell him to get the camera ready.

185
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,871
And the one eating bread all the time.

186
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,415
Tell her to print
the question analysis slides.

187
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,835
Now, step on it.

188
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:46,974
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

189
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:51,896
-Hello, sir.
-How far has he gotten?

190
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:53,230
He's on question five.

191
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,649
What? He's barely done anything.

192
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,234
-Is the camera ready?
-Yes, sir!

193
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,695
-Hey kid, get me the exam papers.
-Okay.

194
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,989
Keep an eye on Song Jun-ho, kid.

195
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:02,948
Yes, sir.

196
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:04,950
And cut these!

197
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:08,204
Print them out, kid.

198
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,788
It's a race against time.

199
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,791
How can he still call me kid?
I've worked here for over a year.

200
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,211
He's not interested in anything but work.

201
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:18,047
I've been here for three years,
but he still forgets my name.

202
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:23,469
Choi Chi-yeol is live.

203
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,054
Good job, everyone.

204
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,139
It was one heck of an exam, right?

205
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,850
Stop crying. BIUY.
You brought it upon yourself.

206
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:32,436
I started early
because I thought you'd be panicking.

207
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,938
Let's cut to the chase.

208
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:36,315
Question number one. Let's go.

209
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,401
2023 JUNE MOCK EXAM
LIVE MATH REVIEW SESSION

210
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,319
Question one.

211
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:42,655
It's the most basic form
of an exponents question.

212
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,448
To multiply these two,

213
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,076
add the exponents up.

214
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,327
Then what do you get?

215
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,371
Two to the power of four.

216
00:13:50,454 --> 00:13:52,623
So the correct answer is 16.

217
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,999
Easy-peasy. Next.

218
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,211
The average of the roots is pi.

219
00:13:57,294 --> 00:14:00,422
Logarithmic functions and
exponential functions are inverses.

220
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:06,595
Since the slope of the line is two,
the run is one, and the rise is two.

221
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,140
Since B and C are inverses,
what are the coordinates?

222
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,058
B is…

223
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,478
If it's smaller than p,
we're going to use the upper formula.

224
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:15,563
If it's larger than p…

225
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,481
Hey, let's switch to Choi Chi-yeol.

226
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:18,524
Sounds good.

227
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:22,444
SUM OF LOGARITHMS

228
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,531
I'M A FAN, MR. CHOI

229
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:26,448
HURRY UP, MR. SONG

230
00:14:26,532 --> 00:14:27,408
YOU ROCK, MR. CHOI

231
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,868
There you go.

232
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:32,913
-Since the number of terms is 21…
-Let's see here.

233
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:34,248
I GET IT NOW

234
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:38,002
-…2m plus 1 plus l
-If you list the terms…

235
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,837
equals 21.

236
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,256
-If we substitute l
-Since we don't know what p is…

237
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:45,259
with 20 minus 2m,

238
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,012
and put it into the equation, m equals

239
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:49,722
six.

240
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,348
Give me just a second.

241
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,433
SWITCHING TO CHI-YEOL!

242
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,601
ADIOS, SONG JUN-HO

243
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:54,852
Let's try that again.

244
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,646
So let's find out what p is.

245
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,859
As you can see, p equals 32.

246
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,488
Done.

247
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:10,868
So,

248
00:15:11,619 --> 00:15:13,662
he made a mistake
solving the killer question?

249
00:15:14,163 --> 00:15:16,832
It wasn't just a mistake.
He threw in the towel.

250
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,752
Why did he go live
without solving the questions first?

251
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:24,131
Even a piano player can mess up
if they play and sing at the same time.

252
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:26,884
You see, I'm an exception.

253
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,844
Mr. Ji.

254
00:15:29,511 --> 00:15:30,471
Dong-hui.

255
00:15:30,554 --> 00:15:34,183
I'm an exception,
and I still barely manage it.

256
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,813
Good work, sir.

257
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:41,982
Really? A crushing victory?

258
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:46,111
I'm not surprised.
He's the ace of The Pride.

259
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,864
Director Cha will have to eat humble pie

260
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:50,658
after challenging us so confidently.

261
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:55,496
Anyway, distribute the edited video
and start promoting.

262
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,165
Let Season 2 be another great success.

263
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,672
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

264
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,718
I totally screwed up the June mock.

265
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,722
It's still too cold
to jump into the Han River, right?

266
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,349
Probably.

267
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,727
I drew a blank
in the first Language Arts section.

268
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:22,564
How can a Korean
find his native language so difficult?

269
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,234
You're good at math at least.

270
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,569
I suck at it.

271
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,991
I kept taking the wrong approach,
and I ran out of time.

272
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:35,285
My mind went completely blank
when I saw question number 22.

273
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:37,204
Will you not make Level 1?

274
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,206
No. Not a chance.

275
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:40,666
You guys are cruel.

276
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,668
Your friend here is in Level 4!

277
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,294
Hae-e! Nam Hae-e!

278
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:45,838
How did you do?

279
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,382
I totally screwed up.

280
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,342
I missed a four-point question in math.

281
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:52,219
Is that it? Just the one?

282
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:55,723
Yes. But it was worth four points.

283
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,850
I was so close to getting a perfect score.

284
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,851
I'm so upset.

285
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,436
I bet you are.

286
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,188
Seemed like you pulled an all-nighter.

287
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,191
Next time, make sure you're well-rested.

288
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,487
What about you? Did you do well?

289
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,908
Well, I guess I did as usual.

290
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,368
"As usual"?

291
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,163
Seems you spent all your time resting.

292
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,208
Anyway, I admire you.

293
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:26,128
You study on your own
without taking any private classes.

294
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,796
You should write a book later.

295
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,841
"Textbooks are all you need.
Private classes are overrated."

296
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,517
My mom's here. I'll get going.

297
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,727
See you tomorrow!

298
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,482
Bang Su-a, that little…

299
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,108
What if I smack her?

300
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:50,235
Just use your words. I'll hit her for you.

301
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,987
I could beat her to a pulp.

302
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,864
-Just curse her out.
-Should I?

303
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,325
Go ahead. Jeez.

304
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,994
It seems like Sun-jae didn't do that well,

305
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,579
and Hae-e clearly screwed up.

306
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:03,457
Ji-hye in Class 4 messed up English.

307
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:04,458
I see.

308
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,294
I might have scored
the highest in my year.

309
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,046
-Really?
-Yes.

310
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:11,548
Oh, my goodness.

311
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:15,344
Su-a, I'm so happy that I'm going to cry.

312
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:17,679
You're overreacting again.

313
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,015
Cry when I do well on the actual CSAT.

314
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:21,934
You're right.

315
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:24,728
If I celebrate now,
I might jinx it, right?

316
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,105
I'll pull myself together.

317
00:18:30,734 --> 00:18:32,152
By the way, Su-a,

318
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:35,239
I'm sorry to ruin your good mood,

319
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:38,200
but I have bad news.

320
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,118
What is it?

321
00:18:39,201 --> 00:18:41,620
It's all right.
I'm feeling generous today.

322
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,622
It's about the academy.

323
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,084
I couldn't get you a good seat today.

324
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,418
You're further back.

325
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:49,670
Are you crazy?

326
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,422
Then I'll barely be able
to see the teacher!

327
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:55,884
Gosh, seriously.

328
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:01,306
Why is the sky especially blue today?

329
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:03,725
It's so painfully beautiful.

330
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,228
You're right.

331
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:08,480
Beautiful.

332
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,650
Why do you sound so down?

333
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:13,944
You're better off than me.

334
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,321
Come on. Not really.

335
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,991
Med schools are impossible to get into.

336
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,161
I'll probably end up somewhere
outside of Seoul.

337
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,747
Hey.

338
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,458
What do you think is our problem?

339
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:32,588
To be frank, aren't we
pretty hard-working for teenagers?

340
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,965
We never cause trouble or act out.

341
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:38,760
Studying all the time is bad enough.

342
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:41,221
So why do we have to feel so frustrated?

343
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,268
Hey, why don't you…

344
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,396
sign up for Choi Chi-yeol's course?

345
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,608
Su-a hasn't missed Level 1
since she started taking it.

346
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,737
Is he that good?

347
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,822
Well…

348
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:00,824
His offline classes
are definitely helpful.

349
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:02,409
He uses high-quality materials

350
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,995
and tests us before every class,
which is super helpful.

351
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:10,918
I already told my mom
that private classes aren't my thing.

352
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,588
-I see.
-I don't know what to do.

353
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,882
I was okay on my own until 10th grade,

354
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:18,008
but this is my limit.

355
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,805
-Hey.
-Yes?

356
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:27,100
-You have 40 minutes until class, right?
-Yes. Why?

357
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,644
Let's get some fresh air.

358
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:30,187
But I have to get dinner.

359
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,522
That only takes 10 minutes. Spare me 30.

360
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,317
Let's go.

361
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,071
Come on.

362
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,032
Gosh, whatever.

363
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:44,159
Let's run!

364
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,610
What?

365
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:21,405
I held it like this…

366
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:23,198
It went up and then…

367
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,158
Gosh.

368
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:13,123
So?

369
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,500
Did you enjoy our 30-minute bus trip?

370
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,294
Yes, it was nice.

371
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,255
See you.

372
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,216
Study hard, Sun-jae. Don't doze off.

373
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,134
Okay.

374
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,094
Bye.

375
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,938
CHOI CHI-YEOL IS ALL YOU NEED

376
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,346
-Mom.
-Welcome back. Hold this up for me.

377
00:23:11,389 --> 00:23:12,849
You came at the perfect time.

378
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,601
I just received a large order.

379
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:16,478
Can you deliver it?

380
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,815
It's dinnertime soon.
It's a war out there.

381
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,360
Please. I took the mock exam all day.

382
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:27,197
I've been on my feet all day cooking.
Stop complaining, kid.

383
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,741
Go change and tell your uncle
to come downstairs.

384
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:30,742
Hey, Mom.

385
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:35,122
Never mind.

386
00:23:37,332 --> 00:23:38,166
Hey!

387
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:39,960
What about your mock exam?

388
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,712
Did you get 100 percent?

389
00:23:44,756 --> 00:23:45,715
Why not?

390
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:13,201
-Hae-e.
-Gosh, you scared me!

391
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,122
Don't sneak up on me like that,
Uncle Jae-woo.

392
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:18,957
I'm here, Hae-e.

393
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,920
Mom wants you downstairs.

394
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:27,591
By the way, Hae-e,
this is a famous lioness named Mmamoriri.

395
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,426
Strangely, she has a mane.

396
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,511
There's a maned lioness?

397
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,637
Yes.

398
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,724
Some even have a black mane,
the symbol of a pride leader.

399
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:39,352
A male lion with a black mane
usually is the leader of the territory.

400
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:41,938
But this lioness has
high levels of testosterone

401
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:44,107
and even roars like a male.

402
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,151
She reminds me of my sister,
Nam Haeng-seon.

403
00:24:50,906 --> 00:24:53,283
I'm sorry. Am I boring you again?

404
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,784
Are you annoyed? Should I stop?

405
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,830
That's fine,
but we should head downstairs.

406
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,373
Mom must be getting angry.

407
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,250
Okay, but--

408
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,627
Hey, hurry up!

409
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,462
I'm busy! Come downstairs.

410
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,966
I told you.

411
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:24,231
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

412
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,905
THE PRIDE ACADEMY

413
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,617
-Are there enough?
-Yes.

414
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,369
Okay. How's the temperature?

415
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:50,090
Question number 22 was on nth roots,
and it was quite difficult.

416
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,634
It might have made you panic,
but there's no need.

417
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,010
Why?

418
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:56,346
Because you took Choi Chi-yeol's course.

419
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,306
You see a question on nth roots.

420
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:03,061
No need to panic.

421
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,063
You see a question on nth roots.

422
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,735
So it's a question on nth roots?

423
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,445
Just what I've been waiting for.

424
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,780
Lucky me.

425
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,448
I can't possibly get it wrong.

426
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,366
Why?

427
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,952
-Because I took Choi Chi-yeol's course.
-Because I took Choi Chi-yeol's course.

428
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,913
What else comes to mind
when you see this type of question?

429
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:24,582
Anyone?

430
00:26:25,583 --> 00:26:26,835
Really? Nothing?

431
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,253
Seriously?

432
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,673
Gosh, it's all my fault.

433
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,384
I'm to blame
for not teaching you properly.

434
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:37,304
When minors mess up,
it's all the grown-ups' fault.

435
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,598
It is, right?

436
00:26:40,682 --> 00:26:41,599
-No.
-No.

437
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,144
As the grown-up here,
let me teach you again.

438
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,354
To solve this question,

439
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,483
you need to first figure out
whether m is even or odd.

440
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,200
That's the key!

441
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:03,413
Well?

442
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:04,789
Did that wake you up?

443
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,707
Yes.

444
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:07,959
As I always say,

445
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,754
I can put up with students dozing off.

446
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,464
Sure, it's annoying,

447
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,591
but I can let it slide.

448
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,508
Why?

449
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:16,926
Because I feel sorry.

450
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:20,138
Studying from dawn until dusk
is no easy feat.

451
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:22,307
What torture to be
sitting at a desk all day.

452
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:24,601
If you doze off,

453
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:27,354
it means you're battling against yourself.

454
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,647
But taking a full nap in class?

455
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:31,316
It means you've given up.

456
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,736
It means you lost
the battle against yourself

457
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,863
and have zero respect for me.

458
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,031
I find it…

459
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,783
detestable.

460
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:42,952
-Put that there.
-Okay.

461
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,955
Do you have any cheonggukjang?

462
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,374
Yes, right over here.

463
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,750
I'll get it for you.

464
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:51,127
Here you go. Thank you.

465
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,630
There's nothing to even think about.

466
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:55,965
The braised kimchi and mackerel
is the best today.

467
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,885
It's shameless of me
to compliment the food I made,

468
00:27:58,968 --> 00:28:00,345
but it just tastes so good.

469
00:28:00,428 --> 00:28:03,181
You know blue-backed fish
are good for students.

470
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,725
It's high in DHA.

471
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,227
Come on.

472
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,728
Fine, I get it.

473
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:11,231
You never give me a moment to think.

474
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:15,026
But you see,
this lady here doesn't need it.

475
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,237
I mean the DHA.

476
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:20,115
Su-a scored the highest in her year
in the mock exam.

477
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:22,200
We don't know that yet.

478
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,494
Wow, congratulations.

479
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:25,829
That's great news.

480
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,789
-Su-a is incredible.
-I know.

481
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:29,290
Hae-e is amazing too.

482
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,458
Come on.

483
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,794
Also, what counts is
the national percentile rank.

484
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:35,171
Being top of her class
doesn't mean anything.

485
00:28:35,255 --> 00:28:39,050
Still, if she's top of her class,
she's one of the top students

486
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,718
in the country too.

487
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:44,055
And half the credit goes to her.

488
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:45,515
Even on Skymom.net,

489
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:48,143
this lady, Suaimdang's word is the law.

490
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:51,271
All the moms trust her completely.

491
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,188
Why?

492
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:54,774
Because she knows
all the latest news about education.

493
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,277
Stop it. You're embarrassing me.

494
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,278
Fine, it's my treat.

495
00:28:58,361 --> 00:28:59,988
-Pick what you want.
-You're buying?

496
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,198
-Two of these?
-Sure.

497
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,825
-I'll take two.
-Lucky me.

498
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,412
-You're so generous, Su-hui.
-Mackerel is expensive, you know.

499
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,414
You deserve a top student
as your daughter.

500
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,331
Welcome!

501
00:29:10,915 --> 00:29:11,750
-Hello.
-Hi.

502
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,501
-Hello.
-Good to see you.

503
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,754
Are you just getting off work,
Sun-jae's mom?

504
00:29:16,337 --> 00:29:17,672
-Yes.
-You must be busy.

505
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,758
It's so hard to catch a glimpse of you.

506
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:21,092
Of course.

507
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,303
She's an attorney
at Korea's best law firm.

508
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:24,345
You're right.

509
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,514
I'm a "lawyer," not an "attorney."

510
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,517
"Attorney" refers to lawyers
practicing in court.

511
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:32,395
If you're talking about my occupation,
"lawyer" is correct.

512
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:34,439
-Oh, I see.
-Lawyer…

513
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:37,942
Same difference. Tomahto, tomato.

514
00:29:38,693 --> 00:29:41,237
It's "tomato, tomahto,"
not "tomahto, tomato."

515
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,701
Guys, make up your mind.

516
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,621
I need you to make room
for the next customers.

517
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,331
Okay.

518
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:52,540
Choose your items.

519
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,626
Quickly. Take your pick.

520
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,211
Make a decision.

521
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,879
-Give it to me.
-Careful.

522
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,964
-Mom, I dropped off the order.
-Hey.

523
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,090
-Say hello.
-Hello.

524
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,052
-It's been a while, Hae-e.
-You're a good girl, Hae-e.

525
00:30:04,135 --> 00:30:06,304
It's so nice you can help out your mom

526
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,765
since you don't take private classes.

527
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,771
Does Hae-e take after her dad?
She doesn't really look like you.

528
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,147
Don't you agree?

529
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:20,026
What are you talking about?
Everyone says we look alike.

530
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:22,529
Besides, it's Dan-ji
that doesn't take after you.

531
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,864
She looks taller every time I see her.

532
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:25,865
Right?

533
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:29,369
I can't seem to find braised tofu.

534
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,037
-Go home.
-See you.

535
00:30:34,707 --> 00:30:36,209
Thanks, Hae-e.

536
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:37,418
Go back inside.

537
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:39,796
-Where?
-Here…

538
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:45,134
As I always say, don't let
the June mock exam mess with you.

539
00:30:45,718 --> 00:30:47,679
Move on from the June mock.

540
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:50,139
Regret is a waste of time.

541
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,183
-Okay!
-Okay!

542
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:55,603
If you have any questions,
ask my assistants outside.

543
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,064
That's all for today.

544
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:58,982
And I'm…

545
00:30:59,816 --> 00:31:01,192
Choi Chi-yeol.

546
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,987
Bye, guys.

547
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,246
-Good work, sir.
-Good work, sir.

548
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,290
Mr. Choi!

549
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:29,178
-Mr. Choi!
-Mr. Choi!

550
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,015
I only got five questions wrong.

551
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,725
-Good job.
-Your hair looks amazing!

552
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:34,976
-Thanks.
-This is for you.

553
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,227
-Take this too.
-Mr. Choi.

554
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,937
-Here, take this.
-Thanks.

555
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,856
-Thanks.
-Mr. Choi!

556
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,650
Mr. Choi, I made these cookies. Please…

557
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,362
-He's so good-looking.
-What?

558
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,949
He closed the doors after seeing me.

559
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:51,200
Isn't he so cool?

560
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,244
How cute, Chi-yeol.

561
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,414
Do you think
that'll make me give up on you?

562
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,832
No way.

563
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,339
Good work. Wait, Mr. Choi.

564
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,841
Yes?

565
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,969
Ms. Cho.

566
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,055
It's Jung.

567
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,684
I think Cho suits you better.

568
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:19,604
Anyway, what is it?

569
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:22,106
Well…

570
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:26,611
A friend of mine is a big fan of yours.

571
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,946
She's a pianist.

572
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:30,531
-Would you like me to set you up with her?
-No, thanks.

573
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:31,991
I prefer a natural approach.

574
00:32:32,075 --> 00:32:34,494
So you want to meet people
in a more natural setting.

575
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,580
But she's gorgeous.
She comes from a good family too.

576
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,665
I'm good.

577
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:41,542
Bye.

578
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:44,504
Ms. Cho.

579
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,799
I'm sorry.

580
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,807
Just because you're a star
doesn't mean you can change my name.

581
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,186
He's so full of himself.

582
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,863
Man, I'm tired.

583
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:17,328
Keep them in a safe place.
Don't lose them.

584
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:21,165
If you throw them away,
I'll be bashed online again.

585
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:24,752
I know.

586
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:37,890
You should give it a try.

587
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,018
What do you mean?

588
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:41,978
The blind date.

589
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,647
You never meet new people.

590
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,861
What I meant by a natural approach is

591
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,406
that I'd rather not meet anyone.

592
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,827
Do you know what's
the most pointless human activity of all?

593
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:00,329
Relationships.

594
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:03,541
You get to know each other,
rely on each other,

595
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,626
then you fight,

596
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,920
and try to make up.

597
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,590
What a waste of energy.

598
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:15,595
I spend 99 percent of my energy on work
and the rest on surviving.

599
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:18,181
-I find relationships--
-Detestable?

600
00:34:19,974 --> 00:34:22,935
I get it, so just eat this.

601
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,772
You haven't eaten anything today
except eight cups of coffee.

602
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,026
Goodness.

603
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,488
I don't think I can eat.

604
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:36,741
Why is the human body so inefficient?

605
00:34:36,824 --> 00:34:39,577
You have to eat, sleep, and excrete.

606
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,662
There must be a more efficient way.

607
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,165
Why are there still no pills
that can keep us alive?

608
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,584
Maybe no one wants them.

609
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,044
I'd buy them all.

610
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:50,379
Maybe I should invest.

611
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:59,180
What the hell?
The texture of the sandwich is like paper…

612
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:04,352
Mr. Ji.

613
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,315
Are you okay, sir?

614
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,569
People would think
you have morning sickness.

615
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,739
You're unable to eat
whenever you feel tired.

616
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,658
It wasn't this bad three years ago.

617
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,870
What's the point of being
the Trillion Won Man if you never spend?

618
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,460
My mouth tastes like garbage.

619
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:31,462
It's your stomach acid.

620
00:35:34,757 --> 00:35:36,968
Are you still seeing a doctor?
What did they say?

621
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,387
Well…

622
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,347
An eating disorder caused by stress,

623
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,307
emotional deprivation,
feelings of emptiness…

624
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,308
What else was there?

625
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,729
Do you keep seeing that student?

626
00:35:51,065 --> 00:35:51,899
Sometimes.

627
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,780
So what can you do to get better?

628
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,449
I need to rest and avoid stress…

629
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:07,456
Stop talking to me.

630
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,131
What do you want me to do?

631
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,133
What on earth am I supposed to do?

632
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,803
Answer me.

633
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:22,889
Where do you think you're going?

634
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:25,933
-You're out of your mind!
-Yes, I am!

635
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,685
If you're so smart, tell me.

636
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:28,853
Go ahead, tell me.

637
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:32,982
You're home.

638
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,734
I…

639
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,738
Hey.

640
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,118
Bring me your exam papers.

641
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,089
Why did you get this one wrong?

642
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,217
It's a basic question.

643
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,761
It was a mistake. I mixed up the vocab.

644
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,264
You didn't study hard enough.

645
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,808
You can't make a mistake
when diagnosing a patient.

646
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,733
That's why I don't want to be a doctor.

647
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:17,735
Then what?

648
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,487
What do you want to be?

649
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,155
What?

650
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:22,990
You didn't want to study law either.

651
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,076
Then what do you want to become?

652
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:26,661
Tell me.

653
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:41,884
Go to your room.

654
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:43,427
Okay.

655
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,815
I'm done cleaning up.

656
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:42,486
Nam Haeng-seon, the genius center back.

657
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:43,988
You haven't lost your touch.

658
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:45,740
Let's wrap up and get chicken and beer.

659
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:47,283
Hae-e took her mock exam today.

660
00:38:47,908 --> 00:38:50,328
We're partying because Hae-e took an exam?

661
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,287
Of course, we are.

662
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,457
Exactly.

663
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,916
I have no objection.

664
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,504
By the way, Jae-woo,
why is your face so red?

665
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,340
Are you already drunk?

666
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,301
Isn't it because he's been hunching
over his phone all day?

667
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:07,053
He's hooked on predators these days.

668
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,681
Jae-woo.

669
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:16,270
Your uncle has a fever.

670
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,363
It's 39.5 degrees.

671
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,074
Hey, isn't that dangerously high?

672
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:30,826
Why didn't you say
you were running a fever?

673
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,286
It's 39.8 now. Oh, no.

674
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,297
We have an emergency.

675
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,091
The address is…

676
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,268
Good work today.

677
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,396
-Did you call a cab?
-Yes.

678
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,272
Why won't you let me buy you a car?

679
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:03,401
I prefer taking cabs.
I get reimbursed anyway.

680
00:40:03,484 --> 00:40:06,028
-Get some rest, sir.
-I sure would like to.

681
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:43,441
-Who are you?
-Wow, your place looks amazing!

682
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,901
-It's so spacious! Incredible!
-Hey!

683
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,696
Hey, what do you think you're doing?

684
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:51,740
Mr. Choi, none of the kids
have been here before, right?

685
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:52,950
I'm the first, aren't I?

686
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,078
Get out right now.
Do you know what time it is?

687
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:58,289
Hey!

688
00:40:58,372 --> 00:41:00,791
I'm just here to give you this.

689
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,335
I baked these cookies for you.

690
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,796
You're breaking and entering.
It's a serious crime.

691
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,089
-Get out.
-I just--

692
00:41:07,173 --> 00:41:08,632
-You have some nerve.
-Take this.

693
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,885
-Come here.
-That hurts!

694
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:12,052
I'm at the garage.

695
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,013
Yes. I see you.

696
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,475
You should've taken it earlier.
You closed the doors on purpose!

697
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,393
Don't leave until she enters her house.

698
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:21,812
Wait--

699
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:23,772
-I--
-Get in.

700
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,940
Mr. Choi.

701
00:41:25,024 --> 00:41:26,150
-Can I get a hug?
-What?

702
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,068
-I'll leave after a hug.
-Are you joking?

703
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,403
-Get in!
-Mr. Choi!

704
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,863
Hey, what are you doing?

705
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,907
-Mr. Choi!
-Why are you doing this?

706
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,658
-Get off me.
-You smell so nice.

707
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:35,993
-Take me home.
-Stop it!

708
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,786
How are you so strong?

709
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,538
Get off me. Now!

710
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:41,707
-Hey!
-Please take me home.

711
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,917
-Please?
-Get off me!

712
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,752
Get off me while I'm being nice.

713
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,091
It's down to 37.5 degrees.

714
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,760
His fever is breaking.

715
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:57,765
Fever can lead to infective endocarditis
due to his congenital heart disease.

716
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,185
He'll stay overnight
and we'll run another test tomorrow.

717
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,479
If everything looks good, he can leave.

718
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,272
Okay. Thank you, sir.

719
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:18,536
I'm here to pay
for an emergency room visit.

720
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:20,120
The name is Nam Jae-woo.

721
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:21,997
Mr. Nam Jae-woo, correct?

722
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,003
The tests and the fever treatment today
will be 380,000 won.

723
00:42:31,757 --> 00:42:35,761
Could you split the payment
among these four cards?

724
00:42:37,513 --> 00:42:39,223
Sure, I'll do that.

725
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,060
I run a shop.

726
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:45,479
That's why I have so many cards
for my purchases.

727
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:47,064
Right.

728
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,445
Hey.

729
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,989
Uncle was moved to another room.

730
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:58,075
Go home. You have to go
to the market in the morning.

731
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,743
I asked Yeong-ju to do it.

732
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:01,495
Go home. You have school tomorrow.

733
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,039
-Will you be okay?
-Of course.

734
00:43:04,123 --> 00:43:05,541
You know I'm made of steel.

735
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:08,502
I was the toughest one
back in my handball days.

736
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,464
Go home.

737
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,550
See you tomorrow.

738
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:17,863
CHOI CHI-YEOL IS ALL YOU NEED

739
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,635
Is our sewing assignment due tomorrow?

740
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,013
Correct. My mom asked the dry cleaner.

741
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,390
Same here.

742
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,292
I forgot to buy water.

743
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:10,929
Mr. Choi!

744
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,307
Mr. Choi!

745
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,645
Why do you always look so perfect?

746
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,189
Unbelievable.
You get more handsome by the day.

747
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,822
Can you help me with this one?
I can't seem to solve it.

748
00:49:10,906 --> 00:49:12,532
Hello, Mr. Ji. What's up?

749
00:49:13,116 --> 00:49:14,618
I'm sorry to wake you up.

750
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,745
But you need to see Studyhard.com.

751
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,038
STUDYHARD.COM:
ONLINE STUDENT COMMUNITY

752
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,247
Why?

753
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:29,966
TRENDING SEARCHES:
1. EXPLAIN, CHI-YEOL

754
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,678
2. WE BELIEVE YOU, CHI-YEOL
3. STAR TEACHER

755
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,436
IS STAR TEACHER CHOI CHI-YEOL
DATING HIS STUDENT?

756
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:45,190
It's not true.

757
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:47,859
Hello, sir.
What should we do about his social media?

758
00:49:47,943 --> 00:49:50,362
You need to take it down.
This is defamation.

759
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:52,531
-Understood, thank you.
-It's not true.

760
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:54,116
-Okay.
-Hello?

761
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,956
There are articles
mentioning your initials.

762
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,625
Your name is in the trending searches
on Studyhard.com.

763
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,502
"One. Explain, Chi-yeol."

764
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,045
"Two. We believe you, Chi-yeol."

765
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:08,130
"Three. Star teacher."

766
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,339
"Four. Pedophil--"

767
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:11,925
Should I read the comments?

768
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:16,972
"I'm so disappointed."

769
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,765
"Why would you date her, not me?"

770
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,601
"I thought he was crazy about math,
but he was plain crazy."

771
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,186
"I believe you, Mr. Choi."

772
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,938
"Promise you'll stay strong."

773
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,107
Gosh, I should've kicked her out
right away.

774
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,860
You always say that,
yet you call cabs for them.

775
00:50:29,943 --> 00:50:33,405
-You say one thing and do another.
-I can't kick out a teenage girl at night…

776
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,826
If something bad happens,
I'd lose all my students.

777
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:39,536
Who posted that anyway?

778
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:42,330
Is it Chiyeolsucks again?
The one always bad-mouthing me.

779
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:44,332
I don't think it's them.

780
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:47,043
But they are leaving
a ton of hateful comments.

781
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,385
The original post has been taken down.

782
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:58,472
And all the Skymom.net posts
have been declared defamatory and deleted.

783
00:50:59,139 --> 00:51:01,641
The matter will blow over in a few days,
so don't worry.

784
00:51:02,184 --> 00:51:03,018
Right?

785
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:06,688
People lost interest in
those rumors of us dating after two days.

786
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,524
It's not like this can harm my reputation.

787
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:11,443
That's never going to happen.

788
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:14,863
Will you say that three more times?

789
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:18,033
That's never going to happen.

790
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,952
I'll stop stressing over it.
I'm done with this!

791
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,288
-Mr. Choi!
-What's the matter?

792
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:25,999
You need to see this.
That girl posted something.

793
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,669
Mr. Choi and I really are together.

794
00:51:29,753 --> 00:51:31,838
Please just let us love each other.

795
00:51:32,339 --> 00:51:35,008
No matter what you think,
this is true love.

796
00:51:35,091 --> 00:51:36,802
That crazy little…

797
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:37,969
Mr. Choi!

798
00:51:47,646 --> 00:51:53,902
NOTICE FROM THE PRIDE ACADEMY:
CHOI CHI-YEOL'S CLASS IS CANCELED TODAY

799
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:03,912
DID HE REALLY CANCEL HIS CLASS?

800
00:52:03,995 --> 00:52:05,205
THE RUMOR MUST BE TRUE

801
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,832
WE WILL WAIT FOR YOU, CHI-YEOL

802
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,749
THIS IS A FIRST

803
00:52:07,833 --> 00:52:09,292
DID HE REALLY CANCEL HIS CLASS?

804
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,961
LEAVE A COURSE REVIEW

805
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:15,298
I BELIEVE YOU, CHI-YEOL!

806
00:52:16,132 --> 00:52:17,717
Why did he suddenly cancel?

807
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,302
Beats me. It's so strange.

808
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,013
He should know how much
one canceled class costs.

809
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:24,224
He's hiding.

810
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,392
Why?

811
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:27,352
He was caught on camera with his student.

812
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,563
The rumor isn't totally groundless.

813
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,774
He's the type of guy
that would date his student.

814
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:34,693
Jeez.

815
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:39,447
What?

816
00:52:40,156 --> 00:52:41,783
Choi Chi-yeol canceled class today.

817
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:43,326
-Oh, no.
-What happened?

818
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:45,745
He's never done this before.

819
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,916
-Could it be true?
-What?

820
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,086
There was this post on Skymom.net
that got deleted right away today.

821
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,087
-I saw it.
-Right?

822
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,506
-He has this thing with a teenage girl…
-Exactly.

823
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,174
-Right?
-Don't be ridiculous.

824
00:52:58,758 --> 00:53:00,927
Why would he do that? It can't be true.

825
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,680
Hold on. Let me try calling the director.

826
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,684
Hello, Director.

827
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,562
Okay, got it.

828
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:12,689
Bye.

829
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,608
What did he say?

830
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:18,945
A canceled class is no big deal,

831
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:21,281
but no one can know you're sick.

832
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:23,366
It can be seen
as related to today's incident

833
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,868
or used against you.

834
00:53:28,163 --> 00:53:29,581
You know what the doctor said?

835
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:30,957
No, I don't.

836
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,667
He said whatever it is
you do for a living,

837
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,127
you need to stop right now.

838
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:35,587
Sleep-deprived, malnourished--

839
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:40,383
Your body is out of whack.

840
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,303
The Trillion Won Man is malnourished?
That's embarrassing.

841
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,680
It's not that I don't want to eat.
I just can't.

842
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,686
We need to find a way to help you eat.

843
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,066
Stop obsessing over work
and take better care of yourself.

844
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,234
-It's part of being professional.
-I get it!

845
00:53:58,318 --> 00:53:59,903
You're turning into such a nag.

846
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,655
I liked you because you were quiet.

847
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:08,453
-You--
-I said I get it.

848
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:16,628
If you are using the parking lot,

849
00:54:16,711 --> 00:54:19,714
please pay a parking fee
at the information desk…

850
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,133
Sir, wait here.
I have to go pay for parking.

851
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:24,552
-Make it as quick as you can.
-Got it.

852
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:48,743
Gosh, seriously. Hey.

853
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:50,870
Hand over your phone.

854
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,915
This kind of rude behavior
really needs to stop!

855
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:56,292
-Sorry?
-What did you just take a picture of?

856
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,794
Trying to start another rumor?

857
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:02,382
Delete the photos and I'll let it slide.
Hand me your phone.

858
00:55:04,342 --> 00:55:05,677
Where are you going?

859
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,763
What's the deal with you?
This is unacceptable!

860
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:11,641
Hand me your phone.
Are you a professional photographer?

861
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,018
-Were you hired?
-The tiger.

862
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,436
Did you take those photos last night?

863
00:55:14,519 --> 00:55:15,812
-Give me the phone.
-Jae-woo!

864
00:55:15,895 --> 00:55:17,981
-Just give me your phone!
-Jae-woo!

865
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:20,108
What's going on here?

866
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:21,609
Who are you?

867
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,112
Are you two a team?

868
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:27,032
Kind of. Anyway, let him go first.

869
00:55:27,115 --> 00:55:29,909
Before that,
I'm a little low on energy today.

870
00:55:29,993 --> 00:55:32,078
Just delete the photos,
and I'll let it slide.

871
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:33,413
-Give me the phone.
-Photos?

872
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,999
Let him go first. You're scaring him!

873
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:40,754
He fell.

874
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,217
He's so flimsy.

875
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:48,595
Damn it.

876
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,140
What the hell?

877
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:54,309
-Hey!
-He took my phone!

878
00:55:59,814 --> 00:56:01,816
-Hey, stop right there!
-Jeez.

879
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:25,048
She's fast.

880
00:56:25,715 --> 00:56:26,883
Freakishly fast.

881
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,887
I can run 100m in 16 seconds.

882
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,597
That's 22.5km per hour.

883
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:36,184
But considering my age and poor health,
I can't run as fast.

884
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:40,522
That woman seems to be running
at a speed of at least 25km per hour.

885
00:56:41,314 --> 00:56:42,565
I stand no chance.

886
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:44,317
Only one thing can save me.

887
00:56:44,818 --> 00:56:45,860
Inertia.

888
00:57:04,212 --> 00:57:08,341
RESTROOM

889
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,186
Where did that jerk go?

890
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:22,647
Jeez.

891
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,150
I think he's in here.

892
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,613
Sir? Come out while I'm being nice.

893
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:33,825
If you come out now,
I'll take the phone and leave.

894
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:34,742
Got it?

895
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,291
You're creating bad karma here.

896
00:57:41,374 --> 00:57:42,792
What goes around comes around.

897
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,879
The world is surprisingly fair.

898
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,888
Are you in there?

899
00:57:59,767 --> 00:58:00,935
Are you?

900
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:03,480
Gosh.

901
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:06,232
Excuse me.

902
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:08,401
What are you doing in here?

903
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,778
This is the men's room. Come out.

904
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,616
There might be
a phone thief hiding in here.

905
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:15,617
That's nonsense.

906
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:17,285
-Leave or I'll call the cops.
-I'm serious.

907
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,411
-Get out.
-I mean--

908
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,830
-Get out right now!
-Believe me, sir.

909
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,345
Let's see.

910
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:37,931
NAM JAE-WOO

911
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,225
Nam Jae-woo? Let's see here.

912
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,020
What is this?

913
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:45,688
The tiger?

914
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,610
I mean…

915
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,740
What the…

916
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,132
NAM HAENG-SEON

917
00:59:13,841 --> 00:59:15,260
There you are.

918
00:59:17,554 --> 00:59:19,597
Give me my brother's phone, you thief.

919
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,234
Oh, no.

920
00:59:35,738 --> 00:59:36,864
It's cracked.

921
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:39,867
Damn it.

922
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:44,956
I'm here.

923
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,667
-Don't come. I'll come to you.
-Where were you?

924
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:49,711
We have to go.

925
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:58,344
-Let's go.
-Okay.

926
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,768
Let's get going.

927
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:13,234
What is this, the DMZ?

928
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:15,111
This neighborhood is a damn minefield.

929
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,905
A crazy stalker, a weird lady…

930
01:00:20,366 --> 01:00:21,659
Maybe I should move.

931
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,622
Are you going home?

932
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:26,873
No, to the academy.

933
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:30,043
I want to finish up the pop quiz
to make up for the canceled class.

934
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,347
DAEHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

935
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:44,682
It's quite expensive to fix this.

936
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,185
That damn tiger guy.

937
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:49,437
I should've captured him alive there.

938
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,606
Jeez.

939
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:55,026
Haeng-seon, where's my phone?

940
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,134
Jang Dan-ji.

941
01:01:25,848 --> 01:01:27,308
-Bang Su-a.
-Yes.

942
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:34,649
It's not official yet,

943
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,235
but Su-a seems to have come out on top.

944
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:46,035
MATH
SCORE: 83, LEVEL: 2

945
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,537
-Kim Hui-won.
-Yes.

946
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:52,667
Your mom did an amazing job.

947
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:57,088
Which seamstress's work is this?

948
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:05,722
This looks professional.

949
01:02:06,681 --> 01:02:07,807
Which dry cleaner?

950
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,520
Meanwhile, someone obviously
did her assignment herself.

951
01:02:12,603 --> 01:02:13,604
Hae-e.

952
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,568
NAM HAE-E

953
01:02:39,380 --> 01:02:42,008
Get in, Hae-e. I'll give you a lift home.

954
01:02:42,091 --> 01:02:44,635
It's okay.
I'll pick up an umbrella at the store.

955
01:02:44,719 --> 01:02:46,929
-All right.
-Thanks anyway.

956
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:06,949
Jae-woo, just eat a little.

957
01:03:07,033 --> 01:03:08,701
You need to take your medicine.

958
01:03:11,329 --> 01:03:13,122
Do you want to run a fever again?

959
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,169
I'll have your phone fixed.

960
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,378
So just eat a bit.

961
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:20,963
Okay?

962
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:27,804
I'm home.

963
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:30,973
Are you okay, Uncle Jae-woo?

964
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,600
Gosh, you stubborn goat.

965
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:36,687
You're soaking wet.

966
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,232
It's raining.

967
01:03:41,651 --> 01:03:46,113
Why didn't you share an umbrella
with a friend or buy one?

968
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,741
Talk about being book-smart.

969
01:03:55,206 --> 01:03:57,500
Jae-woo,
I promise I'll have your phone fixed!

970
01:03:57,583 --> 01:03:59,043
You don't believe me?

971
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:03,548
Eat, or I'll beat you up.
Eat, or I'll kill you!

972
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:05,383
Here. Just one spoonful.

973
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:19,146
Hae-e, come out and make some hotteok.

974
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,523
Your uncle loves it.

975
01:04:21,774 --> 01:04:23,651
I'm going to sleep. I'm tired.

976
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:26,946
Come on. Grill a few for your uncle.

977
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:28,865
He needs to take his medicine.

978
01:04:29,574 --> 01:04:30,575
Please?

979
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,744
Have porridge after you make hotteok.

980
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,289
Your uncle didn't even touch it.
You love porridge.

981
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:39,792
No, I hate it.

982
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,837
I just had no choice but to eat it
whenever he got sick.

983
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:45,631
Why are you so upset?

984
01:04:49,176 --> 01:04:50,720
Did something happen at school?

985
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:56,225
Is this about the mock exam?
Because you didn't get 100 percent?

986
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,813
You don't get 100 percent on a mock exam.

987
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:02,565
The CSAT has a level system!

988
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:06,569
Other moms give their kids rides
and know all the news about education.

989
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:09,155
They even do their kids' assignments
so they can study!

990
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,242
I'm not even asking you to do that.

991
01:05:15,286 --> 01:05:17,622
But at least ask me
if I'm coming down with a cold.

992
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,206
Is it because you're my stepmom?

993
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:26,756
Hey.

994
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,050
Hey!

995
01:05:30,176 --> 01:05:31,886
Why would you be so mean?

996
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:33,763
I'm not your stepmom!

997
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:37,016
Then why did you take in
a mean kid like me, Auntie?

998
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:39,977
You should've sent me away
when my mom abandoned me.

999
01:05:49,403 --> 01:05:51,781
I should eat some porridge
before I take my medicine.

1000
01:05:51,864 --> 01:05:52,823
Where's the porridge?

1001
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:09,256
GOOD RESTAURANTS IN NOKEUN-RO

1002
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,633
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

1003
01:06:10,716 --> 01:06:11,550
HIGHLY ADDICTIVE

1004
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,730
So what's your sister doing now?

1005
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,400
Did she try calling Hae-e? Not picking up?

1006
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:29,944
Please stop talking about phones.

1007
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,362
Right.

1008
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,948
It's an eventful day for your family.

1009
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,616
What a bad day.

1010
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,496
-Hello.
-Welcome.

1011
01:06:40,579 --> 01:06:41,747
I can get takeout, right?

1012
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,040
That's right.

1013
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:45,835
Goodness, he's totally my type.
Fragile and pale.

1014
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,382
-Do I just fill the tray myself?
-You betcha.

1015
01:06:53,592 --> 01:06:55,469
How can a man be so fair-skinned?

1016
01:07:00,933 --> 01:07:03,227
He has asparagus fingers.
So long and slim.

1017
01:07:08,149 --> 01:07:10,401
The braised tofu turned out amazing today.

1018
01:07:20,911 --> 01:07:22,288
-Do I use…
-Exactly.

1019
01:07:23,289 --> 01:07:24,915
The gungjung tteokbokki is nuts.

1020
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:26,333
I see.

1021
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,384
Mr. Choi, I brought you food.

1022
01:07:36,093 --> 01:07:38,721
This side dish shop
is all the rage among bloggers.

1023
01:07:38,804 --> 01:07:40,306
No artificial ingredients.

1024
01:07:41,307 --> 01:07:43,309
You're so kind but gullible.

1025
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:45,603
Bloggers get paid to advertise the store.

1026
01:07:46,187 --> 01:07:47,646
So you're not going to eat it?

1027
01:07:50,941 --> 01:07:52,318
Suit yourself.

1028
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:55,905
Collapse, get taken to the hospital,
cancel your class,

1029
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:59,033
and take over Studyhard.com again.

1030
01:07:59,116 --> 01:08:01,827
-Maybe it'll be your routine soon.
-All right, I get it!

1031
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:04,330
I'll eat it at home. Stop nagging.

1032
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:09,835
Eat it now.

1033
01:08:17,134 --> 01:08:18,469
He's definitely not kind.

1034
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:55,589
SEON'S CAFETERIA

1035
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:53,939
Hey.

1036
01:09:56,817 --> 01:09:58,485
I'm not your stepmom. I'm your aunt.

1037
01:09:58,986 --> 01:10:00,279
I know.

1038
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:02,740
I was just saying.

1039
01:10:04,241 --> 01:10:06,660
Why do you act out like this
once in a while?

1040
01:10:07,494 --> 01:10:09,705
You know these events traumatize me.

1041
01:10:09,788 --> 01:10:12,208
My heart drops a beat
every time you do that.

1042
01:10:14,835 --> 01:10:17,504
Your heart doesn't "drop" a beat.
It "skips" a beat.

1043
01:10:17,588 --> 01:10:19,173
Same difference.

1044
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:28,724
I'm sorry.

1045
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:31,936
It was mean of me.

1046
01:10:32,436 --> 01:10:35,105
Yes, it was.

1047
01:10:36,023 --> 01:10:37,566
I accept your apology.

1048
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:42,071
But why did you do that?
Be straight with me so I can understand.

1049
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:46,825
I'll never know unless you tell me.

1050
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,411
What is it?

1051
01:10:59,672 --> 01:11:01,090
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

1052
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:11,267
What if I throw up after eating again?

1053
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,731
But I still need to eat.

1054
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:23,237
To survive.

1055
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:46,695
Tell me, Hae-e.

1056
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:50,783
Nam Hae-e.

1057
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:56,872
Well…

1058
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,085
Enroll me in the star teacher
Choi Chi-yeol's math course.

1059
01:13:03,337 --> 01:13:04,797
The star teacher Choi Chi-yeol?

1060
01:13:17,518 --> 01:13:18,727
"Nation's Best"?

1061
01:13:45,504 --> 01:13:49,049
The repair will cost 287,000 won.

1062
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,300
Is that okay?

1063
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:53,178
Well, let me think about it first.

1064
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,930
Perhaps I'll get a new one instead.

1065
01:13:55,013 --> 01:13:57,891
What do I do?
Money keeps slipping through my fingers.

1066
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,978
If I find him, I'll beat him to a pulp.

1067
01:14:02,312 --> 01:14:05,274
He looked somewhat familiar.
He must live around here.

1068
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:07,025
Where can I find him?

1069
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:12,197
EPILOGUE

1070
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,576
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

1071
01:14:16,577 --> 01:14:18,579
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1072
01:14:18,662 --> 01:14:22,249
Whether Hae-e can enroll
in that star teacher's course or not

1073
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:24,251
depends on your cooperation, my effort,

1074
01:14:24,334 --> 01:14:26,003
and one percent luck.

1075
01:14:26,086 --> 01:14:28,338
Enrollment for his next course
starts tomorrow.

1076
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:30,090
But it won't be easy to sign up.

1077
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:34,470
I am going to enroll Hae-e
in that star teacher's course.

1078
01:14:35,471 --> 01:14:36,430
Where's your head at?

1079
01:14:36,513 --> 01:14:38,682
The course starts today.
What are you going to do?

1080
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,477
"Real math from a star teacher.
For math, Choi Chi-yeol."

1081
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:43,103
I've seen him somewhere.

1082
01:14:43,187 --> 01:14:44,104
What's she doing there?

1083
01:14:44,688 --> 01:14:45,522
Let's go.

1084
01:14:45,606 --> 01:14:47,024
Who are those guys?

1085
01:14:49,026 --> 01:14:54,031
