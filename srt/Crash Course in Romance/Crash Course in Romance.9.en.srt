CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,105
Mr. Choi, one more thing.

3
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:05,231
Mr. Choi.

4
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,234
Then what about today?

5
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,490
Did you really come here because of Hae-e?

6
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:17,160
Is that the only reason why you're here?

7
00:01:19,704 --> 00:01:20,830
Or…

8
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,626
Or is it because…

9
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:42,977
Hello, Mr. Choi.

10
00:01:43,728 --> 00:01:45,647
I'm the mother of Bang Su-a
from the All Care Program.

11
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:46,773
On Skymom.net…

12
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,441
Oh, my!

13
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,734
What the heck?

14
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,780
-Hold on a second.
-This is bad.

15
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,866
Do you think they know about everything?

16
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,159
But how?

17
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,371
I've been keeping my mouth shut.
Yeong-ju is the only person I told.

18
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:03,206
You're hurting me.

19
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,375
Sorry, I didn't realize.

20
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:07,585
What do we do, Mr. Choi?

21
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,134
You stay here, Ms. Nam.

22
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:15,718
I'll sort it out.

23
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,429
What exactly is your plan? Mr. Choi!

24
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,306
Mr. Choi!

25
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,976
-What's wrong, Mom?
-Gosh.

26
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:23,935
What happened?

27
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:25,478
Well…

28
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,981
It's nothing. Go back inside, Hae-e.

29
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,983
It's okay. Go inside.

30
00:02:35,697 --> 00:02:37,115
You're back.

31
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:40,076
I thought we'd have to wait here
all night long.

32
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:43,079
Come on. It hasn't even been a minute.

33
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,917
Don't you think you're being
a little impatient, Su-a's mother?

34
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,295
Maybe, but for good reason.

35
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,298
You were here to tutor Hae-e, right?

36
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,135
We already know everything,
so don't try to weasel out of this.

37
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,472
That's right.

38
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:03,516
-Oh, my.
-But is that a problem?

39
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,020
I mean…

40
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,522
Yes, it is.

41
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,984
It is, of course, a very serious problem.

42
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,736
This is wrong on so many levels.

43
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,821
Okay, follow me.

44
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,448
Hold on. Where are we going?

45
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:19,741
We'll talk in my office.

46
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,868
You all seem to have a lot to say to me.

47
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,454
It's cold. We might catch a cold.

48
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:26,247
-No, we're fine.
-I'm not.

49
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,124
I can't afford to lose my voice.

50
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:30,710
Will you take responsibility
if I catch a cold?

51
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:32,045
Let's go.

52
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,340
Goodness.

53
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:37,050
He sure takes good care of himself.

54
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:39,510
-Let's go. Let's follow him.
-Jeez.

55
00:03:58,363 --> 00:03:59,239
Hold on.

56
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:02,951
Where are they going?

57
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,002
Why isn't he answering?

58
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,048
I mean…

59
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,342
What is going on here?

60
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:26,140
That's right.

61
00:04:26,641 --> 00:04:28,434
I'm tutoring her.

62
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:30,353
I'm teaching Hae-e privately.

63
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,397
How are you so brazen?

64
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:35,483
You have an exclusive contract
with The Pride.

65
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:37,402
Plus, is this even legal?

66
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:41,447
-Did you notify the Office of Education?
-No, there's no reason to.

67
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,242
I'm tutoring her free of charge.

68
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,954
"Free of charge"? Why?

69
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:50,415
Ladies.

70
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,876
I think you've stepped over the line.

71
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,213
Will you arrest me?

72
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:02,010
I felt bad when a student
got kicked out unfairly,

73
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:04,304
so I offered to tutor her.

74
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,140
You know I've been holding
college admissions talk shows.

75
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,183
I try my best to contribute to society.

76
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:12,895
In addition, I teach her after work
in my free time.

77
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:15,523
So why should I be ashamed?

78
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,358
What about the class materials?

79
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,986
Do you know how much we pay
for the All Care Program?

80
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,780
All the materials belong to me,
not the program.

81
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,532
I own all copyrights.

82
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,203
Fine then.

83
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:34,042
But do you offer private tutoring
every time you see a mistreated student?

84
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,544
You said you offered to tutor her.

85
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:37,837
About that--

86
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,422
Wait!

87
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:40,757
I asked him to do it.

88
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,760
I begged him to tutor Hae-e.

89
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:46,095
I even made a huge scene.

90
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,305
-Excuse me.
-Ladies,

91
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:50,016
I understand why you're upset,
but direct your anger at me.

92
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,185
I'm the one who dragged him into this.

93
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,270
After Hae-e got kicked out,

94
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:56,481
-I completely lost it and--
-Hold on a second.

95
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,649
-We need to talk.
-I--

96
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:00,526
-What did she say?
-Goodness.

97
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,820
-What did she just say?
-Hold on.

98
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,572
-What was that?
-Good grief.

99
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,951
-Mr. Choi, wait--
-Mr. Ji.

100
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,912
Send them all away. We're done here.

101
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,663
Wait! We're not done yet.

102
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:13,581
We…

103
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,625
What are you doing, Mr. Choi?

104
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:18,127
-This is the men's room.
-No, not here.

105
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,630
Wait.

106
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,634
I mean, why are you here?

107
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,011
I told you to stay put.
I was going to sort it out.

108
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:29,764
How could I stay put
knowing you'd be in trouble?

109
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,058
So you're here to rescue me?

110
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:34,268
Did you think I'd let them
walk all over me?

111
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,731
Why would you lie to them
and sacrifice yourself?

112
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,108
I can take care of this.

113
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,568
Still…

114
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:45,655
You have a tendency
to try to fix everything.

115
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:47,281
Get rid of that.

116
00:06:47,365 --> 00:06:50,118
It's taking a toll on not only you
but those around you.

117
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,619
Why would you say that?

118
00:06:52,411 --> 00:06:54,872
You got in trouble because of me,
so I just--

119
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,999
And I'm in bigger trouble now!

120
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,503
Look what you've done. What is this?

121
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,838
This looks totally weird.

122
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,174
I mean,

123
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,426
you're the one who made it look weird.

124
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,305
Some teamwork we have.

125
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:14,559
Anyway, let's sneak out
before they find us.

126
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,186
How? They won't let this slide.

127
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:20,148
-I don't know. I'm thinking.
-What's with the tone?

128
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:24,527
It's because I always played offense.
Defense isn't my forte.

129
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,405
Team play.

130
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,115
Don't you know that?

131
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,784
I bet you used to get a lot of red cards.

132
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:32,869
I'm sure of it.

133
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:35,371
-Let's go.
-What does that…

134
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,460
How did he know?

135
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,462
So annoying.

136
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:58,769
THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT OF OUR RELATIONSHIP

137
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,229
EPISODE 9

138
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,440
I can't believe
how brazen Choi Chi-yeol is.

139
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:05,109
How could he accuse us
of making a fuss over nothing?

140
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,570
We didn't see this coming, did we?

141
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,779
Su-hui!

142
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,407
There you are! Hey.

143
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,034
I mean…

144
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,039
What the hell is going on?

145
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,418
Choi Chi-yeol is tutoring Hae-e?

146
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,253
Who told you?

147
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,965
Well, I had texted Ha-jeong's mom
to ask something…

148
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,843
That's not important. So what did you do?

149
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,888
Did you have it out with him?

150
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:35,306
What will he do?

151
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,307
Is he going to quit?

152
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,850
No.

153
00:08:39,018 --> 00:08:40,394
But you see,

154
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,979
after hearing what he said,

155
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,440
I'm starting to have second thoughts.

156
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,985
So what if he doesn't think
it's a problem?

157
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:50,238
We do think it's a problem.

158
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,491
-Give me a second.
-What?

159
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,909
I'll talk to the director.

160
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:56,452
-Hey.
-I'll be right back.

161
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,829
-What?
-Hey, wait.

162
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,377
She's completely flipped her lid.

163
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,589
I have a bad feeling about this.

164
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:10,925
Where's Ms. Jang?

165
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:14,512
We could really use her smarts right now.

166
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:40,705
IMPERIAL APARTMENTS

167
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,002
Lee Hui-jae.

168
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,628
Where on earth have you been?

169
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,172
Hui-jae.

170
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,342
Hui-jae.

171
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:56,178
Open the door.

172
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:57,722
Hui-jae!

173
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,838
Timing is everything
in a situation like this.

174
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,010
I should've shut them up
and smoothed things over right there.

175
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:41,140
How did the moms find out anyway?

176
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,605
Jin I-sang.

177
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:06,457
CHOI CHI-YEOL THE ASSHOLE

178
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,376
CHOI CHI-YEOL THE ASSHOLE

179
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:15,257
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

180
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,554
Mr. Ji, try calling Jin I-sang.
He's ignoring my calls.

181
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:22,139
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

182
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,392
-Mr. Choi--
-If he picks up, let me talk to him.

183
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:28,104
What I'm trying to say is,
the director is here.

184
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,651
Hey, stop worrying.

185
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,861
Mr. Choi said it wasn't a problem.

186
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,197
Still,

187
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,324
I doubt those women will let it go.

188
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,785
You don't know that yet.

189
00:11:43,911 --> 00:11:46,664
And it's not like either of you
did anything wrong.

190
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,291
All he did was tutor a student privately.

191
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,752
What are you so afraid of?

192
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:55,798
It's not like you forged money
or smuggled anything.

193
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:58,926
Hae-e is the only one
who's been tutored by him.

194
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:01,512
That's what those moms can't stand.

195
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,558
Why would they make
such a fuss about nothing?

196
00:12:07,101 --> 00:12:09,687
Then again, back when I worked
at a swimming pool,

197
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,231
the students would make a huge fuss

198
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:16,694
if the swim instructor gave anyone
even the slightest bit more attention.

199
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,988
I guess they are more sensitive

200
00:12:19,697 --> 00:12:21,282
since this is about their kids.

201
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,702
And it's the star teacher, Choi Chi-yeol.

202
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:30,207
I've made up my mind.

203
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,751
The tutoring should be put on hold.

204
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,049
Let me cut to the chase.

205
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,593
Quit tutoring her.

206
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,970
Like I already said,

207
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:46,557
I'm tutoring her free of charge,
so there's no legal issue here.

208
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:49,226
This isn't about legal issues.

209
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:53,439
Why would you teach a student privately?
It doesn't make any sense.

210
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,234
I was absolutely baffled
after getting that call last night.

211
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:02,364
Quit tutoring her right away,
or the All Care moms will boycott you.

212
00:13:04,074 --> 00:13:05,451
Boycott me?

213
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,619
It's a threat.

214
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,996
They want their kids
to receive your full attention

215
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:11,665
and be the only ones
benefiting from those materials.

216
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:14,793
Man, I can't believe those ladies.

217
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:17,713
They want a say in
not only who gets to join the program,

218
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,132
but also in how the teacher
spends his private time?

219
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:22,718
What is the real reason they're upset?

220
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:26,388
Is it because I'm tutoring a student who
unfairly got kicked out of the program?

221
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,725
Or is it because she got first place
in the September mock?

222
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:31,936
What? She got first place?

223
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,604
They can boycott me all they want.

224
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,775
-Switch me out of the program.
-Hold on. Don't be so--

225
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,568
It's their wish, so I have no choice.

226
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,403
-Mr. Choi.
-Please leave. I have class.

227
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,239
Hold on, Mr. Choi.

228
00:13:43,322 --> 00:13:45,115
-Goodbye.
-We're not done--

229
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:54,917
Hello?

230
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,752
Mr. Choi.

231
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,255
I've given it some thought,

232
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,840
and I think you should stop tutoring--

233
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,842
Are you boycotting me too?

234
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:06,262
No, I can't do that.

235
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,429
I'll see you later.

236
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:12,434
Why is he being so aggressive
since yesterday?

237
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,438
After being all kind to me
and confusing me for a while.

238
00:14:17,022 --> 00:14:20,693
Haeng-seon, we need to deliver
20 lunch boxes to the Hanseong Building.

239
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:21,902
Got it.

240
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,869
You're just bluffing about leaving
the All Care Program, right?

241
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,082
I don't know.

242
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,918
But I'm seriously mad about this.

243
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,005
What was so wrong with what I did
for them to come at me like this?

244
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,840
All I did was tutor one student.

245
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,509
You know how parents in this area are.

246
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,595
I do. That's what makes me
even more upset.

247
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,471
They're so overbearing and selfish.

248
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,391
If I offered to tutor their kids even now,

249
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,268
they'd line up with bags of money.

250
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,227
Of course.

251
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:57,688
That's what this is all about.

252
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,441
They're willing to break the law
for their own kids' sake,

253
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:03,903
but they'll prevent special treatment
of other kids by any means necessary.

254
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,449
Gosh.

255
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,868
The All Care moms found out?

256
00:15:10,951 --> 00:15:12,369
That Mr. Choi's tutoring you?

257
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,000
But my mom didn't mention anything.

258
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:20,628
What now?

259
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,589
I don't know.

260
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,966
Mr. Choi says it's not a problem,

261
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:27,927
but I feel anxious.

262
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,678
It's like the calm before the storm.

263
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:30,930
Hae-e!

264
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,682
Is it true?

265
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,517
Is Mr. Choi really tutoring you?

266
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:39,313
My mom says so, but it's not true, is it?

267
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,649
She's mistaken, right?

268
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,902
Dan-ji, it's true
that he's tutoring her, but--

269
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:48,072
So he really is tutoring her,

270
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,407
and you were aware of it, Sun-jae?

271
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:52,076
Jeez.

272
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:54,870
You two left me out again. Is that it?

273
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,955
-Dan-ji.
-Dan-ji.

274
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:56,997
Fine.

275
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,624
You two are both smart and mature,

276
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,377
and you get each other.

277
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:03,420
No wonder you left me out.

278
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,506
What if I ran my mouth?

279
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,175
Right?

280
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:09,927
Dan-ji.

281
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,224
Really?

282
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:19,603
Mr. Choi wants to quit
the All Care Program?

283
00:16:19,687 --> 00:16:21,772
That's what he says,

284
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:24,608
but since he's a bit emotional right now--

285
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:26,110
All right, I get it.

286
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:30,030
I'll think it over and call you back.

287
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,157
Bye.

288
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,205
What's with Choi Chi-yeol?

289
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,291
He won't back down.
I didn't see this coming.

290
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:42,835
You've rubbed him the wrong way.

291
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:44,962
Threats don't work on people
with that much pride.

292
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,630
Still, this is unacceptable.

293
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,676
The All Care Program
is the centerpiece of his career.

294
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:54,346
But he's throwing it away
just for Nam Hae-e?

295
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,390
Has he gone crazy or what?

296
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:59,893
Maybe he has, unless he has
a thing for that girl's mom.

297
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:01,603
What are you talking about?

298
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:05,649
Her husband is abroad,
but she's still married.

299
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,818
How naive are you?

300
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,820
That doesn't matter when it comes to love.

301
00:17:09,903 --> 00:17:11,739
If you're in love, you go crazy.

302
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:19,580
Jeez, Mr. Jang keeps
pestering me to lend him money.

303
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,040
I'll be right back.

304
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:29,715
Even still, what would Choi Chi-yeol
see in someone like her?

305
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:37,931
Isn't that Ms. Nam?

306
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,476
-Where?
-Over there.

307
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,518
You're right.

308
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,520
What is she doing here?

309
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:46,774
No way.

310
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,902
Oh, my God.

311
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:53,947
Hold on.

312
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,541
Hey, Mi-ok.

313
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:08,253
About that tarot reader who lives
in the same building as Mr. Choi.

314
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:10,589
Can you ask her for a favor?

315
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,721
I'm not supposed to show this to anyone.

316
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,431
I'll take responsibility.

317
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:20,474
You know me, right?

318
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,392
I'm the representative of Building 102.

319
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,061
And she's very close with me.

320
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,479
I'm sorry, sir.

321
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:27,689
But this is an emergency.

322
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,442
Play that back for a second,
and we'll be on our way.

323
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,486
We're not up to anything shady.

324
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:35,197
We're just trying to do the right thing.

325
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:39,284
Still, I'm not supposed to do this.

326
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,536
Pause it.

327
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,914
This woman.

328
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,208
That's Ms. Nam, right?

329
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,417
Yes, it's her.

330
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,837
My goodness. It really is her.

331
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,672
Oh, my.

332
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,007
And this obviously isn't
her first time here.

333
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:55,634
Look at her entering the passcode.

334
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:56,552
Goodness.

335
00:18:58,929 --> 00:19:01,223
Can we see the footage from the next day?

336
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:06,728
She's here again.

337
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,439
She's been coming here almost every day.

338
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,441
What is she carrying?

339
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,862
Has she been bringing side dishes to him?

340
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:18,073
And the containers look different
from her regular ones.

341
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:20,492
This is unbelievable.

342
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:24,621
It all finally makes sense.

343
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:28,876
Before, I didn't see any reason
why Choi Chi-yeol would tutor Hae-e.

344
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,794
But this is the reason.

345
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:33,672
They're having an affair.

346
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,091
Oh, my goodness!

347
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,134
How can this be?

348
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:39,970
Are you saying that
Haeng-seon did business in bed

349
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,471
to make Mr. Choi tutor Hae-e?

350
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:44,933
This is the scandal of the century.

351
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:50,063
Now that we've found out,
there's no going back.

352
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:53,275
As x approaches negative three,

353
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,485
the denominator approaches zero.

354
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,321
Since a limit exists,

355
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,824
the numerator also approaches zero.

356
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,787
Excuse me, Mr. Choi.

357
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,164
Yes?

358
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,833
Yesterday--

359
00:20:09,917 --> 00:20:12,294
I'm only taking questions related to math.

360
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,670
Midterms are coming up.

361
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:19,009
The formula above,
x squared plus ax plus b…

362
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,179
Mr. Choi.

363
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,475
How did it go?

364
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,018
Did the academy say anything?

365
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:30,646
No, they didn't.

366
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,065
So don't worry about it,

367
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,484
and help Hae-e prepare for her midterms.

368
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:39,196
After acing the September mock,
she must be under pressure.

369
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,951
I almost forgot. Take this.

370
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:48,705
Your eyes are bloodshot, so I figured
you couldn't sleep last night.

371
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,375
It's chrysanthemum tea.
Drink it hot before bed.

372
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:56,838
Thank you.

373
00:20:58,298 --> 00:20:59,383
And…

374
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,304
Never mind.

375
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,222
Go on.

376
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:07,849
Bye. I'll go inside.

377
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,956
Sure, she wants the best for her kid,

378
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,252
but there are lines you shouldn't cross.

379
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,256
Who knew she had an ace up her sleeve?

380
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,925
Want to see what Suaimdang is made of?

381
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:44,761
Bring it on.

382
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,599
THE PRIDE ACADEMY

383
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:54,438
DIRECTOR KANG JUN-SANG

384
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:57,858
SKYMOM.NET

385
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:58,984
BY SUAIMDANG

386
00:21:59,067 --> 00:21:59,985
What?

387
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,529
MOM OFFERS SEXUAL FAVORS IN RETURN
FOR TUTORING FROM STAR TEACHER

388
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,534
What's this?

389
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,332
-Gosh.
-Hello.

390
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,167
This is Suaimdang.

391
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:20,047
I regret to share
this disturbing news with all of you.

392
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,216
A star math teacher,

393
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,553
seduced by a certain
side dish store owner,

394
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:30,140
has been offering private tutoring
to her daughter.

395
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,602
Her husband is said
to run a business abroad.

396
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,979
Imagine how shocked he'll be
when he finds out.

397
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:39,483
In fact, the news shocks us all.

398
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,945
In addition to being disappointed
in the star teacher,

399
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,782
I have a question for the woman
who sold herself for her kid.

400
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,908
WAKE UP, SIR!
IF I WERE HER DAUGHTER, I'D CUT TIES

401
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:50,827
Is this really a mother's love?

402
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,454
A STAR CHEATER IS MORE LIKE IT

403
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,039
HER HUSBAND MUST BE DEVASTATED

404
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,752
SHE SOLD HERSELF FOR HER KID'S EDUCATION?

405
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,128
SHE'S GOING TO PAY FOR IT

406
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,129
I'M BOYCOTTING THAT STORE

407
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,422
That's Choi Chi-yeol, right?

408
00:23:02,506 --> 00:23:04,549
I'm so disappointed.

409
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,926
How could this happen?

410
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,177
SHE COULDN'T AFFORD HIM OTHERWISE

411
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,345
CHI-YEOL FELL FOR A GOLD DIGGER?

412
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:09,471
I KNOW THAT STORE. DISGUSTING!

413
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,723
A CHEATING SCANDAL? UNBELIEVABLE

414
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,315
Haeng-seon, there's a problem.
Come look at this.

415
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,233
What happened?

416
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,193
What is this?

417
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,237
Oh, my.

418
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:29,157
I went to get coffee,

419
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:32,911
and a bunch of women seemed
to be gossiping about our store,

420
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,204
so I got curious and…

421
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:41,878
Unbelievable.

422
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,256
Damn it.

423
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,633
What? What are you going to do?

424
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,927
If she wants a fight, I'll give her one.

425
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,887
Haeng-seon, just talk it out.

426
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,931
No violence, okay?

427
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:01,565
All the online communities are blowing up,

428
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:04,401
and streamers are calling it
the scandal of the century.

429
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,946
Your name is the top trending search,

430
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,115
and calls are flooding in
from the parents.

431
00:24:11,324 --> 00:24:13,660
The director has called me 11 times

432
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,036
since you won't pick up.

433
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:17,622
Damn it.

434
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,083
A star teacher's scandal, my foot.

435
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,836
It's all just a load of bull.

436
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,796
Our legal team looked into it.

437
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,383
Since the post didn't reveal your identity

438
00:24:28,466 --> 00:24:31,553
and was written by an influencer,
we were advised to tread carefully.

439
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,054
Influencer, my ass.

440
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,724
Tell them to consider
all possible legal actions.

441
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,435
Make sure word doesn't spread further,

442
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,937
and delete any comments
that specify any identities.

443
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,190
Jeez.

444
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,527
"Sold herself for her kid"?

445
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:50,739
That's just plain low.

446
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,908
Where's their gender solidarity?

447
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:55,827
But the legal team is relieved

448
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,372
that the criticisms are mostly directed
at Ms. Nam rather than you--

449
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,498
That's a relief?

450
00:25:01,082 --> 00:25:02,209
Is it?

451
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,543
How could they say--

452
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,420
You know what they meant.

453
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:07,672
You're overreacting.

454
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,466
Is it because
she's your savior's daughter?

455
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,097
At least I'm used to situations like this.

456
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,352
But her?

457
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:34,407
What?

458
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,773
Oh, my goodness.

459
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:08,400
You scared me.

460
00:26:09,442 --> 00:26:11,903
Where are your manners?
You're freaking me out.

461
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,321
My manners?

462
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:18,368
I knew you were a nasty person,
but you've stepped over the line here.

463
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,288
You expect me to show manners
after writing that baseless post?

464
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,456
What do you mean, "baseless"?

465
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,250
I just wrote what I saw.

466
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:26,960
You've been frequenting his place.

467
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,963
Yes, I have.

468
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:33,508
But it's not what you think it is.

469
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,468
I've been delivering lunch boxes.

470
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:38,722
I've been making them
in exchange for him tutoring Hae-e.

471
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,392
That's how you have him
wrapped around your finger?

472
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:45,228
Who'd believe that in this situation?

473
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:47,397
Move. I have to go.

474
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,190
-Look.
-What are you doing?

475
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:50,567
I'm not done yet.

476
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,737
-Move.
-Wait.

477
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,696
I said, move.

478
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,989
-Wait.
-Get off me.

479
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,657
-Gosh.
-I'm not done--

480
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:58,867
I said, get off me!

481
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:04,372
Hello, Mr. Choi.

482
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,333
Have you seen what Suaimdang wrote?

483
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:09,544
Yes, I came to her place
to confront her, but she took off.

484
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:13,214
That won't work.
She must be willing to go all out.

485
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,677
Listen. How about I…

486
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:20,180
post an explanation?

487
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,265
That I've been delivering
lunch boxes to you.

488
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:24,267
No, don't do anything for now.

489
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,436
There's a good chance
that would only backfire,

490
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,313
plus it would reveal your identity.

491
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:31,608
You and Hae-e should stay off
social media for the time being.

492
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,779
Still, this doesn't make any sense.
It's also causing you so much--

493
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,281
Please. Do as I say just this once.

494
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,950
I'll be in touch.

495
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,790
Gosh, that little…

496
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:52,962
CHOI CHI-YEOL IN AN AFFAIR
WITH SIDE DISH STORE OWNER

497
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,048
Gosh.

498
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:58,426
Hey.

499
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,303
Help me out with this one.

500
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,930
What's with Old Korean?

501
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,848
I don't understand a word.

502
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,184
It looks like a foreign language to me.

503
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:08,770
Hey.

504
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:13,608
Hey, Hae-e.

505
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,152
Help me out here.

506
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,029
Sorry. Later.

507
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:21,324
Where are you going?

508
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:23,368
Later when?

509
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:24,994
Hey, Hae-e!

510
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:28,832
I'll help you. What is it?

511
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:30,959
So it's Goryeo poetry.

512
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:34,629
Did something happen to her?

513
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:36,464
What's with her?

514
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,966
Focus.

515
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,348
Hello, sir.

516
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,934
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

517
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,853
Did you see what Suaimdang wrote?

518
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:52,313
I mean, on Skymom.net.

519
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:00,697
Did you see?

520
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,866
Don't cry. Are you okay?

521
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,215
It's freezing in here.

522
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:20,592
Let's turn the AC down.

523
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,227
We'll keep the AC on full blast
for your burning passion for learning.

524
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,646
Question number 15.

525
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,106
It's on cubic functions.

526
00:29:35,732 --> 00:29:40,528
Even still, how could we have
absolutely no customers?

527
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,908
What do our side dishes have to do
with that damn post?

528
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:48,495
Fine, I don't even want them to come!

529
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,581
The scandal of the century, my foot.

530
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:53,708
Them and their dirty minds.

531
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,085
Talk about a witch hunt.

532
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,129
What an interesting turn of events.

533
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,297
A cheating scandal?

534
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,591
And it involves me?

535
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,675
Tell me about it.

536
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,677
Hey, don't worry.

537
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,304
You have nothing to be ashamed of.

538
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:09,265
I know you're innocent. So does God.

539
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:13,770
I mean, how could she brand you
as a cheater over a little tutoring?

540
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,897
I thought she was a friend!

541
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:18,316
Su-hui, Suaimdang,
or whatever she's called.

542
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,819
I never liked her in the first place.

543
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,987
No matter how upset she was,

544
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,572
-the kids are--
-Jae-woo's here.

545
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,407
-Hi, Jae-woo.
-Hey.

546
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,534
Hi.

547
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:30,286
Why are there no customers?

548
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:33,248
Our peak hours are usually
from 5 p.m. to 6 p.m.

549
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,124
That's why I hurried back from my walk.

550
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,210
It's just one of those days.

551
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,712
I think you can go upstairs
and get some rest.

552
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:41,089
No, I'll stay.

553
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,132
You never know when
customers will swarm in.

554
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,809
Welcome to Mr. Popular's World.

555
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:57,063
It's Mr. Popular here,
and I deliver hot news faster than anyone.

556
00:30:57,146 --> 00:30:58,606
Our hottest topic today is

557
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,317
the lady who managed
to seduce a star teacher.

558
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,987
I, Mr. Popular,
with my unrivaled deductive skills,

559
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,822
repeatedly racked my brain

560
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:09,325
to figure out
where her side dish store is.

561
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,368
And…

562
00:31:10,994 --> 00:31:11,995
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

563
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:12,912
…here we are.

564
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:13,830
Wow.

565
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:17,917
Solely to serve the public interest
and for no personal gain,

566
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,544
I'm about to reveal her identity.

567
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,590
The moment I reach 250,000 viewers,
I'll show you her face.

568
00:31:23,673 --> 00:31:25,049
No one else can do this.

569
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,551
Come on in, guys.

570
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,429
Shiba Inu, thanks for your 100,000 won.

571
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:30,471
Thanks, Kkobi.

572
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,599
Here they come. Come on in.

573
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,853
We've reached 250,000 viewers,
so here we go.

574
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,022
Let's get it.

575
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,523
-HURRY UP
-GO IN ALREADY

576
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:41,983
-CAN'T WAIT
-IS THIS NOKEUN-RO?

577
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,401
-HE'S GOING IN
-I'M A FAN NOW

578
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,819
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

579
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,904
Hello.

580
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,697
Who's the owner here?

581
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,032
Are you filming this?

582
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:51,326
-What's…
-Wait a second.

583
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,620
I have a feeling
this lady here is the owner.

584
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,747
I don't know what to say.

585
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,206
What does Chi-yeol see in her?

586
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,834
-What are you doing? Turn that off!
-Wait!

587
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,961
-Say hi to my viewers, ma'am!
-Turn it off! Get out!

588
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,087
Is the rumor true?

589
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:05,840
No, it's not true! Stop filming and leave!

590
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,133
-It's not true?
-Go away!

591
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,761
-What's your secret?
-Stop it!

592
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,435
Stop it!

593
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:21,147
Man, this live stream is insane.

594
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,317
Rumor has it that the lady is
the mom of Class 1's homeroom rep.

595
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:27,403
-Her mom runs a side dish store.
-That's right.

596
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,404
You mean Nam Hae-e.

597
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,865
You're right. It must be her mom.

598
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:32,325
Hey, Nam Hae-e!

599
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:36,120
Your mom's on Mr. Popular's
live stream right now.

600
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,413
That's her, right?

601
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:40,583
You're lucky to have such a sexy mom.

602
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:42,835
How else would you be tutored
by a star teacher?

603
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:44,212
What?

604
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,007
Just ignore them. Let's go.

605
00:32:48,716 --> 00:32:49,926
Who's this guy?

606
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,886
Oh, are you hitting on him?

607
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,514
Like mother, like daughter. Impressive.

608
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:56,766
Should I ask my mom too?

609
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:57,976
-Sounds good.
-Right?

610
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,022
Jeez, what the hell?

611
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,273
What?

612
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,526
Hey,

613
00:33:06,609 --> 00:33:08,945
go ask your mom
to teach you to watch your mouth.

614
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:10,947
Grow up, will you?

615
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,957
Hey, that's enough. Move.

616
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,338
Hey.

617
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:30,758
Let's stop here. Everyone's watching.

618
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,301
Hey.

619
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:39,600
Didn't I tell you to stop, you punk?

620
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,274
You little…

621
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:51,946
Get up.

622
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:56,409
Does that hurt?

623
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:57,493
Does it?

624
00:33:58,244 --> 00:33:59,245
Clean up.

625
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:03,708
Go away.

626
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:10,548
You okay?

627
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,009
Forget it.

628
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:30,276
Why would you get into a fight
at a time like this?

629
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,029
You guys are almost seniors.

630
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:36,157
Lee Sun-jae.

631
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,492
This isn't like you.

632
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,078
Are you under a lot of stress?

633
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,415
Go to the counselor's office
and write a letter of apology.

634
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,000
A full page.

635
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,127
Include the Five Ws and One H.

636
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:49,921
Understand?

637
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:50,963
Yes, sir.

638
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,090
Okay.

639
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:04,560
Mr. Jeon.

640
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:06,813
I heard it's about Hae-e.

641
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:10,108
I'm talking about
that star teacher's scandal.

642
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:12,401
Wait a second.

643
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:15,571
She got first place in the September mock.

644
00:35:16,656 --> 00:35:18,533
So that's what happened.

645
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,786
She did make her mom's efforts worth it,

646
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,372
but I'm not sure
if she deserves a compliment.

647
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:28,167
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

648
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:30,461
Shouldn't we get back to work?

649
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,012
The scandal itself was bad enough,

650
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:41,389
but now a live stream?

651
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,100
People are so mean.

652
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:47,645
He's using other people's misfortune
to make money.

653
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,065
He's just trying to make ends meet.

654
00:35:51,649 --> 00:35:53,943
Are you defending that jerk
in this situation?

655
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:57,280
-Everyone knows what you look like now.
-I know, you brat.

656
00:35:57,363 --> 00:35:58,739
No need to rub it in.

657
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:05,329
Jae-woo, are you okay?

658
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,129
Jae-woo.

659
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,758
Jae-woo.

660
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,594
Oh, my.

661
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,846
Yeong-ju! Come help me.

662
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,556
Jae-woo! Hey!

663
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,849
-Hold him.
-What's wrong with him?

664
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,559
-Jae-woo!
-Come here.

665
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,269
-Jae-woo.
-Hey.

666
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,312
Let's sit him down.

667
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,374
LETTER OF APOLOGY
THE JERK DESSERVED IT

668
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:54,754
What?

669
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,049
Hey.

670
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,594
I bet he'll make you write another one.

671
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:03,846
Also,

672
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:08,226
"deserve" has one "s," not two.

673
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:12,188
Thanks, smarty-pants.

674
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,445
Gosh, whatever.

675
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:22,073
I'll just take the punishment. I give up.

676
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,709
What are you doing?

677
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,129
I'll have to write like a little kid
to sound like you, right?

678
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,757
Misspell words here and there too.

679
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,093
This is annoying.

680
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:46,222
You made my heart skip a beat
for a second there.

681
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,057
What are you saying, you nutjob?

682
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:50,977
What are you smirking at?

683
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:52,853
What the hell?

684
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,230
You write it. I'm disgusted.

685
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,400
Come on, keep going. You're good.

686
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:01,529
-Have you gone crazy?
-No.

687
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,948
Gosh.

688
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,794
Are you okay?

689
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,797
You weren't like yourself back there.

690
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,049
You should've been the one
punching those jerks.

691
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:23,884
Or maybe I should've.

692
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,471
Why was I born, Dan-ji?

693
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,640
My mere existence is a nuisance.

694
00:38:29,724 --> 00:38:30,683
Both to my friends…

695
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:32,810
and to my mom.

696
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:33,936
Nonsense.

697
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,147
Don't beat yourself up.

698
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,149
You didn't do anything wrong.

699
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,484
But I did.

700
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:42,987
It's all my fault.

701
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:48,534
My mom didn't do anything wrong.

702
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:49,994
I know.

703
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:51,996
I believe her.

704
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,249
Thanks.

705
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,669
I'm sorry…

706
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,339
for hurting you too.

707
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:02,965
Forget it.

708
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,550
You really hurt me this time.

709
00:39:05,134 --> 00:39:08,304
If you two leave me out in the future,
I won't ever see you again.

710
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:12,266
So if there are any more secrets,
tell me right now.

711
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,269
At times,

712
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:19,190
a secret can turn into a weapon.

713
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,274
What?

714
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,734
Are there more secrets or not?

715
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:27,740
Hi, Auntie. What is it?

716
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,327
What?

717
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,497
…the left-hand limit
as x approaches negative one.

718
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,626
Since we approach from the left,
the correct answer is negative two.

719
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:41,754
It's important to distinguish between
right- and left-hand limits,

720
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,172
but be careful with the graphs.

721
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:45,257
You have to read the graphs correctly.

722
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,593
-That's all for today.
-I have a question, sir!

723
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:50,721
If it's about the material,
ask my assistants.

724
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,515
It's a personal question.

725
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:54,100
What do you look for in a woman?

726
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,479
Is personality more important than looks?

727
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,398
Or perhaps you have peculiar taste?

728
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,821
-Mr. Popular?
-Yes.

729
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,323
He has quite a few subscribers,
and he live streamed…

730
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:11,867
So he barged into her store?

731
00:40:11,951 --> 00:40:13,494
He pushed his way in.

732
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,705
And the screenshots of Ms. Nam
are spreading around online….

733
00:40:17,331 --> 00:40:19,375
Where are you going? Mr. Choi!

734
00:40:21,001 --> 00:40:21,961
Goodness.

735
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,967
We're closed.

736
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:29,301
Where's Ms. Nam?

737
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,137
She's not here? She won't pick up.

738
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:35,182
There's been an emergency.

739
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:44,859
You should go home.

740
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,446
The doctor said his heart was fine,
so don't worry.

741
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,825
He is sedated and will probably
sleep through the night.

742
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:57,621
Don't let that live stream
or whatever get to you.

743
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,207
This will all blow over in a few days.

744
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:04,170
Auntie.

745
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,299
Why "Auntie," all of a sudden?
You're scaring me.

746
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,428
-How about I tell everyone--
-Be quiet.

747
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:17,683
Set your alarm and don't skip breakfast.

748
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,651
You too, Auntie.

749
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:30,154
There you go again, you brat.

750
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,199
Lock up before you go to bed.
I'll call you tomorrow.

751
00:41:50,758 --> 00:41:51,842

MESSAGE BOARD

752
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:52,760
NEW POST

753
00:41:58,641 --> 00:41:59,850
Hello.

754
00:41:59,934 --> 00:42:03,896
I'm the daughter of the woman
rumored to be dating the star teacher.

755
00:42:07,149 --> 00:42:08,484
That wasn't a long wait.

756
00:42:08,984 --> 00:42:11,737
I have a confession to make.

757
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:12,947
I'm hungry.

758
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,323
-How about tteokbokki?
-Tteokbokki?

759
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,866
I'm craving hot pot too.

760
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,451
Is there any place that's open?

761
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:19,787
Let's just have tteokbokki. Some udon too.

762
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,581
-Sure. Near our place?
-Yes.

763
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,917
-Should we have gimbap too?
-Sounds good.

764
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,297
Se-na.

765
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,388
This is between you and me.

766
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,057
The thing is…

767
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,770
my mom isn't my real mom.

768
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,815
She's actually my aunt.

769
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:49,775
Really?

770
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:52,111
I've never even seen my dad.

771
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:53,946
My real mom

772
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:56,282
ran off when I was five.

773
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:57,491
She abandoned me.

774
00:42:57,575 --> 00:42:59,368
I had no idea.

775
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,580
It must've been tough for you.

776
00:43:03,664 --> 00:43:05,958
I cried a lot at first.

777
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,962
But with time, I got used to it.

778
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:14,341
My aunt is my savior.

779
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:19,930
You're incredible,

780
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:22,057
Hae-e.

781
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:29,398
I heard Nam Hae-e is an orphan.

782
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:30,399
Is that true?

783
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,067
Se-na told me

784
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:34,486
that her mom is actually her aunt.

785
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,738
What?

786
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:38,657
So she's been pretending all this time?

787
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,702
She's totally two-faced.
She must be a sociopath.

788
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:35,881
Hae-e!

789
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:38,884
Were you at the hospital? How's your mom?

790
00:44:38,967 --> 00:44:39,968
Auntie Yeong-ju.

791
00:44:43,347 --> 00:44:44,640
What's wrong, Hae-e?

792
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,475
What is it?

793
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:48,143
I heard your uncle is fine.

794
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:51,814
Are you shaken up about that live stream?

795
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,445
Why am I so selfish, Auntie?

796
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,449
If I tell the truth,

797
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:06,328
Mom wouldn't be misunderstood,
and Mr. Choi wouldn't suffer like this.

798
00:45:10,582 --> 00:45:12,334
But I don't have the courage.

799
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:18,841
I hate myself.

800
00:45:18,924 --> 00:45:21,593
Don't say that. It's not your fault.

801
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:25,347
It's all the grown-ups' fault.

802
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,114
Click that.

803
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:43,615
-This?
-Yes.

804
00:45:46,702 --> 00:45:47,953
I think that's her.

805
00:45:51,832 --> 00:45:52,833
It's her, right?

806
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,645
What are you doing here?

807
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:18,192
How is he? What did the doctor say?

808
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:21,111
He's fine. He seems to have had
a panic attack due to stress.

809
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:22,613
He's sedated now.

810
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:29,536
-Where's Hae-e?
-She just went home.

811
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:31,747
Why would you come here out of the blue?

812
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,749
You should be careful at a time like this.

813
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,585
It's not like you've
never disguised yourself before.

814
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,755
I was just so worried.

815
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:47,262
What about dinner?

816
00:46:47,346 --> 00:46:48,388
Have you eaten?

817
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,202
I didn't know what you'd like.

818
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,832
You don't strike me as picky, though.

819
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:19,836
Why are we here?
There's a store in the hospital too.

820
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:22,256
People might recognize you.

821
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:24,800
Eat comfortably in the car.

822
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:58,750
This triangle gimbap is really good.

823
00:47:59,960 --> 00:48:01,628
I must've been hungry.

824
00:48:02,379 --> 00:48:04,464
I never eat more than two,

825
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,301
but I can't stop eating these.

826
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:09,928
Eat up.

827
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,016
Should I?

828
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:26,862
So this is why celebrities
have dates in their cars.

829
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:29,865
I feel like a celebrity.

830
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:31,867
This is fun.

831
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:43,879
But I'm not saying
we're on a date or anything.

832
00:48:44,838 --> 00:48:46,757
I was just making a comparison.

833
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,416
Are you done? Do you want--

834
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,804
Goodness.

835
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:36,807
She falls asleep anywhere.

836
00:49:41,311 --> 00:49:42,979
So carefree.

837
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,055
You should've woken me up.

838
00:52:22,931 --> 00:52:23,765
I…

839
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:27,853
I don't usually fall into a food coma,
but it's been an eventful day.

840
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:32,148
I don't always fall asleep
anywhere like this.

841
00:52:32,232 --> 00:52:34,693
I'm surprisingly sensitive, you know. But…

842
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,487
I can't believe
I just passed out like that.

843
00:52:44,953 --> 00:52:47,539
So this is how
the Han River looks at night.

844
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:49,708
Beautiful, isn't it?

845
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,844
I have feelings…

846
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:03,972
for this woman.

847
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:32,292
Mr. Choi.

848
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:34,878
Well…

849
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:38,048
I'm sorry to bring this up
in this situation,

850
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:44,512
but about what I asked you the other day…

851
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:47,515
I have…

852
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,145
something to tell you too.

853
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:03,949
I'll stop

854
00:54:04,532 --> 00:54:05,617
tutoring Hae-e.

855
00:54:06,326 --> 00:54:07,202
Sorry?

856
00:54:10,455 --> 00:54:12,165
I'll stop teaching her.

857
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:15,210
I think that's best.

858
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,219
You're right.

859
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:27,222
It's probably for the best.

860
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:30,600
It did cross my mind too.

861
00:54:30,684 --> 00:54:34,020
Looking back on it now,
you must've emphasized confidentiality

862
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,772
because you'd seen this coming.

863
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:38,358
But I never imagined this.

864
00:54:39,067 --> 00:54:40,819
I should've known better.

865
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:47,158
Yes, I think we should stop here.

866
00:54:53,456 --> 00:54:54,708
What about the lunch boxes?

867
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:57,627
I could have Jae-woo deliver them.

868
00:54:57,711 --> 00:54:58,753
No.

869
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:01,423
I'll find another store.

870
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:07,095
Okay.

871
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,371
Mr. Choi.

872
00:55:35,123 --> 00:55:36,750
Thank you for everything.

873
00:55:39,085 --> 00:55:42,088
Thank you for giving Hae-e a chance.

874
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:47,177
And thank you for being
so patient with Jae-woo.

875
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:51,222
Also, I'm really touched
that you made sure I ate today.

876
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:58,646
It's a shame that
I'll never get to repay your kindness.

877
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:02,233
But I wish you the best.

878
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,069
Good luck.

879
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,009
Ms. Nam.

880
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:47,862
You forgot this.

881
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,322
Right.

882
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,575
You bought all this for me.

883
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,037
I'll give it to Jae-woo when he wakes up.

884
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:02,418
Take care.

885
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,963
Okay, you too.

886
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,465
Thank you for everything.

887
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:36,369
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

888
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,920
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

889
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:46,963
Hi.

890
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:48,590
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

891
00:57:48,673 --> 00:57:50,675
The talk show has been scheduled.

892
00:57:50,758 --> 00:57:52,635
Monday the week after next at 6 p.m.

893
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:55,805
They've already asked the host
not to take any questions

894
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,599
about your scandal.

895
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,392
Okay.

896
00:57:59,476 --> 00:58:02,979
I also need a copy of the midterm workbook
for Woorim High School.

897
00:58:03,563 --> 00:58:05,565
But the prep course
doesn't start until next week.

898
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:06,900
It's for Hae-e.

899
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:10,278
I'm quitting tutoring her.

900
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:15,241
You made the right decision.
That's best for now.

901
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:17,368
What about the All Care Program?

902
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,288
They seem to be having regrets as well.

903
00:58:20,371 --> 00:58:22,207
To keep me in the program,

904
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:25,168
Suaimdang will have to
take down her post first.

905
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:28,254
That might be enough to turn the tide.

906
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,550
And I have another favor to ask.

907
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,093
It's coffee, but cheers.

908
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:35,637
I quit drinking.

909
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,555
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

910
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:40,725
Su-hui, you're one amazing strategist.

911
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:44,103
I was so worried
Choi Chi-yeol wouldn't cave.

912
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,689
Same here. He wouldn't budge at first.

913
00:58:46,773 --> 00:58:49,067
Our boycott really worked.

914
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,278
Suaimdang is the queen of negotiations!

915
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,240
We should just elect her
to the National Assembly!

916
00:58:56,157 --> 00:58:56,991
Great idea.

917
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,204
I can't take all the credit.

918
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,706
I couldn't have done it without your help.

919
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:06,626
Are we finished?

920
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,379
Then I'll get going.

921
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:10,922
I have a meeting.

922
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:12,840
Okay.

923
00:59:13,341 --> 00:59:14,551
-See you.
-You're so busy.

924
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,427
-Let's go for a drink sometime.
-Bye.

925
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,389
One would think she won a war.

926
00:59:21,766 --> 00:59:22,850
What did she say?

927
00:59:23,434 --> 00:59:24,519
Am I hearing things?

928
00:59:24,602 --> 00:59:25,520
What did she say?

929
00:59:25,603 --> 00:59:30,650
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

930
00:59:33,444 --> 00:59:34,612
Thank you.

931
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:40,326
Jae-woo.

932
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:42,120
Stop scaring us like that, will you?

933
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:43,705
Drink this.

934
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:45,790
It's good for you.

935
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:47,917
It's too bitter, so I don't like it.

936
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:50,086
Just drink it.

937
00:59:50,169 --> 00:59:51,963
Mom says good medicine tastes bitter.

938
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,972
-Hae-e.
-Yes?

939
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,140
Well…

940
01:00:02,724 --> 01:00:05,226
I talked to Mr. Choi yesterday.

941
01:00:08,313 --> 01:00:09,480
About the tutoring…

942
01:00:10,356 --> 01:00:11,274
Yes?

943
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:13,776
Oh, my.

944
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,194
-Hi.
-Hello.

945
01:00:15,278 --> 01:00:16,654
-Hello.
-Hello.

946
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,073
These past few days
must have been tough for you.

947
01:00:19,782 --> 01:00:21,075
Of course, they have.

948
01:00:21,159 --> 01:00:23,953
Even I'm exhausted
watching my friend suffer.

949
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:28,833
Right.

950
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,755
This is from Mr. Choi.

951
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:36,841
It'll help Hae-e prepare for her midterms.

952
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,426
I see.

953
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:41,721
It might not be easy for her
to maintain Level 1 on her own.

954
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:45,892
I suggest she sign up for online classes
or another academy.

955
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,436
-Goodbye, then.
-Thank you.

956
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:49,937
Bye.

957
01:00:51,105 --> 01:00:52,482
Goodbye.

958
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:57,612
Haeng-seon, what was that about?

959
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,197
Is Chi-yeol not coming anymore?

960
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:01,032
Go upstairs and get some rest.

961
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:03,785
-Here, Hae-e.
-Thanks.

962
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:08,873
-Let's get to work.
-Okay. Go on upstairs.

963
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:37,985
We need to find the three lowest points
of S sub n of negative 49.

964
01:01:38,069 --> 01:01:39,153
First…

965
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:44,701
There you go.

966
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,785
Second…

967
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,374
That's it.

968
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,625
Let's move on.

THE CSAT MIRACLE BY CHOI CHI-YEOL
D-30 KICK-OFF

974
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:54,187
It's chilly, isn't it?

975
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,647
The temperature plunges
in the mornings and evenings.

976
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,649
Yes, it's become quite cold.

977
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:03,237
Why did you buy so much?
Things are slow these days.

978
01:03:03,321 --> 01:03:05,656
Our sales have recovered halfway.
That's something.

979
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:07,408
Glass half-full, right?

980
01:03:08,201 --> 01:03:10,912
By the way, he hasn't been back here once.

981
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:12,455
Who?

982
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,166
Who else? Your alleged lover.

983
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,919
I understand he needs to lie low,

984
01:03:18,002 --> 01:03:19,712
but he sure made a clean break.

985
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,882
He could have Mr. Ji
pick up lunch boxes for him.

986
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:24,926
I'm sure he's found
another store he likes.

987
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,928
Now go put away the groceries.

988
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:28,554
Yes, ma'am.

989
01:03:34,227 --> 01:03:36,771
Should I find another academy for Hae-e?

990
01:03:38,815 --> 01:03:41,692
The winter break before senior year
is supposed to be important.

991
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:48,157
CSAT MATH

992
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,119
An "admission talk show"? What's that?

993
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,204
4TH ADMISSION TALK SHOW

994
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,206
Hold on. This is today.

995
01:03:56,374 --> 01:03:57,625
Let's see here.

996
01:03:58,209 --> 01:04:00,503
"ACC Convention Center."

997
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:03,089
"At 6 p.m."

998
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:04,841
Come out, Haeng-seon.

999
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:07,260
The owner at Si-won's brought cabbages.

1000
01:04:07,343 --> 01:04:08,553
Already?

1001
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:19,480
THE SHOW WILL ONCE AGAIN BE HOSTED
BY MATH TEACHER CHOI CHI-YEOL

1002
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:34,287
4TH ADMISSION TALK SHOW

1003
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:47,633
-Excuse me. Let me…
-Sure.

1004
01:04:56,017 --> 01:04:57,852
MATH TEACHER CHOI CHI-YEOL

1005
01:04:58,853 --> 01:05:00,062
Hello, everyone.

1006
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:02,690
CHOI CHI-YEOL
Q&amp;A WITH A STAR TEACHER

1007
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,401
Welcome to the Admission Talk Show.

1008
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:07,737
I'm Han Tae-hwa,
your host for the evening.

1009
01:05:10,865 --> 01:05:13,492
All right. Let's get right into it.

1010
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,953
Today's guest is a teacher,

1011
01:05:16,037 --> 01:05:19,248
and he'll answer all our questions
and soothe our worries.

1012
01:05:19,332 --> 01:05:20,875
"For math, Choi Chi-yeol."

1013
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:23,252
Please welcome the star teacher,
Mr. Choi Chi-yeol!

1014
01:05:33,888 --> 01:05:37,141
Everyone knows who you are,
but please introduce yourself.

1015
01:05:39,226 --> 01:05:44,190
When it comes to math, it's important
to look for the answers on your own.

1016
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:46,192
It develops your thinking skills.

1017
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,321
And it's a lot more beneficial

1018
01:05:50,404 --> 01:05:53,115
to spend an hour
solving a single problem yourself

1019
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:55,826
than to memorize the answers
to ten problems.

1020
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:59,538
That's both the goal and the fun
of studying math.

1021
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,249
All right.

1022
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:06,837
I think we only have enough time
to take two more questions.

1023
01:06:06,921 --> 01:06:09,048
Let's take one from the front this time.

1024
01:06:09,131 --> 01:06:10,967
The lady dressed in white, go ahead.

1025
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:13,302
Please pass her the mic.

1026
01:06:15,554 --> 01:06:16,597
All right.

1027
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:17,640
Hello.

1028
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:20,851
My daughter is in tenth grade.

1029
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:23,396
As she starts to prepare for the CSAT,

1030
01:06:23,479 --> 01:06:26,273
we're choosing a teacher for each subject.

1031
01:06:27,358 --> 01:06:28,776
For math,

1032
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:31,862
our first choice is
obviously you, Mr. Choi.

1033
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,030
That's very wise.

1034
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:36,242
With that being said,
I have The Pride in mind,

1035
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,369
and we even aim for the All Care Program.

1036
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:44,417
But I can't be too careful
when it comes to my kid's education.

1037
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:47,253
I'll be blunt.

1038
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:51,507
You've recently been involved
in a disgraceful scandal.

1039
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:54,677
No personal questions, please.

1040
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:56,762
Let's focus on college admissions.

1041
01:06:57,388 --> 01:07:00,516
But everyone in this room
must know about it anyway.

1042
01:07:00,599 --> 01:07:02,977
Why don't you explain yourself
once and for all here

1043
01:07:03,060 --> 01:07:05,563
and protect your reputation?

1044
01:07:05,646 --> 01:07:06,772
Hold on.

1045
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,568
Why should he have to explain?

1046
01:07:11,819 --> 01:07:16,741
All he did was make a kind gesture
to a mistreated student.

1047
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:20,619
If anyone should explain,
that woman who came on to him should.

1048
01:07:21,328 --> 01:07:25,708
Famous people tend to
attract gold diggers.

1049
01:07:25,791 --> 01:07:26,876
Don't you know that?

1050
01:07:27,585 --> 01:07:29,920
Use your common sense.

1051
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,131
Why would Mr. Choi do such a thing?

1052
01:07:32,673 --> 01:07:34,425
With his social status and everything,

1053
01:07:35,092 --> 01:07:36,427
he's way out of her league--

1054
01:07:36,510 --> 01:07:38,971
That's why I don't understand.

1055
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,932
Why would someone as well-known as him

1056
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,143
lead her on and give her
that kind of hope?

1057
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:46,187
You really don't get it.

1058
01:07:47,021 --> 01:07:49,148
Did you even read the post?

1059
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:52,735
Look at it in context.

1060
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:54,904
He didn't lead her on.

1061
01:07:54,987 --> 01:07:59,075
She's the one who made a move
and threw herself at him--

1062
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,201
It's not like that.

1063
01:08:06,832 --> 01:08:08,584
I offered to tutor the student.

1064
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:13,506
And I'm the one who had feelings.

1065
01:08:14,715 --> 01:08:15,716
Not her.

1066
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,013
She only treated me as a teacher,

1067
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,225
so I'm the one at fault.

1068
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,522
I never deserved her.

1069
01:08:32,608 --> 01:08:34,151
She is extremely kind-hearted

1070
01:08:35,528 --> 01:08:37,488
and shines so brightly.

1071
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:42,701
I had a crush on her.

1072
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,081
So please mind your words.

1073
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:32,751
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1074
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:34,712
What is Choi Chi-yeol saying?

1075
01:09:34,795 --> 01:09:36,714
He had a crush on her?

1076
01:09:36,797 --> 01:09:38,632
We trusted Mr. Choi!

1077
01:09:38,716 --> 01:09:41,093
You even took the fall
for the scandal. Why?

1078
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:42,261
I like you.

1079
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:45,931
His phone's turned off, and he's not home.

1080
01:09:46,015 --> 01:09:48,058
I was wondering if you could reach him.

1081
01:09:48,142 --> 01:09:50,352
I know I shouldn't have feelings for you.

1082
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:52,771
I'm the one who found
the wrong answer again.

1083
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:53,981
I'll end it.

1084
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:56,817
I must've liked him.

1085
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,612
I must've liked him a lot, Yeong-ju.

1086
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:10,748
