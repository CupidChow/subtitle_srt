1
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:42,936
What?

3
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,729
Why are you here at this hour?

4
00:01:44,813 --> 00:01:48,483
I saw this long line
outside a donut shop and got curious.

5
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:49,734
Here's a snack for you.

6
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:52,821
-I was actually craving something sweet.
-Really?

7
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,240
Wow, they look delicious!

8
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,324
-Don't they?
-Yes.

9
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,327
They smell so good.

10
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,713
Someone else killed him.

11
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:14,342
I'm a witness.

12
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,683
Do you mean you witnessed the murder?

13
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:24,769
Your Honor, let's briefly adjourn--

14
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:25,937
Yes.

15
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,023
I followed him.

16
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,826
I used to feed some stray cats.

17
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,912
But all of a sudden,

18
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,748
they started to get killed or injured…

19
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,967
by metal balls shot by someone.

20
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:02,098
So I was patrolling the area
to catch the culprit.

21
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:39,260
Why are you doing this to me?

22
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,470
Don't come near me!

23
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,180
Don't come near me!

24
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:44,724
Please don't do this.

25
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,143
Don't come near me.

26
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,343
So?

27
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,303
Did you see the culprit's face?

28
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:26,641
No. His cap was pulled over his face.

29
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,269
But…

30
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,479
the hands that were choking me

31
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,065
were long and white.

32
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,402
And his index finger

33
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,239
was calloused.

34
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,325
-"Calloused"?
-Yes.

35
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:48,246
It was extremely hard and rough.

36
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,498
Can you look at question number four?

37
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,003
I think this should be two,

38
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:56,796
not negative two.

39
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:04,137
The suspect's account is pretty detailed.

40
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,181
Wasn't this investigated beforehand?

41
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:08,224
He hasn't…

42
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,893
talked about this before.

43
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:13,313
Your Honor.

44
00:05:13,396 --> 00:05:16,691
From early on,
the police suspected my client

45
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,902
without any solid evidence.

46
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,740
And they remained prejudiced
throughout the investigation.

47
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:25,950
They also pressured
my mentally unstable client

48
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,578
into remaining silent about the truth.

49
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:32,248
As my client has not been proven guilty,

50
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,001
I ask you to dismiss
the arrest warrant request.

51
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:47,096
HOW WE APPROACH AN UNSOLVABLE CONJECTURE

52
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,599
All right. Pens down, everyone.

53
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,727
Pass your answer sheets forward.

54
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:58,608
READING SECTION

55
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,860
Hae-e, what are you doing?

56
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:21,756
All right.

57
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,466
Great job, everyone.

58
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:27,345
I know midterms are over,
but don't stay out too late.

59
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:29,639
That's all from me. Dismissed.

60
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,855
We're free! Let's party!

61
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,565
-I aced it.
-I'm so happy.

62
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,692
-I screwed it up.
-I totally aced it.

63
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:47,073
Sun-jae. We need to talk.

64
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,574
Hae-e, a word?

65
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:52,453
-Sun-jae--
-Come. We need to talk.

66
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,996
About what?

67
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,041
How come you're the only one
who got a perfect score in math?

68
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,837
The second short answer question
even threw off Seon-ju and Jeong-a.

69
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,588
So how did you get it right?

70
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,715
It wasn't even on
the academy's practice exam.

71
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,593
What do you think? I solved it.

72
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,220
Let go of me.

73
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,849
Choi Chi-yeol and our homeroom teacher
have been friends since college.

74
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:13,975
Did they strike a deal?

75
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,560
How can you…

76
00:07:20,648 --> 00:07:23,067
You must be stressed out by the exams.

77
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,277
Just go home and sleep.

78
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:29,782
Who are you to tell me what to do?

79
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,285
-Who do you think you are?
-Hey!

80
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:33,828
-What's going on?
-Su-a!

81
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,580
-What's wrong?
-Let her go!

82
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,874
-Are you okay, Hae-e?
-What's with you?

83
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,833
Hey!

84
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,293
-Are you okay?
-Hae-e!

85
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:42,462
Hey!

86
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,473
RECENT CALLS

87
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:54,640
SUN-JAE

88
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,321
-It's so sweet.
-Right?

89
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,867
Is he the sweetest man
in the world or what?

90
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,368
But he didn't have to.

91
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:19,499
Just seeing him this morning
seemed to give you a sugar rush.

92
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,000
You saw that?

93
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:23,044
We have windows, you fool.

94
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:26,714
You two seemed so lovey-dovey
that I got jealous.

95
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,424
Anyway, this donut is really good.

96
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:30,092
I know.

97
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,102
Thank you.

98
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:50,071
It's hot.

99
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,576
You should've been careful. Slow down.

100
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,208
I'm fine.

101
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,462
Hold on.

102
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,215
What's going on here?

103
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,635
Do you owe her something, Jae-woo?

104
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:14,679
No.

105
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,016
I think you do.

106
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,060
Hey.

107
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:22,937
Do you have something on him?

108
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:25,773
-No.
-It's not like that!

109
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,692
Leave Yeong-ju alone, Haeng-seon!

110
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,281
What did I do?

111
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,616
-You…
-Right.

112
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,369
I forgot to put up the no parking sign.

113
00:09:40,871 --> 00:09:42,081
What's with that brat?

114
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:44,458
No idea.

115
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,376
Gosh, it's cold.

116
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:56,971
Jae-woo.

117
00:09:58,055 --> 00:09:59,974
Why are you walking on eggshells
around me?

118
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,560
No, I'm not.

119
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:04,228
You are, you little brat.

120
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,480
Even that dull Haeng-seon caught on.

121
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,609
Is this about yesterday?

122
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,278
Yeong-ju.

123
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:14,238
I think I made a mistake yesterday.

124
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,617
What I meant by "gross" was…

125
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,909
Come on.

126
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:21,996
It was the alcohol talking.
Don't dwell on it.

127
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:24,123
Don't you know how I am?

128
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,167
I'm careless and whimsical.

129
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,252
And I like all men.

130
00:10:28,336 --> 00:10:29,962
I know that, but…

131
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:33,841
You take everything too seriously.

132
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,801
What should I do with you?

133
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,055
Stop it. Just go back to normal.

134
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,431
Hey, Jae-woo.

135
00:10:42,099 --> 00:10:43,809
This is a warning.

136
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:56,947
COURT

137
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:05,331
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

138
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:06,999
You made a fool of me in court.

139
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,210
You never asked.

140
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,338
-What?
-You suspected me from the beginning.

141
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:14,840
Like those cops.

142
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,181
Where are you going? The car's that way.

143
00:11:37,113 --> 00:11:38,322
Hi, Sun-jae.

144
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:44,620
What on earth did you do, Mom?

145
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:47,623
Lower your voice.

146
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,001
-You want everyone to find out?
-Mom.

147
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:54,213
Did you double-check your answer sheets?

148
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,925
I hope you didn't make any mistakes.

149
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,970
That's not the point.

150
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:04,849
The exam questions were exactly the same
as the ones you had given me!

151
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,725
Down to a T!

152
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,853
It's what you think it is.

153
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,857
Even after I told you to study hard

154
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:17,445
and get Level 1 in Language Arts
at all costs,

155
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,613
you couldn't focus.

156
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,950
Still, how could you…

157
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,536
This isn't right.

158
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,204
This is cheating, Mom!

159
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,290
You gave me no choice!

160
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,667
You had your head in the clouds.

161
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,627
So what else could I do?

162
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,715
You must nail
both early and regular admissions.

163
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:38,632
Don't you know?

164
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,219
But still,

165
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,305
this isn't right, Mom.

166
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:47,766
I hate this.
Can't we just tell the school?

167
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,684
Please.

168
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:51,562
This is driving me crazy!

169
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:54,940
Suit yourself.

170
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,652
If you want your mom
in the hospital again.

171
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,197
No, that's not what I mean.

172
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,367
Mom, please don't do this!

173
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:22,801
NAM HAE-E

174
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,365
Your call cannot be completed…

175
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,628
Hae-e!

176
00:13:58,796 --> 00:13:59,838
What happened?

177
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,716
I thought you'd be celebrating
after your exams. Back so soon?

178
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,427
Well, I'm a little tired.

179
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,804
I see.

180
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,472
-I'll go upstairs and rest.
-Okay.

181
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,437
Did she not do well on her exam?

182
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:17,356
Why is she feeling so down?

183
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,609
Goodness.

184
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,529
Damn exams. Damn college admissions.

185
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,823
To hell with them.

186
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,242
A math camp?

187
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,913
It's called
Choi Chi-yeol's Math Camp. Wow.

188
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,835
Think of it as an upgrade
of the existing info sessions.

189
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,628
It will be a half-day

190
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,714
full of sample lectures
and math quiz shows.

191
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,465
Isn't it a great idea?

192
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:46,552
I'm not sure.
I'd rather focus my efforts on teaching

193
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,470
than host an event like that.

194
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:52,224
Why? This event could mark
your official comeback.

195
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:54,727
If we decide to do it, how big will it be?

196
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,938
I think we should have
at least 2,000 participants.

197
00:14:58,022 --> 00:14:59,940
Still, there will be even more applicants.

198
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,984
With that many people,

199
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,237
the event will have to be held
outdoors or in a gymnasium.

200
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,990
You read my mind, Mr. Ji.

201
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,951
Ms. Jung is already looking for a venue.

202
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,499
Let's do it, Mr. Choi.

203
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:21,921
This is the least I can do
when our star teacher's making a comeback.

204
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:25,424
Can't you see I put my heart and soul
into these slides?

205
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,217
What do you say, Mr. Ji?

206
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:36,018
This isn't a publicity stunt.
The aim is to refresh the kids.

207
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,686
I'm all for it, Mr. Choi.

208
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,271
I'll prepare thoroughly.

209
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,358
If that's what you think,

210
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:45,361
I'll give it a try.

211
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,071
Let's do it.

212
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,114
Okay, great!

213
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,701
Let's have a blast!

214
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,635
Open the door, Su-a.

215
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:12,680
Su-a!

216
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,140
Su-a!

217
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,102
Midterms aren't everything.

218
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:21,939
Pull yourself together
and start preparing for the finals.

219
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:23,857
You can't give up like this.

220
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,111
Open the door, come on.

221
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,990
If you keep this up, I'll be really upset.

222
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,701
Open the door, Su-a.

223
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,912
Open the door, Su-a!

224
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,125
Open the door, Bang Su-a.

225
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:52,678
Ms. Jung just called and said

226
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:55,264
Hyeseong University's gymnasium
is available

227
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,099
and has the best offer.

228
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,351
I'm checking the place out
tomorrow morning.

229
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,853
You're coming along, right?

230
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,646
I should since I said yes.

231
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,733
Is Hyeseong University in Gangbuk?

232
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:09,236
Yes, it's a 40-minute drive.

233
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,904
I'll pick you up in the morning.

234
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,116
Once you get back,
you have online classes to record--

235
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,284
Hold on.

236
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,373
Hey.

237
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,129
What? Is that too informal of a way
to greet someone older than me?

238
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,758
No, I just got off work.

239
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:33,719
I'm tied up with course preparations.

240
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,096
We're doing a math camp
instead of an info session,

241
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,556
and there's a lot to prepare.

242
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,267
I'm recording online classes tomorrow too.

243
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,062
Gosh.

244
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,981
It feels like torture
getting back to work after a break.

245
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,067
Guess I'm not capable of taking one.

246
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,235
Shall I stop by?

247
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,283
Yes, I am tired, but I could…

248
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:58,410
What is this?

249
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,789
Are you worried about me
or trying to get rid of me?

250
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,751
Okay, then I'll go home and rest.

251
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,960
By the way,

252
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,462
how did Hae-e's exam go?

253
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,298
It seemed she did well in math yesterday.

254
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,676
Oh, no. How badly did she flunk it?

255
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,262
How bad?

256
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,370
Man.

257
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,997
The place feels completely different
now that I'm alone.

258
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:48,127
It's unnecessarily spacious.

259
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,462
It only makes me cold.

260
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,006
Gosh, it's cold.

261
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,888
What?

262
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:05,102
Is this why they told me
to have it checked?

263
00:19:07,813 --> 00:19:09,273
It must be broken.

264
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,402
Dong-hui, my thermostat is broken.

265
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,820
What's the superintendent's…

266
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:18,657
Never mind.

267
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,367
Everything's okay now.

268
00:19:20,450 --> 00:19:21,952
I'll give them a call. Bye.

269
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,248
Jeez.

270
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,710
What do I do?

271
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:33,839
Brother-in-Law.

272
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,340
Hi, Jae-woo.

273
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,595
It's so nice and toasty here.

274
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,971
Why are you here this late?

275
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,849
You do have excellent heating here,
don't you?

276
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,934
No, the heater's off.

277
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:50,397
Haeng-seon won't turn it on
unless it's under 20 degrees Celsius.

278
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,986
Then the house must have great insulation.

279
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:59,406
Stop beating around the bush
and explain what's happening.

280
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:01,325
It's really nothing serious.

281
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:03,160
I happen to be sensitive to cold,

282
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:05,162
and it gets chilly at night these days.

283
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,414
I went home
after talking to you on the phone,

284
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,708
and I felt like I was
coming down with a cold.

285
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,835
But the thermostat wouldn't turn on.

286
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,295
Why?

287
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,922
It's broken.

288
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,633
It won't be fixed until tomorrow,

289
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:19,593
but I kept shivering.

290
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:21,595
So I had to do something.

291
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,847
I can't afford to fall ill.

292
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,724
Your point is,

293
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,101
you came over
because your thermostat is broken?

294
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,729
That's exactly right.

295
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,483
And what's this?

296
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,444
I brought a change of clothes, underwear,

297
00:20:37,527 --> 00:20:40,155
a toothbrush, a razor,
supplements, and medicine.

298
00:20:41,031 --> 00:20:43,158
One would think he's moving in.
Right, Jae-woo?

299
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:46,995
Brother-in-Law.

300
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:50,540
Does this mean we'll sleep together
in my room tonight?

301
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:56,255
Yes. That would best fit

302
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:59,883
the norm of Korean society.

303
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,719
It's also in line with
traditional Confucian values.

304
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,557
I'll get you a blanket.

305
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,479
Why?

306
00:21:14,773 --> 00:21:15,774
Mr. Choi.

307
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:17,985
Hi, Hae-e.

308
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:19,945
You're still up.

309
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,699
My room's this way.

310
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:44,344
Give me just a second.

311
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,892
Yes!

312
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,438
Come on! Play fair, you bunch of cheaters.

313
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,898
You should do whatever it takes to win.

314
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:58,984
-Right, Hae-e?
-Sorry?

315
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,028
-Hae-e, look.
-What?

316
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,571
-It's your turn.
-Right.

317
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,949
Try this one. Number two.

318
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,868
Be careful.

319
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,620
-Yes!
-Oh, my!

320
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,705
What was that?

321
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:16,293
I have a little headache.
Can I go to my room?

322
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,962
Is it bad?
Are you having a migraine again?

323
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,922
-Want some medicine?
-No, that's fine.

324
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,799
Have fun. I'm turning in.

325
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,634
-Good night, Mr. Choi.
-Good night.

326
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,970
Is she okay?

327
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,139
Go ahead.

328
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,307
Is it my turn?

329
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:34,352
-Let's see here.
-It's not going to be easy.

330
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,812
It's too risky.

331
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,939
This won't be easy.

332
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,693
I could try this one.

333
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,320
Okay.

334
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,238
-Where? Which one?
-This one.

335
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,077
Gosh, you scared me.

336
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:55,082
Why would you blow in my ear?

337
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,666
What about playing fair?

338
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:59,086
Cripes, who cares?
I'll do whatever it takes to win.

339
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:02,672
Have some pride
as a former national athlete.

340
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,050
Jae-woo, help me stack these again.

341
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:07,427
You're mean, Haeng-seon!

342
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,345
You're ugly!

343
00:23:08,428 --> 00:23:10,555
-She's not ugly, Jae-woo.
-What?

344
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,269
NAM HAE-E

345
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:12,492
Hui-jae.

346
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,036
What do I do?

347
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,040
What should I do?

348
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:37,684
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

349
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:52,908
-Brother-in-Law.
-Yes?

350
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,451
You're awake.

351
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,456
I think I hurt someone.

352
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,334
You hurt someone?

353
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,797
Yes, so I apologized to them,

354
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,507
and they said it was fine.

355
00:25:11,218 --> 00:25:13,345
But I can't tell

356
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,806
whether they meant it or not.

357
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,517
And it is bothering me a lot.

358
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,314
So it's a woman.

359
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,650
Well, it's not a man.

360
00:25:26,733 --> 00:25:30,779
If it's bothering you,
you must have feelings for her.

361
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,824
If it bothers me,
does that mean I like her?

362
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,618
Probably.

363
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,037
Your sister was like that to me.

364
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:43,250
I was bothered, upset, and worried by her.

365
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:46,795
Do you get it now?

366
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,589
Then stop thinking about it and sleep.

367
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,758
You should go to sleep early.

368
00:25:51,841 --> 00:25:53,969
You have work tomorrow.

369
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,391
No, it's okay. Everything's okay.

370
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:05,105
-But--
-It's fine, Jae-woo. Go to sleep.

371
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,440
You're thinking too much.

372
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:09,985
It's okay. Let's sleep.

373
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,281
-But--
-Jae-woo.

374
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:17,158
You need to sleep now more than ever.

375
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,369
Let's sleep. It's okay.

376
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:36,386
-I'm not asleep.
-You're very sensitive.

377
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,888
I have too much on my mind
and can't sleep.

378
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,266
It's okay. That happens.

379
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,351
But you can still sleep.

380
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:46,021
You should sleep. It's okay.

381
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,731
Stop thinking.

382
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,191
You're too sensitive.

383
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:53,153
You can sleep.

384
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:55,155
You're tired.

385
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,098
What if the kids see you?

386
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:04,724
Shush. It's okay.

387
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,850
Is Jae-woo asleep?

388
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,811
He's fast asleep, so don't worry.

389
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,687
-This is still not okay.
-It's fine.

390
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,940
No, it's not.

391
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,900
-Seriously, what's with you?
-It's okay.

392
00:28:14,692 --> 00:28:16,152
Let's sleep. It's okay.

393
00:28:16,236 --> 00:28:18,905
-No, it's not.
-Don't worry.

394
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,825
-It's okay.
-What are you talking about?

395
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:24,327
-Wait.
-It's really fine.

396
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:26,871
Take this.

397
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,623
Let's sleep.

398
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:32,752
Let's sleep.

399
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,256
My goodness.

400
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,924
You're crazy.

401
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,177
You're out of here in five minutes.

402
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,345
Just five minutes.

403
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,056
-No more.
-No more.

404
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,527
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

405
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:06,703
Mr. Choi!

406
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:09,456
Mr. Choi.

407
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,626
-Okay.
-Wait.

408
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,230
Hae-e.

409
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:35,732
You're up early.

410
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,692
My eyes just opened.

411
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:40,445
-Go back to sleep. I'll make juice.
-No.

412
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:42,489
-I'll do it.
-It's okay. I'll do it.

413
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,491
I have nothing better to do.

414
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:47,035
Okay then.

415
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,229
-Go back to sleep.
-I will.

416
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,195
Brother-in-Law, where--

417
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:28,201
Listen to me carefully.

418
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,955
I was with you in this room all night.

419
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,498
But you weren't.

420
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,796
You weren't here
when I went to the bathroom at 4 a.m.,

421
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,548
-or when I woke up--
-Brother-in-Law.

422
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:45,093
Sometimes,

423
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:48,721
there are secrets that must stay
between two men.

424
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:57,063
A promise between one man and another.

425
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,941
Do you understand?

426
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,738
"One man and another."

427
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,711
Hae-e.

428
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:22,297
-Off to school?
-Yes.

429
00:31:24,966 --> 00:31:26,342
I heard from your mom.

430
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,387
You can't ace every test.

431
00:31:30,263 --> 00:31:32,307
Don't let the past exam mess with you.

432
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:34,225
Shoulders back.

433
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,229
Mr. Choi.

434
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:41,566
Well…

435
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,820
Do you have time this evening?

436
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,407
My schedule is pretty full today.

437
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,534
What is it?
Do you have something to tell me?

438
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,204
Never mind. Some other time then.

439
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,770
HIGHLY LIKELY TO BE A KILLER QUESTION…

440
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,441
MR. CHOI

441
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:28,529
-Hi, Mr. Choi. I'm already--
-Sorry, Dong-hui.

442
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,157
I should've called you sooner.

443
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,617
I'm at Haeng-seon's right now.

444
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,328
I'll drive myself.
You're still home, right?

445
00:32:36,663 --> 00:32:37,664
Yes.

446
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,083
Then I'll meet you at the venue.

447
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,000
Okay.

448
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:43,503
You know those pictures
and videos we took in Incheon?

449
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,546
Can you send them over?

450
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:46,798
It slipped my mind.

451
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,841
I'll send them now.

452
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,718
-Thanks.
-Bye.

453
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,165
Where's Jae-woo?

454
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,583
He's out on a walk.

455
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:25,169
Same time every day.
He takes his routine seriously.

456
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,255
He's just like Kant.

457
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,465
Kant took his walks
at the same time every day.

458
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:34,470
That's how the people
in Königsberg set their clocks.

459
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,266
-Kant…
-Yes.

460
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,434
Did you call Mr. Ji?

461
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,602
Yes, I told him I'd drive myself.

462
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:44,063
-Here they are.
-What is it?

463
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,315
The pictures and videos from the yacht.

464
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,567
Look at the camera.

465
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,070
We look great.

466
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,488
It's actually a video.

467
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,115
The colors look insane.

468
00:33:54,907 --> 00:33:56,576
The models did a great job too.

469
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:59,454
Plus, the weather was wonderful…

470
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,873
that day.

471
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:03,958
I'm truly sorry.

472
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,544
I should've been more careful,

473
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,171
but the waves suddenly hit.

474
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,505
This is great!

475
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:11,674
It looks amazing.

476
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,635
No, I'll take it for you.

477
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,667
Okay. Is everyone here?

478
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,128
I have no special announcements to make,

479
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:52,799
but your midterms
have been unofficially graded.

480
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:56,677
I think one of our classmates
will be in first place again.

481
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,642
Lee Sun-jae.

482
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,394
You must've worked really hard.

483
00:35:05,478 --> 00:35:07,897
You did well in Reading, your weakness.

484
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:17,824
You should all study hard
until the finals.

485
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,368
And pay attention in class today.

486
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,496
By the way, Hae-e,

487
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:26,040
come to the teachers' office.

488
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,875
Dismissed.

489
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:53,693
READING SECTION

490
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,321
What happened?

491
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:02,493
Sure, the Reading section was difficult,

492
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,995
but it's been your forte.

493
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,039
You get nearly all questions right
in mock exams too.

494
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,378
Were you feeling unwell?

495
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:14,547
-Or--
-I miscalculated…

496
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,010
I miscalculated the time.

497
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,056
I should've set aside time
to mark my answers,

498
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,018
but I failed to.

499
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:33,482
It's not like you to make such a mistake.

500
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:36,903
I'm sorry.

501
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:26,535
Su-a.

502
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,540
Do you have something to say to me?

503
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:50,893
Your call cannot…

504
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:54,146
Why won't Mi-ok pick up?

505
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,024
I have news on Sun-jae's brother.

506
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:03,739
SU-A'S MOM

507
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:05,866
Why does she keep calling me? So annoying.

508
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:06,951
It's Su-a's mom.

509
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:10,162
She calls me all the time,

510
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,957
asks me what I'm doing,
and tells me to come and go.

511
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,209
I know. She can be a bit pushy.

512
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,128
She gossips too much too.

513
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,462
She makes me uncomfortable.

514
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,672
Right?

515
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:21,257
She's such a mean person.

516
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:25,011
She doesn't understand
that what goes around comes around.

517
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,804
Who doesn't?

518
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,266
Su-hui! You scared the life out of me!

519
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,686
Who were you talking about
so enthusiastically?

520
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,604
-You didn't even notice me?
-Su-hui.

521
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,440
Why weren't you picking up?

522
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,399
What?

523
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:40,151
-You called me?
-Yes.

524
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:43,946
My phone was on silent.

525
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:45,323
I totally forgot.

526
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:46,532
I see.

527
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:51,912
We ran into each other just outside
and decided to grab a coffee.

528
00:38:51,996 --> 00:38:54,040
I needed a little caffeine.

529
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,000
You love coffee, don't you?

530
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:58,878
Why didn't you invite me?
I love coffee too.

531
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:00,796
Right.

532
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,216
I heard they let him go home.

533
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,720
But who knows if he really is innocent
or if his mom pulled some strings.

534
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,515
If he'd been guilty,
he wouldn't have walked free.

535
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,143
Oh, boy.

536
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:17,730
My goodness.

537
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:19,565
-What is it?
-What happened?

538
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:22,193
Dan-ji just texted me saying…

539
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,031
Sun-jae got first place in the midterms.

540
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:27,948
Goodness.

541
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:32,119
Sun-jae's always been in the top five,
but he's never gotten first place.

542
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,456
When his family is going through
a rough patch at that.

543
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,708
He's one strong-willed boy.

544
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,127
He must take after his mom
to be so unsympathetic.

545
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:44,840
By the way, didn't you say
your phone was on silent?

546
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:47,468
That's not the point.

547
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:48,886
Hold on a second.

548
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,765
I thought Sun-jae always struggled
with Reading.

549
00:39:54,433 --> 00:39:56,394
Has he been getting tutored?

550
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,980
I'll call his mom and ask right away.

551
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,459
Hello, Ms. Lee.

552
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:22,753
What's going on?

553
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:26,215
He did?

554
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,342
Not yet.

555
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,263
A secret method?

556
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,350
He did seem to spend more time
studying that subject.

557
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,812
No, he hasn't been tutored.
He doesn't have time.

558
00:40:39,895 --> 00:40:41,188
I've been busy lately too.

559
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,985
Okay. Let's meet for coffee soon.

560
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,415
Snap out of it and look at the results.

561
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,792
All's well that ends well.

562
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,544
The door is opening.

563
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,922
That's right.

564
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:11,385
He's been paying for the treatment
and surgery costs for the injured cats

565
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,845
out of his own pocket.

566
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:17,433
Recently, he even went so far
as to arrange a funeral for a dead cat.

567
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,519
But why do you ask?

568
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,981
There were a few things
we needed to check.

569
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,109
Thank you, ma'am.

570
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,986
What is it?

571
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,696
Really?

572
00:41:30,779 --> 00:41:32,031
Okay, we'll be right there.

573
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,951
I did hear about star teachers
manipulating public opinion online,

574
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:38,662
but Jin I-sang went above and beyond.

575
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:42,583
He logged into Skymom.net
and Studyhard.com as Chiyeolsucks

576
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:45,085
no less than 2,100 times
over the past 4 years.

577
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:48,130
He wrote and deleted 138 malicious posts.

578
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:50,174
He sent 372 messages

579
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,677
to top university students offering money
to leave hate comments.

580
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:58,474
It seems like he spent all his time
trying to bring Choi Chi-yeol down.

581
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:01,519
How could he do this for four years
without getting caught?

582
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:04,897
He always used proxies and VPNs

583
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,441
to change his IP address
to another country.

584
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,862
Those crooks and their clever tricks.

585
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:15,324
I'll meet with the last person
Jin I-sang talked to on the phone.

586
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:19,119
This is some solid evidence.
It's basically undeniable.

587
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:21,664
Okay.

588
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,676
Hi, it's me.

589
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,011
I need you to do
a background check on someone.

590
00:42:37,179 --> 00:42:38,931
The name's Jeong Seong-hyeon.

591
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,141
The ID number is…

592
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,104
That's right.

593
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,691
It's the boy from the murder case
of a middle schooler's mom.

594
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:52,403
Goodness.

595
00:42:55,990 --> 00:42:58,450
Making money while seeing your boyfriend.

596
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,535
What a multitasker.

597
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,750
Deliver to the church first.

598
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:09,545
Don't get overexcited
and go straight to Mr. Choi.

599
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:10,796
Of course not.

600
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,757
I don't just work here. I own this place.

601
00:43:13,841 --> 00:43:17,011
Fine, but you're in love, boss!

602
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,013
You seem a little distracted these days.

603
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:20,848
He's recording classes all day.

604
00:43:20,931 --> 00:43:23,058
I just made a bit extra while I was at it.

605
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,019
I get it. Whatever you say.

606
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,729
Ride safe anyway.

607
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:27,813
Got it.

608
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,110
Off you go with love!

609
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,030
The expression on the left

610
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:39,241
indicates the slope
between the origin and a,

611
00:43:39,325 --> 00:43:41,243
and the expression on the right

612
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,580
is the slope between the origin and b.

613
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:48,626
So the value on the right
is less than the value on the left.

614
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,170
Therefore, the first option is true.

615
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,921
Let's move on to the second option.

616
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,509
MS. NAM HAENG-SEON

617
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:01,180
-Mr. Ji.
-Hi. What brings you here?

618
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:02,640
I was on a delivery nearby.

619
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:06,602
Eat this with your team
when you're hungry.

620
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,521
You didn't have to. They'll love it.

621
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,025
Mr. Choi just started recording.
Too bad you missed him.

622
00:44:13,108 --> 00:44:14,693
No problem.

623
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,237
-Don't tell him that I was here.
-Okay.

624
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,781
-Bye.
-Thank you.

625
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:31,043
The wet wipes!

626
00:44:40,886 --> 00:44:42,471
What are you doing?

627
00:44:47,643 --> 00:44:49,186
I've had my doubts, but…

628
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:52,439
Is this your true nature?

629
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,316
Or are you only doing this to me?

630
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,068
Why…

631
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,323
Was it intentional that day too?

632
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,743
I didn't see any waves in the video.

633
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,748
The weather was indeed
lovely that day, wasn't it?

634
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,000
What are you trying to say?

635
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,255
So…

636
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:22,344
are you accusing me
of putting you in danger on purpose?

637
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,762
Yes, I saw it.

638
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,265
You turned the yacht on purpose.

639
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:30,436
I told myself that I must have been
mistaken and was being sensitive,

640
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,646
but I just realized.

641
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:35,190
I wasn't mistaken.

642
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,692
It was completely intentional.

643
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,860
What did you say?

644
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,124
There must've been a misunderstanding.

645
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,460
There's no reason why he'd do such…

646
00:45:55,627 --> 00:45:56,712
I know.

647
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,840
You can't believe it.

648
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:01,592
I know you don't want to.

649
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:03,260
But Mr. Choi.

650
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,679
My vision is better than average.

651
00:46:05,762 --> 00:46:07,306
My eyes haven't started aging yet.

652
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,976
Fine, I may be mistaken about the yacht.

653
00:46:11,560 --> 00:46:13,854
But not about today.
I caught him red-handed.

654
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,442
I won't ask you to side with me.

655
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,403
I know Mr. Ji means a lot to you.

656
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:22,321
However,

657
00:46:23,739 --> 00:46:25,115
I am confused.

658
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,035
I need some time to think.

659
00:46:29,912 --> 00:46:32,372
Okay. I'll call you after work.

660
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,624
No.

661
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,252
I'll call you when my mind becomes clear.

662
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:04,112
It's absurd, Mr. Choi.
Why would I intentionally…

663
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:09,201
She could've gotten badly hurt.
Her life could've been in danger.

664
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,495
I didn't do it. She's framing me.

665
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,871
About today…

666
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:15,749
Fine, I was being petty.

667
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:17,918
We had already eaten,

668
00:47:18,001 --> 00:47:20,754
and we're all on edge
when we're recording.

669
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,881
She meant well,
but she was being a nuisance.

670
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,968
Who is she to show up unannounced
and drop those sandwiches on us?

671
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:27,844
It was too much, and I was annoyed.

672
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:32,683
I apologize.

673
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,311
But the yacht thing isn't true.

674
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,479
Fine.

675
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:40,148
I get it, but you…

676
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,362
Let's finish recording first.

677
00:48:17,227 --> 00:48:18,562
Meet me at the playground.

678
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,522
I'm not leaving until you come.

679
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:40,167
-Sun-jae.
-Don't come over.

680
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:42,085
I'm not coming.

681
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,462
Sun-jae,

682
00:48:43,545 --> 00:48:44,921
we need to talk in person.

683
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:47,049
You can't avoid this forever.

684
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:51,553
The exam was exactly the same
as the material you gave me.

685
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:53,347
-It's--
-So what?

686
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:55,807
My mom has a knack
for acquiring past exams.

687
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,393
It could be a coincidence.

688
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:00,687
Do you really think so?

689
00:49:02,939 --> 00:49:04,107
I know you don't.

690
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,692
What are you trying to say?

691
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:07,736
Should I report my mom?

692
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,488
Is that what you want?

693
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,575
Jeez.

694
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:41,144
Don't tell me you…

695
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:44,064
I told you it was just for you.

696
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:49,277
I told you numerous times
not to show it to anyone else!

697
00:49:50,445 --> 00:49:51,279
So?

698
00:49:52,114 --> 00:49:53,115
Are you saying

699
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,076
this is all my fault?

700
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,497
Get out. Get out right now!

701
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,666
Sun-jae, hear me out.

702
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:28,734
Hello, is this Hae-e?

703
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,903
It's Sun-jae's mom.

704
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:36,343
So what's your plan?

705
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,223
Why did you want to see Sun-jae?

706
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,267
It seemed like
you were asking him to meet up.

707
00:51:47,145 --> 00:51:50,690
I was going to persuade him
to tell our homeroom teacher.

708
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,700
Then you'll face discipline too.

709
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,286
You'll get a zero,
and your grades will take a nosedive.

710
00:52:04,621 --> 00:52:06,957
I already submitted my exam blank.

711
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,842
This isn't right, Ms. Jang.

712
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,220
-It's not too late to make it right--
-No.

713
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,847
Then I wouldn't have even started.

714
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:29,062
It is what it is.

715
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:34,276
If you truly are Sun-jae's friend
and care about his future,

716
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:37,237
please look the other way.

717
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,365
How could I do that
when I've found out everything?

718
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:41,908
Sun-jae is torn apart--

719
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,577
My son's fine.

720
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,912
Everything will be okay
as long as you keep quiet.

721
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,541
Many people's lives
could be ruined because of you.

722
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,211
Will you be able to handle that?

723
00:52:53,295 --> 00:52:55,881
I risked my career and life for Sun-jae.

724
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,550
It wasn't for him.

725
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:01,011
It was for yourself.

726
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:07,267
Sun-jae isn't fine.

727
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,896
And I'll do what I think is right.

728
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,194
Do you really have to?

729
00:53:19,571 --> 00:53:20,697
I'm sorry.

730
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:32,060
No.

731
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,730
I'll call you when my mind becomes clear.

732
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:42,445
FAVORITES
NAM HAENG-SEON NOT HO NAM-SEON

733
00:54:56,835 --> 00:55:02,048
So many customers
asked for braised pollock today.

734
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,050
When we have pollock,
they want anglerfish.

735
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:06,261
And vice versa.

736
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:09,639
It's odd, isn't it, boss?

737
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,641
I guess.

738
00:55:13,393 --> 00:55:15,770
Anyway, our sales have fully recovered.

739
00:55:17,355 --> 00:55:18,440
Yes.

740
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:22,318
Hey.

741
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:28,074
Nation's Best Banchan
hasn't had a get-together in a while.

742
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,159
Should we all go…

743
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:30,994
What do you say?

744
00:55:31,077 --> 00:55:32,454
How does that sound, Jae-woo?

745
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:34,289
I don't want to drink.

746
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:37,917
Then you can just eat food.

747
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:41,087
Forget it. I have to go to the market
early in the morning.

748
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,173
Go home. I'll finish up.

749
00:55:43,256 --> 00:55:45,592
I can stay and help.

750
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:48,553
Just go home. I feel bad that
I've been away a lot lately.

751
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:53,141
If you say so, boss.

752
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:56,936
Jae-woo, you can go upstairs too.
I'll finish up.

753
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,731
No, I want to go home with you
after cleaning this.

754
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:03,735
Let's go.

755
00:56:03,818 --> 00:56:05,570
-Why?
-Let's just go.

756
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:07,530
See you tomorrow. Good night, boss.

757
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,574
-Good work today.
-Why?

758
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,117
Come on. Let's go.

759
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:37,769
This just gets better and better.

760
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:38,853
Hae…

761
00:56:45,819 --> 00:56:48,404
-Hi, Mom.
-Are you home, Hae-e?

762
00:56:48,488 --> 00:56:50,615
No, I'm out.

763
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:52,784
I was with Dan-ji,
and I'm heading home now.

764
00:56:52,867 --> 00:56:53,868
At this hour?

765
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:58,414
Anyway, can you get
a large trash bag on the way?

766
00:56:58,498 --> 00:56:59,374
A trash bag?

767
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,709
Yes, one just burst. It's a mess.

768
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,962
Hurry up. You have money, right?

769
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,755
Got it.

770
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:07,507
The largest one, right?

771
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:09,759
-Yes. Hurry up.
-Okay.

772
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,204
Why isn't she…

773
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:52,177
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be redirected

774
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,803
-What happened?
-to voicemail after the beep…

775
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:55,180
Why won't she pick up?

776
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,852
I can't wait forever.
I'll go get one myself.

777
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,319
I waited outside the academy for hours.

778
00:58:10,278 --> 00:58:12,447
They said you'd left,
but you wouldn't pick up.

779
00:58:13,031 --> 00:58:15,325
I almost filed a police report.

780
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:17,744
Why are you soaked in sweat?

781
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:21,289
What did you do?
Did you walk home from the academy?

782
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:23,374
Why would you do that?

783
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:27,212
There's no time to lose!
You have an online chemistry class too!

784
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,798
What should I do with you?
Have you gone crazy?

785
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,468
Yes.

786
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,678
I must've gone crazy.

787
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,348
What?

788
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,769
I'm out of my mind. Or maybe…

789
00:58:44,604 --> 00:58:46,231
I'm turning into a monster.

790
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:55,532
What are you talking about?

791
00:58:57,492 --> 00:58:59,869
You're turning into a monster?
What monster?

792
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,539
What's with you?

793
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:06,084
Why are you crying? What is it?

794
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,086
Tell me so I can understand.

795
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,257
Get it together, Su-a.
Tell me why you're crying.

796
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,053
Stop crying. Get it together.

797
00:59:17,136 --> 00:59:19,931
Why are you crying? What's with you?

798
00:59:42,287 --> 00:59:43,788
Oh, no.

799
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,333
Haeng-seon.

800
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:49,961
It's not that scary.

801
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:51,504
Hold on.

802
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,464
Hold on a minute.

803
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:55,842
Good grief.

804
00:59:59,846 --> 01:00:01,848
Why isn't she home yet?

805
01:00:09,230 --> 01:00:13,067
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be redirected to voicemail…

806
01:00:13,151 --> 01:00:14,569
Did her phone die?

807
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,582
Hi, Dan-ji.

808
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,834
I'm sorry to call so late.
It's Hae-e's mom.

809
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:31,628
Did Hae-e go back to you?

810
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,464
Sorry?

811
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,674
I haven't seen her
since we were at school.

812
01:00:37,717 --> 01:00:40,261
You didn't see her earlier this evening?

813
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:43,014
She called me around 10 p.m.
saying she'd met with you.

814
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,516
No, I didn't.

815
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:47,727
She's not home yet?

816
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,896
No.

817
01:00:49,979 --> 01:00:51,147
I wonder what happened.

818
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,068
Let me try calling Sun-jae.
I'll call you back.

819
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:56,778
Okay. Thanks.

820
01:01:01,949 --> 01:01:03,326
Hae-e didn't meet Dan-ji.

821
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,329
Where could she be, Jae-woo?

822
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:10,917
Hae-e?

823
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:13,878
No, I didn't meet her. Why?

824
01:01:13,961 --> 01:01:17,965
Hae-e told her mom she'd been with me,
but she hasn't come home yet.

825
01:01:19,133 --> 01:01:21,511
So you didn't see her
or talk to her on the phone?

826
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,137
No.

827
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,306
Okay, I'll call you back.

828
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:28,017
Call me if you hear from her.

829
01:01:28,101 --> 01:01:30,228
Call her mom first

830
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:31,979
and then call me, okay?

831
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,107
Okay.

832
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:45,827
NAM HAE-E

833
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,246
Your call cannot be completed.

834
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:51,624
You will be redirected
to voicemail after the beep…

835
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:56,421
NAM HAE-E

836
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:09,350
WHERE ARE YOU, HAE-E?
WHAT HAPPENED?

837
01:02:16,733 --> 01:02:17,608
Yeong-ju.

838
01:02:18,651 --> 01:02:20,403
Your call cannot be completed…

839
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:23,114
No luck at the internet cafe.
What about the karaoke rooms?

840
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:24,073
She wasn't there.

841
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,908
What on earth is going on?

842
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:29,328
Maybe something happened at school.

843
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:31,372
I don't know.

844
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:32,957
I'm sorry I woke you up.

845
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,709
That's not the issue here.

846
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,129
Where in the world did she go?

847
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:39,464
It's way past midnight.

848
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:42,759
Jae-woo will call you
if Hae-e comes home, right?

849
01:02:52,518 --> 01:02:53,352
Hey!

850
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:56,355
-Have you found Hae-e?
-Not yet.

851
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,817
I called him.
We need all the help we can get.

852
01:03:01,486 --> 01:03:02,528
Are you okay?

853
01:03:03,905 --> 01:03:05,865
Don't worry. We can find her.

854
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,075
Let's report to the precinct first.

855
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:10,244
We can report her missing
since she's a minor.

856
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,246
Let's track her phone.

857
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:14,582
-Let's go.
-Okay.

858
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,504
I understand your concern,

859
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:22,548
but there are procedures to follow
to track a phone.

860
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:24,717
We'll try to hurry.

861
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:27,512
It's possible that she just ran away.

862
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,349
It'd be a relief if she simply ran away,

863
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:33,267
but we don't know that.

864
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,519
Goodness!

865
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:38,272
Can't they skip the formalities
during an emergency?

866
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:40,525
What if something bad happens? No.

867
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:44,278
That's unlikely, but you never know.

868
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,657
They told us to wait at home.

869
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:49,826
So go home. Your mom must be worried.

870
01:03:49,909 --> 01:03:52,370
Don't worry. I can call her.

871
01:03:52,453 --> 01:03:53,955
I'll stay. You can go home.

872
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,414
I'll call when we find Hae-e.

873
01:04:11,138 --> 01:04:12,598
Don't worry too much.

874
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:16,686
This often happens
to students getting ready for college.

875
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:21,524
Even Hae-e could be stressed out
about college admissions.

876
01:04:24,485 --> 01:04:27,363
Get some sleep.
I'll wake you up if someone calls.

877
01:04:27,446 --> 01:04:30,074
You should sleep too. You have work later.

878
01:04:30,157 --> 01:04:33,119
I'm fine.
I'm used to staying up all night.

879
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:37,039
Hello?

880
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:39,333
Hello, ma'am.
I'm calling from the precinct.

881
01:04:39,417 --> 01:04:40,626
Okay.

882
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:44,380
Your daughter's phone is off,
so it can't be tracked.

883
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:46,632
Since the phone was last used
near your house,

884
01:04:46,716 --> 01:04:49,468
we'll start by searching the neighborhood.

885
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:53,681
Also, she talked to another person
before she talked to you.

886
01:04:53,764 --> 01:04:54,682
Okay.

887
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:58,436
The number is 010-0869-5999.

888
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,521
Do you know this number?

889
01:05:00,605 --> 01:05:02,315
Was that 0869-5999?

890
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:03,816
One second, please.

891
01:05:08,988 --> 01:05:11,157
SUN-JAE'S MOM

892
01:05:24,378 --> 01:05:26,213
WHERE ARE YOU, HAE-E?
WHAT HAPPENED?

893
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,221
What are you doing?
You'll be late for school.

894
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,641
I'll give you a ride. Come out.

895
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:51,238
Hello, Ms. Nam.

896
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:53,741
Hi, I'm sorry to call you so early.

897
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:57,286
By any chance, did you talk to Hae-e
on the phone last night?

898
01:05:58,162 --> 01:06:01,165
-What?
-Sun-jae didn't tell you?

899
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:05,336
Hae-e didn't come home last night.

900
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:07,630
The police checked her call history,

901
01:06:07,713 --> 01:06:10,299
and you were the last person
she talked to on the phone.

902
01:06:13,886 --> 01:06:15,680
Yes, I talked to her last night.

903
01:06:16,847 --> 01:06:20,351
I was wondering if Sun-jae was with her,
but he wasn't.

904
01:06:21,310 --> 01:06:23,104
He came straight home from the academy.

905
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:26,440
I'm sorry. You must be so worried.

906
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,734
I see.

907
01:06:29,443 --> 01:06:30,778
All right.

908
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:31,862
Okay.

909
01:06:32,989 --> 01:06:35,533
I'm sure she'll come home soon.
Don't worry too much.

910
01:06:36,117 --> 01:06:37,076
Okay.

911
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:38,995
Bye.

912
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:45,418
Mom.

913
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,628
You talked to Hae-e last night?

914
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:51,507
Why?

915
01:06:52,758 --> 01:06:54,176
What did you two talk about?

916
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:55,594
None of your business.

917
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:58,597
She's missing. I can't reach her!

918
01:07:00,766 --> 01:07:01,642
Mom.

919
01:07:02,601 --> 01:07:04,103
Why did you lie to her mom?

920
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:06,772
What did you say to Hae-e?

921
01:07:11,736 --> 01:07:13,029
Did you…

922
01:07:14,989 --> 01:07:15,906
meet her last night?

923
01:07:18,367 --> 01:07:20,036
You came home late last night.

924
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,038
Mom.

925
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:23,998
Where were you?

926
01:07:28,002 --> 01:07:29,045
Yes.

927
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:31,297
I met her.

928
01:07:32,298 --> 01:07:34,884
I told her to keep quiet, but she refused.

929
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,510
And?

930
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,513
And what did you do?

931
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,141
What do you think I did?

932
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,894
What do you take me for?

933
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,234
I'm late for work.

934
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,111
Go to school or whatever.

935
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:15,216
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be redirected to voicemail…

936
01:08:19,011 --> 01:08:20,137
This is driving me nuts.

937
01:08:21,847 --> 01:08:23,808
Where in the world did she go?

938
01:08:23,891 --> 01:08:25,684
I'm freaking out, Geon-hu.

939
01:08:27,019 --> 01:08:28,979
I just talked to my mom,

940
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:33,234
and the police began a search
assuming she went missing.

941
01:08:34,401 --> 01:08:35,820
My mom checked with them.

942
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:42,785
What about Sun-jae?

943
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,162
She hasn't called him either?

944
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,998
No, she hasn't.

945
01:08:50,584 --> 01:08:53,087
I can't believe Nam Hae-e is missing.

946
01:08:55,047 --> 01:08:57,424
Hey, she'll be fine, right?

947
01:08:58,759 --> 01:09:00,719
Nothing bad will happen, right?

948
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,389
Let's hope so.

949
01:09:22,366 --> 01:09:24,910
No.

950
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:26,829
No!

951
01:09:30,875 --> 01:09:33,586
These are just some questions
we're required to ask.

952
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:37,798
Did anything unusual happen
before she left the house?

953
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:41,302
-Did she fight with her family?
-Not at all.

954
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:45,014
Was she bullied at school?

955
01:09:45,097 --> 01:09:47,850
No, none of that happened.

956
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:53,272
Hey, Jong-ryeol.

957
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:54,857
You're here.

958
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:56,275
Hello, Mr. Jeon.

959
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:58,319
This is my kid's homeroom teacher.

960
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,528
Hello.

961
01:10:01,030 --> 01:10:02,531
I was going to call and tell you,

962
01:10:03,115 --> 01:10:05,910
but I thought Hae-e's mother should know.

963
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:10,664
The thing is,

964
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:16,003
Hae-e submitted a blank Reading midterm.

965
01:10:16,587 --> 01:10:17,630
"Blank"?

966
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,634
She told me she had run out of time,

967
01:10:22,468 --> 01:10:25,429
but I thought it was odd for her
to make such a mistake.

968
01:10:26,680 --> 01:10:28,474
Then this happened.

969
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:32,728
-I thought you should know.
-I see.

970
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:41,987
Why?

971
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,864
Why did she submit her exam blank?

972
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,825
I don't know.

973
01:10:47,409 --> 01:10:48,244
Your call cannot…

974
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:51,080
She had studied so hard
to maintain good grades.

975
01:10:51,163 --> 01:10:52,623
Plus, Reading…

976
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,377
has been her strongest subject. So why?

977
01:10:56,460 --> 01:10:59,213
Could that be related
to her going missing?

978
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:02,883
-It seems most likely for now.
-Your call cannot be completed…

979
01:11:02,967 --> 01:11:05,219
She must've been tormented
for failing her exam.

980
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,971
-Your call cannot be completed…
-No.

981
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:09,682
I don't think that's it.

982
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:14,561
She wouldn't run away from home
because she messed up an exam.

983
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,232
It's not like her at all.

984
01:11:18,315 --> 01:11:19,858
Hae-e's phone is ringing.

985
01:11:19,942 --> 01:11:21,193
Give it to me.

986
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:27,116
Your call cannot be completed…

987
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:30,536
Your call cannot…

988
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,289
Oh, no. It got cut off again.

989
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,499
But the phone had just turned on.

990
01:11:35,582 --> 01:11:37,042
Try calling again.

991
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:38,168
Let me try.

992
01:11:42,548 --> 01:11:46,051
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be redirected to voicemail…

993
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:47,177
It's off again.

994
01:11:50,389 --> 01:11:52,099
Where could Hae-e be?

995
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:28,302
-Oh, no!
-Call an ambulance.

996
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:29,845
Someone call an ambulance!

997
01:12:29,928 --> 01:12:31,305
-My gosh.
-Hurry up!

998
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:32,556
-Is she dead?
-She got run over?

999
01:12:32,639 --> 01:12:33,891
What do we do?

1000
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,519
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1001
01:13:18,602 --> 01:13:19,895
Let's stay strong.

1002
01:13:19,978 --> 01:13:22,564
We need to protect Haeng-seon and Hae-e.

1003
01:13:22,648 --> 01:13:25,609
She's too impatient
to be lying down for too long.

1004
01:13:25,692 --> 01:13:27,528
She'll wake up soon.

1005
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:29,446
We're almost there.

1006
01:13:29,530 --> 01:13:32,032
In six months,
you can get into your dream university.

1007
01:13:32,116 --> 01:13:34,660
I really don't think
she attempted suicide.

1008
01:13:34,743 --> 01:13:35,828
What are you doing?

1009
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,246
Are you suspecting me?

1010
01:13:37,329 --> 01:13:39,873
After what I've done for you!

1011
01:13:39,957 --> 01:13:41,542
But I don't know anymore…

1012
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:43,502
about what kind of person he is

1013
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:46,088
or why he's by my side.

1014
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:53,095
