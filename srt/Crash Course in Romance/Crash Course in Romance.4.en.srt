1
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,497
This is driving me crazy.

3
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,835
That was the most physical affection
I've had in ages.

4
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:32,217
She's going to be mortified
once she sobers up.

5
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:35,637
This is hilarious.

6
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,640
It's just too hilarious.

7
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,330
Mr. Choi!

8
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,876
Mr. Choi!

9
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,504
Mr. Choi Chi-yeol!

10
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:15,677
Thank you so much! You know I…

11
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,305
Hold on!

12
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:33,319
REVOLT OF THE ARITHMETIC SEQUENCE

13
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,448
Yes. It hurts, doesn't it?

14
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,242
Isn't your head throbbing?

15
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,538
Don't you wish you could
smash your head in with a hammer?

16
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:47,250
You should've stopped drinking
when you were feeling tipsy.

17
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,335
You went way overboard last night.

18
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,171
Do you think you're still young?

19
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,465
You're no longer the super rookie you were
in your twenties.

20
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:58,469
I'm aware of that, so cut it out.
I'm regretting it.

21
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,848
So about yesterday.
Do you remember everything?

22
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,852
I wish I didn't.

23
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:06,895
I see.

24
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,522
Yesterday at around 10:30 p.m.,

25
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,025
you were going home drunk.

26
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,318
Then from afar…

27
00:03:14,485 --> 00:03:17,447
you saw Mr. Choi,
the star teacher, approaching.

28
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,241
So you let out a shriek out of the blue

29
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:21,743
and then ran toward him.

30
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,078
Then you lifted him up and--

31
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:24,996
That's enough!

32
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:29,667
I'm suffering both physically
and psychologically.

33
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,421
Jeez. Hey, even I was embarrassed!

34
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,591
You should've seen his bewildered face.

35
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,800
What should I do?

36
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,928
Should I not come to work for a few days?

37
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,680
-Or should I stay in the kitchen?
-Yes.

38
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:45,016
I'm too embarrassed to see him--

39
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,687
Hello, Mr. Choi. You're here early today.

40
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:51,689
I am.

41
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,027
I guess Ms. Nam isn't here yet.

42
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,071
Yes, well…

43
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,413
Hello, Ms. Cho.

44
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,874
Why are you calling?

45
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:13,086
The moms are gathering
for the All Care Program?

46
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:15,922
Of course, I'll be there.

47
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:17,840
I'll see you then. Goodbye.

48
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:22,512
Hello, Mr. Choi.

49
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:25,390
So tell me.

50
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,642
Are you feeling all right today?

51
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,559
All right?

52
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,687
Of course, I feel fine.

53
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:33,815
Why? Did something happen yesterday?

54
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:35,900
Did it, Yeong-ju?

55
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,155
It's nothing.
Never mind if you don't remember.

56
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,493
You know I really like you, right?

57
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:46,828
Sorry?

58
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,954
Sorry?

59
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,588
I was talking to the braised burdock.

60
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,216
It's one of my favorite side dishes.

61
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,135
I see. The braised burdock.

62
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,178
I see.

63
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,021
That was hilarious.

64
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:15,898
Why is she so hilarious?

65
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,820
I laughed so much that my stomach hurts.

66
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,326
Yes, Mr. Ji.

67
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,368
Mr. Choi,

68
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,203
Director Kang would like to see you.

69
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,872
I think it's about the schedule.

70
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:32,749
Jeez.

71
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,422
The answer is 12 over 5.

72
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:42,300
Did you guys all get that?

73
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,301
I hope you did.

74
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,805
Okay, that's it for today.
When are we meeting again?

75
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,098
Next week.

76
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,524
What is it, Mr. Yang?

77
00:06:00,318 --> 00:06:01,152
What?

78
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:05,114
Damn it, is he serious?

79
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,074
I'm hanging up.

80
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,744
Why are you doing this to me?

81
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:11,704
I can't take Choi Chi-yeol's spot.

82
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:13,414
Then what about the students?

83
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,000
Everyone knows
he's competing with Perfect M.

84
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,461
Do you want me to lose all the students?

85
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,881
What choice do I have?
Someone needs to take his spot.

86
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,050
But why me of all people?

87
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,135
You're basically asking me to fail!

88
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,179
Damn it.

89
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,598
Thank you.

90
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:42,944
-It's nice to meet you all.
-It's nice to meet you all.

91
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:46,572
I can't drink
because I need to pick up Su-a later.

92
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,698
Okay.

93
00:06:53,204 --> 00:06:56,958
I know this gathering was quite sudden,
so thank you all for coming.

94
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,253
Time is precious
when it comes to admissions.

95
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,841
And I thought it'd be smart
to quickly figure out what to do

96
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:06,467
for our and our kids' sakes.

97
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,511
We're just grateful for this gathering.

98
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,346
I wanted us to meet up and talk.

99
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:11,889
By the way,

100
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,685
I didn't want to come here empty-handed,
so I brought some side dishes.

101
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,602
Goodness.

102
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,520
Hold on.

103
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,149
Would it be weird to have them with beer?

104
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,609
-Come on.
-Not at all.

105
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,736
Goodness, they look so delectable.

106
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,906
I'm on a diet, but I'm going
to gain weight thanks to you.

107
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,117
Jeez, you're already skinny,
to begin with.

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,828
Wear elastic waist pants next time,
and I'll fatten you up.

109
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,872
Really? Fine, I'll do that.

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,750
Seems Ms. Jang is late once again.

111
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,878
She makes it obvious
that she's a working mom.

112
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:45,006
If she'd told us she couldn't make it,
we would've rescheduled.

113
00:07:45,089 --> 00:07:46,466
-Right?
-Right.

114
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,677
That must be her. I'll get the door.

115
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,887
Okay, thanks.

116
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,890
Ms. Nam is fun to be around.

117
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,766
I agree. She's pleasant

118
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:57,268
-and easygoing.
-Hello.

119
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,729
She has to be like that
to run her business.

120
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,814
-Hello. Ms. Jang is here.
-Hello.

121
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,108
-Hello.
-Hello.

122
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:06,360
-Hello, Ms. Jang.
-Hello.

123
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,196
I'm sorry for being late.

124
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:10,114
We're already done with scheduling.

125
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:13,493
You came just in time for the after-party.
The boring part is over.

126
00:08:13,576 --> 00:08:15,995
Is that so? What a bummer.

127
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,039
Would you like some beer?

128
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,584
Or do you only drink beverages
like wine, Ms. Jang?

129
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:22,793
No, beer is fine.

130
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:23,878
Let me.

131
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:25,630
It's fine. I can do it.

132
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,353
I should catch up.

133
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,867
Does Geon-hu come to school to sleep?

134
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,744
Doesn't his arm hurt?

135
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,498
Is he not competing anymore?

136
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,375
No, he badly injured his shoulder.

137
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,001
He might have to give up hockey.

138
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:05,002
Seriously?

139
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,880
-Didn't he start in elementary school?
-Yes.

140
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,425
It must be upsetting for him.

141
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:12,677
Guys!

142
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,388
They'll accept C as well
for question number 25 in English.

143
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:16,764
The teachers agreed.

144
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,807
-Really?
-Yes.

145
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,433
-So there are two answers?
-Yes.

146
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:21,519
I guessed C. Awesome.

147
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:22,895
-Yes!
-Yes!

148
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:23,854
They can't do that.

149
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,023
That's absurd.

150
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,320
What the…

151
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,738
What's her deal?

152
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,906
This is unfair.

153
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,741
The question may have been vague,

154
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,868
but there were those
who correctly picked D.

155
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:41,289
It's absurd for them to get the same score
as those who picked C.

156
00:09:41,372 --> 00:09:42,582
That's true.

157
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,628
But Su-a, the teacher who made
that question acknowledged their mistake.

158
00:09:47,712 --> 00:09:50,381
And we already agreed
to accept both answers,

159
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,882
so it can't be helped.

160
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,634
We've already graded the tests too.

161
00:09:53,718 --> 00:09:54,802
Already?

162
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:57,597
Then what's the cutoff for Level 1?
By how much did it go up?

163
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:00,266
You see…

164
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:06,897
In the All Care Program curriculum,

165
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:11,193
don't you think the Language Arts class
is weaker than other subjects?

166
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,905
We should address this with the academy
or have makeup classes.

167
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,159
They need more classes
during the exam weeks.

168
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:20,745
Our kids need to be
on their toes at all times.

169
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:25,791
You have a lot to say
for someone who came late.

170
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,921
And we're all strict
when it comes to our kids' studies,

171
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:32,673
but you're going overboard.

172
00:10:33,299 --> 00:10:35,718
Go easy on your son,
or he'll go down the wrong path.

173
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,139
But Sun-jae is such an obedient kid.

174
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,016
Who knows?

175
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,479
Kids like Su-a who whine and complain
tend to be healthier.

176
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:49,190
Those who are obedient
stay bottled up and flip out later.

177
00:10:50,107 --> 00:10:52,860
Remember that case from a decade ago?

178
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:56,656
A girl from this area committed suicide
after taking so many academy classes.

179
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:59,909
And her younger sibling
pushed their mom to her death.

180
00:11:00,701 --> 00:11:01,535
Really?

181
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:02,953
-Yes.
-But I thought

182
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:06,248
the kid was acquitted
due to lack of evidence.

183
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,249
No.

184
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,751
Sure, that was the outcome.

185
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,253
But circumstantial evidence
says otherwise.

186
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,089
That kid resented the mother

187
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,632
and pushed her off the balcony.

188
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:15,925
Goodness.

189
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:19,345
I heard this from a police officer
in the investigation.

190
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:24,141
Did you know that in Korea, less than
one percent of suspects are acquitted?

191
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:29,522
It is ignorant and dangerous
to accuse the acquitted of being guilty.

192
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:32,983
"Ignorant"?

193
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:36,612
Did you just outright call me stupid?

194
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:38,989
Jeez, Ms. Jang.

195
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,991
You sure are rude.

196
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:46,789
Or do you just
lack social skills or something?

197
00:11:51,585 --> 00:11:53,045
Why are you laughing?

198
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:58,008
It's funny to hear that from someone
who doesn't contribute to society.

199
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,887
Are you serious right now?

200
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,056
Come on. Don't ruin the mood.

201
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,684
Ms. Jang, please stop.

202
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:08,811
Hey.

203
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,897
You're a year younger than me, right?
I'll speak casually to you.

204
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,234
Do us moms look like a joke to you

205
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:17,319
just because you're a lawyer?

206
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,780
I don't contribute to society?

207
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:24,702
You have the audacity to criticize us
after coming late just because you work.

208
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:28,497
Hey.

209
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,167
Who are you to look down on me?

210
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,126
Come on.

211
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,252
I'm Suaimdang.

212
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,797
Do you think these moms
will side with me or with you?

213
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:38,424
-Ms. Cho.
-Answer me!

214
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,887
Are you challenging me? Are you?

215
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,600
Why aren't you talking?

216
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,102
You're looking down on me, aren't you?

217
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:54,899
Will you not answer me?

218
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,957
-Hey!
-Gosh!

219
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,084
-You little…
-Su-hui.

220
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:15,169
-Please calm down.
-Move.

221
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,298
I'm okay.

222
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,842
I'm okay.

223
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,976
Ms. Jang.

224
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:36,982
Ms. Jang!

225
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:41,529
Don't leave like this.
It's not like you'll never see her again.

226
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,822
I don't plan on it.

227
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,919
Su-hui, don't be so upset.

228
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,588
You're the leader of this gathering.

229
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,925
Leader, my foot. What kind of leader
is looked down on like this?

230
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,343
But still,

231
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:08,264
you shouldn't fight when our kids
haven't even started their first class.

232
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,516
-Why don't you reconcile--
-Forget it.

233
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,687
This is annoying, so you should go.
I need to pick up Su-a.

234
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,146
Just go.

235
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:25,489
Even kids don't fight
in such a primitive way.

236
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,409
They're full-grown adults.

237
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:30,202
Moms of the All Care Program at that.

238
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:32,663
But they became so immature
when they saw red.

239
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,123
So who won?

240
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,250
No one won.

241
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,294
Whether someone's learned
or just on a power trip,

242
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:40,087
they're all childish
once they start fighting.

243
00:14:40,629 --> 00:14:43,632
Su-a's mom got all worked up
and started bombarding her with words.

244
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,594
And Sun-jae's mom
just stared at her, then…

245
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,221
That was her final blow.

246
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:50,306
Seriously?

247
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,349
Sun-jae's mom was the winner.

248
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,268
She's like a jaguar.

249
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:56,729
Jaguars kill their prey
with one final blow.

250
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,857
I'm worried that the group
will come to an end

251
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,567
before the program even starts.

252
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,570
You think they would
see each other again after that?

253
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,779
-I'm back.
-Hey.

254
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,780
-Hi, Hae-e.
-Hey.

255
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:07,865
Hi, Hae-e.

256
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:09,700
Mom, guess what?

257
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,037
I got Level 1 for the math final.

258
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,124
You always barely managed to get Level 2.

259
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,085
You did so well. Come here.

260
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:21,587
I'm so proud of you.

261
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:23,255
Mom.

262
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,466
What's with your face?

263
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,009
It's nothing.

264
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,386
I'm so proud of you. Well done.

265
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,431
It's all thanks to Mr. Choi.

266
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,683
He really helped us fully prepare for it.

267
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,646
This kiwi is red.

268
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,023
These red ones are full of vitamins.

269
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,235
-It's very sweet.
-Yes. This is just for you.

270
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,320
Thank you.

271
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,657
Mom.

272
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:51,909
I suddenly feel motivated.

273
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,077
To do what?

274
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,912
I'm going to study as best as I can

275
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,665
and become the top student
in the country for the CSAT.

276
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,625
That's too much.

277
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,585
Don't be too greedy.

278
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,504
No, I want to.

279
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:05,464
I want to appear on the news.

280
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:08,425
Who knows? Maybe she'll see me.

281
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:13,222
Who?

282
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:15,933
You know. The one who abandoned me.

283
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,561
But I don't know
if that'll be sweet revenge.

284
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:28,487
Mom, I'm craving
your braised chicken for dinner.

285
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,991
-Sure. I'll make some for you.
-Okay.

286
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,283
Is it good?

287
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:34,368
Yes.

288
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,125
Eat up.

289
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:43,335
Thanks.

290
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,007
Su-a, this is the first time
you didn't get Level 1 in English.

291
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,175
It's not the end of the world.

292
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,261
You got Level 1 on all the other subjects.

293
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,054
Your CSAT is your strength anyway.

294
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,598
I was supposed to be Level 1!

295
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:00,853
It's all because of Hae-e.

296
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,272
From that side dish store?

297
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,357
What did she do this time?

298
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,610
She's the reason why
I was lowered to Level 2!

299
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:12,281
Because of her, the teacher accepted
multiple answers for a question,

300
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,992
and the cutoff for Level 1
went up by two points.

301
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,453
Goodness.

302
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,080
Why does she keep getting in your way?

303
00:17:20,164 --> 00:17:21,749
That little brat.

304
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,502
I don't know! I hate her so much!

305
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:26,587
Goodness.

306
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,173
I already hate that we're classmates,

307
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:32,009
so how do you expect me
to be in the same program as her?

308
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:34,553
I'm so stressed out that I want to die!

309
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:36,430
Don't say that!

310
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,182
Watch what you say!

311
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:39,516
"I want to die"?

312
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,852
Don't scare me like that. Come here.

313
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,770
Su-a.

314
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,272
Have some water. Here.

315
00:17:45,856 --> 00:17:47,649
You're going to get dehydrated.

316
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:48,609
Drink up.

317
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,277
It's lukewarm.

318
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,820
I don't want it!

319
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:53,864
Gosh.

320
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:57,076
Why would you force her to drink that?

321
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:59,244
Wipe it up.

322
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:00,287
All right.

323
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,171
Hello?

324
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,340
Who is this?

325
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,014
I spoke with Director Kang.

326
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,851
He said your opinion was crucial

327
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,187
in getting Young-min
into the All Care Program.

328
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,065
That's why I requested that we meet.

329
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:32,528
Right. I do have quite the influence.

330
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:36,782
Young-min lost his concentration
during the level test

331
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,909
because he was bothered

332
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,661
by some kid in his class.

333
00:18:40,744 --> 00:18:43,038
He's a very competent boy.

334
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,583
He's been following The Pride's curriculum

335
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:49,586
for his grades and the CSAT.

336
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:53,215
So I thought he would definitely
get into the All Care Program.

337
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,635
I'm just very flustered.

338
00:18:58,887 --> 00:18:59,847
I'd appreciate it

339
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:02,349
if you could convince the other moms

340
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:06,061
to allow Young-min
to study with their kids.

341
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:07,896
I'm not too sure.

342
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:13,443
There must be a reason why
only seven kids are in that program.

343
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,613
I don't think it's right to change that.

344
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:24,246
But perhaps there's a way
to bring in your son

345
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:27,207
and still maintain
the same number of students.

346
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:28,167
How?

347
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,710
Actually,

348
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:34,006
there's one student who might not be
at the same level as our kids.

349
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:08,916
I can't believe I made this.

350
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,127
Should I sell some this evening?

351
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,213
Forget it.

352
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,798
I won't be making
much money off of it anyway.

353
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,759
It's a pity, but it'll be for just us--

354
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:23,639
But that would be a shame.

355
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,943
Mr. Choi.

356
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,696
I've prepared a special meal to celebrate
Hae-e's Level 1 achievement in math.

357
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:43,200
Please stop by later this evening
after your classes.

358
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,661
From Nam Haeng-seon of Nation's Best.

359
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:48,872
"Nam Haeng-seon."

360
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:51,625
What a name.

361
00:20:52,918 --> 00:20:54,461
It suits her.

362
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,839
Nation's Best…

363
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:01,343
MS. NAM HAENG-SEON
OF NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

364
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:06,390
Mr. Choi, I added an extra shot.

365
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,559
I'm not drinking coffee today.

366
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:10,477
You can have it.

367
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,105
You always have some before class
to give you energy.

368
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:15,983
But today, I'm going to try
to maintain an empty stomach.

369
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,026
I already have more than enough energy.

370
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,027
I'm feeling great!

371
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:48,390
Wait.

372
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,357
About earlier today…

373
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,740
I got too worked up.

374
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,660
But then again, you did provoke me.

375
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:09,953
What is this?

376
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:14,374
Anyway,

377
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,294
let bygones be bygones.

378
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,379
Care to have some tea with me?

379
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,510
So let me get this straight.

380
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:31,725
You want my approval
to replace Hae-e with Young-min.

381
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,269
Is that correct?

382
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,937
No, that's not what I mean.

383
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:37,439
Well…

384
00:22:40,609 --> 00:22:41,860
Yes, that's correct.

385
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,112
I guess it boils down to that.

386
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,785
But this isn't just for Su-a--

387
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:54,247
No, thank you.
I don't want to get involved in this.

388
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,000
Seeing how you're seeking our approval,

389
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,461
it doesn't seem approved by the academy.

390
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,215
And I don't remember reading about
that restriction in the announcement.

391
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:06,510
I think that's a violation of
the Act on Fair Labeling and Advertising.

392
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,886
Right, that.

393
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:10,222
I'll pretend that I didn't hear this.

394
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:43,046
So exactly what is your plan?

395
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:51,221
1:7 ALL CARE PROGRAM
WITH STAR TEACHERS FOR THE TOP 0.01%

396
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:55,016
How should the graph look
to maximize the value of a sub ten?

397
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,144
It should lean to the right.

398
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,854
Then what are the values?

399
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:03,233
They're 2, 3, and 12.
Then what about a sub 10?

400
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:05,152
So a sub ten is…

401
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,114
a sub six plus five times four,

402
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,032
which equals 22.

403
00:24:11,116 --> 00:24:12,325
Did you get that?

404
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,577
-Yes.
-Yes.

405
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:16,663
What's going on? Why are you so down?

406
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,582
Tired since we're nearing the end?

407
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,750
Should I rejuvenate you?

408
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,210
-Yes.
-Yes.

409
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:25,839
I only do this the day before the CSAT.

410
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,436
Okay.

411
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,980
That's it for today.

412
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:45,150
Do talk to my teaching assistants
if you need any help.

413
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,109
And I'm…

414
00:24:47,110 --> 00:24:48,361
Choi Chi-yeol.

415
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,030
Bye, guys.

416
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,033
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

417
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,040
Do you have any questions?

418
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,541
No, not today.

419
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:05,921
Will I get to ask him questions directly
in the All Care Program?

420
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:07,380
Yes, it's only a few of us.

421
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,674
I'm getting butterflies.

422
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:13,428
What's going on?
Have you also become a fan of his?

423
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,180
Yes. Ever since my first class.

424
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,766
His explanations are simple
and to the point.

425
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,060
I have my trust in him for the CSAT.

426
00:25:20,143 --> 00:25:22,979
Gosh, you even got into the program too.
A dream come true.

427
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:46,211
I wonder what she made
that she even texted me about it.

428
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,129
A special meal?

429
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:50,131
Could it be eel?

430
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,926
I prefer webfoot octopus.

431
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,722
I'm so hungry.

432
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:04,813
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

433
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,984
You didn't have to come out.

434
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,151
Ms. Nam, I'm…

435
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,948
Wait. Where are you going?
Where's my special meal?

436
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,826
What's going on?

437
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,953
I'd like to ask you the same question.

438
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:22,080
Let go. I need to look into this.

439
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,083
What's going on?

440
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,961
She was the one
who got me all excited about the food.

441
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,219
What is it, Mr. Ji?

442
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,304
Mr. Choi,

443
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,181
I think there has been a change
in the All Care Program.

444
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,266
What change?

445
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:47,647
What in the world is going on?

446
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,566
We were told we were accepted yesterday,

447
00:26:49,649 --> 00:26:51,526
and I even met with the other moms today.

448
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:52,986
But she's disqualified now?

449
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:56,072
Ma'am, please calm down first.

450
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,366
How could I possibly calm down?

451
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,661
Is this academy a joke?
Is studying a joke?

452
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,413
Of course not, ma'am.

453
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:06,333
We acknowledge our mistake.

454
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,959
But it is part of our rule

455
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,212
to only accept students
for the All Care Program

456
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:15,008
who have attended
all of the star teachers' classes.

457
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,301
What kind of rule is that?

458
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,136
When did you set that up?

459
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,430
That wasn't in the announcement.

460
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:23,683
Look. "Requirements."

461
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:27,020
"Open to any 11th grader
who has passed the level test."

462
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:30,774
Those were the only requirements,
so when was that rule made?

463
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:35,445
Ma'am, it's impossible to write down
all of our academy's rules.

464
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,739
Those two were the basics.

465
00:27:37,822 --> 00:27:41,951
This is neither a state institution
nor a public school.

466
00:27:42,035 --> 00:27:44,412
This is a private business.

467
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,707
It is up to the academy
to decide which students to pick.

468
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,084
Is that so?

469
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,421
This is no different from snatching away
an athlete's hard-earned gold medal.

470
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,715
She took the test
and got the acceptance text.

471
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:56,925
Now you take it back?

472
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,344
How could such a big academy
do something like this?

473
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,221
How could you use your power like this?

474
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:02,389
Ma'am.

475
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,780
I'm okay.

476
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,284
I'm really okay.

477
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,413
I told you before that the program
was too much pressure.

478
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,791
I never needed to attend an academy
to get good grades.

479
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:33,336
The math class is enough for me. Really.

480
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,880
-So don't get all worked up.
-Hey, but still--

481
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,757
Even the name is cheesy.

482
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,218
"All Care"? It's so tacky.

483
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:44,597
So don't worry about me, okay?

484
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,064
That requirement is news to me.

485
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,316
Since when did we have that?

486
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,568
It's one of the basics.

487
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:24,531
We've only been accepting students
who followed our curriculum.

488
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,200
But that student only took
a month's worth of your class.

489
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,078
You know the difficulty level
of the All Care Program.

490
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:32,747
How can she keep up with the others

491
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,583
when she hasn't taken
the previous classes?

492
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,920
If she needed to take prior courses,
she could've taken online classes

493
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,338
or been given extra material.

494
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,590
It wouldn't have been a problem at all.

495
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:45,593
She proved herself
by passing the level test.

496
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:48,304
So how could you take back her acceptance?

497
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:51,516
DIRECTOR KANG JUN-SANG

498
00:30:52,767 --> 00:30:56,729
Mr. Choi, I'm a businessman.

499
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:59,732
I have my reasons for doing this.

500
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,819
Could you please just

501
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,280
turn a blind eye to this?

502
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:06,781
Please?

503
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,368
Okay.

504
00:31:11,327 --> 00:31:12,161
Okay.

505
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,330
Thanks, Mr. Choi. I'll repay--

506
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,416
I'd like to opt out of this as well.

507
00:31:16,499 --> 00:31:17,709
Opt out of what?

508
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:18,877
The All Care Program?

509
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,003
Yes, I'm out.

510
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:22,964
You see, I find corruption
and shadiness detestable.

511
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:25,008
"Corruption"? That's a bit harsh!

512
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,384
I had my reasons--

513
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:28,803
I'm sure you had your reasons.

514
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:31,431
But I'm a teacher, not a director.

515
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,850
I hate how shady this is.

516
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,268
If you were going to do this,

517
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:38,146
why did I make the test,
and why did the students take it?

518
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,606
I just don't understand.

519
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,942
I'm really not amused by this.

520
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,569
I'm dropping out.

521
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:52,368
Don't do this.
You're essential to the program.

522
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:55,496
We've been doing well lately, right?

523
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,499
You improved my reputation
by doing the admission talk show.

524
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,503
The moms will have a fit.

525
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,714
Your name was on the announcement!

526
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,466
If you leave, it's a scam!

527
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,967
Do you want me behind bars?

528
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,761
In that case, when you added my name,

529
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:13,306
you should've checked that
you posted all of the requirements.

530
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:16,559
Let's just do it for now. Okay?

531
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:20,480
Let's worry about the future later.
I'll take responsibility for everything.

532
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,190
I find that detestable as well.

533
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,233
Acting first, thinking later.

534
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:27,946
Changing your mind would be quicker
than trying to change mine.

535
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,992
You know this is a breach of contract.

536
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:34,452
I'll call the legal team.

537
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,788
Sure. I'll see you in court then.

538
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,757
What did he say? Did it work out?

539
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,258
No.

540
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:51,344
It's not easy.

541
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,223
I thought so too.

542
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:58,267
I asked the head manager too,
and I think everything is set.

543
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,270
So I said I'd drop out too.

544
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,648
Did you have to do that?

545
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,233
This is unfair, you know?

546
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:08,486
I don't know what the deal is,
and I don't want to know either.

547
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:11,948
But saying yes to this
will only bring more corruption.

548
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:14,325
I don't want to get involved whatsoever.

549
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,662
I understand,

550
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:20,289
but the other students
in the program will suffer too.

551
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,291
I'm sure the academy is aware of that.

552
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:26,546
But if they still don't listen to me,
it means there's some sort of corruption.

553
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,507
Let's see what he decides to do.

554
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,300
You're being inconsistent again.

555
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,262
-What?
-You said you couldn't look after

556
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,222
every student in your classes.

557
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:37,598
But look at you now.

558
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,560
That's not why.
I just don't like what he's doing.

559
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,817
You better not post anything
on your social media

560
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,028
about how I put my students first.

561
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:51,529
I don't use social media.

562
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,572
I know that.

563
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,074
Why don't you?

564
00:33:55,658 --> 00:33:56,826
Aren't you Gen Z?

565
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,401
-No!
-Move.

566
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,695
Catch it.

567
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,864
-That was close.
-Watch out!

568
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,076
I'm scared.

569
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,206
-Nice.
-Good one.

570
00:35:30,878 --> 00:35:31,921
Move back.

571
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:50,606
-Hae-e!
-Are you okay?

572
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:53,442
Are you all right? Put your head back.

573
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,862
You're bleeding. Anyone have tissues?

574
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,657
Hey, move. That's not how you do it.

575
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:02,326
Spit out the blood.

576
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,996
I'm okay.

577
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,874
He's giving me butterflies.

578
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:24,265
-You should talk to her.
-Okay.

579
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,893
-Hello.
-Hello, Ms. Nam!

580
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:29,395
Hey, Haeng-seon.

581
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,355
I heard about Hae-e.

582
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:34,150
I can't believe it.

583
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:36,986
They should've told you
the requirements in advance.

584
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,362
I was so upset to hear that.

585
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:39,947
Oh, well.

586
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,949
By the way,

587
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,202
I'm sorry to ask you this, but…

588
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:47,455
could you leave our All Care group chat?

589
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,790
We need to share information,

590
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,127
but we're hesitant
because you're still in there.

591
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,253
Okay, I'll do that.

592
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:55,463
Wait.

593
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:57,089
Could you do it right now?

594
00:36:58,925 --> 00:37:01,010
I need to invite the new kid's mother too.

595
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:13,773
Done.

596
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:17,151
-Thanks.
-Don't be too disheartened!

597
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,904
Dan-ji didn't even make it
into that program!

598
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,325
Can you leave
if you're not going to buy anything?

599
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,577
Goodbye.

600
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,002
Haeng-seon.

601
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:45,721
Are you okay?

602
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,723
Shouldn't you see the nurse?

603
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,517
No, I'm okay.

604
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,270
Wasn't Geon-hu so amazing?

605
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:55,231
He grabbed her nose
and then lowered her head.

606
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,110
This is bad.

607
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,903
I have a crush on him.

608
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,571
Hey, congratulations.

609
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,531
Good luck.

610
00:38:06,534 --> 00:38:08,536
What's going on with me these days?

611
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:12,123
I was kicked out of the program
and got a bloody nose from Su-a.

612
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,002
Where are you going?

613
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,254
I'm even in charge of recycling today.

614
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:22,341
I'll give 1,000 won to anyone
who's unluckier than I am.

615
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:24,927
Do you want me to come?

616
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:28,389
No. I need some alone time.

617
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:43,738
Come on.

618
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,532
Why are you doing this to me?

619
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,242
Why?

620
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:52,038
Let me speak to your director.

621
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:53,873
I said he's not here right now.

622
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,834
Ma'am, please book an appointment
and come back.

623
00:38:56,917 --> 00:38:59,295
You're putting us
in a pickle by doing this.

624
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:00,421
You're in a pickle?

625
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,341
I'm the one who's actually in a pickle.

626
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,761
You said it was up to the academy,
and the director is the boss here.

627
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:08,512
-So let me speak to him.
-Ma'am.

628
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,181
Why won't you let me see him?

629
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:11,891
Then who can I talk to about this?

630
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:13,517
I understand, ma'am.

631
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:15,478
I'll relay the message when he arrives.

632
00:39:15,561 --> 00:39:17,563
I'll call you later, so please go home.

633
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:18,564
You won't call me.

634
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,776
I know you won't call me.

635
00:39:21,859 --> 00:39:22,693
Aren't I right?

636
00:39:24,236 --> 00:39:25,488
I'll wait here.

637
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,657
I'll wait for him,
so you can go do your jobs.

638
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,829
Ma'am, you can't do this.

639
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,207
No, you can go do your job.

640
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,667
-Ma'am.
-Please get up.

641
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,628
-What are you doing? Let me go.
-Please get up.

642
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:42,421
-This way.
-What is this?

643
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:45,508
-Ma'am.
-I'm going to wait for him.

644
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,219
Come again.

645
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,303
Okay.

646
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:55,101
Jae-woo, call your sister again.

647
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,937
Where did she go in the middle of the day?

648
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:04,026
Yeong-ju, why do you never call her
and always make me do it?

649
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,445
I can call her myself.

650
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:07,613
But…

651
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,281
Hey.

652
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,450
Just do as I say.

653
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,412
You've sure grown up a lot, Jae-woo.

654
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,832
Back then, you were too scared
to look me in the eye.

655
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,167
I must be too lenient with you these days.

656
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,961
Should I teach you a lesson?

657
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,922
I was never afraid of you.

658
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,216
-Really?
-No.

659
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,844
Haeng-seon is the scary one.

660
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,680
She turns into a lunatic
when she gets mad.

661
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,806
You're right.

662
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,142
When she goes crazy,
she becomes downright insane.

663
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,226
She becomes a lunatic.

664
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,020
You got that right.

665
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:47,653
Haeng-seon.

666
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,905
Where have you been?

667
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,618
What are you doing? Where are you going?

668
00:40:54,702 --> 00:40:55,744
Haeng-seon.

669
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:57,329
Nam Haeng-seon!

670
00:40:57,997 --> 00:41:00,291
1:7 ALL CARE PROGRAM
WITH STAR TEACHERS FOR THE TOP 0.01%

671
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,293
Hello, everyone.

672
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,337
I am the mother of a teenage daughter,

673
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:08,257
and I run a side dish store
in this neighborhood.

674
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,969
First of all, I apologize for this ruckus.

675
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,014
But I just can't condone
the treatment I have received recently.

676
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,349
Let me explain.

677
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:21,103
My daughter had been accepted

678
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,980
to the Med School All Care Program.

679
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:27,193
But suddenly, she was kicked out
on the pretext of an obscure rule.

680
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:32,448
To Director Kang Jun-sang of The Pride,
who won't even see me,

681
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,618
I officially request a meeting!

682
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:39,663
Sir, I'd like to speak with you!

683
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,583
The lowest thing you can do

684
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,752
is to take back something
you've already given.

685
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:47,755
You shouldn't have accepted her
in the first place,

686
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:50,132
or you should offer
a plausible explanation for her removal.

687
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:02,269
-Hello, Director Kang.
-Hi.

688
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,812
-Director Kang.
-Yes?

689
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,065
Who are you again?

690
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:08,776
I'm Nam Hae-e's mom.
Could you spare me a minute, please?

691
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:09,693
I see.

692
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:12,154
I'm sorry, but I have a meeting to attend.

693
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,280
-Next time.
-Wait.

694
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:14,782
You're avoiding me, aren't you?

695
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:16,325
Why are you avoiding me?

696
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,160
You're in a pickle, right?

697
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,995
No, it's not like that.

698
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,581
Then what is it? Help me understand!

699
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,833
Why is my daughter disqualified?

700
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:25,751
-Tell me.
-Look.

701
00:42:26,252 --> 00:42:29,255
I'll tell someone at work
to call you immediately.

702
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:36,679
-Gosh.
-Are you okay?

703
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:40,474
Damn it.

704
00:42:42,685 --> 00:42:43,519
Are you all right?

705
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,730
-Oh, no.
-Darn it.

706
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:59,243
Did that lady leave yet?

707
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,620
She's still waiting for you outside.

708
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,622
She must've been flustered too

709
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:06,250
because she kept asking
the front desk if you were okay.

710
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,836
Why does she care about me now?

711
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:12,673
This is actually better.
Report her for obstruction of business.

712
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,383
You want me to report this?

713
00:43:14,466 --> 00:43:15,384
Right now?

714
00:43:15,467 --> 00:43:17,511
Then when? After she leaves?

715
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,974
She's giving us a good reason to do so.
Obstruction of business.

716
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,685
How could I accept the student of a mother

717
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,729
who caused my injury?

718
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:28,856
Just blacklist her.

719
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:31,400
Okay? What was her name again?

720
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,735
Nam Hae-e.

721
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,863
That's not a bad idea. Blacklisting her.

722
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,032
Win the public over.

723
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,909
If necessary, post about this online
and include her initials.

724
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:41,952
Yes, sir.

725
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:54,590
THE PRIDE

726
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,834
Let go of me.

727
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:32,086
What are you doing?

728
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,713
I usually find interfering
in other people's business detestable.

729
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:37,257
But you're so frustrating.
Why are you so reckless?

730
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:39,134
Did you think this would solve it?

731
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,386
Then what should I do?

732
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:42,096
Should I just give up? I'm…

733
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:44,473
I'm her mom after all.

734
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:50,896
Then you should've done something wiser,
not thrown straws against the wind.

735
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,941
Or just…

736
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,693
Just don't do anything because I'm…

737
00:45:01,281 --> 00:45:02,282
Your daughter

738
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,495
can't take any
of our academy's classes now.

739
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:08,997
She's blacklisted. Do you get it?

740
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,125
Blacklisted?

741
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,128
It's their way of dealing with all sorts
of parents and students.

742
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,923
So Hae-e is banned
from taking your regular classes?

743
00:45:18,006 --> 00:45:19,299
Because of what I did?

744
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,097
What a scary bunch of people.

745
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,392
It's their job to teach students.

746
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:31,687
But they toy with and blacklist her
because I demanded an explanation?

747
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,855
Unbelievable.

748
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:34,815
Just unbelievable.

749
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,693
So why would you…

750
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:42,906
This is why I don't make friends.
I get concerned.

751
00:45:45,742 --> 00:45:47,202
I understand.

752
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,579
I won't concern you anymore.

753
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,914
I'll stop here.

754
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,041
Her grades may improve
thanks to your academy,

755
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:54,710
but there's nothing more to learn.

756
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,463
I don't want to send her there anymore.

757
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,739
It's already shiny enough.

758
00:46:24,239 --> 00:46:26,033
You can stop wiping.

759
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,037
You've been wiping
for the past hour and 18 minutes.

760
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,330
Doesn't your arm hurt?

761
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:40,088
Hello, this is Nation's Best Banchan.

762
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,299
Sure, we do deliveries.

763
00:46:43,133 --> 00:46:44,968
Thirty-two lunch boxes? Your address?

764
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,097
The Pride Academy counseling room?

765
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,391
It'll take about 30 minutes.

766
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:52,851
We'll deliver to--

767
00:46:53,519 --> 00:46:54,520
Excuse me.

768
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:57,147
We won't accept any orders.
You can order from elsewhere.

769
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,068
No. We're not selling to The Pride.

770
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,237
It's up to me as the owner. Don't ask why.

771
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:04,196
I'm hanging up.

772
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:20,128
Mr. Ji, let's stop by Nation's Best.

773
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:22,631
Okay.

774
00:47:24,132 --> 00:47:29,179
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

775
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,611
She's taking it this far?

776
00:47:48,448 --> 00:47:49,950
Should I talk to her?

777
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:53,245
You tried to get Nam Hae-e
back into that program.

778
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,329
There's no need.

779
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:56,748
Forget it.

780
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:05,716
WE DON'T SELL TO THOSE
AFFILIATED WITH THE PRIDE ACADEMY

781
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:08,302
STUDENTS AND PARENTS ARE EXCEPTIONS
OWNER NAM HAENG-SEON

782
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,311
Good work in Season 2.

783
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:19,021
We'll meet again in Season 3.

784
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:24,192
Take care of yourselves until then.

785
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,862
Admissions is a long fight.

786
00:48:27,571 --> 00:48:30,991
And I hope all of you become winners.

787
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:33,535
This is the end of Season 2.

788
00:48:33,619 --> 00:48:35,203
I'm Choi Chi-yeol.

789
00:48:36,121 --> 00:48:38,123
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

790
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:47,132
-Thank you.
-You did well.

791
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,383
-You too.
-Mr. Choi!

792
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,179
Mr. Choi, you're not dropping out
of the All Care Program, are you?

793
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:53,680
It's a rumor, right?

794
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,015
That can't happen.

795
00:48:55,098 --> 00:48:57,225
I only applied for it because of you.

796
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,519
Please don't leave us. Please?

797
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,273
I understand. Let me think about it.

798
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,610
No, Mr. Choi. Promise us.

799
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,321
I'm betting my life on this program.

800
00:49:09,404 --> 00:49:11,907
I'll do my utmost best
and get into my dream university.

801
00:49:11,990 --> 00:49:13,784
Why would you abandon us
for just one student?

802
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:15,827
We're really desperate.

803
00:49:15,911 --> 00:49:17,954
Please give us your word.

804
00:49:24,836 --> 00:49:26,630
You didn't have anything except coffee.

805
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:27,798
-Hello.
-Come eat.

806
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:30,926
I ordered some rice with grilled eel,
pizza, and other dishes too.

807
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,387
-I see.
-This looks good.

808
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:36,890
All right. Let's eat.

809
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,684
-Thank you for the meal.
-Thank you for the meal.

810
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,768
Enjoy the meal.

811
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:40,769
Have some pizza.

812
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,521
Look at this.

813
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,523
What is this?

814
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:47,818
-Is this salad?
-It's tasty.

815
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,864
This brick-oven pizza tastes pretty good.

816
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:54,783
-Right?
-Right?

817
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,827
I want some pizza.

818
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,578
-Do you want one?
-Yes. I want this.

819
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,247
-Have some eel.
-Okay.

820
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:48,336
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

821
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:06,438
So y equals x.

822
00:51:08,523 --> 00:51:10,484
They're symmetrical. Then what about p?

823
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:13,695
Like this, then q…

824
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:19,451
It'll look like this.
Once you substitute it, K is…

825
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:22,788
four.

826
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,707
Mr. Choi, I'm sleepy.

827
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,460
Can you show us your signature kick?

828
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:32,547
You're sleepy? We're only halfway done.

829
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:34,007
You shouldn't be sleepy just--

830
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:36,885
-Come on.
-Come on.

831
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,887
-Again.
-Again.

832
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,430
-Again.
-Again.

833
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:42,098
-Again.
-Again.

834
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:44,267
No, let's just move on.

835
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,062
What is the y-coordinate of p?

836
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,023
It'll be eight.

837
00:51:50,106 --> 00:51:51,233
Did you get that?

838
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:52,692
Next.

839
00:51:52,776 --> 00:51:54,569
Didn't I tell you to check in advance?

840
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,655
We already printed all these out.

841
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,657
Do you want to start all over? Do you?

842
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,492
Is that what you want?

843
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,996
Why is this here?

844
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,566
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

845
00:52:57,549 --> 00:52:58,800
I must be going insane.

846
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:01,303
Just because I can't have that lunch box,

847
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,848
I've become lethargic, sensitive,
and I'm even seeing things.

848
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,016
I've gone crazy, right?

849
00:53:07,183 --> 00:53:08,727
Are these withdrawal symptoms?

850
00:53:09,394 --> 00:53:10,228
I'm not sure.

851
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:13,064
Do you think
it's solely because of the food?

852
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:17,611
I think it's a psychological issue.

853
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:20,030
You failed to fix an unjust situation.

854
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:21,781
You feel guilty.

855
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:25,660
But you can't drop out of the program
since your students are begging you.

856
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,287
Maybe that's why…

857
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:30,165
you're mad at yourself.

858
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,378
After all, you're a very upright person.

859
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,718
Let's substitute these numbers.

860
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,679
So n is greater than nine

861
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,765
and less than 16.

862
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,351
Then what's the sum?

863
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:51,645
Seventy…

864
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,990
Who said you could sit?

865
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,575
Get out.

866
00:54:06,284 --> 00:54:08,995
Do you think school is a place
you come to just for fun?

867
00:54:10,205 --> 00:54:11,331
Go stand in the hall!

868
00:54:41,736 --> 00:54:43,363
Will you continue coming to school?

869
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,156
Make up your mind.

870
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,871
If it's a no, you can formally drop out.

871
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,623
I don't want that.

872
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:55,750
So you want to come?

873
00:54:56,668 --> 00:55:00,255
Then at least come to school
on time like the others do.

874
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,385
I know you might have to give up hockey.

875
00:55:06,261 --> 00:55:07,929
I know that's difficult to accept.

876
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,307
But I hope you won't feel lost
for too long.

877
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,977
You're only 18.

878
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:16,646
You have so many options in life.

879
00:55:17,272 --> 00:55:18,189
Do you know that?

880
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,401
Take some time

881
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,028
and seriously think…

882
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,989
about what you want to do.

883
00:55:28,033 --> 00:55:29,117
Start off with that.

884
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,804
Can I get
the All Care workbooks by 6 p.m.?

885
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,806
Yes, I believe so. Let me check again.

886
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,183
How many people are grading?

887
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,310
-I'm going.
-One is not enough.

888
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:57,771
There's a free-response question,
so I need two more.

889
00:55:57,854 --> 00:55:59,939
Okay, then I'll bring
Sang-jin and Jong-seo.

890
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,316
Okay. We need to talk.

891
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,112
Are you okay?

892
00:56:09,616 --> 00:56:11,868
I'm going to be there
when they take the test,

893
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,161
so let's depart earlier.

894
00:56:13,995 --> 00:56:16,331
I need to see how they solve the problems.

895
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:18,333
That's the benefit of a small class and--

896
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,460
All right, but you should rest for now.

897
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:22,962
And have this.

898
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:26,508
You're going to collapse
before the program even begins.

899
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,551
Then the moms will have a fit.

900
00:56:29,344 --> 00:56:31,137
"Why didn't you take care of yourself?"

901
00:56:31,638 --> 00:56:33,431
"Our kids will fail because of you."

902
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:35,892
Thank you.

903
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:44,109
I think it's a psychological issue.

904
00:56:44,192 --> 00:56:47,487
You failed to fix an unjust situation.
You feel guilty.

905
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:53,326
But you can't drop out of the program
since your students are begging you.

906
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:56,830
Maybe that's why you're mad at yourself.

907
00:57:04,504 --> 00:57:08,216
SKYMOM.NET
SPOTTED MR. CHOI AT A CAFE

908
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:24,482
So about that star teacher…

909
00:57:26,359 --> 00:57:30,071
He used to come here all the time.
But now that he's nowhere to be seen,

910
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,906
I kind of miss him.

911
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,200
I also miss seeing
his fragile and pale manager.

912
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:40,540
I get that you're upset
because of Hae-e's situation.

913
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:44,169
But I think you're being a bit petty
by not selling food

914
00:57:44,252 --> 00:57:46,671
to those affiliated with that academy.

915
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:48,965
The workers there are innocent.
Don't you agree?

916
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:51,551
What else can I do?
This is my only weapon.

917
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:58,766
Is Hae-e okay with studying
on her own again?

918
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:01,269
She's not the type to show her feelings.

919
00:58:02,770 --> 00:58:04,272
But I'm sure it's tough on her.

920
00:58:08,776 --> 00:58:11,738
Should we have a drink after work?
It's been a while.

921
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,989
Forget it.

922
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,074
You have that dance club after work.

923
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:17,452
If you want,
I can always take a rain check.

924
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,662
Don't do that.

925
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:23,416
Go flirt with your fling.
At least one of us should be happy.

926
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,880
The Med School All Care Program
starts today.

927
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:30,381
You must be nervous.

928
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,967
Why would I be? It's just studying.

929
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:36,346
It's different.
You'll be studying with six Su-as.

930
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,932
Jeez. I can predict how it'll be.

931
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,768
-If Hae-e were there--
-Hey.

932
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,939
What? Don't walk on eggshells around me.

933
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:48,650
When did I ever…

934
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:50,818
Right. I did do just that.

935
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,738
Hae-e. Sun-jae.

936
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,908
I need to go to the bathroom. Bye.

937
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,203
Unbelievable.

938
00:59:04,666 --> 00:59:06,376
I'll share the workbook with you.

939
00:59:06,459 --> 00:59:07,710
Take a look and ask me questions.

940
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:08,753
Forget it.

941
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,547
It'll feel like I'm cheating.

942
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:19,889
Are you okay?

943
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:21,766
-Oh, no.
-Oh, no.

944
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,353
Gosh.

945
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,025
I'm sorry. Hold on.

946
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,529
-Where's the tissue?
-Here. I'll clean it.

947
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,698
No, let me do it.

948
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:40,994
Sorry.

949
00:59:43,705 --> 00:59:44,789
Hey, homeroom rep.

950
00:59:53,214 --> 00:59:54,757
How do I study?

951
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,344
-What?
-Teach me.

952
00:59:59,637 --> 01:00:00,805
Homeroom rep.

953
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,356
THE PRIDE ACADEMY

954
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,317
All right.

955
01:00:13,067 --> 01:00:14,068
Next question.

956
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:19,907
Within this range,
a sub n plus one times s sub n

957
01:00:20,491 --> 01:00:21,993
will be a negative number.

958
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:27,415
If n equals k, a sub n times
a sub n plus one times s sub n is…

959
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,797
Will this be a negative
or a positive number?

960
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:38,676
-A positive number.
-Right. Okay. It's a positive number.

961
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,844
So in conclusion,

962
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,598
for there to be
nine natural numbers to fit this…

963
01:00:50,271 --> 01:00:51,272
I'm sorry.

964
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,399
What is m?

965
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,569
It'll be ten. No.

966
01:00:57,528 --> 01:00:59,322
It'll be 11.

967
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:01,449
What's wrong with him?

968
01:01:01,532 --> 01:01:03,451
Why is he struggling in the first class?

969
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:05,453
What did you say?

970
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:06,996
Never mind.

971
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,499
I was just talking to myself.

972
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:12,418
I came with high hopes
for this All Care Program.

973
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:15,922
I'm sorry for disappointing you.

974
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:16,923
But as for you,

975
01:01:17,590 --> 01:01:20,843
you should learn to respect your teacher.

976
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:26,933
-"Lee Young-min"?
-This is so annoying.

977
01:01:27,016 --> 01:01:30,520
You're not even a teacher at school,
so don't try to patronize me.

978
01:01:33,064 --> 01:01:34,857
If you don't like my class, leave.

979
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:37,360
Don't bother the other students.

980
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:38,945
Damn it.

981
01:01:47,745 --> 01:01:48,746
All right.

982
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,250
Since m equals 11,

983
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:54,919
s sub ten is…

984
01:02:05,596 --> 01:02:09,142
The other teachers have had
issues with him as well.

985
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,352
He's always complaining and aggressive.

986
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,355
Kids like him deserve to be blacklisted.

987
01:02:15,523 --> 01:02:18,609
So that spot was for that girl, right?

988
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,404
He replaced her, right?

989
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:23,573
Right.

990
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:25,700
He took Hae-e's spot
after she was kicked out.

991
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:29,912
Right.

992
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:34,709
If it were her in the class,
she would be so eager to study.

993
01:02:41,883 --> 01:02:43,176
Mr. Ji, my car keys.

994
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:47,597
Wrap up and go home.

995
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,308
Where are you going?

996
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:55,104
He's so full of himself.

997
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:58,065
So what if he's the star teacher?

998
01:02:58,149 --> 01:02:59,567
He's a joke.

999
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:01,611
Hey.

1000
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,740
As a customer, was it wrong of me
to complain about the quality?

1001
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,910
So what gives him the right
to tell me to leave?

1002
01:03:10,036 --> 01:03:11,871
I'm going to tell my mom about this.

1003
01:03:11,954 --> 01:03:13,831
I'll tell her he kicked me out.

1004
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:17,668
Post it on Studyhard.com.

1005
01:03:17,752 --> 01:03:19,295
You'll get a ton of views.

1006
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,005
Should I?

1007
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,715
I hate the program.

1008
01:03:23,216 --> 01:03:25,301
And I also hate his class.

1009
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:27,428
Then ask your mom to take you out.

1010
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:29,305
I would've done so if I could.

1011
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,307
But she's one scary woman.

1012
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:35,269
If she puts her mind to it,
she can make the impossible possible.

1013
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:39,690
She even kicked out a girl
from the program to get me in there.

1014
01:03:41,234 --> 01:03:42,735
That girl must've been flustered.

1015
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:45,571
That's what happens if you have no power.

1016
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:49,784
That's exactly why
you must succeed in life.

1017
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:51,911
We can't be on the suffering end.

1018
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:55,039
We need to cut down others
the same way my mom does.

1019
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,543
So cool.

1020
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,558
What was that?

1021
01:05:09,322 --> 01:05:10,156
Damn it!

1022
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,242
Who the hell was that?

1023
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,455
Damn it!

1024
01:06:01,457 --> 01:06:08,464
STAR TEACHER CHOI CHI-YEOL
MATH ALL CARE CLASS STEP 1

1025
01:06:52,633 --> 01:06:53,676
We're closed--

1026
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:55,052
It's been a while.

1027
01:06:59,348 --> 01:07:00,516
What brings you here?

1028
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:05,980
As you already know,
we don't sell to people from--

1029
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:07,273
Let's resume the classes.

1030
01:07:08,441 --> 01:07:09,692
-Sorry?
-Your daughter.

1031
01:07:10,443 --> 01:07:11,527
I'll teach her again.

1032
01:07:12,445 --> 01:07:13,446
What do you…

1033
01:07:14,155 --> 01:07:16,449
-Did the academy change its mind?
-No.

1034
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:20,453
-Then what?
-She can take my classes

1035
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:21,620
in private.

1036
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:24,457
Are you saying…

1037
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:28,419
you'll offer private tutoring for Hae-e?

1038
01:07:41,265 --> 01:07:42,391
Under one condition.

1039
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,101
"Condition"?

1040
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,426
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1041
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:19,929
She's the very opposite of discreet.

1042
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,223
Darn it. My hands are trembling.

1043
01:08:22,306 --> 01:08:23,849
To be exact, it's not private tutoring.

1044
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:25,935
I get to eat, and she gets to study.

1045
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,520
It'll benefit both of us.

1046
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:30,189
Hello, Mr. Choi! Come in.

1047
01:08:30,773 --> 01:08:32,608
You must keep this a secret.

1048
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:34,527
Had it not been for the tutoring…

1049
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:36,153
Isn't that Ms. Nam?

1050
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:37,988
What is she doing here?

1051
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:39,740
This place is huge.

1052
01:08:40,366 --> 01:08:42,243
I guess he scarfed down everything.

1053
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,453
Is he still asleep?

1054
01:08:49,416 --> 01:08:54,421
