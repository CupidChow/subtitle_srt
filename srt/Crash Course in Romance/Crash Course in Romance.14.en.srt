1
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:56,277
My phone.

3
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:01,824
Come on.

4
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,331
UNCLE

5
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,499
Uncle.

6
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,629
SLIDE TO POWER OFF

7
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,266
-Oh, no!
-Call an ambulance.

8
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:09,809
Someone call an ambulance!

9
00:05:09,892 --> 00:05:11,311
-My gosh.
-Hurry up!

10
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,562
-Is she dead?
-She got run over?

11
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,355
-What do we do?
-She got hit by that car.

12
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,190
Is she badly hurt?

13
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:43,551
MOM, I'M SORRY…
UNCLE JAE-WOO, TAKE CARE OF MOM…

14
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,773
I can't believe this happened.

15
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:13,331
FIND THE UNIQUE SOLUTION

16
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,085
No, I'm telling you. The call
went through for about five seconds.

17
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,295
Please check again.

18
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,799
-Please hurry. Thank you.
-Your call cannot be completed…

19
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:24,967
Can they find her?

20
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,512
They're looking into it.

21
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,597
If it's true that her phone did turn on,

22
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,140
they can track down the cell tower.

23
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,103
I should look for her again.

24
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,022
It bothers me how her phone
turned on and off again.

25
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,358
It's as if Hae-e was asking us for help.

26
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,653
-Thanks. All right.
-Your call cannot be completed.

27
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,988
-Drink this, and we can go out again.
-You will be redirected…

28
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,285
Haeng-seon. Hello?

29
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:54,038
Give that to me. Is this Hae-e?

30
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,170
Yes, I'm her mom. Who is this?

31
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,340
The hospital?

32
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,561
Excuse me.

33
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,777
OPERATING CENTER

34
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,286
Jae-woo.

35
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:36,456
Let's stay strong.

36
00:07:38,332 --> 00:07:39,417
We need…

37
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,044
to protect Haeng-seon and Hae-e.

38
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,008
We're men. Right?

39
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:08,905
Sit down. We don't know
how long this will take.

40
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:19,999
Don't worry.

41
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,877
Hae-e is a strong girl.

42
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,595
Haeng-seon.

43
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,895
I can't believe this.

44
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,480
How could this happen?

45
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,899
Why would this happen to Hae-e?

46
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:49,779
Mr. Choi.

47
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,405
What do we do?

48
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,200
-Mr. Choi.
-Hey.

49
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:18,683
IN RECOVERY

50
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:31,696
She had numerous femoral fractures,
so we operated on them.

51
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,197
The surgery was a success.

52
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,658
Thankfully, there's no brain hemorrhage.

53
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,451
But the problem is cerebral edema.

54
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,497
For now, we just have to wait
until the swelling goes down.

55
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:45,960
I'm sorry to say this,
but she's currently in a coma.

56
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,921
A coma?

57
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,674
When will she wake up? At what time?

58
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,175
She won't sleep forever, right?

59
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:56,470
We have no choice
but to administer medication and wait.

60
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,099
I'm afraid I can't tell you
how long it'll take.

61
00:10:00,808 --> 00:10:02,059
It could take a few days

62
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:04,895
or even years, although that's rare.

63
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,565
Her condition may not improve.

64
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,128
NAM HAE-E

65
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:35,801
Still nothing?

66
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,511
Right?

67
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,432
Damn it. I'm about to lose my mind.

68
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,312
Guys, if we don't hear from her
by lunchtime,

69
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:49,649
let's share this on social media,
ditch class, and go look for her.

70
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,234
Okay. I can get the hockey team
to give us a hand.

71
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,819
Good. Call everyone.

72
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:56,030
Sun-jae, you're coming too.

73
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,672
There are no announcements for today.

74
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:16,425
But Hae-e…

75
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,308
She was in a car accident.

76
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:26,477
She received an operation

77
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,854
and is in the ICU
at Ganghyeon University Hospital.

78
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:33,401
Please pray for her quick recovery--

79
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,902
Sun-jae.

80
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:35,820
Lee Sun-jae!

81
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:38,280
I'm sorry, Mr. Jeon.

82
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:03,347
Thank you.

83
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,057
Thank you.

84
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,310
It's quite spacious.

85
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:11,439
I've never been to a VIP room before.

86
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,899
You didn't need to.

87
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,360
They don't let people visit the ICU often.

88
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,779
But you're allowed to stay with her here.

89
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:23,576
She needs to hear your voice
if you want her to wake up soon.

90
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,287
Yes. This is the time to accept
your rich boyfriend's help.

91
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,038
Right, Jae-woo?

92
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:33,127
Yeong-ju, you should go to the store.

93
00:12:33,794 --> 00:12:36,839
I wish we could be away,
but we have too many regulars.

94
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:41,260
I definitely won't be as good as you,
but I'll do my best.

95
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,054
So don't worry about the store
and focus on Hae-e.

96
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,139
Thanks.

97
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,266
Jae-woo, go with her.

98
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,477
No, I'm staying here.

99
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,270
No.

100
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,899
I have Mr. Choi and the nurses,
but Yeong-ju will be alone.

101
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:55,816
Please?

102
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:00,196
You should go.

103
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,159
-Hae-e!
-Hae-e!

104
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,079
Why are you here?

105
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:12,333
School isn't even over yet,
so how are you guys here?

106
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,461
Ma'am, the anesthesia
hasn't worn off yet, right?

107
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,046
She'll wake up soon, right?

108
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,050
She's too impatient
to be lying down for too long.

109
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,927
She'll wake up soon.

110
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,473
She'll say, "Surprise!"

111
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,527
Hello.

112
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:41,153
Hello.

113
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,113
-Are you her mother?
-Yes.

114
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,907
We're from the Jungbu Police Station.

115
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,243
A suicide note?

116
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,954
Are you saying she jumped into the street?

117
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,665
Yes, we're afraid so.

118
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:54,583
We found

119
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,253
her suicide note on her phone.

120
00:13:57,336 --> 00:13:59,004
That's hers, right?

121
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,091
This can't be.

122
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,301
Hold on.
How could you conclude it as suicide

123
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,554
solely based on this memo?

124
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:09,640
The driver already gave us
their testimony.

125
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:10,724
And the dashcam

126
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,019
showed her running
in front of the car deliberately.

127
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:16,564
That's just ridiculous.
Why would she do such a thing?

128
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,984
Maybe it has something to do
with her turning in her exam blank.

129
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,445
You know how stressful
college admissions are for students.

130
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,874
GANGHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

131
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,863
Do you really think she did that
just because of one exam?

132
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,076
I just don't believe it.

133
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,039
That she submitted her exam blank
and attempted suicide.

134
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:18,709
But most importantly,

135
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,837
I had no idea about any of this.

136
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,966
I didn't know what she was going through

137
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,427
and was swept up
in being happy in a relationship.

138
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,015
It's because I'm not her real mom.

139
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,186
Don't beat yourself up.

140
00:15:38,479 --> 00:15:41,148
No one can read another person's mind,

141
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,442
no matter how close you are.

142
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,406
I should be the one to blame.

143
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,909
Come to think of it, that morning,

144
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,746
it seemed like she wanted
to tell me something.

145
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,499
I should've caught on to it.

146
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:03,963
What do you think she wanted to tell me?

147
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:11,303
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

148
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,810
Yeong-ju, what do you need me to do?

149
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,187
I'll go to the grocery store.

150
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:04,023
Can you write down a grocery list?

151
00:17:04,732 --> 00:17:07,359
Jae-woo, don't hold it in.

152
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:10,779
Your emotions. Let them out.

153
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:17,494
I know you've been holding back
your tears since you were at the hospital.

154
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,289
I know it was for Haeng-seon.

155
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,293
But she's not here right now,
so you can let your emotions out.

156
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:32,676
It was always me.

157
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:37,723
I was the one who always startled them.

158
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,894
I was the one they always had to look for.

159
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,397
And I was the one who was
always sick and bedridden.

160
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:50,611
And every time,
Haeng-seon and Hae-e kept me safe.

161
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,199
But seeing Hae-e…

162
00:17:57,159 --> 00:17:58,911
unconscious in bed…

163
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:02,956
makes me sad.

164
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:08,921
Despite being her uncle,

165
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:12,132
there's nothing I can do.

166
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,176
That's not true.

167
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,429
You're worried sick about her.

168
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:22,726
Cry if you want. It's okay.

169
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,187
I can actually keep a secret.

170
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:37,908
I'm sure Hae-e will understand.
She will wake up.

171
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,871
Let's believe that she will. Okay?

172
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:56,135
Don't worry.

173
00:18:56,969 --> 00:19:00,681
Sun-jae had good scores to begin with,
so no one will suspect him.

174
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,351
And no one can accuse him
since there's no proof.

175
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:12,359
Even if things go awry,
it won't affect you, ma'am.

176
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:15,070
I've told him to keep his mouth shut,

177
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:17,823
so please don't worry.

178
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,830
I'll call you back later. Goodbye.

179
00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:31,128
Sun-jae, what brings you to my office?

180
00:19:41,555 --> 00:19:43,015
What's the matter?

181
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,560
Mom.

182
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:50,522
It's our fault.

183
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,482
What?

184
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:54,484
Hae-e jumped in front of a moving car.

185
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:59,740
And it's all our fault!

186
00:20:06,997 --> 00:20:08,498
How is she?

187
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:09,791
She received surgery.

188
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,211
But she's still unconscious.

189
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:13,962
How badly is she hurt?

190
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,506
Will she wake up or not?

191
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,260
Why?

192
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:24,306
Do you wish she wouldn't wake up?

193
00:20:25,682 --> 00:20:26,767
Lee Sun-jae.

194
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,019
How could you say that?

195
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,984
Mom. Let's…

196
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,403
Let's just tell the school…

197
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,573
and take the punishment.

198
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,868
Doing that

199
00:20:45,744 --> 00:20:47,704
will help me face Hae-e when she wakes up.

200
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:50,999
Lee Sun-jae.

201
00:20:52,209 --> 00:20:54,461
Calm down and think rationally.

202
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,719
We're almost there.

203
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,554
One year…

204
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,681
No.

205
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:08,433
In six months,
you can get into your dream university.

206
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:09,893
Mom.

207
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,855
-Sun-jae.
-That's what you want, not what I want.

208
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,315
Yes, I want it!

209
00:21:15,816 --> 00:21:17,067
Because it's about your future.

210
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,486
You have no idea

211
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,823
how vulgar and critical our society is.

212
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,033
Your career is everything out there.

213
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:27,828
Sun-jae.

214
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,749
Sun-jae.

215
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,043
Hang in there. We're almost there.

216
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,423
So tell me.

217
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,719
Are you happy?

218
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,809
You have a great career.

219
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,814
So are you happy?

220
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,963
Why did you leave first?

221
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,216
We just said goodbye to Hae-e.

222
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,052
Reply if you read this.

223
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:20,482
Mr. Choi.

224
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:21,566
Hey.

225
00:23:24,194 --> 00:23:25,654
How's Hae-e?

226
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:29,407
They need to keep an eye on her.
Things aren't looking great.

227
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:31,284
I see.

228
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:35,372
Right, the academy called

229
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,457
about next week's math camp curriculum.

230
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,252
I forgot that I had
to speak with the director.

231
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,755
I organized and delivered the ideas
that came up during the meeting.

232
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:47,592
Someone would like to interview you
regarding the camp,

233
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:49,219
but we'll see what happens.

234
00:23:49,886 --> 00:23:53,473
Have they already announced the dates?
I'd like to push it back.

235
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,226
No, they haven't.

236
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,603
But I doubt we can
since we've already booked--

237
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:02,440
I wasn't up for it from the get-go.
I'm sick of putting on a show.

238
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,985
And I don't think I can focus
on the camp preparations.

239
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:07,904
Postpone it, or better yet,
cancel it if you can.

240
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:09,322
Please let the director know.

241
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,574
But sir…

242
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,200
Let's do that. Thanks.

243
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,128
Hello, Director Kang.

244
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:27,132
No, he's just a bit busy.

245
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:31,428
The math camp will go on as planned.

246
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:34,973
I'm afraid I'll be the only one attending
the curriculum meeting.

247
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:35,932
Okay.

248
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,110
I heard Hae-e attempted suicide.

249
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,995
How frightening.

250
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,999
Then again, it's par for the course
in this neighborhood.

251
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,669
She looked pretty strong on the outside,

252
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,755
but I guess that wasn't the case.

253
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,341
It wasn't even the CSAT,

254
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,301
but one midterm exam--

255
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:12,969
That's enough!

256
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,724
That could've been me.

257
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:21,102
That could've been me!

258
00:25:27,734 --> 00:25:29,986
This one is too easy
to be a killer question.

259
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:32,614
But the students could be confused
if we omit it.

260
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,616
How about we move up the latter questions?

261
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:37,410
-Mr. Ji, can you take a look at this?
-That could work.

262
00:25:37,494 --> 00:25:40,121
-I'll be back.
-It's the presentation you asked for.

263
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,208
-This…
-Can you switch the top and bottom ones?

264
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,252
-The top and bottom?
-Yes.

265
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,045
Mr. Ji, for the merchandise,

266
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,547
we have a copy of Mr. Choi's notes,
a stopwatch, and--

267
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,050
-Which one had the highest demand?
-The first one.

268
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:54,177
Then let's go with this one
for the Golden Bell merch.

269
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,471
-Okay.
-Here's the draft of the questions.

270
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,308
Okay. This looks good.

271
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,185
Let's see what Mr. Choi says.

272
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,520
-Okay.
-Okay.

273
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,731
-I'll be back.
-Okay.

274
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:09,985
Hello, Mr. Choi.

275
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,570
Did you speak with the director yet
about the math camp?

276
00:26:14,447 --> 00:26:18,576
Well, I did. But he wouldn't budge.

277
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,289
He said the venue was already booked.

278
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:26,251
He was adamant about having
your comeback event.

279
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:28,086
Is that so?

280
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,382
You can leave the preparations up to me

281
00:26:32,465 --> 00:26:34,175
and just give the final confirmation.

282
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:37,637
Doing this will benefit you.

283
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,180
This is a crucial time for you.

284
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,017
Fine. It can't be helped then.

285
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:46,563
Okay. Are you at the hospital?

286
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:47,897
No, I got kicked out.

287
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:50,066
Haeng-seon said she can't sleep
with me around.

288
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,901
I'm going to go back tomorrow morning.

289
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,196
Get some sleep, or you'll get sick.

290
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,033
Okay, thanks. I'll leave you to it.

291
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,117
See you tomorrow.

292
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:43,620
CONTACTS

293
00:27:56,091 --> 00:28:00,261
HUI-JAE'S DAD

294
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,471
CALL

295
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,104
What is it?

296
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,647
You picked up.

297
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,400
I didn't think you would.

298
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:15,652
Are you drunk?

299
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,029
Why did you call?

300
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:19,948
"Why"?

301
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:25,412
Why did I call?

302
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,291
I'm not sure.

303
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:36,131
I just wanted to talk to someone.

304
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:42,178
But I had no one to call, so I called you.

305
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:48,935
My life is so boring, isn't it?

306
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:50,603
You're drunk.

307
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:53,314
-Go to bed.
-Honey.

308
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,069
How did I end up like this?

309
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,033
How did I end up like this?

310
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,830
I'm scared of what I've become.

311
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:12,792
How far will I go?
How much worse will I become?

312
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:16,880
Do you know
what went through my mind earlier?

313
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,260
"I hope she just dies."

314
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,013
"That would be better."

315
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,097
What do you mean?

316
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:28,224
Who's "she"?

317
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:30,894
Hello?

318
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,937
Jang Seo-jin.

319
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,376
Hey.

320
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:58,004
Consider yourself lucky.

321
00:29:58,755 --> 00:30:01,257
You're getting a massage
from a former national athlete.

322
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,471
I still don't understand, Hae-e.

323
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,891
Is it true?

324
00:30:13,269 --> 00:30:14,562
Did you really run into…

325
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,316
What is this?

326
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,716
The weather is lovely today, Su-a.

327
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,761
Study hard.

328
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:52,016
Get some sunlight and take a walk
every now and then. Okay?

329
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,269
There's a nice walking trail
behind the school.

330
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,272
Okay?

331
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,775
All right, have a good day.

332
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:02,318
Good luck, Su-a!

333
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:26,175
Hey, it's been a long time.

334
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,973
I've been meaning to call you sooner,

335
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:35,143
but I've been busy
helping my daughter prepare for college.

336
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,813
How's your clinic doing?

337
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,025
I called…

338
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,321
because of my daughter.

339
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:52,493
I think she has

340
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:56,331
stress-related anger management issues
due to college admissions.

341
00:31:57,248 --> 00:32:00,919
It's a common symptom found
among students preparing for college.

342
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:03,296
They're violent and compulsive.

343
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,091
In serious cases,
they hear and see things as well.

344
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:10,136
Keep a good eye on her
and see what her symptoms are like.

345
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:29,656
All right.

346
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,241
I have your midterm results.

347
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:36,079
Come up when I call your name.

348
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,831
If you have any issues,
talk to your teachers.

349
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:41,668
-Ko So-yeong.
-Yes.

350
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:50,343
MATH
SCORE: 68, LEVEL: 4

351
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:06,401
Hey, I overheard something
in the teachers' office.

352
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,111
Hae-e got the lowest midterm score.

353
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,487
Her Reading exam was blank.

354
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,613
Seriously?

355
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,408
-Why?
-Beats me.

356
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,535
Maybe she was rebelling
against her fake mom.

357
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,912
Do you think the accident--

358
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,457
What is this nonsense?

359
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,084
Hey.

360
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,795
What are you guys yapping about?

361
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,798
If I hear you gossiping about
things you don't know about again,

362
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:30,967
I'll crush you.

363
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,387
-We were just…
-We're only talking.

364
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:02,123
The driver already gave us
their testimony.

365
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,207
And the dashcam

366
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,419
showed her running
in front the car deliberately.

367
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,046
I overheard something
in the teachers' office.

368
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,756
Hae-e got the lowest midterm score.

369
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,090
Her Reading exam was blank.

370
00:34:11,966 --> 00:34:14,469
Sun-jae, you can't avoid this forever.

371
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:18,431
The exam was exactly the same
as the material you gave me.

372
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,515
It's…

373
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,442
Lee Sun-jae!

374
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,946
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

375
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,411
Hey! Do you really want to kill yourself?

376
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,331
Yes, I do.

377
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:45,708
So just leave me alone!

378
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,043
Get lost!

379
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:49,796
Hey!

380
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:56,010
Snap out of it, you bastard.

381
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:02,016
Snap out of it.

382
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:13,069
Hey.

383
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,570
That's enough!

384
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,074
Let go of me!

385
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:21,160
Let go…

386
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:28,584
It says only one student is absent,
so why are there three empty seats?

387
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,585
Who isn't here?

388
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,630
Whose seats are those?

389
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:37,718
I missed another class.

390
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,054
I was really determined to study.

391
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:43,015
This is exactly why…

392
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,645
my mom told me
to choose my friends wisely.

393
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:54,360
Was that funny?

394
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,991
You're an idiot.

395
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:20,636
What is it?

396
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,556
What's with you and Hae-e?

397
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,099
Does this have something to do…

398
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,227
with how awkward you guys were?

399
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,528
You're so frustrating.

400
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,866
I don't know what this is about.

401
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,620
But just face it head-on. Don't avoid it.

402
00:36:46,913 --> 00:36:48,706
Imagine if Hae-e saw you like this.

403
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:51,125
Do you think she'd want to wake up?

404
00:36:52,001 --> 00:36:52,835
Do you?

405
00:37:12,021 --> 00:37:13,022
Where are you going?

406
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:23,991
Sir…

407
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:25,493
Mr. Jeon.

408
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,702
Hey, Sun-jae.

409
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:28,746
What is it?

410
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,790
Well, you see…

411
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,295
I have something to tell you.

412
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:39,674
So what exactly do you want to tell us?

413
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,843
It just doesn't sit right with me.

414
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,137
About the so-called suicide note…

415
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,181
This isn't how she normally talks.

416
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,101
She addresses her uncle as just "Uncle,"
not "Uncle Jae-woo."

417
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,978
She also doesn't use that many periods.

418
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,230
She's always very brief with her words.

419
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:56,899
-Kids these days are unpredictable--
-The trash bag.

420
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,402
The store employee said
she bought one that day.

421
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:02,613
That's not something
a suicidal girl would do.

422
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,699
I also found something odd

423
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,575
-on her palm--
-Ma'am.

424
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,203
I mean, Hae-e's Auntie.

425
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:12,248
It turns out you are her aunt,
not her mother.

426
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:16,043
And you made her run errands
on a regular basis.

427
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,880
I heard she delivered food
to your customers.

428
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:22,174
She only did that when I was too busy--

429
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,177
Beating and swearing
aren't the only means of abuse.

430
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:27,513
When kids
from problematic families run away

431
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:30,933
and we painstakingly find them,

432
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:35,354
they always beg us
not to send them back home.

433
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,981
"Abuse"?

434
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,568
Watch what you say.

435
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:50,036
Have you ever seen her family before?

436
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:54,498
You're generalizing this case
based on a few prior cases.

437
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,586
You shouldn't do that.

438
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,172
You're a cop, for goodness' sake.

439
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:03,924
Come on. I wasn't accusing her of that--

440
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,969
I don't mind.
You can misunderstand me all you want.

441
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:08,929
Just please reinvestigate.

442
00:39:10,014 --> 00:39:12,099
I really don't think
she attempted suicide.

443
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:16,520
Why would she have this on her palm?

444
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,022
What could this be?

445
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,441
Could it be paint?

446
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:23,486
No, it's not.
I couldn't get it off with wet wipes.

447
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:28,074
It's brownish orange.

448
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,492
I thought it was from a pen,

449
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:32,828
so I told Jae-woo to bring
all the pens from home this morning.

450
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,413
But none of them were this color.

451
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:38,376
-So this appeared after she went missing?
-Probably.

452
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,294
None of this makes sense.

453
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,130
Going missing after buying a trash bag,
a car accident in another neighborhood,

454
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:44,590
and that weird suicide note.

455
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,175
Everything is just too odd.

456
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:56,894
One minute.

457
00:40:14,995 --> 00:40:16,372
Hello, Director Kang.

458
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:20,418
Mr. Choi, I called to ask you
for a favor regarding the math camp.

459
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,711
Could we accept 100 more students?

460
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,005
The parents have been calling nonstop.

461
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:28,259
Before that, I was meaning to call you
about something.

462
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,302
What? What for?

463
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:34,014
I know Mr. Ji asked you
to delay the math camp.

464
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,517
I don't think
this is the right time for me.

465
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:40,604
I know it's already been announced,
and booking a new venue won't be easy…

466
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,690
Hold on. What delay?

467
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:45,067
This is news to me.

468
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,652
You want to push back the date?

469
00:40:48,028 --> 00:40:50,406
Didn't Mr. Ji tell you about this?

470
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:51,824
No, he didn't.

471
00:40:52,658 --> 00:40:55,744
But it's too late
since we announced it today.

472
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,583
The next one

473
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:04,295
is a geometry problem
that many students struggle with.

474
00:41:04,378 --> 00:41:06,797
It has been spotted regularly

475
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:09,425
in the June and September mocks
as well as the CSAT.

476
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,968
So make sure you review it.

477
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,721
Now, let's move on to sequences.

478
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:14,680
That's enough.

479
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,266
How many staff members
do you need for the Golden Bell?

480
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,601
We need to know in advance.

481
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:20,311
We need four staff members

482
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:22,563
and two more for the boards.

483
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:25,649
Sure. Please make sure Mr. Choi
shows up for the final rehearsal.

484
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,984
Yes, he will.

485
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:29,528
Here.

486
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,076
Hello, Mr. Choi.

487
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:37,661
Where are you?

488
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:39,455
I'm doing the first rehearsal…

489
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:42,791
What's wrong?

490
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:46,879
Were you always like this?

491
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,341
You never talked to the academy,

492
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,552
yet you lied through your teeth.

493
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:55,596
Have you always been like this?

494
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,767
Slyly controlling my role
in the academy as you want?

495
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,852
I would never.

496
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,813
I just knew they wouldn't understand--

497
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,148
Who are you to assume that?

498
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:10,152
I never wanted to do
this math camp from the get-go,

499
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:11,320
yet you encouraged it.

500
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,448
And now you've lied to my face.

501
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:15,991
You crossed the line.

502
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,493
You deceived me, you know that?

503
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:19,912
You're right.

504
00:42:20,496 --> 00:42:22,122
I apologize for lying to you.

505
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:23,958
But I did it for you.

506
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,626
How so?

507
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,964
This is a huge event.

508
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,132
Changing the date due to personal reasons

509
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,759
will only kill your credibility.

510
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,135
This comeback wasn't easy.

511
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:39,348
I couldn't let you ruin your reputation.

512
00:42:40,641 --> 00:42:43,852
Don't try to justify your actions.
You thought I was a joke--

513
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:44,937
That's not true.

514
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,110
I didn't want you to become a joke.

515
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:55,906
What?

516
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,951
You were never like this.

517
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,454
You'd starve for days
and receive IV drips just to teach.

518
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,416
You always worked endlessly
without taking a break.

519
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:07,251
You were always professional

520
00:43:07,334 --> 00:43:09,878
and never let your private matters
affect your work.

521
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:13,632
But you were swayed by Ms. Nam
and kept making exceptions.

522
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:18,512
Seeing you like that
flustered and upset me.

523
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:21,932
I'm not being swayed.

524
00:43:23,017 --> 00:43:24,310
I'm changing.

525
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:30,816
Did you think I was normal back then?

526
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,652
They'd call me the Trillion Won Man,

527
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:36,864
yet I was empty inside,
slaving away at work.

528
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:40,909
I couldn't even digest my food and would
return to my empty shell of a house.

529
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,953
I'd toss and turn in bed, trying to sleep,

530
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,955
then repeat everything again and again.

531
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,625
You think that's who I really am?

532
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,001
You miss the old me?

533
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,670
I don't.

534
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,177
But this change won't benefit you.

535
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:01,013
Who are you to determine
whether it benefits me or not?

536
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,140
-Mr. Choi!
-That's up to me to decide!

537
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:06,810
I decide my future in this line of work
and what I value in life!

538
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:12,274
As of now, Haeng-seon and her family
matter just as much as my work.

539
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,569
So don't complain.

540
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,906
What's so great about her?

541
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,075
It's not like her kid died or anything!

542
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:31,794
What?

543
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,343
What did you say?

544
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:42,137
How could you…

545
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:45,641
Mr. Choi, what I meant was--

546
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:47,935
I guess I never really knew you.

547
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,941
If that's what you think,

548
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:57,486
then I can't work with you anymore.

549
00:45:01,949 --> 00:45:03,117
This is the end for us.

550
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:38,610
Mr. Ji, I don't think this is right.

551
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,320
In his burst of anger…

552
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,282
Come on. You guys have a long history.

553
00:45:43,365 --> 00:45:46,952
You've been working together for years.
You're like family.

554
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:50,456
Maybe just give him some time
to cool down…

555
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,083
Mr. Ji.

556
00:45:59,548 --> 00:46:00,757
Is this really happening?

557
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,093
He quit just like that?

558
00:46:03,177 --> 00:46:05,846
Maybe it's just a lover's quarrel.

559
00:46:06,555 --> 00:46:07,806
I don't know anymore.

560
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,977
Judging by what I just saw,
they're pretty much getting a divorce.

561
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,419
Hello?

562
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:40,672
Hello, this is Detective Bae Jeong-su
from Ganghyeon Police Station.

563
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,049
Hello.

564
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:45,010
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about Mr. Jin I-sang.

565
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,887
Are you free right now?

566
00:46:48,764 --> 00:46:50,933
Yes, that's correct.

567
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:55,145
That was around the time
when I found out that he was Chiyeolsucks.

568
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:58,106
Why didn't you report him to the police?

569
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,442
I didn't see the need to go that far.

570
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,153
And he promised that he'd stop.

571
00:47:07,616 --> 00:47:09,284
What are you doing?

572
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:12,204
Are you suspecting me?
I have a solid alibi.

573
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:15,249
Right.

574
00:47:16,583 --> 00:47:18,377
This may be offensive to hear.

575
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:20,671
But I'll be honest.

576
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:24,841
All these metal ball cases
have only one thing in common.

577
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,052
It's you.

578
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:31,306
You were at Nation's Best Banchan
when a metal ball was shot.

579
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:34,518
Lee Young-min stormed out of your class
right before he died.

580
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,479
And in Jin I-sang's last call
to his friend,

581
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:40,857
he said you had found out
that he was Chiyeolsucks

582
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:42,526
and that he was going to lie low.

583
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,612
I'm sorry, but may I look at your hands?

584
00:48:01,837 --> 00:48:03,171
What are you doing?

585
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,971
There's a witness in Mr. Jin's case.

586
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,515
According to the witness,

587
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:16,685
the joint of the suspect's
right index finger

588
00:48:16,768 --> 00:48:18,270
was calloused.

589
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,187
"Calloused"?

590
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:24,526
The callus must have formed
from repeatedly pulling a slingshot.

591
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,862
That's what we assume.

592
00:48:29,573 --> 00:48:30,907
They would've pulled it back

593
00:48:32,284 --> 00:48:33,493
like so.

594
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:45,797
INTERROGATION RECORDING ROOM A

595
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:46,923
Mr. Choi.

596
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,760
Yes?

597
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,679
This is a personal question.

598
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:55,599
Do you happen to know a Jeong Seong-hyeon?

599
00:48:57,184 --> 00:48:58,644
"Jeong Seong-hyeon"?

600
00:48:58,727 --> 00:48:59,686
I'm afraid I don't.

601
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,480
Then how about…

602
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,732
Jeong Su-hyeon?

603
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:04,816
Su-hyeon…

604
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:07,903
Jeong Su-hyeon?

605
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,914
After what I've done for you!

606
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,026
He's the only person I can trust.

607
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,696
He's the only one I consider an adult.

608
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,406
Should I confide in Mr. Choi?

609
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,117
I thought the same way, Su-hyeon.

610
00:49:57,494 --> 00:50:01,373
I wanted to protect
the only trustworthy adult we had.

611
00:50:04,584 --> 00:50:06,712
But he abandoned me.

612
00:50:08,213 --> 00:50:09,965
And he forgot about you too.

613
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,642
JEONG SU-HYEON

614
00:50:20,726 --> 00:50:23,437
-Please, Mom.
-Don't you dare call me your mom!

615
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,314
Am I really your mom?
Then why did you tell the school,

616
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:28,275
"My mom got hold of the exam paper,

617
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,235
so please punish her"?

618
00:50:30,318 --> 00:50:32,571
-Mom--
-How could you do this to me?

619
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:34,948
It was all for your sake!

620
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,232
Su-hyeon.

621
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,193
Su-hyeon!

622
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,329
Su-hyeon…

623
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,292
Go home.

624
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,211
You have exams next week.

625
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,754
Can I just…

626
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:15,841
stay here?

627
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:34,985
OUR DEEPEST CONDOLENCES
JEONSIN FOREIGN LANGUAGE HIGH SCHOOL

628
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,571
What's this rumor
about the exam questions leaking?

629
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:40,407
Before Su-hyeon died,

630
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:42,951
she told her school

631
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:45,412
about the exam questions getting leaked.

632
00:52:46,788 --> 00:52:49,082
The principal just swept it under the rug,

633
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,918
but all the students found out.

634
00:52:53,753 --> 00:52:54,921
Tell me about it.

635
00:52:57,048 --> 00:52:58,049
Sir.

636
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:03,763
You're Mr. Choi Chi-yeol.

637
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,682
Right?

638
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:08,518
Yes.

639
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:14,774
Su-hyeon told me a lot about you.

640
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,777
She also said she took your pen.

641
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:22,032
I gave it to her.

642
00:53:23,116 --> 00:53:24,200
So it's hers.

643
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:53,521
Mom.

644
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,357
How could you sleep
when the exam is in two days?

645
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,233
Don't you know you're my only hope now?

646
00:53:57,317 --> 00:53:59,277
I know. I was just so sleepy--

647
00:53:59,361 --> 00:54:00,654
You should've fought it!

648
00:54:01,237 --> 00:54:03,323
How will you get into a top school
with such a weak mentality?

649
00:54:04,616 --> 00:54:06,534
Come out.

650
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:08,286
-Mom…
-You're sleepy? Then wake up.

651
00:54:08,370 --> 00:54:10,538
-Mom…
-Come out! Go!

652
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,667
Mom, I won't sleep.

653
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:15,251
It's so cold. Please let me in.

654
00:54:15,335 --> 00:54:18,546
Mom! Please open the door.

655
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,423
Mom!

656
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:31,559
I can't believe you fell asleep again.

657
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:33,687
Get up.

658
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:35,772
Go study if you're awake now.

659
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,292
There's no decisive evidence

660
00:54:56,376 --> 00:55:00,171
that the defendant intended
to murder his mother.

661
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:03,425
Furthermore, there's a possibility

662
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:07,846
that the mother decided to end her life
over the loss of her daughter.

663
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,306
As for his charge of matricide,

664
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:14,019
I find the defendant innocent.

665
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:25,488
DEFENDANT

666
00:55:35,623 --> 00:55:39,461

IDENTIFICATION CARD
JI DONG-HUI

668
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:24,005
NAME: JI DONG-HUI
FATHER: JI DONG-SU, DECEASED

669
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:25,715
I'm Kim Su-hyeon.

670
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:26,800
It's nice to meet you.

671
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,301
I'm Kim Bo-ra.

672
00:56:28,384 --> 00:56:29,385
I hope we get along.

673
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,346
I'm Shin Ji-hye.

674
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:34,015
I'm so delighted to be
your teaching assistant.

675
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,850
I hope those feelings don't change.

676
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,394
What's your name?

677
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,313
I'm Ji Dong-hui.

678
00:56:40,396 --> 00:56:41,731
It's an honor to serve you.

679
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:43,775
"Serve me"? I'm not a king.

680
00:56:44,442 --> 00:56:45,443
I hope we get along.

681
00:56:53,952 --> 00:56:55,370
-Can you let go?
-Right.

682
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,913
-Your name?
-Kwon Yun-hyeong.

683
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:57,956
-Kwon Yun-hyeong?
-Yes.

684
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,457
-I hope we get along.
-Likewise.

685
00:57:07,006 --> 00:57:08,007
Mr. Choi.

686
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,134
Thank you.

687
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:13,138
I used to have the same exact pen.

688
00:57:13,221 --> 00:57:16,307
Really? My sister gave me that.

689
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:20,103
How fascinating.
Not many people use this brand.

690
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,721
Do you happen to know a Jeong Seong-hyeon?

691
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,057
Then how about…

692
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,059
Jeong Su-hyeon?

693
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:12,280
MATH
JI DONG-HUI

694
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:43,061
Hey, this won't do.

695
00:58:44,646 --> 00:58:46,314
We need a few more side dishes.

696
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:48,650
Our trays look too empty.

697
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:51,736
We need to maintain our sales
even when Haeng-seon isn't here.

698
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,448
Then should I buy more groceries?

699
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:56,699
Yes.

700
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,409
But first, let's wipe this.

701
00:59:06,918 --> 00:59:08,628
We're not open yet.

702
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:12,757
Are you a celebrity?

703
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,641
It's not as spacious as I thought.
It looked big from the outside.

704
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:25,687
But the rent must be expensive.

705
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:29,315
Judging by its location, I bet it is.

706
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,027
How much do you make?

707
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:36,656
What is your monthly net profit?

708
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:40,535
Are you thinking about
opening up a store nearby?

709
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:41,661
Me?

710
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,956
Do I look like I would?

711
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,006
By the way, did Haeng-seon go somewhere?

712
00:59:53,089 --> 00:59:54,215
I don't see her.

713
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,676
Does Hae-e not come here that often?

714
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,096
Are you Haeng-seon's friend?
What's your name?

715
01:00:07,186 --> 01:00:08,313
Sister.

716
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:10,607
Nam Haeng-ja.

717
01:00:13,318 --> 01:00:14,319
Jae-woo.

718
01:00:15,987 --> 01:00:22,493
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

719
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:25,371
Hae-e…

720
01:00:25,872 --> 01:00:27,624
Open your eyes, will you?

721
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,293
It's me, your mom.

722
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,712
Hae-e!

723
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:43,640
What's going on?

724
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:46,476
Where have you been all this time?

725
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:49,145
I was in Japan all this time
and flew here. So what?

726
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:51,356
How could you be so irresponsible?

727
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:55,318
Why is my daughter
unconscious and hospitalized?

728
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,239
Hae-e, your mom is here…

729
01:01:03,451 --> 01:01:06,954
Didn't you miss me a lot, my dear baby?

730
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:09,916
She was bombarding me with questions.

731
01:01:09,999 --> 01:01:11,501
I had to tell her.

732
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,045
No…

733
01:01:19,467 --> 01:01:20,468
Hae-e…

734
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:31,979
Open your eyes.

735
01:01:34,565 --> 01:01:36,275
My poor baby.

736
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,740
Drink this and refresh yourself.

737
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,245
I mean,

738
01:01:47,328 --> 01:01:49,455
how could two sisters be so different?

739
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,336
Does Hae-e take after you
more than her mom?

740
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:57,714
It's neither.

741
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,049
Maybe it's her dad.

742
01:02:00,591 --> 01:02:03,594
I don't know. My head hurts.

743
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,974
How could she just show up now
and be so shameless?

744
01:02:08,474 --> 01:02:10,935
There must be a reason why she came now.

745
01:02:11,853 --> 01:02:13,146
Who knows?

746
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,189
Maybe she could help Hae-e
recover quickly.

747
01:02:15,940 --> 01:02:17,150
I'm not sure.

748
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:19,360
Do you think so?

749
01:02:23,531 --> 01:02:25,575
-What's with your face?
-What?

750
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,619
You look haggard. Is something going on?

751
01:02:30,621 --> 01:02:32,582
No, everything's fine.

752
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:34,542
You're obviously lying.

753
01:02:35,626 --> 01:02:37,378
You don't look too well.

754
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:39,797
Tell me.

755
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:53,019
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

756
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:54,103
It's nothing.

757
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,231
After being acquitted of his charges,

758
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,275
he never left his house.

759
01:02:59,358 --> 01:03:00,777
And I never saw him again.

760
01:03:02,111 --> 01:03:05,156
A few years later,
someone moved into that house.

761
01:03:05,239 --> 01:03:09,994
It turned out that his uncle
reported him missing and moved in.

762
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,915
-Does the uncle still live here?
-He sold it and moved out.

763
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,001
It's been well over five years.

764
01:03:19,170 --> 01:03:22,548
I know it's wrong of me to say this,

765
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:26,385
but missing or not,
I was glad that kid disappeared.

766
01:03:26,886 --> 01:03:30,097
He'd shoot metal balls all the time
and put me in a pickle.

767
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:33,601
-"Metal balls"?
-Yes.

768
01:03:33,684 --> 01:03:37,605
The residents would complain
about someone shooting metal balls.

769
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:39,106
It drove me crazy.

770
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,567
Turns out he was the culprit.

771
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:43,402
I only found out later.

772
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:47,323
Looking back,

773
01:03:48,616 --> 01:03:50,952
none of his family members were sane.

774
01:03:57,333 --> 01:04:00,002
-Come on.
-You're truly incredible.

775
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:03,714
Another firm had given up on the case,
saying it was impossible.

776
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:06,217
But you won,
and at the Supreme Court at that.

777
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:09,387
I was just lucky.

778
01:04:09,470 --> 01:04:12,515
Come on. Everyone in this line of work
knows how competent you are.

779
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:13,516
Congratulations.

780
01:04:14,058 --> 01:04:14,892
Thanks.

781
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,979
Shouldn't we celebrate this over dinner?

782
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:20,773
Sure. Then let's have dinner…

783
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,567
Excuse me.

784
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:39,375
Hello?

785
01:04:39,458 --> 01:04:42,044
Hello, Ms. Jang.
This is Sun-jae's homeroom teacher.

786
01:04:43,337 --> 01:04:45,089
How have you been?

787
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:48,509
May I ask what you're calling about?

788
01:04:49,427 --> 01:04:52,805
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
you need to visit the school.

789
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:01,647
DUE TO AN UNFORTUNATE INCIDENT,
THE MIDTERM RESULTS HAVE BEEN UPDATED

790
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,151
WOORIM HIGH SCHOOL BULLETIN BOARD

791
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:07,653
What? Wasn't Sun-jae in first place?

792
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,530
He's not even in the top 30.

793
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,657
No one from Class 1 is on the list.

794
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:15,578
This must mean the "unfortunate incident"
has something to do with Sun-jae.

795
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:16,704
Maybe he cheated.

796
01:05:28,633 --> 01:05:31,052
-Something's going on, right?
-Yes.

797
01:05:33,846 --> 01:05:36,182
Hey, it's me. I was just about to leave.

798
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:41,896
What do you mean?

799
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,607
Someone leaked the midterm exam?

800
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:51,322
The education director?
Who did she leak it to?

801
01:05:51,405 --> 01:05:52,406
This way, please.

802
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:55,660
-Hello?
-Hello?

803
01:05:56,577 --> 01:05:58,329
-What?
-What?

804
01:05:59,455 --> 01:06:01,332
-Hello?
-What do you mean?

805
01:06:01,415 --> 01:06:02,833
-So what happened?
-"Leaked"?

806
01:06:11,884 --> 01:06:13,844

It's me, Sun-jae.

Please help Mom.

813

Do you want something to drink?

814
01:07:28,794 --> 01:07:30,504
I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.

815
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,384
I overreacted.

816
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:39,889
You always took my words
into consideration,

817
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:43,934
consulted me often, and treated me well.

01:07:45,269 --> 01:07:48,064
So I think I felt entitled
and crossed the line.

819
01:07:49,190 --> 01:07:51,400
I'm sorry.
I really shouldn't have done that.

820
01:07:52,818 --> 01:07:55,613
This job means nothing
if I'm not working with you.

821
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,198
I have no reason to do this.

822
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,785
I will never cross the line again.

823
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,245
Please give me the chance…

824
01:08:04,622 --> 01:08:05,956
to serve you again.

825
01:08:08,667 --> 01:08:09,502
Get up.

826
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:14,131
-Mr. Choi.
-Get up, Dong-hui.

827
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:28,104
I…

828
01:08:36,487 --> 01:08:38,989
I overreacted as well yesterday.

829
01:08:40,157 --> 01:08:41,659
I was too sensitive.

830
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:44,620
I shouldn't have treated you like that

831
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:47,998
when you've stood by me
and dedicated yourself to me

832
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:49,750
for the past six years.

833
01:08:51,836 --> 01:08:52,670
Mr. Choi.

834
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:55,214
Let's forget what happened yesterday

835
01:08:55,714 --> 01:08:57,174
and start anew.

836
01:09:20,364 --> 01:09:21,657
I'll see you tomorrow.

837
01:10:40,736 --> 01:10:41,737
Take a look at this.

838
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:47,826
Doesn't it look similar
to the stain on Hae-e's palm?

839
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:52,081
Yes, I think so.

840
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:55,042
There's a fountain pen
that Mr. Ji always uses.

841
01:10:55,834 --> 01:10:58,295
It could've been that ink.

842
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:02,591
When you first mentioned Dong-hui to me,

843
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:06,428
I honestly thought
there was a misunderstanding.

844
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:09,306
But I don't know anymore…

845
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,059
about what kind of person he is

846
01:11:13,394 --> 01:11:14,853
or why he's by my side.

847
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:24,863
Okay.

848
01:11:33,872 --> 01:11:35,332
According to the witness,

849
01:11:35,916 --> 01:11:38,585
the joint of the suspect's
right index finger

850
01:11:38,669 --> 01:11:40,796
was calloused.

851
01:12:56,163 --> 01:13:01,168
