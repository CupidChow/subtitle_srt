00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,854
LET'S GO!
HERE WE GO!

3
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:05,482
Mr. Choi, it's nice to meet you in person.

4
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:08,109
-You're so handsome. Incredible.
-Who are you?

5
00:01:08,193 --> 00:01:09,027
Hold on.

6
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,111
IT'S THE CHEATER!
IT'S OKAY, MR. CHOI!

7
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:12,989
I'm Mr. Popular,
delivering hot news faster than anyone.

8
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,158
Welcome to Mr. Popular's World.

9
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:17,118
IS HE CRAZY?
GO, MR. POPULAR!

10
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:18,286
Mr. Popular?

11
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,330
Guys,

12
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,165
Mr. Choi knows me.

13
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,709
That'll be enough. Thank you.

14
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,799
Is it true that you
no longer work at The Pride?

15
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,134
How does it feel to hit rock bottom?

16
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:34,260
Just leave!

17
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:36,888
You can't seem to answer me.
Then next question.

18
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,474
How do you feel about her now?

19
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:40,558
Are you still in love?

20
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,394
How do you feel about being
the center of a cheating scandal?

21
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,437
It's not a scandal!

22
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,105
I KNOW HER!
WHAT?

23
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,941
WHO IS SHE?
FROM WOORIM HIGH!

24
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,108
What do you mean?

25
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,193
WOW
SHE'S PRETTY

26
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,361
SHE'S MY TYPE
ANYONE HAVE HER NUMBER?

27
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:52,612
It's not a scandal.

28
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,906
Hae-e.

29
00:01:56,825 --> 00:01:58,159
Because my mom…

30
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:01,371
isn't actually

31
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,456
my mom.

32
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,711
She's my aunt, and she's single.

33
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:10,672
MIND BLOWN
WHAT IS SHE SAYING?

34
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,465
So this isn't a scandal.

35
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,424
WHAT?
WHAT THE HECK?

36
00:02:13,508 --> 00:02:14,509
It's just a romance.

37
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,010
WHAT DID SHE SAY?
SERIOUSLY?

38
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,770
That's his academy building, right?

39
00:02:25,854 --> 00:02:26,896
Yes, I think so.

40
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,106
Haeng-seon.

41
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,149
Hey!

42
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,403
This is such a huge mess.

43
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,990
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

44
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:39,701
UNBELIEVABLE
WHERE'S HER MOM?

45
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,202
NO WAY
MR. POPULAR GOT THE SCOOP

46
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,996
Wait.

47
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:46,166
That's mine.

48
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:52,463
-Leave. I said leave!
-My viewers have a right to know.

49
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:54,841
She's your aunt?

50
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:56,092
Mr. Choi!

51
00:02:57,677 --> 00:03:00,096
Mr. Choi! Adultery! Aunt?

52
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,603
So…

53
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,440
Ms. Nam isn't your mom…

54
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:13,526
but your aunt?

55
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,199
She lied for my sake.

56
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,285
To protect me.

57
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,371
My mom…

58
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,291
I mean, my aunt

59
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,210
has never been married.

60
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,381
And she likes you a lot.

61
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,678
You like her too. Right?

62
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:26,683
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

63
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,234
Nam Hae-e, you…

64
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,654
Why did you do that?
Why are you even here?

65
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:41,197
What for?

66
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,827
Because…

67
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,746
I have a conscience.

68
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,917
All this is a problem
because they think you're my mom.

69
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:55,086
From this ridiculous scandal

70
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,380
to your and Mr. Choi's feelings--

71
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:00,174
Why should you care?
This is a matter for grown-ups.

72
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:02,135
-You focus on your studies--
-No, I can't.

73
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,097
I want to stop being shameless.

74
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,852
Auntie, I want you…

75
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,856
to live your own life from now on.

76
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,570
Express your feelings to the man you like.

77
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,740
And go on dates with him.

78
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:31,205
I should've done this sooner.

79
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:36,878
I'm sorry it took me so long.

80
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,217
I'm really sorry.

81
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,386
Why would you be, you brat?

82
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:48,139
I wasn't forced to do this.

83
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,433
I chose this life because
I felt better that way.

84
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,436
I needed a reason to stay strong.

85
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,645
And to me,

86
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,608
-you and Jae-woo--
-I know that.

87
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,319
But you've done enough.

88
00:06:04,697 --> 00:06:06,032
You like Mr. Choi, don't you?

89
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,409
He likes you a lot too.

90
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,454
He was watching you work
for a while earlier today.

91
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:18,711
So don't let him go.

92
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,422
I like him too.

93
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:47,281
THE FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIP OF OUR LOVE

94
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,535
EPISODE 11

95
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:04,298
-Hey, Chi-yeol.
-Where's your sister?

96
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,716
Where's Ms. Nam?

97
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,136
She stepped out a while ago after seeing

98
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:10,847
the live stream of Mr. Popular
or Mr. Poopular or whatever.

99
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,809
But she forgot to take her phone.

100
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,939
Mr. Choi.

101
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,525
Can I have a word with you?

102
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:26,946
Jae-woo, will you excuse us for a minute?

103
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:37,957
So she's lived as Hae-e's mom
for more than a decade now.

104
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:43,754
Sometimes, I feel admiration for her.

105
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,177
But other times,
I feel frustrated as her friend

106
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,971
by all the sacrifices she makes.

107
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,602
But they seem to rely on each other a lot.

108
00:07:57,685 --> 00:07:58,603
As a family.

109
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,939
The three of them are very tight-knit.

110
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:06,944
That must be why
she couldn't tell you the truth.

111
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:11,782
Hae-e got really hurt once
back in middle school.

112
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:16,996
Mr. Choi.

113
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,791
Haeng-seon

114
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:23,377
is an amazing person.

115
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:28,049
I'm telling you this as her best friend,

116
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:31,302
but I've never seen her
cry over a man before.

117
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:37,767
Don't let her go, please.

118
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:50,279
Mr. Choi.

119
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,002
Well…

120
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,921
I was worried we'd miss each other.

121
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:50,756
I…

122
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,594
I was so flustered earlier
that I left my phone at my store.

123
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:57,763
You know I often forget my phone.

124
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:01,517
I try not to, but it's not easy.

125
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:05,313
I'm supposed to carry it with me
so people can reach me anytime,

126
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,691
but I'm forgetful by nature.

127
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:13,404
What I'm trying to tell you is,

128
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:14,989
that's why I couldn't call you.

129
00:10:15,072 --> 00:10:17,283
But I really needed to see you--

130
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,499
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

131
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,920
Why did you have to punish me like this?

132
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:35,760
I had no idea and suffered so much
trying to get over you.

133
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,514
I really wish you'd told me.

134
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,813
Mr. Choi, the helmet.

135
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,152
That's what that was.

136
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,297
…isn't actually my mom.

137
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,092
She's my aunt, and she's single.

138
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:18,719
So this isn't a scandal.

139
00:11:19,804 --> 00:11:20,846
It's just a romance.

140
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,309
RECENT CALLS

141
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,268
NAM HAE-E

142
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,981
Mom.

143
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:38,280
Where's your brother?

144
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,657
Have you seen him?

145
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:41,742
Was he not here when you got home?

146
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,244
No, he wasn't.

147
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:51,419
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be redirected to voicemail…

148
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,795
Damn it.

149
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,841
NO SIGNAL

150
00:11:57,716 --> 00:12:00,219
What's wrong? Why are you looking for him?

151
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:05,307
How was the math performance assessment?

152
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,851
Did something happen to him?

153
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,354
-I'm asking about the assessment.
-That's not important right now.

154
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,523
-I'll go look for him.
-No need.

155
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,818
It's nothing. Go to your academy.

156
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,366
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be redirected…

157
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:35,713
ANIMAL MEDICAL CENTER

158
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,092
Like I explained last time,

159
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:44,054
after the cat had fallen from a height
from being hit by a metal ball,

160
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,599
I'd managed to stop
the pulmonary hemorrhage,

161
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:49,560
but the spleen had to be removed
because it was badly damaged.

162
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,105
I thought it was over the hump,

163
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,651
but it developed
acute pulmonary edema today.

164
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:01,780
What kind of psycho
does this to stray cats?

165
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,956
You must be so upset.

166
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,878
You've been looking after
this poor thing all this time.

167
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:43,280
This reminds me
of how I felt here that night.

168
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,283
What do you mean?

169
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:48,994
"What do you mean?"

170
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,331
How can you say that?

171
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:53,916
You don't know this place?

172
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:55,709
-It's the Han River.
-The "Han River"?

173
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:57,336
The plain old Han River?

174
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,256
As known to every Seoul citizen
and even their dogs?

175
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,715
So that's it?

176
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,343
That's what this place is all about?

177
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:09,932
Fine, you may not know.

178
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:11,976
That's fine.

179
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,312
I guess I was the only one who missed you.

180
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,568
So tell me, Haeng-seon.

181
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,363
When did it all start?

182
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,907
When did you start…

183
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,701
What do you mean?

184
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,416
I'm not sure.

185
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:41,797
At first…

186
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:43,841
You're scaring him!

187
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,220
Damn it.

188
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,932
I thought you were a nutjob.

189
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:53,267
What's going on?

190
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,269
Just leave.

191
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:57,313
Then you were a nutjob
who was full of yourself.

192
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,523
I didn't understand
why you had to be so cold.

193
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,566
Get back in here.

194
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,069
Mr. Choi is fishing.

195
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:05,779
And then I realized

196
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:08,699
that you were lonely rather than cold.

197
00:15:09,867 --> 00:15:12,202
What about dinner? Have you eaten?

198
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,372
But at some point, I thought,

199
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,249
"This man is surprisingly kind."

200
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,752
"What's this warmth I'm feeling?"

201
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,632
I was concerned at first, then tormented,

202
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:28,594
then resentful, and then longing.

203
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,930
In the end,

204
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,222
here we are.

205
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,976
What about you?

206
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:39,355
When did you start having feelings for me?

207
00:15:40,564 --> 00:15:41,607
Me?

208
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,984
Well…

209
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,696
Maybe from the get-go.

210
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,240
That's impossible.

211
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,034
We got into a chase.

212
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:53,994
It couldn't have been worse.

213
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,204
That's true, but still…

214
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,251
I somehow felt drawn to you.

215
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,922
You bothered, upset, and frustrated me.

216
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,676
Before I knew it,

217
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,720
my life got a lot more fun.

218
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,431
It used to be so boring.

219
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:21,271
You liked me because I was fun?

220
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,898
Yes. Why?

221
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,316
That's a big deal.

222
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,319
Then why don't you go out
with a comedian instead?

223
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,571
I can't believe you said that.

224
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,951
You're the first guy to like me
since a boy liked me when I was 17.

225
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,953
What a disappointment.

226
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,956
I bragged about being
the Trillion Won Man,

227
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,084
but I never enjoyed my life.

228
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:45,462
I'd crawl into my bed after a hectic day,

229
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:49,925
and it'd always feel like
something very important was missing.

230
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,053
And I had trouble sleeping.

231
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,600
But you found that for me.

232
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,228
The missing piece.

233
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:07,484
You're my second savior,
following your mother.

234
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:12,740
And you're just as precious to me
as my first savior was.

235
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,996
Have you been getting tutored on
how to talk sweetly?

236
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:21,040
I can't believe you.

237
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,289
Where have you been?

238
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,002
Stop right there!

239
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,597
The night of September 28, at Saeam Vista.

240
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,641
Why did you go there?

241
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,185
Don't even try to weasel out of this.

242
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:28,482
SEPTEMBER 28
SAEAM VISTA

243
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:29,775
A person died.

244
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,737
The police are investigating the case
to find the killer.

245
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:36,406
Tell me.

246
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,284
Why were you there at that exact time?

247
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,663
I can't help you unless you tell me.

248
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:45,874
Hui-jae.

249
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,212
Why on earth were you there?

250
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,633
What the hell have you been up to?

251
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,718
Hui-jae!

252
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,347
Open the door, Hui-jae!

253
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,016
Hui-jae!

254
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,746
RESET PHONE

255
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,914
RESET ALL SETTINGS

256
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,625
RESETTING DATA…

257
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:50,439
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

258
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,365
I couldn't ride with you anyway.
You should've just gone home.

259
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,619
Still, it's late.

260
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:05,871
Go home now.

261
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,539
Go in first.

262
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:09,666
Go first. I live right here.

263
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,543
I'll leave after I see you go in.

264
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:14,630
I'm not going in before you leave.

265
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,423
-Just go in--
-Go on.

266
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:19,635
I'll be on my way.

267
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,470
Bye.

268
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:29,603
Goodness!

269
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,023
Cripes.

270
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:39,696
-I can't believe you guys.
-So? Are you two together now?

271
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,115
I don't know. What do you care?

272
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,451
Tell me everything,
or I won't be able to sleep.

273
00:20:44,534 --> 00:20:45,702
So what happened?

274
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,205
Are you together now?

275
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:51,041
Did you hold hands and hug?

276
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:52,209
Or did you already…

277
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,919
Don't be ridiculous.

278
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,339
Yeong-ju tells me Chi-yeol might become
my brother-in-law. Is that true?

279
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,216
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

280
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:01,093
Still, I'm curious.

281
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,594
So what happened?

282
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,804
You too?

283
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,264
Some fryvacy, please.

284
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,890
"Privacy," not "fryvacy."

285
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,600
Has nothing to do with fried eggs.

286
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,518
Anyway.

287
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,019
Head upstairs now, okay?

288
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,646
Dismissed.

289
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:13,605
Go on.

290
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:16,566
So you guys are going out now, right?

291
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,777
Does that make him my brother-in-law?

292
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,654
-Don't get ahead of yourself.
-Come on!

293
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,740
Gosh.

294
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:24,866
When's the wedding?

295
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,202
If you get married,
would we still live together?

296
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,328
I want to move out.

297
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,329
Hey.

298
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,707
I guess the wedding will be at a hotel.

299
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:32,749
-Hey.
-Gosh.

300
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,209
-Get out!
-Just tell us!

301
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:37,462
Yeong-ju tells me
I might get a nephew. Is that true?

302
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,964
-Tell us.
-There you go again.

303
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,090
You're together, right?

304
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:58,025
DID YOU GET HOME OKAY?

305
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:02,446
I DID

306
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,451
GOOD NIGHT. AND GOOD LUCK TOMORROW.

307
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:11,496
YOU SHOULD CUT BACK ON COFFEE, BY THE WAY

308
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,335
GOOD NIGHT!

309
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:17,753
What is this?

310
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,048
This is cute.

311
00:22:22,382 --> 00:22:24,009
I should send a sticker too.

312
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,886
POPULAR STICKERS

313
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:27,471
Let's see here.

314
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,515
There are so many.

315
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,393
I'll just buy all of them.

316
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:38,106
PURCHASE

317
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,488
Oh, my.

318
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,532
What is this?

319
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:50,410
What's with him?

320
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,919
-Hae-e!
-Yes?

321
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,003
Nam Hae-e!

322
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:05,133
You should remind me when I forget.
I'm two days late.

323
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,718
I have some left from last week.

324
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,429
That's impossible.
Don't be such a scrooge.

325
00:23:09,513 --> 00:23:11,014
Treat your friends sometimes.

326
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,308
Okay. Thank you.

327
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:14,476
-Hae-e.
-Yes?

328
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,522
Will you be okay?

329
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:20,982
The kids at your school
must have seen it yesterday.

330
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,777
Don't worry. It's no big deal.

331
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:30,408
I'm really fine.

332
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,911
I was younger back then. I've grown since.

333
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,582
I read this in a book.

334
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,253
"One should overcome
their psychological trauma before 40

335
00:23:41,336 --> 00:23:42,838
in order to mature."

336
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:45,966
And I plan to do that this year,
20 years ahead of time.

337
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,009
I'm off.

338
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:50,011
See you.

339
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:51,763
-Have a nice day!
-You too!

340
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,436
Hae-e!

341
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:44,733
Hey, you're amazing. So incredible.

342
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,693
Dan-ji.

343
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:50,780
I'm sorry.

344
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,617
I always wanted to tell you.

345
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,119
Forget it. I couldn't have done it either.

346
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:59,122
And to be honest,
it's all the grown-ups' fault.

347
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:05,962
Hey, Hae-e.

348
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:07,297
You looked great on camera.

349
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,470
You rock.

350
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:28,526
-Here comes our star.
-Nam Star.

351
00:25:28,610 --> 00:25:31,655
-Hae-e!
-You were amazing!

352
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:36,993
You're the best!

353
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:53,343
FROM CHEATER TO ROMANTIC,
CHOI CHI-YEOL HAS A CLOSE SHAVE

354
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,682
CONTACTS

355
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,641
CHOI CHI-YEOL

356
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,317
Congratulations on coming out
on the other side.

357
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,194
What's gotten into him?

358
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,285
My phone's been blowing up all morning.

359
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,246
Interview and TV appearance requests
are flooding in.

360
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,373
Mr. Popular sure has a lot of influence.

361
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:25,375
Public opinion is a funny thing.

362
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,545
Online communities are calling you
"the romantic of the century."

363
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:30,630
"Romantic"? Cripes.

364
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:32,090
They can all go to hell.

365
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:34,592
They called me a star cheater
until a few days ago.

366
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,852
-Mr. Choi.
-Goodness.

367
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,938
You guys are all glowing.

368
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,023
Got some good rest?

369
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,942
-I'm sorry, Mr. Choi.
-Oh, boy.

370
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:53,611
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Don't do this.

371
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:56,448
It was rash of us.

372
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,949
I looked up to you so much.

373
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,576
That's why I was so disappointed.

374
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:03,121
I should've known
you'd never do such a thing.

375
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,040
I'm sorry, sir.

376
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:09,461
Give me a second chance,
and I'll devote my life to you.

377
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,630
Will you please take us back?

378
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:17,886
There's no need to devote your life
or kneel down.

379
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:22,599
I'm sorry I disappointed you guys.

380
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,145
Welcome back, Hyo-won.

381
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:35,820
Did he just call me "Hyo-won"?

382
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,740
He said my name correctly.

383
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,202
-He called me "Hyo-won."
-Congratulations.

384
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,787
-Thank you!
-Thank you, sir!

385
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:46,289
-We'll work hard!
-Thank you!

386
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,665
-I love you!
-Gosh.

387
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,000
-Give these to them.
-Okay.

388
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,005
They didn't have to send flowers.

389
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,382
CONGRATULATIONS
PRIVATE ACADEMY ASSOCIATION

390
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,218
-Let's keep this one here.
-Got it.

391
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:02,055
By the way,
Triple Top keeps asking to meet with you.

392
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,848
Should I arrange a meeting?

393
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,477
They're presenting a better offer
than Awesome Best

394
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,062
and are probably a better fit.

395
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,397
Sure, I'll meet with them.

396
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,648
Okay.

397
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,694
It's me, Mr. Choi.

398
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,033
Well…

399
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,288
Let me cut to the chase
and be straightforward with you.

400
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:29,958
Mr. Choi,

401
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:33,920
I want you back at The Pride.

402
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,966
-Why?
-Why else?

403
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:40,176
We need you.

404
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,971
-We're desperate.
-No, I'm genuinely curious.

405
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,932
You now have Song Jun-ho

406
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,434
in addition to Jin I-sang.

407
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,644
You can't possibly need
a third math teacher.

408
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,438
The thing is…

409
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:55,775
I thought Song Jun-ho
had sorted things out with Perfect M,

410
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:59,654
but they're now demanding more money
from him for breaking contract.

411
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,030
Gosh.

412
00:29:02,699 --> 00:29:04,117
And about Mr. Jin…

413
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,498
This is top secret.

414
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,460
Actually, Mr. Jin…

415
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,007
I don't get why
these incidents keep happening.

416
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:21,468
What's wrong?

417
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:23,553
Did something happen to him?

418
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:25,722
Mr. Jin…

419
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,391
died.

420
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:31,853
The police think he was murdered.

421
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:39,569
-Do-gyeom.
-Yes?

422
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:41,863
Are there any phone numbers
that stand out?

423
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:46,075
Since it's an apartment complex,
there are way too many of them.

424
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,120
Have the victim's cell phone
and computer been analyzed?

425
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,747
The password hasn't been cracked.

426
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:51,998
Push them harder!

427
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:53,792
You have a friend at the KCSI, right?

428
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,835
They already have their hands full…

429
00:29:56,503 --> 00:29:58,505
But I will give them a call.

430
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,800
Jeez.

431
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,384
-Hey, Do-gyeom.
-Yes?

432
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:06,221
No DNA, no fingerprints.

433
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:07,972
Meticulous for a psycho, right?

434
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:10,350
-Why can't you be as--
-Detective Song! You need to see this.

435
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,477
What's this?

436
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:16,189
That's him, right? The black hoodie.

437
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:18,983
Is this the CCTV footage
from the victim's apartment?

438
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,403
Yes. But unfortunately,
we can't see his face.

439
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,740
If only we could see his face,
it'd give us a clue.

440
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:28,243
Go through the dashcam footage
from all the cars

441
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:30,411
that were parked there at that time.

442
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,538
Yes, sir.

443
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,206
-Get to it.
-Let's go.

444
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,175
Yes.

445
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,594
When will his ESTA be issued?

446
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,680
In three or four days?

447
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,559
Then please book
the earliest flight available after that.

448
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,979
Yes, the name is Lee Hui-jae.

449
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:57,939
Please keep me updated.

450
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,190
Ms. Jang.

451
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,778
-You have a consultation at 2 p.m.
-Right, I know.

452
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,780
Wait.

453
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,409
How many vacation days
do I have left this year?

454
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,829
Ms. Jung tells me

455
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:16,749
that Song Jun-ho hasn't sorted
things out with Perfect M yet.

456
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,919
And they've been putting pressure on him.

457
00:31:20,503 --> 00:31:22,297
That's not the only problem.

458
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:26,259
Ho-seong isn't satisfied
with his teaching.

459
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:30,179
He's apparently not ready to teach
top-level students yet.

460
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:32,557
Come to think of it,

461
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,809
Su-a has been complaining too,

462
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,728
but we have no choice.

463
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:42,984
Actually, the director's secretly trying
to get Choi Chi-yeol back on board.

464
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,528
If he does come back to The Pride,

465
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:49,365
wouldn't it be ideal for him
to teach the All Care students?

466
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,784
The scandal was just a misunderstanding.

467
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,287
I did hear that too.

468
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:58,875
But I doubt he'll come back.

469
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:02,170
Who knows what will happen
if the director desperately begs him?

470
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,296
Come on.

471
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,759
He may come back to The Pride,
but never to the All Care Program.

472
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:09,719
Just think about it.

473
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,096
Who started his scandal
in the first place?

474
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,016
It's not like he's a saint.

475
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,392
I know I wouldn't come back.

476
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:19,103
He must want nothing to do
with All Care anymore.

477
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:23,816
-Well, Ms. Cho.
-Yes?

478
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:28,529
How about you apologize to Ms. Nam?

479
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:29,656
Exactly.

480
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,074
Apologize to her

481
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,869
and ask her to persuade Mr. Choi
to take charge of the All Care Program

482
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,746
if he comes back to The Pride.

483
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:38,998
Are you crazy?

484
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,792
Why would I apologize to her?

485
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:46,047
They may not have been
up to anything inappropriate after all,

486
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,424
but they did make things look suspicious.

487
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,510
Ms. Nam isn't innocent either.

488
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,679
Why couldn't she have told us

489
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,766
that she was Hae-e's aunt
and that she was single?

490
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,935
What a sly woman.

491
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,145
That did surprise me.

492
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:03,481
-Right?
-You have a point.

493
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:06,776
But it's not like she caused us any harm.

494
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:08,778
Now that I know their story,

495
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,781
I feel sorry for Hae-e.

496
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,824
And her mom…

497
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,242
No, I mean her aunt.

498
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,954
Her aunt is incredible too.

499
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,915
So just apologize to her.

500
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,291
Please.

501
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:26,921
I miss her side dishes.

502
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,715
This is just too uncomfortable.

503
00:33:28,798 --> 00:33:31,384
I tried that other side dish store
in the supermarket,

504
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,510
but it was so salty.

505
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:33,761
-I know.
-Right?

506
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,056
Dan-ji only eats
one bowl of rice these days.

507
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:40,977
Be quiet! You never know
when to hold your tongue.

508
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:46,232
Anyway, I'll ask the director
to pressure Choi Chi-yeol

509
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,110
into teaching the All Care students again.

510
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,320
Let's go get something to eat.

511
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,282
It's on me. Let's go.

512
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,950
I had a lot for breakfast.

513
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,702
I have other plans.

514
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:00,121
All right, then let's go for lunch
some other time.

515
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:03,166
I have to be somewhere too.

516
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,543
You can pay for our drinks.

517
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,755
-Should I?
-Yes, that'd be best.

518
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,465
-Sure.
-Go ahead.

519
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,343
-Hi, there.
-I'll take one biji stew too.

520
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:15,678
Biji stew?

521
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,806
-I'll go bring some. One second.
-Okay.

522
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,308
I'll take these three.

523
00:34:20,391 --> 00:34:22,310
Sure. One second, please.

524
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:26,230
One namul, one rolled omelet,
and one shredded squid.

525
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,398
Ring hers up too.

526
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,193
It's your lucky day.

527
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,652
You're the best.

528
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:35,990
By the way, how did you decide
to raise your niece yourself?

529
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,076
I was so surprised.

530
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,536
You're incredible, ma'am.

531
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:42,246
I'm really not.

532
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,332
But you are.

533
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:48,044
To think you were accused
of being in an affair for no reason.

534
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,004
You must've been so frustrated.

535
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,507
That's life. Full of ups and downs.

536
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:53,800
Enjoy.

537
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,301
-Thank you.
-See you.

538
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,595
-Goodbye.
-See you again.

539
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,889
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

540
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,391
-Wel--
-Welcome.

541
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:05,144
Hello, Ms. Lee. Hi.

542
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,606
Right. Ms. Nam.

543
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:15,446
I'm sorry. It's a bit cramped here.

544
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,699
-We're sorry to take up your time.
-No problem.

545
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:21,327
-Thank you for the coffee.
-Sure.

546
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:23,996
So…

547
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,499
What did you want to talk about?

548
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,086
The thing is…

549
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,881
The All Care moms here and I

550
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:37,176
would like to apologize to you.

551
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,638
Fine. To be honest with you,

552
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:42,765
I took part in it too.

553
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:44,809
I'm talking about…

554
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,019
your scandal.

555
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:51,482
But I got it all wrong.

556
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:55,111
I shouldn't have done that
when our kids are such good friends.

557
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,448
I'm sorry, Ms. Nam.

558
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,701
I'm sorry too.

559
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,120
You must've been hurt. Please forgive us.

560
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,038
Don't worry about it.

561
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,124
It's all in the past now.

562
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:10,251
The situation was misleading.

563
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:11,794
I let go of things easily.

564
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,505
So please just continue to be my regulars.

565
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:15,423
Of course.

566
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:18,301
Don't worry! You can rest assured.

567
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:21,762
And there's one more thing.

568
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:26,809
I heard Mr. Choi
might come back to The Pride.

569
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,855
Could you put in a good word
for the All Care Program with him?

570
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:33,983
The kids desperately want him.

571
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:36,903
Well, I'm not sure.

572
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,155
I don't think
I'm in a position to do that.

573
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:40,948
Are you hot?

574
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,742
-No, I'm not.
-Come here.

575
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,119
-That's okay.
-Come on. That won't do.

576
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:48,080
-This is more like it.
-Please stop.

577
00:36:48,164 --> 00:36:49,373
-I'm okay.
-Do you like it?

578
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:50,750
-Ms. Lee.
-Was that too much?

579
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,460
-It's okay.
-I went overboard again.

580
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,586
Why are you doing this?

581
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,589
Mr. Jin…

582
00:36:58,132 --> 00:36:59,258
died.

583
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,553
The police think he was murdered.

584
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,643
Here's your coffee, sir.

585
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,897
I'll just have some water.

586
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,485
I'm cutting back on coffee.

587
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,155
Haeng-seon thinks I should.

588
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,449
I see.

589
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,661
Were you aware of Jin I-sang's death?

590
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,579
No.

591
00:37:28,663 --> 00:37:31,874
The director and the vice director
had been keeping a lid on it.

592
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,168
They were worried
about the academy's image,

593
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,963
especially after Lee Young-min's incident.

594
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:42,301
Why do these incidents keep occurring?

595
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:44,512
Tell me about it.

596
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:45,930
It's so tragic.

597
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:50,101
How will the kids manage
with both their math teachers gone

598
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,894
and their midterms coming up?

599
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:56,148
I'm sure the director
will find a replacement.

600
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,944
I've set up a meeting for you
with Triple Top on Monday.

601
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,071
Gerald Hotel at 2 p.m. Is that okay?

602
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:03,531
Sure.

603
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:43,738
I'll be working from home
for the next few days.

604
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,240
So don't even think of going out.

605
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:47,908
Also,

606
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,578
go stay with Aunt Hyeon-ju in the US

607
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,164
as soon as all the paperwork is done.

608
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,708
Just know that

609
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,586
this is the best I can do…

610
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:01,964
for you.

611
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:44,715
THE PRIDE ACADEMY

612
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,693
ANNUAL SALARY AGREEMENT
500,000,000 WON

613
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:08,739
Are you sure you're willing
to offer me these terms?

614
00:40:09,365 --> 00:40:11,534
Yes. I'm shaking too.

615
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:17,373
But I believe you have what it takes
to become a star teacher.

616
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:23,295
I'm betting the future
of The Pride on you. Got it?

617
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:25,131
Let's do this.

618
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,225
When the nth term of the sequence
looks like this,

619
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:37,643
what will the last term be?

620
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:42,481
Three times two to the power of six
over two minus one…

621
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:44,108
Within this range,

622
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,695
this equation has these three solutions.

623
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:48,988
Then what's a?

624
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,865
The correct answer is two.

625
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,910
All right. Let's move on.

626
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,496
It might have made you panic,
but there's no need.

627
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,497
Why?

628
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:01,125
-Because I took Choi Chi-yeol's course.
-Because I took Choi Chi-yeol's course.

629
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:04,128
Okay. What else comes to mind
when you see this type of question?

630
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:10,301
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

631
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:10,861
Okay.

632
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,822
Your skills have improved.

633
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,824
You must've studied hard on your own.

634
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:18,619
I just kept solving the same problems
because that was all I could do.

635
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:22,414
Great job.
Repetition is the best way to learn.

636
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:24,625
What about the other subjects?

637
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,672
Language Arts and English are fine,
but Life Science is a bit hard.

638
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:31,423
It can be.

639
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,801
The All Care Program
would've been helpful.

640
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,595
Too bad. I'm thinking of
checking out some online classes.

641
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:41,308
Are you okay, Hae-e?

642
00:42:42,977 --> 00:42:44,019
I am.

643
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:47,314
Now that I've gotten it off my chest,
it was no big deal.

644
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:50,150
I'm almost embarrassed.
I shouldn't have waited so long.

645
00:42:51,151 --> 00:42:53,571
I'm relieved that you feel that way.

646
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,536
Good work, Brother-in-Law.

647
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,705
"Brother-in-Law"?

648
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,082
You can't call him that yet.

649
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,417
Why not?

650
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,461
Yeong-ju said he's highly likely
to become my brother-in-law.

651
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,422
Can't I call you that, Brother-in-Law?

652
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,800
Well, I don't mind.

653
00:43:14,883 --> 00:43:16,385
Call me whatever you want.

654
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,429
See? Brother-in-Law approves of it.

655
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,307
-Here's your lunch box.
-Right.

656
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,976
And this is quince tea.
It soothes your throat.

657
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,145
Drink it instead of coffee.

658
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,146
Thanks.

659
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:30,941
Come on. I make it for you guys too.

660
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,944
-Sure you do.
-We didn't say anything.

661
00:43:35,571 --> 00:43:38,699
But do I have to go eat this at home?

662
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:42,286
-Sorry?
-It's a hassle to reheat it.

663
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,955
How about I eat it here?

664
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,042
Well…

665
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,043
What?

666
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:58,886
Eat it all, not just what you like most.

667
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,138
Keep going.

668
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,765
What do you mean?

669
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,016
I mean the nagging.

670
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:06,352
It feels awesome
being nagged while eating.

671
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:08,771
I usually eat alone,
hunched over my tablet.

672
00:44:08,854 --> 00:44:10,230
You're strange.

673
00:44:10,814 --> 00:44:11,857
Thank you.

674
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:28,040
Or you can feed me if you want.

675
00:44:28,123 --> 00:44:28,999
What's with you?

676
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,377
Have you gone crazy? They might hear you.

677
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,671
What's the matter with you?

678
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:36,715
You're a former handball player.
You can't hit people with those hands.

679
00:44:36,799 --> 00:44:39,385
Then please don't give me
a reason to do so.

680
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,889
Have you decided which academy to join?

681
00:44:45,724 --> 00:44:48,560
I'm still considering a few offers.

682
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:51,397
I'm meeting with the one
with the best offer tomorrow.

683
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,900
But I feel a bit uneasy.

684
00:44:56,318 --> 00:44:58,821
The director of The Pride
came to see me earlier.

685
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,155
He wants me back.

686
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,575
After kicking me out so coldly.

687
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,038
Then again, I did cause him some trouble.

688
00:45:08,997 --> 00:45:11,500
And he always did his best to humor me.

689
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:15,045
He was also the first one
to recognize my potential.

690
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,465
I'm also concerned about my old students.

691
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:21,135
So it's decided then.

692
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:25,389
How can you join another academy
if so many things bother you?

693
00:45:26,098 --> 00:45:28,725
I think you should give him
a second chance.

694
00:45:29,309 --> 00:45:32,771
If the same thing happens again,
you can leave with a lighter heart.

695
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:34,690
In sports, too,

696
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:37,401
you only get a red card
after receiving a yellow card.

697
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,782
It sounds like he deserves a little mercy.

698
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,034
A yellow card.

699
00:45:46,618 --> 00:45:50,247
I was actually going to keep quiet
because the All Care moms had asked me

700
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,040
to put in a good word with you.

701
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,294
But I can see that
you'll feel uneasy elsewhere,

702
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:56,837
no matter how much you get paid.

703
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:02,676
Okay.

704
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:03,886
I'll think about it.

705
00:46:05,137 --> 00:46:06,763
Now feed me.

706
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,931
Stop it.

707
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:10,184
Come on. They'll hear you.

708
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,853
Just eat up.

709
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:13,770
Okay.

710
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,272
My goodness.

711
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,195
He'll be here in a minute.
He's coming straight from home.

712
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,404
Don't worry.

713
00:46:22,488 --> 00:46:24,531
I got here early because I was so excited.

714
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:27,910
You're quite famous yourself too.

715
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,953
As Mr. Choi's only confidant.

716
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,122
Please help me out.

717
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,666
If this deal doesn't go through,
I'm done for.

718
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,919
I've canceled every other deal.

719
00:46:37,002 --> 00:46:38,128
You can relax.

720
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,339
He wouldn't meet with you
unless he's decided.

721
00:46:40,422 --> 00:46:41,673
I see.

722
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,595
Oh, my. Good to see you, Mr. Choi.

723
00:46:46,678 --> 00:46:48,430
You're early. I don't think I'm late.

724
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:52,851
I got here early because
I was excited to see you.

725
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:54,978
Take a seat. Please.

726
00:46:55,562 --> 00:46:56,730
No.

727
00:46:56,813 --> 00:46:58,815
I'm not going to stay.

728
00:47:00,108 --> 00:47:03,153
-Pardon?
-I've made up my mind about what to do.

729
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:08,450
But I thought it was only right
that I tell you in person.

730
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,955
I apologize for wasting your time.

731
00:47:13,038 --> 00:47:14,748
What are you talking about?

732
00:47:14,831 --> 00:47:16,458
-Mr. Choi.
-I wish you all the best.

733
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,210
Good luck.

734
00:47:19,127 --> 00:47:20,087
Mr. Choi!

735
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:22,631
-Mr. Choi!
-Just a second, sir.

736
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,510
You've made up your mind?
What do you mean?

737
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:27,719
It's just as I said.

738
00:47:27,803 --> 00:47:29,388
I thought about it all night,

739
00:47:29,471 --> 00:47:31,098
and I'm going back to The Pride.

740
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:34,726
Why? They turned their back on you
at a crucial moment.

741
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,395
So why are you going back?

742
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:37,896
You don't like Triple Top?

743
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:40,148
-They're willing to meet your offers--
-I think…

744
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,193
I'll feel better that way.

745
00:47:44,278 --> 00:47:47,739
We've been through too much together
to just cut them off so easily.

746
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:51,785
I think I'll regret it
if I don't give them a yellow card first.

747
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:58,250
Did Ms. Nam persuade you again?

748
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,961
That's part of it.

749
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,880
Mr. Kang was the first one
to recognize my potential.

750
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:06,758
I wouldn't feel comfortable
walking away from him like this.

751
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,888
Right. I'm heading
to Nation's Best after work.

752
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,557
It's Chicken Day. You're invited.

753
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,641
Mr. Choi.

754
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:16,935
Also, tell The Pride
that I'm only coming back

755
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:19,438
if Hae-e is readmitted
into the All Care Program.

756
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,315
That spot was hers anyway.

757
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,151
Now then, please wrap up here.

758
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:32,993
Mr. Choi!

759
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,494
Wait, sir.

760
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,871
Mr. Ji.

761
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,040
How dare he do this?

762
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:40,917
Why did he even agree to a meeting?
Is he playing me?

763
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,045
If he keeps this up, I won't sit back.

764
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:46,214
I'll notify the association
and work the media if need be.

765
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:49,134
Please calm down, sir.

766
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:51,094
-You can talk to me.
-I mean…

767
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:53,930
Didn't you say it was a done deal?

768
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:54,890
I'm sorry.

769
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:57,059
Let me talk to him again on the phone…

770
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:00,646
FIND K WHEN A AND B ARE
NON-ZERO REAL NUMBERS

771
00:49:27,964 --> 00:49:29,508
Well done. It's correct.

772
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:38,016
Geon-hu is living proof
that nothing is impossible.

773
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,017
You've improved.

774
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,311
Yes, I have, sir.

775
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,939
I can now solve the first six problems
from every previous exam.

776
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,273
Good for you.

777
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:47,025
Fine.

778
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:49,111
Let me promise something.

779
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,321
If you get into college,

780
00:49:51,405 --> 00:49:53,198
I'll grant you a wish.

781
00:49:57,994 --> 00:49:58,829
No, thank you.

782
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,456
There's someone else
I want to strike a deal with.

783
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:02,582
"Someone else"?

784
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:04,209
-"Someone else"?
-Who?

785
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:07,754
Hey, Hae-e.

786
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,342
If I get into college,

787
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,095
go out with me.

788
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:26,440
Okay. I'll leave you two

789
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,567
to sort out that deal.

790
00:50:28,650 --> 00:50:30,986
That's all for today.
Don't fall asleep next period.

791
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,114
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

792
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,782
Answer him, Hae-e.

793
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,159
Are you going out with him?

794
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:39,327
Are you really going to date him?

795
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,748
-Go out with him!
-Go out with him!

796
00:50:42,831 --> 00:50:45,667
-Go out with him!
-Go out with him!

797
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:48,003
-Hold on, guys!
-Go out with him!

798
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,045
He's just joking.

799
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,132
-Come on.
-What's with you?

800
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:57,053
-Go out with him!
-Go out with him!

801
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:01,516
-Go out with him!
-Go out with him!

802
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,771
Gosh.

803
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,774
Awesome, man.

804
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,028
I knew you weren't normal,
but you really are a lost cause.

805
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,950
Are you stressed out by all the studying?

806
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,368
Has it gotten to your head?

807
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,078
No, I'm completely sane.

808
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,622
That's why I like you.

809
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,377
Why would you say that out loud in class?

810
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,463
In front of the entire class
and the teacher?

811
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:34,299
Are you upset because I said it in class?
Sorry about that.

812
00:51:39,721 --> 00:51:41,139
Why am I even talking to you?

813
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,726
Let's just drop it.

814
00:51:47,062 --> 00:51:49,564
Hey, it's not like
I'm asking you out right now.

815
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:52,567
Honestly, the chances of me
getting into college are pretty slim.

816
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,194
You have nothing to lose.

817
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:55,862
-Be quiet and go away.
-Hey.

818
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,614
Hae-e.

819
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:00,867
I said go away.

820
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,204
Are you following me into the girls' room?

821
00:52:05,831 --> 00:52:08,291
GIRLS' RESTROOM

822
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,566
Jeez.

823
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:34,359
What the hell?

824
00:52:34,442 --> 00:52:36,111
You stabbed me in the back.

825
00:52:37,279 --> 00:52:38,738
So how does that feel?

826
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:40,407
I see.

827
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,742
I didn't stab you in the back.

828
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:45,203
I told you I had a crush on Hae-e.

829
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:46,913
Also,

830
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,124
when you hesitate, you get scored on.

831
00:52:50,458 --> 00:52:52,335
I'm going to study real hard, Sun-jae.

832
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:06,766
Have you found anything?

833
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:09,728
Detective Song,
about the guy in the black hoodie.

834
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:12,355
-Yes?
-His face got caught on a dashcam.

835
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:13,356
Really?

836
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,236
There we go. This will be enough.

837
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,615
Did you say he isn't in the system?

838
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,158
Yes. There's no match.

839
00:53:23,742 --> 00:53:24,784
Okay.

840
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:26,995
Analyze the CCTV footage
and find out where he went.

841
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,705
If you can't track him, put out an alert.

842
00:53:28,788 --> 00:53:30,332
-Yes, sir!
-Let's go.

843
00:53:30,415 --> 00:53:31,791
-Get to it.
-Yes!

844
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:36,171
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

845
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,632
Goodness.

846
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,676
It really is "the more, the merrier."

847
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:44,387
Chicken Day got so much more fun. Right?

848
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,389
-Yes, this is awesome.
-I agree.

849
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:48,308
I'm happy if you guys are happy.

850
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:51,937
Mr. Ji, each person
must finish one chicken. Right?

851
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:55,315
Yes, it's a sin to waste food. Right?

852
00:53:55,398 --> 00:53:57,108
Look at the sparks between those two.

853
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,655
It's so cringey and nice. Right, Mr. Ji?

854
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,156
Yes.

855
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,243
How about we make a toast?

856
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:15,627
Everyone, good work today.

857
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:18,630
-Good work!
-Good work!

858
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:27,013
This reminds me.

859
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:29,224
We played foot volleyball last time.

860
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,643
That's right. We lost by a hair.

861
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,395
"By a hair"?

862
00:54:33,478 --> 00:54:35,563
You're supposed to be good with numbers.

863
00:54:35,647 --> 00:54:36,898
It was a crushing defeat.

864
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:40,026
We lost 21 to 3, Brother-in-Law.

865
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,321
To be precise,
we didn't lose, but we gave up.

866
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,865
The game stopped when I got injured.

867
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,951
Just own up to it.

868
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,662
Fine. Would you be up for a rematch?

869
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:54,541
But we're watching a movie after this.

870
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:57,252
Tonight we're watching
My Octopus Teacher, Brother-in-Law.

871
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:58,962
A little tact, please, Uncle.

872
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:00,463
Not today.

873
00:55:00,547 --> 00:55:02,882
Yes, we can watch that some other time.

874
00:55:03,383 --> 00:55:04,759
Let's go break a little sweat.

875
00:55:04,843 --> 00:55:08,722
But since it's a bit obnoxious
if the couple is on the same team,

876
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:12,475
it'll be Team Chi-yeol
versus Team Haeng-seon.

877
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,060
What should we play?

878
00:55:16,104 --> 00:55:17,230
What do you think?

879
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:20,692
What about you, Mr. Choi?

880
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:31,327
When the ball reaches such a high speed,

881
00:55:31,411 --> 00:55:34,414
even a slight mistake
can result in a gutter ball.

882
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,082
That's not it.

883
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,376
Your ball speed was lower than Yeong-ju's.

884
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,146
You're so good!

885
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,856
High five!

886
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:01,441
You're basically a pro!

887
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,650
Bravo!

888
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:05,987
Mr. Ji, can you teach me
the proper position?

889
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:07,322
How do you take the steps?

890
00:56:08,865 --> 00:56:09,991
Teach me too.

891
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:13,203
-Arm close to your body.
-I want to try too.

892
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:16,581
-Left foot.
-Left foot.

893
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:19,334
-Right foot.
-Just do it in one go, Dong-hui.

894
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,503
In one fell swoop.

895
00:56:24,089 --> 00:56:26,091
I lost by a hair again.

896
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:27,967
Let's do this again.

897
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,803
As you wish.

898
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,972
You can pay for the game today, please.

899
00:56:33,765 --> 00:56:34,682
Sure.

900
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:36,643
And return these, please.

901
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,771
Jae-woo, let's split the bill.

902
00:56:40,939 --> 00:56:41,940
Mr. Ji.

903
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,528
You're definitely
more athletic than Mr. Choi.

904
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,154
You nailed foot volleyball too.

905
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,574
-But I'm no match for you.
-Come on.

906
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:54,285
You're also very persuasive.

907
00:56:58,248 --> 00:57:00,416
Mr. Choi says he's staying with The Pride.

908
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:03,878
I thought he was set on leaving.

909
00:57:03,962 --> 00:57:05,296
You changed his mind, right?

910
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,800
Hae-e's so lucky
to have a competent aunt like you.

911
00:57:23,106 --> 00:57:26,234
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

912
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,695
Hey, let's drink this and wake up.

913
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:36,870
I really need to sign up for a gym
or find a trainer.

914
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:39,330
My body is aching all over
after yesterday.

915
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,666
Right. We should work out regularly.

916
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:43,877
Hey.

917
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,171
What happened to your running club?

918
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,839
Forget it.

919
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,132
It's no fun.

920
00:57:49,215 --> 00:57:50,842
Hey, are you being left out?

921
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:52,802
Is that why you stopped going?

922
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,305
That's not it.

923
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:58,224
There are no hot guys there.

924
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:04,063
If only any of the members
were as hot as Mr. Ji.

925
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,442
He doesn't even sweat when he runs.

926
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:10,320
He always looks so fresh and neat.

927
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:15,575
What kind of person do you think he is?

928
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,327
He's such a nice person.

929
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,287
He's well-mannered and sweet.

930
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:22,290
Not too talkative either.
Isn't that the best?

931
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:24,375
I'm sure you think so.

932
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:26,753
What? You don't?

933
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,589
No, it's not that. It's just…

934
00:58:30,673 --> 00:58:31,549
Never mind.

935
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,051
What is it?

936
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:35,553
Finish your sentence. I'm curious.

937
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:36,971
What is it?

938
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:40,475
I mean…

939
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,685
I have a feeling…

940
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:44,187
he--

941
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,608
Nation's Best Banchan. Yes.

942
00:58:50,235 --> 00:58:51,444
I see.

943
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,612
Fifty lunch boxes.

944
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:54,948
Sure.

945
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:57,033
Can I have the address, please?

946
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,371
Yes.

947
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,375
You've been publicly asked out, Ms. Nam.

948
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:06,960
How do you feel now?

949
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:11,506
"Given my looks and intelligence,
it's no wonder."

950
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,007
Is that what you think?

951
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:15,260
Stop talking about it.

952
00:59:19,097 --> 00:59:20,723
What's that? Give me some too.

953
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,184
If I eat this, will I be asked out too?

954
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:25,311
Is that it?

955
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:27,438
Be quiet.
It just gives me an energy boost.

956
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,108
Hey.

957
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,317
You can have one.

958
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,319
-Thanks.
-Here.

959
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:38,741
I didn't know this,
but Geon-hu seems to be pretty popular.

960
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,244
The entire school knows
that he asked you out now.

961
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,079
Some girls in tenth grade even cried.

962
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,707
You're their enemy now.

963
00:59:46,374 --> 00:59:47,834
So are you going to date him?

964
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,378
Or are you just going to flirt?

965
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,840
Hey, we'll be seniors soon.

966
00:59:56,175 --> 00:59:58,094
So cut it out already.

967
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:07,520
I broke my favorite hair tie.

968
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:10,982
All the girls' resentment toward you
must have reached it.

969
01:00:11,065 --> 01:00:12,734
It's cursed.

970
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,402
-Want to borrow mine?
-Please.

971
01:00:17,697 --> 01:00:19,198
-Give it here.
-I don't want to.

972
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:21,659
Gosh, you little…

973
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:25,330
Guys, I'm off.
I need to see our homeroom teacher.

974
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:27,040
-See you guys.
-See you.

975
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:28,583
-Bye.
-Bye.

976
01:00:28,666 --> 01:00:30,168
-Hae-e.
-Yes?

977
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:33,004
If anyone scowls at you, just ignore them.

978
01:00:33,087 --> 01:00:35,548
You're everyone's enemy now.

979
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,676
-Bye.
-Bye.

980
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:48,144
Why don't you ask her out?

981
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,730
What?

982
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:51,856
Why are you surprised?

983
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,317
You have a crush on Hae-e too.
So why don't you?

984
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:58,488
Hey.

985
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:00,281
Everyone knows except Hae-e.

986
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,910
Your expression totally lights up
when you're with her.

987
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:05,161
So how could I not know?

988
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:09,123
Is that right?

989
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:10,833
So what is it?

990
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:13,878
Are you afraid
you'll ruin your friendship?

991
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,092
Geon-hu is charming.

992
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,594
If he keeps trying,
Hae-e might accept him in the end.

993
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:25,890
Be a man and at least ask her out.

994
01:01:28,935 --> 01:01:32,355
As for me, I like both you and Geon-hu.

995
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:33,564
Who should I root for?

996
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:38,444
What?

997
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:39,529
You have a problem?

998
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,783
Here.

999
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,331
Okay.

1000
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:52,792
Starting now, I'm on your side.

1001
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:56,504
But couldn't you open it
before giving it to me?

1002
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:58,423
Be more thoughtful next time.

1003
01:02:04,512 --> 01:02:06,180
-That one has 15.
-15.

1004
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,516
-And that one…
-Has 20.

1005
01:02:08,599 --> 01:02:09,684
-Okay.
-Okay.

1006
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,186
Tape this up.

1007
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,359
Oh, hello.

1008
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,444
Going out on delivery?

1009
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:22,447
We got an unexpected bulk order.

1010
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:24,365
What brings you here at this hour?

1011
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:27,785
I'll be extremely busy starting tomorrow,
so I stopped by to see you.

1012
01:02:28,369 --> 01:02:29,579
-Why…
-Oh, my!

1013
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:32,582
How have you been
hiding your feelings all this time?

1014
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,292
If Hae-e hadn't told the truth,

1015
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:36,919
you would've become lovesick.

1016
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:41,424
-Load these up. I'll give you a ride.
-No, I can deliver them on my scooter.

1017
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,968
-I don't think so.
-But still…

1018
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:48,014
Hey, he wants a date. A delivery date.

1019
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:51,225
My goodness.

1020
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:54,896
Have you contacted the victim?

1021
01:02:56,105 --> 01:02:57,190
Will they settle?

1022
01:03:00,067 --> 01:03:01,569
Okay, I'll be right there.

1023
01:03:03,863 --> 01:03:05,323
Goodness.

1024
01:03:32,892 --> 01:03:36,312
Be a man and at least ask her out.

1025
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:48,574
I broke my favorite hair tie.

1026
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,207
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1027
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,682
NAM HAE-E

1028
01:04:12,765 --> 01:04:14,100
MOM

1029
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:22,483
Hi, Mom.

1030
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:23,693
Where are you?

1031
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:25,611
I'm near the school.

1032
01:04:25,695 --> 01:04:27,154
I'm on my way to the study cafe.

1033
01:04:27,238 --> 01:04:28,698
Just head straight home.

1034
01:04:28,781 --> 01:04:31,325
Something came up,
so I'm at the office right now.

1035
01:04:31,409 --> 01:04:34,537
Study at home
and keep an eye on your brother.

1036
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,914
I locked his door,
so unlock it when you get home.

1037
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:37,874
Mom.

1038
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:40,585
You did what?

1039
01:04:40,668 --> 01:04:42,378
I have my reasons.

1040
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:43,588
Just do as I say.

1041
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:55,993
Hui-jae.

1042
01:05:56,869 --> 01:05:57,954
Hui-jae!

1043
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:02,708
Hui-jae!

1044
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:05,044
Hui-jae! Are you okay?

1045
01:06:05,127 --> 01:06:07,004
Hui-jae! What's wrong?

1046
01:06:07,838 --> 01:06:09,423
What happened?

1047
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:11,425
It's okay.

1048
01:06:12,176 --> 01:06:14,804
Breathe.

1049
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:15,888
Slowly.

1050
01:06:18,182 --> 01:06:19,183
It's okay.

1051
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:21,978
Everything's okay.

1052
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,189
Lunch box delivery.

1053
01:06:25,272 --> 01:06:26,816
-Hello.
-Hello.

1054
01:06:26,899 --> 01:06:29,485
Are you having an event?

1055
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:31,862
Yes, at a senior center.

1056
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:34,907
We had ordered from another store,
but their fridge broke down.

1057
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:36,450
I see. That's a bummer.

1058
01:06:36,534 --> 01:06:39,495
So you're carrying these
to the senior center?

1059
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:41,497
-Yes.
-I'll help you.

1060
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:45,418
So he was seen entering
Imperial Apartments?

1061
01:06:45,501 --> 01:06:47,044
Yes, according to the CCTV.

1062
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:50,715
So he either lives here
or passed through here.

1063
01:06:51,632 --> 01:06:54,176
Have you applied for a warrant
for the CCTV footage here?

1064
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,013
Yes. You can't get access
without a warrant these days.

1065
01:06:58,973 --> 01:07:00,182
Let's go and ask first.

1066
01:07:02,935 --> 01:07:04,353
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

1067
01:07:07,940 --> 01:07:09,150
He doesn't recognize him?

1068
01:07:09,233 --> 01:07:11,485
No. So many people live here.

1069
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:13,362
He can't possibly remember every face.

1070
01:07:14,697 --> 01:07:15,990
The complex is huge indeed.

1071
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:19,201
We'll have to check the CCTVs first.

1072
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,786
I'll see if the warrant is out.

1073
01:07:22,288 --> 01:07:23,289
Hey, kid.

1074
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:30,171
Have you seen this person around here?

1075
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:38,679
I'm not sure.

1076
01:07:42,224 --> 01:07:45,061
We can't ask everyone passing by.

1077
01:07:45,144 --> 01:07:46,020
Just a second.

1078
01:08:03,621 --> 01:08:04,455
Hui-jae.

1079
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,832
What's going on?

1080
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,292
Some men are looking for you.

1081
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,628
They look like detectives.

1082
01:08:12,713 --> 01:08:14,256
What happened?

1083
01:08:15,007 --> 01:08:17,093
Tell me so I can help you.

1084
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,138
Hold on.

1085
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,103
Hui-jae.

1086
01:08:27,186 --> 01:08:28,729
Go inside. Now.

1087
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,908
We're from Ganghyeon Police Station.
We're investigating a case.

1088
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:42,660
Are you home alone?

1089
01:08:45,162 --> 01:08:46,163
Yes.

1090
01:08:47,623 --> 01:08:48,958
We need to check something.

1091
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:50,835
May we come in?

1092
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:53,629
Sure.

1093
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:06,684
Can you tell us about your family?

1094
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,019
Do you have any siblings?

1095
01:09:09,603 --> 01:09:11,188
-I don't.
-You don't?

1096
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,838
-Hui-jae!
-Stop, you punk!

1097
01:09:35,921 --> 01:09:37,673
-Hui-jae!
-Get him!

1098
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:43,053
What took you so long?
I was bored to death.

1099
01:09:43,137 --> 01:09:45,514
I had to carry the lunch boxes
to the senior center.

1100
01:09:45,598 --> 01:09:47,099
And I promoted my store too.

1101
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:49,435
Here.

1102
01:09:50,394 --> 01:09:51,395
Thanks.

1103
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:10,080
You must've been quite thirsty, Ms. Nam.

1104
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:23,052
About Mr. Ji…

1105
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:25,012
Yes?

1106
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,933
He's more aloof than I thought.

1107
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:31,560
"Aloof"?

1108
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:34,688
That word is mostly used to describe me.

1109
01:10:35,272 --> 01:10:38,359
Dong-hui is far from aloof.

1110
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:40,903
He's always nice to everyone.

1111
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:43,530
Almost to a fault, in my opinion.

1112
01:10:45,157 --> 01:10:45,991
Why?

1113
01:10:47,493 --> 01:10:49,620
I used to think so too,

1114
01:10:50,162 --> 01:10:52,873
but I guess everyone is multifaceted.

1115
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,461
Did something happen?

1116
01:10:59,046 --> 01:11:01,006
-Yesterday…
-Yes?

1117
01:11:03,300 --> 01:11:04,635
Never mind.

1118
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:07,012
Something was just off
with the way he treated me.

1119
01:11:07,596 --> 01:11:09,139
"Off"? How?

1120
01:11:09,223 --> 01:11:11,183
It's just my hunch.

1121
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:16,272
I can't really put my finger on it,
but that's how it felt.

1122
01:11:18,941 --> 01:11:20,067
I'm not sure.

1123
01:11:20,734 --> 01:11:23,487
That doesn't really sound like him.

1124
01:11:24,905 --> 01:11:26,532
I'm relieved to hear that.

1125
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,287
Did you step over the line again?

1126
01:11:32,538 --> 01:11:34,915
-What?
-He's pretty individualistic.

1127
01:11:34,999 --> 01:11:37,626
He doesn't like it
when his boundaries are crossed.

1128
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,336
And you're very outgoing.

1129
01:11:39,420 --> 01:11:41,839
You don't have boundaries
with people you've just met.

1130
01:11:41,922 --> 01:11:43,299
I thought that might be it.

1131
01:11:45,050 --> 01:11:46,176
Mr. Choi.

1132
01:11:47,094 --> 01:11:49,471
I know I can be nosy,

1133
01:11:49,555 --> 01:11:52,558
but I know when to butt in and butt out.

1134
01:11:53,809 --> 01:11:57,104
What I mean is,
Dong-hui isn't that kind of person.

1135
01:11:57,187 --> 01:11:58,814
Why do you keep saying that?

1136
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,816
Then am I that kind of person?

1137
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,235
That's not what I meant.

1138
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:05,321
That's exactly what you meant.

1139
01:12:05,404 --> 01:12:07,740
Since Mr. Ji would never
act that way without reason

1140
01:12:07,823 --> 01:12:09,825
and I step over the line all the time,

1141
01:12:09,908 --> 01:12:11,827
you think I must be at fault.

1142
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,287
Why are you so extreme?

1143
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,830
I know it too.

1144
01:12:15,789 --> 01:12:19,043
You two are really close
and go back a long time.

1145
01:12:19,668 --> 01:12:21,211
He knows you better than I do.

1146
01:12:21,295 --> 01:12:24,381
But I want to get along with him.

1147
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:27,551
That's why I brought it up.
But why would you blame me for that?

1148
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:30,304
You have a way of making
everything you say offensive.

1149
01:12:34,308 --> 01:12:36,894
Come on, I couldn't have
offended you with that.

1150
01:12:36,977 --> 01:12:37,895
You did!

1151
01:12:38,854 --> 01:12:40,898
You said I step over the line
all the time!

1152
01:12:41,523 --> 01:12:43,150
That's just…

1153
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:29,822
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1154
01:13:29,905 --> 01:13:31,490
Sun-jae's brother,
who was said to be in the US,

1155
01:13:31,573 --> 01:13:33,617
turns out to have been holed up at home.

1156
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:35,577
-He committed a felony.
-What?

1157
01:13:35,661 --> 01:13:38,455
-Mom.
-Shut it! Don't say a single word!

1158
01:13:39,039 --> 01:13:40,707
About Mr. Ji…

1159
01:13:40,791 --> 01:13:43,377
Let's not talk about that anymore today.

1160
01:13:44,461 --> 01:13:46,922
-Did you two fight?
-No way! We're not kids.

1161
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:48,090
-Look at this.
-Where?

1162
01:13:48,173 --> 01:13:50,217
When I cut ties with someone,

1163
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:53,011
I am utterly merciless
and make a clean break.

1164
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,096
I never look back.

1165
01:13:54,179 --> 01:13:56,223
Should we go somewhere
when I become less busy?

1166
01:13:56,306 --> 01:13:57,266
No way!

1167
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:58,809
It's the sea!

1168
01:13:58,892 --> 01:14:00,686
Have you never seen it before?

1169
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:07,693
