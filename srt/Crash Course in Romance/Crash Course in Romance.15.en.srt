00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:08,985
THE RESULT OF CHANCE AND INEVITABILITY

3
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,988
GANGHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

4
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,287
-What are you doing, Haeng-ja?
-Gosh!

5
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,372
You scared me.

6
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,625
The nail polish almost got on her skin.

7
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,001
What do you think I'm doing?

8
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,002
Look.

9
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,921
Kids these days love this kind of stuff.

10
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,672
They're better at makeup than grown-ups.

11
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,466
For her toenails,

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,427
I went for flaming red. Nice, right?

13
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,555
Hae-e is in a coma.

14
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:39,390
The doctor needs to check her nails.

15
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:41,351
She might urgently need surgery too.

16
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,312
Remove it right now.

17
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,898
I just thought

18
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,567
it was a shame
that she was lying unconscious.

19
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:51,236
I wanted to pretty her up.

20
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,989
Are you lecturing your older sister?

21
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:58,618
Did you learn that
from your teacher boyfriend?

22
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:01,121
If you're so smart, remove it yourself.

23
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,248
I'll keep out of Hae-e's hair.

24
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,624
Good grief.

25
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,043
-What's with her?
-Jeez.

26
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:13,174
A lawyer has been charged with
leaking school exam questions to her son

27
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:15,176
and is currently under investigation.

28
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,303
This private high school
is located in Nokeun-ro,

29
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,055
-a private education mecca…
-That's near here.

30
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,515
Hey.

31
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:24,310
Isn't that Hae-e's school?

32
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:26,312
…came out on top in the midterms.

33
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,773
The police said
the student confessed to the school

34
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:32,026
that he had accessed
the exam questions beforehand,

35
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,444
bringing the case to light.

36
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,864
Shockingly, his mother, the suspect,

37
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:40,243
turns out to be a lawyer
working for a top firm.

38
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,036
This has been Choi Hyeon of JBC News.

39
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,705
Yes, that's Hae-e's school.

40
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,041
An 11th grader whose mom is a lawyer?

41
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:01,764
What do we do, Ms. Jang?

42
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,602
The entrance and the garage
are swarmed with reporters.

43
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,730
How did they find out
about your workplace?

44
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:11,983
Ms. Jang.

45
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,652
It's not true, is it?

46
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,237
They're mistaken, right?

47
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,078
I think you should sneak out
before they barge in here.

48
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,127
Should I go find some sunglasses or a hat?

49
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,506
That would only attract more attention.

50
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,681
She's here!

51
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:45,308
-She's here!
-She's here!

52
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,310
-Do you admit to the charges?
-Is this the first time?

53
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,604
-If this isn't your first time…
-Do you admit it?

54
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:52,148
-Please say something. Everyone's waiting.
-Is it true?

55
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:00,949
I'm her lawyer.

56
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:03,576
The case is still under investigation.

57
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,328
We have no comment at this time.

58
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,371
Coming through.

59
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:09,082
-No comment at all?
-Move.

60
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,375
Coming through!

61
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:29,936
How could the school
let things get so out of control?

62
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:36,943
The education director, of all people,

63
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:40,446
colluded with a parent
and leaked the exam questions.

64
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:43,866
How could the school
not even know about this?

65
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,785
This is appalling.

66
00:04:45,868 --> 00:04:49,831
I've only seen these things happen
on the news.

67
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,624
-I know.
-I have nothing to say.

68
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,209
I apologize.

69
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,254
A police investigation is underway.

70
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,965
-Please wait and--
-No, forget it.

71
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,970
How can we be sure that this brazen crime
has never been committed before?

72
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:08,558
You should look into all of
Sun-jae's grades in high school thus far

73
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,601
and adjust the other students' grades.

74
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,603
-I agree.
-She's right.

75
00:05:12,687 --> 00:05:14,856
-Absolutely.
-I agree. Please do so.

76
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:18,901
Also, as a fair punishment
for the student in question,

77
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,612
promise us his expulsion.

78
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,073
Ms. Cho.

79
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,909
Sun-jae wasn't involved in the crime
from the beginning…

80
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,455
In any case, he filled in
and submitted his answer sheet.

81
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:33,583
-Right.
-Knowing the questions had been leaked…

82
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,921
PAYMENT OF 2,178,000 WON APPROVED

83
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,552
As a result,
he got first place in the midterms.

84
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:48,347
The students who did their best
suffered disadvantages…

85
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,682
-She's right.
-Exactly.

86
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:50,725
This is unfair.

87
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:51,809
PAYMENT CANCELED

88
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,565
It's only fair to expel…

89
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:00,485
Excuse me.

90
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,362
SU-A'S DAD

91
00:06:04,447 --> 00:06:07,742
PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE

92
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,827
What is it? I'm busy.

93
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,997
It's about that credit card payment.

94
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,624
I was buying a gift for my client,

95
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,418
but I accidentally used my card
instead of the company card.

96
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:18,795
So I canceled it right away.

97
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,338
I get it.

98
00:06:20,421 --> 00:06:21,964
I'm at Su-a's school right now.

99
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:23,466
Hang up.

100
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,346
What did she say? Is she suspicious?

101
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:29,722
Not at all.

102
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:30,723
I told you.

103
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,102
All she cares about is
her kid's college admissions.

104
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,603
That's a relief.

105
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:37,814
I'll use it well, honey.

106
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,315
It's so pretty.

107
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:40,733
You're even prettier.

108
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,419
It's me. Is this a bad time?

109
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:03,131
No, I'm alone.

110
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:04,841
Are you at work?

111
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:06,634
I'm on my way.

112
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:08,636
I saw the news this morning.

113
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,847
It's about Hae-e's close friend, right?

114
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,353
Now I understand
why she submitted her exam blank.

115
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,772
Sun-jae must've shared
the questions without knowing

116
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:21,107
since they're good friends.

117
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:25,319
I know you're already shaken up,

118
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,614
so I'm sorry to tell you
something even more shocking.

119
00:07:32,201 --> 00:07:33,703
Is this about Mr. Ji?

120
00:07:35,329 --> 00:07:36,289
Yes.

121
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:40,084
Our suspicions about him may be correct.

122
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:43,421
I've worked with him for six years,

123
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,424
but apparently,
I don't know him very well.

124
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,218
Perhaps the yacht incident…

125
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,639
Nothing's certain yet.

126
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:56,225
I'll come to you
after I check on a few things.

127
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:58,895
Okay.

128
00:07:58,978 --> 00:07:59,812
Mr. Choi.

129
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,149
Be careful.

130
00:08:06,611 --> 00:08:07,612
I will.

131
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,049
This tastes so bland.

132
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:31,260
It's not like I'm the patient.

133
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,888
I need food that tastes better
to stay strong.

134
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,641
Can you go home
and bring back some side dishes?

135
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:38,726
A blanket too while you're at it.

136
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:41,354
It gets cold at night.
The blankets here are too thin.

137
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:44,357
It isn't that bad.
Just wear some more layers.

138
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,734
Hey, just do it for me.

139
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:49,570
You know I'm sensitive to cold.

140
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,614
Do you want another patient to look after?

141
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:53,199
Fine. What do you need?

142
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,785
-Tell me everything you need.
-There's a lot.

143
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,871
A hair dryer and hair rollers.

144
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,791
A deck of cards too.

145
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:05,586
It's so boring watching TV all day.
Please?

146
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:17,390
Hae-e.

147
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,101
What happened?

148
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,978
She just moved.

149
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,855
She just wiggled her finger.

150
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,023
Really?

151
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,986
No, she's not moving.

152
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,989
Are you sure? She's completely still.

153
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,074
No, I saw it clearly.

154
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:45,251
-Welcome back, Mr. Ji!
-Welcome back, Mr. Ji!

155
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:49,714
Thank you for the welcome, guys.

156
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:51,716
But it does feel a bit awkward.

157
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,176
Come on. These things happen.

158
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,804
They say the quarrels of lovers
are the renewal of love.

159
00:09:57,388 --> 00:09:59,056
I knew you'd come back.

160
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:02,435
After all these years,
you wouldn't break up over one dispute.

161
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,645
Still, I got quite scared.

162
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,022
Mr. Choi aside,

163
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,232
I'd never seen Mr. Ji so angry.

164
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,984
It was frightening.

165
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:12,361
-It almost gave me the creeps.
-Me too.

166
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,696
I didn't see that coming.

167
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:16,741
I admit that I went overboard.

168
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,492
Sorry for scaring you guys.

169
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,286
-Don't worry.
-That's fine.

170
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:22,830
Hyo-won, did you get your eyebrows done?

171
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,292
Gosh, you're scary.
It was just a slight trim.

172
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,044
Not even my mom noticed.

173
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:30,129
You have really sharp eyes.

174
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,214
It's not sharp eyes. I just pay attention.

175
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:36,927
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

176
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,310
Come in.

177
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:48,522
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

178
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:52,026
The academy is having a meeting
to plan the CSAT events for each subject.

179
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,613
It starts at 4 p.m.,
so why don't we get going soon?

180
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:01,327
Could you attend the meeting on my behalf?

181
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,662
-Me?
-Yes.

182
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:04,413
I must've strained myself.

183
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:06,999
I've got a cold sore, and it's killing me.

184
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,918
I barely managed to book an appointment.

185
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:10,711
Should we postpone and go to the hospital?

186
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:12,838
No need. Attend it on my behalf.

187
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,800
There will be a follow-up meeting anyway.

188
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,135
All right.

189
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,345
Thank you.

190
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:57,925
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

191
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:11,147
Really, Ms. Nam?

192
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,898
Hae-e moved her finger?

193
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:14,817
That's a good sign, right?

194
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,236
It means she could wake up, right?

195
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:20,990
I'm so relieved.

196
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,074
Okay.

197
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,868
Bye.

198
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,163
I haven't seen Seong-hyeon in ages.

199
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,583
Almost never since that incident.

200
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:36,297
By the way, one of my classmates
recently said in our group chat

201
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:40,426
that he'd seen someone
who looked awfully like him.

202
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:46,390
Yes, I'm sure it was Seong-hyeon.

203
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:49,185
I'm positive.

204
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:52,813
He's much slimmer now
and doesn't wear glasses anymore,

205
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:56,150
but how could I ever forget his face?

206
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,986
I was pretty shocked back then.

207
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,614
But he denied it?

208
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,949
Yes. He was adamant
that I got the wrong person.

209
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,952
What was he doing at the studio?

210
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,748
A famous star teacher
had a photo shoot here.

211
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:13,083
He seemed like his assistant.

212
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,086
What was the teacher's name?

213
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:18,589
I don't know much about education.

214
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,383
Choi…

215
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,760
Choi Chi-yeol, maybe?

216
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,178
"Choi Chi-yeol"?

217
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:29,433
What brings you here?

218
00:13:29,517 --> 00:13:30,518
Well…

219
00:13:31,101 --> 00:13:33,020
We keep finding reasons to come back here.

220
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:37,942
-Goodbye then.
-Goodbye.

221
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,655
No wonder he looked so familiar.

222
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:05,427
DETECTIVE SONG I-TAE

223
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:53,309
One, two, seven, zero…

224
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:58,731
The number of possible permutations
of 4 elements is 24.

225
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:04,904
I might have a shot.

226
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,129
Hold on.

227
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,381
One, two, seven, zero.

228
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,260
Zero, two, one, seven.

229
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,306
My birthday?

230
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,439
"Jeong Su-hyeon."

231
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:09,778
JEONG SU-HYEON

232
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,572
Why is her diary…

233
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,584
Su-hyeon told me a lot about you.

234
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,463
I used to have the same exact pen.

235
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,799
Really? My sister gave me that.

236
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,302
Are you Jeong Seong-hyeon?

237
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:34,928
I think you got the wrong person.

238
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:07,920
DETECTIVE SONG I-TAE
MISSED CALLS

239
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,507
MS. JUNG, THE PRIDE

240
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,470
Hello, Ms. Jung.

241
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:17,721
Mr. Choi.

242
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,642
The meeting just ended,
and I need you to confirm something.

243
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,478
I called you
because Mr. Ji wasn't picking up.

244
00:18:24,561 --> 00:18:26,230
He didn't come to the meeting?

245
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,940
No, he didn't.

246
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:32,069
He just texted that something came up
and you couldn't come.

247
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,197
If you couldn't come,
he could've at least shown up instead.

248
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,241
At least that's what we thought.

249
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,576
And why would he tell me that over text--

250
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,370
Okay. I'll call you back.

251
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,587
A macchiato…

252
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,078
Get away from her!

253
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,793
I've had enough.

254
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,202
Are you okay?

255
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,953
I'm fine.

256
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,217
Jeong Seong-hyeon!

257
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,402
Why…

258
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,530
Why in the world…

259
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:23,949
"Why"?

260
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,703
You really don't know?

261
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,000
I wanted to protect you.

262
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,420
You were the only grown-up
that my sister and I trusted.

263
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,964
So I've been removing
every obstacle in your path.

264
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:40,924
No.

265
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:44,886
That wasn't for me.
Stop justifying yourself.

266
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:49,391
I'm sorry for all the misery
and abuse that you experienced.

267
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,770
But that doesn't justify your actions.
This is a crime.

268
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:56,982
So what?

269
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:01,445
We've been a good team.

270
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,450
Things would've stayed the same
if only that woman hadn't shown up.

271
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:09,077
Covering up all our problems.

272
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:13,749
Killing more people
without even a shred of guilt.

273
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,214
Turn yourself in.

274
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,261
-It's not too late--
-Why should I?

275
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:31,892
Why should I do that?

276
00:22:31,975 --> 00:22:33,143
For whose sake?

277
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,522
For Su-hyeon.

278
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,236
She wouldn't want to see you
living like this.

279
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,404
Shut up.

280
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,866
I know you've forgotten all about her.

281
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,953
You have no right to tell me what to do.

282
00:22:57,793 --> 00:22:58,960
It's all over.

283
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,422
I'll end it all.

284
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,009
Dong-hui, don't do that.

285
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,385
Dong-hui.

286
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,596
Dong-hui, please.

287
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,181
Don't do this, Dong-hui.

288
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,349
Dong-hui. Ji Dong-hui!

289
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,727
Please don't do this, Ji Dong-hui.

290
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,165
So this is how it ends.

291
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:41,169
I'll help you, Dong-hui, okay?

292
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:43,797
I'll help you, Dong-hui.

293
00:23:44,297 --> 00:23:46,550
I'll help you get back into the world.

294
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,592
Please, Dong-hui.

295
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,772
I have nothing more to protect.

296
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,360
I'm too tired.

297
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,517
Seong-hyeon.

298
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:41,646
Seong-hyeon.

299
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,817
Eat up, Seong-hyeon.

300
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,486
If Mom sees us, we're dead meat.

301
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,418
When I go to college,

302
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,546
do you think I can be
Mr. Choi's teaching assistant?

303
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:08,423
Why?

304
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:11,635
Why do you want to be his assistant?

305
00:25:12,552 --> 00:25:13,386
Just because.

306
00:25:16,556 --> 00:25:19,559
He's the only grown-up I can trust.

307
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,021
I want to protect him by his side.

308
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,116
Mr. Choi.

309
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:20,096
A murder suspect, Jeong,
jumped to his death from a hospital.

310
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,350
Jeong was a suspect
in the series of metal ball attacks

311
00:27:23,433 --> 00:27:26,019
that had taken place around Nokeun-ro

312
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,896
and was being chased by the police.

313
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:32,650
The metal ball attacks
injured or killed at least three people,

314
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,695
including Jeong's students and colleagues.

315
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:40,950
Jeong had also been infamously suspected
of murdering his mother ten years ago.

316
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,578
At the time, the prosecution claimed

317
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:47,791
that he had held a grudge against
his mother and murdered her

318
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:50,627
for abusing her children
due to her obsession with education.

319
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:53,713
An expert blames the excessive competition
in society and education

320
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,256
for this tragedy.

321
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,760
Goodness gracious.

322
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,889
Guess you truly never know
what goes on in a person's mind.

323
00:28:03,848 --> 00:28:06,601
But if the Trillion Won Man is that smart,

324
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,104
why couldn't he see through
someone so close to him?

325
00:28:10,063 --> 00:28:11,940
He put you and Hae-e in danger.

326
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,149
It gives me the creeps.

327
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:20,156
Come to think of it, I haven't seen
the Trillion Won Man in a while.

328
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,243
He used to come here day in, day out.

329
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,080
Is he still too shaken up?

330
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:54,023
NAM HAENG-SEON NOT HO NAM-SEON

331
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:09,164
THE AGE OF COFFEE IS OVER,
AND THE AGE OF GREEN TEA APPROACHES

332
00:29:27,474 --> 00:29:29,225
Mr. Choi, are you in there?

333
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:32,312
Please open the door.

334
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,399
Open up, or I'll break in--

335
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:13,645
I mean, aren't I the obviously pretty one?

336
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,316
How did Haeng-seon
get to date the Trillion Won Man?

337
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,361
She's one lucky brat.

338
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,740
I'm so envious.

339
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,326
Let's see here.

340
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,918
Hae-e.

341
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,088
Hae-e.

342
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,467
Hae-e.

343
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,845
She woke up. Where's the doctor?

344
00:30:47,887 --> 00:30:49,389
Doctor!

345
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,184
Doctor, you came at the right time.

346
00:30:53,685 --> 00:30:54,769
Please hurry up.

347
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:16,207
Hae-e.

348
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,134
Hae-e.

349
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:33,683
Mom.

350
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,978
Yes, it's your mom.

351
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,318
Do you recognize me?

352
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,961
You're stuck at home all day.

353
00:32:03,254 --> 00:32:04,923
Open your windows once in a while.

354
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,618
There you go. Good job.

355
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,079
Eat just a bit more.

356
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,291
I didn't think I could eat.

357
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,795
But I can.

358
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:45,213
See?

359
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,882
You need to fill your stomach
if you want to stay strong.

360
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,218
According to my mom.

361
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,057
I'm not sure if I deserve to stay strong.

362
00:32:58,434 --> 00:32:59,811
Throughout the questioning,

363
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,064
all I could say was…

364
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:07,568
"I didn't know. I had no idea."

365
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,698
You told me this yourself.

366
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,741
No one can read another person's mind.

367
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:16,661
Today is the last day

368
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:18,788
you'll blame yourself.

369
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,415
Okay?

370
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,141
Hi, Haeng-ja. What's up?

371
00:33:48,818 --> 00:33:49,861
Hae-e.

372
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,114
Mom.

373
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,868
Everything's okay now.

374
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,454
Now that you're awake.

375
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,880
Hae-e!

376
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:11,674
Uncle.

377
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:13,217
Hae-e!

378
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:21,267
Hi, Hae-e.

379
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:23,644
Hi.

380
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:27,523
I didn't think
I'd be able to talk to you again.

381
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,611
I didn't think
there'd be another Chicken Day.

382
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:38,826
Why were you asleep for so long?

383
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,455
I'm sorry, Uncle.

384
00:34:44,457 --> 00:34:45,750
I'm sorry, Mom.

385
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,252
Don't say that.

386
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,338
I'm sorry.

387
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,673
No, I'm sorry.

388
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,481
Good job, Nam Hae-e.

389
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,866
Why are you crying?

390
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,625
GANGHYEON UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

391
00:35:27,708 --> 00:35:29,794
Hae-e, have some of this.

392
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,463
You used to love peaches as a kid.

393
00:35:33,089 --> 00:35:36,008
These are extremely expensive,
but I got them for you.

394
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,176
Open up.

395
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,095
Is it too big?

396
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,222
Here, I cut it up.

397
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,808
Eat just a little for my sake.

398
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,773
-Mom.
-Yes?

399
00:35:50,857 --> 00:35:52,692
-I want some water.
-Okay.

400
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,778
I'll get it.

401
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:57,572
Leave it.

402
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,830
Let's see here. You must be thirsty.

403
00:36:06,414 --> 00:36:07,373
Here you go.

404
00:36:24,390 --> 00:36:25,433
Nam Hae-e!

405
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:27,643
-Hi.
-Hey!

406
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,855
Why would you scare me like that?
I hate you.

407
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,524
Are you okay now?

408
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,484
How's your head? Is it okay?

409
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,407
Do you know who I am?

410
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:45,870
You're Jang Dan-ji.

411
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:51,083
Your birthday is April 27th.
Your Myers-Briggs type is ESFP.

412
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,419
Your motto is, "Don't worry, be happy."

413
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,589
You're 172cm tall.
On an empty stomach, you weigh--

414
00:36:57,089 --> 00:36:57,965
I'm 170cm tall.

415
00:36:58,633 --> 00:36:59,759
-You weigh--
-Hae-e.

416
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,474
It's been a while, Seo Geon-hu.

417
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,938
You must be Hae-e's friends.

418
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,399
You're so handsome,

419
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,609
and you're so…

420
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,319
tall.

421
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,530
Thank you for coming.

422
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,574
Nice to meet you. I'm Hae-e's mom.

423
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:30,873
How's school?

424
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,584
What about Sun-jae?

425
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,796
Sun-jae, Hae-e woke up!

426
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:38,381
She's conscious now.

427
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:39,882
I'm on my way to see her.

428
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:41,425
NAM HAE-E

429
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,695
A doctor's note
and a certificate of hospitalization.

430
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:02,113
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

431
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:06,033
I was told to update
the attendance information by tomorrow.

432
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:07,785
-I see.
-Sorry for the short notice.

433
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,245
No problem.

434
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:12,957
Anyway, I'm so relieved
that Hae-e woke up.

435
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,458
I know. It's all thanks to you.

436
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:16,002
Thank you for everything.

437
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:17,795
You even visited her in the hospital.

438
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,046
It's no problem at all.

439
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,550
Is everything good
between you and Chi-yeol?

440
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,554
Yes, I think so.

441
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:31,350
The relationship between
you and Hae-e was a surprise,

442
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,227
but you and Chi-yeol?

443
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,062
I never even imagined it.

444
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,233
But after seeing you two
at the police station that day,

445
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:41,902
I was glad.

446
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,614
It seemed like Chi-yeol
was back to his college self.

447
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:48,409
He was such a kind-hearted guy.

448
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:50,703
I see.

449
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:57,293
Expel the student who cheated!

450
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,754
-Expel him!
-Expel him!

451
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:01,797
Everyone.

452
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:07,011
A serious crime has come to light.

453
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:10,765
And yet, the school
isn't punishing the student properly.

454
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,016
Is this fair?

455
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:13,642
-No!
-No!

456
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,938
Then who will compensate our kids,
who stayed up all night

457
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:19,982
studying honestly for their exams?

458
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:24,737
What about us parents,
who have been at our kids' beck and call?

459
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,739
-Right!
-Right!

460
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:28,491
Everyone, repeat after me.

461
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,911
-We ask the school!
-"We ask the school!"

462
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,662
To promise!

463
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,456
-"To promise!"
-"To promise!"

464
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,084
To expel the criminal!

465
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,754
-"To expel the criminal!"
-"To expel the criminal!"

466
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,839
-We ask the school!
-"We ask the school!"

467
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:46,550
To punish the criminal severely

468
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,261
and restore order in school!

469
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,680
-"Restore order in school!"
-"Restore order in school!"

470
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,766
-Restore order!
-Restore order!

471
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:55,643
What do you mean, a criminal?

472
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:59,939
The crime was committed
not by him but by his mom.

473
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:03,859
Then he should've submitted
his exam blank like Hae-e did.

474
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,030
He finished taking his exam
and even got first place.

475
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,534
That makes him an accomplice, doesn't it?

476
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:12,952
-You're right.
-I agree.

477
00:40:13,035 --> 00:40:17,331
Sure, Sun-jae wasn't brave enough
to tell the truth right at that moment.

478
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,792
But his mom started it all.

479
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,128
He must've been flustered.

480
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,382
Isn't it always the grown-ups
that push the kids to the brink?

481
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,135
Plus, he came clean in the end.

482
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,512
Otherwise, this would've remained buried.

483
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,014
We should thank him
for plucking up the courage,

484
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:35,891
forgive him, and defend him.

485
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:38,394
But you want him expelled?

486
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,690
-This is too cruel--
-Let me get this straight.

487
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,651
Are you saying
all crimes should be forgiven

488
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,279
as long as the criminal comes clean?

489
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:52,408
Wouldn't that pose a serious threat
to the public good?

490
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,910
-Exactly.
-"The public…"

491
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:57,163
You're doing this for the public good?

492
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:01,208
Are you not trying to eliminate
one of your kid's competitors?

493
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,293
What did you say?

494
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:06,714
I haven't been able to support my kid
as passionately as you all have.

495
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,549
Nor am I well-educated.

496
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,969
But I know this isn't right.

497
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,682
I'm sorry if I stepped over the line.

498
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,102
What did she say?

499
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:23,105
What does she even know?
I can't believe her.

500
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,982
But hold on.

501
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:28,194
She does have a point.

502
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,863
This would've been buried
if Sun-jae hadn't come clean.

503
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,742
I don't know what's right
and what's wrong anymore.

504
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:38,454
I was afraid Dan-ji would cut ties with me
if she found out I was here.

505
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:41,165
Let's call it a day.

506
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:43,918
-She's leaving?
-What's with her?

507
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:47,630
Unbelievable. What…

508
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,716
What do you want to do?
Should we call it a day?

509
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:07,191
LETTER OF WITHDRAWAL FROM SCHOOL

510
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,735
I'd like to pay.

511
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:11,779
One second, please.

512
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,909
Have you been working out lately?

513
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:20,371
You look very fit.

514
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:22,164
Does it show?

515
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:25,417
I've been building muscles
for a photo shoot.

516
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,878
I see. I knew it.

517
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:29,630
Gosh.

518
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:31,924
I'll throw some tofu in
for your protein intake.

519
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,634
Good luck.

520
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,886
You're giving me this for free? Thank you.

521
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,681
Sure. Are you paying with a card?

522
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:39,932
Yes.

523
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,352
Thank you.

524
00:42:43,435 --> 00:42:44,979
That'll be 21,000 won.

525
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:46,855
Okay.

526
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,030
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

527
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,992
-See you.
-Bye.

528
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,872
He doesn't look that fit.

529
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,960
He has narrow shoulders, a big head,
a turtle neck, and short legs.

530
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,546
What are you mumbling about?

531
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:12,798
You're not even the owner.

532
00:43:12,881 --> 00:43:14,633
Why would you give food away for free?

533
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,260
Hey.

534
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,845
I'm second-in-command here.

535
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,680
I think I have the right.

536
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,974
Why are you picking a fight?

537
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,726
I'm not.

538
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,437
-Hi, Mom. What's up?
-I'm not picking a fight.

539
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,105
Tomorrow?

540
00:43:28,689 --> 00:43:29,815
I'm free. Why?

541
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,111
Without asking me first?

542
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:37,656
I like to meet people naturally.
I hate blind dates.

543
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,408
Hold on.

544
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:41,452
Give me a second.

545
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,208
Blind dates are just not my thing.

546
00:43:49,793 --> 00:43:53,631
I want to get to know a guy
in a casual setting

547
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:56,133
where my character shows through.

548
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,427
What do you mean, "you never know"?

549
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:03,432
Fine, I get it.

550
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:07,519
If I don't like him,
I'll make a scene and leave right away.

551
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,482
I'm going.

552
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,443
What can I do? It's tomorrow.

553
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,863
Are you sure he's good-looking?

554
00:44:18,947 --> 00:44:19,990
Are you sure?

555
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,578
But I can't trust your standards.

556
00:44:30,584 --> 00:44:32,836
This is hilarious. It's insane.

557
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:34,838
What's with her?

558
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,387
-Mr. Choi!
-Hey.

559
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:43,013
Hi.

560
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,603
How are you feeling today?
Already back to your studies?

561
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:52,898
I'm feeling fine,
but I'm way behind in my studies.

562
00:44:52,981 --> 00:44:54,274
Don't worry about math.

563
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,111
I'll bring you up to speed
as soon as you get out.

564
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,154
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

565
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:00,989
-I have a question.
-Okay.

566
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:05,035
I heard that star teachers
make a ton of money.

567
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,748
I read about you online,
and you're known as the Trillion Won Man.

568
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:12,292
Where do you keep all that money?

569
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:15,796
In real estate? In gold?
Or in a Swiss bank?

570
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,881
It's not that I actually own
a trillion won.

571
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,383
I create that much value.

572
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:24,471
You don't own that much money?
That's a shame.

573
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,390
But you're still rich, right?

574
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,267
Come on, Haeng-ja.

575
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:30,394
What? It's important!

576
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:34,523
Hae-e, when you date a guy later,
look into his financial situation.

577
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,400
How much does he make? Is he in debt?

578
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,985
Does he own a house and a car? Is he--

579
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:41,196
I guess you didn't look into
my dad's financial situation.

580
00:45:41,947 --> 00:45:42,906
What?

581
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:45,451
It was a different story back then.

582
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,495
Yes?

583
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,624
I need to dress her wounds.

584
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:54,793
Only one of you can stay with her.

585
00:45:54,877 --> 00:45:55,836
I will.

586
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:57,421
I'm her mom.

587
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,520
What is it?

588
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,356
Why do you keep glancing at me?

589
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:21,320
I can't help but walk on eggshells.

590
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,618
I always expected it to happen.

591
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,661
She was going to show up one day.

592
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,997
She's shameless by nature.

593
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:36,543
Do you want to go rest in the lounge?

594
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,671
I'm sure you didn't get
much sleep last night.

595
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:40,672
Wow.

596
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,758
It's as if you were there.

597
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:51,308
Come here.

598
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,233
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

599
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:01,527
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

600
00:47:03,028 --> 00:47:04,029
I'll do it.

601
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:07,699
Let your mom do it.

602
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,868
Let me look after you for once.

603
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:11,411
Too late.

604
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,998
Why are you so cold?

605
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:20,546
Has Mr. Choi left?

606
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:23,006
No, he's still here.

607
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,467
But we have a surprise guest.

608
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:32,849
Sun-jae.

609
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:37,312
Oh, my.

610
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,275
Who are you? I don't think we've met.

611
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,110
You're so tall and handsome.

612
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,153
-How tall are you? 190cm?
-Let's go out.

613
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:46,446
I'll get you a soda.

614
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:47,656
I just had one.

615
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:00,711
You're here.

616
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:09,261
You don't look like your mom at all.

617
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:11,597
I agree.

618
00:48:13,473 --> 00:48:16,018
What is it? What took you so long?

619
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,020
Dan-ji and Geon-hu already visited.

620
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,814
Sorry.

621
00:48:22,107 --> 00:48:23,942
I wanted to come sooner,

622
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,569
but I couldn't.

623
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,282
How are you feeling?

624
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:32,743
I'm good.

625
00:48:32,826 --> 00:48:35,704
I finally caught up on the sleep
lost during the midterms.

626
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:36,747
I feel rested.

627
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,959
So you're back.

628
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,044
Of course.

629
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:49,509
Well…

630
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,178
Hae-e.

631
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:52,846
Yes?

632
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,473
I…

633
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,226
dropped out of school today.

634
00:48:59,394 --> 00:49:00,854
It's the right thing to do.

635
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:04,733
I want to take a break

636
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,819
and take the GED later.

637
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:15,911
Hey.

638
00:49:15,994 --> 00:49:18,830
School will be so boring without you.

639
00:49:18,914 --> 00:49:20,290
There will be no one to bully.

640
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,044
Call me whenever you're bored.

641
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:27,172
I'll be waiting on the edge of my seat.

642
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:31,510
That's a promise.

643
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,845
-Sure, you can--
-I'll call you every day.

644
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,515
I'll call you every day. Is that okay?

645
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:42,229
Anyway, great work, everyone.

646
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:45,357
You all held up the candles
and shouted the slogans until so late.

647
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:49,111
As a result, we achieved our goal.

648
00:49:49,194 --> 00:49:51,029
It's my treat today.

649
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,741
I came here with my husband once,
and the steak was amazing.

650
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:57,869
I'm not sure
if it's really our achievement.

651
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:01,123
It was Sun-jae's own decision
to drop out, wasn't it?

652
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:03,959
The point is, we got what we wanted.

653
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,460
Tomahto, tomato.

654
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:08,338
-No, it's tomato, tomahto.
-Goodness.

655
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,881
I guess you're right.

656
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,300
Whatever.

657
00:50:12,801 --> 00:50:15,512
Dan-ji found out I protested.

658
00:50:15,595 --> 00:50:17,597
She got so mad at me
for attacking her friend

659
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:20,517
that she's refusing to talk to me.

660
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:21,893
It's driving me nuts.

661
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:24,604
Why are you so scared
of your own daughter?

662
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,107
She'll come around soon.

663
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:30,110
-Hey.
-Why are you so late?

664
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,903
-Let's go in.
-Traffic is horrible.

665
00:50:32,988 --> 00:50:34,906
As if she isn't scared of her kid.

666
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:36,450
Hello.

667
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,994
-We have a reservation under Suaimdang.
-Right.

668
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,370
-Please come this way.
-Okay.

669
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:44,541
-Su-hui.
-Yes?

670
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:46,793
-Come here.
-What?

671
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,007
It's him, right?

672
00:50:52,674 --> 00:50:53,967
It's your husband, isn't it?

673
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:05,771
What are you doing?

674
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,230
Honey.

675
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:10,442
Honey, I can explain.

676
00:51:14,988 --> 00:51:16,364
It's not what you think it is.

677
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:22,579
-Goodness!
-Then what is it? Tell me.

678
00:51:22,662 --> 00:51:24,623
-Hold on!
-What is it?

679
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,750
-Come here.
-Hey.

680
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:28,168
-Hold on.
-Move.

681
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:29,211
-Move.
-Hey.

682
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:32,172
-What? How dare you…
-Hold on.

683
00:51:32,255 --> 00:51:33,381
Stop it.

684
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:34,549
You must be crazy.

685
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:37,427
You lunatic.

686
00:51:37,511 --> 00:51:39,763
-You crazy bastard.
-No!

687
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,598
Let go of his hair!

688
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:45,227
What? His hair? What do you care?

689
00:51:45,310 --> 00:51:46,311
-You jerk!
-Goodness.

690
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,438
Go stop her.

691
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:49,856
Hey!

692
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,317
-You crazy bastard!
-Su-hui!

693
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:56,238
How could you do this to me,
you piece of garbage?

694
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,697
How?

695
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,449
You have no idea.

696
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:02,244
The entire neighborhood
is talking about Su-a's mom.

697
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,789
She pulled her husband's hair
and beat him up

698
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,291
in broad daylight at a restaurant.

699
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,918
No wonder word traveled so fast.

700
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:14,256
Someone even took a video
and spread it online.

701
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:17,300
I think I saw it.
It was one of the most trending videos.

702
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,554
So she's your neighbor? Unbelievable.

703
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,430
How humiliating.

704
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:26,101
After going around all high and mighty,
calling herself Suaimdang.

705
00:52:26,184 --> 00:52:27,894
Still, sharing a video is too much.

706
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:30,355
I don't feel sorry
after what she did to you.

707
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:33,275
What goes around comes around.

708
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:36,528
What happened?
What did she do to Haeng-seon?

709
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:39,322
So you're going on a blind date today?

710
00:52:40,115 --> 00:52:41,575
Don't you prefer meeting men naturally?

711
00:52:41,658 --> 00:52:44,452
You always said blind dates
feel stiff and never work.

712
00:52:44,536 --> 00:52:45,996
I'll just think of it

713
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:48,915
as betting my chances on a lottery ticket.

714
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,294
Anyway, who did Hae-e go out with?

715
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:00,135
Hey.

716
00:53:01,094 --> 00:53:03,138
Did you drop out
to come see her every day?

717
00:53:04,222 --> 00:53:06,182
We need to coordinate our visits.

718
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:10,145
Your wheelchair-pushing skills
are improving by the day.

719
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,981
If you're upset, drop out too.

720
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:14,774
You little…

721
00:53:16,443 --> 00:53:17,527
Should I?

722
00:53:17,611 --> 00:53:20,030
Be quiet. Just keep pushing.

723
00:53:20,906 --> 00:53:21,990
-Okay.
-Yes, ma'am.

724
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,703
Geon-hu, how's the studying going
without me as your personal tutor?

725
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,748
It's terrible.

726
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:33,668
So I'm thinking of signing up
for an academy.

727
00:53:33,752 --> 00:53:35,921
Really? That's a great idea.

728
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:38,548
Right. You're still new to studying,

729
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,301
but once you get the basics down,
it should be possible.

730
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:43,219
You don't seem to be slow or anything.

731
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:46,681
Hey. You think I'm smart?

732
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:47,807
Hey.

733
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:50,060
She just means you're not stupid.

734
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,145
-Stop overreacting.
-What, you punk?

735
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,563
What?

736
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:55,065
Are you okay?

737
00:53:55,148 --> 00:53:56,441
I'll go get you some water.

738
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,776
Hurry up.

739
00:53:58,610 --> 00:53:59,819
I'm okay.

740
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,491
Cover yourself.

741
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,952
I'm good. It's okay.

742
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:13,708
Just a second.

743
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,615
Hey, give it here.

744
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,034
-I'll do it.
-Okay.

745
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:57,210
Why do you carry around a hair tie?

746
00:54:58,044 --> 00:54:59,379
You have short hair.

747
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:02,090
That's yours.

748
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:05,010
What?

749
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,386
I bought it for you.

750
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:10,432
You once said
your favorite hair tie broke.

751
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,334
Nam Hae-e.

752
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:40,628
Yes?

753
00:55:41,755 --> 00:55:42,922
To be honest…

754
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:48,303
I want to stop being friends with you.

755
00:55:50,138 --> 00:55:51,097
What?

756
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,310
I've had a crush on you…

757
00:55:57,145 --> 00:55:58,146
for a long time.

758
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,611
Will you go out with me?

759
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,328
Look at you, Lee Sun-jae.

760
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,332
Hey, Sun-jae.

761
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,417
"Will you go out with me?"

762
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:28,760
Hey, you've been hiding
your feelings all these years

763
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,470
only to get turned down like that?

764
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,139
Cheer up, Sun-jae.

765
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:36,643
You only got turned down once,
For me, it was about a dozen times.

766
00:56:36,726 --> 00:56:39,521
Hey, I didn't get turned down.
I was put on hold.

767
00:56:39,604 --> 00:56:41,648
She said she'll think about it
after the CSAT!

768
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,316
Hey.

769
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,152
Same difference, you idiot.

770
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,154
Get it together, Sun-jae. What's with you?

771
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:55,120
Hey, let's go to a coin karaoke
and sing a breakup song together.

772
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,164
Even if you cry,
I'll take it to the grave.

773
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,082
Hey.

774
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,960
Don't group me and you together.

775
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:03,461
-Look at you.
-I'm different!

776
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:05,171
No, you're just like me!

777
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,799
You asked her out like you were joking!

778
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,300
I was serious.

779
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:10,802
That's the problem.

780
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:43,334
Go back in. It's cold.

781
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:44,836
Okay. Good luck with your date.

782
00:57:44,919 --> 00:57:47,881
Don't drink too much
even if you don't like the guy.

783
00:57:47,964 --> 00:57:49,257
I won't.

784
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:51,426
Hey, about your sister…

785
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:54,053
How long is she going to stay?

786
00:57:54,137 --> 00:57:56,973
It doesn't look like
she's leaving anytime soon.

787
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,851
I hope she won't mooch off you.

788
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:01,019
I won't let her.

789
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:03,104
Don't worry and go on.

790
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:04,939
Okay.

791
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,733
I am going, but…

792
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,444
Whatever. I'll leave it to you.

793
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,571
Bye.

794
00:58:12,071 --> 00:58:12,989
Yeong-ju!

795
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:15,074
Good luck tonight.

796
00:58:49,943 --> 00:58:51,277
Why are you doing this?

797
00:58:52,111 --> 00:58:53,029
What do you mean?

798
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,697
You must've heard.

799
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,283
I'm sure I've become the talk of the town.

800
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:58,368
You heard, right?

801
00:58:58,993 --> 00:59:01,120
Just point a finger at me
like everyone else.

802
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:05,333
Don't pity me and hurt my pride.

803
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:08,503
Are you enjoying this?

804
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,630
Don't you hate me?

805
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:11,839
A little.

806
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:15,927
But you're my VIP customer.

807
00:59:20,473 --> 00:59:27,397
PAYMENT AND PRESCRIPTION PRINT-OUT

808
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:38,866
Where did Jae-woo go?

809
00:59:39,784 --> 00:59:41,911
I told him I had to leave early.

810
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:52,213
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

811
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:56,801
Hey, Nam Jae-woo. Where are you?

812
00:59:56,884 --> 00:59:59,137
Come over here right now, Yeong-ju.

813
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,306
That place we went to last time.

814
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,473
Hey, Jae-woo!

815
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,560
I'm late! What's going on?

816
01:00:15,236 --> 01:00:16,237
Hey.

817
01:00:17,363 --> 01:00:19,490
I told you I had plans!

818
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:22,243
What is it? Cut to the chase.

819
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,582
Spit it out. I have to get going soon.

820
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:28,916
Don't go.

821
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:30,877
What?

822
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,295
Don't go, Yeong-ju.

823
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:36,549
I've given it some thought…

824
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:40,970
and I like you.

825
01:00:42,013 --> 01:00:43,431
What?

826
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,266
I'm not sure if I like you

827
01:00:46,601 --> 01:00:49,312
in the same way I like Haeng-seon,
or if it's different.

828
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:55,360
But you keep bothering and worrying me.

829
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,278
I do?

830
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,405
And I hate that
you're going on a blind date.

831
01:01:07,622 --> 01:01:10,333
If I take a bite of this,
that means we're going out, right?

832
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:23,346
Hey!

833
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:25,139
What are you…

834
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,060
Hey, don't…

835
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,538
Want to sit next to me?

836
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:15,648
I like you, Yeong-ju.

837
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,115
I like you.

838
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:27,034
No, stop.

839
01:02:28,035 --> 01:02:30,121
Leave this kind of food to me from now on.

840
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,294
I like you, Yeong-ju!

841
01:02:39,964 --> 01:02:40,923
I like you too.

842
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,388
These seats are so comfy.

843
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:52,018
I wonder how much this car costs.
I bet it's super expensive.

844
01:02:53,728 --> 01:02:54,729
Mr. Choi.

845
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:57,356
You have other cars, right?

846
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:58,399
How many do you have?

847
01:02:58,483 --> 01:03:00,902
Do you drive a different car
every day as you like?

848
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,279
Well…

849
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:05,364
yes, depending on the situation.

850
01:03:05,448 --> 01:03:07,533
I knew it.

851
01:03:08,159 --> 01:03:11,662
Haeng-seon could really use a car
for her business.

852
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:13,623
I'm not telling you to buy her one.

853
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,041
It's just a suggestion.

854
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:16,417
Haeng-ja.

855
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:19,212
I really want to
since she goes grocery shopping,

856
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,214
but she won't let me even talk about it.

857
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,216
Why not?

858
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,092
Then can you buy a car for us

859
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,846
so I can use it
when Haeng-seon doesn't need it?

860
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,139
Come on!

861
01:03:31,265 --> 01:03:33,059
Stop spewing nonsense.

862
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:34,727
Why not?

863
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:38,231
You need to learn to swallow your pride.

864
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,526
It's rude to turn down a kind offer.

865
01:03:41,609 --> 01:03:43,444
-Right, Mr. Choi?
-Sure.

866
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:47,990
No, I mean…

867
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:52,620
What's that? Oh, my goodness.

868
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,467
WELCOME HOME, NAM HAE-E

869
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,803
-When did you prepare this?
-Mom, open the door.

870
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:10,763
Welcome home, Hae-e.

871
01:04:10,847 --> 01:04:12,807
-My goodness.
-Congratulations, Hae-e.

872
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:16,102
Thanks, Auntie Yeong-ju and Uncle.

873
01:04:16,185 --> 01:04:18,980
-Welcome back.
-This is corny.

874
01:04:19,063 --> 01:04:21,482
You guys tend to take things too far.

875
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,736
Thank you. You should go.
You'll be late for work.

876
01:04:25,820 --> 01:04:28,573
I'll come right after work.
Don't start the party without me.

877
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,616
-I'll be upset.
-What are we celebrating?

878
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,285
Hae-e coming home.

879
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:34,912
Let's have a small party after work.

880
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:36,873
Why would you have a small party?

881
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:40,084
Invite everyone
and throw a huge party instead.

882
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:43,462
-Mr. Choi could even afford a hotel--
-Thank you for the ride, Mr. Choi.

883
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:45,131
Thank you.

884
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,591
-See you later.
-Okay.

885
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:52,555
Nam Jae-woo.

886
01:04:54,974 --> 01:04:56,225
-Let's go in.
-Okay.

887
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:10,948
I've never been in here before.
So this is where you live.

888
01:05:11,032 --> 01:05:14,702
Hae-e, I cleaned your room
all day yesterday.

889
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:17,246
I even washed your bedding.
Aren't I the best?

890
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:19,290
Yes, you're the best. Thanks.

891
01:05:20,374 --> 01:05:22,877
There are only three rooms.
Where should I stay?

892
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,588
Stay in my room with me.
Hae-e studies until late.

893
01:05:25,671 --> 01:05:27,298
Heck no.

894
01:05:27,381 --> 01:05:29,592
I can't share a room with anyone.

895
01:05:29,675 --> 01:05:31,552
I'm sensitive, you know.

896
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,554
Staying in that hospital room was torture.

897
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:36,599
Then what do you suggest?
I can't share a room with Jae-woo.

898
01:05:36,682 --> 01:05:39,810
Why do you live in this tiny place
in the first place?

899
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:43,272
This place is cramped to begin with.

900
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:50,905
Do you want me to ask your boyfriend
to get you a penthouse?

901
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:53,074
Stay in my room. I'll sleep on the sofa.

902
01:05:53,866 --> 01:05:55,868
That sounds uncomfortable.

903
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:56,827
It's fine.

904
01:05:56,911 --> 01:06:00,456
Then I'll sleep on the sofa.
Haeng-ja, stay in my room.

905
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:03,250
Heck no.
Your room looks like a storage room.

906
01:06:03,918 --> 01:06:05,169
I'll change the sheets.

907
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:10,591
Gosh.

908
01:06:12,134 --> 01:06:14,845
-Everyone hates me.
-How are you so brazen?

909
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:18,265
What?

910
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,559
I just can't understand you.

911
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:21,477
How--

912
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,521
Hold on. I'm getting a call.

913
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,608
Excuse me. Hello?

914
01:06:31,862 --> 01:06:34,949
I was about to call you.
You're so impatient.

915
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,743
I think I found a way to get money.

916
01:06:38,619 --> 01:06:39,787
Yes.

917
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:42,581
There's this guy
who's smitten with my sibling.

918
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,126
What?

919
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,044
No, not my younger brother.

920
01:06:48,087 --> 01:06:49,380
My younger sister.

921
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:52,967
Yes, I think I can figure something out.

922
01:06:54,051 --> 01:06:56,846
Wait just a little longer.
I'll call you back. Bye.

923
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,097
Okay. Bye.

924
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,602
TRILLION WON MAN

925
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:12,028
Hello, Choi Chi-yeol speaking.

926
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:13,529
Hello, Mr. Choi.

927
01:07:13,612 --> 01:07:15,740
This is Hae-e's mom. Haeng-seon's sister.

928
01:07:16,824 --> 01:07:17,658
Yes.

929
01:07:18,325 --> 01:07:21,704
We might become family,
so it's okay for me to call you, right?

930
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:23,581
Sure, go ahead.

931
01:07:24,081 --> 01:07:25,666
I knew it.

932
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:28,335
Well…

933
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,923
The thing is, I have a favor to ask you,

934
01:07:33,007 --> 01:07:34,717
but I didn't get a chance earlier.

935
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:39,138
Haeng-seon can't know about this, okay?

936
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,183
Of course.

937
01:07:42,266 --> 01:07:43,642
Okay.

938
01:07:44,226 --> 01:07:47,646
I'm a straightforward person,
so here goes.

939
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:52,318
If you happen to have any
cash lying around,

940
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,779
which I'm sure you do,

941
01:07:54,862 --> 01:07:56,572
could you lend me some…

942
01:07:56,655 --> 01:07:57,948
Oh, my!

943
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,912
What are you doing?

944
01:08:04,121 --> 01:08:05,247
Have you lost your mind?

945
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:08,542
You were asking Mr. Choi for money.
I heard everything.

946
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,169
-I just--
-How could you do that

947
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,338
to your sister's boyfriend, of all people?

948
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:16,092
Don't you even have a conscience?

949
01:08:16,175 --> 01:08:19,678
It wasn't easy for me either.
I'm so pressed for money--

950
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:23,432
Even still, how do you think
this makes your sister look?

951
01:08:26,018 --> 01:08:27,978
Don't you feel the least bit guilty?

952
01:08:28,562 --> 01:08:31,524
She gave up sports and dating
because of me and Uncle.

953
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,567
She's been working from dawn till dusk

954
01:08:33,651 --> 01:08:35,152
for more than a decade.

955
01:08:36,529 --> 01:08:38,447
So where have you been all this time?

956
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,574
How could you show up out of nowhere

957
01:08:41,867 --> 01:08:43,494
and be such a nuisance?

958
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:48,332
Why do you have to make me
feel so miserable?

959
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:51,919
Why would you yell at me?

960
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:53,754
I haven't even borrowed any money yet.

961
01:08:58,717 --> 01:09:00,052
Ask him for money again,

962
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:03,681
and I'll kill myself.

963
01:09:08,853 --> 01:09:11,063
What, you brat? How dare you…

964
01:09:11,564 --> 01:09:13,107
That rude little brat.

965
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,902
I'm so scared.

966
01:09:18,070 --> 01:09:18,946
Gosh.

967
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:53,457
Hey, it's me.

968
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:55,292
You sound awful.

969
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,086
Were you crying?

970
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,633
I must've imagined
my mom showing up one day

971
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,844
at least a couple thousand times.

972
01:11:07,638 --> 01:11:08,889
I wanted to get even.

973
01:11:10,432 --> 01:11:12,977
I wanted to be extremely mean to her.

974
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:18,732
And then I wanted to accept her back,
pretending I had no other choice.

975
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:23,737
After all, she's my mom.

976
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,993
I've resented and missed her
all these years.

977
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,163
But now that she's here,

978
01:11:34,415 --> 01:11:35,582
I'm so upset.

979
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,044
Even if she abandoned me,

980
01:11:40,879 --> 01:11:44,008
I used to imagine her
to be a decent human being.

981
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:46,677
But I was wrong.

982
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:50,389
Why was I born out of someone like her?

983
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,230
We don't get to choose our parents.

984
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:00,899
All we can do is

985
01:12:01,692 --> 01:12:03,652
try to become better people than them.

986
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:10,993
I guess we should.

987
01:12:11,076 --> 01:12:14,288
Yes, we should.

988
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:32,306
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

989
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:53,827
Hey, come on in! We're ready.

990
01:12:53,911 --> 01:12:56,246
Here comes today's star.

991
01:12:56,330 --> 01:12:59,500
Hae-e, I blew up all these balloons.
I feel dizzy.

992
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:01,502
All right.

993
01:13:01,585 --> 01:13:03,545
Since everyone's here, let's get started.

994
01:13:03,629 --> 01:13:05,923
Let's celebrate Hae-e coming home!

995
01:13:07,424 --> 01:13:09,802
Come here. Have a seat.

996
01:13:11,512 --> 01:13:14,556
-Congratulations on coming home
-Congratulations on coming home

997
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,810
-Congratulations on coming home
-Congratulations on coming home

998
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:21,021
-Congratulations, dear Hae-e
-Congratulations, dear Hae-e

999
01:13:21,105 --> 01:13:23,941
-Congratulations on coming home
-Congratulations on coming home

1000
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:28,570
Make a wish.

1001
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:31,073
Make a wish and blow out the candles
before they melt.

1002
01:13:31,156 --> 01:13:32,991
It's not my birthday.

1003
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:44,336
-Great job!
-Well done!

1004
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:46,046
Thank you, everyone.

1005
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:50,008
You were making a wish for quite a while.
Can I ask what your wish is?

1006
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:53,137
-No, don't tell us. That'd jinx it.
-He's right.

1007
01:13:53,220 --> 01:13:54,638
She should keep it to herself.

1008
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:59,351
I prayed that my aunt and uncle
will live happily even when I'm gone.

1009
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:00,686
What are you talking about?

1010
01:14:02,271 --> 01:14:03,480
What do you mean?

1011
01:14:04,106 --> 01:14:04,982
Are you going somewhere?

1012
01:14:05,691 --> 01:14:07,234
Yes, I'll be gone, Uncle.

1013
01:14:09,987 --> 01:14:11,113
I'm going to…

1014
01:14:12,698 --> 01:14:13,907
live with Mom.

1015
01:14:19,580 --> 01:14:21,165
I'm following her to Japan.

1016
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:25,169
I want to try living there with her.

1017
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:01,663
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1018
01:15:02,247 --> 01:15:03,248
Hey, Nam Hae-e!

1019
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:05,626
Are you serious?

1020
01:15:05,709 --> 01:15:07,419
I'm your daughter, not Auntie's.

1021
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:09,838
What's there to discuss
when I want to live with my mom?

1022
01:15:09,922 --> 01:15:11,965
Will Hae-e not be living with us anymore?

1023
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:13,675
Want one, Uncle?

1024
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,888
How could you hurt me like this?

1025
01:15:17,971 --> 01:15:20,390
We've lived together
for more than a decade.

1026
01:15:22,351 --> 01:15:23,727
Let's take a walk.

1027
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:28,190
She's a smart kid.

1028
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:30,150
I'm sure she has her reasons.

1029
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,319
Just accept it for now.

1030
01:15:35,239 --> 01:15:40,244
