1
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:07,984
YOU AND I, THE UNION OF TWO UNIVERSES

3
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:09,402
FINALE

4
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,862
I'm following her to Japan.

5
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,823
I want to try living there with her.

6
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,785
By "her,"

7
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:19,454
do you mean me?

8
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,252
When?

9
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,837
When will you be leaving?

10
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:31,382
As soon as we can.

11
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,636
I can transfer schools if I bring

12
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,013
my academic transcript
and proof of enrollment.

13
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,767
I'm going to go as soon as possible.

14
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,101
I need time to adjust too.

15
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,147
I'll tell my teacher
when I go to school on Monday.

16
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,691
You're not taking the CSAT?

17
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,487
No. I'll be studying abroad anyway.

18
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:04,040
Let go of me. It hurts.

19
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,876
What are you talking about?

20
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,879
You're going to Japan with me?

21
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,131
What? Can I not?

22
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,425
Of course, you can.

23
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:16,594
But this isn't right. We didn't discuss--

24
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,012
Why do we need to discuss it?

25
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,306
I'm your daughter, not Auntie's.

26
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:23,518
What's there to discuss
when I want to live with my mom?

27
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,936
Isn't this normal?

28
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,272
That's not the issue right now.

29
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,108
How dare you talk back to your mom?

30
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:31,776
You must've been a handful.

31
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,530
Gosh, I'm so flustered
that my nose is sweating.

32
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:36,781
I'm going with you.

33
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,492
I've made my decision,
so book the plane tickets.

34
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,869
Don't ask Aunt for help.

35
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:42,871
-Hey…
-Whether we live in poverty

36
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,248
or work and earn money,
that's our issue to handle.

37
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,877
That's the least you can do
to thank her for raising me.

38
00:02:51,254 --> 00:02:52,255
Nam Hae-e.

39
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:57,594
If you don't listen to me,

40
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:01,222
I'll never see you again.

41
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:15,820
OUR BELOVED HAE-E!
CONGRATULATIONS ON COMING HOME

42
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,620
Haeng-seon, will Hae-e not be
living with us anymore?

43
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:25,872
Will she?

44
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,791
But why?

45
00:03:29,751 --> 00:03:31,502
Why is she leaving with Haeng-ja?

46
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,840
We've been living happily together,
so why does she want to leave?

47
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,267
Hae-e is so mean!

48
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,811
She's a traitor!

49
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,481
She's so mean!

50
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,195
Hey, Nam Hae-e!

51
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,782
Are you serious?

52
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,076
About leaving with Mom?

53
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:05,995
Yes, I am.

54
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:09,958
What's the matter with you?
I just don't understand.

55
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:13,920
Are you that happy
to be reunited with her again?

56
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:16,381
Is that why you're suddenly
dropping this bomb on us?

57
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,841
I guess so.

58
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,136
The CSAT is around the corner.
You wanted to go to med school.

59
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,013
What will you do in Japan?

60
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,516
You know your mom well. You'll struggle--

61
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:28,518
That's our business.

62
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,105
So let's end it at that.

63
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:36,651
Hey, Hae-e!

64
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,654
Jeez.

65
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,621
She's from that affair video.

66
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,539
That's her, right?

67
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:51,874
I think it is.

68
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,877
Look, she's got a brace on her hand.

69
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:57,005
She beat the crap out of him.

70
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:14,188
Why are you here?

71
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,942
How dare you come here?

72
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,404
Where else would I go? It's my house.

73
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:25,575
You're so brazen.
How can you be so shameless?

74
00:05:25,658 --> 00:05:29,120
This isn't your house anymore, so get out.

75
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,872
-Go.
-What's with you?

76
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,999
-You disgust me, so leave.
-Use your words.

77
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,918
You go straight to throwing hands.
So uncouth.

78
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,504
-"Uncouth"?
-You're quite violent.

79
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,381
Honestly…

80
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,759
Yes, it's my fault.

81
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:47,055
But hey, imagine how lonely
I must've been to do that.

82
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:49,599
I was so lonely!

83
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:52,852
You never treat me
like a decent human being.

84
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,063
Am I wrong?

85
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,149
You never cook me anything.

86
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:01,152
You're always attending
information sessions with other moms

87
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:03,654
or posting stuff on Sky.com or whatever.

88
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,698
Do I do all that for my sake?

89
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,659
I do it for Su-a's future--

90
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,495
Don't make me laugh!

91
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,707
You're living vicariously through her
to achieve what you couldn't.

92
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,960
Everything in your life is ordinary,
from your school to your husband.

93
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,005
You want her to become a doctor
for your sake.

94
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,882
You're just being vain, aren't you?

95
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,344
Fine, let's just say that's it. Sure.

96
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,179
Then what about you?

97
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:32,141
You're having an affair,
and with a woman from work, at that.

98
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:35,394
Do you know that the video has gone viral?

99
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,147
You're a bastard who deserves to die!

100
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,065
"Bastard"?

101
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,608
Are you trying to end things?

102
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:42,527
It's already over. Don't you know that?

103
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:44,946
There's nothing left between us.

104
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:48,491
If I could,
I would divorce you this instant.

105
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,661
But I'm going to wait

106
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:53,830
until Su-a gets into college.

107
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:57,375
So you better behave
and keep that affair on the down low.

108
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,129
If Su-a ever happens to see you

109
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:04,674
riding around with that woman
around our neighborhood,

110
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,008
then I'll really…

111
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,885
I swear

112
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,721
I'll rip you into pieces. Got that?

113
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,226
It's about college again?

114
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,730
You truly are unbelievable.
I'm crying tears of gratitude!

115
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:21,649
Shut up!

116
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:25,528
Just shut up! This is my final warning.

117
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,281
Listen.

118
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:31,200
Su-a…

119
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,456
is extremely sensitive these days.

120
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,710
If you dare create any situation
that might trouble her,

121
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,630
I'll show you how crazy I can be. Got it?

122
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:45,715
So?

123
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:49,010
Do you want us
to pretend like everything's fine?

124
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,180
Just for Su-a's admissions?
Act like everything's peachy?

125
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,474
Yes! Do that!

126
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,852
Do whatever it takes so she won't know!

127
00:07:57,935 --> 00:07:59,145
Do you understand?

128
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,483
Then what will we do
once she gets into college?

129
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,322
-I'm home.
-Hey.

130
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,740
You're home, Su-a.

131
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,784
Studying must've been stressful.
Good work, Su-a.

132
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:15,369
I'm hungry.

133
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,038
Are you? That's great.

134
00:08:17,121 --> 00:08:20,249
I bought your favorite cheese sticks.
I'll grill them for you.

135
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,250
Yes, do that.

136
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,544
Grill a few more for me
while you're at it.

137
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,546
Sure, of course.

138
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:46,651
MAN CAUGHT WHILE HAVING AN AFFAIR

139
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,487
-Hey.
-Hey.

140
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:09,173
That's enough. You'll rip the bag.

141
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,097
Do you want to walk?

142
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,602
Let's take a walk.

143
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,659
Have you spoken with Hae-e?

144
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,078
What did she say?

145
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:40,997
I don't know what she's thinking.

146
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:45,418
Gosh, I'm so confused about everything.

147
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,669
You must feel even worse.

148
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,298
While raising her,

149
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,926
I did expect something like this
to happen one day.

150
00:09:55,052 --> 00:09:57,263
But she just met her mom.

151
00:09:57,346 --> 00:09:59,849
And you've seen
how unreasonable Haeng-ja is.

152
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:02,351
What will Hae-e do with her
all the way in Japan?

153
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,188
You're worried about her even now?

154
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,356
You're not hurt?

155
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,150
I am.

156
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,610
She ripped my heart apart.

157
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,403
I can't believe she'd do this to us.

158
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,281
I doubt the reason she's leaving
is because she likes her mom.

159
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,449
So I just don't get it.

160
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,994
But she doesn't want to talk about it.
She's made up her mind.

161
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,079
Did she really say that?

162
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,415
She was so adamant.

163
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:26,167
So what could I say?

164
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:29,003
I have no say.
After all, I'm just her aunt.

165
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,881
She wants to go live with her mom.

166
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,928
Shall we sit down?

167
00:10:50,524 --> 00:10:52,234
She's a smart kid.

168
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,861
I'm sure she has her reasons.

169
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:57,114
Just accept it for now.

170
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:01,744
I have no choice.

171
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:07,708
The house will feel lonely
once Hae-e's gone.

172
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:10,002
Why don't you learn something new?

173
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,630
Piano? Or golf?

174
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,715
One of my friends is a golf coach.

175
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:17,385
To be honest,

176
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,180
once Hae-e went to college,

177
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:24,475
I was going to hand over the store
to Jae-woo and Yeong-ju

178
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,519
and study instead.

179
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,273
Study what?

180
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,030
I want to become a sports instructor.

181
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,658
I've always wanted to give it a try.

182
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:41,575
That's great.

183
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:43,661
That's awesome.

184
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,206
I knew you had a plan.

185
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:48,874
Give it a shot.

186
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,585
I'm not sure.
I'm not confident I'll do well.

187
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,212
And I'm terrible at studying.

188
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,131
I can't disagree with that.

189
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,593
But it's possible.
I'm speaking from experience.

190
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,262
Even the most hopeless students

191
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,556
can climb all the way to the top.

192
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:08,853
That's comforting to hear.

193
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:12,606
A Nam Haeng-seon who studies?

194
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,859
That's a whole new side of you.

195
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:18,779
-I'm falling in love all over again.
-What?

196
00:12:25,411 --> 00:12:27,079
Why are you staring at me?

197
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:33,586
Stop teasing me.

198
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:40,593
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

199
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,761
I'm so annoyed.

200
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,346
I don't know

201
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:47,600
why she wants to live with me.

202
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:52,646
She said she feels too ashamed
to face her aunt.

203
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,733
She doesn't want to be a nuisance.

204
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:57,985
What nuisance?

205
00:12:58,652 --> 00:12:59,904
You don't need to know.

206
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:05,826
She sure doesn't take after me.

207
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:10,664
She said she'd kill herself
if I ever asked them for money again.

208
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,042
Yes.

209
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,129
I don't know.

210
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:21,884
Let's just wait and see for now.

211
00:13:32,269 --> 00:13:33,312
Want one, Uncle?

212
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,152
-Haeng-seon.
-Yes?

213
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,321
I'll take a walk first,
then head to the store.

214
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,829
Try to understand.
He's just hurt and upset.

215
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,832
-I know.
-Let me do the laundry

216
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,961
and make you some porridge.
You need to eat bland food for now.

217
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:59,588
It's okay. My mom and I
can just order some porridge.

218
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:02,174
Don't order. It won't take long.

219
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,343
It's okay. You can go to work.

220
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,887
And leave our laundry out.

221
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,889
I can do her and my laundry.

222
00:14:13,769 --> 00:14:15,521
Fine. Suit yourself.

223
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,121
We're here.

224
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:35,624
Good luck today, Su-a.

225
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,085
I'll pick you up on time.

226
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,213
You have back-to-back classes today,
so you'll be hungry.

227
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,300
Grab a snack from the convenience store
during the break, okay?

228
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,345
Mom.

229
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:49,722
Yes, what is it?

230
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,849
Get a divorce if you want.

231
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:53,058
I'll be fine.

232
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,103
What?

233
00:14:57,688 --> 00:15:00,274
Just divorce Dad. I don't mind.

234
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,860
And don't pick me up later.

235
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,070
I'm going to walk.
I could use the exercise.

236
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,680
Stop!

237
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,642
Su-a?

238
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,436
Glad to run into you here.

239
00:15:52,701 --> 00:15:54,578
Studying by myself was too tough.

240
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,830
That's why I'm here at the academy.

241
00:15:57,414 --> 00:15:59,792
Do I enroll on the fourth floor?

242
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,421
-No, it's on the third floor.
-Canceled.

243
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,717
3RD FLOOR, COUNSELING ROOM

244
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,262
How kind of you.

245
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,147
Thanks.

246
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,070
How many walks

247
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:31,073
has Jae-woo taken today?

248
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,950
He wasn't in the whole day.

249
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:39,832
But then again,
that's what he does when he's upset.

250
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:46,880
Hey, just say what's on your mind.

251
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,133
You can vent to me.

252
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,678
Or just wander outside like Jae-woo.

253
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:54,513
You're suffocating me.

254
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,769
What? Are you going out?

255
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,981
Can you take over for a few hours?
I'll be back before dinnertime.

256
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:05,691
Sure, go.

257
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,901
Go for a drive with Mr. Choi or something.

258
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,946
Haeng-ja, get ready to go out.
We need to go somewhere.

259
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,990
Hurry.

260
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,242
Why her? Where are you going?

261
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:16,994
Shopping.

262
00:17:18,328 --> 00:17:21,123
Why? Are you going to buy her something?

263
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,670
-Are you killing your enemy with kindness?
-Help her out.

264
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,634
I'm going for a walk.

265
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,521
I love shopping.

266
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:47,357
It sure smells wonderful in here.
Hi, new releases.

267
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,359
What's gotten into you? Shopping?

268
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,444
What will you buy me?

269
00:17:50,527 --> 00:17:51,820
A handbag? Clothes?

270
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:54,490
Heels?

271
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:56,408
I'm so excited.

272
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:02,790
I ran out of eye cream.
Which one should I pick?

273
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,124
Hello.

274
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,461
-May I help you?
-Yes, please.

275
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,797
I'm shopping for some skincare products.

276
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,467
For sensitive skin
with a lot of calming ingredients.

277
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,551
One minute.

278
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,636
Sure.

279
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:17,554
Hey.

280
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,515
I thought we were buying something for me.

281
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,727
Hae-e has sensitive skin,
so she can only use gentle products.

282
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,396
It takes ages for her acne to disappear.

283
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,483
I'd love to buy a lot before she leaves,
but they'll expire.

284
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,277
Remember her skin type.

285
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,737
All right.

286
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,949
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

287
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:40,410
This is our most popular product
for sensitive skin.

288
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,205
Would you like one?

289
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:45,916
I'm also looking for some gel cleanser.

290
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,543
-This way, please.
-Okay.

291
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,837
Can I get some eye cream?

292
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:52,881
A cheap one?

293
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:54,883
Just one.

294
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:57,761
So stingy.

295
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,931
Hi, guys.

296
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,100
-Hello.
-Hello.

297
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,686
Gosh, you sound so tired.

298
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,354
Are you exhausted?

299
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:08,772
-Yes.
-Yes.

300
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:10,440
I see.

301
00:19:10,524 --> 00:19:12,317
I understand.

302
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,236
You're exhausted

303
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,322
and getting anxious
now that it's almost time.

304
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,908
-Right.
-Right.

305
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:22,077
But this is only the beginning.

306
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,455
I can't help you keep a strong mentality.
That's your job.

307
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,791
Just take care of that,

308
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,585
and I'll take care of the rest.

309
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,544
Got it?

310
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,962
-Okay.
-Okay.

311
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:38,594
Okay, let's begin.
What are we studying today?

312
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:43,807
Are you seriously that tired?

313
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,267
The CSAT is around the corner.

314
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,020
All right.

315
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,564
I won't mention the CSAT again.

316
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,566
But that just means…

317
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:56,820
this grueling preparation
for college admissions

318
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:59,114
will come to an end soon.

319
00:20:04,828 --> 00:20:06,121
-What's wrong?
-She fainted.

320
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:08,790
What's the matter?

321
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,834
It's a side effect of medication.

322
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,253
Medication? What kind of medication?

323
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,798
There's this medication kids take
to help them concentrate better.

324
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,717
It's actually for ADHD.

325
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:23,513
But if you don't have ADHD,
apparently there can be side effects.

326
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:25,557
Why would they go that far?

327
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:26,642
Beats me.

328
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:30,020
It doesn't even seem that effective
in increasing concentration.

329
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,898
There's a high chance of it being
a placebo effect.

330
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,192
But they're just too anxious.

331
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,694
They're grasping at whatever they can.

332
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,536
Hey, Jong-ryeol.

333
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:50,082
You're right.
Kids nowadays do ridiculous things.

334
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,585
They consume highly-caffeinated
energy drinks and take pills.

335
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:57,172
We even sent out several announcements
asking them to cut down.

336
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:00,759
But a part of me understands them.

337
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,262
Studying means everything.

338
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,764
Their futures depend on the CSAT.

339
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:07,140
It must be so nerve-racking.

340
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:12,020
And I also play a part
in the game of chicken that is admissions.

341
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:15,023
I've made my living off of it.

342
00:21:17,109 --> 00:21:18,944
What's gotten into you?

343
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,445
All of a sudden?

344
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:22,030
I know.

345
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,907
What's gotten into me?

346
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,869
Don't be absurd.
That's your inflated ego talking.

347
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,747
The educational system
and the parents' mindsets are to blame.

348
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,500
A mere star teacher's guilt
won't fix anything.

349
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,254
"A mere star teacher"?

350
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:38,588
That hits home.

351
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:39,881
Don't be so disappointed.

352
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,926
I'm a mere school teacher as well.

353
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,475
I don't know what to think
about the admissions system.

354
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,895
My main worry nowadays is
the level at which I teach my classes.

355
00:21:54,938 --> 00:21:56,940
The students' academic levels
differ greatly.

356
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:00,277
I can't just focus on my top students.

357
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,321
But if I were to set the bar
to the average,

358
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:05,574
they would complain and say
they've already learned everything.

359
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:07,409
Then divide the classes into levels.

360
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,621
Sure, some will complain
about not making it to the top.

361
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,582
But that's the best solution.

362
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,585
That did come up before,

363
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,713
but I didn't like ranking them
based on their grades.

364
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:21,965
You shouldn't think of it that way.

365
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,343
There are certain kids
who belatedly decided to study hard.

366
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:27,637
Those kids need to learn the basics first.
You can't leave them behind.

367
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,014
That's the best solution.

368
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:37,022
Gosh, what a great teacher you are,
worrying about your students like that.

369
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:41,568
You're being a snob again.

370
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,028
You were always like that.

371
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:44,946
You were always a know-it-all

372
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:46,865
-who gave others advice.
-Jong-ryeol.

373
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:49,326
Quite a few of us
thought you were obnoxious.

374
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:51,870
I was just born with many gifts!

375
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:54,039
I'm so tired of it too.

376
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:55,957
I'm a star teacher to the bone.

377
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,877
-Can we get another bottle, please?
-Sure.

378
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,462
Lucky you.

379
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,841
Thank you.

380
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:07,344
This is good.

381
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:13,892
You're drinking well today.

382
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,823
Are you sleeping?

383
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:32,494
He did it again.

384
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,391
Don't make such a fuss.

385
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,476
It's not like she'll be alone.

386
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:59,563
Jeez, you always go overboard.

387
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:03,775
Hae-e often gets migraines.

388
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,861
Among all the medications,
this works best.

389
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:11,241
She has a weak stomach,
so she doesn't wear wired bras, and--

390
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,711
I'll ask her.

391
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,881
I'll do that.

392
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:29,759
I'll ask her and buy her the right ones.

393
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:31,845
Okay?

394
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,806
But she'll say she's fine.

395
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,766
What do you mean?

396
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,270
She'll say she's okay
so you won't have to spend money!

397
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,192
So just remember that.

398
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,035
What's all this?

399
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,206
They're things you normally use.

400
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,832
I got almost everything.

401
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,584
If you need anything else, I'll go--

402
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:04,294
Why would you buy all that?

403
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,714
What do you mean?
I know you can buy things there,

404
00:25:07,797 --> 00:25:09,007
but while you adjust--

405
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,468
I don't need these, so return them.

406
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,094
What are you…

407
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,513
Just take them.

408
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,057
I don't need them!

409
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,141
Nam Hae-e!

410
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,477
What's the matter with you?

411
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,315
Why are you being so sensitive
about your aunt buying you stuff?

412
00:25:25,398 --> 00:25:26,733
Can't you just appreciate it?

413
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:27,817
Then what about you?

414
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,112
Why don't you consider my feelings?

415
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,699
I said I don't need them.

416
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,788
I don't want them,
so why do you keep insisting?

417
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,752
How could you say that?

418
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,506
How could you hurt me like this?

419
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,342
We've lived together
for more than a decade.

420
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:54,511
I respect your choice
to live with your mom.

421
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:57,013
But how could you be so harsh
and try to cut me off?

422
00:25:57,097 --> 00:25:58,932
You keep saying, "My mom and I."

423
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:00,517
Do you have to be that rude?

424
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,060
Yes, I'm rude!

425
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,480
This is how I am.
Maybe you should've raised me better!

426
00:26:06,064 --> 00:26:06,898
You…

427
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:10,402
What a rude brat.

428
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:02,329
NAM HAE-E

429
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:22,849
I need to wash my hands…

430
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,107
I'm off to school.

431
00:28:59,779 --> 00:29:00,780
Uncle.

432
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,659
Aren't you going to say bye?
I'm finally going back to school.

433
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:08,455
Bye.

434
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,254
I'm off.

435
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,468
Why didn't she…

436
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,720
Jeez.

437
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:31,227
Haeng-ja.

438
00:29:31,311 --> 00:29:33,021
-Haeng-ja.
-What?

439
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,982
Give this to Hae-e.
Her stomach hurts if she skips breakfast.

440
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,984
-You can give it to her.
-No, you go.

441
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,778
-Give it to her. Hurry.
-All right.

442
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:41,738
-Go chase her.
-Hae-e!

443
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,540
Nam Hae-e.

444
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,376
Hae-e.

445
00:29:57,378 --> 00:29:59,005
Haeng-seon wants you to eat this.

446
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,715
Take it.

447
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,592
She said you'll have a sour stomach.

448
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,180
Go. You'll be late.

449
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,267
I'll tell the teacher
about going to Japan after school.

450
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:18,483
Nam Hae-e.

451
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,113
What was that?

452
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,200
What? No reason.

453
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,703
It's my first time
seeing my daughter go to school.

454
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,372
You look so pretty.

455
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,542
You look so gorgeous.
You must take after me.

456
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,669
You're pretty, and the uniform suits you.

457
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,338
You have long legs too.
Let me take one more.

458
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,842
Go. You'll be late.

459
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,636
Bye!

460
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,181
My daughter is so pretty!

461
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:54,143
Have a good day!

462
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:01,067
I acknowledge the fact
that the defendant impaired

463
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,444
the impartiality of public education

464
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:08,241
and hindered other hard-working students
from achieving their deserved grades.

465
00:31:08,324 --> 00:31:10,118
However, the damage was remedied

466
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:12,704
after the defendant's son
confessed to the crime.

467
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:17,750
Taking into consideration
how neither of them benefited from this,

468
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:22,839
and the defendant's confession
and heartfelt apology,

469
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:26,759
the defendant will be fined
ten million won.

470
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:33,683
COUNSEL, DEFENDANT

471
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,105
Don't make me defend you again.

472
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:40,857
Criminal cases aren't my specialty.

473
00:31:41,816 --> 00:31:43,985
Nevertheless,
we got the most ideal outcome.

474
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:48,781
That's because you confessed
and cooperated with the investigation.

475
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,158
I didn't do anything.

476
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,244
You were there for me.

477
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,081
What?

478
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,626
Nothing.

479
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:02,837
Do you want to eat at home?

480
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:07,550
With the boys.

481
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,513
Let's go.

482
00:32:41,668 --> 00:32:44,003
I didn't have much time
to prepare many side dishes.

483
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,174
Next time, I'll go buy some
from Haeng-seon's store.

484
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:51,302
That's like you.

485
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:53,429
You'd never cook.

486
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:57,475
I should only make promises
that I can keep.

487
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:30,425
Mom.

488
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,261
Does this mean you won't go to prison?

489
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:35,596
Yes.

490
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,808
But she won't be able
to work for some time.

491
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,184
She was suspended.

492
00:33:40,977 --> 00:33:42,186
You should take a break.

493
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,897
You've been working too hard until now.

494
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,069
I should.

495
00:33:53,823 --> 00:33:54,866
Hui-jae.

496
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,368
Would you like to go on a trip with me?

497
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,421
What's the matter?

498
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:15,261
Nam Hae-e!

499
00:34:16,637 --> 00:34:19,640
Welcome back, bestie! Come here!

500
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:23,603
I'm so happy to see you in school again!

501
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:25,438
That hurts.

502
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:26,981
-Sorry.
-I'm still recovering.

503
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,149
Sorry. Are you okay?

504
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:30,026
-I'm okay.
-Why is it so noisy?

505
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,030
Hae-e, welcome back

506
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,240
to Woorim High School.

507
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,035
How does it feel to be back?

508
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,495
It feels good.

509
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,373
I only realized how beautiful
our school was on my way here today.

510
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:48,419
Had I known sooner,
I would've taken many photos.

511
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,588
You can start now.

512
00:34:50,671 --> 00:34:52,799
We'll still be around for another year.

513
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,678
You're back, Hae-e.

514
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,306
Su-a.

515
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:03,184
It's been a while. Have you been well?

516
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,854
Not really.
It was boring without you here.

517
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:08,981
Right.

518
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,443
I took some notes for you
while you were gone.

519
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,654
Read them when you're bored.

520
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:21,369
What's gotten into her?

521
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,749
She's surprisingly kind.

522
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,418
Hey, what about me?

523
00:35:30,002 --> 00:35:32,046
-So are you.
-What about me?

524
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,089
You're kind too.

525
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,524
She's so pretty.

526
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,866
She grew up so well.

527
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,308
I enrolled in an academy.

528
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,978
I think it was called "The Fried."

529
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:33,149
Anyway, I'm in the beginner's class.
I'm going to give it a try.

530
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,817
Good for you.

531
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,735
That means

532
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:38,446
you won't need me anymore, right?

533
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,323
Of course, I still need you.

534
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,533
Even more so to study for the academy.

535
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,454
You better not abandon me.

536
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,882
Long time no see, homeroom rep.

537
00:36:59,008 --> 00:36:59,967
Hello.

538
00:37:01,344 --> 00:37:04,180
All right. This classroom
felt a bit empty without her here.

539
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,640
But now that she's back,

540
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,266
we can happily study now, right?

541
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:09,268
-Yes.
-Yes.

542
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:11,562
The finals are coming soon.
Turn to page 155.

543
00:37:21,530 --> 00:37:24,283
Hae-e, I'm sorry, and thank you.

544
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,577
See you again. From Mom.

545
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:40,424
WOORIM HIGH SCHOOL

546
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:42,885
"Woorim High School."

547
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:55,940
Dear Haeng-seon, my capable sister,

548
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,317
your shameless sister is leaving again.

549
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:01,946
Seeing you and Hae-e,

550
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:06,450
I felt a sense of shame
for the first time in my life.

551
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,830
That's right.
I'm leaving because I'm too humiliated.

552
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,125
Let me tell you in advance
in case you're worried.

553
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,670
I didn't steal anything this time. Really.

554
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:24,510
So no need to check
your bankbook or your jewelry.

555
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:28,723
But I did steal a few memories.

556
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,144
I took a few photos of Hae-e

557
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,647
from the album in your vanity.

558
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,527
I didn't even raise her,
but I still want to remember her.

559
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:47,491
I took the ugliest ones,
so don't resent me too much.

560
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:51,078
She'd only be embarrassed by them
had you kept them around,

561
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:52,496
so I'll keep them safe.

562
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:53,414
PHOTO ALBUM

563
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:55,791
Although I gave birth to her,

564
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,461
I realized that you were her mom.

565
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:02,256
Let's just consider her our daughter.

566
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:06,135
I'm being pretty generous
since I gave birth to her.

567
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,683
Once she's done with her CSAT,

568
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:16,145
visit Japan with your boyfriend.

569
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:18,022
Get first-class seats.

570
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:20,649
Don't be stupid
and let your pride get the better of you.

571
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,488
Most people might think
that you're the lucky one,

572
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,990
but in fact, it's him.

573
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,992
He'll never find another woman like you.

574
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,913
You did a terrific job raising your niece,
whom I abandoned.

575
00:39:33,996 --> 00:39:36,999
You didn't even kick me out
when I shamelessly came back.

576
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:41,087
No one else would be generous enough
to take her sister back like that.

577
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,341
I'm not brown-nosing you.
I truly mean it, you brat.

578
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,344
Let me know if Mr. Choi
ever breaks your heart.

579
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,640
If that ever happens, I'll show up
for you as a proper big sister.

580
00:39:55,684 --> 00:39:58,646
Until we meet again, goodbye.

581
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:31,637
Here.

582
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:33,806
I skimmed through it.

583
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,810
What kind of instructor asks
a school teacher to review his workbook?

584
00:40:37,893 --> 00:40:39,395
The kind that's before your eyes.

585
00:40:40,271 --> 00:40:43,357
Didn't you say you had
better grades than me back in school?

586
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,610
There weren't even that many questions,
so don't complain so much.

587
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:48,529
Just treat me to some drinks.

588
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,322
I was going to anyway.

589
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,369
Mr. Choi Chi-yeol?

590
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,631
Have you been well?

591
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,718
Yes.

592
00:41:12,845 --> 00:41:14,346
-And you, Hye-jeong?
-It's Hye-yeon.

593
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,764
Hye-yeon.

594
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,768
-Have you been well?
-No, I haven't.

595
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:22,646
I kept seeing articles about you online.

596
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:25,024
Once that settled down,
your ads would pop up.

597
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,985
Your face was on billboards and bus ads.

598
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,863
So how could I forget about you?

599
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:33,657
My academy is serious
when it comes to advertising.

600
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,825
Is she pretty?

601
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,204
Never mind. Don't answer that.

602
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:42,291
I feel offended either way.

603
00:41:47,296 --> 00:41:48,339
I'm going abroad.

604
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,008
It's not because of you.

605
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,677
I want to study music more in-depth.

606
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,306
That's incredible.

607
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,558
I'll be rooting for you.

608
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:02,478
You'll meet a great guy.

609
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,939
In that case, why didn't you date me?

610
00:42:05,814 --> 00:42:06,649
So upsetting.

611
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:26,085
Wild ginseng.

612
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:29,797
It's cultivated wild ginseng,
and it's six years old.

613
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,217
My mom got it as a gift,
and I took a piece.

614
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,844
You seem pretty lethargic these days.

615
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:38,806
But isn't it really bitter?

616
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:40,099
I've had it before.

617
00:42:40,182 --> 00:42:43,394
What's good for your body
is always bitter.

618
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,854
Eat it before Haeng-seon sees it.

619
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:48,816
Chew it.

620
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,776
Chew it.

621
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,612
You're so good.

622
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,781
-Gosh.
-Stop!

623
00:42:58,117 --> 00:42:59,159
Stop right there.

624
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:01,370
Don't you dare move.

625
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,998
It's sticking out.

626
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:05,541
I said don't…

627
00:43:16,677 --> 00:43:17,928
How long has it been?

628
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,265
Not that long.

629
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,310
About one week
before Hae-e was discharged.

630
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,644
Not one week. Three days.

631
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:27,062
Three days, he says.

632
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:33,402
They say the fire does not shine
on its own base. I'm speechless.

633
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,696
It's "beacon," not "fire."

634
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,032
Same difference, you sly punk.

635
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,952
Anyway, you're worse than him.
How could you keep this a secret--

636
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:47,416
But first,

637
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,294
what's your real intention?

638
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:54,173
Are your feelings for him even genuine?

639
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:56,967
Do you think this is all for fun? You…

640
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,093
How dare you?

641
00:43:58,761 --> 00:44:00,346
I get that you're flustered.

642
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,724
But don't look down on our feelings,
or we'll be offended.

643
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:06,977
"We"?

644
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,731
So you're serious?

645
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,232
You too, Jae-woo?

646
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,285
Hello.

647
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:24,745
Hello.

648
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:26,288
Well…

649
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:29,500
I came for some three-color namul
and braised tofu.

650
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,794
Three-color namul and braised tofu?
One minute.

651
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,381
Ms. Nam.

652
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:37,341
Yes?

653
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,260
Did you and Mr. Choi break up?

654
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,137
No. Why?

655
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:45,182
Because…

656
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,192
I don't know if I should tell you this.

657
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:58,404
No.

658
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,365
MESSAGE BOARD
CHOI CHI-YEOL'S NEW GIRLFRIEND

659
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,828
It's that lady from before.

660
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:08,288
She's pretty.

661
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:09,623
"Pretty"?

662
00:45:09,706 --> 00:45:13,377
She obviously went under the knife.
She got her eyes and nose done.

663
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,880
Don't you think she got
her jawline done too, Haeng-seon?

664
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,383
Hey, don't worry.

665
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:22,928
They weren't at some shady bar.
They met at a cafe.

666
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,099
They're not strangers, you know.
They could have some coffee.

667
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:29,435
Don't be so old-fashioned
and brood over it.

668
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:33,439
Everyone's saying
that she's his new girlfriend.

669
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:35,023
There are so many comments.

670
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,900
"He finally came to his senses."

671
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,694
"Side dish store lady got abandoned."

672
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,446
"New lady looks rich."

673
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:44,575
"He finally found someone on his level."

674
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,202
-"I approve of them. Be happy, Chi-yeol."
-Stop it.

675
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:50,372
Who are they to meddle
in someone else's relationship?

676
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:52,583
Jeez, people have nothing better to do.

677
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:55,586
Just consider this the price of fame.

678
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:59,965
Such scandals are normal
if you're dating a star.

679
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:02,676
You trust him, right?

680
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:03,677
Don't you?

681
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:06,763
I trust him. Is it just me?

682
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:08,765
Where are you going?

683
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:11,143
Don't tell me you're going to see him.

684
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,352
I'm going out.

685
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:16,482
Hear him out first.
Don't be rash or get mad at him first.

686
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,525
You won't hit him, right?

687
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:21,195
If you do, do it with your left
since you're right-handed.

688
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,697
You better behave.

689
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:33,290
This feels ominous.

690
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:36,418
That's the look she had on her face
before she quit handball.

691
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,798
Does this mean she's breaking up
with Brother-in-Law?

692
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,343
That's the worst-case scenario.

693
00:46:45,928 --> 00:46:49,681
By the way,
does she really look pretty to you?

694
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:50,766
Yes, she does.

695
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,227
But anyone would think

696
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:56,063
that a face like that was pretty.

697
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:58,065
Prettier than me?

698
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,691
Yes. Of course, she's prettier…

699
00:47:04,446 --> 00:47:05,572
What I mean is,

700
00:47:05,656 --> 00:47:08,116
the dictionary definition
of the word "pretty"

701
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,203
means aesthetically pleasing to the eye.
That's an objective…

702
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,039
That's an objective point of view.

703
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:18,043
But in my point of view, you're charming…

704
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,755
and charming.

705
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,007
It's not working, is it?

706
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:25,968
You're digging yourself in deeper, right?

707
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,024
I'm sorry, Yeong-ju.

708
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:44,695
Don't laugh like that. I'm sorry.

709
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,283
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be…

710
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,951
"She's so gorgeous."

711
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:52,953
"His relationship with side dish shop lady

712
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,454
-went longer than expected."
-Your call cannot…

713
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,915
"He finally found someone on his level."

714
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,875
"He's smiling from ear to ear."

715
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,336
-"He must be elated."
-Your call cannot be completed.

716
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,380
-You will be…
-These comments are no joke.

717
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:05,173
She'll be furious if she reads them.

718
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,509
Your call cannot be completed. You will…

719
00:48:08,093 --> 00:48:09,052
Is it still off?

720
00:48:09,136 --> 00:48:10,804
Yes, I think she turned it off.

721
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:14,725
-Your call cannot be completed…
-What do I do?

722
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,893
What do I…

723
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,313
-Your call cannot be completed…
-What do I do?

724
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:20,814
What will happen to me?

725
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:22,858
What should I do, Hyo-won?

726
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,027
What should we do?

727
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:28,822
-Mr. Choi.
-Yes?

728
00:48:28,905 --> 00:48:31,283
-Do you want to last with her?
-Of course.

729
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:34,244
Are you confident
that your love won't change?

730
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:36,371
Yes!

731
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,044
What is it?
I'm panicking, so just tell me.

732
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:47,382
Look at them. They're all so pretty.

733
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:50,135
I wanted to wait to propose
until after the CSAT.

734
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:52,054
Come on. This is an emergency.

735
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:54,556
We're in a dire situation.

736
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,933
I think this is your only way out.

737
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,646
You don't think
this would somehow anger her

738
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,564
or make the situation worse?

739
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,232
She's one of a kind, you see.

740
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:08,236
Mr. Choi, where's the charisma
that you exude during class?

741
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,073
You should be a man.

742
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,700
-"You're all I have."
-"You're all I have."

743
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,452
-"I'm all yours."
-"I'm all yours."

744
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,537
-"This is how I feel."
-"This is how I feel."

745
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,289
-"Don't feel pressured."
-"Don't feel pressured."

746
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:21,917
"I'm not asking you
to marry me right now."

747
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,337
"I wanted to express
my passionate love for you,

748
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:27,631
and this was the only way."

749
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:31,343
-I like that.
-Right?

750
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,637
Say that again. "I wanted to express

751
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,306
-Mr. Choi, pick a ring first.
-my passionate love…"

752
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,393
-Okay.
-Gold or diamond?

753
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:42,688
A gold ring

754
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,731
with diamonds.

755
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:47,943
Get out of there.

756
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:49,778
Why?

757
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,154
You don't work here.

758
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:53,699
How about this one?

759
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,793
Gosh, it's still off.

760
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,921
Where in the world did she run off to?

761
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:11,425
Why did you do that?
You should've been more careful.

762
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,511
She just wanted a cup of coffee.

763
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:16,638
And look what that one cup of coffee did.

764
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,557
You were thoughtless, Mr. Choi.

765
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,891
That's not true.

766
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:23,061
All he did was drink coffee
for 15 minutes.

767
00:50:23,145 --> 00:50:24,896
The people who took his photo

768
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,898
and wrote those comments are to blame.

769
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,775
So why should he be scolded?

770
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,027
Right? It's not my fault, is it?

771
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:32,446
No, it's not.

772
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:33,447
But still,

773
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,616
it's easy for small misunderstandings
to snowball into big conflicts.

774
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,535
But he let that happen.

775
00:50:38,618 --> 00:50:39,828
He should've drawn a line.

776
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:41,163
Exactly.

777
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:44,541
From what Haeng-seon told me,
you have a knack for drawing lines.

778
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:48,628
So I wonder why
you drew it so curvy this time.

779
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:50,672
Yes, why did you?

780
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,762
Right. I'm to blame.

781
00:50:57,804 --> 00:50:59,389
I should've been more…

782
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,184
She's here.

783
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,643
-She's here.
-She's here.

784
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:07,689
Hey, she's here.

785
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:10,692
What?

786
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,112
What are you doing here, Mr. Choi?

787
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,409
I was waiting since I couldn't reach you.

788
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:20,744
Right.

789
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,456
I went out in a hurry,
so I didn't check if it was charged.

790
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:25,665
It turned off.

791
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,543
-I'm going up first to study.
-Okay.

792
00:51:33,799 --> 00:51:36,051
I need to go to the convenience store.

793
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,056
Jae-woo, don't you need to go too?

794
00:51:55,237 --> 00:51:56,404
-Look--
-Look--

795
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:01,952
You can go first.

796
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:03,620
No, you can go first.

797
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:06,414
It was really a coincidence.
I was with Jong-ryeol.

798
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,334
She asked so nonchalantly
to have some coffee with me.

799
00:52:09,918 --> 00:52:10,752
I mean…

800
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,963
She said ten minutes,
and I couldn't refuse.

801
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,506
So we were there for 15 minutes.

802
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:17,342
It took five more minutes
because she mentioned going abroad.

803
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,594
I couldn't cut her off right there.

804
00:52:19,678 --> 00:52:22,764
Doesn't it look like
he's trying his best to explain himself?

805
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:27,310
I can't see her face
since she has her back to us.

806
00:52:27,394 --> 00:52:28,478
I'm so worried.

807
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:32,190
Me too. She didn't look that mad though.

808
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,070
When Haeng-seon's really furious,

809
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,196
she becomes calm.

810
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:42,409
Yes, she tends to be like that.

811
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,079
I hope the proposal works.

812
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,421
I knew someone could've taken a photo.

813
00:52:54,504 --> 00:52:57,090
I should've known from experience, but I…

814
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:00,927
I was caught off guard.
It's all my fault. I--

815
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:03,555
-Let's get married.
-Yes, let's get married.

816
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:05,932
Wait, what?

817
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:07,434
Let's get married.

818
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:10,687
Maybe not right away,

819
00:53:10,770 --> 00:53:13,315
but I realized that
I should let others know you're mine.

820
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,025
"Right."

821
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,986
"I'm dating a man
who is desired by all women."

822
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,822
"I let my guard down.
I was too complacent."

823
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,158
Haeng-seon.

824
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,911
That's right. I'm proposing to you.

825
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,914
For the rings,

826
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:32,042
I got 18K gold.

827
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:41,009
This isn't right.

828
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,428
What do you mean? Are you rejecting me?

829
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:45,305
No, that's not what I mean.

830
00:53:52,228 --> 00:53:53,563
I was going to do it first.

831
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:57,108
Goodness.

832
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,319
Unbelievable.

833
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:02,030
You're truly unpredictable.

834
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,866
How did you even think of proposing to me?

835
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,702
My rings don't hold a candle to yours.

836
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:11,456
Aren't these too expensive?

837
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,041
Who cares?

838
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:22,550
Sure.

839
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:29,724
Let's get married.

840
00:54:46,741 --> 00:54:47,909
After Hae-e's CSAT.

841
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,287
No.

842
00:54:52,288 --> 00:54:54,124
After Hae-e takes the CSAT

843
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,710
and I get
my sports instructor certification.

844
00:54:58,044 --> 00:55:00,296
All right. I'll help you.

845
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,260
Goodness.

846
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:10,724
So how did it go?

847
00:55:10,807 --> 00:55:12,392
-What?
-Tell me.

848
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:14,394
Let me see. Why do you have two rings?

849
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,730
She proposed to you too, right?

850
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:20,066
Congratulations, Brother-in-Law
and Haeng-seon!

851
00:55:25,238 --> 00:55:26,156
Congratulations!

852
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:28,366
Come on.

853
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,784
Don't cry.

854
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:31,745
I don't know what's wrong with me.

855
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:33,997
-Come on.
-What's wrong with me?

856
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:55,477
This academy district is still the mecca
of Korea's private education.

857
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:59,856
The upcoming CSAT for 2024 is in a month.

858
00:55:59,939 --> 00:56:03,610
In one month, the students' hard work
and preparation for the test

859
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:04,986
will finally come to an end.

860
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,241
The distance between the points is equal.

861
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:12,202
Then y is…

862
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:17,082
…log sub a(x).

863
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:19,626
But look. From this point,

864
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:24,214
you have to move this distance,
so what is the coordinate of p?

865
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,217
The coordinates are two and six.

866
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,301
That means a…

867
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:29,969
is the square root…

868
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:33,348
-of six.
-Those who will leave will leave.

869
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:36,726
Those left behind will pine for them.

870
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,480
GED CERTIFICATE

871
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,366
MOM
1 ATTACHED FILE

872
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,714
But time will still pass,

873
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:10,218
and that long-awaited day
will finally come.

874
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:12,512
2024 CSAT
SEOUL DISTRICT 10, EXAM SITE 4

875
00:57:32,574 --> 00:57:34,826
-What time is it?
-It's 3:30 p.m.!

876
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:37,745
You should've just gone with Hae-e.

877
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:39,747
You've asked over 100 times already.

878
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,832
It's her 112th time.

879
00:57:41,708 --> 00:57:43,835
Hae-e said, "You don't need to come."

880
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:46,963
And you were just as nonchalant and said,
"I wasn't planning to."

881
00:57:47,046 --> 00:57:49,090
Why couldn't you just go together
like other families?

882
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:52,760
Anyway, you and Hae-e are
a match made in heaven.

883
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:58,266
Darn it. I can't do this any longer.

884
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,809
And once again…

885
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:01,728
Su-a!

886
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,397
-Su-a!
-There's Min-gyeong.

887
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:05,690
I'm off.

888
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,066
Hae-e!

889
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,693
Nam Hae-e!

890
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,238
Mom!

891
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,623
Mom!

892
00:58:26,794 --> 00:58:30,006
My beam of sunlight runs toward me again.

893
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,258
Mom!

894
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,689
2 YEARS LATER

895
00:59:27,772 --> 00:59:29,357
Did you get that?

896
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:32,026
Let's look at problem 12 this time.

897
00:59:33,194 --> 00:59:36,197
Let's say the common difference
of arithmetic sequence a sub n

898
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:38,783
is d.

899
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:40,493
Then a sub ten minus a sub seven

900
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:43,288
is three d.

901
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:44,414
Then what's d?

902
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:46,916
It's two.

903
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:49,836
Now, we want to solve for a sub five.

904
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:53,631
You just need to move four units
from a sub one, so the answer is

905
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:55,633
fourteen.

906
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,926
Isn't it so easy?

907
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,428
-No.
-No.

908
00:59:58,511 --> 01:00:00,972
Jeez. This shouldn't be hard.

909
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:04,309
That's why I called you here today
so I can threaten you.

910
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:06,686
Then do you know the difference

911
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,688
between arithmetic
and geometric sequences?

912
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,064
-No.
-No.

913
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,816
That's fine. It's really easy.

914
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:14,485
An arithmetic sequence
is when the difference is constant.

915
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:18,656
Five, seven, nine. Like this.

916
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:21,034
A geometric sequence
is when the ratio is constant.

917
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:22,118
One…

918
01:00:23,077 --> 01:00:25,872
Like this. Did you get it? That's it.

919
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:29,250
-Can you show us your signature move?
-Why?

920
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:31,294
I came here from Cheongju to see it.

921
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,515
I don't want to do it anymore.

922
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:46,893
-Please!
-Please!

923
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:48,645
Show us!

924
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:53,149
-Show us!
-Show us!

925
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,662
So you two

926
01:01:05,745 --> 01:01:09,040
just registered your marriage
without having a wedding?

927
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:11,042
I don't want to wear a dress
with my belly.

928
01:01:12,418 --> 01:01:14,170
I'll give birth and lose weight first.

929
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:15,922
Excuse me.

930
01:01:17,548 --> 01:01:18,549
Again?

931
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:22,428
You were nauseous all day yesterday
and couldn't eat.

932
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:25,390
Goodness, the morning sickness
must be rough.

933
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,937
By the way,

934
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,189
you're quite talented.

935
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:35,650
Talented at what?

936
01:01:36,192 --> 01:01:39,904
What I mean is that you're…

937
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,239
You know…

938
01:01:42,573 --> 01:01:43,950
Well…

939
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,868
Never mind.

940
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:51,332
By the way,
I haven't seen Ms. Nam in ages.

941
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,209
She's busy studying.

942
01:01:53,292 --> 01:01:55,753
Has she still not gotten that certificate?

943
01:01:56,337 --> 01:01:58,881
It's not even the civil service exam.
How has she failed so often?

944
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:00,550
I would've done a better job.

945
01:02:00,633 --> 01:02:02,552
Anyway, I'd like to check out.

946
01:02:02,635 --> 01:02:03,469
Talented at what?

947
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,222
Well…

948
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:10,309
-Can you ring this up?
-Okay.

949
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,447
SOCIAL FUNCTIONS OF SPORTS

950
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,078
"It contributes to society."

951
01:02:29,162 --> 01:02:30,288
"It stabilizes society."

952
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,498
YOU CAN DO IT!
LET'S GO, STAR SPORTS INSTRUCTOR!

953
01:02:57,064 --> 01:02:58,649
My heart used to break

954
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:01,861
when I saw students eating
junk food at convenience stores.

955
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:05,198
I believed homecooked meals
were healthier.

956
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:07,450
But it turns out I was wrong.

957
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:10,953
You need to consume food
that contains MSG when you're studying

958
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,497
to create amylase.

959
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,083
Did you mean "adrenaline"?

960
01:03:16,167 --> 01:03:18,544
Yes, adrenaline. Anyway.

961
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,255
What I mean is you should study
while you're still young.

962
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:23,591
If you study later in life,
you'll suffer like me.

963
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:24,675
Okay?

964
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,386
So study hard. You can do it.

965
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:32,600
Don't forget we're having a party
before Geon-hu takes his CSAT.

966
01:03:32,683 --> 01:03:34,519
I know. I even bought some taffy.

967
01:03:35,019 --> 01:03:38,689
I hope he succeeds this time,
or we'll have to do this again next year.

968
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:39,816
I know.

969
01:03:39,899 --> 01:03:43,945
I hope both he and my mom
will pass their exams.

970
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,112
I hope so.

971
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,658
Right. Geon-hu said
he'll be bringing his new car today.

972
01:03:48,741 --> 01:03:50,326
He got a new car just before the CSAT?

973
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,285
Yes.

974
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:54,664
He said he needed one
since he studied until late.

975
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:55,581
But…

976
01:03:56,457 --> 01:03:57,750
-Seriously.
-There's Su-a.

977
01:03:57,834 --> 01:03:59,126
Su-a.

978
01:03:59,210 --> 01:04:03,005
-Hey.
-Hey, you're studying too hard.

979
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:04,215
You should take a break.

980
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:05,716
Once I start my med school classes,

981
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:08,469
I won't have time to study
what I'm interested in.

982
01:04:08,553 --> 01:04:09,971
Gosh, I knew it.

983
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,682
Spoken like the best student
to come out of The Pride.

984
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:17,812
Darn it. Why does my mom
keep selling me out like that?

985
01:04:18,604 --> 01:04:20,565
I'm so embarrassed.

986
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:23,192
COUNSELING ROOM

987
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:29,198
Gosh, I'm so disappointed in you.

988
01:04:29,907 --> 01:04:33,870
With a bit of help, your child
could easily get into med school.

989
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:35,913
Med school?

990
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:37,164
Yes.

991
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:39,125
Do you see that? Bang Su-a.

992
01:04:40,209 --> 01:04:41,043
My daughter.

993
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:43,379
Pre-med at Hanguk University.

994
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:47,383
She is the epitome of a student
who enrolled at our academy,

995
01:04:47,466 --> 01:04:50,344
attended the All Care Program,
and got into med school.

996
01:04:50,887 --> 01:04:53,514
I used to monitor her studies,

997
01:04:53,598 --> 01:04:55,725
so just trust me.

998
01:04:56,350 --> 01:04:58,728
But you see,

999
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:02,982
I'd like my daughter to become a judge.

1000
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,066
I see.

1001
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:07,570
I can help you with that as well.

1002
01:05:08,696 --> 01:05:11,616
A close friend of mine is a lawyer.

1003
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:15,453
We share many things in common
as working moms.

1004
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:17,330
I'll give her a call.

1005
01:05:19,874 --> 01:05:22,752
I don't know much
about law school these days.

1006
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:27,173
Sun-jae isn't interested in law school.

1007
01:05:27,256 --> 01:05:29,008
I don't plan on pushing him either.

1008
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:32,637
And stop mentioning me
during your consultations.

1009
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,305
Yes, I'm busy.

1010
01:05:35,014 --> 01:05:36,098
I'm hanging up.

1011
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:38,351
Jeez.

1012
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:41,479
Does she think that I'm her friend?

1013
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,606
How did the trial go?

1014
01:05:43,689 --> 01:05:47,568
Good. We need to summon
a new witness though.

1015
01:05:48,152 --> 01:05:50,780
-Could you get me the list of evidence?
-Yes, ma'am.

1016
01:05:53,908 --> 01:05:54,909
Come in.

1017
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:58,746
Salute.

1018
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,124
Hui-jae.

1019
01:06:03,376 --> 01:06:04,543
Are you on leave?

1020
01:06:06,879 --> 01:06:09,173
You should've called me first.

1021
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,008
Then it wouldn't have been a surprise.

1022
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,512
You look great.

1023
01:06:18,432 --> 01:06:20,518
-Please pass, Geon-hu!
-Please!

1024
01:06:20,601 --> 01:06:22,395
This is the last time we're doing this.

1025
01:06:22,478 --> 01:06:25,272
Fine, I'll pass this time around.

1026
01:06:27,608 --> 01:06:28,859
Gosh, this is good!

1027
01:06:28,943 --> 01:06:31,862
I was going to pass this time
since I was getting sick of this.

1028
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,364
-Jeez.
-Don't make me laugh.

1029
01:06:33,447 --> 01:06:36,242
Didn't you say
it was a privilege of your youth?

1030
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,828
-Please get in this time, okay?
-Yes, please.

1031
01:06:38,911 --> 01:06:40,913
-Don't tell me…
-What?

1032
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,540
Are you still waiting for me?

1033
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,294
-No wonder. Hear me out.
-Okay.

1034
01:06:47,378 --> 01:06:48,796
-After going to college,
-Okay.

1035
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:49,922
-she has never
-Okay.

1036
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:51,090
even dated once.

1037
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,009
-I see.
-I see.

1038
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,647
Su-a.

1039
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:08,899
Geon-hu.

1040
01:07:10,109 --> 01:07:11,193
Why are you here?

1041
01:07:11,277 --> 01:07:13,821
Visiting your school in advance.

1042
01:07:14,321 --> 01:07:15,573
I'm going to study here.

1043
01:07:17,825 --> 01:07:19,035
Hop in.

1044
01:07:19,118 --> 01:07:21,787
This is my mom's car.
I can't guarantee your safety though.

1045
01:07:25,374 --> 01:07:27,960
Then should I take the risk?

1046
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,213
I'm getting in.

1047
01:07:43,017 --> 01:07:44,018
Let's go.

1048
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,395
Thank you.

1049
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:55,780
Don't you have to return to school
and finish up your work?

1050
01:07:56,989 --> 01:07:58,074
I can do it at home.

1051
01:08:03,162 --> 01:08:06,582
This moment is more important to me
than my assignment.

1052
01:08:10,377 --> 01:08:12,171
It's about time you gave me an answer.

1053
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,216
You put me on hold until after the CSAT.

1054
01:08:16,592 --> 01:08:17,718
That was ages ago.

1055
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:21,597
I'm still thinking about it.

1056
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:25,518
How long will you take?

1057
01:08:26,268 --> 01:08:29,063
You'll get busier once you start
your med school courses.

1058
01:08:30,022 --> 01:08:31,524
I have my military service too.

1059
01:08:32,983 --> 01:08:34,610
You need to answer me so I…

1060
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,405
What?

1061
01:08:40,241 --> 01:08:41,408
What is it?

1062
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,966
Hey.

1063
01:08:58,008 --> 01:09:00,344
What was that?
What was the meaning behind that?

1064
01:09:01,470 --> 01:09:02,721
Do you seriously not know?

1065
01:09:03,514 --> 01:09:05,099
So we're going out?

1066
01:09:05,182 --> 01:09:07,393
-Come on.
-Nam Hae-e! I can't believe it!

1067
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:09,311
Let's hold hands.

1068
01:09:09,395 --> 01:09:10,729
-Let go.
-Why?

1069
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:13,858
-No way.
-Be quiet.

1070
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,068
-I'm just so happy.
-Be quiet!

1071
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,287
Did you study hard?

1072
01:09:26,370 --> 01:09:27,538
Totally.

1073
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:28,539
Totally?

1074
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:30,541
I feel nauseous from studying so hard.

1075
01:09:30,624 --> 01:09:31,792
Is that so?

1076
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:34,587
You studied hard.

1077
01:10:00,946 --> 01:10:03,490
Gosh, the exam is in two days.

1078
01:10:05,367 --> 01:10:06,452
How do you feel?

1079
01:10:06,535 --> 01:10:07,369
Great.

1080
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:10,247
I'm certain that I'll pass this time.

1081
01:10:11,081 --> 01:10:13,459
-Are you sure that you're certain?
-Totally.

1082
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:15,252
I memorized everything I read.

1083
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:17,504
So it's a definite pass.

1084
01:10:18,464 --> 01:10:21,008
I think you said the same thing last time.

1085
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:25,596
You're not failing on purpose
so you won't have to marry me, right?

1086
01:10:28,349 --> 01:10:30,267
Fine, I won't say that again. Sorry.

1087
01:10:31,268 --> 01:10:33,562
I just can't wrap my head around…

1088
01:10:33,646 --> 01:10:35,314
Sorry.

1089
01:10:38,901 --> 01:10:40,110
Should we go to my place?

1090
01:10:40,611 --> 01:10:41,487
No.

1091
01:10:41,987 --> 01:10:44,406
The exam is around the corner.
I can't exhaust myself.

1092
01:10:44,490 --> 01:10:45,491
Jeez.

1093
01:10:46,992 --> 01:10:49,119
We'll just hold hands and sleep.

1094
01:10:49,203 --> 01:10:51,038
What do you take me for?

1095
01:10:51,997 --> 01:10:54,083
Are you sure we'll just hold hands?

1096
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:58,254
Are you sure that you're sure?

1097
01:10:59,755 --> 01:11:01,131
Are you?

1098
01:11:04,385 --> 01:11:05,552
I'll drop you off.

1099
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,148
So the equation is….

1100
01:11:18,899 --> 01:11:21,819
t squared minus seven t plus eight

1101
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:23,988
is zero.

1102
01:11:24,071 --> 01:11:25,948
The sum will be…

1103
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:30,160
Taking the square and the coefficient
into consideration, seven…

1104
01:11:30,244 --> 01:11:31,704
It's almost time.

1105
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:36,834
No, we need to solve for x.
In order to get the sum,

1106
01:11:36,917 --> 01:11:39,461
you need to substitute and multiply…

1107
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:43,007
No, add… No, multiply.

1108
01:11:48,387 --> 01:11:49,513
Sorry, guys.

1109
01:11:49,596 --> 01:11:53,100
Today is an
extremely important day for me,

1110
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:55,311
so I'm having trouble talking.
Let's go again.

1111
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:58,522
To solve for x, we need to multiply…

1112
01:12:03,402 --> 01:12:04,903
It's time. Check, Haeng-seon.

1113
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:12,494
It's more nerve-racking
than hearing back from colleges.

1114
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:14,413
Please…

1115
01:12:15,080 --> 01:12:16,332
Please…

1116
01:12:17,458 --> 01:12:20,002
-Please…
-Hold on.

1117
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:23,547
I'll check now.

1118
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:35,601
LOADING…

1119
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:36,852
That's it for today.

1120
01:12:36,935 --> 01:12:40,105
We'll begin derivatives next week.
Good work.

1121
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,691
You can ask my assistants
any questions. That's it.

1122
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:45,110
I'm Choi Chi-yeol.

1123
01:12:58,957 --> 01:12:59,958
Hey, it's me.

1124
01:13:02,002 --> 01:13:03,003
Where are you?

1125
01:13:04,963 --> 01:13:05,964
Okay.

1126
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:08,342
How did it go?

1127
01:13:10,636 --> 01:13:11,637
I see.

1128
01:13:13,347 --> 01:13:14,348
Really?

1129
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:16,517
Okay.

1130
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:18,185
Bye.

1131
01:13:29,071 --> 01:13:30,906
She passed!

1132
01:13:47,172 --> 01:13:48,966
Gosh, I'm so happy.

1133
01:13:50,134 --> 01:13:52,219
I won't have to pay the penalty this year.

1134
01:13:52,302 --> 01:13:53,303
What do you mean?

1135
01:13:53,929 --> 01:13:56,265
I had a wedding hall booked just in case.

1136
01:13:57,141 --> 01:14:00,310
I was worried about canceling it again.

1137
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:03,689
Gosh, well done. I'm so proud of you.

1138
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,065
-Right?
-Yes.

1139
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:07,109
I'm surprised too.

1140
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:09,403
The questions were so easy.

1141
01:14:13,240 --> 01:14:14,908
People are watching.

1142
01:14:14,992 --> 01:14:16,201
So what?

1143
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:19,329
I don't care about any more scandals
since we're getting married.

1144
01:14:19,413 --> 01:14:20,998
You're right.

1145
01:14:22,958 --> 01:14:24,793
It's okay if there's a scandal about us.

1146
01:14:41,810 --> 01:14:44,354
Wait. Put me down.

1147
01:15:30,234 --> 01:15:32,236
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1148
01:15:56,093 --> 01:15:57,469
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

1149
01:16:42,306 --> 01:16:47,311
