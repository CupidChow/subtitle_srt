00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,006
It really is Mr. Choi.

3
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,008
Why did he stop here?

4
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,260
Is he getting side dishes?

5
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:35,887
At this hour?

6
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:36,846
Right?

7
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,431
The store's closed too.

8
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,643
That's strange.

9
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,354
This melon is so sweet.

10
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,648
Too bad I didn't get more.
They were on sale.

11
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,277
Isn't that Su-hui? What's she doing there?

12
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,284
Holy cow! What do I do?

13
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,245
My goodness.

14
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,003
Hi. I'm almost--

15
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,590
Don't say anything or look around.

16
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:15,218
Listen to me
as you casually walk toward my store.

17
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,845
What are you--

18
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,681
Don't ask questions! Just do as I say.

19
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,685
Su-hui…

20
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:26,563
I mean, Su-a's mom is watching you
from 20m away.

21
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,482
Don't look back! She's watching!

22
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:30,817
I said she's watching you.

23
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,404
Pretend you came here

24
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,739
to buy my food, but the store was closed.

25
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,242
Don't overdo it and keep it cool.

26
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:51,421
The store is closed already.

27
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:54,632
But I'm so hungry.

28
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,428
I'll just have to eat
whatever I have at home.

29
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:03,516
Mr. Ji, I'll call you back.

30
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,188
I said not to overdo it.

31
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,566
What?

32
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,486
I guess he didn't know
the store was closed.

33
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,863
He must've come to buy food.

34
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:19,240
So he was Hae-e's mom's customer?

35
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,576
I'm disappointed.

36
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:23,077
I know.

37
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,455
I expected him to have
a more sophisticated palate.

38
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:30,209
Let's go home. I have online classes.

39
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:31,878
Okay. Let's go.

40
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:34,422
I'll whip up a sandwich for you.

41
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,381
Okay.

42
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:48,353
Clear.

43
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:49,395
Okay.

44
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:58,404
-Your car?
-In front of the convenience store.

45
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,447
There was a spot.

46
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,700
-What? What is it?
-Wait.

47
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,205
A mosquito.

48
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,832
These ones leave you itching for days.

49
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,543
What's the matter with you?

50
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:15,213
I'm surprised
by how easily startled you are.

51
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,839
You must have weak energy.

52
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,299
That's not it at all.

53
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:20,468
As I said, I have an enormous influence--

54
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:22,053
Yes, I know.

55
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,471
You're a big shot.

56
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:25,265
That's why I acted so quickly.

57
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,725
Otherwise, you would've been
in big trouble.

58
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,353
She must've recognized my plate number.

59
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,563
Maybe I should get a new car.

60
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,691
You're selling your car?

61
00:04:35,233 --> 00:04:37,235
But that one's pretty new too.

62
00:04:37,318 --> 00:04:39,821
Why would I sell it?
I'd only get chump change.

63
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,322
I'll just get another one.

64
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:42,824
I see.

65
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:44,784
You can just get another one.

66
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,870
Just like how I can just go get
a few more melons.

67
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,275
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

68
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:24,282
THE VERY AVERAGE LAWS OF ATTRACTION

69
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,744
We will now be presenting awards
to the top scorers

70
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:29,662
in the September mock exam.

71
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,498
Grade 11, Class 1, Nam Hae-e.

72
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:39,505
"This award is presented in recognition
of the student's excellent achievements

73
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,884
in the mock exam held in September 2022."

74
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:45,595
"September 21, 2022."

75
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:48,347
"Principal of Woorim High School,
Choi Jeong-an."

76
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,936
This is the first time
you've come out on top in a mock exam.

77
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,146
Great job.

78
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:59,233
Guys, give it up for her!

79
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,736
She came out on top for the first time!
Give it up!

80
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:07,700
Nam Hae-e, that little munchkin.

81
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,541
Class 1, Bang Su-a.

82
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,214
We recognize your academic achievement.

83
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:25,259
You were the top student in June.
Keep up the good work.

84
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,470
Better luck next time.

85
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,935
Class 1, Lee Sun-jae.

86
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,481
We recognize your academic achievement.

87
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:47,657
Sun-jae.

88
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,117
Yes?

89
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,702
Just work on Language Arts
a little harder.

90
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,455
Make use of your excellent genes, okay?

91
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,416
Yes, ma'am.

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,918
All right.

93
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,754
Tell your mom that I'll call, will you?

94
00:07:06,551 --> 00:07:08,136
Congratulations, Hae-e.

95
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,266
Top of her class?

96
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,059
Really? Hae-e?

97
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,936
Yes, she's at the top of her class.

98
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:19,522
She's the only one
who got a perfect score in math.

99
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:20,690
Oh, my.

100
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:22,442
I didn't know that was possible.

101
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,318
She must be a genius!

102
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,445
This is incredible.

103
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,155
Jae-woo.

104
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,866
Can you slap my back?
This might be a dream.

105
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:33,286
It hurts, Yeong-ju.

106
00:07:33,369 --> 00:07:34,370
This isn't a dream.

107
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:37,665
Yes, it's happening for real, so be happy.

108
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:42,086
Yeong-ju, I never thought
good grades could make you happy,

109
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,589
but maybe that's because
I've never been at the top.

110
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:48,301
I'm so happy. I'm over the moon.

111
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,803
Hey, of course.

112
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:54,390
Olympism is all well and good,
but nothing beats winning a gold medal.

113
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:57,852
Mr. Choi is called a star teacher
for a reason.

114
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,772
A little tutoring from him,
and she gets a perfect score.

115
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,524
Exactly.

116
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:07,028
It's true that Hae-e worked hard,
but Chi-yeol's help has been crucial.

117
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,209
-Hello? Why did you--
-Mr. Choi!

118
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,630
Will you please keep it down?

119
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,840
Why are you so worked up?

120
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:30,885
Hae-e did it.

121
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:31,928
What do you mean?

122
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,679
The September mock.

123
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:37,850
She came out on top of her class
and had the only perfect score in math.

124
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,852
That's good to hear.

125
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:42,230
But no wonder. I'm her tutor.

126
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:43,523
You're right.

127
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,817
I used to think you were full of yourself,
but please go on.

128
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,195
You're truly the best. I respect you!

129
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,114
I'm not sure
if that's a compliment or not.

130
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,325
It's 100 percent a compliment.

131
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,869
Thank you.
I'll prepare a special treat for you.

132
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:57,995
You'll love it.

133
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:02,959
-My goodness.
-Yes!

134
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:04,502
Yes!

135
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,546
Nice.

136
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,674
Great job!

137
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,636
I'm not just saying this
because I'm your friend.

138
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,429
You're amazing.

139
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,599
Honestly, mock exams
haven't exactly been your forte.

140
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,936
But you improved your score
without even taking any private classes.

141
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:25,439
I lucked out. Many good guesses.

142
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,401
You studied hard. You can brag.

143
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,861
I'm going to tell my mom,

144
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,573
"You don't need private classes
to get good grades."

145
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,991
"Hae-e is living proof."

146
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,660
Maybe I should quit the academy

147
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,495
and be tutored by you, like Geon-hu.

148
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,913
Forget it.

149
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:44,041
He's never studied,
so I'm just giving him some direction.

150
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,001
Talking about me?

151
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,296
What about me? What did I do?

152
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:50,881
Nothing.

153
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,592
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

154
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,928
Right.

155
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,471
I wanted to ask you something.

156
00:09:58,306 --> 00:09:59,724
Hae-e,

157
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,350
why were you on TV earlier?

158
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,936
Hey, that's…

159
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,062
Gosh.

160
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:07,356
What? She wasn't?

161
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,899
No.

162
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:10,860
I must've been dreaming then.

163
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,781
Just eat up, okay?

164
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,701
Okay. You eat up too.

165
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,583
Here comes Su-a,
beaten by you in the September mock.

166
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,168
She looks awful.

167
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,385
Look at her stuffing her face.

168
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,762
She's losing it again.

169
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:40,139
She must be eating her feelings.

170
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:41,849
Maybe.

171
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,314
What's with her?

172
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,233
Is she acting out her envy or something?

173
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,532
It looks real.

174
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:10,127
-Oh, my.
-What's wrong?

175
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:14,256
Excuse me…

176
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:16,676
Su-a!

177
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,513
Su-a.

178
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,765
Are you okay?

179
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,517
Are you in pain?

180
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,352
Oh, my goodness. What do I do?

181
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,937
Are you okay, Su-a?

182
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:30,481
What happened?

183
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,942
Why did you
suddenly have an upset stomach?

184
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,985
My goodness.

185
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:36,779
Look at your face.

186
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,573
You look completely pale.

187
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,119
Listen, Su-a.

188
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:46,080
This is why I told you
to cut back on those energy drinks.

189
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:48,916
You drink about
a dozen of them every night.

190
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:53,379
Your uncle had warned
that you might experience side effects.

191
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,924
Use your willpower
to stay focused instead.

192
00:11:57,591 --> 00:12:00,428
I'm so upset. This is terrible.

193
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,346
-She came out on top.
-What?

194
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,472
Nam Hae-e.

195
00:12:04,765 --> 00:12:05,766
She did what?

196
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:08,978
The September mock.

197
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:12,356
She came out on top of our class.

198
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,830
Su-a.

199
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,541
Why don't you take
the rest of the day off?

200
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,251
We can still pick up the class materials.

201
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:40,843
But if you do that,
you'll fall behind, right?

202
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,553
It'll be tough to catch up later.

203
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:45,681
Fine.

204
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:47,933
Just hang in there a little longer, okay?

205
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:52,980
Who cares if she came out on top
in the mock exam?

206
00:12:53,063 --> 00:12:55,483
You have a much better track record
than she does.

207
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:59,403
You can take her place
in the next exam, right?

208
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:11,624
You can call me
if you want to come home early.

209
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,210
I'll be waiting at a cafe nearby.

210
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,253
Got it?

211
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,259
Unbelievable.

212
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,094
Hae-e came out on top?

213
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,849
And I have to pretend not to care
in front of Su-a. So annoying.

214
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,977
Ms. Jang,
then I'll sort that out as you said.

215
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,103
Yes, please.

216
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,734
Hello? What is it?

217
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,152
Ms. Jang, did you know?

218
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,447
Sun-jae shared
All Care materials with Hae-e.

219
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,658
I guess you didn't.

220
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,868
You should keep a closer eye on him.

221
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,622
This isn't just about the materials.
I'm concerned.

222
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,624
You know how these things go.

223
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:57,878
Two top students at Seonil High School
started going out together.

224
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,881
In the next exam,
the boy's grades took a nosedive

225
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:04,134
while the girl came out on top.

226
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,303
-I'm not saying Sun-jae--
-Don't worry.

227
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,973
I can take care of my son.

228
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,285
Hi, Mom.

229
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,327
Hey.

230
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,831
Did you really give Hae-e
the All Care Program's material?

231
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,207
Have you gone insane?

232
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,126
Have you?

233
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,628
-It's not like that.
-Cut it out.

234
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,881
Su-a's mom just called me,
all high and mighty.

235
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,595
I mean, why?
Didn't I ask you not to do that?

236
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,179
Answer me, Sun-jae.

237
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:51,849
All right, fine.

238
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,393
If you can't do it, I'll do it.

239
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,103
I'll go tell her mom

240
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,564
she shouldn't teach her kid
to leech off of others.

241
00:14:58,647 --> 00:14:59,523
How's that sound?

242
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:00,608
Don't you dare.

243
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,568
Or I won't see you again.

244
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,861
Sun-jae.

245
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:04,862
Lee Sun-jae!

246
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,498
Ms. Jang.

247
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,044
The clients would like
to push the meeting back an hour.

248
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:24,006
Sure. We can do that.

249
00:15:57,706 --> 00:16:00,626
You're not seeing anyone?
You're still young.

250
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,127
Why spend the holidays working?

251
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:08,342
Hey, either swallow it or spit it out.
Make up your mind.

252
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,219
-Detective Song.
-What?

253
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,138
I'm sure I've seen him before.

254
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:15,307
But I can't place him.

255
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:17,476
He's not wanted.

256
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,980
Black hoodie, hunched over,

257
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,065
eyes fixed on the ground…

258
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,274
I know I've seen him.

259
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,153
Gosh, it's hot.

260
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,116
It's so hot.

261
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:35,911
Hey, your ramyeon…

262
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:37,287
Hey!

263
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,748
What about our ramyeon?

264
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,090
Jeez.

265
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,137
Yes, that's him. I'm certain.

266
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,596
What are you talking about?

267
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,515
The Lee Young-min case. The metal ball.

268
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,600
There was this complaint
filed in the summer.

269
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,021
Someone was shooting metal balls
noisily every night.

270
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:03,647
Some stray cats got killed too.

271
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,899
When I went there to check,

272
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,569
a guy saw me and ran off right away.

273
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:10,696
I chased him but lost him in the end.

274
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,157
That was him.

275
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,284
The guy in black
across from Lee Young-min.

276
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:17,578
You can't see his face here,

277
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,747
but he has the same build.

278
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:25,794
3, NOKEUN-RO 17 BEON-GIL

279
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:26,712
See?

280
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,672
He followed Lee Young-min out right away.

281
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,261
Detective Bae,
I looked into what you told me about,

282
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:36,388
and one of our precincts recently received

283
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,391
a report about metal balls.

284
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,816
-It goes 3 over 4p, 5 over 4p, and so on.
-Okay.

285
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,278
When these are all natural numbers,
what else can we use?

286
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,156
-The range of a sub five.
-Correct.

287
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,911
In that case,
p can be one third and one eighth.

288
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,371
If you add those two up,
what will 120S be?

289
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,876
Are you done yet, Hae-e?

290
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,336
We'll be done soon.

291
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,677
How soon though?

292
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:16,762
In how many minutes?

293
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,972
We have two questions left,
so eight minutes.

294
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,140
Eight minutes?

295
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:21,683
Got it, Chi-yeol.

296
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:22,643
Please hurry up.

297
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:29,108
Does he make you uncomfortable?

298
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,527
Just a little.

299
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:34,404
He's been smitten with you
since we went camping.

300
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:35,948
He won't stop talking about you.

301
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:39,993
Since he only lives with women,
he must have wanted a brother figure.

302
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:40,994
I see.

303
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:45,415
Has your dad been away for long?

304
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:47,000
I heard he's abroad.

305
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,128
Well…

306
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,672
Yes, kind of.

307
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:54,133
I think we should hurry up.

308
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:55,801
Uncle Jae-woo's getting impatient.

309
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,261
Right.

310
00:18:58,428 --> 00:18:59,471
A party?

311
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:03,767
I'm good. It's not my cup of tea.

312
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:06,145
Come on. Join us.

313
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:07,855
It's my treat.

314
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:09,356
I'm good, really.

315
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,483
I find noisy
and crowded places detestable.

316
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,402
I won't even attend my own birthday party.

317
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,611
Make it a family affair.

318
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,155
But it's not.

319
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,240
Yeong-ju is waiting downstairs.

320
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,324
Join us, Chi-yeol.

321
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,909
-It's--
-Yes, join us!

322
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,911
We're celebrating Hae-e coming out on top.

323
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,622
As her teacher, of course,
you should be there.

324
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:28,125
I didn't even pack
dinner for you on purpose.

325
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,002
-Why--
-Will you please join us?

326
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,753
I even ordered some jokbal.

327
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,172
-I'm not a fan--
-From Hoy's?

328
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,757
Their jokbal tastes amazing.
You should try it.

329
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,050
I don't like jokbal.

330
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,927
See? Hae-e wants you to join us too.

331
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,762
I can't speak for me or Jae-woo,

332
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,807
but Hae-e never makes
unreasonable requests.

333
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,434
She must be so excited.

334
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,561
Come on. Don't use me as an excuse.

335
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,105
Come with us, Chi-yeol.

336
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,401
Come with us, Mr. Choi.

337
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,320
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

338
00:19:56,403 --> 00:19:57,571
You know the rules.

339
00:19:58,238 --> 00:19:59,615
It's a sin

340
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:01,325
to waste food.

341
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,993
You must finish your share.

342
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:03,952
Ready.

343
00:20:20,928 --> 00:20:22,054
Go.

344
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:31,146
Oh, my.

345
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,689
It's so good.

346
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,317
Dig in.

347
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,318
Okay.

348
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:38,528
It's delicious.

349
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,534
Well?

350
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,995
How about we make a toast?

351
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,373
Raise your drinks.

352
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:07,432
I would like to thank everyone
who came to this party.

353
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:12,354
Even though I never succeeded
in winning a gold medal,

354
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,189
my girl came out on top in her exam.

355
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:17,943
And this miracle wouldn't have happened
without Mr. Choi.

356
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,196
-Thank you so much and--
-Cheers.

357
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,532
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

358
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,333
It's so good.

359
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,257
Heck yes.

360
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:44,177
I shouldn't have gobbled up
so much jokbal.

361
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,305
I was too full to down it in one go.

362
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,181
-What are they doing?
-It's a downing match.

363
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,934
Last time,
Yeong-ju's record was 8.01 seconds,

364
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,394
and Haeng-seon's was 8.03.

365
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,021
So Yeong-ju won.

366
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,481
So far, they're tied at three to three.

367
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:57,858
Darn it.

368
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,777
This kind of competition is meaningless.

369
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:01,778
How foolish.

370
00:22:02,404 --> 00:22:04,823
Hey, Haeng-seon. I can't accept this.

371
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:06,616
Let's try something else.

372
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,618
You're being unreasonable.

373
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:11,163
Fine, as you wish.
I can beat you in anything.

374
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,123
Calm down, you two.

375
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,792
Don't forget Mr. Choi's with us today.

376
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,920
Then let's play a team game.
Your team versus mine.

377
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,173
That's fine with me.

378
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:22,883
But we're an odd number of people.

379
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,510
Should he sit out?

380
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,762
-"Sit out"?
-Come on.

381
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,055
That's no fun.

382
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:30,640
We'll just have to bring in
another person.

383
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,537
Chi-yeol, it's seven to zero!

384
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:58,502
Hey, what took you so long?

385
00:22:58,585 --> 00:22:59,669
What's going--

386
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,254
Why aren't you in the game yet?

387
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,673
Our team's outnumbered and struggling!

388
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,550
Hold on.

389
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,512
Didn't you say two men
could easily beat three women?

390
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:11,848
Hi, Mr. Ji.

391
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:14,851
Your skin looks even milkier
in the moonlight.

392
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:15,936
You look so elegant.

393
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,938
Should we switch up the teams?

394
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,981
It's boring to win every time.

395
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,942
No, I want to stay on Chi-yeol's team.

396
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,570
The teams can stay the same,
but let's play another game.

397
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,948
This was unfair in the first place.

398
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:29,783
That sounds good to me.

399
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,993
We can play basketball if you want.

400
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,037
Whatever.

401
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,209
What should we play?

402
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,503
Think of a game where hands aren't used.

403
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,089
They're former handball players,
so our hands won't do.

404
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,883
What about something like soccer?

405
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,261
-Or foot volleyball?
-Foot volleyball?

406
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,888
Sounds good. Let's play foot volleyball.

407
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,223
Sure.

408
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:57,269
Let's do this!

409
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,368
Yes!

410
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:15,537
Haeng-seon kicks too hard!

411
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:16,705
Yes!

412
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,124
Okay.

413
00:24:19,207 --> 00:24:20,625
All right, guys.

414
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,961
Stay calm. We're warmed up now.

415
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,379
Keep your eyes on the ball.

416
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:25,297
Chi-yeol.

417
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:30,886
Why are you giving it to me?

418
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:33,013
Give it to them.

419
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:36,975
Throw it.

420
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:39,895
Eyes on the ball. Focus!

421
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,193
Okay. Jae-woo, pass it to me.

422
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:47,152
Okay.

423
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:54,492
Yes! Nine to one!

424
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:55,493
-Yes!
-Nice!

425
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:57,537
I mean…

426
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,459
Look at you all happy.

427
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,754
A ball game was a bad idea.

428
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,964
-One more point to go!
-Yes!

429
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,550
Give us the ball!

430
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,730
Mr. Choi.

431
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,066
Mr. Choi.

432
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,485
Yes? What did I do?

433
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,819
-What?
-I mean…

434
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,155
What? What's wrong?

435
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,365
What did I do?

436
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,618
Are you okay?
You're pushing yourself too hard.

437
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,161
No, I'm fine.

438
00:25:38,245 --> 00:25:39,287
This is nothing.

439
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:41,539
See? I'm fine.

440
00:25:41,623 --> 00:25:43,375
Let's do this. Okay!

441
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:44,626
I'll serve!

442
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:45,919
You can do this!

443
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,340
Me?

444
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:55,303
Mr. Choi!

445
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,388
Yes?

446
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:01,518
I got it. Hae-e!

447
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:02,477
Hae-e.

448
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,359
Yeong-ju!

449
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,324
-Mr. Choi!
-Chi-yeol!

450
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,951
What happened?

451
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,788
-Are you hurt?
-Are you okay?

452
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:25,000
We need ice.

453
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,297
Hold this.

454
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,509
Goodness.

455
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,637
I'm okay.

456
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:39,472
Let me see.

457
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,816
Are you okay?

458
00:27:06,583 --> 00:27:07,709
Are you okay?

459
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,445
Let me see.

460
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,324
Are you okay?

461
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,835
Damn it. What the hell am I thinking?

462
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,713
I must have gone crazy.

463
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:57,634
She's married and the mother
of my student at that.

464
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:00,804
What's wrong with my heart?

465
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,141
I know it's the autonomic nervous system,
but this is way too autonomic.

466
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,687
Right, I played sports today.

467
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:14,192
I haven't moved like that in a while,
so I must've gotten an adrenaline rush.

468
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,945
With my sympathetic nervous system firing,

469
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:19,531
my autonomic nervous system
got out of control.

470
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:21,408
Yes, that can happen.

471
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:23,910
It just means I'm healthy.

472
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,912
No big deal.

473
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:28,456
-Sammy.
-Yes? Please go ahead.

474
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,417
To what extent
can the sympathetic nervous system

475
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,168
affect the autonomic nervous system?

476
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:35,213
I don't think I can answer that.

477
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,757
Can I help you with anything else?

478
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:45,974
Gosh, it never works.

479
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,351
Never once.

480
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:50,812
All right.

481
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,189
I should just sleep.

482
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,650
I'll be fine after a good night's sleep.

483
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,695
Once I get some rest,

484
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:02,198
my sympathetic nervous system
will return to normal,

485
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:06,578
and my emotions will calm down.

486
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:09,706
Relax.

487
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,293
Sammy, turn off the lights.

488
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,045
Okay, I'll turn off the lights for you.

489
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,882
Inner peace.

490
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,552
Relax.

491
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,980
Are you okay, Mr. Choi?

492
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,505
These are what the national teams
often use for pain.

493
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:42,799
Go see a doctor if the pain persists.

494
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,887
Then my heart started fluttering again.

495
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:32,181
That's when I figured
I should see a doctor.

496
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,475
This…

497
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:37,395
can't be happening!

498
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,688
Who am I?

499
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,983
I'm the Trillion Won Man,
the teacher on another level.

500
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:43,902
I pay more taxes than celebrities.

501
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,778
I'm the star teacher, Choi Chi-yeol.

502
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,239
So how could I develop

503
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:50,992
such inexplicable feelings
for a married woman?

504
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,076
Your heart flutters.

505
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,580
You also find her attractive.

506
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,011
So what's your diagnosis?

507
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,057
Doctor.

508
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:18,895
I'm not that kind of person.

509
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:23,775
I'm more rational, reasonable,
and moral than anyone else.

510
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:27,487
I find breaking the rules
and going astray detestable.

511
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,864
I'm too righteous for my own good.

512
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,326
So what's gotten into me?

513
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,580
Have I been too lonely?

514
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:40,249
Have I been too goal-oriented?

515
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,751
Am I starved for affection?

516
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:44,087
You have it all figured out.

517
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,713
Who's the doctor here?

518
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,591
So I'm right?

519
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:54,389
You rarely interact with anyone
but your students, Mr. Choi.

520
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,182
You're incredibly wary.

521
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,476
You never break out of your routine.

522
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,063
Humans…

523
00:33:03,523 --> 00:33:04,774
are lonely creatures.

524
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:09,320
So they emotionally depend
on those around them.

525
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:12,865
But you don't do that.

526
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:16,160
That's why you felt attracted to someone
in an unexpected situation.

527
00:33:18,287 --> 00:33:19,122
Out of the blue.

528
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,378
"Out of the blue"?

529
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,048
Then…

530
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:34,262
What am I supposed to do?

531
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:35,680
What do I do?

532
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:37,765
I'm not sure.

533
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:42,687
There's nothing wrong with your emotions,
so don't beat yourself up.

534
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,233
How about this?

535
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:49,986
Try something new.

536
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:53,156
Expand your social circle.

537
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,284
Break out of your routine
and meet new women.

538
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,578
Before you know it,

539
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,413
your unwelcome emotions

540
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,749
might die down.

541
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,395
The weather…

542
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,150
has gotten quite chilly.

543
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,568
What?

544
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:33,446
Well, yes, I guess.

545
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:34,530
Oh, my.

546
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:38,701
At this rate, it'll be CSAT season soon.

547
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,749
How are your class preparations going?

548
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,752
-Pretty well.
-Yes.

549
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:49,295
Let's go.

550
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:53,007
Mrs. Yoo, how was the honeymoon?

551
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,510
I'm sorry I missed your wedding.
My schedule was full.

552
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,220
I got divorced.

553
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:58,846
A year ago.

554
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:04,268
Time flies.

555
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,690
Let's grab a cup of coffee sometime.

556
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,691
Sure.

557
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,236
The elevator's here. See you.

558
00:35:13,319 --> 00:35:14,195
Bye.

559
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:17,448
Gosh.

560
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:20,118
I can't believe him.
He sure knows how to annoy people.

561
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,745
I know. What does he care
about our class preparations?

562
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,038
Is he teasing us or what?

563
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,665
So full of himself.

564
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:27,917
They only just got married.

565
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,544
Why couldn't they stay together?

566
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,631
Ms. Cho.

567
00:35:36,425 --> 00:35:38,719
-It's Jung, sir.
-Right, Ms. Jung.

568
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:43,099
About what you told me the last time…

569
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:45,351
-The schedule?
-Not that.

570
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:50,189
I mean your pianist friend
who's a fan of mine.

571
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,942
-You mean Hye-yeon!
-Hye-yeon?

572
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,278
-So that's her name.
-Yes.

573
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,697
Are you still willing
to set me up with her?

574
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,781
You want me to?

575
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,868
Yes, as long as she hasn't
gotten married in the meantime.

576
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,203
If she's divorced, that's fine too.

577
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,707
She's never been married.

578
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:10,209
She's going to go crazy
when she hears this.

579
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,836
She's amazing.

580
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,422
I think her grandfather
is a former government minister.

581
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,757
Anyway, she's incredible.

582
00:36:16,841 --> 00:36:18,551
She comes from a good family,
and most of all,

583
00:36:18,634 --> 00:36:21,637
she's really easygoing,
maybe thanks to her upbringing.

584
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,223
-You know--
-Then can you please set us up?

585
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,808
Sure. When is convenient for you?

586
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,728
Anytime. There's no rush,
but the sooner, the better.

587
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:30,938
Okay. I'll call her right now.

588
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,942
Are you sure about this?
Don't change your mind later.

589
00:36:35,026 --> 00:36:36,652
-I won't.
-Okay.

590
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:39,530
Mr. Choi.

591
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,240
You asked me to do this.

592
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:42,867
-Is that clear?
-Yes.

593
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,206
I'll do anything to get my autonomic
nervous system back to normal.

594
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,583
Anything at all.

595
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,265
What's gotten into you?

596
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:08,017
You bought that yourself?

597
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,353
I thought you were all for instant coffee.

598
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:11,729
I know.

599
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:15,024
I needed something
to wash all those waffles down.

600
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:17,985
It'll be a nice treat
for my customers too.

601
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,112
Hae-e tells me
making coffee at home is in lately.

602
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,785
-It smells nice.
-Right?

603
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:28,412
No more running to the cafe.
How convenient.

604
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,416
There's so much.

605
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,720
What's so funny all of a sudden?

606
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:48,391
Is it the coffee?

607
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,018
-No.
-Tell me what it is.

608
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:55,022
It's Mr. Choi. My goodness.

609
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,821
Seeing him yesterday,
I realized the world is fair.

610
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:06,158
Who knew that big shot would be
so unathletic and yet so competitive?

611
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,160
He was about to lose it.

612
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,912
Wasn't that so hilarious?

613
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,916
I don't get why that's so funny.

614
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,253
It's cute. He's human after all.

615
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,297
At first, I thought he was so cold.

616
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:21,215
He even lectured me about boundaries.

617
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:24,510
But once I crossed his boundaries,
he didn't push me away.

618
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,847
He even let us drag him
to the park yesterday.

619
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,057
He's so unpredictable, isn't he?

620
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:34,395
What?

621
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:36,897
What is it?

622
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:41,485
Ever heard of "mention syndrome"?

623
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:44,530
-Like premenstrual syndrome?
-No, you fool.

624
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:49,035
-When you catch feelings for someone,
-Jeez.

625
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:52,288
you can't help mentioning that person
over and over.

626
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:54,749
That's what you're doing with Mr. Choi.

627
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:55,791
Me?

628
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,835
Don't be ridiculous. That's not true.

629
00:38:57,918 --> 00:39:00,755
Do you know how many times
you've mentioned him today alone?

630
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,757
At least 20 times.

631
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:08,179
That's because he got hurt
while he was with us, so I'm worried.

632
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:11,640
Also, he's the person
I'm the most grateful to right now.

633
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:13,642
We've been building trust and loyalty too.

634
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:16,979
That's all?

635
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,106
Are you sure?

636
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,442
Hey, are you sure?

637
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,818
Of course, that's all.

638
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,363
You're sick.
You find romance in every relationship.

639
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,864
Not everyone's like you.

640
00:39:26,947 --> 00:39:27,823
Seriously.

641
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,785
-Welcome.
-Welcome.

642
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,121
I'm not here as a customer.

643
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,956
May I speak to the owner, please?

644
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,709
That would be me. What's the matter?

645
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,627
I see.

646
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,254
I'm from Ganghyeon Police Station.

647
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:46,342
-Okay.
-You reported a metal ball attack

648
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,261
to the local precinct
a few months ago, correct?

649
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:52,556
I'd like to ask you what exactly happened.

650
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:54,975
Well…

651
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,277
-Hello, Detective Song.
-Where are you?

652
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,530
I'm at the store
where the metal ball attack was reported.

653
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:11,367
Like I said,
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.

654
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,120
There has been a series
of metal ball attacks.

655
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,622
How can you call this a harmless prank?

656
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,166
Be quiet and get back here right now.

657
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,211
-Why?
-The captain is flipping his lid.

658
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:24,547
Can't you make up an excuse?

659
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,881
Fine, I'll be right there.

660
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,308
Hello, Ms. Jang.

661
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,519
It's been a while.

662
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,021
I was wondering
if you'd forgotten about my store.

663
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,482
Ms. Nam.

664
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,192
Yes?

665
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:46,402
Don't you dare.

666
00:40:47,153 --> 00:40:48,571
Or I won't see you again.

667
00:40:52,366 --> 00:40:54,034
Congratulations to Hae-e.

668
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,247
What dishes do you have today?

669
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,249
Come on in and take a look.

670
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:01,709
Please.

671
00:41:05,337 --> 00:41:08,132
What on earth have you been up to?

672
00:41:09,133 --> 00:41:11,844
Why are you digging into a closed case?

673
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,054
-The thing is--
-Do you think I'm a joke?

674
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,433
You look down on me
because I haven't been promoted in years.

675
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:20,269
-Is that why you never listen to me?
-But sir, this case--

676
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:23,105
Come on. Be quiet, you brat.

677
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,441
How dare you talk back to the captain?

678
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:28,527
I'm sorry, sir.

679
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,613
I'll talk some sense into him.

680
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,115
He's just overzealous.

681
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:34,617
Go.

682
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,995
How can he do this to me?

683
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,581
I'm just trying to do my job.

684
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,125
Didn't you see it yourself?
It's definitely suspicious.

685
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:44,793
And you're telling me to bury it?

686
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:46,337
Seriously? At this stage?

687
00:41:48,464 --> 00:41:50,799
-I'm not telling you to bury it.
-What?

688
00:41:52,218 --> 00:41:54,637
Just be more discreet. Keep it quiet.

689
00:41:55,262 --> 00:41:57,640
-Be tactful.
-Detective Song.

690
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:01,227
Dig around for any leads
on the metal ball shooter.

691
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,271
Make sure word doesn't get out.

692
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:06,982
I had no idea you were….

693
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:10,152
Why didn't you say so?

694
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,154
Wait for me, Detective Song.

695
00:42:12,238 --> 00:42:13,280
What about dinner?

696
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,241
Deopbap, you punk.

697
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:22,957
Hey, Hae-e.

698
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,751
Hold on to that for me.

699
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:27,711
Why are you giving this to me?

700
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:30,548
The game starts right away,
and I'll need that afterward.

701
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,758
Gosh.

702
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,011
-Is this washed?
-Let's go.

703
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,054
Thank you.

704
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,308
Let's go.

705
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,226
Hey.

706
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:44,770
You could've just put it on the stands.

707
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,771
Yes.

708
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,481
I could have.

709
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:50,651
What's with you?

710
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,074
Jeez, he's getting on my nerves.

711
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:03,539
Hey, PE starts soon. Aren't you coming?

712
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,544
Hey, it's PE. Can't you hear me?

713
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:10,671
Be quiet and get out of here.

714
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:12,339
Leave me alone!

715
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:14,508
Gosh.

716
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:19,847
-Go for it!
-Here we go!

717
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,890
-You got this!
-Let's go!

718
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,726
-You can do this!
-You can win!

719
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:26,270
-Let's do this!
-You got this!

720
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,529
-Seo Geon-hu!
-Seo Geon-hu!

721
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,583
What's gotten into Sun-jae?

722
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:50,127
He usually slacks off in PE
so he can focus in class.

723
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,842
-Nice!
-Nice!

724
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,594
-Let's go.
-Great job!

725
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,804
It's okay, Geon-hu. You got this!

726
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:03,515
You can do it!

727
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:12,983
-Seo Geon-hu!
-Seo Geon-hu!

728
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,486
-Seo Geon-hu!
-Seo Geon-hu!

729
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,118
Hey!

730
00:44:24,203 --> 00:44:25,120
Come here.

731
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,831
-You pushed me.
-Hey, stop it.

732
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:29,625
-Didn't you?
-Don't.

733
00:44:29,708 --> 00:44:32,628
-You pushed me.
-Calm down, guys.

734
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,130
-What's with Sun-jae? Sun-jae!
-He pushed me.

735
00:44:35,214 --> 00:44:36,590
-Stop it.
-Hold on.

736
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,550
Just go study.

737
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,539
What's happening?

738
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,964
Mom, something's wrong with me.

739
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,341
The letters are popping out of the book!

740
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:21,468
I must be going crazy!

741
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:25,222
What are you talking about?
The letters are popping out of the book?

742
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:27,891
They're popping out right before my eyes!

743
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,894
Calm down, Su-a.

744
00:45:30,978 --> 00:45:33,313
Pull yourself together and listen to me.

745
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:36,733
Do you want to try taking a deep breath?

746
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:37,693
Slowly.

747
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,405
Slowly.

748
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:44,032
There you go. Good girl.

749
00:45:44,992 --> 00:45:47,244
You need to calm down, Su-a.

750
00:45:48,412 --> 00:45:50,914
Try solving the question again, okay?

751
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:53,333
Let me know if it happens again--

752
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,131
Okay, bye.

753
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:08,474
-I was so surprised.
-What?

754
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,809
The side dish shop's daughter
came out on top.

755
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,145
Has she always been that good?

756
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,482
She used to barely make the top 20.

757
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:17,858
I wonder what happened.

758
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,654
I thought one of the All Care kids
would come out on top.

759
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:24,031
I know.

760
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:28,869
All the stolen class materials
must have helped.

761
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:32,539
What are you talking about?
Stolen class materials?

762
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,082
The thing is,

763
00:46:34,166 --> 00:46:37,753
Sun-jae leaked All Care materials
to Hae-e.

764
00:46:38,837 --> 00:46:40,297
Can you believe that?

765
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:43,175
He would've continued
if Su-a hadn't caught him.

766
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,637
Are you saying she came out on top
in the September mock

767
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,805
just because of some class materials?

768
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:52,684
That might work for school exams.

769
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:55,687
But it's extremely difficult
to improve mock exam scores.

770
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:59,608
Could she have found an expensive tutor?

771
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,778
No way. Her mom can't afford it.

772
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:04,154
You never know.

773
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:06,532
I heard her dad runs a business
in the Philippines.

774
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,242
Maybe he sends them loads of money.

775
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:29,096
I'm sorry.

776
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:32,891
I can't believe you're sitting with me
because I've been such a fan.

777
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,601
That's why I keep glancing at you.

778
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:38,438
You can look all you want. I don't mind.

779
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,235
You're more aloof than I expected.

780
00:47:43,318 --> 00:47:47,906
In the videos, you seem energetic,
humorous, and friendly.

781
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,034
But you come across as
a bit cold in real life.

782
00:47:51,618 --> 00:47:54,079
I put on a mask during class, so to speak.

783
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:58,500
Some might call it fake or two-faced,
which I can't deny.

784
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,837
But I do that to make sure
the kids pay attention.

785
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:04,256
I see.

786
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,468
Come to think of it,
I put on a mask when I work too.

787
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,472
Perhaps everyone
in today's society does that

788
00:48:12,556 --> 00:48:13,849
in one way or another.

789
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:31,575
Is it dry?

790
00:48:32,367 --> 00:48:35,078
Too bad you have class later
and can't have any wine.

791
00:48:36,246 --> 00:48:37,372
Do you like wine?

792
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:38,957
I sometimes drink it.

793
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,712
I think you're incredible.

794
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:44,880
You're so good at math.

795
00:48:44,963 --> 00:48:46,757
I can play the piano,

796
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,467
but I'm terrible with numbers.

797
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:52,346
I sometimes even forget
my own phone number or birthday.

798
00:48:57,768 --> 00:48:58,894
Too honest, right?

799
00:49:00,103 --> 00:49:01,938
I didn't have to tell you that.

800
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:04,066
I suck at playing the piano.

801
00:49:04,149 --> 00:49:07,027
I can't even play Chopsticks
or Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star.

802
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:08,362
Oh, my. Really?

803
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:09,446
Yes.

804
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,080
What a shame.

805
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:20,832
We only got to spend
an hour together on our first date.

806
00:49:21,958 --> 00:49:23,126
Then let's meet again.

807
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:26,546
If you don't mind meeting at night,
let's go for some wine.

808
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,007
Sounds good. I'm a night owl anyway.

809
00:49:30,509 --> 00:49:32,844
Yes, this is going well.

810
00:49:32,928 --> 00:49:35,180
She's not only pretty but also kind.

811
00:49:35,263 --> 00:49:38,100
I knew I'd find
other women attractive too.

812
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:40,394
It was all just a misunderstanding.

813
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:42,437
I'm perfectly normal.

814
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:46,108
What's the integral value then?
According to the formula…

815
00:49:47,109 --> 00:49:50,987
the correct answer is 16 over 3.

816
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:53,281
These questions can be solved
a lot more easily

817
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,159
if you use graphs
in addition to the formulas.

818
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:57,661
-Okay?
-Got it.

819
00:49:57,744 --> 00:49:59,663
Try solving the questions on the next page

820
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:01,331
-and mark the ones you find difficult.
-Okay.

821
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,624
That's all for today.

822
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:05,001
-Thank you.
-You did well.

823
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:09,047
Okay.

824
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:11,007
Don't let your guard down.

825
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,719
Keep your guard up.

826
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,808
-Thank you, Chi-yeol.
-Sure.

827
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,352
Thanks, Jae-woo.

828
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,604
Where's your sister, by the way?

829
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,485
You're already done?

830
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,446
You finished early today.

831
00:50:33,655 --> 00:50:34,948
Give me just a second.

832
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,291
It's almost done.

833
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:50,422
Mr. Choi…

834
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,507
Mr. Choi! Take your dinner!

835
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:54,301
Mr. Choi! Take this!

836
00:50:54,384 --> 00:50:55,427
What's the hurry?

837
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,554
Hold on.

838
00:50:57,637 --> 00:50:59,723
Take your dinner.

839
00:51:01,808 --> 00:51:02,642
Okay, I will.

840
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:04,561
Gosh.

841
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:09,357
You're acting strange today.

842
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,527
Is your wrist still hurting?

843
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:15,655
I'm fine. Don't worry about it.

844
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:18,992
How can I not? You got hurt because of me.

845
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,204
This is why you should work out regularly.

846
00:51:25,123 --> 00:51:27,501
Do you have time
after Hae-e's class tomorrow?

847
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:31,296
Why do you ask?

848
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:34,508
There's this doctor I've been going to
since my handball days.

849
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:36,301
His acupuncture works wonders.

850
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,094
It relieves pain right away--

851
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:40,222
No, thanks.
I don't believe in alternative medicine.

852
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:44,267
I don't know what
"alternative medicine" is.

853
00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:47,521
But you can believe me. My body is proof.

854
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:52,192
-Goodness.
-If I ask, he'll even see you at night.

855
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,402
It's not that far either.
It's in Sangdo-dong.

856
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:55,946
Let me take you there tomorrow.

857
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:01,827
-We'd go together?
-Of course.

858
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:04,412
You're busy during the day, right?

859
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,957
I'll go with you.
I haven't seen the doctor in forever.

860
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,124
I see.

861
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,628
I'll take that as a yes
and make an appointment.

862
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,546
Okay?

863
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:14,297
Get home safe.

864
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:27,644
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

865
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,604
I mean…

866
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:31,940
it's not a date or anything.

867
00:52:33,525 --> 00:52:35,193
And my wrist does hurt.

868
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,739
Teachers need to take
good care of their wrists.

869
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:42,826
Okay.

870
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:45,036
I made the right decision.

871
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:47,831
I have no ulterior motives.

872
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:49,791
None whatsoever.

873
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,717
Gosh.

874
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,177
I shaved too close.

875
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:04,472
I don't look as masculine.

876
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:07,976
No.

877
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,270
It's nice to look neat.

878
00:53:11,771 --> 00:53:12,814
Neat is good.

879
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:17,903
I haven't bought any clothes lately.

880
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,322
I have nothing to wear.

881
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,454
What's the point of buying
designer clothes?

882
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:31,124
They're useless
when they're out of fashion.

883
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,797
What am I doing?

884
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,717
Why am I dressing up to see a doctor?

885
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,553
I must be crazy.

886
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,015
Should I wear jeans?

887
00:53:48,433 --> 00:53:49,559
Jeans should work.

888
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:54,731
I'll put a list of expected questions
for the talk show on your desk.

889
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:58,068
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

890
00:53:58,151 --> 00:53:59,819
Gosh, what's with your outfit today?

891
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,947
-Are those your pajamas?
-What's with the fit?

892
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,287
Does my outfit look that bad?

893
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,457
No, it's casual.

894
00:54:13,041 --> 00:54:15,043
-"Casual"?
-Yes, I mean…

895
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,253
It looks natural.

896
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,007
"Casual and natural"?

897
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:25,095
To be honest, it looks weird.

898
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,096
What happened?

899
00:54:26,179 --> 00:54:27,764
Cripes.

900
00:54:29,474 --> 00:54:30,725
I just sounded like her.

901
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:33,687
I've gone insane. Cripes.

902
00:54:57,335 --> 00:54:59,337
Hello, Director. How have you been?

903
00:55:01,256 --> 00:55:03,049
No, I haven't gotten off work yet.

904
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,342
I'm still at the office.

905
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,721
Right now?

906
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:10,473
I see.

907
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,434
You're nearby?

908
00:55:19,482 --> 00:55:21,109
This wasn't easy,

909
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:23,528
but I know
what a competent lawyer you are.

910
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,532
So I worked up the courage
and risked humiliation

911
00:55:27,615 --> 00:55:29,117
to ask you to see me.

912
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,452
The lengths parents will go to.

913
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:35,498
So there's currently
a police investigation going on?

914
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,918
Yes. The parents filed charges.

915
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:42,380
Good grief.
That brat will be the death of me.

916
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:44,632
A group assault on a kid

917
00:55:44,716 --> 00:55:46,968
when his mom is
the education director of Woorim High?

918
00:55:47,594 --> 00:55:50,847
But it's not like I can
follow my kid around 24 hours a day.

919
00:55:51,973 --> 00:55:53,558
God knows what he's been up to.

920
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:57,854
Kids can hide anything
from their parents if they want to.

921
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,023
You came to the right person.

922
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:04,110
First, I'll find out how far
the investigation has progressed.

923
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,412
Mr. Choi!

924
00:56:15,163 --> 00:56:15,997
Mr. Choi!

925
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,501
-Yes?
-You forgot this.

926
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,419
Tutoring materials for Nam Hae-e.

927
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:23,546
I included Woorim High's
past exams for the 11th grade.

928
00:56:23,630 --> 00:56:25,340
It slipped my mind. I was in a hurry.

929
00:56:25,423 --> 00:56:27,300
Are you stopping by somewhere on the way?

930
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,384
Maybe.

931
00:56:28,968 --> 00:56:29,803
I'm off. Thanks.

932
00:56:29,886 --> 00:56:31,429
-Drive safely.
-Okay.

933
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,519
Tutoring materials?

934
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,147
Choi Chi-yeol is tutoring someone?

935
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,442
The name is Nam Hae-e.

936
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:45,902
Nam Hae-e.

937
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,821
Probably goes to Woorim High.

938
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:49,280
Find out everything you can.

939
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,783
From latest grades to recent activities.

940
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,661
Keep me updated. Thanks.

941
00:56:56,996 --> 00:56:58,581
Choi Chi-yeol,

942
00:56:58,665 --> 00:57:00,208
I've got you now.

943
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:47,714
-Hello, Mr. Choi.
-Hello.

944
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,591
-Come on in.
-Hi.

945
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,969
Well…

946
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,307
I'm 12 minutes and 45 seconds late.
My meeting ran late.

947
00:57:58,683 --> 00:58:00,185
Hi, Chi-yeol…

948
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,186
I smell cologne.

949
00:58:02,395 --> 00:58:03,771
A lot of it.

950
00:58:09,736 --> 00:58:12,197
-Hae-e, let's get started.
-Okay.

951
00:58:15,241 --> 00:58:16,659
What is it?

952
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:21,498
You're going to Dr. Namgoong
with Mr. Choi later, right?

953
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:22,582
Yes. What about it?

954
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,419
Shouldn't you change?

955
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:28,796
You look a bit scruffy.
Put on some makeup too.

956
00:58:29,714 --> 00:58:31,841
You haven't seen him in a while.

957
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,051
Where are your manners?

958
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,263
Should I?

959
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,227
Do I look scruffy?

960
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,186
Yes, very.

961
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:45,980
I think I look fine.

962
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:55,258
God knows what he's been up to.

963
00:59:56,009 --> 00:59:58,970
Kids can hide anything
from their parents if they want to.

964
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:34,339
There has been a series
of metal ball attacks.

965
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,633
How can you call this a harmless prank?

966
01:00:52,148 --> 01:00:53,316
What is this?

967
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:55,068
Tell me.

968
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,612
What have you been up to?

969
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,282
What are you doing
sneaking out every night?

970
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:03,868
What's with this metal ball?

971
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,704
Explain.

972
01:01:06,788 --> 01:01:09,332
Have you been causing trouble?

973
01:01:09,415 --> 01:01:11,501
Hui-jae.

974
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:13,628
Hui-jae, tell me.

975
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:54,919
You're done?

976
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:57,046
Let's hurry. The doctor is waiting for us.

977
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:01,050
No.

978
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,262
I mean, sure.

979
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,347
Let's go.

980
01:02:06,931 --> 01:02:08,307
-What?
-What? I mean…

981
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:12,019
Let's go. Let's hurry.

982
01:02:13,938 --> 01:02:16,315
If you need a snack,
there are plums in the fridge.

983
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,234
-They're washed.
-Okay.

984
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:19,277
Mom,

985
01:02:19,986 --> 01:02:21,070
no need to hurry back.

986
01:02:21,154 --> 01:02:21,988
Take your time.

987
01:02:22,572 --> 01:02:25,450
Can I tag along, Haeng-seon?
I want to ride in Chi-yeol's--

988
01:02:25,533 --> 01:02:27,368
-Go on. Mr. Choi's waiting.
-Okay.

989
01:02:27,452 --> 01:02:28,494
See you.

990
01:02:34,167 --> 01:02:35,293
Why would you tag along?

991
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,088
Jeez.

992
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,716
GYESEONG EASTERN MEDICINE CLINIC

993
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:45,178
This doesn't seem like just a sprain.

994
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:47,972
You must use your wrist a lot.

995
01:02:48,055 --> 01:02:49,307
DR. NAMGOONG CHAN

996
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:52,769
When the wrist comes under pressure
for an extended period of time,

997
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,229
the ligaments get thicker,

998
01:02:55,313 --> 01:02:58,941
putting pressure on the median nerve
and causing pain.

999
01:02:59,525 --> 01:03:03,738
It's called carpal tunnel syndrome.

1000
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:06,032
What do you do for a living?

1001
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:07,909
I teach students.

1002
01:03:07,992 --> 01:03:10,495
I see. So you're a teacher.

1003
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,206
I teach at a private academy,
not at a school.

1004
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,541
He's not just any teacher though.

1005
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:16,667
He's a star teacher.

1006
01:03:16,751 --> 01:03:19,253
He makes tons of money
and is super popular.

1007
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,922
Charge him a lot.

1008
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:22,048
Is that right?

1009
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:24,884
Then I should rip him off big time.

1010
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:34,101
I don't know how much money you make,

1011
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,145
but your body is a piece of junk.

1012
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:37,563
It's a total mess.

1013
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,274
Did you just call my body
"a piece of junk"?

1014
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,319
Your pulse is extremely weak and faint.

1015
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:46,447
You're frail, to begin with,

1016
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:48,991
and you're overworked and under stress.

1017
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,619
You've been neglecting your body.

1018
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:55,957
You must have trouble sleeping too.

1019
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,208
Do you have insomnia?

1020
01:03:58,584 --> 01:04:00,044
How did you know?

1021
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,880
What do you think?
I'm not a psychic or anything.

1022
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:04,632
I can tell by your pulse.

1023
01:04:05,216 --> 01:04:08,135
You'll need some acupuncture
and moxibustion.

1024
01:04:09,095 --> 01:04:12,557
One session won't do.
Come by whenever you have time.

1025
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,560
But I'm quite busy, sir.

1026
01:04:15,643 --> 01:04:17,645
Suit yourself if you want to die.

1027
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:22,942
At this rate, you'll end up
on the doorstep of hell, young man.

1028
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,487
-Lie down now.
-Pardon?

1029
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,406
You don't want your wrist fixed?

1030
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:30,116
You can't receive acupuncture on a chair.

1031
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,039
All right. I'm going to insert needles

1032
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:40,334
into your neck, head, hands, wrists,

1033
01:04:40,418 --> 01:04:43,546
belly, ankles, and feet.

1034
01:04:43,629 --> 01:04:45,172
My head too?

1035
01:04:45,256 --> 01:04:47,508
Now, relax.

1036
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:48,759
Hold on.

1037
01:04:48,843 --> 01:04:51,304
Why insert needles into my head
when it's my wrist that hurts?

1038
01:04:51,387 --> 01:04:53,222
You said you have insomnia.

1039
01:04:53,306 --> 01:04:55,516
If you're nervous, I can hold your hand.

1040
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,768
Forget it. Don't be ridiculous.

1041
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:01,772
Don't be a crybaby.
It'll be over before you know it.

1042
01:05:01,856 --> 01:05:04,358
-Hold on.
-Here we go.

1043
01:05:05,151 --> 01:05:07,028
Wait.

1044
01:05:13,326 --> 01:05:14,368
So?

1045
01:05:15,077 --> 01:05:16,829
How's your wrist? Feeling any better?

1046
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,915
His acupuncture takes effect right away.

1047
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,083
Yes, I think I feel better.

1048
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:23,961
He can be a bit brusque,
but he's a good man.

1049
01:05:24,045 --> 01:05:25,630
He has excellent skills too.

1050
01:05:25,713 --> 01:05:28,090
Go see him from time to time.

1051
01:05:28,174 --> 01:05:29,342
Did you hear?

1052
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,260
You'll end up on the doorstep of hell.

1053
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:32,887
The doorstep of hell, my foot.

1054
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:34,931
I don't believe in an afterlife.

1055
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:38,100
Is there anything you believe in?

1056
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,226
Right.

1057
01:05:40,394 --> 01:05:41,687
How old are you?

1058
01:05:42,855 --> 01:05:43,773
Well…

1059
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:45,608
why do you ask?

1060
01:05:45,691 --> 01:05:46,901
I'm old enough.

1061
01:05:47,568 --> 01:05:50,780
It seems like
you're younger than I thought.

1062
01:05:50,863 --> 01:05:52,865
-Never mind.
-What?

1063
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:55,826
Is this about what happened back there?

1064
01:05:55,910 --> 01:05:57,620
It wasn't because I was scared.

1065
01:05:57,703 --> 01:06:00,164
I'm sensitive to sharp objects
like needles, so--

1066
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,332
I didn't say anything.

1067
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:04,251
Let's get something to eat.
I didn't pack you any dinner.

1068
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,294
It's on me.

1069
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:08,422
That's not what's important.
You seem to have gotten the wrong idea.

1070
01:06:08,506 --> 01:06:09,840
How about chueotang?

1071
01:06:09,924 --> 01:06:13,678
A lady I know runs a restaurant near here,
and it's open around the clock.

1072
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,596
I'd love to see her too.

1073
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:17,640
It's going to be so much fun.

1074
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:19,350
Listen, Ms. Nam Haeng-seon.

1075
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:23,604
You remembered my name.

1076
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:25,815
Correctly.

1077
01:06:27,108 --> 01:06:28,150
Yes!

1078
01:06:49,296 --> 01:06:50,965
I'm not scared of anything.

1079
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:54,427
I mean it.

1080
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:55,886
You never let anything go.

1081
01:06:56,721 --> 01:06:59,390
Go straight for just a bit more.
We're almost there.

1082
01:07:02,059 --> 01:07:04,103
Is the restaurant in this neighborhood?

1083
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,521
You've been here?

1084
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,232
Kind of.

1085
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:12,570
Actually, my mom used to run it.

1086
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:15,906
When she passed away,
a friend of hers took over.

1087
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:18,701
This takes me back.

1088
01:07:20,202 --> 01:07:24,331
Keep going straight
and make a right after the intersection.

1089
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:40,890
SU-JA'S CHUEOTANG

1090
01:07:40,973 --> 01:07:43,476
This is it?

1091
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:44,727
Yes.

1092
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:48,314
It's old and a bit run-down,
but the best places always are.

1093
01:07:48,397 --> 01:07:50,107
People line up to have lunch here.

1094
01:07:50,691 --> 01:07:53,069
My mom had many regulars too.

1095
01:07:53,152 --> 01:07:54,445
She was foul-mouthed,

1096
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,697
but she was a great cook
and had a big heart.

1097
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:07,708
Cripes. I never asked for one.

1098
01:08:07,792 --> 01:08:10,920
You need to fill your stomach
if you want to stay strong.

1099
01:08:11,003 --> 01:08:12,379
Hurry up.

1100
01:08:12,463 --> 01:08:14,590
Isn't it nice to drink some coffee?

1101
01:08:14,673 --> 01:08:17,551
You need to fill your stomach
if you want to stay strong.

1102
01:08:17,635 --> 01:08:19,929
Cripes, don't make me repeat myself.

1103
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:21,472
Cripes, what do you take me for?

1104
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:34,276
SEON'S CAFETERIA

1105
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,319
Thank you.

1106
01:08:35,402 --> 01:08:37,321
-Bye. Come again.
-Okay.

1107
01:08:37,404 --> 01:08:38,781
-Hello.
-Welcome.

1108
01:08:41,534 --> 01:08:43,285
My goodness. Look at you.

1109
01:08:43,369 --> 01:08:44,411
Come on in.

1110
01:08:44,912 --> 01:08:47,748
If you don't hurry,
there will be no food left for you.

1111
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:21,782
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1112
01:09:21,866 --> 01:09:23,951
There are memories
that get you back on your feet.

1113
01:09:24,034 --> 01:09:25,828
That's what her cafeteria is to me.

1114
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:27,163
That's why I was drawn to her.

1115
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,123
Reduced by half?

1116
01:09:29,206 --> 01:09:30,833
The rent has been reduced by half.

1117
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:32,418
Isn't that strange?
They just bought the building.

1118
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:34,128
-Should we hold a party?
-What?

1119
01:09:34,211 --> 01:09:37,631
He was looking at you, Hae-e, and Jae-woo
with so much warmth and affection.

1120
01:09:37,715 --> 01:09:39,341
Confess to him that you're single.

1121
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:41,677
What are you up to, Hui-jae?

1122
01:09:42,887 --> 01:09:45,181
Mr. Choi's seeing someone?

1123
01:09:45,806 --> 01:09:48,225
A beautiful pianist from a wealthy family?

1124
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:58,777
