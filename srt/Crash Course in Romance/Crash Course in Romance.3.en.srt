00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,358
Jae-woo! Get down!

3
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:25,710
What was that?

4
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:40,725
NUMBER OF OUTCOMES
WHERE DISLIKE BECOMES LIKE

5
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:42,685
EPISODE 3

6
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,604
It was pretty much attempted murder.

7
00:01:44,687 --> 00:01:47,315
Imagine if it hit someone.
It could've been terrible.

8
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:50,193
This is a serious matter.

9
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,611
Whoever that psycho is,

10
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,114
you never know when
they'll get up to something worse.

11
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,783
As the bodyguards of society,
you need to catch them--

12
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:57,700
It's "Guardians."

13
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,077
"Guardians of society."

14
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,246
Same difference. Anyway.

15
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:05,458
So you two are
just shop owner and customer?

16
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:06,960
Yes, basically.

17
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:08,503
Well,

18
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,755
there's a bit more to it.

19
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:11,881
To be precise,

20
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:14,008
we're also offender and victim.

21
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,137
That young man over there
stole my brother's phone and ran off--

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,806
"Young man"? And I didn't steal it, lady.

23
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,307
Who are you calling "lady"?

24
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:22,642
Are you kidding me, mister?

25
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,312
Officer, there was just
a little misunderstanding.

26
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:28,148
I even offered to compensate her,

27
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,607
but she turned it down.

28
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,276
That phone was a much newer model.

29
00:02:31,359 --> 00:02:32,360
There you go again.

30
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:35,405
If you've done something wrong,
make a sincere apology first.

31
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,241
Did you think I'd be grateful
if you threw a new phone at me?

32
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:41,119
-What do you take me for?
-Fine, here's my sincere apology.

33
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:42,912
I'm sorry. Please forgive me. Happy?

34
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:44,998
See? You're trying to taunt me.

35
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:47,000
This man has a knack for annoying people.

36
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:49,043
I'll take that as a compliment.

37
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,253
Enough.

38
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:52,338
You can talk it out outside later.

39
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:55,133
Do you have any idea
who might've done this?

40
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:57,802
Anyone upset with you
or holding a grudge against you?

41
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,262
No.

42
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,682
I've been running my shop
for four years now.

43
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:04,058
My top priority

44
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,769
has been staying on good terms
with my customers.

45
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:11,065
I'm not so sure after watching
you two quarrel the entire time.

46
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:14,861
Officer.

47
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,947
May I have a word with you for a second?

48
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,699
Just a second, please.

49
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,870
Not in there.

50
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:25,830
I can't?

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,166
Not there either.

52
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:29,334
-No?
-No.

53
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,836
Then let's just talk over here.

54
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,965
I…

55
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:38,635
could've been the target.

56
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,762
Sorry?

57
00:03:41,721 --> 00:03:42,931
What do you mean?

58
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,688
That's right, it's me.

59
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:53,942
Who…

60
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,488
Well, how should I put this?

61
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,366
I happen to be a celebrity

62
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:04,327
who has a lot of rivals.

63
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,122
People secretly take photos of me
on the street

64
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,250
and post them on social media.

65
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,920
Then they argue and debate
over what I did and didn't do.

66
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:15,004
One time…

67
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:16,965
I yawned like this.

68
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:21,302
Someone posted a close-up of it online
and claimed that I had drooled,

69
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,720
which I hadn't.

70
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,723
I had just drunk coffee.
That's why it was wet around my mouth.

71
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,896
The price of fame, I guess.

72
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,150
There are pitfalls that come
with being well-known.

73
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:39,696
So who are you?

74
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:42,198
I guess no one you know
is studying for the CSAT?

75
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:49,914
I'm Choi Chi-yeol,

76
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:51,708
the star teacher.

77
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:52,834
Choi Chi what?

78
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:56,546
Mr. Choi!

79
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,340
-Mr. Choi.
-Mr. Ji.

80
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,553
It's okay.

81
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:05,763
It's all right.

82
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:08,099
Everything's okay now.

83
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,894
It's all right.

84
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,109
Goodness.

85
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,280
Are you okay, sir?

86
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,744
Try taking some deep breaths.

87
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,250
Can we get one of those calming drinks?

88
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:43,760
You've been getting food
from Nation's Best?

89
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,888
Why didn't you tell me?
I could've done it for you.

90
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:49,974
I was embarrassed to tell you

91
00:05:50,516 --> 00:05:52,477
because I told you not to go back there.

92
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,562
I also wanted to pick
the side dishes myself.

93
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:58,483
The person who shot that metal ball…

94
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,068
Could it be my stalker?

95
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,861
It's weird she suddenly disappeared.

96
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,113
Maybe Chiyeolsucks? Probably not.

97
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,656
Online haters are cowards.

98
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,076
All they do is bad-mouth people
behind their backs.

99
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,163
Or maybe it's Director Cha of Perfect M?

100
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,915
He's definitely the sneaky type.

101
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm not sure.

102
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:20,505
Rest up for now. You look pale.

103
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,382
I probably should.

104
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,344
I was terrified back there.

105
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,138
I was army crawling before I knew it.

106
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,348
That metal ball
shattered the window to pieces.

107
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:14,475
Considering the velocity and acceleration,

108
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:18,187
the shooter must have been
at least 10m away.

109
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:21,566
Considering the angle, it didn't seem
like it was shot from above.

110
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:26,362
If it was shot from a moving car,

111
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:31,033
its trajectory might have been caught
on the CCTV cameras in the neighborhood.

112
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:35,663
By analyzing the footage, I might be
able to pinpoint where it was shot from.

113
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,458
I'll have to go back there tomorrow.

114
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:47,633
Talk about a bolt out of the blue.

115
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,886
If I had known this would happen,

116
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,013
I wouldn't have
cleaned the windows last week.

117
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:53,764
What did the police say?

118
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:56,100
They said the investigation won't be easy.

119
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,394
There are no CCTV cameras around here.

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,396
Whatever.

121
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,690
Things shatter whenever
I'm around that tiger.

122
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,484
The phone, the window, and my money.

123
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,860
You mean Choi Chi-yeol?

124
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,448
What does he have to do with this?
I'm talking about the tiger.

125
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,783
Be quiet. I'm on edge today.

126
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,660
Got it.

127
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:16,621
But the bus stop ad--

128
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,997
I said, be quiet!

129
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,373
Go take a walk or something!

130
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,584
Have some waffles or whatever.
Leave me alone.

131
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,089
-But the tiger is Choi Chi-yeol.
-You little…

132
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:32,011
-We're finished, ma'am.
-Thank you.

133
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,847
How much is it? Do you take credit cards?

134
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:35,765
Of course.

135
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,310
That'll be 1,028,000 won,
including the installation.

136
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,811
You can just pay 1,020,000 won.

137
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,317
What? 1,020,000 won?

138
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:56,285
Pull yourself together, Ms. Nam.

139
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,871
You've been losing
so much money this month.

140
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,124
I'm really breaking the bank here.

141
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:07,380
I should've just swallowed my pride
and taken that phone yesterday.

142
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,339
Totally.

143
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,758
When you were lecturing him
about making an apology,

144
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,927
I did think you were being
a bit ridiculous.

145
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,097
Do you think he'll give it back?

146
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,431
Would you?

147
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,141
After you disregarded his kindness?

148
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,269
Kindness, my foot.
He was only making up for…

149
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:27,567
Whose side are you on?

150
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:29,402
You always side with men, don't you?

151
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,737
I can't deny that.

152
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,072
I love men.

153
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,117
Anyway, shouldn't you get going?

154
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,743
Go where? I need to make money.

155
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,662
To the academy. You have to book a seat.

156
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:41,706
You're right. It slipped my mind.

157
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,291
I'm off.

158
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,750
Please watch the shop.

159
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,752
Run, Haeng-seon!

160
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,837
Go!

161
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:52,383
Hey, why aren't there
many CCTV cameras around here?

162
00:09:53,467 --> 00:09:55,845
…was what I wanted to ask her.

163
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
But she's gone.

164
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:01,183
Which is totally fine.

165
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,145
She must be in a hurry.

166
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,785
Gosh, it's cold!

167
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:20,828
That little…

168
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:23,706
My bad.

169
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:17,968
There's Choi Chi-yeol!

170
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,096
-There he is!
-Mr. Choi!

171
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,180
Where?

172
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,058
I missed him again.

173
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:25,810
I'd love to see him in real life.

174
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:30,231
Yeong-ju, I'm off.

175
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:32,691
My bad.

176
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,126
Wow.

177
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:52,753
Just 30 people before me.

178
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,237
Let's focus on the condition
that the common difference is an integer.

179
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:23,409
"When a sequence satisfies the conditions
described below, find the 20th term."

180
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:27,079
"So a sub one and a sub two…"

181
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,707
1ST SEMESTER FINAL EXAM, DAY 4
LITERATURE, MATH

182
00:12:43,846 --> 00:12:46,599
Today's special plus one soup.
That'll be 14,500 won, please.

183
00:12:46,682 --> 00:12:48,017
Insert your card, please.

184
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,145
Just saying "please"
doesn't make you polite.

185
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:53,522
Who are you trying to be polite to?

186
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:54,940
To me?

187
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,984
Or to my card?

188
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:10,831
Have a nice day, please.

189
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,341
How was the exam?

190
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,551
It was mostly fine.

191
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:25,804
Except for English.
But I think I can still make Level 1.

192
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,432
That's great then.

193
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:30,684
You did well.

194
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,769
Great job.

195
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,021
You could use some rest.

196
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,190
Too bad you have to go
straight to the academy.

197
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,235
But what can you do?
Just hang in there a little longer.

198
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,947
Preparing for college admissions

199
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,199
is but one moment in your life,

200
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,825
but the results are permanent.

201
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,453
-You know that, right?
-I do.

202
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:53,123
By the way, the academy sucks these days.

203
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,542
Especially the math class.

204
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,751
Why?

205
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,086
Is the teaching not good?

206
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:58,295
That's not it.

207
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,214
It's just too easy for me.

208
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:02,007
It's such a waste of time.

209
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:03,842
You're right.

210
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,638
If a top student like you studies
with a bunch of ordinary kids,

211
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,848
it does tend to be a waste of time.

212
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:12,101
Speaking of which,

213
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,146
about the Med School All Care Program
that starts in the winter…

214
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,023
Should I ask them to move it up to summer?

215
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,984
Is that possible?

216
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,485
Of course.

217
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:22,570
I'm an influencer.

218
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,989
The academy director
will have to listen to me.

219
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:26,532
Don't you know that?

220
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,413
I've been quite enjoying
your posts on Skymom.net.

221
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,330
I'm glad.

222
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:38,002
I don't pursue personal interests
because it creates bad blood.

223
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,880
Instead, I stick to
sharing information based on facts.

224
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,299
Speaking of which,

225
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:45,259
I'd like to make a suggestion, Director.

226
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,677
I'm all ears.

227
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:49,638
It's about the All Care Program
that starts in December.

228
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,558
It's the flagship program
of The Pride, right?

229
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:56,937
A class of just seven students taught
by star teachers is extremely special.

230
00:14:57,021 --> 00:15:00,858
It's also the very reason why
I enrolled Su-a in this academy.

231
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:01,775
Absolutely.

232
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:04,695
You could call it the pride of The Pride.

233
00:15:04,778 --> 00:15:07,781
I pushed ahead with it
from the very beginning.

234
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:08,908
I know that.

235
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,159
It was all you.

236
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:13,746
But after giving it some thought,

237
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,582
I wondered, "Why wait until the winter?"

238
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,710
Many other academies
have similar programs now.

239
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:22,671
If you're to gain an edge,

240
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,592
why don't you start the program
this summer instead?

241
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:30,638
But you see,

242
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,725
things are not that simple.

243
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:38,479
Our teachers already have
their schedules set for the year.

244
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,314
If you make it happen,

245
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:43,025
I'll put in a good word with moms
for next season's courses

246
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,486
as well as your summer program.

247
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,197
You're still behind Perfect M

248
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,324
when it comes to
English and Language Arts.

249
00:15:50,824 --> 00:15:51,700
Aren't you?

250
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,370
Well…

251
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:58,248
I'll see what I can do.

252
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:01,835
This may look like
a complicated cubic function question,

253
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,337
but it's not hard to solve.

254
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,339
So how do we approach it?

255
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,094
I'm shook.

256
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:13,514
No one?

257
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,350
For real?

258
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:19,228
We…

259
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:21,772
need to pay attention to the boundary.

260
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,524
How?

261
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,275
Well…

262
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:28,696
We can use the fact that the number
of points of intersection changes

263
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,155
as the two functions intersect.

264
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,745
Bet.

265
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:42,835
That was spot-on.

266
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,379
The change in the number
of intersection points is key.

267
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,296
Let's see.

268
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,048
The cubic function, f(x) equals

269
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,218
x cubed minus x squared

270
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:54,013
plus bx, and the curve, y equals…

271
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:57,182
Once again, I crushed it in class.

272
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,976
-This way, sir.
-I know.

273
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,354
You're also crushing it on Studyhard.com.

274
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,397
Why?

275
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:06,859
You gave that girl
a high five during class.

276
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:07,860
"I'm jealous."

277
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:08,944
"Stay away from him."

278
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,320
"I'd never wash my hand."

279
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,573
"High five" is the top trending search.

280
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,701
Was it intentional?

281
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:17,661
Of course.

282
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:21,665
These incidents are effective
for encouraging class participation.

283
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:24,626
Plus, that girl did give a spot-on answer.

284
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:28,130
So you had everything planned out.

285
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,215
What about dinner?

286
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,216
Nation's Best again?

287
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,970
Sure. I'm stopping by on my way home.

288
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,890
The owner is a bit cold,
but I can stomach her food.

289
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,391
It's also fun to pick the side dishes.

290
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,102
They're closing soon.

291
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,604
Go home. I'm off.

292
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:44,772
Drive safe.

293
00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,026
This damn air pollution.

294
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,611
The windows are filthy.

295
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,071
What should I do about this?

296
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:53,906
Leave it.

297
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:55,699
They'll get dirty again in no time.

298
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,618
They cost an arm and a leg.

299
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,828
I'll treasure them for as long as I live.

300
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,062
Why?

301
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,650
Why did you have to show up
right at that moment?

302
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,823
Anyway, I'm sorry.
I should've been more careful.

303
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,908
Is that a sincere apology?

304
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:41,286
Yes, I sincerely apologize.

305
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,956
It was my fault this time. I'm sorry.

306
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,125
Take that off. I'll dry it.

307
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,209
Change into this.

308
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:50,963
By the way,
this is the most expensive garment I own.

309
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,883
It was purchased at Sinu Department Store
in Gangnam on April 27, 2020

310
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,303
by Haeng-seon as an early birthday gift
as she was feeling happy from drinking.

311
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,388
Jae-woo.

312
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:03,392
Given the situation,
he'll have to borrow it for a second.

313
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,979
No, thanks.
I don't wear strangers' clothes.

314
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:08,355
It won't take long.

315
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,233
You'll catch a cold
wearing wet clothes with the AC on.

316
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,860
Take it off. I'll look away.

317
00:19:12,943 --> 00:19:14,611
I'm fine. I'm going home.

318
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,155
Not so fast.

319
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:17,156
Give me ten minutes.

320
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,282
No, five minutes.

321
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,950
I'll dry your clothes.

322
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:21,702
You can change inside if you want.

323
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,245
Why insist? I said I'm fine.

324
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:24,246
-You'll catch a cold!
-I'm leaving--

325
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,539
Mr. Choi!

326
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,339
What is my teacher doing here?

327
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,175
Your teacher?

328
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,177
Who is?

329
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:43,974
This is Mr. Choi Chi-yeol.

330
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,312
The star math teacher from the academy.

331
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:44,660
For math,

332
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,703
Choi Chi-yeol.

333
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:50,749
Get out of here.

334
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,419
How in the world did the tiger
turn out to be Choi Chi-yeol?

335
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:55,545
That tiger…

336
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,924
After all I've done to him?

337
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,636
I'm baffled too.

338
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:05,430
The person you've been cursing out
for stealing the phone

339
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,682
turns out to be Mr. Choi?

340
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:08,558
Hae-e.

341
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,271
Is this really him?

342
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,274
He looked totally wimpy in real life.

343
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:18,485
But here, he exudes charisma
and an excellent sense of humor.

344
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:19,611
Hae-e.

345
00:21:20,988 --> 00:21:22,531
What's he like? Is he unforgiving?

346
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,533
Do you think he'll hold a grudge?

347
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:29,538
No. I doubt he will.

348
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,915
You never know.

349
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:34,835
I still can't believe
this cutie from the video

350
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:38,130
and the man who was just here
are the same person.

351
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:40,299
Maybe he's two-faced.

352
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,843
Or maybe he has an alter ego.

353
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:43,844
Hold on.

354
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,096
What about his membership card?

355
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:50,350
See?

356
00:21:50,934 --> 00:21:52,769
It says, "Ji Dong-hui,"
not "Choi Chi-yeol."

357
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,938
It's the manager's name.

358
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:56,773
The manager?

359
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,109
That fragile and pale one?

360
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:01,486
So it was his name.

361
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,779
I even like his name.

362
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,573
This is driving me crazy.

363
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:08,160
How did I not recognize him?
I pass by the academy every day.

364
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,955
I did think he looked familiar
from the beginning though.

365
00:22:12,914 --> 00:22:14,624
That's what I told you.

366
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,418
The tiger is Choi Chi-yeol.

367
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,128
When did you tell me that?

368
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:19,921
The day you had the windows replaced.

369
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,384
So that was what you meant?

370
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:26,928
Goodness.

371
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,597
Then you should've said so, punk.

372
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,766
-Stop it, Mom.
-Why didn't you? Let go of me.

373
00:22:30,849 --> 00:22:33,518
-You're going to hurt him.
-I said, let go!

374
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,896
-You little…
-Calm down.

375
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:10,764
How is this possible?

376
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:15,268
That shop owner turns out to be
the mom of one of my students?

377
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:18,605
She didn't look that old though.

378
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:22,901
This changes everything.

379
00:23:24,694 --> 00:23:27,781
I should've been more careful.
Why didn't it cross my mind?

380
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,079
I hope she doesn't write
on Skymom.net or anything.

381
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:36,873
"Choi Chi-yeol stole a phone."
"He's two-faced."

382
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,835
Hold on.

383
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:42,170
THE TRUE FACE OF CHOI CHI-YEOL

384
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,296
A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE

385
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,714
Gosh, that scared me.

386
00:23:49,803 --> 00:23:50,762
That's cute.

387
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,681
"Like."

388
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,188
Whatever. It wasn't intentional.

389
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,232
We both got the wrong idea, so we're even.

390
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,111
Still, we're not equal.

391
00:24:06,194 --> 00:24:07,821
He definitely has power over us.

392
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,157
We're not equals at all.

393
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,034
Give me my brother's phone, you thief.

394
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:20,876
Why?

395
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,253
Splashing water on him was too much.

396
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,922
What if he starts mistreating Hae-e?

397
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,176
Fine.

398
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,219
Since I'm the one that messed up,

399
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,054
I'm the one who should make up for it.

400
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:34,306
It's all on me now.

401
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,976
The owner of Nation's Best
is the mom of one of your students?

402
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,103
SKYMOM.NET

403
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,022
She looks young for her age.

404
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,024
I would've never guessed she was a parent.

405
00:24:44,107 --> 00:24:45,692
Me neither.

406
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,278
When that high-five girl
showed up and called her "Mom,"

407
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:50,113
I felt a shiver down my spine.

408
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:51,823
You mean Nam Hae-e.

409
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:54,367
She enrolled for the first time
in Season 2.

410
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,328
She's diligent.
She scores high on the tests too.

411
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,413
I know. She's a smart kid.

412
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,749
She doesn't take after her mom at all.

413
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,794
What are you doing?

414
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:06,963
I want to make sure

415
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:11,259
that woman isn't bad-mouthing me
on the internet.

416
00:25:12,302 --> 00:25:14,596
She doesn't seem like the type who would.

417
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:16,640
You think so? Are you sure?

418
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:17,599
Yes.

419
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,143
You want me to say that three times?

420
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,020
Yes, please.

421
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:24,564
She's not going to do that.

422
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:26,733
What?

423
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:28,652
It's Nation's Best.

424
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,487
What could it be?

425
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:31,947
Why is she calling me?

426
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:33,740
Just answer it.

427
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:40,288
Choi Chi-yeol speaking.

428
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,040
Hello, Mr. Choi.

429
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:44,251
It's me, the owner
of Nation's Best Banchan.

430
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,377
Hae-e's mom.

431
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,295
I know you're busy,

432
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,298
but I was wondering if you could stop by.

433
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,636
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

434
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:57,931
I have a bad feeling about this.

435
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:00,225
Maybe she's decided she can't let this go.

436
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:04,104
Maybe she thinks I'm still a phone thief
despite our misunderstanding.

437
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,730
What if she wants to sue me?

438
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,525
Or will she start a fistfight with me?

439
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,112
She used to be on the national team.
I might lose.

440
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:15,407
Then let's be cowards
and fight two-on-one.

441
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:18,535
Okay. Keep your word.

442
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,708
Hello, Mr. Choi.

443
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:26,209
Please come on in.

444
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,003
-Hello, Mr. Choi.
-Hello.

445
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,880
I'm sorry I asked you to come
when you're so busy.

446
00:26:30,964 --> 00:26:34,884
The thing is,
I prepared a little something for you.

447
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,136
What is it?

448
00:26:36,219 --> 00:26:37,429
Hello, sir.

449
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:41,182
This is gujeolpan.

450
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,727
Charcoal-grilled tteokgalbi,
kkochi, and mushroom jeon.

451
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,354
This is steamed squid.
Be sure to eat the guts too.

452
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,523
I used fresh squid, so don't worry.

453
00:26:48,606 --> 00:26:49,816
It'll make a perfect meal

454
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,569
or a great snack
to pair with wine after class.

455
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:54,404
I can't eat all this.

456
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,072
Why not?

457
00:26:56,156 --> 00:26:58,616
You teach all day long.
You should at least eat this much.

458
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,036
You're a bit too skinny.

459
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,288
He should put on some weight, right?

460
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,998
Well, I guess.

461
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:08,043
I've always been slim,

462
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,128
but that doesn't mean I'm weak.

463
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:11,087
Of course not.

464
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,922
You look great, actually.

465
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:15,342
You do look more fashionable
when you're slim.

466
00:27:22,098 --> 00:27:23,391
Anyway,

467
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,392
I appreciate it.

468
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,854
And I'm sorry for everything.

469
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:29,606
Don't be.

470
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,733
I'm the one who should apologize.
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,651
No, I'm sorry.

472
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,571
Please. I'm the one at fault here.

473
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:38,281
-No, you're not.
-I am.

474
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,159
-No.
-Why are you doing this, Mr. Choi?

475
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,203
-I'm sorry.
-No, Mr. Choi.

476
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:44,954
-Why…
-No.

477
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,999
Jae-woo,

478
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,377
the way your sister
changes her position so quickly

479
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,961
never ceases to amaze.

480
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,547
It was her forte as an athlete too.

481
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,551
But why is she suddenly being so nice?

482
00:28:00,136 --> 00:28:01,262
Jae-woo,

483
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:03,848
in the end,
humans are just like wild animals.

484
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,934
You know the law of the jungle, right?

485
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,685
Since Choi Chi-yeol has more power,

486
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:10,355
your powerless sister
is offering him food.

487
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,981
Like a tribute to a king.

488
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,777
But my sister isn't powerless.

489
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,988
All parents are powerless
when it comes to their children.

490
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:23,201
Her head almost touched the ground.

491
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,036
She's super flexible.

492
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,338
You worried for nothing.

493
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,507
She's really kind.

494
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,425
I know.

495
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:40,927
She's surprisingly forgiving.

496
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:43,638
No wonder she was on the national team.

497
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,765
But can I really accept this?

498
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,184
You know I never accept
any gifts from parents.

499
00:28:48,268 --> 00:28:49,144
That I do.

500
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,605
But when you tried to pay her,
she got furious.

501
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:53,982
Tell me about it!

502
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:54,899
That lady…

503
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:59,404
I mean, Ms. Nam is terrifying
when she's angry.

504
00:29:01,072 --> 00:29:02,490
Considering all of her efforts,

505
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,951
I think it's okay
to accept it just this once.

506
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,745
You can become her regular in return.

507
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:08,496
True.

508
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,622
You're right.

509
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:11,624
Become her regular. That's a good idea.

510
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:13,960
Want me to tell you
everything's okay three times?

511
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,253
Forget it.

512
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,546
I'll repay her kindness.

513
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:18,631
Send her a gift from the department store.

514
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,552
I guess I'll share this
with my assistants for dinner.

515
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,477
Hello, sir. Yes.

516
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,150
I see. I'll relay it to him.

517
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:38,526
Bye.

518
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:41,738
-Mr. Choi.
-What is it?

519
00:29:42,864 --> 00:29:44,449
-You can't eat with us.
-Why?

520
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,160
-Our director is buying you dinner.
-Why?

521
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,162
He has something important to discuss.

522
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:51,915
He scheduled it for today
since you have no classes.

523
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,082
Why…

524
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,504
I'm not going to eat anything there.

525
00:29:58,254 --> 00:29:59,380
So leave some for me.

526
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:07,096
Mr. Choi,
you haven't even touched your food.

527
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,557
This is the highest-quality Korean beef.
Eat up.

528
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,936
I have other plans. Please hurry up.

529
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:16,231
This is expensive.
We should finish all of it.

530
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,402
Well…

531
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:26,115
I gathered up all the star teachers
of our academy today

532
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,952
because I have a suggestion to make.

533
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:32,539
It's about the Med School
All Care Program.

534
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,999
Could we move it up to this summer?

535
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,167
-What?
-What?

536
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,253
I know this is sudden,

537
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,380
but there's been a request from parents.

538
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:43,883
As a matter of fact, I'd been debating
whether to move it up anyway.

539
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:44,926
Think about it.

540
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:48,304
All the other academies start their course
right before the senior year.

541
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,890
What's the point of doing it
at the same time as them?

542
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,058
We need an edge.

543
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:53,810
I think it'll be a bit difficult.

544
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,270
We have our year planned out.

545
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,604
We can make adjustments.

546
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,022
I can sort things out.

547
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,482
Still, this is so sudden.

548
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,400
Exactly.

549
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,694
I need to teach at the second branch too.

550
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,614
The All Care Program
only consists of seven students.

551
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:10,493
Picking out the members sooner than later
will be in our best interest.

552
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:16,624
If you don't want to, I won't force it.

553
00:31:18,668 --> 00:31:19,669
I'm in.

554
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:22,380
You're in?

555
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:24,424
You want to move it up?

556
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,093
The curriculum is all set anyway.

557
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,722
We might not have much time
to put together a level test,

558
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,931
but it's not impossible.

559
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,935
We could hold a parent information session
while the level test is being conducted

560
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,562
since we're short on time.

561
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:44,193
Mr. Choi, you really are
the true brains of our academy.

562
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:46,404
Great! Sounds like a plan.

563
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:48,781
I want new blackboards in return.

564
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,784
-What?
-For the classrooms.

565
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:53,286
I want enamel blackboards.

566
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:55,496
I have a model in mind.
I'll send you the link.

567
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,206
Right, the blackboards.

568
00:31:57,290 --> 00:32:00,668
I've been looking into it
since you mentioned it last time.

569
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:05,048
But they're almost double
the price of ordinary ones.

570
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,634
And the installation and whatnot…

571
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:09,510
-It's such a hassle.
-It is.

572
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,139
But so is changing our schedule
for this program

573
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,850
and putting together a level test.

574
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,769
Is anything in this world not a hassle?

575
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,355
I see your point.

576
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,941
Even if it's a hassle,
we need to get it done.

577
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,652
Let's get those enamel blackboards. Okay.

578
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,614
On that note, let's have one last drink.

579
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:35,703
You want to split the bill?

580
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,664
Let's go now.

581
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,003
Isn't that Choi Chi-yeol?

582
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,089
Chi-yeol.

583
00:32:50,093 --> 00:32:51,010
Hey.

584
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,595
It's been a while.

585
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:53,513
Gosh.

586
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,348
How long has it been?

587
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,142
I bet we're the only ones
who've seen you in the past decade.

588
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:01,312
Yeong-seok, I'm sorry
I couldn't attend your mother's funeral.

589
00:33:01,396 --> 00:33:03,147
My schedule was full during the break.

590
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:05,566
Don't worry about it.
I understand that you're busy.

591
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,527
Take a seat.

592
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:09,654
Drink with us. It's been so long.

593
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:14,617
I took out huge loans
to get that apartment, but I screwed up.

594
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:17,328
I think I bought it
at the top of the market.

595
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,414
But you're actually going to live there.

596
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,915
You're getting married soon.

597
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,625
It was partly an investment.

598
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:24,919
I proposed as soon as I bought it,

599
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,672
but now that the wedding is coming up,

600
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,007
I'm getting cold feet.

601
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,134
Sorry.

602
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,969
-Are we boring you?
-Not at all.

603
00:33:33,052 --> 00:33:35,388
Chi-yeol, are you getting married
anytime soon?

604
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:36,806
I'm too busy with work.

605
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,474
Why would he get married?

606
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:41,686
With all the money he's making,
he should just enjoy his single life.

607
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,603
Hey,

608
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,313
I saw this article the other day.

609
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:47,483
Do you really make
more than ten billion won a year?

610
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:49,277
Is that true?

611
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,154
No, I actually make a bit more.

612
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,948
-Jeez, that's incredible.
-You made it big, man.

613
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,743
Back when he used to be penniless,

614
00:33:56,826 --> 00:33:58,870
his shoulders looked a lot narrower.

615
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,122
But look at those killer shoulders now.

616
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:03,332
This is why you should succeed
no matter what.

617
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,250
Don't you agree?

618
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,668
He looks the same.

619
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:07,462
I heard you own multiple buildings.

620
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,089
Where do you live now?

621
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:12,967
I live near the academy. At the Emerald.

622
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:15,428
Don't tell me you live in the penthouse.

623
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:17,513
Stop prying.

624
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,140
Do you?

625
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,350
I do.

626
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,144
Can we come over?

627
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,312
If it's the penthouse,

628
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,814
it must be huge.

629
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,233
Right, let's hold
a class reunion there sometime.

630
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:31,194
If we can fix a date.

631
00:34:31,819 --> 00:34:33,571
Guys, I'm getting a call.

632
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,614
Excuse me.

633
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,531
Sure.

634
00:34:36,908 --> 00:34:39,118
Go ahead and eat without me.

635
00:34:39,202 --> 00:34:40,870
I ran into some friends.

636
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,664
What's with that reaction?

637
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,208
Can't I meet friends?

638
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,294
All right. Enjoy.

639
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:50,088
See you tomorrow.

640
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:58,012
I didn't expect Choi Chi-yeol
to really join us.

641
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:01,390
We flattered him a little,
and he started bragging.

642
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,267
Gosh, he's so annoying.

643
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:05,353
I've lost my appetite.

644
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,231
You guys encouraged him.

645
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:11,067
He used to be innocent and kind-hearted.

646
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,069
He's so full of himself now.

647
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,613
I wish he'd just pay and leave.

648
00:35:15,696 --> 00:35:16,906
He can't leave yet.

649
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,324
I want more beef.

650
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,369
This is a rare opportunity.

651
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,037
Order some more.

652
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,790
We should all get beef tartare bibimbap.

653
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:28,709
Jong-ryeol, stop drinking.
What's with you?

654
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:29,836
Is something wrong?

655
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,091
It's for the table over there.

656
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,676
Add a few more servings of beef.

657
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,718
Sure.

658
00:35:47,895 --> 00:35:50,773
Gatherings like that
are completely pointless.

659
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,359
You harm your health by drinking,

660
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,319
and you waste your time on chit-chat.

661
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,489
This is why I stay away
from class reunions.

662
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,161
This is awesome.

663
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,663
-Even better with Mr. Choi away.
-I know.

664
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,624
It'd feel uncomfortable to eat like this
if he were here.

665
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,168
He wouldn't let us drink either.

666
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,794
Today is an exception.

667
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:13,087
This is the only time.

668
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,755
-Fine.
-We get it.

669
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,674
Anyway, let's enjoy the time we have!

670
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,260
-Let's drink!
-Cheers!

671
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,853
-This is so good.
-It is.

672
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:30,855
-Try this.
-How do I eat this?

673
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,440
What a feast.

674
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:04,388
What's all this?
Are you sure this is for me?

675
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,182
Yes, it's for Nation's Best Banchan.

676
00:37:07,141 --> 00:37:09,393
It's from Mr. Choi Chi-yeol.

677
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,105
-It's from Mr. Choi?
-Yes.

678
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,190
Lastly,

679
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:15,733
this.

680
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,197
Oh, my goodness.

681
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,114
Unbelievable.

682
00:37:22,198 --> 00:37:23,783
He sure has deep pockets.

683
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,701
What a generous gift.

684
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,870
This is my sincere gift to you.

685
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,288
Please accept it this time.

686
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:30,748
From Choi Chi-yeol.

687
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:33,751
I'm so touched I'm going to cry.

688
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:36,128
What a wonderful young man.

689
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:39,757
I think we should redesign this.

690
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,800
Good morning.

691
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,760
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, sir.

692
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,220
-Carry on.
-Yes, sir.

693
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:47,556
I heard about the All Care Program.

694
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,433
Did you really say yes
to get new blackboards?

695
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:51,477
No way.

696
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,855
I've been concerned about having kids
at different levels in one class.

697
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,025
It'd be more efficient
to set up classes for top students only.

698
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,279
The Director acted
at the right time for once.

699
00:38:01,862 --> 00:38:04,365
Then are we doing
the level test right away?

700
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:05,283
Yes.

701
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:10,454
I'm so touched
by your sincere gift, Mr. Choi.

702
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,248
Thank you so much.

703
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,333
From Nam Haeng-seon
of Nation's Best Banchan.

704
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:17,169
We'll have to pull all-nighters
to get ready for the program.

705
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:18,587
Let's do this.

706
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:21,048
Sure, that's my specialty.

707
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,013
Oh, my.

708
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,682
They posted a notice
about the All Care Program.

709
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,060
Are they really moving it up?

710
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,187
Enrollment begins right away.

711
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,772
What did I tell you?

712
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:38,858
Their director sounded completely hooked.

713
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,152
Hats off to you.

714
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:45,364
She says a word,
and an entire course gets moved up.

715
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,826
This lady here can get things done.

716
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,997
I didn't exactly do much.

717
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:56,125
It just shows
how much influence Suaimdang has.

718
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,127
Same difference.

719
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:01,297
Suaimdang is you, and you're Suaimdang.
So what's the difference?

720
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,590
You're right.

721
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:06,719
Anyway, the level test is tomorrow.
It's such short notice.

722
00:39:06,802 --> 00:39:08,304
There's no time to prepare.

723
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:11,265
I know. For Jin-su's brother,
I hired tutors for the level test.

724
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,559
The kids will have to use
their natural talents.

725
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:16,729
This is a much fairer way
to judge their abilities.

726
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,899
Rather than having the kids
cram and whatnot.

727
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:42,296
Hello?

728
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,173
Hello, Ms. Jang.

729
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:48,386
Have you seen the notice
about the Med School All Care Program?

730
00:39:48,469 --> 00:39:50,096
No, I haven't.

731
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,138
No?

732
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,473
It starts this summer.

733
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,392
The level test is tomorrow.

734
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,893
I pulled some strings.

735
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,813
I see.

736
00:40:00,106 --> 00:40:01,899
Speaking of which,

737
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,235
you know…

738
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:08,072
Can you get your hands
on the previous level tests?

739
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,698
Seo-jin…

740
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,616
I mean,

741
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:13,494
Ms. Jang, you seem to have a way
with getting information.

742
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,289
It's highly likely
that both Sun-jae and Su-a

743
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:20,251
will get into the program anyway.

744
00:40:20,793 --> 00:40:22,795
Why don't we start sharing information?

745
00:40:22,878 --> 00:40:23,921
I'm not sure.

746
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,383
What information
can you give me in return?

747
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:29,760
Well…

748
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,179
That's…

749
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,558
First of all,

750
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,936
I'm the one who moved the program up--

751
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:40,563
But everyone knows that now.

752
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,399
I think we should wait
until after the test.

753
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:45,568
I'm busy. I have to go.

754
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,541
Are you aware
the All Care Program has been moved up?

755
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:01,959
The level test is tomorrow.

756
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:05,671
I'll get you some previous tests,
so study hard until then.

757
00:41:05,754 --> 00:41:08,507
If you fail the test,
our plan will get messed up. Got it?

758
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,467
Okay.

759
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,010
The doors are opening.

760
00:41:19,268 --> 00:41:20,519
The doors are closing.

761
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,776
Are you ever coming home?

762
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,529
What do you care?

763
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,784
Mr. Yang and his wife want to meet us
for a meal in two weeks.

764
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,870
I said yes.

765
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:41,081
Also, Father's birthday dinner.

766
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:42,750
Yurizon Hotel at 7 p.m. tomorrow.

767
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:45,920
-Count us out.
-What are you talking about?

768
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,797
You already put it off a few times.

769
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:51,842
Sun-jae has a level test,
and I'm attending an info session.

770
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,511
There's been a change in schedule.

771
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:55,471
I don't believe you.

772
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:59,141
Do you care about anything
other than your kids' education?

773
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,434
Not at the moment.

774
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:03,020
Sun-jae's education comes first.

775
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,064
That obsession of yours

776
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:07,733
suffocates me and the kids.

777
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:09,527
Look where that got Hui-jae.

778
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,612
Why are you bringing that up right now?

779
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:13,030
The doors are opening.

780
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:19,662
The doors are closing.

781
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:26,544
Enjoy your lunch, ma'am.

782
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,295
-Have a nice day.
-Goodbye!

783
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,762
The customers swarmed in like locusts.

784
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,639
The agujjim was a hit.

785
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,975
The numbers will look good today.

786
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,145
Let's see here.

787
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,525
What are they talking about
on Skymom.net today?

788
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,442
Wait.

789
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:52,444
MED SCHOOL ALL CARE PROGRAM
STARTS EARLY

790
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,822
"Med School All Care Program"?

791
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:56,824
What's this about?

792
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,243
"Med School All Care Program"?

793
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:00,286
Yes.

794
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:03,038
It's the most famous program
the academy offers.

795
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,207
All the moms are leaving
enthusiastic comments.

796
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,627
Are you interested in taking
the level test tomorrow?

797
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:10,379
Me?

798
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:13,465
That class must be expensive.

799
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:15,676
Come on, don't worry about the money.

800
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,303
I'll get a side job if I have to.

801
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,015
Forget it.
We can barely afford the math course.

802
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:21,974
I don't need it.

803
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:23,851
What do you mean?

804
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:27,104
Taking this program is said to be
a sure way to get into med school.

805
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:30,524
All the smart kids are giving it a try.
You should too.

806
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,278
This is new.

807
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:37,531
You didn't even know how mock exams
were graded until a few days ago.

808
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,328
Forget the lousy mom from the past.

809
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:43,954
I am a changed woman now.

810
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,581
Now that we've come this far,

811
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,334
I'm going to become a mom
who's passionate about education.

812
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:52,296
Mom, I have class.
It's a final exam review session.

813
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,213
Okay.

814
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,424
I'll take that as a yes and enroll you.

815
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:02,097
Why is she always so extreme?

816
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,271
Here, you have to find the one
that does not correspond to the graph.

817
00:44:09,355 --> 00:44:11,649
If you read on, the correct answer is D.

818
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,450
All good? Moving on.

819
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:22,701
Okay.

820
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:23,911
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

821
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,121
If you look at C,

822
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:28,874
a "percentage" is
a ratio expressed as a fraction of 100.

823
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,628
I think the correct term here
should be a "percentage point."

824
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,006
The graph shows the difference
between two percentages,

825
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:37,675
not the percentage.

826
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:39,843
Give me just a second.

827
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,138
In that case,
C does not correspond to the graph either

828
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,265
is just as correct.

829
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,812
Well, this is a bit tricky.

830
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,898
Let me discuss it
with the other teachers first.

831
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,316
For now,

832
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,528
I'd say D is the only correct answer.

833
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:58,862
Moving on.

834
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:01,031
Cabbage butterflies…

835
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:03,617
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

836
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,829
Hyo-jin, I want you to finalize
the level test and bring it to me.

837
00:45:06,912 --> 00:45:07,913
It's Hyo-won, sir.

838
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:09,957
Exactly.

839
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,959
Minimize calculus questions.

840
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,585
And leave geometry out.

841
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,671
Test them not on how far they've advanced,

842
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:18,048
but on how well
they understand the material.

843
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:19,633
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

844
00:45:19,716 --> 00:45:21,885
Mr. Ji, you plan the information session.

845
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:24,138
The details of the program
are subject to change

846
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,265
according to changes in admissions.

847
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,642
So don't go too deep into the curriculum.

848
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:31,186
-Focus on how our program is different.
-Yes, sir.

849
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:37,067
This is strange.
He usually comes by around this time.

850
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:38,610
And he still hasn't replied.

851
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:40,571
Who? The star teacher?

852
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:41,697
Yes.

853
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:44,408
Did my text sound weird?

854
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,163
No, I don't think so.

855
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,708
I kept it short
because I wanted to thank him in person.

856
00:45:53,417 --> 00:45:56,378
If you're so curious,
why don't you give him a call?

857
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,631
Should I?

858
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,892
-Hello?
-Hello, Mr. Choi.

859
00:46:09,975 --> 00:46:12,561
No, it's me, Ji Dong-hui.

860
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,939
Hello, Mr. Ji. This is Nation's Best.

861
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,400
Mr. Choi sent me such a kind gift.

862
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,735
I wanted to thank him

863
00:46:19,818 --> 00:46:22,446
and give him a special lunch box,
but he's not here yet.

864
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:24,823
Something urgent came up,
so we've been busy.

865
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:26,867
We'll have to pull an all-nighter.

866
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,037
Oh, my. I see.

867
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,789
-Did you have dinner?
-We had some bread.

868
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:35,250
-Mr. Ji.
-Yes? Just a minute, please!

869
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,085
I have to print something out quickly.

870
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:38,462
See you. Bye.

871
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,131
He must be really busy.

872
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:42,758
He's busy?

873
00:46:42,841 --> 00:46:43,717
Yes.

874
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:46,136
All they had for dinner was some bread.

875
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,098
No matter how busy they are,
they should always have a proper meal.

876
00:46:51,141 --> 00:46:52,518
Actually, this is great.

877
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,770
I felt bad after
receiving such expensive gifts.

878
00:46:54,853 --> 00:46:56,772
I'll whip up some food using what he sent.

879
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,024
You're going out for a delivery?

880
00:46:59,107 --> 00:46:59,942
At this hour?

881
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:01,818
They're pulling an all-nighter.

882
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:04,238
Can you check the address
on Mr. Ji's business card?

883
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,045
Here are some previous level tests.

884
00:47:20,128 --> 00:47:22,089
I heard you applied too.
I hope this helps.

885
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:24,508
Impressive, Sun-jae.

886
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:40,941
What are you doing?

887
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:43,735
You're sharing the tests with Hae-e?

888
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,446
Yes.

889
00:47:46,530 --> 00:47:49,241
-She's taking the level test too--
-Why do you care?

890
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,867
She's a competitor.

891
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:52,869
There are only seven spots in the program.

892
00:47:52,953 --> 00:47:55,831
Did I go through all this trouble
just for you to give them away?

893
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,624
Mom,

894
00:47:57,708 --> 00:47:58,584
Hae-e's a friend.

895
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:00,335
There's no such thing.

896
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,129
Wake up, Sun-jae!

897
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:05,716
She's using you to her advantage.

898
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,510
And look at you,
head over heels for a girl.

899
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,387
Will you please stop?

900
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:13,432
How far are you…

901
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,353
What kind of person
do you want me to become?

902
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:19,855
Tell me.

903
00:48:20,772 --> 00:48:21,607
What?

904
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,276
You know,

905
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,653
you terrify me sometimes.

906
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,585
Just focus on your studies.

907
00:49:01,188 --> 00:49:02,731
Where are you going at this hour?

908
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:23,019
FOR MATH, CHOI CHI-YEOL

909
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,937
Wow.

910
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,189
That's one magnificent building.

911
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:29,025
They're called star teachers for a reason.

912
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,194
Well done, Chi-yeol.

913
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,116
Is this the best possible order?

914
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:37,951
Are you trying to freak out the kids?

915
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,662
Why are all the killer questions
on the front page?

916
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:42,622
And question number 14.

917
00:50:42,706 --> 00:50:44,458
Isn't it from three years ago?

918
00:50:45,584 --> 00:50:47,210
Previous tests are going around.

919
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,504
Repeated questions are not acceptable.

920
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:52,466
They're detestable.

921
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,760
I'm sorry, sir. I'll revise it.

922
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,269
Is this it?

923
00:51:14,279 --> 00:51:15,155
Wow.

924
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,742
Not fingerprint recognition,
but facial recognition?

925
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,993
So cool.

926
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:23,789
Hold on.

927
00:51:24,539 --> 00:51:26,291
I shouldn't interrupt him.

928
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,213
-I think this question should be…
-Goodness.

929
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,717
Hello, ma'am. What brings you here?

930
00:51:35,801 --> 00:51:38,303
I was about to text you and take off.

931
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,554
It's just…

932
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:42,682
I felt too bad
after hearing you skipped dinner.

933
00:51:42,766 --> 00:51:44,976
What's the point of living
if you can't eat?

934
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:49,731
But I'm not saying you should die instead.

935
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,734
You really didn't have to.

936
00:51:52,818 --> 00:51:55,779
I made all of these
with the ingredients Mr. Choi sent.

937
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:57,489
So don't worry. Here.

938
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,325
What's going on?

939
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:02,035
Hello, Mr. Choi.

940
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:05,121
I brought some food over.

941
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,666
You should eat well even if you're busy.

942
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:10,752
I was going to drop it off and leave,
but then I ran into Mr. Ji.

943
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,212
Have you lost your mind?

944
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,464
We're in the middle of writing a test.

945
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:17,425
How could you let
a parent of a student in here?

946
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,011
Will you take responsibility
if the test leaks?

947
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:23,014
I'm sorry. It was careless of me.

948
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:26,601
I think you got the wrong idea.

949
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:30,480
Mr. Ji didn't tell me to come.
It was my own decision.

950
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,983
And I was just going
to drop this off and leave.

951
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:36,444
The test didn't even cross my mind.

952
00:52:36,528 --> 00:52:38,196
I just wanted you to have a meal.

953
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,323
I get it, so leave.
And take that with you.

954
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:43,702
I made a terrible mistake.
I should've known better.

955
00:52:43,785 --> 00:52:44,995
I apologize.

956
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,497
But the food didn't do anything wrong--

957
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:50,083
If you want to be of help, just leave.

958
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:53,086
Get back in here.

959
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,521
You have no idea
how humiliated and frustrated I was.

960
00:53:14,274 --> 00:53:18,153
I simply wanted to return the favor
for his gift.

961
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:21,531
I was going to drop the food off
at the door and leave.

962
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,701
Why would he flip his coin
like I'm some spy?

963
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:26,745
Hey,

964
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:29,247
I'm sorry to point this out,
but it's "flip his lid."

965
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,373
Anyway!

966
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,960
It wouldn't even matter if I had seen it.
I suck at math.

967
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,338
Hey, I get it. Just calm down.

968
00:53:36,838 --> 00:53:39,716
That star teacher must've been on edge
because of the test.

969
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:42,844
Even so,
he didn't have to humiliate me like that.

970
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,471
My first impression was correct.

971
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,306
What a mean, two-faced jerk.

972
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,141
Such a quick change in his attitude.

973
00:53:48,224 --> 00:53:49,059
Hey.

974
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,602
Be quiet.

975
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,313
And I can't eat anymore.

976
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:55,190
I give up.

977
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:56,858
My stomach is about to burst too.

978
00:53:56,942 --> 00:53:59,235
Then what should we do?
We can't throw it away!

979
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,823
I'll focus on the veggies.

980
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,450
I'm on a diet.

981
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:10,288
Yeong-ju, you know elephants
are herbivores too, right?

982
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,541
They don't eat meat,
but they get big because they eat a lot.

983
00:54:13,625 --> 00:54:16,836
They can eat up to 300kg,
but they only excrete 50kg.

984
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:19,005
-So the remaining 250kg--
-Hey.

985
00:54:19,798 --> 00:54:22,133
Did you just call me an elephant?

986
00:54:22,842 --> 00:54:25,095
Forget it if you don't want it.
I'll eat it all.

987
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,638
Give it here!

988
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:31,601
Damn it.

989
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,164
Mom.

990
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:55,917
I'm off to school.

991
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,219
Mom!

992
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,763
Mom!

993
00:55:08,847 --> 00:55:10,890
Hold on. Mom!

994
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,350
Mom, are you okay?

995
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:13,852
Hold on.

996
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,104
Hold on a second.

997
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:21,901
That's all. Get ready for class.

998
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:25,113
Hae-e.

999
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:28,033
Do you know what happened to Sun-jae?

1000
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,410
No, I haven't heard anything.

1001
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,162
I see.

1002
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,663
This isn't like him.

1003
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:39,085
What happened?

1004
00:55:39,753 --> 00:55:40,712
No idea.

1005
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,347
She mixed sleeping pills and alcohol.

1006
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:53,641
We pumped her stomach
and put her on an IV.

1007
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:56,019
She can go home once she wakes up.

1008
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:57,395
Make sure she rests up.

1009
00:55:58,980 --> 00:55:59,981
Thank you.

1010
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:09,908
1:7 ALL CARE PROGRAM
WITH STAR TEACHERS FOR THE TOP 0.01%

1011
00:56:09,991 --> 00:56:11,826
MED SCHOOL ALL CARE PROGRAM LEVEL TEST

1012
00:56:12,994 --> 00:56:14,829
SEATING PLAN
FLOOR 2, EXAM ROOM 1

1013
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:19,209
EXAM ROOM 6, EXAM ROOM 7

1014
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:23,171
Hey.

1015
00:56:23,254 --> 00:56:25,381
I've been meaning to ask you.

1016
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,759
What's with the getup?

1017
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,971
There's a parent information session
for the All Care Program.

1018
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:33,807
Since I don't know the dress code,

1019
00:56:34,808 --> 00:56:36,101
I went classic.

1020
00:56:36,684 --> 00:56:38,394
If you show up dressed like this,

1021
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,772
at least no one will think you're a spy.

1022
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,733
Thinking about yesterday
puts me in a bad mood.

1023
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,069
I still need to go.

1024
00:56:46,152 --> 00:56:48,113
I'm heading to the academy
after a delivery.

1025
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:49,280
Please watch the shop.

1026
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,033
My gosh. Look at you.

1027
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:55,370
A helmet with that outfit?
What a bizarre combination.

1028
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:58,081
Do you know what they call this?

1029
00:56:59,082 --> 00:57:00,416
I heard it on TV yesterday.

1030
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,627
"Mix and match."

1031
00:57:03,545 --> 00:57:04,712
Not "mismatched"?

1032
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:06,297
Darn you.

1033
00:57:23,481 --> 00:57:26,317
There must've been an accident
at the intersection up ahead.

1034
00:57:26,401 --> 00:57:28,278
It'd be faster to ditch the car and run.

1035
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:29,988
But you're the first speaker.

1036
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:31,739
Should we switch up the order?

1037
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,408
It's too last minute.

1038
00:57:34,576 --> 00:57:36,703
Give me a second.
I'll figure something out.

1039
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:05,231
Mr. Choi!

1040
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,318
Why are you here?

1041
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:10,111
I'm on my way to the info session.

1042
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,198
So am I!

1043
00:58:13,281 --> 00:58:15,325
Are you going to run all the way there?

1044
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:17,368
You'll pass out on the way.

1045
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:18,953
You look like you haven't eaten.

1046
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,872
Like I said, you should eat well.

1047
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:31,341
Well?

1048
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,675
Need a lift?

1049
00:58:32,759 --> 00:58:34,010
No, thanks.

1050
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,553
At this rate, you'll be late.

1051
00:58:37,055 --> 00:58:38,348
Just hop on already.

1052
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:41,267
I never give lifts
because I ride for a living,

1053
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:42,727
but this is an emergency.

1054
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,606
Suit yourself.

1055
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,453
Too fast!

1056
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,289
Slow down!

1057
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:05,083
Then you'll be late!

1058
00:59:05,959 --> 00:59:07,126
Hold on tight.

1059
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,381
Goodness.

1060
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:26,104
SEATING PLAN
FLOOR 2, EXAM ROOM 1

1061
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:48,876
Hey, it's me.

1062
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,546
Sun-jae, what happened?
Why didn't you pick up?

1063
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:52,964
Where are you?

1064
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:55,091
I had to take my mom to the hospital.

1065
00:59:55,174 --> 00:59:57,552
I'm on my way,
but I'll need another five minutes.

1066
01:00:01,097 --> 01:00:02,890
I'll stall for time, so run.

1067
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:04,559
Don't give up.

1068
01:00:04,642 --> 01:00:06,019
Got it. I'll be right there.

1069
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:11,232
The exam will start shortly.
Turn off your phones and hand them in.

1070
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:16,529
Safe.

1071
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,619
Go on in.

1072
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:24,579
You don't want to be late after all this.

1073
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:27,874
I owe you one.

1074
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:31,669
Yes, you do.

1075
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:38,718
Isn't that Sun-jae?

1076
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:03,493
I could've sworn my phone was here.

1077
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,704
I'm sorry. Give me one second.

1078
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,290
Gosh, what the heck?

1079
01:01:10,208 --> 01:01:12,460
Why are you waiting for her?
This is unfair.

1080
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:13,878
Just kick her out.

1081
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,132
I'm sorry.

1082
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:19,634
I'm sorry.

1083
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,928
I found my phone.

1084
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,348
I'm sorry.

1085
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:29,727
Thanks.

1086
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:30,937
Good luck.

1087
01:01:32,397 --> 01:01:35,400
The merging of liberal arts
and natural sciences caused a stir.

1088
01:01:35,483 --> 01:01:38,903
But when it comes to math,
the divide is still clear.

1089
01:01:38,986 --> 01:01:39,904
That's right.

1090
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:41,364
There are math electives.

1091
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:44,826
Most schools require
natural science students

1092
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:48,705
to take geometry or calculus as electives.

1093
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:51,165
Electives that you're required to take.

1094
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:53,126
What a paradox.

1095
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,505
"Should my kid take geometry or calculus
to get into med school?"

1096
01:01:57,588 --> 01:01:59,132
"Which one will give
a higher standard score?"

1097
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:00,925
You must be wondering.

1098
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:02,593
No matter which one you choose,

1099
01:02:03,094 --> 01:02:05,346
you must get a perfect score in math

1100
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:07,348
to get into the top med schools.

1101
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:08,891
And that means

1102
01:02:09,642 --> 01:02:11,811
you just need to choose me.

1103
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,024
THE PRIDE ALL CARE PROGRAM
PARENT INFORMATION SESSION

1104
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:33,875
I've parked your car in the garage.

1105
01:02:33,958 --> 01:02:34,959
Thank you.

1106
01:02:35,585 --> 01:02:37,253
How did you arrive on time?

1107
01:02:37,336 --> 01:02:38,755
Did you really run?

1108
01:02:38,838 --> 01:02:41,340
A passing biker gang member
gave me a lift.

1109
01:02:41,924 --> 01:02:43,009
A biker gang member?

1110
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,261
Never mind.

1111
01:02:46,345 --> 01:02:49,265
The test was quite difficult,
but the results are not bad.

1112
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:50,892
Really?

1113
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,061
They seem to have struggled
with question number 29.

1114
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,688
Most of them, at least.

1115
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,859
But some exhibited
excellent problem-solving skills.

1116
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,989

-What?
-You scared me.

1120
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:25,301
What happened? What is it?

1121
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,680
Jae-woo. Yeong-ju.

1122
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,058
Hae-e got in.

1123
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,143
She got into the All Care Program.

1124
01:03:34,727 --> 01:03:35,686
Is that right?

1125
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,189
Congratulations.

1126
01:03:38,272 --> 01:03:40,608
Haeng-seon!

1127
01:03:40,691 --> 01:03:42,193
Yeong-ju!

1128
01:03:42,276 --> 01:03:44,153
Oh, my goodness!

1129
01:03:48,574 --> 01:03:50,785
-Great job!
-I'm so proud.

1130
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:59,961
YOU HAVE BEEN ADMITTED
TO THE PRIDE'S ALL CARE PROGRAM

1131
01:04:00,044 --> 01:04:01,462
I got the text too.

1132
01:04:02,547 --> 01:04:04,131
It still doesn't feel real.

1133
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:06,467
Sun-jae got in too.

1134
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,345
Isn't it amazing, Mom?
I got into the All Care Program.

1135
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:14,892
Seriously.

1136
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,854
Only the best of the best
can get into that program,

1137
01:04:17,937 --> 01:04:19,647
and two of my best friends got in.

1138
01:04:19,730 --> 01:04:22,525
Gosh, I did a great job raising you guys.

1139
01:04:22,608 --> 01:04:24,402
Thank you for raising me.

1140
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:28,030
Are you sure you raised me?
How come you've grown the most?

1141
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:30,283
Hold on. Are you questioning me?

1142
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:31,742
You're so dead. Come here.

1143
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:33,327
-Oh, no!
-Wait!

1144
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,871
-Hey!
-Hae-e!

1145
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:51,262
Can I put my leg down now?

1146
01:04:51,929 --> 01:04:53,180
-Hey.
-Come here.

1147
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,349
-Are you okay?
-Are you okay?

1148
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:56,267
Yes, I'm fine.

1149
01:04:56,809 --> 01:04:58,394
Hey, Seo Geon-hu.

1150
01:05:00,771 --> 01:05:01,939
You're Im…

1151
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,483
Im…

1152
01:05:06,152 --> 01:05:07,695
-Im…
-No.

1153
01:05:07,778 --> 01:05:08,988
-I'm Lee--
-Hold on.

1154
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:09,947
I got this.

1155
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:12,158
Lee…

1156
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:13,117
Jae-jung?

1157
01:05:14,327 --> 01:05:15,828
No, Jae-cheon, right?

1158
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,541
No, I'm Lee Sun-jae.

1159
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:23,753
We've been in the same class
for two years now.

1160
01:05:23,836 --> 01:05:24,670
Really?

1161
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:26,172
You have a very common name.

1162
01:05:26,839 --> 01:05:28,758
Otherwise, I would've remembered.

1163
01:05:31,385 --> 01:05:33,971
Anyway, I thought you were training.

1164
01:05:34,055 --> 01:05:36,015
Isn't that why
you weren't coming to school?

1165
01:05:36,098 --> 01:05:37,850
Not anymore starting today.

1166
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,435
Is the teachers' office this way?

1167
01:05:39,518 --> 01:05:40,561
No.

1168
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:41,771
It's that way.

1169
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,315
Right.

1170
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,947
-Hey.
-Yes?

1171
01:05:51,030 --> 01:05:53,074
Who is he? Do you know him?

1172
01:05:53,574 --> 01:05:55,451
He's in our class. The ice hockey player.

1173
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,829
The one who never comes to school?

1174
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:04,377
What a colorful character. Quite charming.

1175
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,878
Anyway,

1176
01:06:06,587 --> 01:06:07,964
what are you going to do?

1177
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:09,590
What?

1178
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,385
Your back.

1179
01:06:13,761 --> 01:06:15,054
Damn it.

1180
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,347
-I'll dust you off.
-Dust it off.

1181
01:06:16,430 --> 01:06:18,015
-Hold on.
-Dust her off.

1182
01:06:18,099 --> 01:06:19,433
-Wait.
-It's so dirty.

1183
01:06:22,186 --> 01:06:24,522
You said it was your treat,

1184
01:06:25,356 --> 01:06:28,192
so I thought you were taking me
somewhere fancy.

1185
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:31,696
Please understand.
I really need to tighten my belt.

1186
01:06:31,779 --> 01:06:33,948
Money is slipping through my fingers.

1187
01:06:34,031 --> 01:06:35,783
Okay. I understand.

1188
01:06:35,866 --> 01:06:37,952
Congratulations again, Ms. Nam.

1189
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:39,245
Thank you.

1190
01:06:46,627 --> 01:06:49,380
Yeong-ju, it's so funny.

1191
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:52,466
As you know, I wasn't that interested
in Hae-e's education.

1192
01:06:52,550 --> 01:06:54,593
If she gets into college, great.
If not, fine.

1193
01:06:54,677 --> 01:06:56,345
It's her life, after all.

1194
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:58,139
But you know what?

1195
01:06:58,222 --> 01:07:00,391
Now that she's gotten into
the All Care Program,

1196
01:07:01,350 --> 01:07:03,144
I feel so proud.

1197
01:07:03,227 --> 01:07:04,854
I'm exhilarated.

1198
01:07:05,521 --> 01:07:07,898
Remember when we barely made it
to the semifinals

1199
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:09,900
and then went on to win the final?

1200
01:07:09,984 --> 01:07:12,236
I'm getting the same rush of emotions.

1201
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:15,114
And I'm beginning to feel ambitious.

1202
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,198
What is this?

1203
01:07:16,282 --> 01:07:17,575
Same with my mom.

1204
01:07:17,658 --> 01:07:20,161
She used to be adamantly against
me playing handball.

1205
01:07:20,244 --> 01:07:23,039
But when I made the national team,
she put up banners

1206
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,207
and threw a huge party and everything.

1207
01:07:26,125 --> 01:07:27,168
Right.

1208
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:30,337
Maybe all moms are like this.

1209
01:07:35,217 --> 01:07:36,260
Hey, kid.

1210
01:07:36,927 --> 01:07:38,846
You shouldn't litter.

1211
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:43,684
You're obviously a teenager.
You shouldn't be smoking.

1212
01:07:43,768 --> 01:07:45,311
Damn it. What the hell?

1213
01:07:45,895 --> 01:07:48,689
-What?
-Hey, let it go. You

1214
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:51,400
don't want to mess with kids like him.

1215
01:07:51,984 --> 01:07:53,652
I'm letting it slide just this once!

1216
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,196
Sit back down, Haeng-seon.

1217
01:07:57,531 --> 01:07:58,657
Jeez.

1218
01:08:15,674 --> 01:08:16,634
What is it now?

1219
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:24,975
I'm at the study room.

1220
01:08:26,852 --> 01:08:28,062
I'm sorry, Mom.

1221
01:08:29,063 --> 01:08:32,233
This is why I told you
to prepare thoroughly.

1222
01:08:34,318 --> 01:08:36,195
Forget it. You don't have to do anything.

1223
01:08:36,946 --> 01:08:38,405
I'll sort it out.

1224
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:53,379
Hello.

1225
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:55,256
How have you been, Director?

1226
01:08:55,339 --> 01:08:56,715
It's Young-min's mom.

1227
01:09:01,011 --> 01:09:02,555
She must be out celebrating.

1228
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:06,100
Couldn't she at least text me
and let me know?

1229
01:09:07,226 --> 01:09:09,061
I've been starving all day for her food.

1230
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:27,246
Maybe I'll take a walk.

1231
01:09:44,138 --> 01:09:45,890
Yeong-ju.

1232
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:50,102
Yeong-ju, my friend.

1233
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:53,939
-What is it now?
-I'm on cloud nine today.

1234
01:09:54,481 --> 01:09:56,150
Is it okay to be this happy?

1235
01:09:57,359 --> 01:09:58,986
I should be counting my blessings.

1236
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:01,322
I have a smart daughter.

1237
01:10:01,405 --> 01:10:04,074
I have a kind and hard-working brother.

1238
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,911
And I have my best friend here
right next to me!

1239
01:10:06,994 --> 01:10:08,662
Kim Yeong-ju, my loyal friend.

1240
01:10:08,746 --> 01:10:12,208
You know I like you a lot, right?

1241
01:10:12,291 --> 01:10:14,043
Gosh, get off me.

1242
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:15,294
Seriously.

1243
01:10:15,836 --> 01:10:18,547
You're drunk again.

1244
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,549
I'm having a flashback.

1245
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,677
Our team dinner
after we won the championship.

1246
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:27,890
You got drunk like this
and showered everyone with kisses.

1247
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:29,892
I'm reliving that moment right now.

1248
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,143
I mean it!

1249
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,772
I really, really like you.

1250
01:10:36,607 --> 01:10:38,567
Get off me!

1251
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:43,656
I get it, so quit grabbing me.

1252
01:10:43,739 --> 01:10:46,283
Why? I like you so much.

1253
01:10:46,367 --> 01:10:48,369
-I mean it.
-I get it.

1254
01:10:48,452 --> 01:10:49,620
Get off me!

1255
01:10:50,204 --> 01:10:51,121
You brat.

1256
01:10:51,205 --> 01:10:52,081
Hold on.

1257
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:54,583
Mr. Choi!

1258
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,712
Mr. Choi Chi-yeol!

1259
01:11:00,172 --> 01:11:02,675
Thank you, Mr. Choi!

1260
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,176
I mean it.

1261
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:06,679
Thank you so much!

1262
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:10,391
You know I really like you, right?

1263
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:12,518
Hold on!

1264
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,222
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1265
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,724
Admissions is a long fight.

1266
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,518
And I hope all of you become winners.

1267
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:58,605
There's one student who might not be
at the same level as our kids.

1268
01:11:58,689 --> 01:12:01,900
So exactly what is your plan?

1269
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,444
Hey!

1270
01:12:03,527 --> 01:12:04,486
-Please calm down.
-Move.

1271
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:08,198
Don't leave like this.
It's not like you'll never see her again.

1272
01:12:08,282 --> 01:12:10,075
She turns into a lunatic
when she gets mad.

1273
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,702
When she goes crazy,
she becomes downright insane.

1274
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:14,580
I officially request a meeting!

1275
01:12:15,998 --> 01:12:17,750
Wait. Where are you going?

1276
01:12:22,713 --> 01:12:27,718
