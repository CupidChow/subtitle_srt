00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:00,977
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

2
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,520
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

3
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,486
Can I really trust her?

4
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,697
She's the very opposite of discreet.

5
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,493
If people were to find out
I'm offering private tutoring…

6
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,370
Darn it. My hands are trembling.

7
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,083
What is he talking about
after showing up out of the blue?

8
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,460
I need to pull myself together.

9
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,379
You have to be wary
of the clever and sly sort.

10
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,507
Private tutoring from Choi Chi-yeol?
Nonsense.

11
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:33,676
First of all, as for tutoring fees--

12
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,969
Hold on a minute.

13
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:37,222
Before we get into that,

14
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:41,518
let me get something straight first.

15
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,479
It's true that I'm the owner of this shop,

16
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,607
but don't let that lead you to believe…

17
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:51,486
that I own this entire building
or anything.

18
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,862
Because that's not true.

19
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,782
I'm renting the place cheaply
because it's so old.

20
00:01:56,366 --> 00:01:59,953
And since I don't skimp on ingredients,
I'm barely breaking even.

21
00:02:01,538 --> 00:02:03,373
I'm telling you all this

22
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:06,626
because we can't have a fair price lego
without you knowing--

23
00:02:06,709 --> 00:02:08,711
"Lego" is a toy.

24
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:10,505
It's "negotiation."

25
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,094
I won't charge you anything
for my tutoring.

26
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:19,806
-Then--
-Ever heard of the Private Teaching Act?

27
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:22,934
To become a paid tutor,
you must report to the authorities first.

28
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,228
It's illegal to get paid
without reporting.

29
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,772
I see. I've never heard of that.

30
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,899
Gosh.

31
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,611
That's a smart law
made by some smart people.

32
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:34,696
I like it.

33
00:02:34,779 --> 00:02:38,116
Then what can I do for you in return?

34
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,871
Your job.

35
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,372
-My job?
-Lunch boxes.

36
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:46,291
Sell them to me again.

37
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:47,584
Twice a day.

38
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:51,880
I want my brunch to be made
and delivered to my door the same day.

39
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:54,132
And I'll pick up dinner from you
on my way home.

40
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:55,758
Of course.

41
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,844
But what do you mean, "sell"?
It'll be free.

42
00:02:57,927 --> 00:02:59,512
-Including delivery.
-No.

43
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:01,514
I insist on paying full price.

44
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:04,434
Free food is considered
unlawful economic gain.

45
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:08,688
But still…

46
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,442
it'd be shameless of me
to say yes to that.

47
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,319
It probably would.

48
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,238
But I find unlawful activities detestable.

49
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,239
Just think of it as

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,243
taking charge of my meals.

51
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,662
You'll be my personal chef, so to speak.

52
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:26,873
Well…

53
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,084
If you insist,

54
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,085
sure.

55
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:33,171
-What else?
-Secondly,

56
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,757
I get to schedule our classes.

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,884
On weekdays when I have one evening class,

58
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,511
I'll tutor her for 30 minutes after work.

59
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,972
Classes can be canceled
due to all-nighters.

60
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,557
On weekends, I'm fully booked.

61
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:45,767
As for the location…

62
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,563
In order to protect my privacy
and reduce travel time,

63
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,149
-I suggest your house.
-Sure. Deal.

64
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,277
I wouldn't feel comfortable
sending my girl to your place.

65
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:00,949
-What is that supposed to mean?
-I'm just saying.

66
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:01,950
Let's move on.

67
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:03,910
What else? Is there anything more?

68
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,246
Thirdly,

69
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:08,456
and most importantly…

70
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,253
You must keep this a secret.

71
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,215
I have a greater influence
over the world of private education

72
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,467
than you can possibly imagine.

73
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,094
Choi Chi-yeol tutoring a student?

74
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,265
If word gets out,

75
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,393
Korea's college admissions
will turn upside down.

76
00:04:29,435 --> 00:04:31,145
Your family can be an exception,

77
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:33,523
but don't even tell your closest friend.

78
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,483
I'll keep it a secret from Mr. Ji too.

79
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,402
Is that really necessary?

80
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,861
You still don't understand?

81
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:40,530
I have a greater influence over--

82
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,573
I get it. I get what you mean.

83
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:45,285
But you're really going to these lengths

84
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,537
just for my food?

85
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,998
I'm not slow or anything,

86
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,543
but I can't wrap my head around this.

87
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,422
Yes, it's for your food.

88
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,591
Anyway, those are my conditions, Ms. Nam…

89
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,095
Haeng-sun.

90
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,514
It's Haeng-seon.

91
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:09,225
Nam Haeng-seon.

92
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:11,644
It has nothing to do
with that famous song.

93
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:12,729
Right.

94
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,147
Ms. Nam Haeng…

95
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,148
seon.

96
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:16,816
All right.

97
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,151
It's fine with me.

98
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:19,944
Deal.

99
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,240
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

100
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:31,247
-Look.
-Yes?

101
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,418
Do you have any leftovers from today?

102
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,033
Have some water.

103
00:06:41,859 --> 00:06:44,987
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

104
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:51,994
THE SECRET PROBABILITY
DISTRIBUTION OF X AND Y

105
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,164
EPISODE 5

106
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:04,465
EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES

107
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,554
-Step back.
-Back up.

108
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,722
Step back, please.

109
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,101
Please don't touch that.

110
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:17,186
You can't enter. Step away.

111
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:19,355
Make way for the ambulance.

112
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,023
-Are you in charge?
-Make way.

113
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:25,236
-You can't enter.
-Step back.

114
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,116
-You can't come in here.
-Don't touch that.

115
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,203
Are you his mother?

116
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:36,914
-No.
-Then you can't enter.

117
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,875
Mr. Choi? Really?

118
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,878
He's giving me private tutoring?

119
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,421
Yes.

120
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,547
You can't believe it?

121
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,508
He even gave me his address
for the deliveries.

122
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,135
No way.

123
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,095
Mr. Choi will be my tutor?

124
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:54,348
And who's the one
who made the impossible possible?

125
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,100
-Nam Haeng-seon.
-That's right.

126
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:58,561
Calm down and eat up.

127
00:07:59,061 --> 00:08:00,938
Before your uncle eats it all.

128
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,065
These are so sweet and juicy. So good.

129
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:06,611
Star teachers rarely offer
private tutoring.

130
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,237
To be exact, it's not private tutoring.

131
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,490
You could say
it's a form of skill exchange.

132
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:13,242
Anyway, it's top secret.

133
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,369
It stays between us and Mr. Choi. Got it?

134
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,455
Especially you, Jae-woo.

135
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,500
You can't tell Yeong-ju any of this, okay?

136
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,005
I really can't trust him. Hold on.

137
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,091
Hey. Look at me.

138
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:31,302
Let's pretend I'm Yeong-ju.

139
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,764
Jae-woo.

140
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,725
Didn't the star teacher
just go into your house?

141
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:39,477
What is he doing there?

142
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,978
-He's tutoring Hae-e.
-Jeez!

143
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:42,939
I just told you it's a secret.

144
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,190
You have to deny it!

145
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:45,441
"Are you seeing things?"

146
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,276
"Are your eyes aging? Get a checkup!"

147
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,278
"You must be seeing things."

148
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,821
"Are your eyes aging? Get a checkup!"

149
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:52,031
There you go.

150
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,077
I'll be extremely careful,
so you two must cooperate.

151
00:08:56,577 --> 00:08:59,956
For Hae-e's college admissions
and her bright future.

152
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:01,958
Bring it in.

153
00:09:14,262 --> 00:09:15,429
Mom,

154
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:16,764
can I sleep here tonight?

155
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,641
What's gotten into you?

156
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,851
You've refused to
sleep next to me for years.

157
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,857
Come here.

158
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,916
It's been such a long time.

159
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,044
I love this. So nice and awkward.

160
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,047
I don't feel awkward at all.

161
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:55,261
I really must've grown a lot.

162
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:58,556
This blanket used to be too long for me.

163
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:01,142
Yes, you've grown so much.

164
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:04,854
Time really does fly.

165
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,568
You didn't watch any horror movies today.

166
00:10:11,944 --> 00:10:14,363
There's no thunder or lightning either.
So what is it?

167
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:16,032
Do you have something to tell me?

168
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:18,868
No.

169
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,662
Mom,

170
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,873
be honest with me.

171
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,250
-What do you mean?
-I mean Mr. Choi's tutoring.

172
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,169
Are you sure it's free?

173
00:10:29,003 --> 00:10:31,380
Why would he tutor me
unless you paid him a fortune?

174
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,344
You didn't take out a mortgage
or anything, did you?

175
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:38,012
Did you go to a loan shark?

176
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,221
No.

177
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:42,391
He'll tutor you for free
as long as I sell my food to him.

178
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:47,063
Apparently, he's a picky eater
and has trouble eating.

179
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,233
Wait. Are you looking down on my cooking?

180
00:10:51,317 --> 00:10:52,902
No, it's not like that.

181
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,031
It just feels like a dream.

182
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,741
Just enjoy it then.

183
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,951
You tend to think too much.

184
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:03,621
Is it to compensate for
your thoughtless family?

185
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,459
Go to sleep. I'll tuck you in.

186
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,591
I'm going to study really hard.

187
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,136
This is such a rare opportunity.

188
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:21,806
Right.

189
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:25,476
Maybe life is fair after all.

190
00:11:27,269 --> 00:11:28,813
Misfortune is often followed

191
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,065
by a stroke of luck.

192
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,318
Don't you agree?

193
00:11:58,134 --> 00:11:59,802
She can take my classes

194
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,846
in private.

195
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,055
Gosh.

196
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:05,641
Did I go overboard?

197
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,477
Private tutoring?

198
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:10,980
What am I,

199
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,357
a fighter for justice?

200
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:17,236
That's not true.

201
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:18,946
This is in my best interest too.

202
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,614
Eating is a serious matter.

203
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,451
I get to eat, and she gets to study.

204
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:24,743
It'll benefit both of us.

205
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,163
That's right.

206
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:29,999
I'm doing the right thing.

207
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,049
Is this a food coma?

208
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,555
I need to wash up.

209
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,393
But I'm so sleepy.

210
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,671
What is it?

211
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,882
I'm sorry to wake you up.

212
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,468
But I thought you should know.

213
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,347
What's wrong? What happened?

214
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,599
DO NOT CROSS

215
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:30,100
Certainly not a good morning.

216
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,853
How could this happen?

217
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:34,605
I know.

218
00:13:35,147 --> 00:13:38,734
You hear about these incidents
in this area every so often,

219
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:40,986
but at our academy building,
of all places?

220
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,033
Should we cancel classes?

221
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,286
Let's talk inside.

222
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:56,835
Hello, Reporter Seo.

223
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:00,005
Please leave out the name of our academy.

224
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,632
We have a business to run.

225
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,635
If you don't like my class, leave.

226
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:06,512
Don't bother the other students.

227
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:08,097
Damn it.

228
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,659
Hello?

229
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,829
Hello, this is Detective Song I-tae
from Ganghyeon Police Station.

230
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,330
Is this Mr. Choi Chi-yeol?

231
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:38,711
It seems like the last class
he took yesterday was yours.

232
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:40,421
I mean the deceased Lee Young-min.

233
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,797
That's correct.

234
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,008
Did anything unusual happen?

235
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:45,968
Was he more on edge than usual?

236
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,306
I did tell him off for giving me attitude.

237
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,433
But I'm not sure what he was usually like.

238
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,352
I teach large classes.

239
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:57,897
-It's hard to get to know each student.
-I see.

240
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:01,233
Did you go straight home after class?

241
00:15:02,526 --> 00:15:04,820
No. I stopped by a side dish shop nearby.

242
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:05,821
At that late hour?

243
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,239
What's the shop called?

244
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,866
Hey. You…

245
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:12,703
You don't have to answer that.

246
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:15,205
Thank you for your time, sir.

247
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:18,292
We'll get in touch with you
if we have more questions.

248
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,419
Let's go.

249
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,764
Classes during the break,
and now cleaning?

250
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,182
Our school is the worst.

251
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:37,686
What is it?

252
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:39,104
Is something bothering you?

253
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,106
Spit it out already.

254
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,320
I'm just wondering
what you're going to do.

255
00:15:47,237 --> 00:15:48,530
What do you mean?

256
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:50,950
What Seo Geon-hu asked yesterday.

257
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:54,119
Are you going to say yes?

258
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:58,290
Exactly. I'd love to know too.

259
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,545
You haven't answered me, Hae-e.

260
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,510
Are you helping me or not?

261
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:12,972
With my studies.

262
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:16,016
What exactly do you want me to do?

263
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,477
And why me?

264
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,604
If you want to study, go to an academy

265
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:22,314
-or find a tutor--
-It's because

266
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:26,026
I want to test myself first.

267
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,323
All I've been doing is sports.
I've never really studied.

268
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,285
So I'm thinking of it as a little warm-up.

269
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,205
If I dive in headfirst,

270
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:41,417
I might disappoint my mom again.

271
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:45,546
Fine, let's do it.

272
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:48,298
I'll help you.

273
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,968
But you have to listen to me.

274
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:53,595
Now, pick up the trash.

275
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,305
Okay.

276
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,057
Yes, ma'am.

277
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,941
Will you be okay?

278
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,818
What do you mean?

279
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,403
I mean Seo Geon-hu.

280
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:12,823
Why waste your time on him?
You're busy with your studies.

281
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,743
It's fine. He just needs a little advice.

282
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:19,997
I have more time over the break,
and I might learn by teaching him too.

283
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,665
But still…

284
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,753
What?

285
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,838
I wonder what happened.

286
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,882
-This has never happened.
-What is it?

287
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,718
The academy canceled all classes today.

288
00:17:32,801 --> 00:17:33,844
Guys!

289
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,138
Did you guys hear?

290
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:37,973
At the academy yesterday…

291
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,810
A male student in 11th grade
jumped off a large academy building

292
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:45,272
on Nokeun-ro, Seoul, last night
and passed away.

293
00:17:45,355 --> 00:17:46,732
An investigation is underway.

294
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,110
-After taking a class…
-My goodness. That's horrible.

295
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,321
Hey, look.

296
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:54,281
Isn't that The Pride Academy?

297
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:58,327
That young boy
must've been under extreme stress.

298
00:17:59,453 --> 00:18:00,871
He was in the All Care Program.

299
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:02,998
All Care?

300
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,125
The one Hae-e had gotten into?

301
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:07,127
SKYMOM.NET
WAS IT SUICIDE?

302
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,004
That hits too close to home.

303
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:10,297
I feel terrible.

304
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,716
Goodness.

305
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,134
How could this happen?

306
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,597
Anyway, why is it so hard
to have a meal with you?

307
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,683
It's because Ms. Jang is
competent and successful.

308
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:25,562
Mr. Lee, you're a lucky man.

309
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:26,772
Am I?

310
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,817
I guess I am.

311
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,569
Right.

312
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,196
I saw the news this morning.

313
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,031
Another incident in your neighborhood.

314
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,616
It's so tragic.

315
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,078
College admissions must
seriously stress kids out.

316
00:18:41,161 --> 00:18:44,081
Well, the competition is quite fierce.

317
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,709
Still, both of your kids
are doing amazing.

318
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:49,503
They definitely take after you two.

319
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,714
How's your eldest doing
at his Ivy League school?

320
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:55,050
Which school was it?

321
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,552
-Well…
-Columbia, ma'am.

322
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,179
He seems to be struggling to keep up.

323
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,640
He whines every time we call him.

324
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:12,359
I'm sorry, but I have to get going.

325
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,654
I'm meeting with other moms
to discuss my youngest's academy.

326
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:17,531
Sure.

327
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,334
I'm sorry I'm late.

328
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,295
I had another appointment.

329
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,297
Don't worry. We just got here too.

330
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,258
I can't believe what happened.

331
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,135
On the first day of the program, at that.

332
00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,636
Exactly.

333
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,514
My heart jumped at the news.

334
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:45,392
I still feel jittery.

335
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,768
Same here.

336
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,979
He wasn't my kid,

337
00:19:49,062 --> 00:19:52,691
but he was in the same program
as my daughter.

338
00:19:52,774 --> 00:19:55,819
What a horrible tragedy.

339
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,571
But I, for one,

340
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,450
think canceling classes was a bad idea.

341
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:05,287
The kids were going to find out anyway
and be shocked and scared.

342
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,663
But no classes to go to?

343
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,541
It'll only make them more anxious.

344
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,793
They can't focus at home.

345
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,670
I agree with you.

346
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,422
If the kids are left on their own,

347
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:18,008
-they'll only be more perturbed.
-Absolutely.

348
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,468
Still,

349
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,470
their classmate just died.

350
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,805
Holding classes today is a bit…

351
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,810
What difference does it make
if they take a couple of days off?

352
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:32,606
It'd be best to pretend
as if nothing happened

353
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:36,568
and help them get back into their studies.

354
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,112
Then what should we do?

355
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,823
The academy has already announced
the class cancellations.

356
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,202
We'll have to ask them
to hold classes as usual.

357
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:48,705
The academy will be in shambles today.

358
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:50,791
There will be police officers too.

359
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,042
We'll ask them to leave,

360
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,418
at least during class.

361
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:54,836
I'll talk to the academy.

362
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:57,589
If I say the All Care moms
are unanimous on this,

363
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:59,341
the director will have to listen.

364
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,555
It seems like it really was suicide.

365
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,266
There are articles that confirm it.

366
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:10,018
What did the detective say?

367
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:12,479
What?

368
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,855
The questioning was just a formality.

369
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,607
Since the boy was in my class.

370
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:19,278
You must be shaken up.

371
00:21:21,238 --> 00:21:22,531
Classes are canceled, right?

372
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,241
I'll go home and rest.

373
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,242
All right.

374
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,331
Hello, Vice Director?

375
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,418
Sorry?

376
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,881
One moment, please.

377
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,634
Mr. Choi.

378
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:46,638
The All Care moms are demanding
we hold classes as usual.

379
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,098
What would you like to do?

380
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:50,767
Should I say you can't do it?

381
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,816
No, I'll do it.

382
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:00,485
This is life or death for the kids.

383
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:02,696
Every second counts until the CSAT.

384
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,575
I can't afford to waste
their precious time.

385
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,079
Hello?

386
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,164
He said yes.

387
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,832
Bye.

388
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,299
Keep it up.

389
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:25,010
Hello, Ms. Nam. It's us again.

390
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:27,637
-Hello.
-Welcome.

391
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,389
-What do we have today?
-Really?

392
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,893
So Mr. Choi said yes?

393
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,063
I see.

394
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:37,314
Please announce it then.

395
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,399
Bye.

396
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:42,652
So the All Care classes
will be held as usual?

397
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,072
What else can they do
when the moms demand it?

398
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:49,326
Regardless of what happened,
the kids need to study.

399
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:54,414
Gosh, I can't believe them.

400
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,876
How can they do this?

401
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:03,006
They care more about their kids' studies
than a kid's death?

402
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:05,509
Are they even human?

403
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,762
I don't know what to say.

404
00:23:08,845 --> 00:23:10,889
Asking for classes on a day like this?

405
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:13,433
Fine, let's say the moms
are just being selfish,

406
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:15,102
but the kids don't deserve this.

407
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:19,064
How can they study
when their classmate just died?

408
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,026
I feel sorry for the teachers too.

409
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:24,111
Exactly.

410
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:27,239
Our Mr. Choi must be distressed.

411
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,199
"Our Mr. Choi"?

412
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,743
You're being a bit excessive.

413
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,203
You used to hate his guts.

414
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,788
Hey!

415
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,958
That's not the issue here.

416
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,127
We didn't even know the boy,
and we feel awful.

417
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:43,213
Gosh, damn studies.

418
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,734
Are you okay, Mr. Choi?

419
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,945
You must be very shaken up.

420
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:10,031
We can put off Hae-e's first class
until next week if you want.

421
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,704
No.

422
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,330
I'll start tomorrow as promised.

423
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,127
He sure is a professional.

424
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:26,381
But how come
I'm sensing agony from his text?

425
00:24:27,591 --> 00:24:28,675
What did you say?

426
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:30,594
I was just talking to myself.

427
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,220
Go.

428
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:36,099
THE PRIDE ACADEMY

429
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,283
We're starting
with question number 15, right?

430
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:55,952
Shall we begin?

431
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,622
Let's name these two angles alpha.

432
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,457
Since they're congruent,

433
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,794
these two line segments

434
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:07,464
must also be congruent.

435
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,091
As the question describes, AB and AC

436
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:11,885
are 3K

437
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:13,678
and 4K respectively.

438
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,681
Which rule applies to these two triangles?

439
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,479
The cosine rule, of course.

440
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,105
Let's see here.

441
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,818
That's it. One more time.

442
00:25:31,154 --> 00:25:32,614
In this case, what's K?

443
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,531
K equals…

444
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,576
one.

445
00:25:37,118 --> 00:25:38,453
The cosine value would be…

446
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:42,415
seven over eight.

447
00:25:46,586 --> 00:25:47,629
Let's move on.

448
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,638
You won't make a lot of profit

449
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,556
if you use such high-quality meat.

450
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,808
How much do you need?

451
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,309
Just one geun, please.

452
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,435
What?

453
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:09,354
I thought it was for your customers.

454
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:10,730
It is.

455
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:13,817
But starting today,
I have to prepare a special lunch box.

456
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,943
My goodness.

457
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,903
So Nation's Best has a VIP?

458
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:17,987
No way.

459
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,572
A VIP would be an understatement.

460
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,242
He's my VVVVVIP.

461
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,329
My gosh!

462
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:28,331
Mr. Choi?

463
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,000
Were you here all night?

464
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:32,127
No.

465
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:38,466
I went for a jog for the first time
in forever, and I'm beat.

466
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,884
It was a bad idea.

467
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,303
My body feels like jelly.

468
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:45,473
You're early, Hyo-jin.

469
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,058
It's Hyo-won, sir.

470
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,477
I always come early
when you have early classes.

471
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,605
This is for your CSAT repeater class.

472
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,774
This is for your evening class
for seniors.

473
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:56,985
-Do you need anything else?
-No.

474
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:59,529
-Right, tutoring materials.
-Sorry?

475
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,697
-What?
-What did you say?

476
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,365
-Me?
-You need what?

477
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,534
What materials?

478
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,454
-I don't need anything else.
-Oh, okay.

479
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:10,540
Hyo-jin.

480
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,626
Is my computer connected to the printer?

481
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,503
Probably not.

482
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:17,464
We always do all the printing for you.

483
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:19,632
That's right.

484
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,302
Which I appreciate.

485
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,763
I'm always grateful.

486
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,139
On that note…

487
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:29,768
Why don't you go grab some coffee?

488
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,519
Have a croissant too.

489
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:34,105
Take your time and eat there.

490
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,982
Got it. Thank you, sir!

491
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,463
CHOI CHI-YEOL MATH ACADEMY

492
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,842
ALL CARE PROGRAM TEST 1, LEE HYO-WON

493
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:21,945
Hey.

494
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:24,656
Want to switch seats?

495
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:30,745
Deal?

496
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:42,215
What are you doing?

497
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:45,051
This is how motivated I am to study.

498
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,095
I'm going to shadow you.

499
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,641
Hey, look at question number two here.

500
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,685
It's on circular measure or whatever.

501
00:30:53,768 --> 00:30:56,229
What does this mean?
I don't understand the question.

502
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:59,148
This is pretty basic.

503
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,236
You know what pi is, right?

504
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,780
Pi?

505
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:07,615
Like Wi-Pi?

506
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,785
You really don't know pi?

507
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,371
Is that something I should know?

508
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,250
It's no big deal.

509
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:19,210
It's fine.

510
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:20,670
Let's see here.

511
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:24,424
Pi is the ratio of the circumference
of a circle to its diameter, 3.14.

512
00:31:26,467 --> 00:31:27,427
Just memorize it.

513
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,429
Here, look at this.

514
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,056
-See what it says in the parentheses?
-Yes.

515
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,700
How's the studying going?

516
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,161
Not great.

517
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,121
I'm falling asleep.

518
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,001
Hae-e told me to wash my face and wake up.

519
00:32:00,084 --> 00:32:01,628
Let me ask you something.

520
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,504
Why Nam Hae-e though?

521
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,090
Why her?

522
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:08,551
-And not me or Su-a?
-Su-a?

523
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,096
You mean the arrogant one.

524
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,266
I thought she was homeroom rep at first
because she's so bossy.

525
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,062
-You're changing the subject.
-No one's changing the subject.

526
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:24,984
Do you have a crush on Hae-e?

527
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:28,279
Yes.

528
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,490
I do.

529
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:32,659
I see.

530
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:34,869
Answer my question.

531
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,997
Well, I don't know.

532
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:41,084
Maybe I have a crush on her too.

533
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:49,300
What? The case will be closed?

534
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,927
You didn't hear?

535
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,055
No obvious injuries, no sign of struggle.

536
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:56,265
And his family objects to an autopsy.

537
00:32:57,433 --> 00:32:59,978
The higher-ups want to conclude
it was suicide.

538
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:02,772
Still, what's the rush?

539
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:04,816
Something's fishy.

540
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,442
What is it now?

541
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:07,819
That boy, Lee Young-min.

542
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,487
If he was going to kill himself,

543
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,615
why would he post a picture like this
just a few hours beforehand?

544
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,494
Maybe he was putting on an act.

545
00:33:16,577 --> 00:33:19,664
He'd also often posted
that he hated studying and wanted to die.

546
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,291
That's just what all kids say.

547
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,211
He didn't even leave a note or anything.

548
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,963
Do you know what's even stranger?

549
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:27,922
Look at this.

550
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,424
See the wound on his forehead?

551
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:32,844
He didn't have it in the previous picture,
but here, he does.

552
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:37,807
His grandfather is an assemblyman.

553
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:40,518
He wants this case over with
to prevent any more gossip.

554
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,438
Just sweep it under the rug.

555
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,439
Goodness.

556
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:47,650
Unbelievable.

557
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,570
Is he a detective or a cleaner?

558
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,280
He sweeps everything under the rug.

559
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,490
Hey, don't be like that.

560
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:57,535
Until ten years ago,
he was known as "The Bulldozer."

561
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,245
He was?

562
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:00,830
Yes.

563
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:04,250
Remember the middle school boy
who allegedly killed his mother?

564
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:07,837
Detective Song was convinced
that the boy was the killer

565
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,797
and managed to get him indicted.

566
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,719
Given the nature of the incident,
the boy's identity was disclosed,

567
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:19,265
and the entire nation bashed him,
even the president.

568
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:23,603
But guess what?
The Supreme Court acquitted him.

569
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:25,730
He was the one in charge of that case?

570
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,649
He suffered greatly afterward.

571
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:32,445
He went with his gut,
but the verdict wasn't on his side.

572
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,447
He was branded as the evil detective

573
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:37,408
who falsely accused a poor boy
that had lost his family.

574
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:40,912
He's become more and more
lethargic ever since.

575
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,414
Now he sweeps things under the rug
whenever he can.

576
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:45,583
Why isn't this working?

577
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:59,722
MURDER CASE OF A MIDDLE SCHOOLER'S MOM
GANGHYEON POLICE STATION

578
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:21,369
-Goodbye.
-See you.

579
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,955
-Bye.
-I'll have more ready by tonight.

580
00:35:24,038 --> 00:35:26,415
-Namul, pollack jeon, and soybean soup.
-Hello.

581
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,334
-That'll be 17,500 won.
-Okay.

582
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,252
I'm off.

583
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:34,340
We're so busy today.
You'll be a millionaire soon.

584
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,758
Fingers crossed.

585
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:40,096
My stomach suddenly hurts.
I'll use the bathroom upstairs.

586
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:41,139
Sure. Make it quick.

587
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,558
Okay. I must've eaten
too much jeon earlier.

588
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,019
Today is Hae-e's first class.

589
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:49,313
But I haven't had time to clean.

590
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,440
And I had so many customers today.

591
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,484
I need to hurry up.

592
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,963
Hey, Yeong-ju sent me
to check if you had died…

593
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:15,590
It's clean.

594
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,425
Really clean.

595
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,594
Our house is sparkling clean!

596
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,930
THE PRIDE ACADEMY

597
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,640
That's it for today.

598
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,060
Be sure to review the questions
that I emphasized today.

599
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,233
Guys.

600
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,695
Have you ever heard of "math anxiety"?

601
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,574
When you see math questions,
your heart starts to race

602
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:43,534
and your armpits get sweaty.

603
00:36:45,161 --> 00:36:48,664
Math anxiety is purely psychological.

604
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,792
It has nothing to do
with your actual skills.

605
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:54,629
It only happens

606
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:57,089
because you think math is difficult.

607
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,090
In other words,

608
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,968
you're not anxious
because you're bad at math.

609
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:03,054
You have trouble thinking mathematically

610
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,014
because you're anxious.

611
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,893
Isn't life the same?

612
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,730
"Life is tough and painful."

613
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,232
"This is a living hell."

614
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:17,318
Dwelling on those fears
will really turn your life into hell.

615
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,781
"Life is enjoyable and wonderful."

616
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:24,116
"Tough times will pass."

617
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,327
If you tell yourself that,

618
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,955
it'll soothe your anxiety.

619
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:31,958
On that note,

620
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:35,544
let's shout, "Math is awesome!"
three times before we go.

621
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:38,756
That's too silly.

622
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,841
That's a terrible idea.

623
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,134
Math is what?

624
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,679
-Awesome!
-Awesome!

625
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,192
-Great work, sir.
-Great work, sir.

626
00:37:59,193 --> 00:38:00,653
I loved that last bit.

627
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:03,823
It seemed to make the kids finally relax
after being tense all day.

628
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,325
They sure seemed tense today.

629
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,495
For good reason though,
considering what happened here last night.

630
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,790
They say kids these days
are self-absorbed,

631
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,166
but they're still kids.

632
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,961
You speak coldly,
but you do care about them a lot.

633
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:19,505
You must be hungry. I'll drive.

634
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:21,549
I found a place
that's open until late and--

635
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,676
No, thanks. I'll eat something later.

636
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:24,635
You can go home.

637
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:26,053
They've got rave reviews.

638
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,764
Next time.

639
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:31,100
Make sure to eat.

640
00:38:36,522 --> 00:38:37,565
Going down.

641
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:48,868
Hello, Mr. Choi!

642
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:56,042
Why?

643
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,212
Come in.

644
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,631
Come on in.

645
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:14,393
Come in.

646
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:19,565
-Hello, Mr. Choi.
-Hello.

647
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,109
This is where we live.

648
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:27,073
I've been working since early morning,
so I haven't had time to clean.

649
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,700
Let me show you around.

650
00:39:29,784 --> 00:39:31,535
That's my room over there.

651
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,496
And this is my brother's room.

652
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:37,041
It used to be a utility room,
but I turned it into an extra room.

653
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,794
I did everything myself,
from plastering to painting,

654
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,296
-with help from Jae-woo and Hae-e--
-Where's her room?

655
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,340
It's right here.

656
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,468
Mr. Choi.

657
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:51,097
Would you like to drink
sikhye or sujeonggwa?

658
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,431
We have unsweetened juice--

659
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,933
-I'll have water.
-Water it is.

660
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:57,978
He won't let me finish my sentences.

661
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:03,526
He's not wearing the tiger jacket today.

662
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:04,777
It looked so cool.

663
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,491
My desk is too small,
so my mom set this table up.

664
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:11,992
Okay.

665
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:18,332
We don't have AC.

666
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:19,667
Should I turn off the fan?

667
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,003
I'll do it.

668
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,964
Thank you.

669
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,094
Shall we get started?

670
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,053
Sure.

671
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,061
Excuse me.

672
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:45,526
Why did you turn off the fan?
He must be hot.

673
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,862
That's fine. The noise bothers me.

674
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,405
I see. Then what should we do?

675
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:52,199
Should I fan you while you teach her?

676
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,994
-Look, Ms. Ho Nam-seon.
-It's Nam Haeng-seon.

677
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:56,370
Nam Haeng-seon.

678
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:58,706
I already told you not to mix them up.

679
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:00,249
Right.

680
00:41:00,332 --> 00:41:01,709
Ms. Nam Haeng-seon.

681
00:41:03,252 --> 00:41:04,920
Do you know what my nickname is?

682
00:41:06,505 --> 00:41:07,798
I'm not sure.

683
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,676
King of Math?

684
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,179
-Superstar?
-Wrong.

685
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:15,306
The Trillion Won Man.

686
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:17,183
It means I create…

687
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:20,478
a value of one trillion won each year.

688
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,230
That equals 2.7 billion won a day,

689
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:24,565
100 million won an hour,

690
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,735
and 1.7 million won a minute.

691
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,030
And since I stepped into this house,

692
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,156
Ms. Nam Haeng…

693
00:41:32,239 --> 00:41:33,240
Seon.

694
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:34,950
"Seon" as in kind-hearted.

695
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,412
Ms. Nam Haeng-kind-hearted-seon,

696
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,082
you've been throwing meaningless questions
and useless jokes at me

697
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:44,418
for at least five minutes now.

698
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,629
That's 8.5 million won already.

699
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:48,756
Since this is your first time here…

700
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,425
All right.

701
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:54,261
I'll stop wasting your precious time
and disappear.

702
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,107
It's just that it might get stuffy
with the fan off.

703
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:08,567
Okay, then.

704
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,784
Let's solve some problems first.

705
00:42:17,451 --> 00:42:18,410
Mr. Choi.

706
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,205
Can I ask you something?

707
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:22,122
Sure.

708
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,332
As you just said,

709
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,210
a 30-minute class from you
should be worth 50 million won.

710
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,337
So why are you tutoring me?

711
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:30,548
My mom's lunch box costs
less than 10,000 won.

712
00:42:31,465 --> 00:42:32,925
You calculate fast.

713
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:34,593
Your skills will improve quickly.

714
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:38,556
Price and value are two different things.

715
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,809
I value your mom's cooking
as highly as my time.

716
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,937
I hope you'll make this
worth my while too.

717
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:47,273
I'm going to try my absolute best,

718
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:50,985
so you should strive for results
worth more than 50 million won.

719
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,029
Yes, sir.

720
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:55,948
Here's a test.

721
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:57,449
Solve all the problems first.

722
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,034
Okay.

723
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,042
Are you finished?

724
00:43:07,918 --> 00:43:09,461
Your dinner is almost ready.

725
00:43:09,545 --> 00:43:11,589
Hae-e, order some chicken.
It's Chicken Day.

726
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,632
-Jae-woo's busy picking out a movie.
-Okay.

727
00:43:15,050 --> 00:43:16,176
What's Chicken Day?

728
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:20,264
Once a week, we order chicken
and watch a movie my uncle likes.

729
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:21,640
It's his favorite day.

730
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,439
Mr. Choi.

731
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:32,109
Do you think Hae-e will do well--

732
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,486
Of course. She's a bright kid.

733
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:37,323
That's a relief.
This is such a special opportunity.

734
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,492
By the way,
it must've been hard for you yesterday.

735
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:42,870
Even I got upset.

736
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:45,289
Both the kids and the teachers
have emotions.

737
00:43:45,372 --> 00:43:47,082
How can they force you to teach?

738
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,376
The moms are just ridiculous.

739
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,545
-So is the academy--
-Listen, Ms. Nam Haeng…

740
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:54,548
Seon.

741
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,549
…Seon.

742
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,094
I can take care of my emotions,
so you don't have to worry.

743
00:44:00,929 --> 00:44:03,140
And while we're on the subject,

744
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:06,477
I find you just as hard to understand
as those moms.

745
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:09,605
How can you be so naive?

746
00:44:09,688 --> 00:44:11,982
A high school senior having Chicken Day?

747
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,985
She'll never catch up
with the kids ahead of her.

748
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:19,615
To reap the full benefits of my tutoring,
you'll need a reality check first.

749
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:20,741
Also…

750
00:44:22,117 --> 00:44:24,536
Just because I formed
a strategic partnership with you

751
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,664
doesn't mean we're best friends.

752
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,249
I find it detestable
when people cross my boundaries.

753
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,542
Goodbye then.

754
00:44:39,259 --> 00:44:41,428
Why does he have to be so mean?

755
00:44:41,512 --> 00:44:44,098
He keeps cutting me off
and calling me by the wrong name.

756
00:44:44,598 --> 00:44:46,892
Had it not been for the tutoring…

757
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,146
Mom, I ordered honey and fried.

758
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:52,481
Okay.

759
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:54,733
Come here, Haeng-seon. Let's get started.

760
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,152
We're watching the documentary,
The Lives of Lions.

761
00:44:57,236 --> 00:44:59,947
Again? We've watched that
at least five times.

762
00:45:01,323 --> 00:45:02,324
Goodness.

763
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,160
She walks on the grass
as quietly as she can

764
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,663
-Hae-e.
-toward her target.

765
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:11,166
Does Chicken Day
get in the way of your studies?

766
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,752
No. If it did, I'd stop doing it.

767
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:15,504
It's good for stress relief.

768
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,839
-Right?
-Yes.

769
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:17,798
I knew it.

770
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,883
What does he know? Damn it.

771
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:23,220
Her target starts fleeing from her.

772
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,146
Gosh.

773
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,316
This is so good.

774
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:41,655
She might be naive,
but she sure knows how to cook.

775
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,241
This is skill exchange at its best.

776
00:45:52,624 --> 00:45:53,917
STUDYHARD.COM

777
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,377
CHIYEOLSUCKS:
TODAY'S CLASS WAS OVER THE TOP

778
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,712
This jerk's at it again.

779
00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:00,340
I swear you pay more attention
to my classes than anyone else.

780
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:03,635
"Report."

781
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:13,228
This is B2's son, Kalua.

782
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:17,900
He recently drove out his father
and became the new dominant tiger.

783
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:24,072
But B2 awaits another opportunity.

784
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:40,214
-Hello.
-Would you like to order?

785
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,215
No.

786
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,800
Well…

787
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,763
Is Ms. Kwon Jin-gyeong in?

788
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:52,226
She usually works here
between 8 a.m. and noon.

789
00:46:52,935 --> 00:46:56,230
I heard that she works in the evening now.

790
00:46:57,689 --> 00:46:58,649
I see.

791
00:46:59,816 --> 00:47:02,361
I want waffles prepared by her.

792
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,116
Can you tell me
what time she starts working?

793
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:11,745
I need to deliver this
before Yeong-ju arrives.

794
00:47:12,246 --> 00:47:13,789
Why isn't Jae-woo back yet?

795
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:16,124
I told him to order the waffles
to go today.

796
00:47:17,251 --> 00:47:18,877
-What's that lunch box?
-Gosh!

797
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,296
Goodness, you scared me.

798
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,799
Why are you so early?
What about Miracle Morning Club?

799
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:28,303
Don't get me started.
Miracle Morning, my foot.

800
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:30,722
Miserable Morning is more like it.

801
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,891
I give up. I just can't keep up.

802
00:47:33,642 --> 00:47:35,102
So why are you packing lunch?

803
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:36,895
Going on a picnic?

804
00:47:37,646 --> 00:47:38,647
Well…

805
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,482
This is…

806
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:42,276
for Jae-woo.

807
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,194
-Jae-woo?
-Yes.

808
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:49,241
He's been pestering me to pack him a lunch
so he can go on a picnic.

809
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,909
So demanding, isn't he?

810
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:52,953
He's my enemy, not my brother.

811
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:55,080
His latest obsession must be picnics.

812
00:47:56,790 --> 00:47:57,624
Haeng-seon.

813
00:47:57,708 --> 00:48:00,460
Ms. Kwon's schedule changed,
so I couldn't get any waffles.

814
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,461
Hi, Yeong-ju.

815
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,922
Jae-woo, I finished packing your lunch.

816
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,174
-My lunch?
-Yes. Let's go.

817
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,928
-Why did you do that?
-You wanted to go on a picnic.

818
00:48:10,012 --> 00:48:10,929
Let's go.

819
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:13,932
Yeong-ju, I have to go back to the market.
I forgot the radishes.

820
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:15,559
-Okay.
-Let's go.

821
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,768
Here, your lunch.

822
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:26,028
What's this then?

823
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,196
A cabbage?

824
00:48:45,297 --> 00:48:46,548
This place is huge.

825
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,842
He must really be filthy rich.

826
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:56,350
I guess he scarfed down everything.

827
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,020
What an unlikable jerk.

828
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:03,732
Is he still asleep?

829
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:07,611
Oh, crap!

830
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:21,625
Oh, yes.

831
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:27,547
I know it was you. Look me in the eye.

832
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,466
It wasn't me, I swear.

833
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:30,717
Are you serious?

834
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,803
It says it was you right here.

835
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:34,763
-Be honest--
-What's wrong? What happened?

836
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:37,349
Mr. Choi, the thing is…

837
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:40,560
It seems like All Care tests have leaked.

838
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,270
It wasn't me.

839
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,605
This is driving me nuts.

840
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,898
Then explain.

841
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:48,402
It says here that you printed them out
yesterday morning.

842
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:50,570
Why did you print out a test
that was already covered?

843
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:53,073
I don't know. This is frustrating.

844
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,157
Oops.

845
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:56,118
I didn't think about that.

846
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,871
Let me check the entrance CCTV
to see who's been here.

847
00:49:59,955 --> 00:50:02,040
Yes, please do that.

848
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:05,460
I can't keep working here
after being framed as a thief.

849
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:06,503
Hold on.

850
00:50:10,632 --> 00:50:13,927
CCTV FOOTAGE COPIES

851
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:20,726
Is this really necessary?

852
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,646
She's our family.

853
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:26,815
Can we have a word?

854
00:50:34,281 --> 00:50:35,657
-Unbelievable.
-My gosh.

855
00:50:36,950 --> 00:50:37,826
He's so cool.

856
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:45,625
Let it slide.
They were already covered anyway.

857
00:50:45,709 --> 00:50:48,879
Still, I thought you were sensitive
about your materials leaking.

858
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:50,547
I totally am!

859
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:54,509
But some things are
more important than security.

860
00:50:55,802 --> 00:50:57,137
If you ask me,

861
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,847
our teamwork comes first, Dong-hui.

862
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:04,019
So what if a few questions leaked?

863
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,855
It's not nearly as important
as trust and teamwork.

864
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:09,357
-Seeing how frustrated Hyo-jin is--
-It's Hyo-won.

865
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:10,650
Yes, Hyo-won.

866
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:15,489
Maybe the printer malfunctioned.

867
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:18,116
Machines are not as perfect as we think.

868
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,035
They're bound to malfunction at times.

869
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,999
My point is…

870
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,460
Hey.

871
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:29,544
One of us…

872
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,839
At least one of us needs to be flexible.

873
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,425
Think about how suffocated
those kids must feel.

874
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,802
I'm extremely strict,

875
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,762
and you're no more easygoing than I am.

876
00:51:39,554 --> 00:51:40,931
Cut them some slack.

877
00:51:41,014 --> 00:51:43,141
Give those kids a break, Dong-hui.

878
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:47,813
Fine, I understand.

879
00:51:48,438 --> 00:51:50,649
-I'll let this one slide then.
-Let's do that.

880
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,985
Take them out to dinner later.

881
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,071
What was her name?

882
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,572
Hyo-jin.

883
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:59,115
Make sure she feels better.

884
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,577
Be generous.
Spend at least one million won.

885
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,705
Come with us.
We haven't had dinner together in a while.

886
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:06,957
Me?

887
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:08,500
I'm…

888
00:52:09,334 --> 00:52:10,836
feeling unwell today.

889
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:13,588
You are?

890
00:52:13,672 --> 00:52:15,841
My head feels heavy.
I'll go home and rest.

891
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,846
It's your chance to bond with the kids
while bad-mouthing me.

892
00:52:20,929 --> 00:52:22,013
Okay?

893
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:25,475
But please don't curse me out.

894
00:52:27,727 --> 00:52:28,687
Okay.

895
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,068
Gosh, my head.

896
00:52:40,448 --> 00:52:43,827
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

897
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,068
Welcome…

898
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:22,908
Hello, Ms. Kwon Jin-gyeong.

899
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,492
Hi, it's you again.

900
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:27,078
Yes. One waffle with whipped cream
and chocolate syrup

901
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:28,580
plus a decaf iced Americano.

902
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:32,918
My sister doesn't allow me
to drink coffee at night,

903
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:34,377
but decaf is fine.

904
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,089
Sure.

905
00:53:40,759 --> 00:53:42,802
One decaf iced Americano, please.

906
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:43,929
That's right.

907
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:57,984
Here's your Americano.

908
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,027
Thank you.

909
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:04,240
-Your waffle is ready.
-Thank you.

910
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,285
I'm sorry, Ms. Kwon Jin-gyeong.

911
00:54:07,369 --> 00:54:09,037
What are you doing?

912
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,331
I'm sorry.
You had chocolate syrup on your--

913
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,166
Who are you? Stop fooling around.

914
00:54:13,917 --> 00:54:16,252
I'm not. She had chocolate syrup on her--

915
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:18,338
Shut up. You're a stalker, aren't you?

916
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:21,466
You look for my girlfriend
and order the same thing every day.

917
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:24,511
Who the hell are you?
The hell is your deal?

918
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,305
I'm Nam Jae-woo
from Nation's Best Banchan. That hurts.

919
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,015
-You little…
-It hurts.

920
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,976
-Stop it.
-You're hurting me!

921
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:34,229
Jun-u, are you okay?

922
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:46,908
Mark any difficult problems
on the worksheet.

923
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,326
-Okay.
-Thank you for today.

924
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,411
Here's your dinner.

925
00:54:51,997 --> 00:54:53,248
What are you doing?

926
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,250
I'm trying not to cross your boundaries.

927
00:54:55,333 --> 00:54:57,419
Hang it on the doorknob
when you're finished.

928
00:54:57,502 --> 00:54:59,462
I have to reuse the containers.

929
00:54:59,546 --> 00:55:00,672
Gosh, my back.

930
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,599
Thank you.

931
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,187
Get home safe.

932
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:17,355
-Goodbye.
-Hello?

933
00:55:17,439 --> 00:55:18,940
Is this Mr. Nam Jae-woo's sister?

934
00:55:19,024 --> 00:55:20,442
Yes, that's me.

935
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,736
-This is the police.
-Pardon?

936
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,155
The police?

937
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:36,583
Mom, I'll come with you.

938
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,959
No, stay home.

939
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,210
I'll call you.

940
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:44,090
Come on. Not now.

941
00:55:44,966 --> 00:55:46,426
This is driving me crazy.

942
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:33,848
KIND AND TRUSTWORTHY GANGHYEON POLICE

943
00:56:33,932 --> 00:56:35,767
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

944
00:56:42,607 --> 00:56:43,566
Hold on.

945
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:46,069
Wait! This!

946
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:53,076
There.

947
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:54,369
Jae-woo.

948
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,121
Jae-woo, come here.

949
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,997
-Haeng-seon.
-Yes, come here.

950
00:56:58,081 --> 00:57:00,583
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

951
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,085
Let me see.

952
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,756
Hang in there.
I'll get you out in no time.

953
00:57:09,717 --> 00:57:11,136
Your hands…

954
00:57:11,845 --> 00:57:12,929
I'll be right back.

955
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:16,516
Please.

956
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:30,864
UPSTANDING AND HONEST POLICE

957
00:57:35,118 --> 00:57:36,453
I'm sorry.

958
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,538
I'm so sorry.

959
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,665
You must have been startled.

960
00:57:41,332 --> 00:57:45,170
I should've kept a closer eye on him,
but I was too busy working.

961
00:57:48,089 --> 00:57:49,090
The thing is,

962
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:51,759
my brother…

963
00:57:52,677 --> 00:57:56,306
has Asperger's. He's on the spectrum.

964
00:57:57,223 --> 00:58:00,602
His symptoms differ
from the typical symptoms of autism.

965
00:58:01,186 --> 00:58:03,563
He can manage daily activities
with no problem,

966
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:05,648
but he struggles with social interactions.

967
00:58:06,357 --> 00:58:10,153
He tends to lack awareness
of other people's emotions.

968
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,407
At times, he becomes
completely obsessed with certain things.

969
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:18,244
Jae-woo loves the waffles you make,
Ms. Kwon.

970
00:58:20,205 --> 00:58:22,165
His name is Jae-woo, by the way.

971
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,959
He said your waffles were
a lot crispier and tastier

972
00:58:25,043 --> 00:58:27,462
than those made by the other part-timers.

973
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:33,426
He's been visiting the cafe
to have your waffles on his morning walks.

974
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,639
It's been an important part of his routine
and a source of happiness.

975
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,475
I'm sorry.

976
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,186
You must have been scared.

977
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:47,774
You had good reason to get offended.
So did your boyfriend.

978
00:58:47,857 --> 00:58:50,735
But he meant well.

979
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:51,986
I can vouch for that.

980
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:56,032
He's been living with me
ever since our mom passed away.

981
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:59,744
I can tell what he's thinking
just by his expression or his breathing.

982
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:04,207
I'm really sorry that you got hurt.

983
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,628
I'll pay for the treatment
and the dry cleaning.

984
00:59:08,711 --> 00:59:10,296
If you could please…

985
00:59:11,339 --> 00:59:12,924
drop the charges? I beg you.

986
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:18,221
Why let that freak go around
on his own in the first place?

987
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,389
What a nuisance.

988
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:23,434
Yes, you have every right to say that.

989
00:59:23,518 --> 00:59:26,688
It's all my and my brother's fault.

990
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,608
Forget it. We can't let this slide.

991
00:59:30,692 --> 00:59:31,734
I'll drop it.

992
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:34,445
I'll drop the charges.

993
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,407
On one condition.

994
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,578
I don't want him to come back
to the cafe again.

995
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,246
I was too startled.

996
00:59:43,329 --> 00:59:46,583
Of course. Thank you so much.

997
00:59:46,666 --> 00:59:48,042
You're so kind.

998
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:51,504
Thank you so much.

999
00:59:53,673 --> 00:59:54,716
Thank you.

1000
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:57,427
Thank you.

1001
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,559
Are you okay, Jae-woo?

1002
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:07,145
I'm hungry.

1003
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,939
Goodness. In this situation?

1004
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:12,442
You'll be the death of me.

1005
01:00:12,525 --> 01:00:14,902
Stop causing trouble, will you?

1006
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,992
Why is he still here?

1007
01:00:25,330 --> 01:00:26,497
You haven't left?

1008
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:30,627
I'm sorry for leaving this.
I was so flustered earlier.

1009
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:33,171
You could've given it to me tomorrow.

1010
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,757
What if you call me a thief again?

1011
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,509
Gosh, let it go already.

1012
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,262
Thank you for everything.

1013
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:43,056
Jae-woo, thank him.

1014
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,684
Goodbye, then.

1015
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:52,565
Let's go.

1016
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,416
Hello, Mr. Ji.

1017
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,252
Are you home? Are you feeling better?

1018
01:01:13,878 --> 01:01:15,546
"Feeling better"? Why…

1019
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:16,673
Right.

1020
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:19,550
Yes, much better. I'm about to go to bed.

1021
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,094
I'm sorry to bother you,

1022
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:22,553
but the print shop just called

1023
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,972
and said there was a problem
with one of the graphs.

1024
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:28,184
I can't check the file on my phone,
so could you please check it?

1025
01:01:28,267 --> 01:01:29,268
Me?

1026
01:01:31,062 --> 01:01:32,355
Well, I'm…

1027
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:35,525
Since I'm home…

1028
01:01:35,608 --> 01:01:36,484
All right.

1029
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,111
I'll do it.

1030
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,631
Okay. I just turned on my computer.

1031
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,717
-Already? That was fast.
-Of course.

1032
01:02:01,926 --> 01:02:03,010
Because I'm home.

1033
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,596
Which graph do you mean?

1034
01:02:05,680 --> 01:02:08,599
It's the function graph
on practice question number 27.

1035
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:13,479
Now that the graph has been fixed,
can we go for another drink?

1036
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:15,273
How about some wine?

1037
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,191
Sounds good.

1038
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,694
We can only have fancy drinks
when Mr. Choi is paying.

1039
01:02:19,777 --> 01:02:20,611
Exactly.

1040
01:02:20,695 --> 01:02:23,573
It's your lucky day.

1041
01:02:23,656 --> 01:02:27,452
Fine. I'll let Hyo-won have her way
since I mistreated her today.

1042
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:29,036
Let's go to the wine bar.

1043
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:32,248
-Let's go.
-Ji Dong-hui!

1044
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:34,125
-Ji Dong-hui!
-Ji Dong-hui!

1045
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:36,169
We're going to a wine bar!

1046
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,254
I have a wine bar
I've been wanting to go to.

1047
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:39,172
Let's go there.

1048
01:02:50,057 --> 01:02:52,685
I've been doing
a lot of legwork this week.

1049
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:53,811
So?

1050
01:02:53,895 --> 01:02:55,146
Did you look into things?

1051
01:02:55,229 --> 01:02:56,522
Find anything interesting?

1052
01:02:57,231 --> 01:02:59,901
A few things, but they're all trivial.

1053
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,152
Come on.

1054
01:03:01,235 --> 01:03:03,571
Haven't we blown up trivial things before?

1055
01:03:04,197 --> 01:03:06,324
Just find any dirt on him.

1056
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:09,202
I, Chiyeolsucks,
will come up with a juicy story.

1057
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:14,123
I might be onto something huge.

1058
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:16,334
Something huge? What is it?

1059
01:03:16,417 --> 01:03:17,752
Was it ten years ago?

1060
01:03:17,835 --> 01:03:21,088
Chi-yeol was Math King's
teaching assistant back then.

1061
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:24,175
I heard that. It was at Tenten Academy,
which no longer exists.

1062
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,510
That's right.

1063
01:03:25,593 --> 01:03:28,262
Back then, Chi-yeol was
quite close with a female student

1064
01:03:28,346 --> 01:03:30,431
who eventually jumped to her death.

1065
01:03:30,515 --> 01:03:32,975
Although it was
right after Chi-yeol got fired

1066
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:34,977
for some unknown reason

1067
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,939
by Math King, who used to have
a soft spot for him.

1068
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:41,943
-So?
-He clashed with Lee Young-min too.

1069
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:44,821
Connect the two and there you have it.

1070
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,329
You're not leaving?

1071
01:03:53,412 --> 01:03:55,164
I have to finish writing up a report.

1072
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:58,584
You need some downtime
while things are slow.

1073
01:03:58,668 --> 01:04:00,461
-Finish up and go home.
-Yes, sir.

1074
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:01,921
-Goodbye!
-See you.

1075
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,763
He had ramyeon,

1076
01:04:11,764 --> 01:04:12,849
came out, and…

1077
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,977
He went for a smoke.

1078
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:20,273
As a teenager,
he had to hide in the corner.

1079
01:04:23,067 --> 01:04:25,903
But this is a blind spot.

1080
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:28,656
Hold on.

1081
01:04:29,866 --> 01:04:30,950
What's that?

1082
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:32,535
I just saw something shiny.

1083
01:04:36,163 --> 01:04:37,248
What's this?

1084
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:45,131
Uncle Jae-woo, are you okay?

1085
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:46,299
Are you hurt?

1086
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,425
I'm fine.

1087
01:04:48,301 --> 01:04:50,386
I'm sorry I made you worry, Hae-e.

1088
01:04:50,469 --> 01:04:54,098
Hae-e, see if there's any tofu
in the fridge.

1089
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,892
-For Uncle Jae-woo.
-Okay.

1090
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:56,976
Have a seat.

1091
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:03,316
There's no tofu, Mom.

1092
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,109
Will beans work too?

1093
01:05:05,192 --> 01:05:07,194
-Give it here.
-Here.

1094
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:09,113
Eat some.

1095
01:05:09,196 --> 01:05:11,198
This is what you eat
after being behind bars.

1096
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:13,993
I don't like beans.

1097
01:05:14,076 --> 01:05:15,286
Eat up.

1098
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:29,216
Haeng-seon.

1099
01:05:30,843 --> 01:05:33,679
I'm not allowed to go eat
Ms. Kwon's waffles anymore, right?

1100
01:05:35,973 --> 01:05:37,934
But her waffles are delicious.

1101
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:41,062
And I'm not a stalker.

1102
01:05:44,982 --> 01:05:45,858
Right.

1103
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,527
There are a lot of nice waffle makers
on the market these days.

1104
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:49,612
We could buy one.

1105
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:51,906
Order it right away. I'll pay you later.

1106
01:05:51,989 --> 01:05:52,865
Okay.

1107
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,411
Should we go camping this Saturday?

1108
01:05:57,495 --> 01:05:58,579
That's a good idea.

1109
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:00,289
Uncle Jae-woo loves camping.

1110
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:02,458
We'll watch the campfire
and roast potatoes.

1111
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:04,877
-Can we roast marshmallows too?
-Yes.

1112
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,462
Sounds awesome.

1113
01:06:06,545 --> 01:06:08,172
Sure. Let's roast everything.

1114
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:11,467
Great. Then we should get
camping equipment and a waffle maker.

1115
01:06:11,550 --> 01:06:12,802
Hae-e, show me.

1116
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,512
Okay.

1117
01:06:24,271 --> 01:06:27,358
You guys continue.
I'll go get some tofu for your uncle.

1118
01:06:27,441 --> 01:06:28,651
Be careful.

1119
01:06:40,454 --> 01:06:41,414
Hey, Hae-e.

1120
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:44,041
Uncle Jae-woo is fast asleep.

1121
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,668
You don't have to get any tofu.

1122
01:06:48,754 --> 01:06:49,672
Okay.

1123
01:07:07,023 --> 01:07:09,692
Why is she drinking alone
in the middle of the night?

1124
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:11,652
Nam Jae-woo.

1125
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:14,613
I'll eat all the tofu for you.

1126
01:07:15,656 --> 01:07:16,490
Wait.

1127
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:26,542
She can take care of herself.

1128
01:07:27,626 --> 01:07:29,086
She's been on the national team.

1129
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,327
-What--
-Stop drinking.

1130
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,162
You've already drunk a lot.

1131
01:08:04,371 --> 01:08:06,332
You…

1132
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:10,169
I mean…

1133
01:08:11,253 --> 01:08:13,464
You came out of nowhere.

1134
01:08:15,591 --> 01:08:16,967
Were you waiting for me again?

1135
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:18,552
Don't be absurd.

1136
01:08:18,636 --> 01:08:19,887
Stand up. It's late.

1137
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,388
I can't.

1138
01:08:21,472 --> 01:08:23,599
I just poured this.

1139
01:08:25,726 --> 01:08:28,062
This one is expensive.

1140
01:08:28,938 --> 01:08:31,482
It was a big decision for me.

1141
01:08:33,526 --> 01:08:37,363
Sure, it must be chump change to you.

1142
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:40,366
Because you're the Trillion Won Man!

1143
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,826
Keep it down.

1144
01:08:41,909 --> 01:08:45,371
-Million Won Man? Billion Won Man?
-Gosh.

1145
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,497
No.

1146
01:08:46,580 --> 01:08:49,834
-You're a goddamn Trillion Won Man.
-Come on.

1147
01:08:49,917 --> 01:08:52,169
You must be so damn happy.

1148
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:53,587
-That's enough.
-Right?

1149
01:08:53,671 --> 01:08:55,005
-You should stop.
-A goddamn--

1150
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:56,423
Cut it out.

1151
01:08:56,507 --> 01:08:58,425
-You're a lucky bastard!
-Stop it.

1152
01:08:58,509 --> 01:09:00,594
Lower your voice, for God's sake.

1153
01:09:00,678 --> 01:09:02,346
-Come on.
-Hey!

1154
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:05,808
Question number 22 was on nth roots,
and it was quite difficult.

1155
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,561
-Good grief.
-It might have made you panic,

1156
01:09:08,644 --> 01:09:10,729
-but there's no need. Why?
-Mister!

1157
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,189
Because you took Choi Chi-yeol's course.

1158
01:09:12,273 --> 01:09:14,525
Stop staring at your phone
and keep me company.

1159
01:09:16,443 --> 01:09:19,989
Where are your manners?

1160
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:23,033
You keep cutting me off

1161
01:09:23,117 --> 01:09:24,952
and calling me

1162
01:09:25,911 --> 01:09:27,538
by the wrong name!

1163
01:09:27,621 --> 01:09:28,914
Look.

1164
01:09:28,998 --> 01:09:32,126
I'm mustering up every ounce of manners
I have in my body

1165
01:09:32,209 --> 01:09:33,627
to be sitting here in the first place!

1166
01:09:33,711 --> 01:09:34,879
Whatever.

1167
01:09:36,505 --> 01:09:38,382
If you're going to stay, drink with me.

1168
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:41,719
Or just leave. You're spoiling my fun.

1169
01:09:49,143 --> 01:09:51,145
Will you leave once you empty that bottle?

1170
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:54,023
Yes.

1171
01:09:54,857 --> 01:09:55,816
I will.

1172
01:09:56,609 --> 01:09:58,694
Fine. Then let's get to it.

1173
01:09:58,777 --> 01:10:00,529
Let's empty the bottle and leave.

1174
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:01,530
Here.

1175
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:19,548
You're drinking for real?

1176
01:10:20,090 --> 01:10:22,551
-Drink up. Hurry.
-My goodness.

1177
01:10:25,512 --> 01:10:26,639
Drink up.

1178
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,021
-I knew it.
-Give it here.

1179
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:37,524
Drinking is more fun if you have company.

1180
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:39,193
Hurry up.

1181
01:10:39,276 --> 01:10:40,527
Pour all of it.

1182
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,830
How strong is this anyway?

1183
01:10:52,414 --> 01:10:54,041
Why is my chest burning?

1184
01:10:56,126 --> 01:10:57,795
It's 56 percent alcohol.

1185
01:10:57,878 --> 01:10:59,713
One more bottle.

1186
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:01,674
-I knew it.
-One more bottle.

1187
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:06,053
One more bottle.

1188
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:08,138
One more…

1189
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:15,062
Mr. Choi.

1190
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:21,610
Mr. Choi!

1191
01:11:22,736 --> 01:11:24,530
My gosh.

1192
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:29,076
If you can't handle alcohol,
you shouldn't have drunk.

1193
01:11:29,159 --> 01:11:31,036
You sobered me up.

1194
01:11:34,081 --> 01:11:35,207
You're heavy.

1195
01:11:36,709 --> 01:11:37,668
Gosh!

1196
01:11:40,963 --> 01:11:42,006
It's cold.

1197
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:47,928
Mr. Choi.

1198
01:11:51,849 --> 01:11:52,808
It's cold.

1199
01:11:55,269 --> 01:11:56,312
What do I do?

1200
01:12:02,943 --> 01:12:04,236
Aren't you late for school?

1201
01:12:05,237 --> 01:12:06,864
I have to open up the shop soon.

1202
01:12:20,294 --> 01:12:22,588
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Mr. Choi.

1203
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:26,800
How does bean sprout pollock soup
sound for breakfast?

1204
01:12:41,815 --> 01:12:43,567
Your delicious rice is ready.

1205
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,289
Isn't this Mr. Choi's car?

1206
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:09,551
Your pants were wet,
and I was worried you'd catch a cold.

1207
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:12,471
Don't worry. Jae-woo changed your clothes.

1208
01:13:12,554 --> 01:13:15,182
Hae-e and I didn't see anything,
nor did we want to.

1209
01:13:18,727 --> 01:13:21,105
Since you're here anyway,
have breakfast with us.

1210
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,023
No.

1211
01:13:23,107 --> 01:13:23,982
I'm good.

1212
01:13:25,359 --> 01:13:26,485
By any chance…

1213
01:13:27,486 --> 01:13:29,196
did you take photos of me passed out…

1214
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:30,697
Oh, my. Of course not.

1215
01:13:30,781 --> 01:13:32,741
What do you take me for?

1216
01:13:33,325 --> 01:13:34,326
Gosh.

1217
01:13:41,166 --> 01:13:43,419
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye, Mr. Choi.

1218
01:13:43,502 --> 01:13:45,170
He should've had breakfast before…

1219
01:13:46,171 --> 01:13:47,756
Mr. Choi!

1220
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:49,049
His belt.

1221
01:13:49,133 --> 01:13:50,342
Mr. Choi!

1222
01:13:51,176 --> 01:13:52,052
Jeez.

1223
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:54,304
Mr. Choi!

1224
01:13:54,388 --> 01:13:56,140
-You forgot your belt.
-Hold on.

1225
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:58,100
-Here--
-My belt.

1226
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,145
Give me my belt.

1227
01:14:06,733 --> 01:14:11,905
NATION'S BEST BANCHAN

1228
01:14:52,613 --> 01:14:54,615
CRASH COURSE IN ROMANCE

1229
01:14:54,698 --> 01:14:57,701
Why did he come out of your place
in the morning scantily dressed?

1230
01:14:57,784 --> 01:14:59,578
I don't think this is right.

1231
01:14:59,661 --> 01:15:01,163
Strictly speaking, it's not even tutoring.

1232
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:03,540
I think you need to see this one.

1233
01:15:04,041 --> 01:15:07,127
Choi Chi-yeol
basically annihilated a family.

1234
01:15:07,920 --> 01:15:10,130
-I'm done, Mr. Choi.
- What?

1235
01:15:10,214 --> 01:15:11,507
Why does Hae-e have this?

1236
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:14,927
I think Sun-jae is leaking
All Care materials to Hae-e.

1237
01:15:15,010 --> 01:15:17,137
How can he leak those materials?

1238
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:20,349
Why I was able to only stomach her food…

1239
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:21,892
Why I was drawn to her…

1240
01:15:21,975 --> 01:15:23,477
Now I understand.

1241
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:33,445
