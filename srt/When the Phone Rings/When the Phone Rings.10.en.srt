Hee-joo.

4
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:04,272
Did you sleep well?

5
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,356
Yeah.

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,527
I want to sleep more.

7
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,239
Go back to sleep.

8
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,494
- But you'll be late for work.
- What?

9
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,080
What time is it?

10
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:21,998
- Right now?
- Yeah.

11
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:23,875
It's Saturday.

12
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:25,835
I can't believe you!

13
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,296
Get up.

14
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:29,964
Don't.

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,091
- Get up.
- Don't!

16
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,384
<i>I had a dream.</i>

17
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,678
The toothpaste!

18
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,598
Squeeze it from the bottom
and not the middle!

19
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,767
How many times have I told you?

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,813
Who takes off their clothes
inside out like this?

21
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:46,856
What about you?

22
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:49,317
You always do that with your socks.

23
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,401
When did I do that?

24
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,695
All the time.
So when I put it in the basket,

25
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,073
- I do this.
- When? Tell me the exact time.

26
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,908
- So childish.
- I am not.

27
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,327
<i>In the dream,</i>

28
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,831
<i>we were ordinary just like everyone else.</i>

29
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,629
<i>The peaceful happiness</i>
<i>everyone gets to enjoy in life.</i>

30
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,300
<i>Why was that so hard for us?</i>

31
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,887
<i>We just…</i>

32
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:22,392
<i>wanted to love and rely on each other,</i>

33
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:26,271
<i>cherish each other,</i>

34
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:29,732

What the hell?

40
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:19,407
Where is he?

41
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,624
PAIK SA-EON'S COMING TOO,
LET'S PLAY TOGETHER.

42
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,484
I thought he wanted to play.

43
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:57,028
Where did he go?

44
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:06,746
Is it you?

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,583
Are you "Master"?

<i>What do you think?</i>

00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,327
<i>Don't act alone from now on.</i>

51
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,373
<i>So why did you leave me out?</i>

52
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:52,375
<i>I want to join in on the fun too.</i>

53
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,296
<i>I'll give you a job.</i>

54
00:04:57,255 --> 00:05:00,425
<i>Make sure she doesn't back out.</i>

Where's Hong Hee-joo?

57
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,821
So why did you lie?

58
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,282
You're the one who lied!

59
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:31,789
Sir?

60
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,541
A call came in a moment ago.

61
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,542
This…

00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,588
Going somewhere?

65
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,261
Why?

66
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:31,557
Did you do something that made you want
to run away from me?

67
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,519
- Stop.
- What do you mean?

68
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,021
I know you're the one behind it all.

69
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,149
Leave him alone.

70
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,234
Right.

71
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,404
You must've seen my face

72
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:47,406
on the news.

73
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,076
So what?

74
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:57,792
Did you tell that bastard?

75
00:06:58,501 --> 00:06:59,335
That kid…

76
00:07:00,837 --> 00:07:02,171
did nothing wrong.

77
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,967
It was your grandfather and parents
who tried to kill you.

78
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,429
Why are you trying to take revenge
on the wrong person?

79
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,186
What do you mean, he did nothing wrong?

80
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,941
He's enjoyed my life for decades.

81
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,945
He got to live under my name!

82
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,322
I never should've let you live.

83
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:31,117
When Paik Jang-ho tried to kill you,

84
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,828
I should've let him.

85
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:37,790
There's no point in regretting it now.

86
00:07:38,374 --> 00:07:39,625
It's too late.

87
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,794
Don't get in the way.

88
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,130
Don't take his side either.

89
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,383
I'm going to…

90
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,594
destroy him.

91
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:59,061
You're the real Paik Sa-eon.

92
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,439
You caught me.

93
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,444
Is that why you used Hong Hee-joo as bait

94
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,529
to lure me in?

95
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,990
Did you call Paik Sa-eon too?

96
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,826
The three of us should meet
and talk face-to-face.

97
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,744
Yeah.

98
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,121
I'll give you your chance,

99
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,789
so shut up and wait.

100
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,640
I don't need you anymore.

101
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,974
Goodbye.

Were you one of Paik Sa-eon's lackeys?

Park Do-jae, wake up.

120
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,960
Wake up, Do-jae!

121
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:17,885
Where's Hee-joo?

122
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,553
What did you do with her?

123
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,390
He's here…

124
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,738
Hee-joo!

125
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:39,448
Hee-joo!

126
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:41,951
Yeah!

127
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,662
Come on.

128
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:46,497
Hee-joo!

129
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,540
Hee-joo!

00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,839
Are you up, Sis?

131
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,261
Hee-joo!

132
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,555
Stop.

133
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:03,764
I don't want to.

134
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,517
Stop the car, asshole!

135
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:15,943
Hee-joo!

136
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:19,822
Are you okay?

137
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,199
- Were you hurt?
- I'm fine.

138
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,378
Are you okay?

139
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,891
Is it you?

140
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:49,018
Are you him?

141
00:12:49,101 --> 00:12:50,269
You look…

142
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,688
great.

143
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:56,859
For someone who used to fish
with your bare hands here.

144
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,069
So, what is it that you want?

145
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,197
Your name? Your place?

146
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,865
Do you want them back?

147
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,117
Really?

148
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,035
Yeah!

149
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,496
Take them all back!

150
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:12,124
I never wanted them in the first place.

151
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,710
Just take them all back!

152
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:17,254
Really?

153
00:13:18,255 --> 00:13:19,840
Will you give me Hong Hee-joo too?

154
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:22,051
Well?

155
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:26,680
Will Hong Hee-joo be my wife now?

156
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:16,355
Park Do-jae!

157
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,030
How touching.

158
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,699
It really is.

159
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:32,955
Get him.

160
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,873
Go after him.

161
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,624
Don't talk.

162
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:36,667
I called an ambulance.

163
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:41,297
It's true.

164
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,550
I intentionally stayed

165
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,302
by your side.

166
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:48,095
Because…

167
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,432
I believed you were Paik Sa-eon,

168
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,602
who killed my brother.

169
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,274
<i>I can give her everything.</i>

170
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:04,612
<i>If that's what Hee-joo wants,</i>
<i>I'll give as much as she needs.</i>

171
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:06,947
<i>Then promise me.</i>

172
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,824
<i>If I make an effort</i>

173
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,077
<i>and we can change,</i>

174
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:16,040
<i>promise you'll never make this call again.</i>

175
00:15:19,835 --> 00:15:20,669
On the mountain,

176
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:24,048
I was the one

177
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,008
who pushed her.

178
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:36,518
<i>Change of plan.</i>

179
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,437
<i>Today's D-Day.</i>

180
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:44,401
<i>Just like when I lost my only family,</i>

181
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,988
<i>I wanted you…</i>

182
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,994
<i>to feel the pain</i>
<i>of losing someone precious to you.</i>

183
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,873
You got it wrong.

184
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,126
It wasn't him. It was that bastard.

185
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,045
Then who on earth are you?

186
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,923
Why aren't you Paik Sa-eon?

187
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:09,176
All this time,

188
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:12,554
what the hell have I been doing?

189
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,198
Park Do-jae.

190
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,325
Park Do-jae!

191
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:34,785
Park Do-jae!

192
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:36,870
Wake up!

193
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:38,872
Park Do-jae!

194
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:52,928
<i>It's nice to meet you.</i>

195
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:56,181
I'm Park Do-jae,
and I'm the new trainee reporter.

196
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:04,440
- The Presidential Office?
- Yes, as a special administrative officer.

197
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,566
But you know,

198
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:10,237
you never know when or how
I'll be replaced as the spokesperson.

199
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,614
It doesn't matter. It's an honor.

200
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,618
I'll work hard.

201
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,122
Also, thank you so much

202
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,541
for choosing me, sir.

203
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,840
Were you hurt?

204
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,308
I entrusted everything to him.

205
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,810
On the day you were kidnapped,

206
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,856
I had him track the phone and location

207
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,817
and get you bodyguards.

208
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,153
On top of that,

209
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,074
I entrusted you to Park Do-jae myself.

210
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,659
It's not your fault.

211
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,286
Don't blame yourself.

212
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,335
Where did it all go wrong?

213
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:09,254
He's right.

214
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,928
I used to live here, catching fish.

215
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,895
All of these assholes.

216
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,901
They're all coming at me.
They must have a death wish.

217
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:36,091
His first death anniversary is coming up.
In three days, right?

218
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,552
Exactly a year ago, around this time,

219
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:42,181
when I saw the news
that Paik Jang-ho had died,

220
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:44,892
it all came back to me.

221
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,855
His face was like on every channel,
and it came back to me.

222
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:51,857
Help!

223
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:56,778
<i>The face of the man</i>
<i>who pushed me into the water.</i>

224
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,040
So,

225
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,375
do you know what I thought?

226
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,004
"What a shame."

227
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:17,257
"I should've killed that bastard myself."

228
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,344
With my hands.

229
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,763
I should've done it myself.

230
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:26,892
What?

231
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:29,436
Are my hands weird?

232
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:34,608
Are they dirty?

233
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:44,493
Are you crying?

234
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,247
Why? Do you pity me?

235
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:50,916
No.

236
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,128
I pity myself.

237
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,677
I was tricked.

238
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:04,638
I was told you died.

239
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,142
No, he said he killed you.

240
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:14,481
That old bastard tricked me.

241
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,074
What the hell are you saying?

242
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,119
You all wanted me dead and gone.

243
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:31,748
Do you know
why I didn't come after you people first?

244
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,001
Because I knew you'd kill me again.

245
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,712
You'd lock me up again!

246
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:38,213
No, no.

247
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,465
No, my baby…

248
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,842
My baby…

249
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:44,386
- I just…
- You just what? Tell me.

250
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,931
Are you happy I'm alive?
Are you happy to see me?

251
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,684
I…

252
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,022
I never…

253
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,151
want to lose you again.

254
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,156
I mean that.

255
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,162
No!

256
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:14,124
- Professor!
- Who are you?

257
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,459
Get him.

258
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,309
Get back, or else I'll kill him.

259
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,396
See you soon, old man!

260
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,649
I'll give you a show of a lifetime!

261
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,177
Did you find him?

262
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,054
No.

263
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:16,144
Honey, how could you still treat him
like this?

264
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,231
He went to hell and back!

265
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:21,233
- How could you?
- Hell?

266
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:25,779
He's making our lives
a living hell right now.

267
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,656
Snap out of it!

268
00:23:43,713 --> 00:23:46,133
Was living ever heaven on earth for you?

269
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,886
I don't know about you,

270
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:53,390
but I've never had a single day of peace.

271
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,102
Stop playing the victim.

272
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,520
What if we find him?

273
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:02,566
Can you proudly call him our son
in front of the world?

274
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,609
Can you care for him all your life?

275
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:09,739
He's…

276
00:24:11,491 --> 00:24:13,076
the monster we created.

277
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,663
He's nothing more…

278
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:20,083
and nothing less.

279
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:30,260
He takes after you a lot.

280
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,977
But do you know something?

281
00:24:41,438 --> 00:24:43,398
Neither you nor he

282
00:24:44,191 --> 00:24:46,109
takes after Paik Jang-ho.

283
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:48,236
Why are you bringing that up now?

284
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:54,576
There's someone else
who takes after Paik Jang-ho.

285
00:24:56,494 --> 00:24:57,537
What?

286
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,641
<i>There's nothing you can do about it</i>
<i>even if you find out now.</i>

287
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,436
<i>Paik Jang-ho's dead.</i>

288
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:25,941
<i>That son is rising much faster</i>
<i>than you are.</i>

289
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,318
The Paik family

290
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:31,488
values the presidential race
more than life itself,

291
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:32,989
and unless you give it up,

292
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:35,742
what can you possibly do?

293
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:13,405
Yesterday afternoon,
the Seongnang Police Station

294
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,825
announced the arrest of a suspect
believed to be an accomplice

295
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,535
in the Paik Sa-eon threat case

296
00:26:18,618 --> 00:26:21,454
and stated that his residence
had been searched.

297
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:24,791
Reporter Kim Jeong-seon
has more on the details.

298
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:28,712
<i>Police investigators are raiding</i>
<i>the suspect's residence in Seoul.</i>

299
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,839
<i>The search lasted five hours…</i>

300
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,634
Are they saying
that's where Park Do-jae lives?

301
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,469
No way.

302
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,929
What's going on?

303
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,889
Why would he do that to Mr. Paik?

304
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:41,349
Is Mr. Paik okay?

305
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,436
I spoke with him on the phone earlier.
He didn't sound okay.

306
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,147
Well, how can he be okay?

307
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:50,859
He kept him by his side
and trusted him more than anyone.

308
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,778
What happens now?

309
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,906
Mr. Park will be investigated
and punished for it.

310
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,285
And the spokesperson said
he'd clarify his position soon.

311
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:08,752
<i>We'll continue with the latest updates.</i>

312
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,005
<i>While the police were investigating</i>
<i>the motive and circumstances</i>

313
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,883
<i>of the crime with the arrested accomplice,</i>

314
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,926
<i>they identified</i>
<i>two of the criminal's hideouts</i>

315
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,678
<i>and conducted a focused search.</i>

316
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:22,974
<i>During this process, a weapon believed</i>
<i>to have been used in the crime was found…</i>

317
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:25,727
- He won't pick up.
<i>- …thoroughly investigated.</i>

318
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,730
<i>Based on the unidentifiable fingerprints…</i>

319
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:29,731
PAIK SA-EON

320
00:27:29,856 --> 00:27:34,736
<i>…the suspect is likely an unregistered</i>
<i>person with no official family ties.</i>

321
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,198
FATHER

322
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,955
We're analyzing the computer hardware
obtained from Park Do-jae's residence,

323
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:49,042
and it appears to have been used
for backdoor hacking.

324
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,170
Is that how he wiretapped me
and tracked my location?

325
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:56,883
Yes, but there was another target
of the hacking besides you,

326
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,260
and we suspect it was his accomplice.

327
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,346
The one who made the threats?

328
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,266
So, doesn't that mean
we can track his location right now?

329
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,145
The problem is
that the program is encrypted.

330
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,566
We don't know
how long it'll take to decrypt it.

331
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,529
Then to ask Park Do-jae for it

332
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,864
would be the fastest way.

333
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:22,867
Yes, but he's exercising
his right to remain silent.

334
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:26,579
And as I told you, this morning…

335
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,874
How is he?

336
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:32,836
Fortunately, it's not life-threatening.

337
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,800
PARK * JAE

338
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,278
Serves you right.

339
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,196
You're unbelievable.

340
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,491
But then,

341
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,119
it's understandable.

342
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,122
Turns out you were helping
the culprit all this time,

343
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,040
and he made a fool of you.

344
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:12,959
You feel empty and embarrassed.

345
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,837
I bet you wanted to disappear.

346
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,716
You got me wrong and sought revenge
because you were deceived.

347
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,220
But you tried to hurt Hee-joo too.
That's a different issue.

348
00:29:24,888 --> 00:29:27,015
That's attempted murder. You know that?

349
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,100
You have no right to blame me.

350
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,520
You've had a good life
living as Paik Sa-eon.

351
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,105
- Am I wrong?
- You're right.

352
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:38,401
I'll make sure everyone,
including me, pays for their sins.

353
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:41,321
So help me catch him first.

354
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,574
Don't be ridiculous.

355
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:47,243
You will expose the Paik family's secrets

356
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:49,204
and give up the highest power
in the country?

357
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,789
I won't fall for it.

358
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:52,499
I won't be fooled twice.

359
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:54,292
Then why did you save me?

360
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,545
Have you ever thought

361
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:01,925
that I might not be the person you hate,

362
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:04,427
even just once?

363
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,025
I have no intention of showing mercy.

364
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,153
If you want a lighter sentence,
cooperate with the police.

365
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:26,699
Have you…

366
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,079
never doubted me?

367
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,291
Thinking you might have seen
through my true intentions,

368
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:38,002
I was always on edge.

369
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:39,963
Because you…

370
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,300
could've seen right through me.

371
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,017
I trusted you.

372
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:57,188
I don't trust anyone.

373
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,984
But I trusted you.

374
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:17,166
I know it's late,

375
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,670
but would you…

376
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,798
consider trusting me now?

377
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,238
YUN HYEON-SEONG

378
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,158
So,

379
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,994
Mr. Jeong Jin-seok raised Sa-eon,

380
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:56,831
and the real son, thought to be dead,
has returned and is trying to kill Sa-eon.

381
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,790
And that ass…

382
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,842
And that bad guy
is the boy from the villa?

383
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,845
You're good at summarizing.

384
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,848
You should be hearing it
from the person involved,

385
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,642
but I know you would've found out anyway.

386
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,687
You can hear the rest from him.

387
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:22,857
"The rest"?

388
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:25,902
Is there more?

389
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,493
Poor Sa-eon.

390
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:36,120
It must've been so hard
and lonely for him.

391
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,917
Carrying all of those secrets alone.

392
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:43,962
He didn't have to act tough.

393
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,215
Take care of him.

394
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,469
You see, Sa-eon is not one to talk
about his personal life.

395
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,055
But he told you. That means…

396
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:55,890
the green light.

397
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,392
"Green light"?

398
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:00,895
For us?

399
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,523
Hurry up and call him!

400
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,817
Ask if he's eaten.
Invite him out if he hasn't.

401
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,318
Tell him you'll eat with him.

402
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:11,406
Me? Be his friend?

403
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:13,992
SPOKESPERSON PAIK SA-EON

404
00:33:16,911 --> 00:33:17,745
Look.

405
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,914
You guys are connected.

406
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,506
Yeah.

407
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,799
Hello?

408
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,430
They found it?

409
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,405
I'll drive.

410
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:53,614
No, I'll do it.

411
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,117
Get in.

412
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,882
After skeletonization,
it becomes hard to identify a body

413
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:13,092
as well as the time of death.

414
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,678
Still, personal effects were found.

415
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:18,056
It'd be helpful if you could confirm them.

416
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:26,981
EVIDENCE

417
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,399
This bead…

418
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:31,652
is mine.

419
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,698
I lost in a game of marbles.

420
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:39,869
So I gave it to Yeong-seok.
And this is Min-woo's ring.

421
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:41,954
It's a big ring though.

422
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:48,211
His mom gave it to him…

423
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:52,924
after promising she'll be right back.

424
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,511
Though she didn't come back…

425
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,428
Then…

426
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,264
I guess that belonged to Jin-yeong.

427
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,184
The child who loved cars. Lee Jin-yeong.

428
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:06,646
Am I right?

429
00:35:36,884 --> 00:35:38,553
Here. Drink this.

430
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:43,307
Thank you.

431
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,476
Stop it. This is nothing.

432
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,190
Thank you for remembering
my friends with me.

433
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:00,366
You-ri, of all the people I know,

434
00:36:00,449 --> 00:36:01,868
you're the most cheerful.

435
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:08,249
So, whenever painful memories
I didn't want to remember flooded in,

436
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,336
I've managed to hold on.

437
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:17,258
It's all thanks to you.

438
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,224
Thank you.

439
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,817
The real Paik Sa-eon is alive,

440
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,569
and he's the one behind the threats?

441
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,029
Yeah.

442
00:36:42,909 --> 00:36:45,161
The pieces are finally coming together.

443
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,335
When I was young, I remember going out
to the yard after hearing Yu-jin cry.

444
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,426
Yu-jin! Are you okay?

445
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:03,971
<i>He looked around our age,</i>
<i>so I thought he was Paik Sa-eon.</i>

446
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,264
<i>But…</i>

447
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,934
when I first saw Paik Sa-eon,

448
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,394
he was much taller than the boy I saw.

449
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,357
So I thought maybe the boy wasn't him.

450
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:19,070
The boy you saw
was probably the real Paik Sa-eon.

451
00:37:19,153 --> 00:37:20,571
Probably.

452
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,740
And not long after that,

453
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,242
the car accident happened.

454
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,745
And the real Paik Sa-eon disappeared.

455
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:32,959
Then…

456
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:37,630
are you saying
the car accident might not be an accident?

457
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,300
What if…

458
00:37:42,426 --> 00:37:44,637
Yu-jin saw
the face of the real Paik Sa-eon,

459
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,765
the one the Paik family was hiding?

460
00:38:04,991 --> 00:38:06,742
Why didn't you answer my calls?

461
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,621
What are you doing here?

462
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,207
No, how dare you come here?

463
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,128
Are you really trying to push Hee-joo out
and take her place?

464
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,006
Why are you smiling?

465
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:21,841
Did I say something funny?

466
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:25,386
Hee-joo, let's talk later.

467
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:26,971
I should go.

468
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,018
They're making a fuss over catching
the culprit and the accomplice.

469
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:33,144
What's going on?

470
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:36,188
If this keeps up,
won't it affect the presidential race?

471
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:39,400
What if you can't become
the future president's daughter-in-law?

472
00:38:41,527 --> 00:38:44,655
I should've just married you off
to the Yeonghwa Construction family.

473
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,741
I was wrong.

474
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,162
No.

475
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:55,541
It's not my fault. She's the problem.

476
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,336
This happened because that wench
ran off before the wedding!

477
00:38:58,419 --> 00:38:59,545
I regret it too.

478
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,505
What?

479
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,716
I regret loving you.

480
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:05,760
No.

481
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,512
That wasn't love.

482
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:09,972
You…

483
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:14,393
Now that In-a's talking,
are you talking too?

484
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,730
I thought being obedient

485
00:39:18,939 --> 00:39:20,900
was a way to show you love.

486
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,902
If I did as you said,

487
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,947
I thought you'd love me back one day, but…

488
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:32,119
HOME

489
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:34,830
<i>Now that I've been loved…</i>

490
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:38,459
<i>and loved someone, I know.</i>

491
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,297
Love…

492
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:47,760
isn't about forcing
one-sided sacrifice like you do

493
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,555
or being unconditionally obedient like me.

494
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,183
"Sacrifice"?

495
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,144
Did I do this for my own benefit?

496
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:00,606
I did it because I wanted something better
for you!

497
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:02,441
Stop gaslighting me!

498
00:40:05,111 --> 00:40:06,821
I won't listen to you anymore.

499
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,074
Also, I'll never be

500
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,245
the president's daughter-in-law.

501
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,915
So wake up, please.

502
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,387
How dare she,

503
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,889
after everything I've done for her!

504
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,729
Drink this.

505
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,989
How did I forget?

506
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,911
Do you remember the DNA report
from before?

507
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:57,830
I said I didn't know who sent it.

508
00:40:59,081 --> 00:40:59,915
Yeah.

509
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:02,293
I think I now know who sent it.

510
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,045
Who?

511
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:45,836
Hong Hee-joo.

512
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:05,814
It's our wedding vows.

513
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:15,824
You don't need to read it all.
Just remember this.

514
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:20,246
One, the groom cannot initiate a divorce.

515
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:23,499
Two, divorce is prohibited
under any circumstances.

516
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,585
Three, we will actively announce
to the public

517
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:28,587
that we are a married couple.

518
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,131
If any of these are violated,

519
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:32,967
the penalty…

520
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:35,928
will be two billion won.

521
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,639
What are you doing?

522
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,893
I understand what it means now.

523
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:48,899
For me, it was way before that.

524
00:42:50,901 --> 00:42:52,611
Way before.

525
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:54,655
You said "way before."

526
00:42:55,698 --> 00:42:57,449
I don't know exactly when that is,

527
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,536
but I'm certain
that it was before three years ago.

528
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,747
Before the wedding,

529
00:43:04,873 --> 00:43:07,126
the person who sent the DNA report to In-a

530
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,295
was you, wasn't it?

531
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:29,356
<i>Is Hong Hee-joo marrying the son</i>
<i>of the Yeonghwa Construction family?</i>

532
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,774
<i>Is that true?</i>

533
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:36,155
<i>The only woman willing to sell</i>
<i>her daughter to him is Hee-joo's mom.</i>

534
00:43:36,238 --> 00:43:39,158
<i>The wedding will be held</i>
<i>as planned tomorrow.</i>

535
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:41,160
<i>However, let's switch the bride.</i>

536
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:44,246
<i>It won't be you. It'll be your sister.</i>

537
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,416
I wasn't a stand-in.

538
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,587
From the very start,

539
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,424
I was your wife.

540
00:44:01,263 --> 00:44:03,223
Once all of this is over,

541
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,480
will you marry me?

542
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:20,866
No.

543
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,663
Once all of this is over…

544
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,837
I'll propose to you.

545
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:03,826
I love you,

546
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:06,578
Hong Hee-joo.

547
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:41,238
Of the four discovered remains,

548
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:44,825
three were identified
with the help of personal items,

549
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:46,285
but for the remaining one,

550
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,370
we have no clue.

551
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,540
It will take some time
to analyze the remains and see

552
00:45:52,374 --> 00:45:53,459
if the DNA matches yours.

553
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:54,418
INCIDENT REPORT

554
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,819
YUN HYEON-SEONG

555
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,241
Hyeon-seong!

556
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,327
Hyeon-seong!

557
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,703
Hyeon-seong!

558
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:32,915
<i>Where are you?</i>

559
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:36,251
<i>Come out!</i>

560
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,212
<i>Hyeon-seong!</i>

561
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:55,646
<i>I found my friends thanks to you.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

562
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,900
<i>There's still one unidentified person.</i>

563
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,404
<i>One of the twins?</i>

564
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,324
<i>Yes.</i>

565
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,101
I was going to self-destruct too.

566
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,311
After I get my revenge,

567
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:42,317
once the goals and targets
that kept me going were gone,

568
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:47,614
I was going to disappear too.

569
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:49,700
What about now?

570
00:47:52,661 --> 00:47:54,121
Did you change your mind?

571
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,167
Of course.

572
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:03,380
I'm going to live a life
after taking revenge.

573
00:48:04,631 --> 00:48:05,924
With the person

574
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:10,804
I want to be with for the rest of my life.

575
00:48:17,978 --> 00:48:19,104
Will you try it again?

576
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,863
It's a shame your brother died,

577
00:48:28,447 --> 00:48:30,949
but what about the rest of your life?

578
00:48:35,662 --> 00:48:37,331
This is all because of him.

579
00:48:37,956 --> 00:48:41,251
How many lives need to be destroyed
before this comes to an end?

580
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,504
It's not…

581
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,091
over yet.

582
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,011
We have to catch him.

583
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:53,305
After that,

584
00:48:55,432 --> 00:48:57,601
I'll think about what comes next.

585
00:49:00,729 --> 00:49:02,439
I was relieved.

586
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,275
When I learned

587
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:11,990
that you weren't the Paik Sa-eon
I thought you were.

588
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:28,715
I'm in.

589
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:29,675
How many?

590
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:32,636
Park Do-jae said he planted spy chips
and tracking devices

591
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:35,055
in all the mobile devices
and transportation the guy uses.

592
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,684
Out of the three, two are inactive,
but one is still active.

593
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:41,353
Check the GPS and pinpoint
the exact location, quickly.

594
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:48,151
I heard Sa-eon caught the accomplice.

595
00:49:48,777 --> 00:49:50,070
What about the culprit?

596
00:49:50,987 --> 00:49:52,197
We found out

597
00:49:53,740 --> 00:49:55,701
who the culprit is.

598
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:01,039
Who is it?

599
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,253
I knew it.

600
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,380
You're not surprised at all.

601
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:13,176
But then, I guess you already knew.

602
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,263
Nothing gets by you
in this family, Father.

603
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,474
Just finish what you were saying.
Who's the culprit?

604
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,519
Before I tell you,
I have to ask you something.

605
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:27,023
The reason you covered up
our car accident.

606
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,569
What deal did you make
with Chairman Paik Jang-ho?

607
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,918
The bastard who ran my kids over.

608
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:51,006
I chased him to the Philippines
and got him to confess

609
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,800
just before I was about to take his life.

610
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:56,219
So don't try to deny it.

611
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,556
Have you calculated it thoroughly?

612
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:02,517
After you shoot me,

613
00:51:03,268 --> 00:51:04,519
what will you have left?

614
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:09,399
You invested tens of billions of won
in my presidential campaign.

615
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:11,526
You already lost your son.

616
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:16,323
And if you shoot me,
you'll also lose the money.

617
00:51:16,406 --> 00:51:17,574
Are you okay with that?

618
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,035
You know me well.

619
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:25,415
You know I'm someone who's more sensitive
to losses than to gains.

620
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:29,377
Would it be a little better
if the losses weren't all on you?

621
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:34,716
By now,
they should be walking side by side.

622
00:51:36,343 --> 00:51:37,219
What does that mean?

623
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,554
On the road to the afterlife.

624
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,141
Your son and my grandson.

625
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:45,268
How's that?

626
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:48,855
Is it starting to add up now?

627
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,485
Tell us now.

628
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:55,612
What did you throw away?

629
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:57,113
And what did you gain?

630
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,036
<i>Hurry and come to the memorial service.</i>

631
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:46,872
<i>I've got a bad feeling.</i>

632
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,545
Mr. Hong.

633
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:55,714
Mr. Hong.

634
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:00,760
What do you think you're doing?

635
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:05,849
YUNHWA-RI

636
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:08,685
We got it.
He's near Yunhwa-ri, Sanseong-myeon.

637
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:10,270
We got the bastard.

638
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:12,898
- Head out.
- Yes, sir.

639
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,652
Didn't I warn you?

640
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:23,491
That if that thing in your family
was still alive,

641
00:53:24,242 --> 00:53:26,703
I'd chop it up from head to toe

642
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,163
and scatter the pieces.

643
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,167
Give him to me.

644
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,588
Where is he?

645
00:53:51,728 --> 00:53:53,647
Guards!

646
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,261
It's a fire! Evacuate!

647
00:54:29,724 --> 00:54:31,226
Dad!

648
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:32,686
We have to go!

649
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,355
It's a fire!

650
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:43,488
- Yes, Detective Kang.
<i>- We got his location.</i>

Are you okay?

654
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,396
I can't find Hee-joo! We were together.

655
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:18,148
I'll find her.

656

Don't get worked up.

I get excited when you get worked up.

Your turn will come soon,
so don't make a fuss and just wait.

I'll make him rise up from his grave!

684

01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:03,850
but the passengers
have not been found yet.

730
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,852
According to the police investigation,

731
01:00:05,935 --> 01:00:08,688
this vehicle that crashed into the river
was being driven by…

732
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:16,154
Paik Sa-eon's wife after being abducted.

733
01:00:16,237 --> 01:00:17,905
This news has left many in shock.

734
01:00:17,989 --> 01:00:21,618
The police have released
a composite sketch of the suspect

735
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:23,870
and issued an emergency wanted notice.

736
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:25,747
<i>In relation to this, Spokesperson Paik</i>

737
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,041
<i>will hold a press conference</i>
<i>to announce his position.</i>

738
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,751
- There he is.
- There he is.

739
01:00:29,834 --> 01:00:33,087
Hurry! Take photos of him.

740
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,275
That's enough! Please!

741
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:57,278
This isn't a scandal. It's an incident!
A criminal case!

742
01:01:14,504 --> 01:01:18,091
First, I have something to say
to the people.

743
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,135
For a long time,

744
01:01:22,887 --> 01:01:24,555
I've kept something hidden.

745
01:01:26,474 --> 01:01:27,392
I am…

746
01:01:29,268 --> 01:01:31,270
not the son of Presidential Candidate…

747
01:01:33,106 --> 01:01:34,065
Paik Ui-yong.

748
01:01:35,066 --> 01:01:38,069
I am not the grandson…

749
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:40,947
of Chairman Paik Jang-ho.

750
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,576
Both the name Paik Sa-eon

751
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,996
and my identity as Paik Ui-yong's son

752
01:01:50,331 --> 01:01:51,624
<i>are all fake.</i>

753
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,418
SPOKESPERSON PAIK,
"I'M NOT PAIK SA-EON…"

754
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:54,502
<i>It does not belong to me.</i>

755
01:01:57,004 --> 01:02:01,008
If there is one thing
I can say truthfully about myself,

756
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:04,303
it's that…

757
01:02:06,347 --> 01:02:09,934
I'm married, and I have a wife.

758
01:02:10,977 --> 01:02:14,188
My wife was kidnapped
on the 20th, two days ago,

759
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:18,693
by the person who had been threatening
to kill me.

760
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,571
Investigations and searches are ongoing,

761
01:02:21,654 --> 01:02:25,324
but my wife's whereabouts
have not yet been determined.

762
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:28,161
In relation to this, I stand before you

763
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:30,204
not as Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon

764
01:02:30,705 --> 01:02:32,123
but as…

765
01:02:33,624 --> 01:02:34,709
a husband,

766
01:02:35,293 --> 01:02:36,627
to humbly request

767
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:41,883
your cooperation and help.

768
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,106
My wife's name is…

769
01:02:57,857 --> 01:02:59,358
<i>Hong Hee-joo.</i>

770
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,654
<i>She's 28 years old, 167cm tall…</i>

771
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:04,822
That's Hong…

772
01:03:04,906 --> 01:03:06,365
Did you not know either?

773
01:03:06,449 --> 01:03:09,911
<i>At the time of her disappearance,</i>
<i>she was wearing a black suit</i>

774
01:03:09,994 --> 01:03:13,456
<i>and black shoes</i>
<i>and had long, straight hair.</i>

775
01:03:20,379 --> 01:03:24,425
And she's the sign language interpreter
of the Presidential Office.

776
01:03:25,343 --> 01:03:27,637
<i>I look forward</i>
<i>to working with you as well.</i>

777
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,225
<i>Is there something you want to do?</i>

778
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:33,601
Well…

779
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:37,647
There is.

780
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:41,609
Things that I never imagined
we could do together.

781
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,195
I know it's ridiculous,

782
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:47,532
but I imagined it sometimes.

783
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:50,117
Us being…

784
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:53,663
<i>completely ordinary</i>
<i>just like everyone else.</i>

785
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,460
There's a lot I haven't done for her.

786
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,712
Let's be happy together.

787
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,675
I haven't made her happy yet.

788
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,427
Once all of this is over…

789
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,309
I'll propose to you.

790
01:04:16,644 --> 01:04:18,729
If I had known I wouldn't get the chance,

791
01:04:21,065 --> 01:04:23,359
I would've just given her everything.

792
01:04:25,278 --> 01:04:27,780
SPOKESPERSON PAIK
DEVASTATED BY HIS WIFE'S ABDUCTION

793
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,115
Hee-joo…

794
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,118
<i>Please.</i>

795
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:34,620
<i>If anyone has seen my wife,</i>

796
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:37,164
<i>please report it now.</i>

797
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,792
Please, I ask for your attention and help

798
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:44,589
so that my wife can return safely.

799
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:30,217
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

800
01:05:43,022 --> 01:05:44,231
Why was I born?

801
01:05:45,900 --> 01:05:46,984
I always thought about it.

802
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:51,447
If I have to live someone else's life
against my will,

803
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:54,158
why was I born?

804
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,750
But I think I found the answer.

805
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,503
To why I was born

806
01:06:06,212 --> 01:06:08,798
and why I had to live as Paik Sa-eon.

807
01:06:10,633 --> 01:06:11,550
It was…

808
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:18,766
to meet you.

809
01:07:15,823 --> 01:07:17,867
