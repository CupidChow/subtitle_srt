1
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:46,963
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,544
What happened?

3
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,513
What happened next?

4
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,437
Can you guess who it is?

5
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,772
Someone who's close to you

6
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,442
and knows you…

7
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,698
The waveform analysis indicates
a woman in her twenties.

8
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,329
Compare it with 406.

9
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,789
See how much they match in percentage.

10
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,124
Up to two decimal places.

11
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:34,547
EPISODE 6

12
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,368
Why…

13
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,956
were we lying on the floor together
last night?

14
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,295
What? What is it?

15
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,096
What is it?

16
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:26,474
Tell me if something happened.

17
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,695
Should I tell you everything honestly?

18
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:41,447
Honest…

19
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,367
"Tell you everything honestly"?

20
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:24,490
PARK DO-JAE

21
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:28,870
Yes?

22
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:29,787
Mr. Paik.

23
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,622
What happened?

24
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,541
Your phone was off. I was worried.

25
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,918
I'm sorry.

26
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,003
It just happened.

27
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:39,589
As for the favor I asked for yesterday?

28
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:40,840
Did you not see it?

29
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,342
I sent you a text last night.

30
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:45,219
But you never responded.

31
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:06,657
It's a 99.99% match.

32
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,955
I made a summary of all the events so far.

33
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,791
From the first threatening call

34
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,543
to the recent incident
at the nursing home.

35
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:18,878
I came to one conclusion.

36
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,671
The caller, 406, isn't involved

37
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,591
in the kidnapping, explosion,
and nursing home incident.

38
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,634
There's someone else.

39
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,678
I know that.

40
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:29,722
They're not accomplices.

41
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:34,936
You have an idea who 406 might be,
don't you?

42
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,187
I'm sorry.

43
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:38,648
I can't tell you right now.

44
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:43,653
For now, let's find the connection
between him and 406 and break it.

45
00:06:45,113 --> 00:06:46,364
After that…

46
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,449
Are you okay?

47
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,077
You don't look well.

48
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,497
I'm fine.

49
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,042
Yes, sir.

50
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,211
If you need anything--

51
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:01,337
No.

52
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:03,923
I'm not okay.

53
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:10,888
You see,

54
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,351
I thought
I'd controlled situations perfectly

55
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,520
and made better judgments than anyone.

56
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:20,857
I thought I had lived meticulously

57
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,111
not to fall into any traps.

58
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:30,450
But…

59
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,577
why didn't I know?

60
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,787
When I think back,

61
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,623
there were more than a few hints.

62
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,462
Maybe I just ignored them.

63
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,756
I firmly believed it couldn't be true,

64
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,176
desperately hoping it wasn't.

65
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,137
But I shouldn't have done that.

66
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:54,098
I should've at least prepared myself.

67
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,225
If I had,

68
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,729
I wouldn't be at a loss for what to do.

69
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:04,525
You have until tomorrow to decide.

70
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:07,278
Or we can settle for two billion won.

71
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,529
You have until tomorrow.

72
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,656
It's not like you married her for love.

73
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,283
You don't even love her now.

74
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,118
If it's going to be like that,

75
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:17,538
just leave her.

76
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:25,588
THE SEVENTH CALL

77
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,382
Then why did you treat her
like she was invisible?

78
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:39,477
THE THIRD CALL

79
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,811
It's Hong Hee-joo's…

80
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,984
thigh.

81
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,200
You're supposed to be her husband.

82
00:08:54,825 --> 00:08:57,662
Didn't you know
Hee-joo has a unique mole on her thigh?

83
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,331
How could you not know?

84
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,000
Were you just not interested? Or…

85
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,462
have you never seen her naked?

86
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,097
Enough.

87
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,054
It grew longer as I wrote.

88
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,433
100 QUESTIONS, 100 ANSWERS

89
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:05,980
Wait. I forgot one.

90
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,321
LIES, ANGER, HATRED,
MISUNDERSTANDING, FORGIVENESS

91
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:14,780
What's the sign language

92
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,282
for forgiveness?

93
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:28,336
What about "I forgive your wrongdoings"?

94
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,076
It's difficult.

95
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,036
Forgiveness.

96
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,250
Let's end today's class here.

97
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,907
YOU DIDN'T TEXT BACK,
SO I'M TEXTING AGAIN. LET'S MEET UP TODAY.

98
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,294
SIGN LANGUAGE

99
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:01,887
The pre-candidate registration
for the 21st presidential election,

100
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:05,141
which will be held in March next year,
will begin next week.

101
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,309
Sir.

102
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,146
It's about the task
you asked me to check regularly.

103
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:14,150
Regarding Chairman Hong Il-gyeong's
eldest daughter, Hong In-a.

104
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,141
Honey.

105
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,227
Chairman Hong's eldest daughter
is back in Korea.

106
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:53,939
So what?

107
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,108
What do you mean?

108
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,235
You should meet with her.

109
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:00,738
And ask her why she caused that mess.

110
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,657
No, before that, see if we can control…

111
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:05,993
Are you drinking?

112
00:13:08,162 --> 00:13:09,246
Are you drunk?

113
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,083
Can't I be drunk?

114
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:15,586
On a day like today?

115
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:18,088
What's today?

116
00:13:20,257 --> 00:13:21,091
What is it?

117
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,306
A day no one can remember.

118
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:31,435
A day that shouldn't be remembered.

119
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,022
That's what your father decided.

120
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:36,106
So what?

121
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,654
Why? Must you pretend to care?

122
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,823
Would that ease your guilt a little?

123
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,867
Don't make me laugh.

124
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:49,620
Twenty years ago today,

125
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:52,540
both you and I know how we really felt!

126
00:13:55,793 --> 00:13:56,627
What?

127
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,131
A sense of freedom.

128
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:07,740
IS IT IMPOSSIBLE
TO CHANGE INNATE TEMPERAMENT?

129
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,151
Goodness.

130
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,402
You must be In-a.

131
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,489
How dare you touch me
with your filthy hands?

132
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:57,975
Hee-joo.

133
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:04,606
How have you been?

134
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:12,072
Do you remember?

135
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,783
We'd visit the aquarium often as kids.

136
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,912
It felt like all the sounds
in the world disappeared

137
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,833
when I stared into the water like this.

138
00:17:23,792 --> 00:17:25,294
It made me feel at peace.

139
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,465
Let's see the mermaid show you like.

140
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:30,883
It starts soon.

141
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:33,343
Isn't it amazing?

142
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,721
Hearing me chattering like this.

143
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,098
I must've been lucky.

144
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,100
The surgery was a success.

145
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:43,228
No surgery could fix me when I was young.

146
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,486
But, Hee-joo…

147
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,490
why are you still the same?

148
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,367
You can talk now.

149
00:17:58,035 --> 00:17:59,620
You don't need to keep quiet.

150
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,756
You knew?

151
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:12,382
Yeah.

152
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,011
You didn't speak…

153
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,640
because of me.

154
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,609
I know.

155
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,278
I did a terrible thing to you.

156
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,739
I know it was awful of me,

157
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,409
but I didn't want to fall apart alone.

158
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:42,037
I needed someone to be miserable

159
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,998
with me.

160
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:48,794
Hee-joo.

161
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,672
So what?

162
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,550
Now that you're okay,
are you allowing me to speak?

163
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,928
No, that's not up to you.

164
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:00,389
I'll decide it.

165
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,808
I won't let you interfere
in my life anymore.

166
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:06,895
You don't know what I'm saying, do you?

167
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,147
It doesn't matter.

168
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:10,732
I'll say what I want,
just like what you're doing.

169
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:17,197
THE LITTLE MERMAID'S MYSTERIOUS ADVENTURE

170
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,077
I don't like The Little Mermaid.

171
00:19:22,786 --> 00:19:23,620
I hate her.

172
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,185
IN-A

173
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:01,742
Hee-joo.

174
00:20:02,826 --> 00:20:05,287
I needed to tell you something today.

175
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,707
Do you think you know Paik Sa-eon well?

176
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:17,382
Before the wedding,
I didn't dump you on him.

177
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:19,301
He asked for you.

178
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:21,386
In return for letting me go,

179
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,223
he needed a connection to our family,

180
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,724
so he took you hostage.

181
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:35,651
I came to one conclusion.

182
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,819
The caller, 406, isn't involved

183
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:40,697
in the kidnapping, explosion,
and nursing home incident.

184
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,740
There's someone else.

185
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,115
It's just…

186
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,743
My phone's missing.

187
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,120
Why is he looking for that here?

188
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,875
CALLS
PAIK SA-EON

189
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:33,435
Wait.

190
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,145
What's this?

191
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,276
So Hee-joo was…

192
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,529
into this kind of thing?

193
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:28,865
Did I…

194
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:31,701
I mean,

195
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:33,787
did we…

196
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:36,540
by any chance…

197
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,169
I must be insane.

198
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:01,666
How did you know?

199
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,002
About what?

200
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:07,005
That I've been thinking about you
all day long.

201
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:10,050
We spoke on the phone every day.

202
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:14,262
But there are still so many things
I don't know about you.

203
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,308
So now I want to know more.

204
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:20,477
Then…

205
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,606
how about we each
ask a question and answer?

206
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:25,523
Sounds good.

207
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:27,651
However, from this moment on,

208
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:30,362
we'll only speak the truth.

209
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:32,030
That's what I want.

210
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,783
Go ahead.

211
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,202
The day before the wedding,

212
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,247
you said you met In-a and made a deal.

213
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:45,126
Was the deal about Hong Hee-joo?

214
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,044
Yes.

215
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:48,213
It's my turn.

216
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,591
What? My question isn't over yet.

217
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,134
I answered, so it's over.

218
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:55,637
Think carefully next time before you ask.

219
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:57,973
It's my turn.

220
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:01,810
Is Hong Hee-joo being threatened
right now?

221
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:05,230
Why do you think she's being threatened?

222
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,399
406, you kidnapped Hee-joo

223
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,317
and even attacked her father.

224
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:11,069
You're completely insane.

225
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,572
Hee-joo would never side

226
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,741
with someone like you.

227
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,788
She's being threatened,
but also not, okay?

228
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:23,832
It's my turn now.

229
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,293
Did you take Hong Hee-joo hostage

230
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,504
in exchange for letting Hong In-a
go free from the arranged marriage?

231
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:32,799
Who told you that?

232
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,052
Seeing how you're asking that,
I guess it's true.

233
00:26:37,804 --> 00:26:38,638
It's true.

234
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,349
I…

235
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,935
often have nightmares.

236
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:46,521
I had them more often as a kid.

237
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:15,884
I will

238
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:17,552
help you.

239
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,139
I will be with you.

240
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:24,893
It's okay.

241
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:26,853
It's okay.

242
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:45,705
It's okay.

243
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,588
It's okay.

244
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,007
What calmed me down every time…

245
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,886
were the gestures of the girl next door

246
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,640
who practiced sign language every night.

247
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:07,602
But that girl

248
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,105
had no one

249
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,066
to rely on, anywhere.

250
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,194
Because to her,

251
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:20,240
Chairman Hong's house was a prison.

252
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,244
I wanted to help her escape.

253
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,454
Hoping that she could

254
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:29,707
leave that house and live freely.

255
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,002
But I never imagined…

256
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,089
that I would become…

257
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,259
Hee-joo's new prison.

258
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,469
Prison?

259
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:44,305
A married life with me

260
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:47,058
after leaving that house

261
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,438
must've felt like a prison to her.

262
00:28:52,397 --> 00:28:55,233
That must be why she got mixed up
with some crazy person

263
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,027
in order to divorce me, right?

264
00:29:01,114 --> 00:29:02,365
It's my turn now.

265
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,785
Does Hong Hee-joo…

266
00:29:07,412 --> 00:29:08,830
still want a divorce?

267
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,004
Answer me, 406.

268
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,465
Isn't that what you kept saying?

269
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,384
To let Hee-joo go
and return things to the way they were.

270
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,387
To let go of her.

271
00:29:28,016 --> 00:29:30,310
She didn't want
to get her hopes up anymore.

272
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,687
"Someday,

273
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:35,857
things will change."

274
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,696
"It'll get better."
She waited and hoped for three years.

275
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,573
If you let her go,

276
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:46,367
she thought she wouldn't get hurt

277
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,996
or be disappointed anymore.

278
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,373
That's what Hong Hee-joo thought.

279
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:53,708
By any chance,

280
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:56,836
does Hee-joo want…

281
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,424
SINCERITY

282
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:02,592
sincerity,

283
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:05,386
attention,

284
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,679
understanding,

285
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:08,306
and affection?

286
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,391
Is that what she wants?

287
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,479
What are you saying? What I'm saying--

288
00:30:14,562 --> 00:30:15,897
I can give that to her.

289
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,904
I can give her everything.

290
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,828
If that's what Hee-joo wants,
I'll give as much as she needs.

291
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,039
Why do you suddenly want to do that?

292
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,794
You didn't care whether I lived or died,

293
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:40,129
or whether I was by your side, until now.

294
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:42,090
From the very start,

295
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,011
this wasn't a marriage Hee-joo wanted.

296
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:50,265
I kept her by my side as a hostage,

297
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,768
thinking that someday…

298
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,354
I'd have to let her go.

299
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,650
Is that why you were so cruel?

300
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,069
So you wouldn't get attached?

301
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,405
But if that's what Hee-joo wants,

302
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:07,574
it changes things.

303
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:11,494
Then promise me.

304
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,746
If I make an effort

305
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:16,708
and we can change,

306
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,795
promise you'll never make this call again.

307
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:28,344
That depends on how you act.

308
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,180
Oh, my, ma'am.

309
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:15,558
You look so young and beautiful today.

310
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,435
Of course.

311
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:19,896
My age may increase,
but my skirt length shouldn't.

312
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:21,064
Of course.

313
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,734
Can't you dress a bit younger too?

314
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:28,738
Why should I have to struggle
to look younger?

315
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:32,575
You're right.

316
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,160
It wouldn't suit you.

317
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,038
You already have a gorgeous charm
about you.

318
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,627
Okay, then.

319
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,295
Get in. Good luck today.

320
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,715
Let's go. Okay.

321
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,026
How much is Spokesperson Paik asking for?

322
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:07,944
What?

323
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,487
What's his price?

324
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,322
Good luck with the negotiation.

325
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,865
Between parents and children,

326
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,243
there should be
some playful give-and-take.

327
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,160
I don't know.

328
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,747
Don't you know as well as I do?

329
00:33:20,581 --> 00:33:22,667
Getting a stubborn child to listen

330
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:25,503
is harder than practicing discipline.

331
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:28,047
Your eldest daughter.

332
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:30,675
Do you know how she's doing?

333
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,470
Why would you suddenly bring her up?

334
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,348
She comes to mind lately.

335
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,144
I wonder how she's doing.

336
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,863
-Are you ready for this?
-I've never been to a retreat before.

337
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,157
-I've organized this well.
-I am a little nervous.

338
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,284
Is that like your security pillow?

339
00:33:57,118 --> 00:33:59,954
So only Mr. Paik and Mr. Park
aren't here yet?

340
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,789
-Should I call them?
-Nah.

341
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,916
What? What's that?

342
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,127
What is that?

343
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:07,628
THANK YOU, SPOKESPERSON'S TEAM

344
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,214
WHEEL LUNCHBOX

345
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:13,885
TO THE SPOKESPERSON'S TEAM, THANK YOU

346
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:15,553
Let's go.

347
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,852
The staff from the spokesperson's office?

348
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,021
-Yes.
-The lunchboxes have arrived.

349
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,567
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

350
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,360
Pass these out.

351
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,653
Take that.

352
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,073
Thank you.

353
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:37,075
Goodness.

354
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,120
-Do you have mine?
-Goodness.

355
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:42,371
Look at the hearts.

356
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,917
"An office full of love."

357
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,877
Is that what this is, Mr. Kang?

358
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,004
It wasn't me. I didn't order these.

359
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,339
Who sent these?

360
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,007
I don't know.

361
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:56,344
Is everyone here?

362
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,513
-Hello.
-Hello.

363
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,768
The lunchboxes came too.

364
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:07,271
Wait, did you order these, sir?

365
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,115
-Let's go.
-Wait…

366
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,742
-What?
-What's going on?

367
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,453
-Let… Let's go.
-What?

368
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,413
Look at this heart.

369
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,208
I didn't know
he'd prepare lunchboxes for us.

370
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:51,732
Is this seat taken?

371
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,365
Do you want one?

372
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,418
I get…

373
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:12,962
carsick.

374
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:17,258
Doesn't it get worse
if you sit in the back?

375
00:36:17,925 --> 00:36:20,428
Right. Then why don't you sit there?

376
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,974
I think I'll leave my things here.

377
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:25,892
I see.

378
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:28,686
Then would you like to sit here?

379
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:31,981
Thank you.

380
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,990
Coffee…

381
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:44,076
isn't good on an empty stomach, Ms. Hong.

382
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:52,543
Proof?

383
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:56,255
Are we cops or something?
How can we find proof?

384
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,549
A witness?

385
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,137
There's no proof.
How would we find a witness?

386
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,349
Not to mention,
these kids don't have a family.

387
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,852
It's in the development stage.
If we keep digging…

388
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,897
Hello?

389
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,065
Mr. Han?

390
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,692
What?

391
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:18,194
He just hung up on me.

392
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:19,904
Do they want to toss it?

393
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,824
-Well…
-"If the NeoTuber's story is fake,

394
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:25,243
will you take responsibility?"

395
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:26,994
Why would I take responsibility?

396
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:27,954
You have to.

397
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,707
Why are you helping so enthusiastically?

398
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,376
Because…

399
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,464
Why are you buying so much?

400
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,299
It's not that much.

401
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,178
At least for hungry little ones
whose stomachs can never be filled.

402
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:47,723
I'm a huge fan of hers!

403
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,392
I need to get her autograph.

404
00:37:50,726 --> 00:37:51,727
I don't believe it.

405
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,813
Thank you so much.

406
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,857
-Hello!
-Cool.

407
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,694
Thank you.

408
00:38:02,196 --> 00:38:04,615
Are you Dr. Sang-woo's girlfriend?

409
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:06,325
What?

410
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:07,702
Want to see his dark past?

411
00:38:07,785 --> 00:38:10,371
If you still like him after,
it's real love.

412
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:13,541
No, wait.
I'm not Dr. Sang-woo's girlfriend.

413
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,308
Guys, let's eat!

414
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,729
Be careful.

415
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,480
Be careful.

416
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,570
Let's eat.

417
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,072
No, you can't look!

418
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,532
Wait! Hey!

419
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:48,617
Hey! This isn't right.

420
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:57,668
This picture…

421
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:04,342
I heard the kids started disappearing
around this time.

422
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,926
This was before you came here.

423
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:08,095
Do you know anything?

424
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,389
No, I don't.

425
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,059
Did any of the birth parents come back
later on?

426
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,360
So, the missing kids
had no family searching for them

427
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:27,198
and no one to remember them all this time.

428
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:34,705
Shin Yeong-seok liked to play marbles,
and he was so competitive.

429
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,626
Lee Jin-yeong liked cars.

430
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,961
Park Min-woo. He was so…

431
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:43,589
Such a troublemaker.

432
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,758
I remember them.

433
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,053
These three.

434
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:52,723
That's strange.

435
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:54,725
I heard

436
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,978
that four kids disappeared.

437
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,522
There's one more?

438
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:01,816
Yes, here.

439
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,030
One of the twin brothers.

440
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:39,103
CHANGE OF PLAN. TODAY'S D-DAY.

441
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,267
Hey, honey.

442
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,144
No, I wasn't sleeping.

443
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:46,397
Is it hard on your own?
Sorry, I couldn't go.

444
00:42:48,023 --> 00:42:48,857
What?

445
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:53,237
Yeah.

446
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,157
I love you,
my ultimate love in the universe!

447
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,993
Park Eun-yeong, I love you so much!

448
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,297
I apologize.

449
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,934
How do you do that?

450
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:24,852
Excuse me?

451
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,688
What you just did.

452
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:30,941
"I love you,
ultimate love in the universe."

453
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:32,109
You're good at that.

454
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,027
You know,

455
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,405
it's only hard at first,
but it gets easier to do.

456
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:40,743
Think of it as adding a little flavor
to the affection you usually show.

457
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,077
Say it with a kiss.

458
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:46,790
Wait,

459
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:49,960
you do show affection, right?

460
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,302
You've been married for about…

461
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,219
Three years.

462
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,640
You're practically newlyweds. So why?

463
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:08,437
You know, time sure does fly.

464
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,690
It feels like I got married yesterday,
but it's already been ten years.

465
00:44:12,399 --> 00:44:14,568
Time flies by so quickly,

466
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:16,612
what's the use of saving it?

467
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:20,491
When she's by your side,
tell her you love her

468
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:22,326
and thank her

469
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:24,536
as much as you can.

470
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,810
We've unpacked and warmed up now.

471
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,937
Thank you for the lunchboxes, Mr. Paik!

472
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:50,854
Thank you.

473
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:53,941
Now that we're full,
shall we start the sports competition?

474
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:54,983
Gosh.

475
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,236
Someone stop Mr. Kang.

476
00:44:57,319 --> 00:45:00,072
Yeah. Who knew he was so into events?

477
00:45:00,155 --> 00:45:03,409
All events will be played in pairs.

478
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:06,495
The teams will be
the spokespersons versus the interpreters.

479
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,288
Let's team up, Hee-joo.

480
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,541
No.

481
00:45:10,624 --> 00:45:14,044
We came to build a rapport
with the interpreters.

482
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:17,423
What's the point of this retreat
if you arrange the teams like that?

483
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:19,550
Shall we mix them, perhaps?

484
00:45:19,633 --> 00:45:22,344
Mr. Paik, why don't you pick
one of the interpreters first…

485
00:45:22,428 --> 00:45:23,637
Okay.

486
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,520
Let's team up, Ms. Hong.

487
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:34,273
Then, that's one team!

488
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:38,068
-Good luck.
-Everyone else can team up too.

489
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,028
What's the prize?

490
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:43,532
-The winning team--
-Let them pick.

491
00:45:43,615 --> 00:45:46,743
-Excuse me?
-The winning team can pick their prize.

492
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:48,328
Let's start.

493
00:45:49,663 --> 00:45:50,581
What they want!

494
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,332
Warm up.

495
00:46:00,424 --> 00:46:02,676
The first event is just a warm-up.

496
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:05,220
We'll start with
a two-person jump rope challenge!

497
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:06,763
Now.

498
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:10,726
There's a lot of room for mistakes
in this event, so you'll get two chances.

499
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:13,854
We'll start with Park Do-jae
and Kim Tae-kyeong.

500
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:15,397
-Okay, spin it.
-Good luck.

501
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,778
Here I go.

502
00:46:21,862 --> 00:46:22,696
That was good.

503
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:23,614
That's good!

504
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,282
Nice!

505
00:46:25,365 --> 00:46:28,118
I'll go in first.
Make sure to time it right and jump.

506
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:31,121
Speed, reflexes, timing, and focus
are all important.

507
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:32,414
Mr. Park, you look so calm.

508
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,124
Seven, eight!

509
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,709
That's too bad.

510
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:36,627
How many?

511
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:38,629
That makes it seven.

512
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,713
-Now, next.
-Good job.

513
00:46:39,796 --> 00:46:40,631
Okay, next.

514
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,840
Mr. Paik's team.

515
00:46:45,385 --> 00:46:46,220
Come on.

516
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,558
One.

517
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,560
Are you okay?

518
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:55,729
-Take it easy.
-That's zero.

519
00:46:56,563 --> 00:46:57,648
Mr. Paik, you're out!

520
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,026
I'm sorry.

521
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,907
Once again. Next.

522
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,951
It's smooth this time.

523
00:47:09,034 --> 00:47:10,661
Now.

524
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,454
I've figured out the trick.

525
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:13,914
I can do a good job this time.

526
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,875
Once I find the rhythm after a few jumps,
then you can--

527
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:18,418
Are you listening?

528
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,420
I'll go first. Just follow me.

529
00:47:21,046 --> 00:47:22,673
Twelve.

530
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:24,174
How many was that?

531
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,009
-It's 12 this time.
-Okay.

532
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,220
Okay, let's get Mr. Paik's team.
Team Paik?

533
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,062
-Now!
-There you go! Okay!

534
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,985
-You have to go.
-Go, Mr. Paik!

535
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,153
We'll count once Mr. Paik comes in.

536
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:22,232
We finally found one.

537
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:23,442
The victim's family.

538
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:28,071
If his little brother is alive
and if he was looking for his brother,

539
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:31,074
then he may know something.

540
00:48:31,992 --> 00:48:33,160
I know.

541
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,578
But…

542
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:37,789
it won't be easy to figure out
where he is or how he's living.

543
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:41,793
Well, the director said that
the old documents were lost or discarded

544
00:48:41,877 --> 00:48:43,420
when the operating foundation changed.

545
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:44,379
Well, for now,

546
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,674
I'll ask the kids from the orphanage
I can get in touch with.

547
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,053
That's a great idea.

548
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:03,482
It's the finals for the three-legged race.

549
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,484
Mr. Paik and Hong Hee-joo

550
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,944
versus Jeong Won-bin and Ahn Jin-hee.

551
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:11,114
Who will be the winning team?

552
00:49:15,535 --> 00:49:17,663
And they're off! Team Paik!

553
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,582
They're running neck-and-neck!

554
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,959
-Be careful!
-Go, Mr. Paik!

555
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:24,127
Anyone, just win!

556
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:26,588
-Good luck!
-That's a three-legged race!

557
00:49:26,672 --> 00:49:29,758
Won-bin's team is slowing down!
The finish line is just ahead!

558
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:31,843
And they're down! Team Paik!

559
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,186
Team Paik wins!

560
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:43,647
Paik Sa-eon! Hong Hee-joo!

561
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,858
-Paik Sa-eon! Hong Hee-joo!
-Paik Sa-eon!

562
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,624
I'm sorry. I got carried away.

563
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:06,420
Okay.

564
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:08,422
Anyway, congrats!

565
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:10,841
What prize should we prepare
for the winning team?

566
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,467
Tell me if you want something.

567
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,886
There is something I want.

568
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,435
The weather's nice. The angle's nice.

569
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,602
And the models…

570
00:50:23,687 --> 00:50:26,606
Did you two fight already?

571
00:50:26,690 --> 00:50:28,775
Can you move closer together?

572
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:31,820
Yes, that's good.

573
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,574
But is one photo really enough?

574
00:50:35,657 --> 00:50:37,576
I mean, it's your first place prize.

575
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:39,536
There's meat and rice.

576
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:40,704
I don't need it.

577
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:43,874
A souvenir photo will be enough.

578
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,418
Okay, then.

579
00:50:47,085 --> 00:50:47,919
Now.

580
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,087
Smile.

581
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,257
Bigger!

582
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:56,052
That's good.

583
00:50:56,136 --> 00:50:58,305
Now… Tilt your head.

584
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,807
Tilt. No, towards the middle, Mr. Paik.

585
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:03,351
There you go. That's good. That's perfect!

586
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:04,936
Good. Don't move.

587
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,396
Make a hand heart.

588
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,508
That's great.

589
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,384
Now.

590
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,511
I'll take it now.

591
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:38,428
Good.

592
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,930
Smile!

593
00:51:52,567 --> 00:51:53,693
Wait.

594
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,861
Let's rest.

595
00:51:55,654 --> 00:51:57,364
Let's rest for a little.

596
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,449
But you're dressed for the Himalayas.

597
00:52:00,283 --> 00:52:01,451
Yeah.

598
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:03,829
Why did you want to hike this mountain?

599
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:05,831
Did I suggest it? Did I?

600
00:52:06,581 --> 00:52:09,167
That man flying up there did.

601
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:11,670
Wow, well…

602
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:14,089
Can you believe Hong Hee-joo's stamina?

603
00:52:14,172 --> 00:52:15,257
It's unexpected.

604
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,925
It's not just her stamina.

605
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:19,427
Don't those two have good chemistry?

606
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:20,554
I felt it too.

607
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:21,847
During the three-legged race,

608
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:23,014
-they were so in sync.
-Yes!

609
00:52:23,098 --> 00:52:24,391
He's a married man!

610
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:25,725
You scared me!

611
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:27,978
You said it before too.

612
00:52:28,061 --> 00:52:31,439
That sparks flew between the two
on the day of the interview.

613
00:52:31,523 --> 00:52:32,732
-When did I?
-Goodness.

614
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:35,527
That's enough nonsense. Help me up.

615
00:52:36,736 --> 00:52:38,613
Here. One, two!

616
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,245
Is that shirt all you have?

617
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,016
It's cold once the sweat dries.

618
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,392
Wear it later.

619
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:59,903
-Where'd you buy your hiking clothes?
-That's not the issue right now.

620
00:54:00,779 --> 00:54:02,155
You dressed up the most.

621
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,239
Over here.

622
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:05,241
Who's the youngest among us?

623
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,077
Me. I am.

624
00:54:25,178 --> 00:54:26,513
It's so pretty.

625
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:42,779
We're here.

626
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:47,951
It's beautiful.

627
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:51,496
Hee-joo.

628
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:53,206
Shall we take a photo together?

629
00:54:53,289 --> 00:54:54,457
-Yeah.
-Sounds good.

630
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,379
One, two, three.

631
00:55:01,506 --> 00:55:04,050
Great job, everyone.

632
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,386
Come and gather. Let's take a group photo.

633
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:07,887
Here's the banner.

634
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,015
Hold that up.

635
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,725
Rows of two?

636
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:14,769
Okay, behind.

637
00:55:14,853 --> 00:55:16,187
Don't push in the back.

638
00:55:16,271 --> 00:55:18,982
You'll be gone for good
if you fall, got it?

639
00:55:19,607 --> 00:55:20,442
Now.

640
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:22,610
Okay, that's good. Gather together.

641
00:55:26,698 --> 00:55:28,241
Get closer.

642
00:55:28,324 --> 00:55:30,410
-Closer.
-Okay, that's good.

643
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:31,453
Look at that.

644
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:33,872
Isn't that Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon?

645
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:36,207
-That's right.
-It is him!

646
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:38,418
-Let us take a photo.
-You're so handsome!

647
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,378
Just a moment.

648
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:42,756
-Can we take a photo with you?
-After ours.

649
00:55:42,839 --> 00:55:44,382
Wait a moment.

650
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:47,218
Just a moment. Please, don't push.

651
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,762
Please maintain order.

652
00:55:49,345 --> 00:55:50,221
Just a moment.

653
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,182
Mr. Park.

654
00:55:52,265 --> 00:55:55,185
People, please don't push. Maintain order.

655
00:55:56,144 --> 00:55:56,978
Mr. Park! Mr. Paik!

656
00:56:04,069 --> 00:56:04,986
Excuse me!

657
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:07,530
Oh, no!

658
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,365
-What do we do?
-What is it?

659
00:56:09,449 --> 00:56:11,201
A person fell.

660
00:56:11,868 --> 00:56:13,369
-Who?
-Hong Hee-joo.

661
00:56:13,453 --> 00:56:15,663
It happened in the blink of an eye.
Down the cliff.

662
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:17,874
Step back. Please, step back.

663
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:18,875
Hong Hee-joo.

664
00:56:19,584 --> 00:56:21,252
Hong Hee-joo!

665
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,820
We were just about to take a group photo,

666
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:49,155
and some hikers approached us.

667
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,533
They barged in and started pushing.

668
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,368
First, deploy the rescue team.

669
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,329
It's almost 6 p.m.
It'll be bad if it gets dark.

670
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,330
Mr. Paik!

671
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,176
How did he come from there?

672
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,095
He went down before you got here.

673
00:57:12,178 --> 00:57:14,264
-Down there?
-Are you okay? Were you hurt?

674
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:16,516
How could you go down there like that?

675
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,601
I saw a broken tree.

676
00:57:19,269 --> 00:57:21,563
I think she hit that on her way down.

677
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:23,648
Can we deploy the rescue dogs right away?

678
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,693
Yes, but we don't have
the missing person's belongings.

679
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:31,114
They can smell this.

680
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,575
She has my jacket around her waist. Hurry.

681
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:37,078
Did you get through?

682
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,246
No, I can't get through.

683
00:57:44,669 --> 00:57:45,753
HONG HEE-JOO

684
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:52,051
The number you have dialed is…

685
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:58,391
The number you have dialed is…

686
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:18,012
Mr. Paik. Over here.

687
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:22,141
People, please don't push. Maintain order.

688
00:59:26,312 --> 00:59:27,188
Someone…

689
01:00:30,585 --> 01:00:31,544
Sis?

690
01:00:32,337 --> 01:00:35,089
Do you know what kind of phone this is?

691
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,341
This…

692
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,177
can only call Paik Sa-eon.

693
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,678
That was really true?

694
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,349
Why is he so meticulous?

695
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:50,897
Hong Hee-joo!

696
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:56,569
Hong Hee-joo!

697
01:00:58,696 --> 01:00:59,697
PARK DO-JAE

698
01:01:01,157 --> 01:01:03,660
-What happened?
-They're still searching.

699
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:07,580
They're searching up to 300 meters
downstream of the cliff, but…

700
01:01:08,414 --> 01:01:09,499
NBN KANG TAE-KYEONG

701
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:14,045
Reporters keep calling me.
Has it already spread to the media?

702
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:16,714
I'll regulate it.
And I'll expand the search radius.

703
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:18,758
What about the security footage?

704
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,719
The police are checking the footage
near the trail and summit.

705
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:25,098
Our team members and people,
who were nearby when it happened,

706
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,892
-are being questioned as witnesses.
-If you find anything,

707
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,143
call me right away.

708
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,775
CHUGYEONG DAILY NEWS PARK GUK-JIN

709
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:40,154
Are you going to get that?

710
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:42,198
No, I'm not.

711
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:47,286
Because there's a call I'm waiting for.

712
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,806
Are they conducting a search?

713
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:10,268
Why don't I hear anything?

714
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:15,565
Shouldn't there be helicopters
and drones looking for me?

715
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,660
Is this how I'll get caught?

716
01:02:30,121 --> 01:02:31,372
I'm being punished.

717
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,834
I should've confessed earlier.

718
01:02:36,627 --> 01:02:39,464
Yeah, it's for the best.

719
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,632
I'll finally say it to him now.

720
01:02:44,051 --> 01:02:45,052
Yeah.

721
01:02:46,053 --> 01:02:46,971
Yeah.

722
01:02:48,639 --> 01:02:50,308
He might not pick up.

723
01:02:50,391 --> 01:02:51,559
No.

724
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:55,313
It's over if he doesn't.
I need to snap out of it!

725
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:56,814
Get it together.

726
01:03:05,114 --> 01:03:10,077
PAIK SA-EON

727
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,580
Pick up. No. Don't pick up.

728
01:03:13,748 --> 01:03:15,082
Pick up, please.

729
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:21,714
Hong Hee-joo!

730
01:03:24,258 --> 01:03:25,510
Hong Hee-joo!

731
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:29,180
Hong Hee-joo!

732
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:37,939
Hee-joo.

733
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,525
I mean…

734
01:03:41,484 --> 01:03:42,485
406.

735
01:03:43,277 --> 01:03:44,195
What about Hee-joo?

736
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:46,739
How is she?

737
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:50,785
Does he think we're together?

738
01:03:50,868 --> 01:03:53,371
406, can you hear me?

739
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,126
You said to call when there's a corpse.

740
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,714
That's why I called.

741
01:04:04,715 --> 01:04:05,883
Come take her.

742
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:10,137
That's good.

743
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:13,182
Thank you for calling me.

744
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:16,811
Where did Hee-joo fall?

745
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:18,855
Just tell me the location.

746
01:04:31,242 --> 01:04:32,535
I don't know.

747
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:33,536
406!

748
01:04:34,370 --> 01:04:35,663
Listen to me carefully.

749
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:39,166
I've put a first-aid kit
inside of Hee-joo's backpack.

750
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:41,794
At the bottom of the kit,
there's a portable flare.

751
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:44,171
You can ignite it by striking the top lid.

752
01:04:44,255 --> 01:04:46,299
I hope Hee-joo finds it and uses it.

753
01:04:47,758 --> 01:04:49,427
What do you think, 406?

754
01:04:50,177 --> 01:04:51,304
If Hee-joo wakes up,

755
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:54,807
wouldn't she try to search for something?

756
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:09,947
Are you scared?

757
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:11,032
Me?

758
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,660
What's there to be scared of?

759
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:16,913
I'm…

760
01:05:20,207 --> 01:05:22,126
scared to death right now.

761
01:05:22,209 --> 01:05:24,003
PAIK SA-EON

762
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:57,703
406!

763
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,289
Are you there?

764
01:06:00,373 --> 01:06:01,374
Answer me!

765
01:06:02,458 --> 01:06:03,459
I can hear you.

766
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:12,510
The temperature has dropped.

767
01:06:13,594 --> 01:06:16,347
Do you think Hee-joo's cold?

768
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,892
I don't know if she's wearing my jacket.

769
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,520
There's water in her backpack too.

770
01:06:22,603 --> 01:06:24,438
She can't get dehydrated.

771
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:27,733
She needs to drink water.

772
01:06:37,576 --> 01:06:38,828
You did it.

773
01:06:39,578 --> 01:06:40,579
I can see it.

774
01:06:45,418 --> 01:06:47,169
Come quickly.

775
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,171
I'm on my way. Don't hang up!

776
01:06:49,255 --> 01:06:51,173
And if you can,

777
01:06:51,757 --> 01:06:53,259
please tell Hee-joo

778
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:54,552
not to worry.

779
01:06:55,344 --> 01:06:57,972
Tell her I'll be right there!

780
01:07:15,448 --> 01:07:18,367
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

781
01:07:22,705 --> 01:07:23,622
Tell me.

782
01:07:24,665 --> 01:07:27,334
I'll say it once,
so listen carefully, 406.

783
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,920
My true feelings for Hee-joo…

784
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,423
What are your true feelings?

785
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,508
Tell me.

786
01:07:40,139 --> 01:07:41,307
I can't hear you.

787
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,687
Hong Hee-joo.

788
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:49,774
I like you.

789
01:08:55,923 --> 01:08:58,843
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

790
01:08:58,926 --> 01:09:01,178
Starting now, I want you
to answer my questions.

791
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:03,097
The most important question.

792
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:04,098
Did you see his face?

793
01:09:04,181 --> 01:09:05,224
I like it.

794
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,351
I like feeling your heartbeat.

795
01:09:07,852 --> 01:09:10,187
Is he taking a shower? Why?

796
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,939
We've already slept together.

797
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:13,232
Is this real?

798
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:14,775
I felt regretful.

799
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:17,153
I don't think I've done enough for you.

800
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:18,362
No, I mean just me!

801
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,531
You should return my phone.

802
01:09:20,614 --> 01:09:21,907
I'm on my way. Open the door.

803
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,415
