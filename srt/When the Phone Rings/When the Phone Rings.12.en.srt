1
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,963
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,106
No.

3
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,024
Get him!

4
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,320
No.

5
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,172
No…

6
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,757
Oh, no…

7
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,091
What do I do?

8
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,336
Hello?

9
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:10,964
What?

10
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,924
From the Barun Cultural Foundation…

11
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:14,300
You didn't know either?

12
00:02:14,384 --> 00:02:15,552
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

13
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,011
Where's it being held?

14
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:18,263
I'm on my way now.

15
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:21,057
No, don't come here.
There are a lot of reporters here.

16
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,351
What's important is that he's not here.

17
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:30,233
Former Presidential Spokesperson
Paik Sa-eon announced

18
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:33,444
he'd donate all the assets he inherited
from the late Chairman Paik Jang-ho

19
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:34,737
to society this morning.

20
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,824
<i>And that all legal procedures</i>

21
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:40,869
<i>will only be carried out</i>
<i>through his legal representative.</i>

22
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,956
Meanwhile, the Presidential Office
has accepted Paik's resignation

23
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,375
<i>and is seeking a replacement.</i>

24
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:08,229
LETTER OF APPOINTMENT

25
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:09,147
<i>He…</i>

26
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
<i>disappeared.</i>

27
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,155
FINAL EPISODE

28
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,288
Let's eat!

29
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,291
Hurry and take a seat.

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:29,792
Be careful.

31
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,546
That's nice.

32
00:03:34,297 --> 00:03:35,381
Eat up.

33
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,925
Is it okay to eat more?

34
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:37,967
Of course.

35
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:39,719
You have to eat to grow.

36
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:42,263
I'm going to be taller than Sang-woo!

37
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,806
I'll be cooler too.

38
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,935
So, you can't marry Sang-woo, okay?

39
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,102
- "Marry"?
- Here.

40
00:03:49,562 --> 00:03:50,772
Don't grow up so fast.

41
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,607
Being cute is the best.

42
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,836
Why compete with a kid?

43
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:16,381
Compete…

44
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,174
Whatever.

45
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,055
Have you heard?

46
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,433
Paik Sa-eon donated all his assets.

47
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:29,269
I heard.

48
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,896
How could I not know? It was huge.

49
00:04:33,022 --> 00:04:34,649
The director here said

50
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,860
the Nuri Dream Center
is also getting a donation.

51
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:38,903
From Sa-eon?

52
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:40,989
It's from an anonymous donor.

53
00:04:41,823 --> 00:04:42,949
Who else could it be?

54
00:04:46,327 --> 00:04:48,121
He donated his assets,

55
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:50,081
resigned as spokesperson,

56
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,499
and is unreachable.

57
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,042
No one knows where he is.

58
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,545
It feels like Paik Sa-eon

59
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,632
has completely disappeared from the world.

60
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:00,633
He has.

61
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:04,971
Paik Sa-eon's dead.

62
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,935
That's right.

63
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,520
He died.

64
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:20,570
Breaking news.

65
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:24,073
It has been confirmed that Hong Hee-joo,
the wife of Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon…

66
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,991
1 MONTH AGO

67
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,617
…has safely returned to her family

68
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:29,120
after being missing for four days.

69
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,373
<i>Police have charged Shim Kyu-jin,</i>

70
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,376
<i>the wife of Liberty and Justice Party</i>
<i>candidate Paik Ui-yong,</i>

71
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,422
<i>with kidnapping and inciting murder</i>
<i>in connection with Hong Hee-joo's case.</i>

72
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,007
Min was also taken into custody

73
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:43,593
and is being investigated
for carrying out the crime.

74
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:47,388
<i>Min confessed that he was instructed</i>
<i>to push the vehicle into the river</i>

75
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:48,765
<i>to stage a fall</i>

76
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:53,019
<i>and to scatter Hong Hee-joo's belongings,</i>
<i>such as her shoes and cell phone,</i>

77
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,438
<i>to obstruct the police investigation.</i>

78
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,857
Meanwhile, the suspect
who kidnapped Hong Hee-joo

79
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:02,320
repeatedly threatened the victim
with a firearm despite repeated warnings

80
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,157
<i>and ultimately was shot to death</i>
<i>by the police at the scene.</i>

81
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,006
<i>Mom!</i>

82
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,680
Mom!

83
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,899
You're there, aren't you?

84
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,778
I know you're out there!

85
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:48,866
Why did you lock me in here?

86
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,168
How long will you keep me locked up?

87
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:01,170
I told you.

88
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,047
Son, I…

89
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,551
I never want to lose you again.

90
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,556
I regretted it so much.

91
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:14,016
If only

92
00:07:14,892 --> 00:07:16,394
I had protected you back then,

93
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:19,689
I wouldn't have lost you like that.

94
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:26,612
Sa-eon,

95
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,865
listen to me carefully.

96
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,825
Listen.

97
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:33,786
I'm not locking you up,

98
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,498
I'm protecting you.

99
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,199
KIDNAPPING SUSPECT SHOT TO DEATH

100
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:12,718
All this time,

101
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,974
I've always believed
that I lived a luckier life than others.

102
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,476
With a prestigious political family

103
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,980
and a father respected…

104
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,149
by the entire nation.

105
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:38,953
But it was all a lie.

106
00:09:40,204 --> 00:09:41,455
The truth about my father

107
00:09:42,373 --> 00:09:44,959
was the complete opposite
of what I had believed.

108
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,252
It was an illusion.

109
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:50,214
The son I had thought to be dead returned

110
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:52,675
and made it more miserable.

111
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:58,472
So, I am leaving behind
my family and background,

112
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:03,060
and I will stand again as Paik Ui-yong,
an ordinary man.

113
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,938
Honorable citizens,

114
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,775
if you can generously embrace…

115
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,696
my shortcomings and mistakes,

116
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,156
I, Paik Ui-yong,

117
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,076
promise to be reborn…

118
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:23,289
as a better version of myself for you.

119
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,925
<i>Paik Ui-yong came in third</i>
<i>with 3.4% of the vote.</i>

120
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,468
<i>In the end,</i>

121
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:02,096
<i>the Paik family</i>
<i>never produced a president.</i>

122
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,766
The defendant murdered her father-in-law

123
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,687
and, showing no signs of remorse,
once again incited murder,

124
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:14,400
ultimately repeating a crime
that led to casualties.

125
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,484
JUDGE

126
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,612
This court holds the defendant
accountable for this,

127
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,948
and sentences Shim Kyu-jin

128
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:23,409
to life in prison.

129
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:35,045
<i>In the end, the mother,</i>
<i>who failed twice to protect her son,</i>

130
00:12:35,671 --> 00:12:36,839
<i>appealed.</i>

131
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:43,220
<i>She asked for the maximum sentence,</i>
<i>the death penalty.</i>

132
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:54,190
<i>The butler, who had been loyal</i>
<i>to the Paik family his whole life,</i>

133
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,942
<i>acknowledged his crime</i>
<i>and showed deep remorse.</i>

134
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:00,070
<i>Considering that the victim</i>
<i>did not wish to punish him,</i>

135
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,073
<i>he was sentenced to five years in prison.</i>

136
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:12,041
<i>The Paik family's scandal,</i>
<i>which had caused such an uproar,</i>

137
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,835
<i>came to an end.</i>

138
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,481
<i>As for him,</i>

139
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,150
<i>he disappeared from the world,</i>

140
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,820
<i>letting go of everything he had.</i>

141
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,376
You're back.

142
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,212
Have you been well?

143
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,510
Why do you keep coming here?

144
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,221
You know very well…

145
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,849
that I betrayed the spokesperson.

146
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,644
Before he realized your betrayal,

147
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,815
he called you the most

148
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,944
and talked to you the most.

149
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:26,115
Yes, he did.

150
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:27,783
Anything is fine.

151
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:32,288
Does anything from your conversations
with him come to mind? Anything.

152
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,875
Please, tell me.

153
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,212
He said…

154
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,257
he'd disappear like dust.

155
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,801
Once the revenge was over

156
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,971
and with everything
that had driven his life,

157
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,808
his goals and targets, gone,

158
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,478
he said he would self-destruct.

159
00:14:58,355 --> 00:14:59,273
Originally.

160
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,944
"Originally"?

161
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,572
Yes, but…

162
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,407
What about now?

163
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,910
Did you change your mind?

164
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:12,953
Of course.

165
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,124
I'm going to live a life
after taking revenge.

166
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,293
With the person

167
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,213
I want to be with for the rest of my life.

168
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:30,429
So I don't think he disappeared
just because the revenge was over.

169
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:32,932
I'm sure…

170
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,435
there's another reason.

171
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,699
- Hee-joo.
- Mr. Kang.

172
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:53,535
How long has it been?

173
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,703
Have you been well…

174
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:01,710
It's been a while.

175
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,589
Are you here to see Mr. Park?

176
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,050
Yeah, I come by often.

177
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,762
It frustrates me
when I think of the spokesperson,

178
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:15,724
but I was taught to hate sin
and not people.

179
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:19,979
See you later.

180
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:23,691
He used to ask me quite often.

181
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:30,364
He asked what married couples talk about
and how they show affection.

182
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:35,869
And how to be a good husband.

183
00:16:35,953 --> 00:16:37,287
In your marriage,

184
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:40,082
do you hide anything

185
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,376
or deceive each other?

186
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,588
Sometimes it's necessary to pretend
not to know and let things slide.

187
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,758
Marriage takes effort, don't you think?

188
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,719
Effort?

189
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:54,430
How do you do that?

190
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,432
- Excuse me?
- "I love you,

191
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,434
ultimate love in the universe."

192
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,145
He may have been clumsy,

193
00:17:02,813 --> 00:17:04,356
but he tried really hard.

194
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,157
I want to hear more.

195
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,754
The spokesperson…

196
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,007
learned how to do this.

197
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,217
Can you believe it?

198
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,428
We were going to the retreat.

199
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,724
On the bus,
he asked me how to show affection.

200
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,101
So I taught him this.

201
00:17:41,935 --> 00:17:42,936
But I guess…

202
00:17:43,937 --> 00:17:45,439
that was all for you.

203
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,525
I never imagined that.

204
00:17:49,109 --> 00:17:50,194
I miss him too.

205
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,790
How handsome. It looks great on you.

206
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,794
Dad, do you remember?

207
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:10,923
When I was little,
you bought me <i>tonkatsu</i> every Christmas.

208
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:13,008
<i>Tonkatsu</i> is yummy.

209
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:19,723
I ate all sorts of delicious food
every Christmas at Chairman Hong's house,

210
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,102
but the <i>tonkatsu</i> we shared together
was the best.

211
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,813
I like <i>tonkatsu.</i>
That's why I asked to come here.

212
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,649
It was my idea to come here.

213
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,484
Your food's ready.

214
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:31,902
Thank you.

215
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:37,991
You're back again.

216
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,701
Enjoy your meal.

217
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:51,547
It's good.

218
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,465
- But, Dad?
- Yeah.

219
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,883
Have you been here before?

220
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,510
On my birthday.

221
00:18:56,593 --> 00:18:57,886
I asked to come here.

222
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:00,180
Asked who?

223
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,182
My son-in-law.

224
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:08,438
What?

225
00:20:03,702 --> 00:20:07,247
When was that?
If it was your birthday, was it July?

226
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:13,295
Has he come back since? Have you seen him?

227
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,255
Let's go.

228
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,558
It's almost Christmas.

229
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,229
Don't stay alone in an empty house.

230
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:14,147
Come with me.

231
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,695
If you don't want to see Mom and Dad,
let's go on a trip.

232
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,990
How long are you going to stay here?

233
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,535
How many times do I have to tell you?

234
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,870
I'm not leaving this house.

235
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,414
You'll keep waiting here?

236
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,292
It's been six months already.

237
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:36,878
What if I leave this house,

238
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:39,172
and he comes back?

239
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:41,675
What if he comes,

240
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,679
but I'm not here, and we miss each other?

241
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,849
In-a…

242
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,313
I still can't believe he's gone.

243
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,900
After I was rescued
and woke up in the hospital, I'm sure…

244
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,738
he was right next to me.

245
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:13,623
<i>When I slept for days from exhaustion,</i>

246
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,380
<i>every time I woke up,</i>

247
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,050
<i>he was right next to me,</i>

248
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,803
<i>as if he'd always be there.</i>

249
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:43,570
<i>And…</i>

250
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:47,574
<i>on the last night I could remember…</i>

251
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,575
Hee-joo.

252
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,494
Hee-joo.

253
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:58,835
It's okay.

254
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:01,004
It was just a dream, okay?

255
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:04,299
I'm so relieved.

256
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:10,847
I had a dream that you got shot.

257
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,476
No.

258
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,603
I'm right here.

259
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,314
So go back to sleep.

260
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:46,216
<i>I still remember his warm touch</i>
<i>that lulled me to sleep so vividly.</i>

261
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:50,428
I feel like he'll come right back.
How could I leave this house?

262
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:51,763
He's not coming back.

263
00:23:52,347 --> 00:23:53,223
What?

264
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,934
I thought you'd give up and move on
after some time.

265
00:23:56,768 --> 00:23:57,602
But how is it…

266
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,022
that you can't forget, not for a moment?

267
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,443
Do you know?

268
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,989
Do you know why he left
and isn't coming back?

269
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:10,615
Do you know the reason?

270
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,452
This is the only thing I can tell you.

271
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,205
Forget him.

272
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:18,957
He…

273
00:24:20,792 --> 00:24:21,960
will never come back.

274
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,171
So why?

275
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,799
Why would you say that?

276
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:29,676
In-a, tell me.

277
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,261
Please.

278
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:35,682
Hee-joo.

279
00:24:38,101 --> 00:24:40,145
No matter what I say,
I know you won't listen.

280
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:46,193
But now, I just want you
to hurt less and be happier.

281
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:48,111
No.

282
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,749
I can only hurt less and be happier

283
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,084
if he's here.

284
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,382
I need him so badly.

285
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:13,470
I miss him so much.

00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,538
Two billion won.

317
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,583
Two <i>billion</i> won?

318
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,630
Wait, were you that loaded?

319
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,257
It wasn't me.

320
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,926
I don't have that kind of money.

321
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:04,469
Then who…

322
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,223
Didn't you work as a war correspondent
in Argan with him?

323
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:11,601
Do you know of any places
he might be in Argan?

324
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:13,394
What are you talking about?

325
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,605
Paik Sa-eon!

326
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,819
Are you saying he did this?

327
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,195
Who else would do this?

328
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,489
The call from Argan,

329
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,575
the amount of two billion won,
406, and 604…

330
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,619
Is this just a coincidence?

331
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,168
I don't know what you're saying.

332
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,921
So, what if I know some places in Argan?
Will you go--

333
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,756
If you have any ideas, tell me.

334
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:43,967
Come on, Hee-joo.

335
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,886
Don't you know Argan's a war zone?

336
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,514
Not only is it restricted
to certain people,

337
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,724
but you'll die if you go!

338
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:54,352
It doesn't matter if I die here
waiting for him

339
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,979
or get shot over there.

340
00:30:56,062 --> 00:30:57,605
It's all the same to me.

341
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,441
So, please tell me.

342
00:31:01,651 --> 00:31:03,319
I'm not leaving before you tell me.

Sunset?

Haven't you seen his phone's lock screen?

346
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,467
He's crazy about them.

347
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,053
He's obsessed with sunsets.

348
00:31:30,847 --> 00:31:31,931
<i>When we were in Argan,</i>

349
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,559
<i>he'd rush over at sundown.</i>

350
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:37,896
<i>There's an incredible spot</i>
<i>to watch the sunset.</i>

351
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:43,568
<i>He'd take photo after photo</i>
<i>of the sunset sky there.</i>

352
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,748
It's red, like your swollen cheek.

Because of you…

358
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,399
do you know how many times
my plans have changed?

359
00:38:41,277 --> 00:38:42,403
No, from the start,

360
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,865
if you were involved,
none of my plans worked.

361
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,869
It all just falls apart.

362
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,040
Let it fall apart.

363
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:57,293
I'll ruin everything.

364
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:02,298
You're always going on about plans!

365
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:03,883
So?

366
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,761
Did anything in our relationship
go according to plan?

367
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,680
It didn't for me.

368
00:39:10,264 --> 00:39:12,391
Divorcing you was my plan.

369
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,226
You know what happened.

370
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,187
I couldn't divorce you,

371
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:20,274
I couldn't escape you,

372
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,319
and now I can't live a single day
without you.

373
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:26,280
So I traveled halfway around the world
to come here!

374
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,531
Are you dumb?

375
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,284
How could you say
you can't live without me?

376
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,285
How…

377
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,996
can you say that when you know everything?

378
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,375
About what?

379
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:43,506
This is the only thing I can tell you.

380
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:44,673
He…

381
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,468
will never come back.

382
00:39:48,344 --> 00:39:49,762
Did my sister say something?

383
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,100
No. Before that…

384
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,909
<i>What did you find out that day?</i>

385
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,038
<i>Why did you look at me like that?</i>

386
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:19,583
Answer me! What did he tell you?

387
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:23,379
<i>Did you know?</i>

388
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,090
Your father, Paik Jang-ho,

389
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,260
killed Hong Hee-joo's little brother.

390
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:31,303
Yeah.

391
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,097
That car accident.

392
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,933
Paik Jang-ho put out a hit

393
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,686
and ran them over with a truck.

394
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:48,696
Paik Jang-ho tried so hard
to hide me from the world,

395
00:40:49,822 --> 00:40:51,615
but her little brother saw me.

396
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,915
<i>From the blood running in my veins</i>
<i>to my name,</i>

397
00:41:02,001 --> 00:41:03,711
<i>the only thing I ever did right</i>

398
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,298
<i>in this sinful life of mine</i>

399
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:10,384
<i>was protect you, Hee-joo.</i>

400
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,599
THE LATE HONG YU-JIN

401
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,352
<i>But it turned out</i>

402
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,855
<i>I didn't protect you.</i>

403
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,399
<i>Instead, I took so much from you.</i>

404
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:28,110
<i>Your brother,</i>

405
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,446
<i>your youth,</i>

406
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,198
<i>your dreams.</i>

407
00:41:34,283 --> 00:41:37,161
<i>My father was the one</i>
<i>who crushed them all.</i>

408
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:50,382
Did you…

409
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,427
finally figure it out?

410
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:56,680
What about Hee-joo?

411
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:02,561
She knows everything.

412
00:42:04,813 --> 00:42:09,276
She knew everything,
yet she still risked her life for you.

413
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:36,929
Is that why you left me?
Because you felt bad?

414
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,014
I didn't leave you.

415
00:42:42,601 --> 00:42:44,520
I needed time to punish myself.

416
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,066
I was looking for an excuse.

417
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,407
<i>Since you already knew everything</i>

418
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,701
<i>and said it didn't matter,</i>

419
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:01,954
<i>I kept rationalizing it.</i>

420
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,540
<i>I thought I could just stay here,</i>

421
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:09,587
<i>pretending not to know,</i>

422
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:12,881
<i>and make you happy from now on.</i>

423
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,679
<i>When did it even start</i>
<i>that I can't live without you?</i>

424
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,807
My goal was just…

425
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:24,310
to set you free.

426
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,027
And I felt…

427
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:37,114
so disgusted with myself for it.

428
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,411
So I wanted to punish myself,

429
00:43:43,787 --> 00:43:45,831
until I could forgive myself.

430
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,835
How much longer do I have to wait?

431
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:53,464
You know it too.

432
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,845
We spent more time
misunderstanding and drifting apart

433
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:04,141
than cherishing and loving each other.

434
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,019
But if I still have to wait,

435
00:44:10,439 --> 00:44:12,358
how much longer will it take?

436
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:17,696
If you have to be punished,
I should be the one to punish you!

437
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,576
You're punishing me now.

438
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,372
You're right in front of me,

439
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,627
and I want to hold you like crazy.

440
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:34,880
Can't you see I'm holding back?

441
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,554
I won't hold back anymore.

442
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:30,430
It was true.

443
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,606
We lived together for three years,

444
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,110
but I didn't know
because I never checked your phone.

445
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:46,613
They're all sunsets.

446
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,533
It was filled with you.

447
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,210
Is that why you came to Argan?

448
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:05,090
It was far from you,

449
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,761
but it was where I could see you.

450
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:14,725
But I never thought

451
00:48:16,351 --> 00:48:18,895
I'd see you here like this.

452
00:48:20,397 --> 00:48:21,732
604.

453
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:25,402
You called me from that number, right?

454
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:30,032
That day,

455
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,451
I had a dream.

456
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,788
You were crying a lot in the dream.

457
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:42,085
So…

458
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,964
Actually, that was just an excuse.

459
00:48:46,048 --> 00:48:48,383
I just wanted to hear your voice.

460
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,804
That being said,

461
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:57,017
I didn't expect you
to just show up like this.

462
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:04,650
Why did you make a donation
to the sign language school in my name?

463
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,027
I donated two billion won.

464
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:09,696
Does that remind you of something?

465
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:13,575
Two billion won.

466
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:17,871
One, the groom cannot initiate a divorce.

467
00:49:17,954 --> 00:49:21,333
Two, divorce is prohibited
under any circumstances.

468
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,169
Three, we will actively announce
to the public

469
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:26,088
that we are a married couple.

470
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,090
If any of these are violated,

471
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,967
the penalty will be two billion won.

472
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,804
That's right.

473
00:49:34,554 --> 00:49:36,014
It's my settlement to you.

474
00:49:40,519 --> 00:49:42,104
Because I'm going to break

475
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:45,482
our wedding vows.

476
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,820
Paik Sa-eon…

477
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:54,074
will divorce Hong Hee-joo.

478
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:57,119
What?

479
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,579
And I, not Paik Sa-eon…

480
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:06,420
will marry you.

481
00:51:10,108 --> 00:51:12,402
- Do you want to switch spots?
- What? Why?

482
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:16,740
Well, the spokesperson
will come out when this door opens.

483
00:51:16,823 --> 00:51:20,994
I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed and nervous.

484
00:51:21,077 --> 00:51:22,996
- Will you switch spots with me?
- Nope.

485
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,498
This isn't the Presidential Office.

486
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,167
He's not the spokesperson anymore.
Don't be nervous.

487
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:29,085
Right?

488
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,295
Right…

489
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:33,882
Hello.

490
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,091
For you.

491
00:51:35,175 --> 00:51:36,009
Get in here.

492
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:38,804
I'm starving.

493
00:51:38,887 --> 00:51:41,223
- Wow!
- Look at that.

494
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:44,559
Goodness.

495
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,731
The food keeps coming.

496
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,400
Hee-joo, did you make all of this?

497
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:56,029
- Amazing. Everything tastes delicious.
- Yes.

498
00:51:56,112 --> 00:51:57,864
- I made it.
- What?

499
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,158
- You did?
- You?

500
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:03,787
Are you saying you won't let your wife
lift a finger from now on?

501
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,372
I've taught you well.

502
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,918
It's not that.

503
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:12,045
She's not very good at cook--

504
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:15,799
Oh, my.

505
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:17,884
Your ring is so pretty.

506
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:19,386
Give me your hand.

507
00:52:20,345 --> 00:52:21,805
Look at that.

508
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:24,349
Your ring is beautiful.

509
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:27,269
But I just don't get it.

510
00:52:27,352 --> 00:52:30,272
Why get married twice,
especially to the same person?

511
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,107
I know.

512
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,108
However,

513
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,734
I approve of this marriage.

514
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,029
Congratulations! The fruit of true love.

515
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,197
Thank you.

516
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,409
By the way, is it true?

517
00:52:42,492 --> 00:52:44,327
- Did you change your name?
- You did?

518
00:52:45,036 --> 00:52:46,121
To what?

519
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,581
Well…

520
00:52:50,166 --> 00:52:52,002
Paik Yu-yeon.

521
00:52:52,085 --> 00:52:54,004
Paik Yu-yeon?

522
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,756
What does it mean?

523
00:52:58,466 --> 00:53:00,302
Yu is for "only."

524
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:01,803
Yeon is for "love."

525
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:08,018
A one and only love in the world?

526
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:10,520
Oh, my.

527
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,315
Hey. Are these your true colors?

528
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,280
Why are you looking at me like that?

529
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:23,658
Congratulations on becoming
the most romantic husband.

530
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:28,872
So, tell us, when will you return
to the Presidential Office?

531
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:31,499
I won't be returning there.

532
00:53:32,208 --> 00:53:33,877
Then what will you do?

533
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:42,135
Anyway, even though
it's hard to get used to,

534
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:44,638
let's celebrate Paik Yu-yeon

535
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:47,557
and Hong Hee-joo's marriage.

536
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:48,600
Shall we all toast?

537
00:53:48,683 --> 00:53:50,644
- Congratulations!
- Congrats.

538
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:51,770
Thank you.

539
00:53:52,938 --> 00:53:53,939
While we're at it,

540
00:53:55,065 --> 00:53:56,399
will you congratulate us too?

541
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:58,026
To tell you the truth…

542
00:53:59,027 --> 00:53:59,945
We're also…

543
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:02,364
getting married!

544
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:05,825
- Wow!
- Seriously?

545
00:54:06,993 --> 00:54:08,453
Na You-ri!

546
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,705
Congratulations, You-ri!

547
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:11,623
Sang-woo!

548
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,874
Thank you.

549
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,126
I had no idea.

550
00:54:15,627 --> 00:54:16,628
Congratulations.

551
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:18,463
Congrats.

552
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:19,673
Congratulations.

553
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,424
You two look great together.

554
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,842
Let's toast!

555
00:54:23,677 --> 00:54:25,595
- Congratulations!
- Yeah, congrats!

556
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,807
Being married is nice, right?

557
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:29,724
What?

558
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,560
Of course, it is.

559
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,520
Right?

560
00:54:33,603 --> 00:54:35,230
Of course. You-ri, it's good.

561
00:54:39,192 --> 00:54:40,068
What are you doing?

562
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:42,988
Hey!

563
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,318
Are you tired?

564
00:55:24,821 --> 00:55:27,323
You said you did all the cooking.

565
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,409
But it's true.

566
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,042
Great job.

567
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,085
The lively atmosphere was nice.

568
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:44,841
I hope this house stays lively
and never quiet.

569
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,509
Really?

570
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:50,430
Then, we need someone other than us here.

571
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:54,434
I start work at the broadcast station
next week.

572
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,019
- The station?
- Yeah.

573
00:55:56,102 --> 00:55:59,022
I've agreed to be
their sign language interpreter again.

574
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,649
And I'm going to continue doing it.

575
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,359
I like this job.

576
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:05,904
Sure. Congrats.

577
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,577
Cooperate, Hong Hee-joo.

578
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,121
If you want this house to be lively,

579
00:56:15,663 --> 00:56:17,165
we need more family members!

580
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,292
What are you doing?

581
00:56:19,375 --> 00:56:20,877
Cooperate!

582
00:56:26,382 --> 00:56:27,801

583
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,538
Try it.

584
00:56:57,122 --> 00:56:59,165
It's your favorite.

585
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:02,127
Since that day,

586
00:57:03,878 --> 00:57:05,630
I just can't eat fish anymore.

587
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,924
When I smell the fishy odor,

588
00:57:09,509 --> 00:57:11,511
it brings back memories
of the fishing spot.

589
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,848
Help…

590
00:57:19,644 --> 00:57:20,478
Help…

591
00:57:25,608 --> 00:57:27,152
I'll make you something else.

592
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,069
No.

593
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:29,487
It's fine.

594
00:57:45,670 --> 00:57:47,630
You're as good as ever.

595
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:50,091
Thanks.

596
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,559
Try the white kimchi.

<i>Marriage registration?</i>

598
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:05,273
I'll come back with him soon.

599
00:58:06,024 --> 00:58:07,108
He wanted to come today,

600
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:10,403
but I didn't think
you'd say anything nice to him.

601
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:12,363
You're right.

602
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:16,284
You said you'd choose your own fate
and even went into that war zone.

603
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,161
And you married him without telling us.

604
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:19,078
Unbelievable.

605
00:58:20,246 --> 00:58:21,748
You said you never saw her smile.

606
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,834
She's smiling now.

607
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:26,878
She looks happy.

608
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,632
What else could we ask for?

609
00:58:33,593 --> 00:58:35,762
Where do you live?

610
00:58:35,845 --> 00:58:37,639
The neighborhood's far from here.

611
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,225
Where is it?

612
00:58:41,893 --> 00:58:43,394
Let's take it slow, Mom.

613
00:58:43,478 --> 00:58:45,104
I'll visit from time to time.

614
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:58,535
Be happy.

615
00:59:01,204 --> 00:59:03,581
I know how much he cares for you.

616
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,209
So live a long…

617
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,628
and happy life.

618
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:24,978
Hee-joo.

619
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:32,485
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about the marriage.

620
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:33,403
But…

621
00:59:35,905 --> 00:59:37,865
I didn't know how you'd feel.

622
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:39,492
I'm not trying to congratulate you.

623
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,245
Since we reunited,

624
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:47,125
I've been trying my best
to get closer to you.

625
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:49,043
But…

626
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:51,629
it was so hard.

627
00:59:54,299 --> 00:59:55,633
But when I think about it,

628
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,177
I don't think I did it right.

629
00:59:59,095 --> 01:00:00,680
Before we could get close,

630
01:00:02,056 --> 01:00:03,850
I should've said this to you first.

631
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,271
Hee-joo,

632
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,231
I'm sorry.

633
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:12,150
I…

634
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:16,404
made you suffer for a long time,

635
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,656
both as the perpetrator

636
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,159
and the bystander.

637
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:25,955
In-a.

638
01:00:27,665 --> 01:00:29,626
I'm going to forget everything
from the past.

639
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,795
If I keep dwelling on the past,

640
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:37,425
I'll be unhappy in the present.

641
01:00:38,676 --> 01:00:39,844
You should try it too.

642
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,055
Forget the past.

643
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:44,807
Would that be okay?

644
01:00:49,854 --> 01:00:50,855
In-a.

645
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:53,650
I'm happy.

646
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,526
And now,

647
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:58,363
I don't doubt my happiness anymore.

648
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,993
Because I'm someone who truly deserves it,

649
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:06,996
and he helped me believe that.

650
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:10,500
You deserve to be happy too.

651
01:01:11,876 --> 01:01:13,044
Believe me.

652
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:19,467
<i>Breaking news.</i>

653
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:22,428
The ongoing Paltima airstrikes
are taking place in Izmael,

654
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:25,598
where Korean nationals have been kidnapped
by armed militants.

655
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:30,603
In response, the government has set up
a Protection Headquarters

656
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,399
at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and will send negotiator Paik Yu-yeon.

657
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:38,027
The government will prioritize
the safety of the hostages

658
01:01:38,111 --> 01:01:43,074
and make every diplomatic effort
to rescue every one of them.

659
01:01:43,991 --> 01:01:45,618

HUSBAND

662
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:24,240
Hello?

663
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,992
<i>What took you so long to pick up?</i>

664
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:27,493
Where are you? Are you okay?

665
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,662
The negotiations are over.

666
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:31,164
I'm coming home.

667
01:02:39,046 --> 01:02:41,090
We're ready for departure.

668
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,470
I've been waiting.

669
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,555
<i>Why were you so hard to reach?</i>

670
01:02:47,638 --> 01:02:49,766
I was in an area with no reception.

671
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:50,683
But…

672
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:53,269
what's with your tone?

673
01:02:53,352 --> 01:02:55,646
What's wrong with it, 406?

674
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:58,733
Isn't it thrilling?

675
01:03:00,443 --> 01:03:01,277
"Thrilling"?

676
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:05,531
Why? Do you miss her?

677
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:11,537
Yes.

678
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,997
I miss her.

679
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:14,499
What do you miss?

680
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:17,335
The chilly tone in her voice
when she threatened me.

681
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:19,670
That sharp voice.

682
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,381
Why did you like it?

683
01:03:24,509 --> 01:03:25,760
She didn't hold back.

684
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,346
<i>If you're upset with me</i>

685
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,973
and don't say anything, I won't know.

686
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:34,894
And if you stay silent,
I might think I'm doing everything right.

687
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,855
I like it when my wife

688
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,399
doesn't hold back.

689
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,069
<i>Don't hold back anymore.</i>

690
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,029
Throw a tantrum, complain,

691
01:03:45,863 --> 01:03:46,989
and nag if you want.

692
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:48,699
<i>Do you promise?</i>

693
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:50,993
Yes.

694
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,119
Do you swear?

695
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:53,704
Yes.

696
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,122
But,

697
01:03:56,249 --> 01:03:57,667
if I call,

698
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:59,085
<i>what will you do for me?</i>

01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:03,256

<i>So from now on,</i>
<i>call me for the rest of your life.</i>

701
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,346
I'll answer every time
as if it's the first call.

702
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,727
Then starting now,
I'll tell you what I want.

703
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:17,812
Listen carefully.

704
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:19,188
What's that?

705
01:04:19,272 --> 01:04:23,276
Come back to me as soon as you can.

706
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,529
Right now, into my arms.

01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,531

<i>Would things have been different…</i>

711
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,052
<i>if they had been more honest</i>

712
01:04:51,053 --> 01:04:52,305
<i>and shown their true feelings?</i>

713
01:04:53,723 --> 01:04:55,766
<i>If they try to make an effort now,</i>

714
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,521
<i>could they live</i>

715
01:05:02,356 --> 01:05:05,359
<i>There's a couple here now.</i>

01:05:06,569 --> 01:05:10,573
