00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:49,799
Did you know already?

4
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,428
It doesn't matter?

5
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,474
If…

6
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:00,351
something happens to me,

7
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,981
and the Paik Sa-eon you've known

8
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,317
disappears from this world,

9
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,070
just remember this.

11
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:21,498
The only Paik Sa-eon I want to leave
behind in this world is the one

12
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:24,876
that belongs to Hong Hee-joo.

13
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:28,254
I know I have no right to say this,

14
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:29,339
but Hee-joo,

15
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,883
I hope you won't be fooled anymore.

16
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:36,888
I know your mom forced you to marry him
in my place, and you had no choice,

17
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:39,516
but if the Paik family deceived us
from the start,

18
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,142
you don't have to stay married to him.

19
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,565
I'll find out the secret
that family is hiding from us.

20
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:49,484
I'll meet Paik Sa-eon if I have to.

21
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,197
It's my choice.

22
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:06,334
I wasn't just your stand-in.

23
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:08,837
It's not because my mom forced me.

24
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,840
I, Hong Hee-joo, choose Paik Sa-eon.

25
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:13,591
Hee-joo.

26
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,261
And he's not the only one who has secrets.

27
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,763
I've deceived him too.

28
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,933
Including about being able to speak.

29
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,358
So this is what your voice sounds like.

30
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,071
It's pretty.

31
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,324
I don't know how it'd sound to you,

32
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:40,493
but when we were young,

33
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,581
I liked how you called my name.

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,041
Though I hated your mom

35
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:50,044
and it felt weird to suddenly have
a younger sibling…

36
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,631
"In-a."

37
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,343
Your voice was so adorable.

38
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,931
To have a little sister
who called my name like that…

39
00:03:05,268 --> 00:03:06,853
It was really nice, to be honest.

40
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,163
Who sent you…

41
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,124
this document?

42
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,252
I don't know.

43
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:33,087
It was sent anonymously.

44
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:35,548
And it wasn't my dad or your mom.

45
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,009
But I'm certain of one thing.

46
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,053
They knew

47
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,765
I wouldn't marry Paik Sa-eon
if I saw this.

48
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,644
So, someone hoped
the marriage wouldn't go through.

We have to get out of here!

52
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,639
He's after you!

00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,099
Go! Hurry!

54
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:27,392
No!

PAIK SA-EON

57
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:55,253
I'd like to report a missing person.

58
00:04:55,336 --> 00:04:56,296
A missing person?

59
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:59,882
Yes, I can't reach my husband,
and he hasn't come home yet.

60
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,677
How long has it been
since you last heard from him?

61
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,679
About six hours.

62
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,724
Could it be that your husband
is just running a little late?

63
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:10,685
We can't file a missing person report
based on that alone.

64
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:11,936
What can I do then?

65
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,772
In fact, an adult over 18
with no history of illness

66
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,276
or evidence of a crime is considered
a runaway, not a missing person…

67
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:21,779
There is evidence of a crime.
My husband is being threatened.

68
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,031
He's being threatened?

69
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:26,993
Yes, by a complete madman.
He might've done something to him.

70
00:05:27,076 --> 00:05:29,203
He set a fire and threw a bomb!

71
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:31,289
He even pushed someone off a cliff.

72
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:34,375
Threats, bombs,
and he even pushed someone off a cliff?

73
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,419
What's your husband's name?

74
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,214
Hello?

75
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:43,217
Ma'am, could I have your name
and your husband's name?

76
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:55,396
PAIK UI-YONG AND PAIK SA-EON
DNA NOT MATCHED

77
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:59,776
I wonder what his real name is.

78
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,570
What do you think his real name was,

79
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:04,906
and how did he end up living
as Paik Sa-eon?

80
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,700
When I first met Paik Sa-eon,

81
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:09,535
he was 15 years old.

82
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,121
I had never seen him before that.

83
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:13,915
Yes.

84
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,959
That was strange to me.

85
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:20,296
Paik Ui-yong had a son
who was two years older than I was.

86
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,299
He was living next door,
but I'd never seen him.

87
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,720
I think I understand now.

88
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:32,183
I see why his parents
treated him like a stranger.

89
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,019
There was no affection at all.

90
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:37,230
Maybe there's a biological son?

91
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:39,774
If the current Paik Sa-eon

92
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,944
became their son at the age of 15,

93
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:45,613
then who was Paik Sa-eon before that?

94
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,657
And why did they hide him?

95
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,994
EPISODE 9

96
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,585
-Why are you here at this hour?
-Did you come alone?

97
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,003
Where's Sa-eon?

98
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,466
Report it for me.

99
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:10,930
Sa-eon hasn't come home,
and I can't reach him.

100
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,225
How are you talking?

101
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,685
Mr. Min.

102
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,942
Chairman Paik

103
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:26,320
was known for doting on his grandson.

104
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:32,076
So, why did he keep his beloved grandson
hidden until he was 15?

105
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,580
There was a reason

106
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:38,040
his biological grandson
couldn't be shown to the world.

107
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:41,419
Is that why he presented
a flawless fake grandson?

108
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,545
Fake?

109
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,463
I…

110
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,716
have lived as Paik Sa-eon's wife
for three years,

111
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,385
and I only found out now.

112
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,513
That he's not your biological son.

113
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,307
Where do you get off saying that?

114
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,058
You must be mistaken.

115
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,644
You're not Sa-eon's real wife

116
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,188
but the stand-in.

117
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,899
Yeah, you're right.

118
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,026
Sa-eon's just a stand-in too.

119
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:05,943
Honey.

120
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,945
That's true, but he's different.

121
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,240
Isn't he

122
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,076
important and necessary to you both?

123
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,748
So find out right now
what happened to him.

124
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,545
Yes, I understand.

125
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:38,100
There have been no reports filed
under the spokesperson's name as of now.

126
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:44,065
Did you hear that?

127
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:45,566
Go home.

128
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:52,281
Fine.

129
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:56,786
I admit that Sa-eon
is very important and necessary to us.

130
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,580
So we won't just sit idly by, will we?

131
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:12,843
When did she start talking?

132
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,179
Did you know?

133
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,314
Excuse me.

134
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,736
How much does the spokesperson know

135
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,906
about the person making the threats?

136
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,534
What do you mean, "how much"?

137
00:09:38,786 --> 00:09:40,621
Everything he told the police.

138
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,961
So nothing more about the heterochromia?

139
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,589
What…

140
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,425
should he know?

141
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,317
When Mr. Paik was young,

142
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,819
he had eye surgery.

143
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,572
It's a little-known fact.

144
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:16,949
Since then,

145
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,953
his eyes were no longer different colors.

146
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,925
What about you, Sis? Do you know him well?

147
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,010
Listen carefully.

148
00:10:37,595 --> 00:10:38,971
In this world,

149
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,600
the person who knows Paik Sa-eon
the best is me.

150
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,648
When Paik Sa-eon first came to this house,

151
00:10:49,231 --> 00:10:51,400
he was like a scared stray cat.

152
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:54,862
I've never seen him
smile comfortably in this house.

153
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:56,822
I've always

154
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,824
felt sorry for him.

Yes, it's been two hours.

160
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,201
Was he hurt badly? Where and how bad…

161
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,452
Hee-joo, calm down.

162
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,538
-Take a seat.
-No, I…

163
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:55,631

Mr. Jeong Jin-seok?

00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,697
I came to ask you something.

Are you a cop?

Hello?

00:12:55,065 --> 00:12:56,609
I heard from one of the writers

174
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:59,653
that you found where Jeong Jin-seok lives.

175
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,155
Did you meet him?

176
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:04,158
I did, but it was pointless.

177
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,118
As soon as I mentioned the villa,

178
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,036
he got scared.

179
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,787
As if he feared the consequences.

180
00:13:15,461 --> 00:13:16,462
And?

181
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,882
Hello?

182
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:21,425
Sang-woo?

183
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,730
JUAN FISHING

184
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,699
Mr. Paik Sa-eon?

185
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,035
Mr. Jeong Jin-seok?

186
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,411
Mr. Jeong!

187
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,025
This is about how the fire started,

188
00:14:20,109 --> 00:14:23,946
who set it, and why Paik Sa-eon was there.

189
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:27,241
Also, your relationship with Paik Sa-eon.

190
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,619
I don't know any of that.

191
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:32,997
But…

192
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:38,043
I couldn't ignore the non-stop ringing
of his phone.

193
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:45,551
Thank you.

194
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,596
And…

195
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,350
I'm sorry, Sang-woo.

196
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,520
I've kept so many things from you.

197
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:02,735
-Is it over?
-Yeah.

198
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,571
For now, let's wait and see
until he wakes up.

199
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,282
All right, then.

200
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,159
It must've hurt.

201
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,414
It must've been scary.

202
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,381
You must've been lonely.

203
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,885
When I was hurt, scared, and lonely,

204
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,555
you watched over me…

205
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:17,518
and ran to me.

206
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,520
But that girl

207
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:22,356
had no one

208
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,442
to rely on, anywhere.

209
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,696
I wanted to help her escape.

210
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,614
Hoping that she could

211
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,617
leave that house and live freely.

212
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:37,663
And if you can, tell Hee-joo for me.

213
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,039
Tell her not to worry.

214
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:42,376
Tell her I'll be right there!

215
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,293
Tell me

216
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,713
how to hate you.

217
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,049
Tell me how to not love you.

218
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,886
It's my turn now.

219
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,639
It's my turn to protect you.

220
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:00,894
So, please wake up. Please.

221
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,699
DR. JI SANG-WOO

222
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:16,827
Thanks for waiting!

223
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:19,038
Eat up.

224
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:21,707
So, Crime Report. Right?

225
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:25,753
Did you receive any tip-off
about the Sinil Childcare Center?

226
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,965
Why are you interested in that?

227
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,050
What?

228
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,218
I'm already upset enough as it is.

229
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,472
Why treat me on a day
when I have no appetite, of all days?

230
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:37,389
Eat.

231
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,641
-Why?
-Try this too.

232
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,978
What is it? Just tell me.

233
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,271
Well…

234
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:49,693
Do you want to look into it yourself?

235
00:17:50,652 --> 00:17:51,487
Me?

236
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,700
Sure, take your time. Eat up.

237
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,083
Who, what, when, where,

238
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:07,002
how, and why it happened.

239
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:13,884
I'll give you the source.

240
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,636
Source?

241
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,055
-What is it?
-Well…

242
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,318
-Twins?
-Come on.

243
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,192
UNEXPLAINED FIRE IN JEONGI-DONG

244
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,110
DID YOU DO THIS?

245
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:17,573
I WARNED YOU NOT TO ACT ALONE

246
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,199
I CAN'T CLEAN UP ALL YOUR MESS

247
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,076
YOU'RE LUCKY PAIK SA-EON IS ALIVE

248
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,494
Paik Sa-eon?

249
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,843
I had no idea.

250
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,721
How did you know?

251
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,933
THIS IS YOUR LAST WARNING.
DON'T CAUSE TROUBLE, JUST WAIT.

252
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,353
Last warning?

253
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:52,232
I think you're the one
who'll cause trouble.

254
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,328
Father.

255
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,746
That old man came again?

256
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,707
-Who was the kid with him?
-I told you not to call me that!

257
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:02,427
Go to bed early here tonight.

258
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:04,972
And do not come outside.

259
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:06,473
Got it?

260
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:23,740
Help…

261
00:21:42,467 --> 00:21:43,844
I told you not to come out.

262
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,345
Go inside.

263
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:53,979
Help!

264
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,310
Some monsters are made,

265
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:35,562
but some are simply born.

266
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,106
It was bad luck.

267
00:22:38,815 --> 00:22:41,485
How dare something like that
be born into my family?

268
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,155
At first, it was a goldfish,
and then a cat.

269
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:49,451
Next, it was children younger than him.

270
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,329
What kept increasing

271
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:56,500
were the black bags filled with the dead.

272
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,503
But it's okay now.

273
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:03,298
That bastard ended up
in one of those bags too.

274
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:09,137
And now,
I'll fill the place of my grandson…

275
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:16,353
with whomever I please.

276
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:19,689
Child,

277
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,860
do you know why I didn't give you a name?

278
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,412
It's okay.

279
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,748
It's okay.

280
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,666
It's okay.

281
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:39,501
It's okay.

282
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,419
It's okay.

283
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,469
Are you okay?

284
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,096
Are you feeling better?

285
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:52,556
Hee-joo.

286
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:56,476
Yeah, it's me.

287
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,103
Can you see me?

288
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:04,067
I'll get the doctor.

289
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:08,947
I could hear your voice.

290
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:10,907
"It's okay."

291
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,704
You told me that.

292
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:17,956
Yeah.

293
00:24:19,958 --> 00:24:21,877
It's really okay now.

294
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,424
I'll go get the doctor.

295
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:31,678
Hee-joo.

296
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,180
He just woke up.

297
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:34,431
Is that so?

298
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,737
How are you feeling?

299
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,782
I'm fine.

300
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:54,201
I doubt that.

301
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:56,995
This is my father's hospital.

302
00:24:57,579 --> 00:25:00,290
I made sure word wouldn't get out,
so you can relax

303
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,917
and receive proper treatment.

304
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,462
What about

305
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,714
the person who was with me?

306
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:11,760
Is he alive?

307
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:02,310
Let me ask this first.

308
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,230
What's your relationship
with Jeong Jin-seok?

309
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,565
He raised me.

310
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:11,027
His original name's Jeong Sang-hun.

311
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:12,862
I'd been looking for so long

312
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,657
without knowing that he had changed it.

313
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:19,286
He raised you?

314
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,581
It's a long story.

315
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,084
Complicated and personal.

316
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,211
Is Hee-joo involved
in this personal matter?

317
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:31,756
Hee-joo

318
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:35,218
is my only family and guardian.

319
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,139
It's not an inappropriate relationship.

320
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,099
So don't worry.

321
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:44,269
If it's not, then why do you hide it?

322
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,068
Why should I expose Hee-joo to the world?

323
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,363
My complicated personal matters

324
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,657
will be revealed soon.

325
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,577
When people start criticizing me,

326
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,121
do you want them to gossip

327
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:05,123
about Hee-joo too?

328
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,310
Thank you.

329
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:29,314
I think I've gotten you wrong.

330
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,316
I apologize.

331
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,743
Can I ask you a favor?

332
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:43,870
What is it?

333
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:45,622
Please do everything you can

334
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,334
to help him wake up.

335
00:27:50,085 --> 00:27:51,544
He's a key witness

336
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:54,381
to the Sinil Childcare Center case.

337
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,674
And he provided a crucial tip-off.

338
00:27:58,510 --> 00:27:59,427
A tip-off?

339
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,348
"He's alive."

340
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,350
The real culprit in that case,

341
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:09,020
the one who's blackmailing me
and sending me death threats.

342
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,607
It's the same person?

343
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,027
I thought he was dead,

344
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,947
but he's alive.

345
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,877
CANDIDATE PAIK UI-YONG'S INTRO

346
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,842
The cameras are ready.

347
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:41,261
But…

348
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,724
They're asking again
if the spokesperson still can't make it.

349
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,475
Filming starts soon.

350
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:50,478
What do you think?

351
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:51,980
I apologize.

352
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:57,193
Any word from Sa-eon?

353
00:28:58,027 --> 00:28:58,862
No, sir.

354
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,282
Still, there haven't been
any incident reports.

355
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:03,616
That's good enough.

356
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,084
Did you check what I asked you to?

357
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:20,550
I have been keeping an eye
on the professor…

358
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,595
Nothing unusual so far.

359
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:27,891
TEXT MESSAGE

360
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,533
HEE-JOO

361
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,243
Are you still at work?

362
00:29:48,411 --> 00:29:50,205
Will you be late?
You said you'd come early.

363
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:53,500
I can't reach you. Are you busy?
Why can't I reach you?

364
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,961
It's past 11 p.m. Why aren't you home yet?

365
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,380
And you're not picking up.

366
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,424
Where are you?

367
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,726
PAIK SA-EON

368
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,523
YOU HAVE A NEW VOICEMAIL

369
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:22,654
You have new messages. First message.

370
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,656
Where are you? Is something wrong?

371
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,785
This has never happened before.

372
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:32,330
You always let me know
if you're not coming home.

373
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,291
No matter how late,
you always slept at home.

374
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,795
See you at home.

375
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:42,715
I won't be late.

376
00:30:49,764 --> 00:30:51,933
You said you wouldn't be late.

377
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,685
So, why aren't you home?

378
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:09,659
I'll check your blood pressure.

379
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,419
Is my guardian outside?

380
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:21,504
No, no one's outside.

381
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:33,975
PAIK SA-EON

382
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:01,127
HEE-JOO

383
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,464
Where did you go?

384
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:30,031
These crabs were caught
early this morning in Seosan.

385
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:35,453
My wife's favorite dish is blue crab stew,
so I make it often.

386
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,038
Now,

387
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:41,000
shall we see how fresh these crabs are?

388
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,543
Okay.

389
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:45,630
Look at this.

390
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:47,465
It's still alive.

391
00:32:50,426 --> 00:32:51,719
Look!

392
00:33:10,196 --> 00:33:11,072
See?

393
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:14,492
Prepping these live crabs
isn't easy, you see.

394
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:16,202
Honey!

395
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,541
This is what I've done for you
all this time.

396
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:25,503
Now, you make blue crab stew often
for your wife,

397
00:33:26,129 --> 00:33:29,799
so what do you usually make for your son?

398
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,467
Well… For my son?

399
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:35,221
Yes, what does the spokesperson like?

400
00:33:35,304 --> 00:33:38,182
He takes after me, so he likes seafood.

401
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:41,936
When it comes to seafood, he's not picky.

402
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,194
Now, my son couldn't make it today,

403
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,657
so to make up for it,
I invited a special guest.

404
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:56,951
You can look forward to it.

405
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,049
Welcome.

406
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,508
My daughter-in-law.

407
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,315
BEOMJIN DONGAN POLICE STATION

408
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:41,079
What are you doing here?

409
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:46,793
Why did you come in your state?

410
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,044
Why did you come here?

411
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,303
Give me that.

412
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,609
So, why did you lie to me?

413
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,487
I know everything now.

414
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:16,823
I know you're not Paik Sa-eon.

415
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,785
I even know who the real Paik Sa-eon is.

416
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:22,954
You're worse than me.

417
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:26,541
You've deceived me
more doggedly than I did,

418
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:28,960
and for much longer.

419
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,504
So without knowing anything,

420
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:36,592
I teamed up with the guy
who tried to ruin you.

421
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,761
I threatened and tormented you.

422
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:43,182
Who knows what he'll do now?

423
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,144
So I can't just let him be.

424
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,313
-Hee-joo…
-For once!

425
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,236
For once,

426
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,072
I want to protect you.

427
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,160
So that you never suffer…

428
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:07,874
or get hurt again.

429
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,918
You know what?

430
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:16,549
You could get hurt and be in danger again
if you stay with me.

431
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,636
But I'm asking you to stay by my side
because I can't let you go.

432
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,099
You still don't get it?

433
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:29,270
I lived because of you.
I endured because of you.

434
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:44,160
Hong Hee-joo.

435
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,287
Even if I'm not

436
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,664
the Paik Sa-eon you knew,

437
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,459
does it not matter?

438
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,674
It didn't matter to you either.

439
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:02,762
Whether I was the Hong Hee-joo
who couldn't speak or could speak,

440
00:37:02,845 --> 00:37:03,846
and even when I was 406,

441
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:05,181
you knew, but it didn't matter.

442
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,728
I'm happy to finally know the real you.

443
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:13,105
No.

444
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,942
I'm sorry for realizing it so late.

445
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,753
Did you know?

446
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,879
I did not.

447
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:40,633
But it seems he and In-a
had been in contact beforehand.

448
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:45,638
But she is

449
00:37:46,764 --> 00:37:49,225
able to talk and listen now.

450
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,613
I've been curious about this.

451
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:05,741
Who does Spokesperson Paik take after?

452
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,371
No matter how closely I look at him,

453
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:12,164
he doesn't resemble either of you.

454
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:15,501
Come on. What are you talking about?

455
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:17,253
Back in my prime,

456
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:21,382
I had big, bright eyes
and a sharp jawline, just like Sa-eon.

457
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:23,092
-Really?
-Of course.

458
00:38:23,175 --> 00:38:24,677
Then show me some old photos.

459
00:38:25,261 --> 00:38:26,470
Do you have an album?

460
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:28,180
Don't you want to see

461
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,516
what the spokesperson looked like
as a child?

462
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:32,184
I bet he was so cute.

463
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,477
-Show us!
-Yeah, show us!

464
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:35,354
-Show us.
-Yeah, he was cute.

465
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,731
-Excuse me.
-He was cute.

466
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:38,149
I have a question too.

467
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:39,900
Since the wedding,

468
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:41,861
you and the spokesperson

469
00:38:41,944 --> 00:38:44,030
haven't attended
any official events together.

470
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,032
Can I ask you why?

471
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:52,371
The Paik Sa-eon I knew before the wedding

472
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:54,790
and the Paik Sa-eon I got to know after…

473
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,212
are two completely different people.

474
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:02,298
What?

475
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,968
What do you mean by that?

476
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:12,183
The Paik Sa-eon I knew before the wedding
is this person.

477
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,853
But I later found out

478
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,064
that their son…

479
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,825
Hey, In-a!

480
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,247
This is why daytime drinking is dangerous.
You can't even hold your liquor!

481
00:39:38,125 --> 00:39:39,251
Sir.

482
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,003
A package came for you.

483
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:42,922
Thank you! Now!

484
00:39:43,005 --> 00:39:45,007
The abalone from Wando is here!

485
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,302
They're fresh and very big!

486
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,261
Open it.

487
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,262
Yes, sir.

488
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:54,975
-What is that?
-What?

489
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,478
-What is that? That's gross!
-What is that?

490
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:10,593
Who is it?

491
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,845
It says Dr. Ji Sang-woo.

492
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,064
Sang-woo!

493
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,652
Be careful.

494
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:32,323
Are you okay?

495
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,576
What? What's that?

496
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:37,161
What happened?

497
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,163
I got a little hurt.

498
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,080
"A little"?

499
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,957
This isn't a little.

500
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,459
What?

501
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,045
What about there?

502
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,256
What about here?

503
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,091
Well…

504
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,057
-Close your eyes for a second.
-My eyes?

505
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:03,229
There. Open them.

506
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,358
One eye had camel-like eyelashes.

507
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,984
-Camel?
-Or giraffe?

508
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:11,487
Is that the only thing you can think of?

509
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,033
I mean, there are other things,
like a peacock.

510
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:17,159
Sure.

511
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:18,953
Let's go with peacock.

512
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,501
Wait.

513
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,419
That's not important right now.

514
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:29,797
This, this, and this.

515
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,714
Well?

516
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,174
Who did this?

517
00:42:32,258 --> 00:42:34,134
It's kind of a long story.

518
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,135
Really?

519
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,306
Then follow me.

520
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,224
Let's go.

521
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:45,896
It was just a small accident.
There was a fire.

522
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:47,481
A fire?

523
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,652
That's okay.

524
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:53,988
-Sorry.
-It didn't splatter much.

525
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,490
Still…

526
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:58,951
I'd say I was pretty fortunate.

527
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:06,083
Who started the fire and why?

528
00:43:06,959 --> 00:43:08,127
I'm sorry, but…

529
00:43:10,212 --> 00:43:11,380
I can't tell you yet.

530
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,466
It involves someone's personal life,
and it's not my place to share.

531
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,056
I don't like secrets either.

532
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,057
Sang-woo.

533
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,979
Must you keep…

534
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,649
digging into this case?

535
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:36,238
The higher-ups are pressuring us
not to air it.

536
00:43:37,364 --> 00:43:39,116
Someone's trying to cover it up.

537
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:51,962
I never gave consent,
so don't even think about showing my face.

538
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:55,716
In-a.

539
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,432
What are you doing?

540
00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:05,267
What do you mean?

541
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,978
I came to ask questions
that need to be asked.

542
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:26,413
Do you need anything?

543
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:31,085
Stay by my side until I fall asleep.

544
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,345
I'll be right here.

545
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:47,017
I'm having trouble sleeping.

546
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,019
When I close my eyes,

547
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,980
I have nightmares about fire.

548
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:11,333
How did you find me earlier?

549
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:13,752
Give me my phone.

550
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,764
LOCATION SHARING

551
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:26,849
When did you…

552
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,937
Right after the cliff accident.

553
00:45:33,522 --> 00:45:34,565
I felt anxious.

554
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,487
I want it on my phone too.

555
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,281
I'm anxious too.

556
00:45:43,198 --> 00:45:44,032
Hong Hee-joo.

557
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,743
If…

558
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:50,998
you can't reach me again

559
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:53,625
in the future…

560
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:57,629
or don't know where I am,

561
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,174
don't look for me.

562
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:01,925
Promise me.

563
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:04,678
No.

564
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:11,185
Don't look for me, and just wait.

565
00:46:11,977 --> 00:46:13,854
I'll come find you.

566
00:46:16,273 --> 00:46:17,274
Don't worry.

567
00:46:18,692 --> 00:46:20,652
I know who he is now.

568
00:46:23,030 --> 00:46:23,989
I'll handle it.

569
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,117
What do you think he wants?

570
00:46:28,327 --> 00:46:31,205
Does he want to get back
what was once his? His name?

571
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,248
His place?

572
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,417
No matter what he wants,

573
00:46:37,169 --> 00:46:39,046
what I want is clear,

574
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,673
to leave behind the name Paik Sa-eon…

575
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:45,928
and start fresh with you.

576
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,599
Let's be happy together.

577
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,938
Go to sleep.

578
00:46:57,606 --> 00:47:00,108
Don't have any bad dreams. Just sleep.

579
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,196
I'll be right here.

580
00:48:22,899 --> 00:48:25,736
JI SANG-WOO

581
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,238
Jeong Jin-seok, I mean…

582
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,407
Jeong Sang-hun is awake.

583
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:32,534
He'd asked for you the moment he woke up.

584
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:55,057
You did great.

585
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,309
I'm sorry.

586
00:48:58,518 --> 00:48:59,561
Back then…

587
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:04,149
I never should've saved him.

588
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:09,529
Take care of it.

589
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,948
Yes, sir.

590
00:49:41,895 --> 00:49:43,772
I couldn't bring myself to kill…

591
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,567
a child who almost died.

592
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:50,529
He had lost all his memories.

593
00:49:51,571 --> 00:49:53,281
His mental abilities had weakened.

594
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,785
So I thought it'd be okay
if I quietly looked after him.

595
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,287
But his natural instincts…

596
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,166
remained the same.

597
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,627
Just as you took me in

598
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,715
and raised me as your own,

599
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,262
you couldn't have cast him aside either.

600
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:22,644
Where are they?

601
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,439
The black bags Paik Jang-ho

602
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,442
asked you to take care of.

603
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:37,159
I have to find them.

604
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,578
I'll find them…

605
00:50:41,621 --> 00:50:43,039
and expose everything he did.

606
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:56,238
He's in the hospital?

607
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,991
Yes. It seems he got hurt quite a bit.

608
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,036
But he insists on attending today's event,

609
00:52:03,745 --> 00:52:04,663
so I'm worried.

610
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:07,457
I wonder what happened this time.

611
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:08,792
Was he injured badly?

612
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,210
I don't know.

613
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,170
Shouldn't we go see him?

614
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:13,755
-Where?
-At the hospital.

615
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:18,051
But would the spokesperson
be happy to see us?

616
00:52:18,134 --> 00:52:19,678
We don't know which hospital.

617
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:20,679
We do.

618
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,851
-I don't know.
-Again?

619
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,394
Again?

620
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:31,481
When he says "I don't know,"
we never get what we want to know.

621
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,026
However, don't worry, everyone.

622
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:38,780
There's a way to find out
which hospital he's in.

623
00:52:40,323 --> 00:52:43,159
But do we have to find out?

624
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:44,911
I know.

625
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:46,371
I can hear you.

626
00:52:46,454 --> 00:52:47,330
Here.

627
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,248
Thanks.

628
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:57,507
The director of Nuri Dream Center told me…

629
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,802
that when we were in college,

630
00:53:01,428 --> 00:53:06,099
you came to volunteer
and were holding a crying baby,

631
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,477
singing a lullaby to calm the baby down.

632
00:53:12,230 --> 00:53:15,817
Good night, my baby

633
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:20,780
My dear baby

634
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:24,034
There are beautiful roses

635
00:53:25,201 --> 00:53:29,205
Surrounding you

636
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,250
Good night…

637
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:36,087
That's right. I think I remember that.

638
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:38,506
I'm sorry, Sang-woo.

639
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,258
I had no idea.

640
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,593
You're sorry?

641
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:45,138
I got to hear your voice,

642
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,223
so it's fine.

643
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:55,815
The spokesperson and I…

644
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,609
Yeah, you don't have to explain.

645
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:02,781
At first, I was surprised and worried,

646
00:54:02,864 --> 00:54:04,032
but there's one thing…

647
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:06,451
I'm sure of.

648
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:15,210
That he's not hiding you
but protecting you.

649
00:54:17,796 --> 00:54:20,215
I face attacks from all sides.

650
00:54:21,174 --> 00:54:24,511
In a way, you could say
I'm the government's official scapegoat.

651
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,846
So I don't want

652
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:30,100
my wife to be exposed
to indiscriminate attacks like I am.

653
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:32,936
Yes, she's my weakness.

654
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,657
You're ready to go already?

655
00:54:46,908 --> 00:54:47,993
Yeah.

656
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,370
I'll do it for you.

657
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:52,998
Do you know how?

658
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,332
How do I do it?

659
00:54:55,750 --> 00:54:56,584
Here.

660
00:54:56,668 --> 00:54:58,253
Grab both ends of the tie.

661
00:54:59,379 --> 00:55:00,380
Cross them over.

662
00:55:01,297 --> 00:55:04,134
Next, loop it here and pull it through.

663
00:55:25,905 --> 00:55:26,781
Is that good?

664
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,241
Great job.

665
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,539
Are you prepared for today's event?

666
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:36,041
Of course.

667
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:40,045
But will you really be okay?

668
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,796
I'll be fine.

669
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:46,051
So you come with the rest of the team.
And be careful.

670
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,385
Okay?

671
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:00,315
Don't worry about me.

672
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,317
You be careful too.

673
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,694
Okay.

674
00:56:15,622 --> 00:56:17,373
CHIEF KANG YOUNG-WOO

675
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,046
Yes, Mr. Kang.

676
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,423
We're here.

677
00:56:26,674 --> 00:56:27,509
Where?

678
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,011
Didn't you say you'd have it delivered?

679
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,180
No way! We came in person.

680
00:56:32,263 --> 00:56:33,181
Sorry about that.

681
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:38,103
We've brought your commemorative speech
and your morning coffee.

682
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:45,110
What?

683
00:56:47,112 --> 00:56:48,905
-The paper.
-Here you go.

684
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:50,990
And my coffee?

685
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:53,618
Are you feeling okay?

686
00:56:53,701 --> 00:56:56,538
Yes, I'm fine. I'll see you all later.

687
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:57,539
Can we come in--

688
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:00,375
I was just about to go through
the discharge process.

689
00:57:00,458 --> 00:57:02,252
You should all go.

690
00:57:02,335 --> 00:57:04,546
Okay, we'll see you at the event then.

691
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:10,385
Sir, I'm leading the event today,

692
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,929
so I want to rehearse it with you
before I go.

693
00:57:13,012 --> 00:57:16,057
Once you're done with the process,
we can do it inside…

694
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:17,767
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

695
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:19,060
Do we still need…

696
00:57:20,478 --> 00:57:21,896
to rehearse it together?

697
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:25,233
No. Of course not.

698
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:32,699
You and I are like a well-oiled machine.
We're perfectly in sync, the best team.

699
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,662
-Mr. Park?
-Yes?

700
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:38,580
Come see me.

701
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:46,963
2024
ENVIRONMENTAL CLIMATE DAY

702
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:50,675
Let's sit here.

703
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,056
-Hello.
-How pretty.

704
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:02,520
2024 ENVIRONMENTAL CLIMATE DAY

705
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:19,037
Are you ready, Ms. Hong Hee-joo?

706
00:58:20,538 --> 00:58:21,998
Yes, Mr. Paik.

707
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:25,502
You look a bit nervous.

708
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,838
I'm confident I can do well.

709
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:32,967
I've been dreaming of this moment
for so long.

710
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:37,388
I'm looking forward to it too.

711
00:58:38,223 --> 00:58:39,933
The moment I'll stand side by side

712
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,268
with Interpreter Hong Hee-joo.

713
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:21,391
Greetings,

714
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,602
esteemed citizens and honored guests.

715
00:59:25,478 --> 00:59:27,647
I am Paik Sa-eon,
the Presidential spokesperson.

716
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,276
SPOKESPERSON SPEECH

717
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,903
Interpreter Hong Hee-joo is so impressive.

718
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:36,990
Of course, I knew it.
She's the best at our center.

719
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,783
So good!

720
00:59:38,866 --> 00:59:41,411
…we often heard that
we were living in an era of extreme

721
00:59:41,494 --> 00:59:42,453
climate change.

722
00:59:42,537 --> 00:59:44,998
I'm so proud. My daughter.

723
00:59:46,207 --> 00:59:47,166
My son-in-law.

724
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,752
…an era of climate "crisis,"
not just "change."

725
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,921
I sincerely hope that this event

726
00:59:52,005 --> 00:59:56,551
will foster constructive discussions
aimed at finding solutions

727
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:59,429
to climate issues
and presenting new visions.

728
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:02,390
I believe that
if we all continue our efforts,

729
01:00:02,974 --> 01:00:05,351
a better future will come.

730
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,186
Thank you.

731
01:00:34,047 --> 01:00:35,590
-Hello?
-Are you busy?

732
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:36,841
Yeah, I'm busy.

733
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:38,259
You punk.

734
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,345
That Sinil Childcare Center case.

735
01:00:40,428 --> 01:00:43,056
I went through everything
and found nothing.

736
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:44,015
Does that make sense?

737
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:45,642
Is that why you called?

738
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:46,934
By the way,

739
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:50,730
did you know there were twins
among the missing kids?

740
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:53,858
-Twins?
-Yeah.

741
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:54,859
So the family

742
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:57,278
of the missing person could be out there.

743
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,697
I mean, the other twin.

744
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:01,366
So what?

745
01:01:01,449 --> 01:01:04,786
One reason this case is difficult
is that the kids are orphans,

746
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,121
and there are no victim families.

747
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:08,665
But if we find the twin…

748
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,209
We might get a testimony or statement?

749
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:12,126
That's right.

750
01:01:12,710 --> 01:01:14,504
Hey, if anything comes up,

751
01:01:15,088 --> 01:01:16,506
I get the exclusive interview.

752
01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,590
Got it?

753
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:34,148
Yedong-myeon, Sinjeok Mountain.

754
01:01:34,816 --> 01:01:36,818
You'll find them there.

755
01:01:37,527 --> 01:01:39,153
I always thought

756
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,323
that someday the day would come

757
01:01:42,907 --> 01:01:45,410
when I'd have to atone for my sins.

758
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,304
The spokesperson asked me
to take you back to the office.

759
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:09,308
Great work today.

Hello?

762
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:35,812
It's me.

763
01:03:37,104 --> 01:03:41,484
The police gave me access, so I checked
the missing person's family DNA database.

764
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:45,530
I looked for "twins" from Sinil Childcare
Center in Hajeong, Gyeonggi-do in 2000.

765
01:03:46,155 --> 01:03:47,031
And?

766
01:03:47,114 --> 01:03:49,951
The younger twin's information
came through.

767
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:53,871
I'll send it to you.

768
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:55,540
Check it yourself.

Hurry and come to the memorial service.

784
01:06:39,412 --> 01:06:40,830

785
01:06:40,913 --> 01:06:42,039
Paik Sa-eon.

786
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:44,041
I'm really going to kill her.

787
01:06:44,917 --> 01:06:46,585
-Your wife.
-Don't come.

788
01:06:47,753 --> 01:06:48,963
For once,

789
01:06:49,755 --> 01:06:51,257
I want to protect you.

790
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:53,634
I love you.
