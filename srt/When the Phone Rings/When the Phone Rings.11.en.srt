WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:51,885
3 YEARS AGO, WEDDING DAY

3
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:56,324
<i>That bedroom is yours from now on.</i>

4
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,576
<i>I won't be going into that room.</i>

5
00:02:04,541 --> 00:02:06,709
<i>I'll use the room near the entrance,</i>

6
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,462
<i>and I don't want you in here either.</i>

7
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,658
Did you not read my text?

8
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,743
I told you there was no need
to prepare meals.

9
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,247
I don't know when I'll leave work,
so don't wait up.

10
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,169
<i>What if…</i>

11
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:52,755
<i>I had told you back then</i>

12
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,010
<i>that I felt at ease</i>
<i>with you in this house,</i>

13
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,934
<i>that I was glad you became my wife,</i>

14
00:03:05,602 --> 00:03:07,896
<i>and that I couldn't sleep a wink</i>
<i>because of you…</i>

15
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:40,970
Hong Hee-joo,

16
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:43,640
do you like being married to me

17
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:45,475
or not?

18
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,020
If you don't hate it,

19
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:51,814
how about we slowly…

20
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,360
get to know each other better?

21
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:06,037
<i>Instead of dedicating it</i>
<i>to hatred and revenge,</i>

22
00:04:07,038 --> 00:04:08,790
<i>if I had dedicated my life</i>

23
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,125
<i>to love and happiness with you…</i>

24
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,671
<i>I'm now paying the price</i>

25
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,841
<i>for not doing that,</i>

26
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:20,969
<i>Hee-joo.</i>

27
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,263
EPISODE 11

28
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,313
I can't find Hee-joo! We were together.

29
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,065
I'll find her.

30
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,276
Hee-joo!

31
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:38,152
Hee-joo!

32
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,617
Hee-joo!

33
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:49,455
UNKNOWN CALLER

34
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:54,043
<i>Paik Sa-eon.</i>

35
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,964
<i>I'll kill her.</i>

36
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,134
<i>I'm really going to kill her.</i>

37
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,219
<i>Your wife.</i>

38
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:10,685
Hee-joo, don't worry. I'm coming.

39
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,854
- I'm coming right now.
<i>- Don't come.</i>

40
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,443
I told you.

41
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:21,529
For once,

42
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,282
I want to protect you.

43
00:05:25,366 --> 00:05:26,784
<i>Just remember this.</i>

44
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,162
I love you…

45
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,418
so very much.

46
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,087
Hee-joo.

47
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,422
I love you.

48
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,471
You crazy bitch! Again with that?

49
00:05:47,055 --> 00:05:48,431
Do you remember?

50
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,975
Once you start,
you see it through to the end.

51
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,602
That's what you said.

52
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,936
Since I started it,

53
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,731
I'm going to end it.

54
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,150
I'll make sure
you never make him suffer again!

55
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,156
Hee-joo…

56
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,241
Hee-joo!

57
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:34,268
NO VEHICLE ENTRY

58
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,391
- Hello?
<i>- We found it.</i>

59
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,115
You said you found it. What did you find?

60
00:07:29,907 --> 00:07:30,908
I don't see the car.

61
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:32,660
Well…

62
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,663
It seems the car

63
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:38,708
was going very fast
at the time of the accident.

64
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:43,963
It hit this guardrail
and went straight down.

65
00:07:55,516 --> 00:07:56,601
Also,

66
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:58,853
we found this

67
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,605
at the scene.

68
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:13,701
I think…

69
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:16,621
we should start the search.

70
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,221
What happened?

71
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:34,889
Where's Hee-joo?

72
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:35,890
Did the car…

73
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,559
fall down there?

74
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,063
No way.

75
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:43,940
- Hee-joo!
- Honey, calm down.

76
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,984
Calm down, honey!
Will you start the search right away?

77
00:08:52,823 --> 00:08:55,493
Why did you spare him and let this happen?

78
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,870
Bring that bastard to me right now!

79
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,497
What the hell are you saying?

80
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,290
Who says I spared him?

81
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,959
Your father tricked me!

82
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:04,544
That sly old fox!

83
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,170
That's enough!

84
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,130
What's the point of blaming anyone now?

85
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,508
Since when did you care
about your children?

86
00:09:10,591 --> 00:09:13,344
Don't you know
you brought this upon yourself?

87
00:09:13,427 --> 00:09:14,929
You can find Hee-joo, right?

88
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,641
Please, find her. Hee-joo…

89
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,143
Hee-joo.

90
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:23,813
Hee-joo…

91
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,830
My mother didn't come.

92
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,123
What?

93
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,629
Yes, we checked them all.

94
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:50,756
We don't see her.

95
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,342
<i>We checked all the mourners' dashcams,</i>

96
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,095
but Professor Shim Kyu-jin
wasn't on any of them.

97
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,181
The back gate cameras
are for real-time monitoring,

98
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:01,142
<i>so they weren't recording.</i>

99
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,728
I understand.

100
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:52,735
NO RECORDED VIDEOS

101
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,329
<i>Yes.</i>

102
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:05,623
The dashcam footage
from Professor Shim's car

103
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:06,916
has been deleted.

104
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,877
<i>Seize and recover it,</i>
<i>and check her phone and location data</i>

105
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,088
to find out where she was
during the accident.

106
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,465
Okay, I'll request a search warrant first.

107
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,154
What are you doing here?

108
00:11:41,158 --> 00:11:42,159
What are you doing?

109
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,999
You haven't been crying.

110
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:53,712
You don't know whether your son
is alive or dead right now,

111
00:11:53,796 --> 00:11:55,714
yet you didn't come to the scene

112
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,967
or cry.

113
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:01,262
You're something else.

114
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,805
Why…

115
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,392
should I cry?

116
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,525
Your father, Paik Jang-ho,

117
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,944
said my son fell into the water

118
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,488
and drowned when he took him fishing.

119
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:24,368
We searched the entire lake,
but the boy was nowhere to be found.

120
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:30,291
I struggled in agony,

121
00:12:30,374 --> 00:12:33,544
not knowing whether my son
was alive or dead,

122
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,047
beating my chest
as I cried and cried again.

123
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:41,260
Whenever I heard
that a body had been found washed up,

124
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:43,846
I ran barefoot to the scene.

125
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:48,058
I already did that

126
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:52,438
more than enough 20 years ago.

127
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:56,609
And now,

128
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,156
isn't it your turn…

129
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,160
to experience that pain?

130
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:17,338
Since Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon's
press conference…

131
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:18,422
4 DAYS SINCE THE ACCIDENT

132

133
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:22,635
but Ms. Hong Hee-joo
has not been found yet.

134
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:25,638
Rescue authorities have announced plans

135
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:27,973

<i>so Hong Hee-joo can return</i>

142

to her family's arms as soon as possible.

143
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:04,885
You think it'll be okay?

144
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:07,721
I'm fine.

145
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,891
I still have a lot of energy left.

146
00:14:10,975 --> 00:14:11,934
No, the weather.

147
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,313
They said it won't rain.

148
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,983
Surely the sky won't turn against us.

149
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,485
Let's pray.

150
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,697
I'm not religious.
I've never prayed this much.

151
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,372
Me too.

152
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,877
By the way, when are you going to ask me?

153
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:39,837
About what?

154
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,507
Whether or not I knew
Hee-joo was Paik Sa-eon's wife,

155
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,051
and why I didn't tell you if I did.

156
00:14:48,178 --> 00:14:50,890
You told me to hear it for myself.

157
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,808
Were you talking about Hee-joo?

158
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,227
Yeah. I'm sorry.

159
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:57,396
Why would you be sorry?

160
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,398
Hee-joo should apologize.

161
00:15:01,984 --> 00:15:04,278
"Did you have fun
fooling me all this time?"

162
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,073
"You really went too far."
I'll confront her.

163
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:09,742
I will get an apology from her.

164
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,498
Hee-joo's in big trouble.

165
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:18,417
She's really going to get it.

166
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,546
Hey, you know what?

167
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:25,299
Hee-joo can talk too.

168
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,219
She can… what?

169
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,846
She talks really well.

170
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:33,265
She's got a great voice too.

171
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,651
This won't do.

172
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:47,446
- Step on it?
- Yeah.

173
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:49,865
Let's find Hee-joo quickly.

174
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:50,950
I need to find her

175
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,162

00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:48,298
I'm so sorry.

186
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,551
Something got in my eye.

187
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,016
There they are. Over here.

188
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,568
Sorry we're late.
You're all here today as well.

189
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,696
Thank you for your help.

190
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,240
I should be thanking you.

191
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:16,493
You are all stepping up like this,

192
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,413
and I'm so grateful.

193
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:28,088
By the way, where's Sa-eon?

194
00:17:29,548 --> 00:17:31,175
Yeah, he's normally at the scene.

195
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,970
He received a call
and left only a little while ago.

196
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,388
To where?

197
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,807
We don't know. He left in such a hurry.

198
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:45,522
EVIDENCE
CHAIN OF CUSTODY, ON-SITE EVIDENCE

199
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,566
Please check

200
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,903
if it belongs to Hong Hee-joo.

201
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,161
ON-SITE EVIDENCE

202
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,418
Downstream from where these were found,
there's a dam.

203
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,339
She hasn't been found
even after searching this area…

204
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,551
- So the chances of survival--
- You can tell me…

205
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:18,722
when her body is found.

206
00:18:18,806 --> 00:18:19,640
Excuse me?

207
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,559
You can save that…

208
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:25,687
for when her body is found.

209
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:30,359
We still need to search more.

210
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,279
What about the search warrant?

211
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:35,989
We still don't have it?

212
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:39,284
I just got a call about that.

213
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:41,495
It was rejected.

214
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,581
It's hard to prove the charges
with just suspicions or statements,

215
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:46,542
and as you well know,

216
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,170
she is the wife
of the leading presidential candidate.

217
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:53,590
She's also the prime suspect.

218
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:56,760
Request the warrant again.

219
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,514
There's a way to get it.

220
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,434
Twenty-four years ago,

221
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,980
my son went to the lake
with his grandfather

222
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,483
and never came back.

223
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,445
We were unable to find his body,

224
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:17,489
and we couldn't…

225
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:20,826
accept our child's death.

226
00:19:22,286 --> 00:19:23,120
So,

227
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,081
we couldn't register his death.

228
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,043
Then, one day,

229
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,546
at the fishing spot my son used to visit,

230
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:36,216
we met a child who had grown up there
without parents or even a name.

231
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,051
He's the Sa-eon who's with us now.

232
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,514
Sa-eon was the same age as our son,

233
00:19:43,974 --> 00:19:45,309
and to us,

234
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:47,936
it felt like fate.

235
00:19:56,778 --> 00:19:58,030
- Is it this way?
- Yes.

236
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:02,451
I'm Jang Hyeok-jin with HBC.
I have a question.

237
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:06,413
Why didn't your biological son
search for his parents,

238
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,209
and why is he seeking revenge
against Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon?

239
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:12,127
You can ask questions later…

240
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,420
It's fine.

241
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,131
I'll answer your question.

242
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:18,884
Among people,

243
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:23,305
there are rumors that my son
threatened Spokesperson Paik

244
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:26,308
and made death threats.

245
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:28,185
But they are not true.

246
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,147
My son has not been
in a sound state of mind

247
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,149
since the lake accident--

248
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,652
The blackmail and murder threats
are not true?

249
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,155
There's audio of your son's voice
and phone conversation recorded

250
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,116
on the spokesperson's dashcam
during Hong Hee-joo's kidnapping.

251
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,159
That's not all.

252
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,911
There are testimonies linking him

253
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:49,331
to the Sinil Childcare Center
abduction and murder cases.

254
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,458
Shall we hear it?

255
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,086
<i>I first saw him</i>

256
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,005
<i>near the Presidential Office last year.</i>

257
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,258
What is that?

258
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,595
A statement from the suspect's accomplice.
Let's listen further.

259
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,811
It was the first time

260
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,980
I'd seen someone with such animosity

261
00:21:13,063 --> 00:21:14,439
<i>toward Paik Sa-eon.</i>

262
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,357
Damn it!

263
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,025
Get him out of here.

264
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,361
Paik Sa-eon, get out here!

265
00:21:20,529 --> 00:21:21,947
Paik Sa-eon!

266
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:24,866
What's going on?

267
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,036
That man kept insisting
on meeting the spokesperson,

268
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:31,164
- trying to barge in without permission.
- Let go of me, bastards!

269
00:21:32,416 --> 00:21:34,418
I'll be back!

270
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,211
I promise!

271
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:40,674
I'll kill Paik Sa-eon myself!

272
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,017
<i>I wondered, "Is he a victim too?"</i>

273
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:55,564
<i>"Will I be able to</i>
<i>make use of his hatred?"</i>

274
00:21:56,690 --> 00:22:00,193
I followed him around for a few days
to see if we shared the same goal.

275
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:02,112
That's when

276
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,198
I saw him head to an important location.

277
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,117
An important location?

278
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,674
<i>He knew where the orphaned children</i>
<i>and my brother had gone missing.</i>

279
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:24,551
<i>That's why…</i>

280
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:27,763
<i>I was sure he was a victim like me.</i>

281
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,897
<i>Who are you?</i>

282
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:41,359
<i>Why do you want to take revenge</i>
<i>on Paik Sa-eon?</i>

283
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:47,407
<i>He said he grew up at the fishing spot.</i>

284
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,284
<i>Paik Jang-ho</i>

285
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,204
<i>brought the bodies of the victims</i>
<i>his grandson had killed</i>

286
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:53,705
<i>to the owner of the fishing spot…</i>

287
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,373
Take care of it!

288
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,463
One day, just because
he saw his grandson's face,

289
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,799
Paik Jang-ho tried to drown him.

290
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:06,551
Since then,
he's been living in an impaired state.

291
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:07,928
He said he wanted revenge

292
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:11,056
on the Paik family
for making him that way.

293
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,225
It was all a lie, though.

294
00:23:16,144 --> 00:23:18,063
Sure. Take it.

295
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,440
The police already have it.

296
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,733
Now, everyone!

297
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,695
Two people are missing at the moment,
and their fate is unknown.

298
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,738
Right now,

299
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,575
we shouldn't be swayed
by baseless rumors or fake news…

300
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:36,414
How can I help you?

301
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:41,419
Are you Shim Kyu-jin?

302
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,675
I am.

303
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:51,680
I'm Detective Kang Hyeong-cheol
from the Violent Crimes Unit.

304
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,767
You're under arrest
as a suspect in a murder case.

305
00:23:57,561 --> 00:23:58,728
What are you saying?

306
00:23:59,437 --> 00:24:00,772
- Wait!
- Shim Kyu-jin…

307
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,441
You have the right to remain silent

308
00:24:04,025 --> 00:24:05,861
and the right to an attorney.

309
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:07,946
Anything you say can

310
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,282
and will be used against you
in a court of law.

311
00:24:10,907 --> 00:24:12,200
- Take her.
- Move!

312
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,493
- Move aside.
- Wait!

313
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,220
HEE-JOO

314
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:33,221
SPEAKER

315
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:37,726
<i>The phone you called is turned off.</i>
<i>You'll be directed to voicemail.</i>

316
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,853
<i>Additional fees may apply after the beep.</i>

317
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,484
I…

318
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:51,573
wanted you to live
a different life from mine.

319
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,700
To live without hardship,

320
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:55,744
marry into a wealthy family,

321
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,538
wear beautiful clothes,
and indulge in luxury.

322
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,499
That's the life I wanted for you.

323
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:05,545
I thought it was for your own good, but…

324
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:11,426
But no matter how hard I try,

325
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,179
I can't remember it.

326
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,390
I don't think I ever saw it.

327
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,937
Your smile, Hee-joo.

328
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:41,581
Why are you doing nothing?

329
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,084
You should be doing something!

330
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:45,335
Why?

331
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:48,296
Are you afraid that stepping forward
will expose the deal you made

332
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,006
with Chairman Paik 20 years ago?

333
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:52,342
Fine.

334
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:55,095
If you can't do it, I will.

335
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:58,098
This tragedy between our two families.

336
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,684
The world deserves to know
why it happened.

337
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:02,477
Will doing that…

338
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:04,938
change anything?

339
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,023
What will change if we do nothing?

340
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:11,611
You saw what happened when you did nothing

341
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,990
after losing your son 20 years ago!

342
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,410
Honey!

343
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,996
What does this mean?

344
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:21,997
What's wrong?

345
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:25,166
PAIK UI-YONG'S WIFE ARRESTED FOR MURDER

346
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,168
What… For murder?

347
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,504
Who did this wench kill?

348
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:32,882
She didn't, right?

349
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:34,968
Not Hee-joo, right?

350
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:51,443
So,

351
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:54,362
has a body been found or something?

352
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,325
- What body?
- You said it was a murder charge.

353
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:02,787
Didn't you bring me here
because I killed someone?

354
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,914
Before that,

355
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,503
are you prepared to lose your badge?

356
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,381
I could get you fired
for defamation or abuse of power,

357
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,717
if I wanted to.

358
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,262
Have we found a body?

359
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,725
Do you think you're here for murder

360
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:26,102
of the missing Hong Hee-joo?

361
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,174
Do you admit to the murder charge?

362
00:27:57,717 --> 00:27:58,718
How…

363
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,596
did you get this?

364
00:28:33,002 --> 00:28:34,754
Grandfather's signet ring.

365
00:28:34,838 --> 00:28:38,425
He gave it to me a few days
before he passed away.

366
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:42,345
<i>A few days later,</i>

367
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:45,181
<i>I returned it to him.</i>

368
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:49,561
<i>I told him it wasn't right</i>

369
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,439
<i>for me to take it then.</i>

370
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,533
<i>That's when the video was taken.</i>

371
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,953
Right before Grandfather passed away,

372
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,080
that moment of truth.

373
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:14,461
BACKGROUND CHECK
SHIM KYU-JIN

374
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:27,682
Kyu-jin.

375
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,560
You've gone through a lot…

376
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,355
living as my daughter-in-law.

377
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,107
Now…

378
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:40,445
you're asking for forgiveness?

379
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:42,781
Forgiveness?

380
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,161
Are you talking about…

381
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,873
the sin of sending your son to his death

382
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,292
with my own hands?

383
00:29:54,375 --> 00:29:55,752
There's one more.

384
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,171
The sin…

385
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,882
of replacing my son with yours.

386
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,218
So,

387
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,888
you knew all along.

388
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,348
I didn't at first.

389
00:30:10,683 --> 00:30:13,436
As soon as my son died,
you brought an orphan

390
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:18,066
and shoved him into my arms,
telling me to raise him as Sa-eon.

391
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:22,654
But as I watched that child
become more and more like you,

392
00:30:23,363 --> 00:30:24,781
I saw

393
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,159
how lovingly you gazed at him

394
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:30,578
and how proud you were of him…

395
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:33,122
I couldn't help but know.

396
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:39,712
The joy and glory that comes with raising
a child should have been mine,

397
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:42,841
but you enjoyed it instead of me.

398
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:45,426
No.

399
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:50,181
I spared you the pain

400
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:55,436
and tragedy you would have faced

401
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,147
if your child had lived.

402
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,236
Until the very end,

403
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:08,950
you still won't ask for forgiveness.

404
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:16,749
Then,

405
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:20,753
I'll do it for you.

406
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,973
Forgive me, Father.

407
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,503
People…

408
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,715
tend to tell the truth

409
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,927
when the final moment comes.

410
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,929
That's why I kept this.

411
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,640
For the moment

412
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:16,643
when your lifelong secret
finally comes to light.

413
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:17,852
You are…

414
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,481
indeed Paik Jang-ho's son.

415
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,944
So, you'll make me pay the price
for killing your father.

416
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,074
I didn't record it for him.

417
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:34,535
I've been saving this for the day

418
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:38,456
the ugly truth of this family is exposed.

419
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,542
But I never imagined

420
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,087
I'd have to use it

421
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,172
not to ruin someone

422
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,466
but to save someone.

423
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,013
Mother.

424
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,391
Now, tell me.

425
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,518
Where's Hee-joo?

426
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,269
What did you do with her?

427
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:04,273
The police already have your phone
and dashcam.

428
00:33:04,941 --> 00:33:08,027
It'll work in your favor if you confess
before the evidence comes out.

429
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:10,530
You know that better than anyone.

430
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,622
OVERALL PROGRESS

431
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:29,966
CONNECTING TO ACQUISITION PROCESS

432
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,262
But…

433
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,264
I'm curious about something.

434
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,937
Fine.

435
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,939
Let's say I had her kidnapped.

436
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,360
But what you really want to find
isn't her body,

437
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:52,447
it's her alive, isn't it?

438
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,036
So tell me.

439
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:02,498
Is there any reason
I should keep her alive?

440
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:05,043
I'm not keeping her as a hostage,

441
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:07,253
so why would I keep her alive?

442
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:11,257
If it were you, would you have
bothered keeping her alive?

443
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,854
Yes, Professor. I found them.

444
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,525
What should I do with Hee-joo?

445
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:11,984
What?

446
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,153
I understand.

447
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,379
<i>If it were you,</i>

448
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,508
you would've kept her alive.

449
00:35:36,467 --> 00:35:38,094
For me.

450
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:39,720
For you?

451
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:43,891
You said it before.

452
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:48,604
The pain of not knowing
whether he was dead or alive,

453
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:53,276
struggling, pounding your chest,
crying and crying.

454
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:56,654
Whenever a body was found
floating in the water,

455
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:58,990
you ran barefoot in that agony.

456
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,535
You said it was my turn now.

457
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,620
Right.

458
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,581
I did.

459
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,126
That wouldn't have been enough for you.

460
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,837
You would've gone even further.

461
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:17,800
You would have looked for a way
to torment me,

462
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,304
the son of Paik Jang-ho,

463
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,807
until the very end.

464
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,647
How's it going?

465
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:33,900
- We have security footage.
- Pull it up.

466
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,153
The one on the right.

467
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:38,779
Zoom in.

468
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,233
You haven't eaten anything for days.

469
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:20,196
Are you planning to starve to death?

470
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,034
Why?

471
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:33,501
I could've had you killed.

472
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:35,670
Instead,

473
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:39,757
I brought you here and saved your life.

474
00:37:43,594 --> 00:37:45,221
So why are you trying to die?

475
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,557
Because I know what you're up to.

476
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,729
What I'm up to?

477
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,566
What's that?

478
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:01,821
He's probably searching for me
like crazy right now.

479
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,202
One year.

480
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:10,037
Two years.

481
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,665
And then, after about ten years…

482
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,920
he'll probably give up,

483
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,300
thinking I'm dead.

484
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:25,928
He'll just come to accept it.

485
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,558
Then, one day,
after more than 20 years have passed…

486
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:35,938
You want him…

487
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,315
…to eventually find out,

488
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:39,442
after all these years…

489
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,570
…that his beloved, whom he thought
was dead, was actually alive.

490
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:46,449
Then, I'll mourn the days
we couldn't be together.

491
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,908
Filled with regret

492
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,703
and sorrow,

493
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,873
he will beat his chest in despair.

494
00:38:58,252 --> 00:38:59,670
For me,

495
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,174
you would've prepared that final pain.

496
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,303
If it were you.

497
00:39:11,974 --> 00:39:12,933
We found Hong Hee-joo.

498
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:21,984
- Check the address and move quickly!
- Yes, sir!

499
00:39:24,737 --> 00:39:25,821
SEONGNANG POLICE STATION

PROFESSOR SHIM KYU-JIN ARRESTED

<i>anything happens to me,</i>

take care of the rest, Mr. Min.

504
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,643
Save my son.

505
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:12,261
<i>And</i>

506
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,638
kill her.

507
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:33,782
Please…

508
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:36,410
Hee-joo, hold on.

509
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,334
Ms. Hee-joo!

510
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,005
Run away.

511
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:31,924
Hurry.

512
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:36,220
NO ENTRY

513
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:43,852
<i>If it was for you,</i>

514
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:48,357
<i>I thought I wouldn't mind dying.</i>

515
00:42:59,994 --> 00:43:00,911
<i>But…</i>

516
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:03,581
<i>I miss you.</i>

517
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,844
<i>I wasn't afraid of dying,</i>

518
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,975
<i>but the thought of never seeing you again</i>
<i>was terrifying.</i>

519
00:43:28,188 --> 00:43:29,023
Are you outside?

520
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,067
Who are you?

521
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,612
Open the door.

522
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,533
Open it.

523
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:44,330
Open it right now!

524
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,674
Do you

525
00:43:56,842 --> 00:43:59,386
want to play with me?

526
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:02,389
Let's play.

527
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,728
There's a lot of fun stuff here.

528
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:10,230
Let's play with these.

529
00:44:15,903 --> 00:44:18,322
Let's play!

530
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,058
Stop!

531
00:45:02,908 --> 00:45:04,743
When I get out of here,

532
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,412
I'm going to kill you!

533
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,873
Open it! Open the door!

534
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,377
- Open the door!
- Open it.

535
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:18,465
I'm going to kill you
when I get out of here!

536
00:45:21,218 --> 00:45:22,886
- Open it!
- I saw everything.

537
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,889
You two exchanged glances.

538
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:26,974
Don't move!

539
00:45:27,057 --> 00:45:28,684
- Don't move!
- What are you doing?

540
00:45:28,767 --> 00:45:30,144
What are you doing?

541
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,898
<i>Something felt off, so I followed you.</i>

542
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,067
- Who knew you'd come here?
- Open it!

543
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,821
Who knew you'd hide him here?

544
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,739
Open the door!

545
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,783
Now.

546
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,744
I will pay

547
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,956
for my actions myself.

548
00:45:52,541 --> 00:45:53,459
Open…

549
00:45:56,128 --> 00:45:57,129
that door.

550
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:59,715
Open the door!

551
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:59,191
It's been a while, Father.

552
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:01,944
What's this for?

553
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,738
Are you going to shoot me?

554
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:10,452
<i>He…</i>

555
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:15,249
takes after you a lot.

556
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:23,882
Mr. Paik!

557
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:33,183
It was great to see you.

558
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:34,685
Goodbye.

559
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,312
Father.

560
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:16,685
Sis.

561
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,525
Sis!

562
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,658
Why did you leave me behind?

563
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,203
Let's play some more!

564
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,273
Help. Help me…

565
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,785
I found you.

566
00:49:44,439 --> 00:49:45,482
Hee-joo.

567
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:01,998
Hee-joo.

568
00:50:15,762 --> 00:50:16,596
Are you okay?

569
00:50:17,222 --> 00:50:18,181
Are you hurt?

570
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:19,182
I'm okay.

571
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,023
Let's go.

572
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:36,783
Let's go home.

573
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,535
It's all over now.

574
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:40,579
It's not over.

575
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:45,584
He's nearby, and he has a gun.

576
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:47,502
Get out of here.

577
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,963
We'll search the area and arrest him.

578
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:51,840
Thank you.

579
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:01,600
Okay.

580
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,186
I'm going to follow the spokesperson.

581
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:06,313
The rest of you split up
and search the area.

582
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:10,442
Be careful. The suspect is armed.
Request backup from the nearby precinct!

583
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:11,651
- Yes, sir!
- Yes, sir!

584
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,210
Hee-joo, you have to stay awake.

585
00:51:29,002 --> 00:51:30,337
Let's go to the hospital.

586
00:51:31,171 --> 00:51:32,088
Just hold on.

587
00:52:14,965 --> 00:52:16,091
Where are you going?

588
00:52:17,342 --> 00:52:18,760
Let's play.

589
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,643
Paik Sa-eon, get out of the car.

590
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:37,445
Hee-joo.

591
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:40,115
Listen to me.

592
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:43,285
Don't get out of this car. Stay here.

593
00:52:44,286 --> 00:52:45,495
No, don't go.

594
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,497
Get out!

595
00:52:49,207 --> 00:52:50,876
No! No…

596
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,546
I have to end this.

597
00:52:55,922 --> 00:52:57,007
Don't come out.

598
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:20,030
This is between us.
Don't drag her into this anymore.

599
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:27,913
Do you think you won?

600
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,542
But…

601
00:53:33,209 --> 00:53:34,544
did you…

602
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:37,756
really win?

603
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,633
I never wanted to beat you.

604
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:41,509
I told you.

605
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:44,220
I didn't want to take what's yours.

606
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,642
Yeah.

607
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:50,560
You just

608
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,856
want to live happily ever after
with Hong Hee-joo.

609
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,941
But…

610
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,569
do you remember what I said before?

611
00:54:00,278 --> 00:54:01,196
I told you

612
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:03,073
I wanted

613
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:08,328
to see you suffer properly.

614
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:12,165
Aren't you guilty of anything?

615
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,045
Of course, you are.

616
00:54:18,380 --> 00:54:19,589
You're the son…

617
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,051
of Paik Jang-ho,

618
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:25,011
a man full of sins.

619
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,734
What's that?

620
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,614
Suspect sighted.

621
00:54:45,281 --> 00:54:46,282
Requesting backup.

622
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,270
Yeah!

623
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:42,232
That's it.

624
00:56:52,951 --> 00:56:54,786
That is the face

625
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:57,247
I wanted to see from you.

626
00:57:02,585 --> 00:57:03,503
Put the gun down!

627
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:28,653
<i>Hong Hee-joo,</i>

628
00:57:29,487 --> 00:57:31,114
<i>do you like being married to me</i>

629
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:32,991
<i>or not?</i>

630
00:57:35,702 --> 00:57:36,870
If you don't hate it,

631
00:57:37,662 --> 00:57:40,665
how about we slowly
get to know each other better?

632
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,557
I'd like that.

633
00:58:03,855 --> 00:58:05,231
I like you.

634
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,196
What?

635
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,079
I've liked you

636
00:58:21,331 --> 00:58:23,208
for a long time now.

637
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,461
Since when?

638
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,172
When we were kids.

639
00:58:39,474 --> 00:58:40,934
<i>Since the moment</i>

640
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,520
you carried me on your back.

641
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:47,899
<i>I should've told you</i>

642
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,486
<i>when you were still by my side.</i>

643
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:55,907
<i>I shouldn't have hidden it</i>
<i>or kept it a secret.</i>

644
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,284
<i>I should've told you</i>

645
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,746
<i>that I've liked you for such a long time.</i>

646
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:35,446
It's so pretty.

647
01:00:26,331 --> 01:00:28,291
- Something's burning!
- What?

648
01:00:30,418 --> 01:00:31,377
No!

649
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,296
My steak!

650
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,548
No!

651
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,384
Oh, no.

652
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,094
What do we do?

653
01:00:40,928 --> 01:00:41,929
Look at the smoke!

654
01:00:42,805 --> 01:00:45,224
- It's on fire!
- It's all burnt. What do we do?

655
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,726
I can't see the steak!

656
01:00:47,435 --> 01:00:48,603
It's okay.

657
01:01:02,909 --> 01:01:03,910
