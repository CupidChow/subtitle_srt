1
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:46,963
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,883
I've never been…

3
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,303
more curious about a man before.

4
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,728
Forget about getting arrested, 406.

5
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,355
I promise,

6
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,692
I'm going to catch you.

7
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,080
Wait…

8
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:24,000
Am I screwed, or did he fall for it?

9
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:33,027
What… What is he doing?

10
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,825
Are you hiding something from me?

11
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,869
Hiding something?

12
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:43,204
Give me the phone.

13
00:02:44,622 --> 00:02:45,540
The phone?

14
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,167
Give it to me.

15
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:03,850
I want you to answer my questions.

16
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:09,731
Yesterday,

17
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:11,858
was there a car accident?

18
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,322
What time?

19
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,825
Between 6 and 7 p.m.

20
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:25,413
So…

21
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:28,166
there really was an accident.

22
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:31,085
Were you hurt?

23
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,867
What's this?

24
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,455
I asked you what this is!

25
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,750
No.

26
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,877
You don't have to answer.

27
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,176
Who was he?

28
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,844
Did you see his face?

29
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,224
His face was covered,
so I couldn't see it.

30
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,522
Tell me…

31
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:35,441
what that bastard did.

32
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,945
Did he threaten you with a knife?

33
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,196
That he would kill you?

34
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,162
If something like that happened,

35
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,415
why didn't you tell me?

36
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,920
You said to call back
when there's a corpse.

37
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,216
Did you see anyone suspicious just now?

38
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,678
Did anyone follow,
approach, or talk to you?

39
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:12,478
Make sure you keep
your bodyguard with you.

40
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,942
And get checked at the hospital.

41
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:24,324
He doesn't know,

42
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:25,450
right?

43
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,052
SECURITY TEAM 1 LEE JEONG-WON

44
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,849
Hong Hee-joo's going home.
Come to the second floor.

45
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:56,856
How did it go?

46
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,024
It won't be easy.

47
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,693
The IP was bouncing around
in less than ten minutes.

48
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,570
I think it's operating organizationally.

49
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,905
-An organization?
-Yes.

50
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,698
Do you have any ideas?

51
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,659
He knew more about me than I expected.

52
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,161
Things only family knows.

53
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:14,165
Secure the lists of the guests
and service providers for the event.

54
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,209
The embassy event? Is he there now?

55
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,086
He's pretending to be.

56
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,047
I'll send you part of the recorded call.

57
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,590
Try to remove the modulator.

58
00:06:24,175 --> 00:06:25,468
As soon as possible.

59
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,679
EPISODE 2

60
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:31,099
Say something, Paik Sa-eon!

61
00:06:31,766 --> 00:06:32,892
What do you want?

62
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:35,478
Yeah, good job.

63
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,230
That's the correct answer.

64
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,148
Tell me…

65
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,734
what you want.

66
00:06:45,321 --> 00:06:46,697
What do you want?

67
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,117
Yeah, good job.

68
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,327
That's the correct answer.

69
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:53,162
Tell me…

70
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,373
what you want.

71
00:06:58,292 --> 00:06:59,210
He's scared.

72
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,088
Paik Sa-eon is scared.

73
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,560
I guess it makes him angry
when someone touches his things.

74
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,482
Yeah, Hong Hee-joo
really could've ended up dead.

75
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,734
The car rolled on the slippery road!

76
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,618
Why do I care?

77
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,790
I've had this for two days now.

78
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,501
He must be looking for it.

79
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,627
I have to hurry.

80
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:52,305
Hong Hee-joo?

81
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:02,023
Your car key.

82
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,736
Is it here?

83
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:18,080
What are you doing?

84
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,686
What does he want with the car?

85
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,356
What is he looking for?

86
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:17,557
No way.

87
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,064
That asshole.

88
00:09:25,147 --> 00:09:28,401
I have something to say to him,
so call him back now!

89
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,634
I'm glad you're here.

90
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,094
What happened?

91
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,471
About what?

92
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:00,141
Look at the car.
How did you drive it back?

93
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,498
I called a tow truck.

94
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,252
And the dashcam?

95
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:31,964
Why…

96
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,175
isn't anything recorded?

97
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,719
There's nothing on it?

98
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:39,221
Thank goodness.

99
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,570
You should be…

100
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:56,405
careful.

101
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,573
Sorry about that.

102
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,209
I'll get you a new car.

103
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,045
But don't go to work from tomorrow on,
and stay at home.

104
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,841
I can't do that. I have to go to court.

105
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:18,386
Court?

106
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,432
I have to go interpret.

107
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:24,975
Alone?

108
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,270
I'm going with the director.

109
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,149
Also, I want to keep working.

110
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,615
Your mother told me to quit,

111
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,368
but I'd like to keep working, please.

112
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,379
Then keep the security staff
while you work…

113
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,925
Don't make it obvious.

114
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:14,400
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER PARK DO-JAE

115
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,779
Yes, sir.

116
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:21,907
It's a personal request,
and it needs to be handled discreetly.

117
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,617
Can I entrust you with it?

118
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,744
Of course. Please, go ahead.

119
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,497
There's nothing on the dashcam
from yesterday's accident.

120
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,999
See if you can restore it.

121
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,751
And check the traffic cameras
according to the route

122
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,670
between 6 to 7 p.m. yesterday.

123
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,880
Yes, sir.

124
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:45,514
When will you join us?

125
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,601
Your father's waiting.

126
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,565
HYESEONG DAILY NEWS CHOI YEONG-JIN

127
00:12:56,108 --> 00:12:56,942
Right.

128
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,737
I told her to quit working.

129
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:04,241
During the election period,
tell her to keep quiet and stay low.

130
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:08,913
I don't know why
I have to be bothered by her.

131
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:12,208
This marriage should've never happened.

132
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,252
Aren't we the ones who wanted
to establish ties

133
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:19,757
with Chungwoon,
even if that meant switching the bride?

134
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:24,553
Father was able to get this far
thanks to Chungwoon Daily News

135
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,889
burying his scandals.

136
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:34,730
Anyway,

137
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,651
who else knows about this marriage?

138
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,819
What?

139
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,404
Father, you,

140
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,366
Hee-joo's father, Hee-joo's mother,
Hee-joo…

141
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,660
And Hong In-a.

142
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:51,956
No one else knows about it, but he does.

143
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,707
That means…

144
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,417
Why do you ask that?

145
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:58,754
HYESEONG DAILY NEWS CHOI YEONG-JIN

146
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:06,136
It seems you've developed a bad habit.

147
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,349
I'm getting calls that bother me.

148
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,102
You still have a long way to go.

149
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:18,315
I've taught you that impatience
is a barrier to communication.

150
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:21,443
But when you get those calls,

151
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,196
you look ready to go on a rampage.

152
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:28,701
Then, why don't you give me some advice?

153
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:34,790
As our country's first negotiation expert
and a former criminal psychologist.

154
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,669
It burst with a bang!

155
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:41,755
The witness' precious testicle.

156
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,550
Testicle? Did his ball burst?

157
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:48,971
Your Honor, the witness now must live
with the irrecoverable loss

158
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:52,516
caused by the defendant's attack
with a ladle.

159
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,559
I'm dying!

160
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,020
What a load of bullshit!

161
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:00,316
You fell on your own and burst it!

162
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,942
Why is that my fault?

163
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,903
You were wasted that day, as usual.

164
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,488
And that happened
while you tried to hit me.

165
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:11,035
How dare you lie in front of the judge,
you rotten bastard?

166
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,537
Interpreter.

167
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,414
It's not the defendant's turn to speak.

168
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:16,957
Also,

169
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,544
try to tone down the interpretation.

170
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:24,089
Oh, sure. Duly noted, Your Honor.

171
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,885
Counsel, proceed with
the cross-examination.

172
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:28,802
Yes, Your Honor.

173
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:34,224
Witness,

174
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:38,228
do you often drink alcohol?

175
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:40,105
Not often.

176
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,816
You don't have to interpret.
I don't want to know.

177
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,278
I don't talk with that man.

178
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,574
-I only have fistfights with him.
-I only drank a little.

179
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:52,326
I don't remember.

180
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,038
Isn't it funny?

181
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,210
As a deaf person, the person
I can't communicate with is him.

182
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,003
That's because that woman

183
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:06,423
kept nagging me and wouldn't let me drink.

184
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,928
And he's my husband
I've lived with for decades.

185
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:13,013
I just pushed her.

186
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,599
After tracking all of the routes,

187
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:17,935
this is the only footage
where he was spotted.

188
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:19,353
Is that all?

189
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:26,068
From here on,

190
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:29,321
it's outside the cameras' coverage,
so nothing after this.

191
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:33,951
And the embassy?

192
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,495
Without an official notice,

193
00:16:36,578 --> 00:16:39,373
we can't get the guest list,
so I called the security company.

194
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:41,917
And most external employees
were part-timers.

195
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,129
In short,

196
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:49,675
you couldn't find anything useful?

197
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,301
I'm sorry, sir.

198
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:55,639
Should we request police cooperation?

199
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:58,434
Probably not.

200
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:01,770
I just think it's serious
since he threatened your wife.

201
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,022
Mr. Park.

202
00:17:03,105 --> 00:17:04,690
Have you ever seen my wife?

203
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,026
No, I haven't.

204
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,281
Have I ever spoken of my wife, even once?

205
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,699
No, you haven't.

206
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:16,452
The entire nation
doesn't know about my wife.

207
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,828
They're just curious.

208
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:20,956
So, what do you think will happen

209
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:23,167
if I go public with this?

210
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,295
I apologize. I was thoughtless.

211
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,762
Hong Hee-joo's court schedule is over.

212
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:42,352
Take her home now.

213
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:48,275
Yes, sir.

214
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,040
Excuse me!

215
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,291
Can you help us?

216
00:18:08,462 --> 00:18:10,130
No, stop! Let go!

217
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,216
Come on, come help!

218
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,609
-Please calm down.
-You damn woman!

219
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,820
-What's your problem?
-Calm down.

220
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,281
Goodness.

221
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:19,658
That's better.

222
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,328
Thank you so much.

223
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,621
Thank you so much.

224
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:28,292
But where did Hee-joo go?

225
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,424
Ms. Hong Hee-joo?

226
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,814
She's not here. Find her now!

227
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,376
Here's a list of posts from the past month

228
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,587
with high approval ratings
from the public.

229
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,672
First, we'll start from the top…

230
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:18,050
or the lowest?

231
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,385
Go ahead. Continue.

232
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,013
THE PUBLIC'S TOP 10 PICK LIST

233
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:28,060
I'm sorry. I'm at the courthouse,
but I can't locate Ms. Hong.

234
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:30,020
What do you mean you can't locate her?

235
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:38,695
She went to the restroom, and I lost her.

236
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,323
I'm sorry.

237
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:47,412
Find her quickly! Request support
from the courthouse if you have to.

238
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:52,000
The current hot issue
is the punishment for dating violence.

239
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,169
The penalties are too light…

240
00:20:54,253 --> 00:20:55,337
I found her.

241
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,714
She's with some man.

242
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,715
A man?

243
00:20:58,799 --> 00:20:59,675
Excuse me?

244
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,592
A man?

245
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,012
Yes, mostly men.

246
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:06,932
Usually, men do it
to their girlfriends or…

247
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,476
Who is he? What does he look like?

248
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,440
Sorry about earlier.

249
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,234
Did I scare you?

250
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,035
SECURITY TEAM LEE JEONG-WON

251
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:38,255
What was I thinking
hovering around the women's restroom?

252
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,466
I saw you come out of the courtroom,
but I wasn't sure.

253
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:43,844
But what brings you here?

254
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:46,305
I had to appear as a witness.
What about you?

255
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,764
Did you come to interpret?

256
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,822
Many individuals commit crimes
out of resentment.

257
00:22:03,905 --> 00:22:05,198
This is him.

258
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,950
I think he's an acquaintance.

259
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,453
Not only are there no provisions in place,

260
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,205
but the legal systems also
fail to protect the victims…

261
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:15,334
Which is why such crimes
continue to persist.

262
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,669
Furthermore…

263
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:21,340
Well, many cases are classified
as non-prosecutable offenses.

264
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:23,133
These result in minor penalties,

265
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:25,969
and the victim fears retaliatory crimes…

266
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:27,596
He's got a good physique.

267
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,473
He's good-looking.

268
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,397
Don't take photos.

269
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:40,817
I asked you to guard her,
not to spy on her.

270
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:46,156
He asked about his appearance.
What was I supposed to say?

271
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,366
That he has two eyes, a nose, and a mouth?

272
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,576
Jeez.

273
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,287
He's totally my type.

274
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:00,128
After you suddenly cut off contact
three years ago,

275
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,130
I looked everywhere for you.

276
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:06,218
But no one knew anything.

277
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,681
Then one day, I saw you on the news.

278
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,270
"Sign language interpreter, Hong Hee-joo."

279
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,149
It was great to see you.

280
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,860
I'm sorry I didn't contact you.

281
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,158
Hee-joo,

282
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,952
you're doing well, right?

283
00:23:36,331 --> 00:23:39,000
You're still good at signing.

284
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,420
That's how I can talk to you.

285
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:47,175
Right.

286
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,094
Starting this week,

287
00:23:49,761 --> 00:23:52,639
I'm going to the station
where you interpret the news.

288
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,683
I've taken on a new program.

289
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,851
JI SANG-WOO

290
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,520
What type of program?

291
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,397
It's called "Crime Report."

292
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,107
It covers crime cases.

293
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,069
There's a cold case that I personally
want to solve. So I agreed to do it.

294
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:06,987
Wait.

295
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:09,906
Give me your number.

296
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,242
I'll call when I go to the station.

297
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,257
It was great to see you.

298
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:44,816
In addition to strengthening
related penalty laws,

299
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,776
experts have voiced
that integrated services

300
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,946
in psychology, healthcare,
and legal support should be provided.

301
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,866
Ms. Hong has returned home safely.

302
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:57,204
I'll provide additional reports
regarding the measures and penalties.

303
00:25:04,085 --> 00:25:04,920
Next.

304
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:06,338
Next. Okay.

305
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:08,506
Next, we discussed dating violence. Well…

306
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,134
This is about…

307
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,094
-school violence.
-Wait.

308
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,514
Let's discuss this first.

309
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:20,518
The sign language interpreter position
at the presidential office.

310
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,436
I see.

311
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,855
PRESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT
OF SIGN LANGUAGE INTERPRETER

312
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:24,856
This?

313
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,489
MOM
MISSED CALL

314
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,907
MOM
TEXT BACK OR PICK UP THE PHONE

315
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,909
I'M IN FRONT OF YOUR PLACE.
YOU'D BETTER…

316
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,252
Why didn't you pick up the phone
or go to the dermatologist?

317
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,880
Why do you never do what I ask you to?

318
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:53,635
Start taking these from today
and prepare your body.

319
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,470
And this.

320
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:12,696
What do you think?

321
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:14,614
It's work clothes.

322
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,867
You're pathetic.

323
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:21,454
Why do I still have to
bring things like this

324
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:23,331
and teach you everything?

325
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,334
Are you really a mother

326
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,752
and not a pimp?

327
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,504
What the hell are you saying?

328
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,339
Listen carefully.

329
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,009
When In-a ran away
and you agreed to be the sub,

330
00:26:34,092 --> 00:26:35,218
what did you say?

331
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,972
You daringly imposed a condition
about your father.

332
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,474
That he be put in a good nursing home.

333
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,353
That's only if you maintain this marriage

334
00:26:45,437 --> 00:26:47,814
and properly fulfill your duty
as Sa-eon's wife.

335
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,275
If anything goes wrong,

336
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:54,404
your father will be out
in the streets as soon as tomorrow.

337
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:56,156
Do you understand?

338
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:03,246
Yeah, that's how you are.

339
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:07,667
The moment your father is used
against you, you can't do anything.

340
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:11,755
She's right.

341
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,674
This is what a weakness is.

342
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:18,595
When someone touches it, you flinch,

343
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,723
tremble uncontrollably,

344
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:26,269
and desperately try to defend it.

345
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,078
I'll try my best.

346
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:03,223
But, Mom,

347
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,350
I'm so curious.

348
00:28:06,768 --> 00:28:08,978
Once I successfully escape this prison,

349
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,648
what expression will you have?

350
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,700
It's a misconception that a strong stance
increases your chances of winning

351
00:28:22,784 --> 00:28:24,828
and a weak one does the opposite
in negotiations.

352
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:29,207
Getting a serial killer to talk
ultimately relies on building rapport.

353
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,335
In a negotiation without trust,

354
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:33,711
there's no victory.

355
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:36,589
What about you?

356
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:40,009
How well do you understand your opponent?

357
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,008
Have you decided?

358
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,010
Is there a reason

359
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,763
for timing it perfectly?

360
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,723
That's up to me.

361
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,266
So?

362
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:30,685
Have you decided?

363
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,362
Will you put everything back or pay me?

364
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:43,281
Before that,

365
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,533
I'm curious about something.

366
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,327
Hong Hee-joo.

367
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,255
The entire nation thinks

368
00:29:59,923 --> 00:30:03,259
Hong In-a, the eldest daughter
of the chairman of Chungwoon, is my wife.

369
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,887
So where did you get

370
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,515
your information on Hong Hee-joo?

371
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,434
By any chance,

372
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,729
are you close to me?

373
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:20,026
Considering that no one knows
about this except for family,

374
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,195
you must be close to me.

375
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,154
No, wait!

376
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,824
What does that matter right now?

377
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:27,742
Come on, man.

378
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,744
You still don't get it, do you?

379
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,372
I'm going to bring you down.

380
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,124
I'm going to brand you
with a scarlet letter.

381
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,086
I know.

382
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,504
What?

383
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,300
Some crazy guy
crashed into Hong Hee-joo's car,

384
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:47,011
stabbed her headrest with a knife,
and left bruises

385
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:49,180
on her forehead, neck, and shoulders.

386
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:52,767
Let me be clear.

387
00:30:54,143 --> 00:30:56,938
There will be no compromise.

388
00:31:00,692 --> 00:31:02,026
Do you really think that?

389
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:06,155
I have something very interesting.

390
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,835
How's that? Can you see it?

391
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,671
Still no room for compromise?

392
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,217
What is this?

393
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:31,431
You're her husband,
and you can't recognize that?

394
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,602
Aren't you making it too obvious
that she's not your real wife?

395
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,186
I asked what this is.

396
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,564
Be straight with me.

397
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,149
It's Hong Hee-joo's…

398
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,402
thigh.

399
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,905
I won't say anything right now.

400
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,657
How I'll use this photo

401
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,910
and what kind of story I'll add to it…

402
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,245
I'll leave that to your imagination.

403
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,455
How do I know

404
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,583
that this is a photo of Hee-joo?

405
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,710
What a strange question.

406
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,004
You're supposed to be her husband.

407
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:05,715
Didn't you know Hee-joo
has a unique mole on her thigh?

408
00:32:12,513 --> 00:32:14,515
How could you not know?

409
00:32:15,141 --> 00:32:17,727
Were you just not interested, or…

410
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,979
have you never seen her naked?

411
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:33,493
406, are you married?

412
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:36,621
What?

413
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,039
Are you married?

414
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,708
Yeah, I mean, no!

415
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:44,921
When was your first time with a woman?

416
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:46,255
Excuse me? What?

417
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:47,799
I'm asking you a question.

418
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,094
Answer me, you perverted bastard.

419
00:32:51,177 --> 00:32:52,011
Pervert?

420
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:52,929
Yeah.

421
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,765
A pervert who uses a cheap fake photo

422
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:58,476
to fantasize about, harass,
and slander my wife.

423
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,937
I guess blackmail isn't enough,

424
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,564
so I'll add one more
to your list of offenses.

425
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:09,153
Article 13
of the Act of Sexual Violence Crimes,

426
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,197
obscenity crimes
using communication media.

427
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,241
Sexual violence?

428
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,826
If you want to threaten me,

429
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:17,495
then you'd better do your research on me.

430
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:20,498
I know her better than anyone.

431
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,834
Don't throw random things.

432
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,503
You know her well?

433
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,881
What do you know?
You're just pretending to be her husband.

434
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,258
It's not a fake photo.

435
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,968
You should check for yourself.

436
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:36,014
See if that's her thigh or not!
Check for yourself!

437
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,981
Wait…

438
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,402
What did I just say?

439
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,156
-Did you get the signal?
-Yes.

440
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:54,574
Exceeding ten minutes helped.

441
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,911
The presumed location
is Seocho, Gangnam, or Yongsan.

442
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,872
It's a rough estimate, but yes.

443
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,042
We will identify the suspect
based on the clues I provide.

444
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:07,170
When I asked him if he was married,
he changed his answer.

445
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:10,381
When flustered,
the first response is often the truth.

446
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,843
However, there's a chance
he's divorced recently

447
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,344
or considering it.

448
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,096
-Take a broad approach.
-Yes, sir.

449
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,849
And he was flustered
when I asked him a sexual question.

450
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:21,601
So he might have a prior.

451
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,479
Check all sex offenders
and search the dark web.

452
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,730
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

453
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:27,523
Yes, sir.

454
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,692
Also, find the source of this photo…

455
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,572
It's Hong Hee-joo's thigh.

456
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,740
Sir?

457
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,284
Never mind. Get started.

458
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:48,127
He seems really angry.

459
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:53,508
I must be crazy!

460
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:55,760
Check what? What?

461
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,973
But what? A fake photo?

462
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,394
Does he know how hard I worked
to take that photo?

463
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:51,107
"I know her better than anyone."

464
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,025
"Don't throw random things…"

465
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:55,778
What does he know?

466
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:56,714
What the heck?

467
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,179
Why is he coming?

468
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,222
The presidential office

469
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,892
will announce that they are recruiting
a sign language interpreter soon.

470
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,854
You said you wanted to keep working.

471
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,147
There are no privileges.

472
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,107
If you want to do it,

473
00:38:38,691 --> 00:38:40,401
earn your spot beside me.

474
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,658
The presidential office?

475
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:52,830
All of a sudden?

476
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:22,777
3 YEARS AGO

477
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:39,710
Did you make this?

478
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,505
Let's say we ate it.

479
00:39:43,589 --> 00:39:45,174
What's next?

480
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,258
Hong Hee-joo.

481
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:28,884
Look at me.

482
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,986
Do you want a tip?

483
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,285
Don't try to have any feelings for me.

484
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,328
Let it all go.

485
00:40:57,872 --> 00:41:00,583
You don't need to act like a puppet
in front of me.

486
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,335
Don't do everything your mother tells you.

487
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:11,886
Let me be clear.

488
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,054
You weren't part of my plan.

489
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,431
So, from now on,

490
00:41:16,348 --> 00:41:18,309
if you interfere or get in my way,

491
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,436
I won't let it slide.

492
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:11,779
How could he barge into my room
in the middle of the night like that?

493
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,917
But why didn't he check?

494
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,796
He didn't even ask me.

495
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:35,094
Why do I care?

496
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,099
Calm down.

497
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,268
I was just startled.

498
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:45,813
Just sleep.

499
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,170
Ahead of the presidential election,

500
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,756
the results of HBC's public opinion poll
are in.

501
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,634
Paik Ui-yong
of the Liberty and Justice Party

502
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:18,596
ranked first in the public opinion poll.

503
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:19,847
Did you see a ghost?

504
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,307
Why are you so surprised?

505
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,855
I'll go in the afternoon.

506
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,068
What about breakfast?

507
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,989
I never skip breakfast.

508
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:41,201
He's telling me
to make breakfast, isn't he?

509
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,296
No coffee on an empty stomach.

510
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:01,472
Cutting board.

511
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:12,858
Knife.

512
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,532
Pan.

513
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:28,457
Turn it on.

514
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:07,913
You'll get new guards.

515
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,833
I heard they lost you at the courthouse.

516
00:45:13,836 --> 00:45:14,670
That was…

517
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:20,592
Then what happened?

518
00:45:21,301 --> 00:45:22,136
What did you do?

519
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:28,767
A college friend.

520
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:30,978
A college friend?

521
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,441
Were you close?

522
00:45:39,778 --> 00:45:40,779
Are they trustworthy?

523
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:45,951
Is this friend someone you can trust?

524
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,889
And all this time, I thought…

525
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:10,350
you were quietly and obediently living
under my control.

526
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:14,480
Was I mistaken?

527
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:37,753
Eat it all.

528
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:44,968
ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER PARK DO-JAE

529
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,137
The preliminary voice analysis results
are in.

530
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:54,811
Did he make this for me?

531
00:46:59,107 --> 00:47:02,027
HE'S A GOOD PERSON.

532
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,987
I'LL ALWAYS BE WITH YOU!

533
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,697
MY YOUTH SHINES BECAUSE OF YOU!

534
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,218
Excuse me.

535
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,637
-It's him!
-He's here!

536
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,295
Are you okay?

537
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,387
What about you? Are you okay?

538
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,309
Yes.

539
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,227
That's hot.

540
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:20,397
JI SANG-WOO

541
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,026
Oh, my. You're the one
appearing on our show.

542
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,445
Yeah.

543
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,988
I came for the pre-interview.

544
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,032
And suffered a disaster.

545
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:32,034
Sorry about that.

546
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,410
No, don't say that.

547
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,953
Those fans are a nuisance.

548
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:36,872
Such a fuss.

549
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,791
Wait a second.

550
00:48:41,126 --> 00:48:42,836
"Fans are a nuisance"?

551
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:44,338
It's a fuss?

552
00:48:45,589 --> 00:48:46,423
I mean,

553
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:51,553
to catch music shows or pre-recordings,
you have to buy an album, join a fan club,

554
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:55,682
come early, wait in line, and keep waiting
if the recording is delayed.

555
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:57,726
It's not a fuss.

556
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,937
It should be called devotion.

557
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:04,941
Have you ever burned with passion
about anyone before?

558
00:49:06,943 --> 00:49:09,488
My arm's feeling pretty burned.

559
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:11,782
Oh, that…

560
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:13,950
Sorry about that.

561
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:19,581
If having a crush on someone is
somewhat similar to being someone's fan…

562
00:49:20,707 --> 00:49:23,377
Then, yes. I've done it before.

563
00:49:24,336 --> 00:49:26,588
What about you? Who are you a fan of?

564
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:29,508
Well…

565
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:31,468
He has a nice voice.

566
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:33,970
A singer?

567
00:49:36,056 --> 00:49:37,307
He's handsome.

568
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,308
An actor?

569
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,437
He's someone who's respected
and loved by the nation.

570
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,730
I'll leave it at that.

571
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,108
Anyway,

572
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:49,736
call me if you end up having to go
to the hospital.

573
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,540
NA YOU-RI
HBC ANCHOR

574
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,344
HEE-JOO

575
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,481
Come on, man.

576
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:28,483
You still don't get it, do you?

577
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,777
I'm going to bring you down.

578
00:50:31,570 --> 00:50:34,406
I'm going to brand you
with a scarlet letter.

579
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:42,956
It's hard to identify someone with this.

580
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:43,999
I'm sorry.

581
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,084
It's not a typical voice changer.

582
00:50:46,168 --> 00:50:47,419
The voice is encrypted.

583
00:50:47,502 --> 00:50:50,005
-We need time to decrypt--
-I don't care how.

584
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,048
Tell me when you get results.

585
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,425
Yes, sir.

586
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,845
We filtered through the records of sex
offenders and searched the dark web.

587
00:50:56,928 --> 00:51:00,599
I looked into vehicle 1575's dashcam,
and it was off at that time.

588
00:51:03,059 --> 00:51:03,894
But…

589
00:51:06,354 --> 00:51:07,189
Never mind.

590
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:08,732
What is it?

591
00:51:09,524 --> 00:51:12,319
I tried enhancing the quality
of the footage yesterday,

592
00:51:12,402 --> 00:51:14,029
and I found something strange.

593
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:19,868
It's this part.

594
00:51:22,871 --> 00:51:23,872
Stop.

595
00:51:23,955 --> 00:51:24,873
Rewind it.

596
00:51:27,375 --> 00:51:29,377
Here. Zoom in.

597
00:51:41,264 --> 00:51:44,059
He'll be so happy to see his daughter.

598
00:51:44,142 --> 00:51:46,561
He's been doing great lately.

599
00:51:47,729 --> 00:51:49,147
Our club's treasure!

600
00:51:49,231 --> 00:51:50,607
Our club's pride!

601
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,317
Let's give a round of applause!

602
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,111
Kim Yeon-hui!

603
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:56,112
Goodness!

604
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:03,161
Good grief.

605
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,458
Why would you pick today to do this?

606
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,335
Put this on now! Quickly!

607
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,922
I'm so sorry.

608
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:16,424
He was fine just this morning.

609
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,771
How many times have I told you?

610
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,732
You won't need to perform
at nightclubs again, Dad.

611
00:52:43,702 --> 00:52:45,245
There you go.

612
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,081
Is it good?

613
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,751
No matter what I bring,
you insist on eating that.

614
00:52:57,716 --> 00:52:58,550
Don't go.

615
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:03,388
Yeon-hui, I'll do better.

616
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,098
So please…

617
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,767
Please don't go, Yeon-hui.

618
00:53:12,397 --> 00:53:13,899
You should've said that…

619
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:18,361
when Mom packed her bags to leave.

620
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,700
Why didn't you say that then?

621
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:26,953
You made a living
with that mouth of yours all your life,

622
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:30,582
so you could've at least yelled
or cursed at her!

623
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,877
Or…

624
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:38,757
at least you could've kept me with you.

625
00:53:42,469 --> 00:53:46,264
Our daughter's dream
is to become an anchor.

626
00:53:47,223 --> 00:53:48,141
Isn't that cool?

627
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,560
So…

628
00:53:51,436 --> 00:53:53,939
raise Hee-joo well so she can be an anchor

629
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:57,651
at a proper broadcasting station

630
00:53:57,734 --> 00:53:59,110
and won't end up

631
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:01,988
in cheap nightclubs like I did.

632
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:04,032
Okay?

633
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:11,873
Is that why…

634
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:16,086
you sent me away?

635
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,595
But Dad…

636
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,812
Dad, the thing is…

637
00:54:36,272 --> 00:54:39,651
ever since I became Hong Hee-joo
instead of Na Hee-joo,

638
00:54:39,734 --> 00:54:42,612
I've never had a day of peace.

639
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,865
I pretend to be mute,
living in Hong In-a's shadow.

640
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:49,577
I don't remember who I am anymore.

641
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:55,208
I'm so sick of this. I want to quit.

642
00:54:57,419 --> 00:55:00,839
Dad!

643
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:22,485
Threats?

644
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:25,822
Wait.

645
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:28,533
A man sends a photo of the wife's naked--

646
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:29,826
She wasn't naked.

647
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:30,910
Either way.

648
00:55:30,994 --> 00:55:32,579
He sends a sleazy photo

649
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:36,124
and threatens the husband
to end it with his wife.

650
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:37,959
Yeah.

651
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:39,919
What does that sound like?

652
00:55:41,129 --> 00:55:42,756
It's obvious. I'm sure…

653
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,760
Hey.

654
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:47,886
Who is this about?

655
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,722
Don't ask. You're sure of what?

656
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,266
What do you think? It's obvious.

657
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:55,810
I'm certain…

658
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,146
it's an affair.

659
00:56:02,567 --> 00:56:04,944
I thought the car was forcibly taken,

660
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,821
but he got in very naturally.

661
00:56:06,905 --> 00:56:09,574
As if she opened the door for him.

662
00:56:51,825 --> 00:56:52,742
Hello…

663
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,416
What was that? Did he hang up?

664
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,502
PAIK SA-EON

665
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,256
Paik Sa-eon, I dare you to hang up again!

666
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,841
-I'm hanging up.
-Wait!

667
00:57:08,633 --> 00:57:10,927
Now it's hard to tell
who's more desperate.

668
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,764
I won't stay quiet if you act this way.

669
00:57:14,848 --> 00:57:16,015
Wait.

670
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:17,016
What?

671
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:20,353
If you want to talk to me that badly,

672
00:57:20,436 --> 00:57:21,771
then wait.

673
00:57:24,983 --> 00:57:26,734
A pervert like you

674
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,404
deserves a penalty like this.

675
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,948
Be good and wait.

676
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,533
Call me back in five minutes.

677
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,285
PAIK SA-EON

678
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:41,166
Is he out of his mind?

679
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,084
PAIK SA-EON

680
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,045
The person you're…

681
00:57:46,129 --> 00:57:48,089
PAIK SA-EON

682
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,634
The person you're trying to call…

683
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:56,222
The person you're trying…

684
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:56,241
PAIK SA-EON

685
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,832
Stay calm.

686
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:07,252
Do not get worked up.

687
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,891
-Stay calm…
-Good job.

688
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,979
From now on, wait on all fours like that.

689
00:59:27,021 --> 00:59:28,856
Do not get worked up.

690
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,650
Who knows?

691
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,819
I might even throw you a bone.

692
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:34,404
What did you say, bastard?

693
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,281
What are you trying to do?

694
00:59:36,364 --> 00:59:39,534
I really won't stand for this.
Don't regret this later.

695
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:11,065
PAIK SA-EON

696
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:18,448
The phone you called is turned off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

697
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:20,825
Additional fees may apply after the beep.

698
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,987
PAIK SA-EON

699
01:00:58,946 --> 01:01:02,992
The phone you called is turned off.
You'll be directed to voicemail.

700
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,410
Additional fees…

701
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:44,909
…is expected to move northward

702
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:47,870
and emphasized that we must stay vigilant.

703
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:49,706
Breaking news.

704
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,582
At 10:07 p.m. last night,

705
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,876
there was an explosion
in an office in Yeouido

706
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:55,837
resulting in injuries.

707
01:01:56,295 --> 01:01:59,465
The fire department
is investigating the cause of the fire.

708
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,217
Let's go to the scene now.

709
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:06,180
A man dressed in black with a cap on
climbs the stairs with a delivery bag.

710
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,975
He takes what looks like a pizza box
out of the bag

711
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,560
and enters the fifth-floor hallway.

712
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:14,480
Moments later, bright red flames spread
and black smoke rises.

713
01:02:14,564 --> 01:02:17,150
This is the office
where six people were injured.

714
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:21,946
Smoke lingers, with the victims'
computer fragments scattered around.

715
01:02:22,029 --> 01:02:24,907
According to reports,
the perpetrator held a grudge

716
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:27,243
and repeatedly made
threatening phone calls,

717
01:02:27,326 --> 01:02:28,870
hinting at the planned crime.

718
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:32,498
HBC has an exclusive recording
of the perpetrator's phone call.

719
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,625
Decide by tomorrow.

720
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:43,593
Or we can settle for two billion won.
You have until tomorrow.

721
01:02:43,676 --> 01:02:45,887
I was going to kill her. Do you get it?

722
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,139
Come on, man.

723
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,932
You still don't get it, do you?

724
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:52,769
The perpetrator,
who had been making threats,

725
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,354
set fire
to the victim's office last night.

726
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:57,190
-The fire department…
-A fire?

727
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:01,068
When did I do that?

728
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:05,198
There could've been casualties,
but quick action averted disaster.

729
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:08,284
The police, fire department, and forensics

730
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,036
are conducting an investigation.

731
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,456
They'll form a dedicated team
to look into the incident.

732
01:03:13,539 --> 01:03:15,500
This was Jang Seok-hyeon with HBC.

733
01:03:52,328 --> 01:03:53,162
Lately,

734
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,749
nothing makes sense.

735
01:04:00,628 --> 01:04:03,089
There can't be a Hong Hee-joo
I don't know about.

736
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:10,930
I need to find out

737
01:04:12,014 --> 01:04:13,432
which one is the real one.

738
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,310
Right now,

739
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,521
you're my only lead.

740
01:04:22,066 --> 01:04:23,609
So cooperate.

741
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,785
Do you want to take it off…

742
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:37,248
or should I?

743
01:04:54,515 --> 01:04:57,435
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

744
01:04:57,518 --> 01:05:03,232
3 YEARS AGO

745
01:05:09,030 --> 01:05:10,323
Have you decided?

746
01:05:12,116 --> 01:05:14,076
Cancel the wedding tomorrow.

747
01:05:14,619 --> 01:05:17,371
Make sure this arranged marriage
never happens.

748
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:27,089
Or I'll expose all of your family secrets.

749
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,478
Let me ask you something too.

750
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,397
Is Hong Hee-joo…

751
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,243
marrying the son
of the Yeonghwa Construction family?

752
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:58,120
Is that true?

753
01:06:15,388 --> 01:06:16,722
It's true.

754
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,019
That piece of trash is the last person

755
01:06:22,103 --> 01:06:24,105
that daughters of influential families
would marry.

756
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:28,776
And the only woman willing to sell
her daughter to him is Hee-joo's mom.

757
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,285
The wedding will be held
as planned tomorrow.

758
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:40,037
However,

759
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:42,999
let's switch the bride.

760
01:06:44,959 --> 01:06:46,293
What are you saying?

761
01:06:46,794 --> 01:06:47,670
You don't mean…

762
01:06:52,466 --> 01:06:55,302
It won't be you. It'll be your sister.

763
01:07:37,720 --> 01:07:40,639
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

764
01:07:41,432 --> 01:07:42,892
You don't know what I'm trying to do

765
01:07:43,976 --> 01:07:45,770
or what I'm trying to see, right?

766
01:07:46,479 --> 01:07:48,814
Interpreter Hong Hee-joo?

767
01:07:50,232 --> 01:07:51,484
Do you like her?

768
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,071
Do you suspect me and Sang-woo?

769
01:07:55,196 --> 01:07:56,530
You know him so well.

770
01:07:57,323 --> 01:07:59,700
What about me?
How much do you know about me?

771
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:02,161
Sis!

772
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,790
Call him. Keep calling him.

773
01:08:05,873 --> 01:08:07,124
Dad!

774
01:08:08,793 --> 01:08:10,795
Just think of it as a bad dream.

775
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:11,837
Forget it all.

776
01:08:16,383 --> 01:08:18,385
