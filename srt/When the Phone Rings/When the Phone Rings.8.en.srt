00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:46,963
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,923
EPISODE 8

3
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:49,776
Thank you…

4
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:52,487
for all your hard work, 406.

5
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,655
You…

6
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,242
knew everything?

7
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,161
Since when? No…

8
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,415
If you knew, why didn't you…

9
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,459
Why didn't I what?

10
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:09,671
Why didn't you hate me?

11
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,297
Tell me,

12
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:15,885
Hong Hee-joo.

13
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,140
Tell me how to hate you.

14
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:24,018
Tell me how to not love you.

15
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
Eat slowly.

16
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:21,659
It's good.

17
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:25,830
I've been wondering for a while,
but why are you such a good cook?

18
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,417
Cooking's about sincerity.

19
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,421
To tell the truth,
as long as the kimchi's good,

20
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,632
this dish is a success.

21
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,511
It's really good.

22
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:43,723
From now on,

23
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,267
let's eat together often.

24
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:47,685
At home.

25
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:50,355
So it'll feel more like a home

26
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,566
and not feel like a jail.

27
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,694
When did I call it a jail?
That's what you said.

28
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:59,781
- I did?
- You just feel guilty.

29
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,158
No, I don't.

30
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,744
Was the three years
we lived together normal?

31
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:07,330
There were nothing but cold vibes
in this house.

32
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,625
We didn't speak or make eye contact.

33
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,794
We didn't eat or sleep together…

34
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,595
Do you want that?

35
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:30,186
If you hated sleeping in separate rooms,

36
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:32,647
you should've told me.

37
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:35,650
No, that's not what I'm saying.

38
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,654
To me,

39
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,615
this home was warm.

40
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,581
<i>When I returned home</i>

41
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,835
<i>and saw the lights in the window,</i>

42
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,587
<i>it made me feel good</i>

43
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:58,715
<i>to know you were there.</i>

44
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,856
<i>When I looked at you,</i>

45
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,692
<i>the noisy world around me</i>

46
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,445
<i>became quiet…</i>

47
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,031
and peaceful.

48
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:26,617
You should've told me sooner.

49
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,369
Do you remember

50
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:30,913
what I said to you before?

51
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,458
I told you

52
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:36,336
not to have any feelings for me.

53
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,131
Don't try to have any feelings for me.

54
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:42,467
Let it all go.

55
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,386
You don't need to act like a puppet
in front of me.

56
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,847
How could I forget that?

57
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:50,475
You didn't have to be so harsh.

58
00:05:53,478 --> 00:05:54,729
I was scared.

59
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,732
If I didn't draw the line like that,

60
00:05:59,275 --> 00:06:01,611
I was scared
I'd end up giving you my heart,

61
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:05,698
and before I knew it,
I'd think living like this with you

62
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,284
might actually be okay.

63
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:12,580
That I'd give up everything
and just cave in.

64
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,793
<i>Let me be clear.</i>

65
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,252
You weren't part of my plan.

66
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:19,378
So from now on,

67
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,673
if you interfere or get in my way,

68
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:24,717
I won't let it slide.

69
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,637
What was the plan

70
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,306
you mentioned back then?

71
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,605
I'll tell you when the time comes.

72
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,486
Actually…

73
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,532
I have something to tell you too.

74
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:54,914
UNKNOWN CALLER

75
00:06:59,836 --> 00:07:00,670
Relax.

76
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,713
Don't worry anymore.

77
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,675
I will track him down soon.

78
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:09,387
Also, about this phone,

79
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,598
only you and I know about it.

80
00:07:12,682 --> 00:07:14,392
It's not going to the police.

81
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:16,310
That'll never happen.

82
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,980
Are you worried it'll be revealed
that I'm involved?

83
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,649
I'm prepared for it.

84
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,694
Let's reveal everything and--

85
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,029
I'm going to take care of things
one by one.

86
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,698
You just wait.

87
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,325
Don't think about doing anything.

88
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,994
And for the time being,

89
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:35,663
don't speak in front of anyone

90
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,206
but me.

91
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:39,876
Why not?

92
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:43,004
The accomplice is someone close to us.
I'm sure of it.

93
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,089
Until we know exactly who it is,

94
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:46,799
we must be careful.

95
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,344
Okay.

96
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,143
To tell you the truth,

97
00:07:58,394 --> 00:07:59,812
I'm sad to end these calls.

98
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,522
It was fun.

99
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:04,859
The fiery Hong Hee-joo that only shows up

100
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,361
when she's 406.

101
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,990
Wait, where was that lingerie again?

102
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:15,036
Why? No, wait.

103
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:30,885
Why?

104
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,095
It's just…

105
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,598
hard to believe.

106
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:40,561
That you accepted me just as I am

107
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,730
and forgave me.

108
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,417
<i>Could you do the same</i>

109
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,004
<i>when you know everything about me?</i>

110
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:30,236
MASTER
DID YOU GET THE PHONE BACK?

111
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:34,323
<i>No.</i>

112
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,617
WHY NOT?

113
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,359
What the hell?

114
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:14,238
Damn it.

115
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,505
Just a moment!

116
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,674
Goodness.

117
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,675
Good grief.

118
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,560
- Goodness.
- What floor?

119
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,228
Thank you. I'm going to B4.

120
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,229
I see.

121
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,068
Thank you.

122
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,278
Goodness.

123
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,573
Aren't you Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon?

124
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,866
Yes.

125
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,369
It's an honor to meet you.

126
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:03,704
I saw the news. Are you okay?

127
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:07,333
The world's so chaotic
that all sorts of crazy people dare

128
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,669
to do things like that to you.

129
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,088
Thank you for your concern.

130
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,547
Take care of yourself.

131
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:16,008
Such a bad guy should be caught…

132
00:11:29,146 --> 00:11:30,314
<i>Did you know?</i>

133
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:33,067
<i>Paik Sa-eon</i>

134
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,113
<i>smells really good.</i>

135
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,839
<i>What I want to get back</i>
<i>isn't that stupid phone.</i>

136
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,890
<i>I'm going to take it all.</i>

137
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:08,269
<i>Even the scent coming from him.</i>

138
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,657
<i>The screen beside me shows</i>
<i>the composite sketch of the suspect.</i>

139
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:23,701
<i>According to police,</i>

140
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:26,871
<i>the suspect is around 185 cm tall</i>
<i>with a solid build</i>

141
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,165
<i>and in his early to mid-thirties.</i>

142
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:34,003
<i>And he is odd-eyed, and one eye</i>
<i>appears light brown in different lighting.</i>

143
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,673
<i>He has also been reported</i>
<i>to have anger management issues,</i>

144
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:41,469
<i>acting impulsively</i>
<i>due to a lack of control.</i>

145
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:42,678
Sir. Ma'am.

146
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:47,475
HBC has reached out to confirm if
the interview will proceed as scheduled.

147
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:51,061
- Cancel it.
- Say we'll do it.

148
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,234
Yes, ma'am.

149
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:04,867
Mr. Min.

150
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,076
Yes, sir?

151
00:13:58,796 --> 00:14:00,839
<i>The number you dialed doesn't exist.</i>

152
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,218
<i>Please check the number and try again.</i>

153
00:14:07,096 --> 00:14:10,391
<i>The number you dialed doesn't exist.</i>

154
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,642
<i>Please check…</i>

155
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,772
<i>The number you dialed doesn't exist.</i>

156
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:17,690
<i>Please check…</i>

157
00:15:29,553 --> 00:15:31,013
Did you sleep well?

158
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,854
Aren't you going to work?

159
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:40,981
Not today.

160
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,195
I won't move an inch today.

161
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:48,322
I took the day off.

162
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:52,284
You did?

163
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,039
As you know,

164
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,708
for the past three years,

165
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,627
I've worked without any days off,

166
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,295
even on holidays and weekends.

167
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,548
I can take a day off.

168
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,301
Then…

169
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:11,804
what will you do today?

170
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,476
Is there something you want to do?

171
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,105
Well…

172
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,401
There is.

173
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,405
Things that I never imagined
we could do together.

174
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,411
<i>I know it's ridiculous,</i>

175
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:38,872
<i>but I imagined it sometimes.</i>

176
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,049
<i>Us being…</i>

177
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,428
<i>completely ordinary</i>
<i>just like everyone else.</i>

178
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:12,906
<i>Funny, right?</i>

179
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,619
<i>Even though I wanted to get a divorce</i>
<i>and to escape this house every day.</i>

180
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,421
Since when?

181
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:29,840
What?

182
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,050
When did you

183
00:17:31,717 --> 00:17:33,052
start imagining that?

184
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,428
I don't know.

185
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,391
Probably…

186
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,026
<i>She is…</i>

187
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,029
my wife.

188
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,365
<i>Did you fall for me then?</i>

189
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,367
Fall for you? Me?

190
00:17:58,285 --> 00:18:02,206
It's just that I'd never thought
you'd do something like that.

191
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,333
For me,

192
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:07,544
it was way before that.

193
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,090
Way before.

194
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,550
When?

195
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,054
Well…

196
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,039
CHIEF KANG YOUNG-WOO

197
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:51,421
- Yes?
<i>- Mr. Paik?</i>

198
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,925
<i>- Sorry for disturbing you on your day off.</i>
- What is it?

199
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:58,428
<i>I'm really sorry, but I think</i>
<i>you need to come here right away.</i>

200
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:05,435
A car's coming!

201
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,353
He's here!

202
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,232
- Wait.
- Move out of the way.

203
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:11,692
Wait a moment.

204
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:13,360
Move. Just a moment.

205
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:14,736
- Please move.
- Move.

206
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,446
Move out of the way.

207
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,532
Why was Paik Sa-eon being threatened?

208
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,201
Who do you think is
the mastermind behind them?

209
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:25,038
Paik Sa-eon's statement
was completely different from your claims.

210
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:26,540
Could you comment on that?

211
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,751
Why do you think that is?

212
00:19:31,044 --> 00:19:32,671
The spokesperson

213
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:37,092
drew a clear line to avoid causing
any trouble to his father's future.

214
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:41,180
He didn't want
to make a fuss over a political issue.

215
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:44,433
Then, do you still think
those trying to harm you

216
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:47,561
are the ones who attacked
the spokesperson?

217
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,607
Wait. What's that?

218
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,650
Move out of the way.

219
00:19:53,734 --> 00:19:55,402
- What are you doing?
- Move.

220
00:19:55,485 --> 00:19:56,778
Stop. Don't go inside.

221
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,530
- Hey.
- You can't go inside.

222
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:09,458
PAIK JANG-HO'S GRANDSON,
PAIK UI-YONG'S SON

223
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,545
I KNOW WHAT PAIK SA-EON DID

224
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,299
Share a few words!

225
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,486
YOU GOT THIS!
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER!

226
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:41,531
THIS TOO SHALL PASS!

227
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:50,082
After thinking about how to offer
our support and comfort,

228
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:51,667
we prepared this.

229
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:53,585
Do you like it?

230
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,426
Mr. Kang.

231
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:02,928
Yes?

232
00:21:03,595 --> 00:21:04,554
Did you ask me

233
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:07,307
to hurry to the office for this?

234
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,937
When I took my first day off
in three years?

235
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,146
Yes.

236
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,940
You took your first day off
in three years.

237
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:16,775
We imagined how you felt,

238
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:19,945
how difficult it must've been.

239
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:28,912
Since we prepared this anyway,
should we take a commemorative photo?

240
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,336
By the way, where's Mr. Park?

241
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:39,798
Sir!

242
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,847
You've found his location?

243
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,057
Yes, the reverse tracking is complete.

244
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,021
Hajeong, Gyeonggi-do?

245
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:55,897
Does the location ring a bell?

246
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:00,861
Are you going right now?

247
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:03,113
- Then I'll come with--
- I'll go alone.

248
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,865
Don't tell the police.

249
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,284
Sir.

250
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:11,079
Be careful.

251
00:22:12,164 --> 00:22:13,165
Great work.

252
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:19,504
CHILDREN'S WELFARE CENTER

253
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:20,422
Enjoy!

254
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:22,049
- Okay!
- Okay!

255
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:28,930
We're still eating what you bought before.

256
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,348
I appreciate it.

257
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,850
That reminds me.

258
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:36,354
Did you find out anything more
about what you asked me last time?

259
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:37,856
That? No.

260
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,818
I've been asking his peers
to try to find the twin brother,

261
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:44,362
but no one knows anything.

262
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,785
By the way, what about the newscaster
who came with you before?

263
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,828
She didn't come today.

264
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,330
Oh, her.

265
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:55,624
She's probably working.

266
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,375
She's not your girlfriend?

267
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,212
Not at all. She's just a colleague.

268
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,172
Then again…

269
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:05,425
I remember your first love.

270
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,095
She was nothing like her, right?

271
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,389
My first love?

272
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,850
Her name was…

273
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,645
Hong Hee-joo, right?

274
00:23:20,524 --> 00:23:21,525
Yeah, well…

275
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:26,404
You've got a great memory.

276
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,739
Of course.

277
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,660
She came to our center regularly
to volunteer for years.

278
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:34,121
She even taught the kids to sign.

279
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,499
I haven't seen her in so long.

280
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,793
I wonder how she's doing.

281
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,799
The chairman said
to bring you home for now,

282
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,384
but no, you need to hold out.

283
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,720
The moment you leave this house,
you can't come back.

284
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,805
Also,

285
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,226
I know who the culprit is.

286
00:23:56,768 --> 00:24:00,730
Who else would threaten Sa-eon
and talk about your marriage?

287
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,025
Hong In-a. Who else?

288
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,070
That brat…

289
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:10,282
I could tell she was trying
to break you two apart.

290
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:11,992
She must regret her choice now.

291
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:14,286
What great timing, right?

292
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,748
The election's soon, things are
going well, and she's trying to ruin it.

293
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:23,920
Hey.

294
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,756
Did you know she was back?

295
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,927
What did she say? Does she want
everything back? You told her no, right?

296
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,639
Don't see her again.

297
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,850
Don't listen to anything she says, got it?

298
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:45,358
<i>Sis, remember what I said before?</i>

299
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:49,487
<i>You don't know anything about Paik Sa-eon.</i>

300
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:53,116
You can't even eat what's handfed to you.

301
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,368
<i>- Don't you want to know?</i>
- How could you only

302
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,287
- take after your father?
<i>- Are you curious?</i>

303
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:00,665
Get it together,
or you'll end up like your father.

304
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,338
Hey, I'm leaving.

305
00:25:11,593 --> 00:25:12,510
What is this?

306
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,936
HBC JANG HYEOK-JIN

307
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:25,523
- Hello?
<i>- This was just posted.</i>

308
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,609
<i>Take a look at what I sent.</i>

309
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:36,910
I KNOW WHAT PAIK SA-EON DID

310
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,496
<i>Do you think the culprit sent this?</i>

311
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:41,081
What's wrong with him?

312
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,166
What grudge does he have against you?

313
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,293
<i>- I'm on my way to find out.</i>
- What?

314
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,045
Where?

315
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,468
<i>Nothing!</i>

316
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,936
CALLS
PAIK SA-EON

317
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:15,573
<i>Hee-joo, how are you doing?</i>

318
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:30,005
HEE-JOO, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

319
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:35,427
ARE YOU OKAY?
I CAN'T REACH YOU, SO I'M WORRIED.

320
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:36,803
<i>It's been a while, Sang-woo.</i>

321
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,806
<i>Hee-joo, have you been well?</i>

322
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:46,104
<i>Sang-woo, can you meet me right now?</i>

323
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,230
Right now?

324
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,778
WILL PAIK SA-EON BLACKMAIL CASE AFFECT
PAIK UI-YONG'S ELECTION?

325
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,659
How are you going to handle this?

326
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,203
There's a limit to what I can stop.

327
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,040
The person to handle this
isn't me or the spokesperson,

328
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,875
it's you.

329
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,337
- Take responsibility and fix it.
- What?

330
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,298
What kind of absurd nonsense is this?

331
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:17,886
Didn't all of this happen
because of your daughters?

332
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,473
If it'd gone as originally agreed,
this wouldn't be happening!

333
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,851
Why give them the chance to find fault?

334
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,730
It's all in the past,

335
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:31,232
but since you brought it up,

336
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:33,193
let me ask you something.

337
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:36,112
Your family's Achilles' heel,

338
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:40,241
are you sure it was taken care of
by Chairman Paik?

339
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,040
No?

340
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,667
Is there something left

341
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,836
that hasn't been cleared away?

342
00:27:54,547 --> 00:27:55,548
Of course not.

343
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,384
If, and I mean if,

344
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:03,306
that thing shows up now
and holds you or me back,

345
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,226
this time,

346
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,270
I'll chop it

347
00:28:10,563 --> 00:28:11,689
into tiny pieces

348
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:15,068
from head to tail myself

349
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:19,155
and neatly scatter them in your yard.

350
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,618
So, either look forward to it
or prepare for it.

351
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,414
I advise you to do something,
Candidate Paik.

352
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,379
I advise you to repay me first.

353
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,135
Shouldn't you at least pretend

354
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,930
to repay the debt you owe me
from three years ago?

355
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,354
I'm talking about your eldest daughter.

356
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,610
I'm glad nothing happened.

357
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:01,740
So many incidents happened
after you started working there.

358
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:04,492
I felt a little troubled.

359
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,328
<i>Thanks for your concern.</i>

360
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,831
But what's going on?

361
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,666
What brings you here?

362
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:20,049
<i>The case you're investigating</i>
<i>on the program you're appearing on,</i>

363
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,012
<i>didn't you say it was about a case</i>
<i>of missing orphans?</i>

364
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,891
Yeah, that's right.

365
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,770
<i>Can you tell me more about it?</i>

366
00:30:58,106 --> 00:30:59,566
<i>Help yourself!</i>

367
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,776
<i>Eat it before it cools.</i>

368
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:06,781
<i>You don't like it? Those were good too.</i>

369
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,450
<i>The meat was bursting out.</i>

370
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:11,494
<i>It wasn't just like a sausage or ham.</i>

371
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,246
<i>Yeah. That's right.</i>

372
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,414
<i>What's it like?</i>

373
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,915
<i>What Korean food does it resemble?</i>

374
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:16,833
<i>Nothing!</i>

375
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:20,795
<i>If this is how it's going to be,</i>

376
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,297
<i>don't call it a seminar.</i>

377
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:30,388
YOU DID IT

378
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:32,390
YOU'RE THE KILLER

379
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:36,269
PAIK SA-EON

380
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,070
<i>The meat was bursting out.</i>

381
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,072
<i>It wasn't just like a sausage or ham.</i>

382
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:49,657
<i>Yeah. That's right.</i>

383
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,783
<i>What's it like?</i>

384
00:31:50,867 --> 00:31:52,660
<i>What Korean food does it resemble?</i>

385
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,578
<i>Nothing!</i>

386
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,456
MISSING ORPHAN CASE
CONTACT US IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING

387
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:11,846
This house is where the orphanage kids
went in and never came out.

388
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,474
Why is the door open?

389
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:17,727
<i>Does someone live here now?</i>

390
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:18,645
No.

391
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:20,104
I don't think so.

392
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,607
<i>Did you go in?</i>

393
00:32:22,690 --> 00:32:24,567
Yeah. Last time I came here.

394
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,364
Hee-joo, why do you ask about the case?

395
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:32,241
Do you know something about it?

396
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,208
You're asking about it.

397
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,877
And the spokesperson asked before.

398
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,380
You're both very interested.

399
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,092
<i>We're coming back from covering a site.</i>

400
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:53,262
You know that we're doing a show together.

401
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,848
You-ri told me you asked her about me.

402
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:00,395
What's the story about?

403
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,151
It's too late tonight.

404
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,404
So let's come back during the day.

405
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,602
PAIK SA-EON

406
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,231
Is there someone that calls you?

407
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,112
Take it.

408
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,658
You can take it.

409
00:33:58,578 --> 00:33:59,996
<i>How could I?</i>

410
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,667
I guess there's someone
who knows besides me.

411
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,670
<i>Know what?</i>

412
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:12,675
That you can speak.

413
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:22,602
What's that?

414
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,943
HONG HEE-JOO

415
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:37,867
What are they doing?

416
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:02,517
Is he crazy?

417
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,067
Don't get out.

418
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,488
- Open it.
- Don't.

419
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,241
We don't know why he's acting like this.

420
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:20,868
Hee-joo.

421
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:23,746
Hee-joo!

422
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:26,082
What are you doing?

423
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,250
Let go.

424
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,845
I'm warning you,

425
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:41,472
don't ever come near Hong Hee-joo again.

426
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:42,640
Who are you to say that?

427
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,977
What exactly is your relationship
with Hee-joo?

428
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,186
You answer me first.

429
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,523
How much do you know
about the Sinil Childcare Center incident?

430
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:53,192
Have you found the culprit?

431
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,194
Why do you ask--

432
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,988
There'd be an investigation if they had!

433
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,701
Do you already know who the culprit is?

434
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:04,453
So, you're seeking revenge?

435
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:05,413
"Revenge"?

436
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,917
I don't know if I'm having
reasonable doubts about you

437
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,878
or if it's just a misunderstanding,

438
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,046
but stop here.

439
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:15,965
Stop…

440
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,884
digging into this case.

441
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,803
Why do you care so much about it?

442
00:36:22,597 --> 00:36:24,182
What does it have to do with you?

443
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:31,189
What bothers me isn't the case, it's you.

444
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,649
From the moment you appeared,

445
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,319
the threats, kidnapping,
and explosions started.

446
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,115
Is that really a coincidence?

447
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:42,617
What?

448
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,481
Why did you come here?

449
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:19,487
Because of this.

450
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:21,656
It was sent to me.

451
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:22,782
<i>…a sausage or ham.</i>

452
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,617
<i>Yeah. That's right.</i>

453
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,744
<i>- What Korean food does it resemble?</i>
<i>- Nothing!</i>

454
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,554
UNKNOWN CALLER
YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT PAIK SA-EON.

455
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,483
So did you go

456
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:00,111
to ask Ji Sang-woo?

457
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,989
I asked about the case.

458
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,532
Why didn't you ask me?

459
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:08,327
Were you scared to ask?

460
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,623
Answer me, Hong Hee-joo.

461
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:16,877
You're right.

462
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:18,546
I was scared.

463
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,357
Why?

464
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,444
Are you scared and anxious

465
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:43,904
that you might find…

466
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:47,908
something shocking about me?

467
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,202
Is that it?

468
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,293
I've been scared,

469
00:38:58,836 --> 00:38:59,837
anxious,

470
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:03,591
and wanted to run away many times.

471
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,848
I was afraid you'd find out
that I was 406,

472
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:14,894
that you wouldn't forgive me,

473
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:19,607
or that you'd never want to see me again.

474
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,030
I wanted to run away

475
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,077
before you found out about everything.

476
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:33,621
So I am scared and anxious.

477
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:36,957
That you might run away

478
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:39,543
if I find out your secret,

479
00:39:42,088 --> 00:39:43,130
just like I wanted to.

480
00:39:45,174 --> 00:39:47,009
So I couldn't ask you.

481
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:50,179
Because…

482
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,183
I know what that's like.

483
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,857
That's not the only thing I'm scared of.
Today, I…

484
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,780
I've felt anxious ever since I woke up.

485
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,658
<i>I was scared last night</i>

486
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,495
<i>was just a dream.</i>

487
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,123
<i>The kind of dream</i>

488
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:20,418
<i>that makes me break down in tears</i>
<i>when I wake up,</i>

489
00:40:21,168 --> 00:40:23,421
<i>feeling empty and sad.</i>

490
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,471
This kind of happiness

491
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,099
would never happen to me.

492
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:38,060
No one would love me this easily.

493
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,814
That's never happened to me before,
so how could I?

494
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,242
How can I make you believe it?

495
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,744
What can I do

496
00:40:57,746 --> 00:40:58,622
to ease your mind?

497
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,548
Don't hide anything from me.

498
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:09,383
Show me everything.

499
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:12,011
I can handle anything.

500
00:41:14,346 --> 00:41:15,806
Don't be so sure of that.

501
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,974
Why not?

502
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:23,063
You knew I was 406,
yet you didn't abandon me.

503
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,440
Let us

504
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:27,318
show each other our worst

505
00:41:28,027 --> 00:41:29,320
and make it even.

506
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,786
Hong Hee-joo.

507
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,248
If…

508
00:41:43,375 --> 00:41:45,211
something happens to me

509
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,882
and the Paik Sa-eon you've known

510
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:52,426
disappears from this world,

511
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:57,723
even if I throw away the title
of Paik Jang-ho's grandson,

512
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,602
Paik Ui-yong's son, and the spokesperson,

513
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,022
just remember this.

514
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,237
The only Paik Sa-eon I want to leave
behind in this world is the one…

515
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:19,161
that belongs to Hong Hee-joo.

516
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,150
In-a, why did you come back
without me knowing?

517
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:57,032
When I said I couldn't marry him,

518
00:42:57,616 --> 00:42:59,243
I thought you'd force me to.

519
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,037
But you let me go easily,

520
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,248
so I was grateful

521
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,083
yet a bit surprised.

522
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,502
Was it all part of your plan?

523
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:12,673
Were you the one who sent me those papers?

524
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,472
PAIK UI-YONG AND PAIK SA-EON
DNA NOT MATCHED

525
00:43:26,478 --> 00:43:29,231
<i>When I think about it,</i>
<i>you didn't look so surprised.</i>

526
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:31,150
As if you already knew.

527
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,110
No.

528
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,948
There was no reason for you
to send it anonymously.

529
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:40,242
You could've just told me.

530
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,577
Stop talking nonsense.

531
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:43,537
What was the reason?

532
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,831
Why did you make me
run away from that marriage?

533
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:50,044
What's the contract you signed
with Chairman Paik?

534
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,879
<i>What did you just say?</i>

535
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:54,632
Your second daughter?

536
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:55,549
Sir.

537
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,887
Hundreds of wedding invitations
went out under In-a's name.

538
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:04,224
Everyone knows that Paik Ui-yong's son
is engaged to Chungwoon family's eldest.

539
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,561
Now you want to send your second daughter
down the aisle?

540
00:44:10,356 --> 00:44:11,565
This is a soap opera.

541
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:15,402
Have you lost your mind
since your daughter ran off?

542
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:17,821
Also, why should we take
your second daughter?

543
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,866
Do you think she's on the same level
as Sa-eon?

544
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,534
There's nothing more to discuss.

545
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:25,079
- Let's prepare a statement.
- No one will know.

546
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,248
Let's just fill the empty slot.

547
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:31,418
You've done it before, so you know.

548
00:44:32,044 --> 00:44:33,587
It's easier than you think.

549
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:43,931
Our two families…

550
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,686
have a long-standing agreement.

551
00:44:55,401 --> 00:44:59,530
Chairman Paik kneeled before me
and made this promise.

552
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,033
He promised to grant me

553
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:05,285
anything I wanted,

554
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:09,039
whenever and whatever it may be.

555
00:45:10,666 --> 00:45:13,710
IF THE CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE IS UPHELD,
PARTY B MUST ACCOMMODATE ANY REQUEST

556
00:45:13,794 --> 00:45:15,421
MADE BY PARTY A, WHENEVER, WHEREVER.

557
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,470
PAIK JANG-HO
HONG IL-GYEONG

558
00:45:26,181 --> 00:45:27,474
<i>I heard it from her.</i>

559
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,893
Who is all ears and loose-tongued.

560
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:34,356
But I'm sure you wouldn't just tell me,

561
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,234
so I thought about it.

562
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:41,196
The car accident when I was young.

563
00:45:42,030 --> 00:45:43,073
After that,

564
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:45,409
you were mad for a while.

565
00:45:46,326 --> 00:45:50,664
You had the police and prosecutors
investigate and dig everything up.

566
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:53,834
As if you'd make a culprit
if there wasn't one.

567
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:55,294
But…

568
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,547
why did you stop?

569
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,425
No.

570
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,178
Who made you stop?

571
00:46:19,318 --> 00:46:21,403
Don't bring up the rotten past.

572
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,948
Do you want to know
what you should be focusing on now?

573
00:46:27,534 --> 00:46:30,037
Did you hear
that Paik Sa-eon is being threatened?

574
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,497
The culprit

575
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:34,333
knows everything about Hee-joo.

576
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:36,460
Hee-joo?

577
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,544
That means…

578
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,339
they know

579
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,799
what happened to you,

580
00:46:43,550 --> 00:46:44,968
Sa-eon, and Hee-joo.

581
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:49,473
How are you so sweet?

582
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:55,354
What's your secret to maintaining
such a happy marriage?

583
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:57,940
Well, there's nothing special.

584
00:46:58,023 --> 00:47:00,400
We just fill each other with what we lack

585
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,529
and share what we have in excess.

586
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,698
While doing that, we've become like one.

587
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,283
I can't live without her now.

588
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,995
In such a harmonious home,

589
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,166
I hear there have been some troubling
and worrying issues lately.

590
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:20,170
It's about your son,
Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon.

591
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,213
Yes, about that…

592
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:23,465
"The threats and acts of terror were

593
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,051
crimes of vengeance."

594
00:47:26,718 --> 00:47:28,971
"The victim provided the reason
for the threats."

595
00:47:29,555 --> 00:47:31,723
I hear there are various rumors.

596
00:47:32,516 --> 00:47:33,350
Yes.

597
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,186
However, some insist
that that isn't the case

598
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:39,565
and urge caution
against reckless speculation.

599
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:43,652
I apologize for causing concern
to our supporters and the public

600
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,697
who have trusted and watched over us.

601
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:50,576
We promise to resolve this matter swiftly.

602
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,369
However,

603
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,913
to my son Sa-eon,

604
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:59,585
who must be suffering more than anyone,

605
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:01,628
as his mother,

606
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:04,423
I want to say something.

607
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,301
Goodness. That would be great.

608
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,762
Now, look at the camera
and say what you have to say, please.

609
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:11,930
Okay.

610
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,614
Sa-eon.

611
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:31,116
Do you remember?

612
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:33,493
Remember…

613
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,831
what I always said to you?

614
00:49:10,155 --> 00:49:10,989
I'm…

615
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:14,284
not locking you up.

616
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:18,580
I'm protecting you.

617
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:24,878
I will…

618
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,965
still protect you.

619
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,969
I'll protect you,

620
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:35,931
Sa-eon.

621
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:39,810
<i>I'm sorry for the worry I've caused.</i>

622
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:42,020
<i>I'll work really hard.</i>

623
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,439
Don't be sorry.

624
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:45,357
You did great.

625
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,568
But I think you lost weight.

626
00:49:49,611 --> 00:49:51,488
How are you feeling?

627
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:52,906
<i>I'm okay.</i>

628
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:55,742
Now.

629
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:57,411
To welcome you back to work,

630
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,871
we've prepared a gift for you.

631
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:01,873
<i>A gift?</i>

632
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:04,209
You'll be the interpreter
for the spokesperson's speech

633
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:06,878
at this year's
Environmental Climate Day event.

634
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:11,842
See. I told you she'd be happy.

635
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:12,759
You're right.

636
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,471
I was worried it might be too much
since you just got back,

637
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,014
but your face says otherwise.

638
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,726
Let us know if it's too much for you.

639
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,978
<i>It's not at all!</i>

640
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:26,022
<i>Just leave it to me,</i>
<i>and I'll do my best to prepare!</i>

641
00:50:28,108 --> 00:50:31,027
Through this visit to France,
our government aims

642
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:34,239
to strengthen the trust and friendship
between the two nations

643
00:50:34,322 --> 00:50:36,700
and establish a stepping stone

644
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:38,618
into a cooperative partnership.

645
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:42,205
Furthermore, we expect this visit
to contribute to the expansion

646
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:44,750
and diversification
of our diplomatic outreach.

647
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:46,251
That is all.

648
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:55,343
All right.
We will take questions from now on.

649
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:56,970
- Spokesperson.
- Over here.

650
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,430
I have a question.

651
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:00,807
- Over here.
- There's so much enthusiasm.

652
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:05,061
However, we'll only take questions
related to today's issues.

653
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,279
How about a back briefing?

654
00:51:14,362 --> 00:51:17,324
- A back briefing?
- I'll take questions on any topic.

655
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:20,327
- Sir?
- I have a question!

656
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,996
- Over here!
- Spokesperson, I have a question.

657
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,581
- Sir!
- Here!

658
00:51:24,664 --> 00:51:25,499
Please.

659
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,002
What did the blackmailer demand?

660
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,797
And why didn't you report it
after the first threat?

661
00:51:32,464 --> 00:51:33,298
Well…

662
00:51:33,924 --> 00:51:34,925
Another question.

663
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:39,554
"I know what you did, Paik Sa-eon."

664
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:41,890
What do you think this means?

665
00:51:41,973 --> 00:51:42,974
Yes, any more?

666
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:46,978
Go ahead.

667
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:50,524
You firmly said
it was not political terrorism.

668
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,025
How are you so sure?

669
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:58,573
Surprisingly, it seems
you're all being careful around me.

670
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:01,368
You can ask bolder questions.

671
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,119
Let's be honest,

672
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,914
you're all curious about one thing.

673
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:09,042
You've all dug into me
and never found any dirt.

674
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:13,004
So, what could be
Paik Sa-eon's deadly weakness?

675
00:52:13,964 --> 00:52:14,798
A woman?

676
00:52:14,881 --> 00:52:15,715
Gambling?

677
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:17,300
Drugs?

678
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:18,510
He's out of his mind.

679
00:52:18,593 --> 00:52:21,096
- Sir…
- I'm going to show you something,

680
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:22,973
and I want you all to make use

681
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:25,267
of your information
and investigative skills

682
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:26,768
to solve this quiz.

683
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:31,231
<i>The meat was bursting out.</i>
<i>It wasn't just like a sausage or ham.</i>

684
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,816
<i>Yeah. That's right.</i>

685
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:34,568
<i>What's it like?</i>

686
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:36,444
<i>- What Korean food does it resemble?</i>
<i>- Nothing!</i>

687
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:44,077
The video I just showed you is

688
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,997
what I received from the blackmailer
just yesterday.

689
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,041
But you can't tell what it's about,
can you?

690
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,751
What does he want?

691
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,421
What's he threatening me with?

692
00:52:55,088 --> 00:52:56,298
It's the same for me.

693
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:59,718
So I need your help.

694
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,886
So,

695
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:02,929
what if we figure it out?

696
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:09,227
The one who figures it out
will get an exclusive interview.

697
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:23,491
Stop it.

698
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,162
Why are you treating us
and even grilling the meat?

699
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,790
<i>It's all done. Please, eat.</i>

700
00:53:31,374 --> 00:53:33,001
- Let's eat!
- Thank you.

701
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,422
It's so good.

702
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:40,508
<i>Right? Eat your fill.</i>

703
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:44,137
Why aren't you eating?

704
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:45,388
No, I am.

705
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,974
What is it?

706
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:49,351
Are you crying?

707
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,353
I'm not crying.

708
00:53:52,812 --> 00:53:54,481
The smoke got in my eye.

709
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:57,025
There's no smoke here.

710
00:53:57,108 --> 00:53:58,109
I mean…

711
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,697
It feels like just yesterday
you were practicing sign language

712
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:06,034
with those tiny, delicate hands,
fumbling this way and that.

713
00:54:07,243 --> 00:54:09,037
When did you grow up like this?

714
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,791
Now you're the interpreter
for the presidential office

715
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,251
and are treating us to <i>galbi.</i>

716
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:19,047
I'm so touched.

717
00:54:19,923 --> 00:54:21,383
I need to pull it together.

718
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,137
What's this?

719
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,681
Why is it so good?

720
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,934
You said your department
are regulars here.

721
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:32,644
I can see why.

722
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,397
<i>I wanted to come here with you.</i>

723
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,649
Thanks.

724
00:54:37,732 --> 00:54:40,402
You're the only one who thinks of me.

725
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:43,446
By the way, Hee-joo,

726
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,783
you've gotten so much prettier.

727
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:48,410
I thought the same.

728
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:50,537
- Me too.
- Right?

729
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:55,291
You look more radiant.
There's definitely something different.

730
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,127
Wait.

731
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:01,840
Did you get work done?

732
00:55:01,923 --> 00:55:02,757
Laser? Fillers?

733
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:03,925
Come on.

734
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,093
<i>No.</i>

735
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,553
I'm just kidding.

736
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:09,305
Hey.

737
00:55:09,389 --> 00:55:12,976
You got hired by the presidential office,

738
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:16,229
and you get to work right next
to the respected spokesperson.

739
00:55:16,312 --> 00:55:17,897
Of course, you look good.

740
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:21,443
But…

741
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:27,365
the atmosphere at the presidential office
has been chaotic lately.

742
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,743
Is the spokesperson okay?

743
00:55:30,326 --> 00:55:31,161
Right.

744
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,706
Are the threats for real?

745
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:37,042
There was the accident
at the company retreat too.

746
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:40,628
How would Hee-joo know?

747
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:41,796
Look here.

748
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:43,798
Just eat some <i>galbi.</i>

749
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,719
What is this? It's so good!

750
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,637
This is perilla pesto.

751
00:55:49,721 --> 00:55:51,389
A quiz?

752
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:54,559
A quiz?

753
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:59,355
I mean, why has our spokesperson
become so high-maintenance lately?

754
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:02,567
Why does he keep causing trouble
without consulting us?

755
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:04,819
See?

756
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:07,155
There it is.
It must be an answer to the quiz!

757
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,033
Spokesperson's office.

758
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,367
Is this…

759
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:15,330
the presidential spokesperson's office?

760
00:56:15,830 --> 00:56:17,749
<i>Yes, it is. How can I help you?</i>

761
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,627
I have

762
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:26,341
something I need to tell
Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon.

00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:14,055
Getting off.

766
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,434
Hello.

767
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,229
Hello.

768
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:44,419

00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:46,588
<i>lunch?</i>

00:57:58,099 --> 00:58:00,477
<i>I did. What about you?</i>

775
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:03,438
<i>So did I.</i>

776
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,649
<i>Your sign language has improved.</i>

777
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:11,654
<i>I've been practicing hard.</i>

778
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:13,656
<i>Am I</i>

779
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:14,908
<i>good?</i>

780
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,952
<i>Yes, it's rewarding to have taught you.</i>

781
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,506
<i>I'll see you later.</i>

782
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:33,176
<i>Okay, see you at home.</i>

783
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:38,932
<i>I won't be late.</i>

784
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:29,732
Sir?

785
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,484
A call came in a moment ago.

786
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,402
This…

787
00:59:36,322 --> 00:59:37,156
Come in.

788
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,218
I have something to pass along.

789
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,430
HE'S ALIVE

790
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:03,016
Is this all?

791
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:05,018
He hung up after saying this.

792
01:00:05,101 --> 01:00:08,521
So I immediately looked up
the caller's number,

793
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,440
and a business came up.

794
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:13,943
A business?

Hey. Pictures from the retreat

798
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:50,980
Did they turn out well?

799
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:52,523
- Let's see.
- Wow.

01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,941
Everyone looks great.

801
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:56,778
Mr. Jeong, you came out great.

802
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:44,450
Wait for me.

803
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:51,768

Help!

01:03:19,045 --> 01:03:19,879
Please help!

Help…

809
01:03:41,526 --> 01:03:42,777

my newlywed house.

<i>If you're trying to reclaim what's yours…</i>

819
01:05:10,448 --> 01:05:12,033
Shouldn't you ask first

820
01:05:12,617 --> 01:05:14,785
why I left in the first place?

822
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:34,722

823
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,975
that Sa-eon's blackmailer knows everything

824
01:05:38,726 --> 01:05:40,770
about you and this marriage.

825
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:43,147
Then you should also know

826
01:05:43,856 --> 01:05:45,775
why I refused this marriage.

827
01:05:46,484 --> 01:05:47,818
The reason…

828
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:51,197
you had to marry him in my place.

829
01:06:15,805 --> 01:06:17,014

01:06:17,098 --> 01:06:18,474

01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:56,595
It doesn't matter?

something happens to me

837
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:10,151
and the Paik Sa-eon you've known

838
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:13,070
disappears from this world,

839
01:07:14,196 --> 01:07:18,367
even if I throw away the title
of Paik Jang-ho's grandson,

840
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:22,246
Paik Ui-yong's son, and the spokesperson,

841
01:07:23,247 --> 01:07:24,540
just remember this.

01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:39,180
<i>The only Paik Sa-eon I want to leave</i>
<i>behind in this world is the one…</i>

845
01:07:49,315 --> 01:07:50,399
Did they turn out well?

846
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,901
Yes.

847
01:09:31,292 --> 01:09:34,211
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

848
01:09:34,295 --> 01:09:35,629
<i>What is this?</i>

01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,007
<i>What in the world happened?</i>

<i>There's one thing I'm sure of.</i>

<i>but protecting you.</i>

<i>I've been curious about this.</i>

854
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:50,186
Who does Spokesperson Paik take after?

855
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:52,855
<i>I wonder what his real name is.</i>

856
01:09:52,938 --> 01:09:53,814
<i>Even if I'm not</i>

857
01:09:53,898 --> 01:09:57,026
the Paik Sa-eon you knew,
does it not matter?

858
01:09:57,610 --> 01:09:59,195
It didn't matter to you either.

859
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:02,448
<i>It's my turn now.</i>

<i>It's my turn to protect you.</i>
