1
00:00:41,082 --> 00:00:46,963
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:00,727
I can't do this. Just let me out.

3
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:03,646
-We're on the road right now.
-It'll be okay if you just let me out.

4
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,484
It'll be okay, so let me out.

5
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,791
I don't care.

6
00:01:24,209 --> 00:01:28,004
Anyway, now that he's been moved,
I don't need to pay anymore, right?

7
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:33,885
Hey, Sa-eon.

8
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:37,013
When did you get here?

9
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,390
Let's go in.

10
00:01:39,474 --> 00:01:42,101
Oh my. You really are polite.

11
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,398
I'm curious about something.

12
00:01:47,482 --> 00:01:48,316
What?

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,695
Why won't Hee-joo speak?

14
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:55,240
What do you mean? Don't you know?

15
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,993
She's in shock
from a car accident as a child.

16
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:01,162
That shock…

17
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,457
affects her to this day?

18
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,337
Selective mutism

19
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,382
is when someone stops speaking
due to psychological factors.

20
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:16,010
Isn't it strange that she's been like that
for over 20 years?

21
00:02:17,095 --> 00:02:19,097
Well, the guilt was just so overwhelming.

22
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,265
What guilt?

23
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:24,310
Was the car accident Hee-joo's fault?

24
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,856
She lost her brother,
and her sister went deaf.

25
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,942
How could she be okay after that?
She shouldn't be.

26
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:34,863
But…

27
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,157
why do you ask that?

28
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,451
It seems you keep forgetting.

29
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:42,996
Hee-joo's my wife.

30
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:46,416
Please be careful how you treat her.
Watch what you say and do.

31
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,885
What was that?

32
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,721
Is he looking out for Hee-joo?

33
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,602
Sa-eon.

34
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,270
It's been a while.

35
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,898
I almost forgot your face.
Let's meet up more often.

36
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,941
Yeah, you're much more handsome now.

37
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:15,111
-In-a must be treating you well.
-Yeah.

38
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:16,446
-Let's toast.
-Cheers.

39
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,780
-Cheers.
-Let's toast.

40
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:25,830
It's nice.

41
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,041
I can taste apples.

42
00:03:28,124 --> 00:03:29,626
They're well-prepared.

43
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:30,585
Such a sommelier.

44
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:32,712
That's right.

45
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:39,802
Spokesperson.

46
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:42,847
Sir.

47
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:46,100
When do you plan on joining your father?

48
00:03:47,977 --> 00:03:50,521
I guess you haven't received
a satisfactory offer yet.

49
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:53,816
Things should be clear-cut
between parents and children as well.

50
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,030
Excuse me.

51
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:06,829
What did you say?

52
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,790
Supplementary pages?

53
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,543
If you don't know, listen carefully, 406.

54
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:14,963
Hee-joo isn't supplementary pages.

55
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:16,881
She's a brand-new language.

56
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:22,345
She's repeated the same hand movements
thousands of times to become who she is.

57
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,430
People don't know that.

58
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,934
So don't talk about my wife like that.

59
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,900
Excuse me, where did you find that?

60
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,988
In the bathroom.

61
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,873
You say you know her so well,
then why did you do that?

62
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,295
Why did you tell her
not to think you were a couple?

63
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,007
Are you okay?

64
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,445
Why were you on the railing?

65
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,447
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

66
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:20,838
Were you on a call?

67
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:25,635
Hong Hee-joo…

68
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,055
can't make calls.

69
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,147
Why were you on the phone?

70
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,072
Make a sound.

71
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,827
Make a sound like you just did.
Hiccup or whatever.

72
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:53,871
Should I force you?

73
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:09,637
Hong Hee-joo.

74
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,182
How could you?

75
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,493
Go ahead.

76
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:45,131
Yes?

77
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:47,133
The call finally went over
the ten-minute mark.

78
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,217
We got the location.

79
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,510
Where is it?

80
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:50,845
Don't be surprised.

81
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,639
Sogong-dong.
The hotel you're at right now.

82
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,143
I think this person is much closer to you
than we thought.

83
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,229
Is there anyone suspicious around you?

84
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,072
What am I thinking?

85
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:13,201
Wait.

86
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,621
Are you saying he's here right now?

87
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:04,168
Why aren't you going in?

88
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:32,947
Kyu-jin.

89
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,615
There must not be

90
00:09:35,324 --> 00:09:38,744
even a single rusty spoon in my household.

91
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,124
Think carefully
which is more important to you.

92
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:47,378
Being a mother to your son

93
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:50,256
or maintaining your status
as my daughter-in-law?

94
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,084
Yes, Mr. Paik.

95
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,086
Secure the guest list.

96
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:32,465
Hurry up and work on removing
the voice modulation too.

97
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,425
EPISODE 5

98
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,308
Hong Hee-joo.

99
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:51,609
Do you still have that scar?

100
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:03,287
When you were a kid,

101
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,748
you almost got bitten by a big dog.

102
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,211
Even back then,
you didn't let out a single scream.

103
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:13,798
How could such a young girl

104
00:11:14,715 --> 00:11:16,592
hold back a scream?

105
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,351
You're incredible, Hee-joo.

106
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,479
I wonder how long
you'll be able to hold out.

107
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:30,564
I'm curious.

108
00:11:42,034 --> 00:11:43,619
"Our next story."

109
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:46,288
"Pope Benedict XVI resigned,

110
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,666
and Pope Francis was elected."

111
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,627
"This is the first papal resignation
in 600 years

112
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:53,629
-while the pope is still alive."
-Hee-joo!

113
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,970
What's this?

114
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,931
Your dream is to be a newscaster?
A newscaster?

115
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,560
How can you be a newscaster?
You can't even speak! How?

116
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,690
Didn't I make myself clear?

117
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,901
The moment you start chattering
in front of In-a,

118
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,405
you and I will be kicked out
of this house.

119
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,339
I'm sure it wasn't the dog that hit you.

120
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,467
You should fight back.

121
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,719
Be it your mom, sister, or whoever.

122
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,097
Prepare yourself to fight back.

123
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,730
Whether it's parents or family,
there's always a chance for revenge.

124
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,248
You scraped your knee.

125
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,515
PAIK SA-EON

126
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:19,275
It's red, like your swollen cheek.

127
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,663
Hee-joo isn't supplementary pages.

128
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,708
She's a brand-new language.

129
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:17,458
Hong Hee-joo.

130
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,084
Come out here.

131
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,051
All this time,

132
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,763
you've been deceiving me, haven't you?

133
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,185
Don't look at me like you don't know.
I know everything.

134
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:37,102
Why?

135
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,772
Why did you go that far?

136
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,982
You've deceived me for 20 years!

137
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,904
You even resorted to doing this, but why?

138
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,659
Yeah, let's just say
you were young back then.

139
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,826
But you…

140
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,664
You're not a kid anymore.
You're a grown-up.

141
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,417
At least once you started living with me,

142
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,128
there was no reason to hide it.

143
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,896
Everyone has secrets.

144
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,488
Don't you have any?
Something you're hiding from me.

145
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,525
Finalists for the sign language
interpreter interview

146
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,527
will be contacted individually.

147
00:17:08,610 --> 00:17:11,572
They'll start work at the office tomorrow.

148
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:14,074
The main media reactions
to the hiring are…

149
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,415
"Everyone now has acquired
the right to watch

150
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:23,500
the president's speech
without discrimination."

151
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,961
"Korean Sign Language is on par
with the Korean language,

152
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,796
ensuring information access for the Deaf…"

153
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,840
Excuse me, sir?

154
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,675
Yes, well…

155
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,219
I know I'm lacking. I do, but still…

156
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:38,223
I worked hard to prepare this.
If something is making you uncomfortable

157
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,351
or making you unhappy, please…

158
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,563
No.

159
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:48,442
I'm pleased with it.

160
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:51,445
Great work.

161
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,034
Let's take a quick break.

162
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:02,164
MEN'S RESTROOM

163
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,043
My liver enzyme levels didn't just go up
for no reason.

164
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:09,713
When you get anxious, your liver shrinks.

165
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:15,469
What? Because of smoking and drinking?
No, that's a misconception.

166
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,889
Accumulated fatigue and stress
are all causes too, you know?

167
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,476
Okay, honey.

168
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,312
Yeah, I'll make sure
to take my supplements.

169
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,563
One more thing.

170
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:30,943
I'm going to stand tall,
and I'm not going to…

171
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,028
Sir…

172
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:35,989
-Mr. Paik?
-Mr. Kang?

173
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,616
Yes, sir.

174
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,451
Let's have a word.

175
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,292
Mr. Kang, do you…

176
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:49,962
tell your wife everything?

177
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,798
About that.

178
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:55,467
I definitely wasn't talking about you.

179
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,594
-It was about my health.
-Are there…

180
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,429
no secrets?

181
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:00,514
Excuse me?

182
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:01,932
In your marriage,

183
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,769
do you hide anything

184
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,147
or deceive each other?

185
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:11,817
I don't know. Not really.

186
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:13,944
Why do you ask?

187
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:19,700
Is your wife secretly hiding…

188
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,413
emergency funds from you?

189
00:19:26,623 --> 00:19:27,457
No.

190
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,543
What a relief.

191
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,880
As long as it's not about money, right?

192
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:35,465
-Is that so?
-Of course.

193
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:38,552
Also,

194
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:43,849
sometimes it's necessary to pretend
not to know and let things slide.

195
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,602
That's how you get some breathing room.

196
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:50,397
It'll be suffocating if you nitpick
and criticize every little thing.

197
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,483
Of course,

198
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:56,612
that won't be easy,
given your personality.

199
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:58,113
What's wrong with it?

200
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:02,242
Like, you're the type
who strives for perfection.

201
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:08,790
But still, marriage takes effort,
don't you think?

202
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,126
You could try calming your temper.

203
00:20:12,002 --> 00:20:12,836
Effort?

204
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:51,166
What? Goodness!

205
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,960
She passed! She passed!

206
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,879
She passed!

207
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:56,838
Congratulations.

208
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,465
Congratulations!

209
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:00,384
She passed!

210
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,644
CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING
THE FINAL INTERVIEW.

211
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,145
You worked hard.

212
00:21:14,231 --> 00:21:15,440
Great job.

213
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:20,445
Go and tell your family the good news.

214
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:24,199
Should we get some drinks?
What should we get?

215
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,242
-Yeah.
-Let's go.

216
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:29,413
-Are you buying?
-Let's have cake.

217
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,330
Cake!

218
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,665
It's been so long.

219
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,802
DAD

220
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:57,649
PAIK SA-EON

221
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,243
I passed.

222
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,922
There was no special treatment, right?

223
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,841
Did I earn this on my own?

224
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,308
Why is this so hard?

225
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,616
What do I do?

226
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,993
I almost forgot.

227
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,579
We have a welcome dinner
for the interpreters tomorrow.

228
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:53,914
We anticipate your attendance.

229
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,918
Normally, holding a company retreat
would be the proper thing to do.

230
00:22:58,668 --> 00:23:01,171
However, many are exhausted
from the workload.

231
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,965
Especially since Mr. Paik
has such a tight schedule,

232
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,051
we'll have a dinner instead.

233
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,350
Sir?

234
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,478
What did you just say?

235
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,480
A company retreat?

236
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,442
No, no. Since you have a busy schedule,
we'll have a dinner…

237
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:25,654
Aren't they the first sign language
interpreters in the president's office?

238
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,239
The media is interested as well.

239
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,075
Shouldn't we take a commemorative photo
for the press release?

240
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,537
Let's go on a retreat.

241
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:36,123
How's the weekend for everyone?

242
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,083
I'm free.

243
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,878
Sounds good. Since we're going,
let's make it an overnight trip.

244
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,171
Please arrange the venue.

245
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,265
Wow, I completely misjudged Mr. Park.

246
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,350
"I'm free."

247
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:57,978
They call him Paik Sa-eon's mini-me
for a reason.

248
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,106
No wonder Mr. Paik brought him in
when he started here.

249
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,610
He doesn't even attend the dinners,
so why?

250
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:18,123
What's this? It came out of nowhere.

251
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:28,675
Should I delete it now?

252
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,552
That would be weirder.

253
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,305
My stupid finger.

254
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:41,521
What does this mean? Explain yourself.

255
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:47,986
"Explain yourself"?

256
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:49,154
Is that too intense?

257
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:02,918
What do I do? I can't look.

258
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,634
Congrats on passing.

259
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:37,661
It's good. Just how I like it. Great pick.

260
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,329
I'm glad you enjoy it.

261
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,249
Try it, Mr. Paik.

262
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:43,959
Okay.

263
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:48,672
It's good.

264
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,926
It is good.

265
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,973
Thank you. It's thanks to you.

266
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,272
No, it's not.

267
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,316
Refrain from making statements
that could be misunderstood.

268
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,319
Let me be clear.
There was no special treatment.

269
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,535
Is it too stiff?

270
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,162
It's fine for me. Mr. Paik!

271
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:23,623
You must have weak teeth.

272
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,175
I'll buy you a meal.

273
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,595
You'll buy me a meal?

274
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:46,271
What's a good gift
to give someone who just got a job?

275
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,816
-The latest cellphone.
-It's already the latest.

276
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,110
A tablet? Laptop?

277
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,069
They have both.

278
00:26:53,778 --> 00:26:54,612
What else?

279
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:56,197
Share some ideas.

280
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:57,615
Well, a wallet?

281
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:59,784
-A bag?
-Not something you want.

282
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:00,910
Something practical…

283
00:27:00,994 --> 00:27:03,288
-It doesn't have to be practical.
-…or not.

284
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:05,123
-It doesn't have to be practical.
-Yeah.

285
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:06,249
Something sentimental.

286
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,001
Something thoughtful.

287
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,838
A new suit is pretty much
the go-to gift for a new job.

288
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:13,256
Come on.

289
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:15,550
A suit?

290
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,014
Great pick.

291
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:22,390
Yeah, not bad.

292
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,059
A suit.

293
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,654
Come here by six.

294
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,471
You want to go in there?

295
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:03,431
Yes.

296
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,520
Wait for me!

297
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:11,606
Goodness.

298
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,026
No way.

299
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:17,320
We can't go over this.

300
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,160
What are you doing?

301
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,000
I think it was here.

302
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:34,796
What?

303
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,297
A large portrait.

304
00:28:37,132 --> 00:28:39,259
I remember a huge hand with a dragon ring.

305
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:45,265
The room you played in every day.

306
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,850
Where is it?

307
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,601
That room.

308
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,311
Follow me.

309
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,419
This is the room.

310
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,590
I'm sure I saw it that day.

311
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,008
What?

312
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,259
A cute…

313
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:23,470
cat.

314
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,768
That child told me.

315
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,686
"Want to play?"

316
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,190
What? With what?

317
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,364
"Let's cut open the cat's belly."

318
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,245
"Next, the tail."

319
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,833
"Next, the leg."

320
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,463
"Next, the head."

321
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,615
The way he spoke sounded so innocent.

322
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,325
He said it as if it was nothing.

323
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:30,870
It made it more terrifying.

324
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:37,710
Missing?

325
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:40,672
Yes, a few kids from the orphanage

326
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,841
went missing shortly after being adopted.

327
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,592
I learned that after becoming an adult.

328
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,929
It's still an unsolved case.

329
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:53,768
Do you remember what you said
at our first meeting?

330
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:57,021
Instead of asking what it is,

331
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,483
shouldn't you be asking
why I haven't revealed it yet?

332
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:03,444
What's the reason?

333
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,698
Why are you digging up something
that happened over 20 years ago?

334
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,534
I was the first to discover that villa.

335
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:15,456
I suggested to the kids that we go too.

336
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,834
Once my channel grew big enough,

337
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:21,546
I wanted to reveal it
when people started paying attention.

338
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:25,508
Then I got the chance to be on the show
and thought, "This is it."

339
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,138
You've been holding onto this
for a long time.

340
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,557
I'm sorry.

341
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,060
You are?

342
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:38,646
For what?

343
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:40,398
To be honest,

344
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:47,196
Sa-eon asked me about you a few days ago.

345
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:51,075
I told him you grew up in an orphanage
by mistake.

346
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,912
Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon asked about me?

347
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,456
Like what?

348
00:31:56,539 --> 00:31:59,125
You know, this and that.

349
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,425
Goodness!

350
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,343
What is it?

351
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,011
This is great for Hee-joo!

352
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:11,262
What about Hee-joo?

353
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:13,932
She's going to the presidential office.

354
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:29,530
Are you Ms. Hong Hee-joo?

355
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,450
Right this way.

356
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:34,577
Considering the professional setting,

357
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:38,665
I went with a neutral and simple style
without any bold patterns or decorations.

358
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,916
What do you think?

359
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,836
The spokesperson's office called.

360
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:47,298
He said that you're the sign language
interpreter for the presidential office.

361
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,093
I was asked to prepare an outfit
suitable for you.

362
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:53,304
Would you like to try it on?

363
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,646
Welcome.

364
00:33:27,714 --> 00:33:29,966
It looks great with your complexion.

365
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:37,348
But it looks a little big.
I'll get you one in a smaller size.

366
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:48,609
You look so pretty.

367
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,032
You have such great proportions.
That suit really flatters you.

368
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:56,868
It looks good on you.

369
00:33:58,202 --> 00:33:59,078
We'll take it.

370
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:01,039
Okay, I'll wrap it up.

371
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,041
You can go ahead and change
if you're ready.

372
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:11,466
Try this one on too.

373
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,189
Thank you. Goodbye.

374
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:27,440
Take care.

375
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:43,206
Why didn't you try it on?

376
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,462
I don't have to try it on to know.

377
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:51,881
Know what?

378
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:57,595
I appreciate the suit. I'll wear it well.

379
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,846
Let's go and eat now.

380
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,229
What do you know?

381
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:12,068
I know something that flashy
doesn't really suit me.

382
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,454
I have nowhere to wear it to,
and it doesn't feel like it's for me.

383
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:24,580
So why bother?

384
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,916
Then, what about that?

385
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:47,812
PARK DO-JAE

386
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,022
Yes, go ahead.

387
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,525
The modulated voice analysis
isn't complete yet,

388
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:54,610
but I just received a strange report.

389
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,280
-What strange report?
-Don't be surprised.

390
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:00,867
Based on the waveform
and spectrogram analysis, 406 is…

391
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,544
A woman?

392
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,296
Are you sure?

393
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:16,215
Of course, there's a possibility
of an accomplice,

394
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,176
-or it could be a decoy.
-A decoy?

395
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:21,304
Using someone else's voice
without being the perpetrator.

396
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,556
You mean like a recording
or reading a script?

397
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,892
It's definitely not that.

398
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,979
The conversations weren't just
regurgitated on command like a parrot

399
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:32,857
but were more like real-time exchanges.

400
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,775
Rule out the possibility of recordings.

401
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:36,360
Proceed with the analysis…

402
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:28,621
Hong Hee-joo.

403
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,166
Underestimating yourself

404
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:33,793
is a bad habit.

405
00:37:35,169 --> 00:37:38,381
I'd like to help you break that bad habit.

406
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,800
What do you think?

407
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,697
It's expensive.

408
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,158
It says it's Hanwoo.

409
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:11,831
I want jjajangmyeon.

410
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:13,749
That's enough.

411
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,014
With sweet and sour pork.

412
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,727
SANG-WOO

413
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:41,319
Hee-joo, I heard the news.
Congrats on the interpreter job.

414
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,451
Do you want some wine?

415
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,411
You-ri wants to congratulate you too.

416
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:57,001
-Sang-woo, I'm sorry, but next time…
-Go now.

417
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:01,088
But with me.

418
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,221
-Congratulations, Hee-joo.
-Congrats.

419
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:31,452
But how did you two come together?

420
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,248
She said she'd buy me dinner.

421
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:38,334
Interpreter Hong Hee-joo.

422
00:39:38,417 --> 00:39:40,336
She did? Why?

423
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:41,921
Can she not?

424
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,589
Not without a reason.

425
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,840
There must be one.

426
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,676
Then why are you two together?

427
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,428
We're coming back from covering a site.

428
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,973
You know that we're doing a show together.

429
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,768
You-ri told me you asked her about me.

430
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,355
What's the story about?

431
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,108
Well…

432
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:05,945
A case of missing children
from an orphanage.

433
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:08,280
We can't discuss it
due to program security.

434
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,657
I'm sorry I cut you off.

435
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,617
Will you answer me now?

436
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,952
Tell me.

437
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,872
Why are you so interested in me?

438
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:22,628
Hey, Sang-woo.

439
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,756
Didn't you want to congratulate me?

440
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,674
Yeah.

441
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:30,428
Sorry.

442
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:35,850
Hee-joo, the sign language interpreter
for the presidential office.

443
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:38,769
Yeah, it's something to congratulate,

444
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,480
but wasn't your dream something else?

445
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:54,076
LEAVE NEWSCASTER APPLICATION HERE

446
00:40:58,456 --> 00:40:59,874
NAME: HONG HEE-JOO

447
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,968
After that, we listened to music often
in the broadcast room.

448
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:24,143
Did something happen
between you two in college?

449
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:27,855
Right? I can totally sense it.

450
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,064
You have a bad sense.

451
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,483
You're known for that.

452
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:34,486
Me?

453
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:36,989
What I said is based on facts.

454
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:39,158
It's crystal clear.

455
00:43:39,241 --> 00:43:40,451
A college broadcast room

456
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:42,995
is perfect for flirting.

457
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,296
Did you two flirt?

458
00:43:53,297 --> 00:43:55,549
Why would you ask that? They totally did!

459
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,344
Why else would Hee-joo go
to the broadcast room?

460
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,095
It wasn't to be a newscaster.

461
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:03,849
She could be one.

462
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:06,518
Can she not?

463
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:08,520
Excuse me?

464
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:13,859
But how could she be a newscaster?

465
00:44:20,574 --> 00:44:23,243
Of course, she can. What I meant was…

466
00:44:23,911 --> 00:44:26,080
She could definitely be a newscaster.

467
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:28,707
You must have dreamed
of becoming a newscaster.

468
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,918
I didn't know.

469
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:34,046
Why are you bringing that up now?

470
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,965
She's the sign language interpreter
for the presidential office.

471
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:39,677
Why ask about her dream now?

472
00:44:41,428 --> 00:44:44,473
-Are you trying to rain on her parade?
-You think I am?

473
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,979
She wants us to stop.

474
00:44:53,357 --> 00:44:55,609
"It's true I wanted to be a newscaster
in the past."

475
00:44:56,693 --> 00:45:00,155
"Now, I'm happy to be the sign language
interpreter for the presidential office."

476
00:45:03,283 --> 00:45:04,535
Got it?

477
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,516
It's just…

478
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,435
My glass was empty.

479
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:38,277
IN-A

480
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,612
IT'S ME. HOW ARE YOU? IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

481
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:47,870
Hey.

482
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:51,623
Do you think Hee-joo went to the bathroom?

483
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:53,667
I'll go check.

484
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:55,252
Who wants ice cream?

485
00:45:57,212 --> 00:45:58,046
All of a sudden?

486
00:45:58,714 --> 00:45:59,840
Me!

487
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:00,841
I want chocolate!

488
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:03,760
Get me whatever!

489
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:09,308
Hey, sis!

490
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:13,770
Something really fun
happened at school today.

491
00:46:13,854 --> 00:46:15,022
I'll tell you.

492
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:19,318
A friend sent me a note.

493
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,572
Do you know what was written on it?

494
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:28,202
PAIK SA-EON

495
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:47,846
Why are you here?

496
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:59,024
I'm going to pass on
what you say to my sister.

497
00:46:59,107 --> 00:46:59,942
You?

498
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:05,572
I heard you're deaf.

499
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:08,575
Why don't you wear hearing aids
or learn to sign?

500
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:22,172
He looks forward
to studying math with you!

501
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:26,593
Solve it.

502
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,547
Do it again.

503
00:48:04,298 --> 00:48:06,758
Another mistake
and I'll pour water on your head.

504
00:48:12,639 --> 00:48:15,267
In-a, solve it again. You can do better.

505
00:48:33,493 --> 00:48:34,578
I'm glad you called.

506
00:48:34,661 --> 00:48:36,246
I had a question for you.

507
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:38,540
A question for me?

508
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:40,709
What is it?

509
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:41,960
Have you heard

510
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,670
Hee-joo's voice before?

511
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:49,968
What are you saying?

512
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,845
She can't speak. How could I?

513
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:56,099
Then do you know why she can't speak?

514
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:59,394
Since the accident that caused Hong In-a
to lose her hearing,

515
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,812
she hasn't worn hearing aids.

516
00:49:00,896 --> 00:49:02,147
She didn't learn to sign.

517
00:49:02,814 --> 00:49:04,650
Instead, she took Hee-joo around

518
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,777
and had her convey people's words
through notes.

519
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:09,780
She lost her brother,
and her sister went deaf.

520
00:49:09,863 --> 00:49:13,116
How could she be okay after that?
She shouldn't be.

521
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:17,412
Wait.

522
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,831
Is it because of Hong In-a?

523
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,168
What do you mean?

524
00:49:25,754 --> 00:49:28,674
Chairman Hong's only biological daughter
became disabled,

525
00:49:29,549 --> 00:49:31,677
and Hee-joo,
who lived under the same roof…

526
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:36,264
was probably forced to keep quiet too.

527
00:49:37,683 --> 00:49:39,768
That's the ridiculous story I had in mind.

528
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,063
Aside from that,

529
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,399
I can't find another reason.

530
00:49:45,982 --> 00:49:47,484
You've mentioned before

531
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,362
that you have no intention
of letting Hong Hee-joo go.

532
00:49:51,363 --> 00:49:52,239
If Hong In-a returns,

533
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:56,076
will you still feel the same?

534
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,247
Yes, I will.

535
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,083
Why? Why won't you let her go?

536
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:05,210
-A sense of responsibility?
-No.

537
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,211
Then…

538
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:09,005
is it sympathy?

539
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:15,721
What did you just say?

540
00:50:16,430 --> 00:50:17,472
Sympathy?

541
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:20,392
I'll say it once,
so listen carefully, 406.

542
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,060
My true feelings for Hee-joo…

543
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,523
Paik Sa-eon!

544
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,522
You don't need to go to the hospital?

545
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,945
You work with your hands,
so you have to be careful.

546
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:15,530
How many times have I told you?

547
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:18,158
Have you no fear?

548
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,285
Where did you come from?

549
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,705
And how are you so strong?

550
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,665
You took me down.

551
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:32,005
Paik Sa-eon!

552
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:37,260
I…

553
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,306
think I heard it.

554
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:43,475
Your voice.

555
00:51:47,229 --> 00:51:48,563
Did you call my name?

556
00:51:51,066 --> 00:51:52,275
I want to hear it again.

557
00:51:53,693 --> 00:51:54,611
Your voice.

558
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:57,989
Hong Hee-joo.

559
00:51:58,573 --> 00:52:00,867
The world won't fall apart
if you speak up.

560
00:52:02,077 --> 00:52:03,161
Everything you want to say,

561
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,830
the things you've held back…

562
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,833
Say whatever you want.

563
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:25,016
IT'S ME. HOW ARE YOU? IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

564
00:52:55,589 --> 00:52:56,673
Hong Hee-joo.

565
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:59,009
Underestimating yourself

566
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:00,844
is a bad habit.

567
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:04,764
I'd like to help you break that bad habit.

568
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:07,058
What do you think?

569
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:25,452
UNKNOWN CALLER

570
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:34,878
Sis!

571
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,129
How have you been?

572
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,216
Welcome and congratulations.

573
00:53:44,804 --> 00:53:45,680
What's your name?

574
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:47,474
It's Jeong Won-bin.

575
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:48,642
Won-bin.

576
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,727
You live up to your name, don't you?

577
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:53,897
The face-off for who's more handsome
will be intense.

578
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,191
No way, I could never compete.

579
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,818
I hear we look alike though.

580
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:07,243
What's your name?

581
00:54:10,747 --> 00:54:12,874
I'm sorry. I don't know sign language.

582
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:16,544
I see.

583
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:21,132
How can we communicate during work?

584
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:23,259
Shall we all learn sign language?

585
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,846
I'm thinking of learning it.

586
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:28,515
You?

587
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:29,432
Yes.

588
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:33,770
That way, I can ensure the interpreters
are conveying my words accurately.

589
00:54:34,521 --> 00:54:36,398
If there's any difference in nuance,

590
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,316
I'll be able to correct it.

591
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,735
Sign language isn't difficult.

592
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:44,739
If you learn it, there won't be issues
communicating with me either.

593
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:50,120
I'm going to start learning it today.

594
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:53,498
A spokesperson who can sign.

595
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:58,086
Social media will eat that up.
Think of all the likes.

596
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,921
You're right.

597
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:03,466
Welcome.

598
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:04,509
Congratulations.

599
00:55:06,636 --> 00:55:07,887
FINGER ALPHABET

600
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:11,850
I've already memorized this.

601
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,398
I've prepared in advance.

602
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:20,150
It wasn't that hard.

603
00:55:22,819 --> 00:55:25,363
"A. B."

604
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,907
"C. D."

605
00:55:41,796 --> 00:55:43,465
"A hundred questions, a hundred answers"?

606
00:55:44,049 --> 00:55:49,971
"Write down one word or sentence you want
to learn in sign language every day."

607
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,432
Starting today?

608
00:56:07,655 --> 00:56:08,865
Teach me.

609
00:56:30,261 --> 00:56:31,096
What about this?

610
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,275
I look forward to working with you.

611
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:30,822
Hong.

612
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:34,492
Hee.

613
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,079
Joo.

614
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:42,167
Interpreter.

615
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,214
What?

616
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,008
Did I get it wrong?

617
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,266
I look forward
to working with you as well.

618
00:58:03,354 --> 00:58:07,025
Paik Sa-eon.

619
00:58:09,068 --> 00:58:10,069
Spokesperson.

620
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:50,818
Excuse me?

621
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:52,487
Sir?

622
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:54,405
Yes?

623
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:58,868
You don't usually come to team dinners,
so I just came to our usual spot.

624
00:58:58,952 --> 00:59:01,329
What do you think? Is it okay?

625
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,666
Yes, it's fine.

626
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:06,251
I'm relieved to hear it.

627
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:08,378
There's no place better than this
for a team dinner.

628
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,881
-Mr. Kang.
-Yes?

629
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:13,633
What are you doing?

630
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,302
Excuse me? I don't…

631
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,388
The meat's burning.

632
00:59:20,390 --> 00:59:21,307
I'll…

633
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,425
Let's eat.

634
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:56,593
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

635
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:02,932
What?

636
01:00:04,309 --> 01:00:06,519
You grilled it perfectly! It's delicious.

637
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,688
It's really good.

638
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:11,399
Eat up, everyone.

639
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:15,653
Do you want some?

640
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:16,988
-Yes.
-It's so good.

641
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:19,866
-A big one.
-Thanks.

642
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,784
-Me too.
-We don't have enough.

643
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,750
Sir, should we…

644
01:00:29,792 --> 01:00:30,627
do a toast--

645
01:00:42,430 --> 01:00:43,264
What?

646
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,310
We look forward
to working with you as well!

647
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:48,770
That's what that means.

648
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:49,854
-Goodness.
-I see.

649
01:00:49,937 --> 01:00:51,731
-Let's toast.
-Everyone, enjoy!

650
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:52,982
-Enjoy!
-Cheers!

651
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:53,941
Welcome!

652
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:57,654
This is Mr. Paik's treat. It's on him.

653
01:00:57,737 --> 01:00:59,113
Help yourselves.

654
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:06,287
It's so good.

655
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:08,998
Sir, just a moment.

656
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,215
-Eat.
-Eat up.

657
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:19,258
-Yes.
-I need more alcohol.

658
01:01:19,342 --> 01:01:20,718
-I'll pour it.
-Yeah.

659
01:01:21,636 --> 01:01:23,054
The call just came in.

660
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:26,599
The voice analysis was almost complete,
but malware was detected.

661
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:29,143
-The computer shut down completely.
-So what?

662
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:31,521
Most of the original files are gone,

663
01:01:31,604 --> 01:01:34,399
but we were able to get results
from the recovered fragmented files.

664
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,484
The audio quality isn't great.

665
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,777
Can I listen to it?

666
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,028
Yes, but…

667
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:41,656
Please listen to it first.

668
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,638
Sis, are you okay?

669
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,223
Were you hurt anywhere?

670
01:02:09,475 --> 01:02:10,643
You know, from earlier.

671
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,146
You ran in front of a moving car.

672
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:24,532
You said you were getting a divorce.

673
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:28,119
So you changed your mind.

674
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:30,872
You won't divorce him, will you?

675
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:34,709
Why do you want me to divorce him?

676
01:02:35,543 --> 01:02:36,544
Because…

677
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,589
I want to see that bastard,

678
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,008
Paik Sa-eon, be ruined.

679
01:02:42,717 --> 01:02:44,218
What about you, Sis?

680
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,346
Do you know him well?

681
01:02:49,015 --> 01:02:50,349
No, I bet you don't.

682
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:53,144
You probably don't know him at all.

683
01:02:54,437 --> 01:02:55,605
What do you know?

684
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:57,440
How well do you know him?

685
01:02:57,523 --> 01:02:58,399
Me?

686
01:03:00,234 --> 01:03:02,904
Why would you say something so hurtful?

687
01:03:05,198 --> 01:03:06,115
Listen carefully.

688
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,201
In this world,

689
01:03:10,077 --> 01:03:13,164
the person who knows Paik Sa-eon
the best is me.

690
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,334
Hurry, Sis. You're running out of time.

691
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,378
Paik Sa-eon will find out soon.

692
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:22,924
-What?
-What do you think?

693
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,802
Your true identity, Sis!

694
01:03:33,059 --> 01:03:35,311
Everything you want to say,
the things you've held back…

695
01:03:36,938 --> 01:03:38,314
Say whatever you want.

696
01:03:44,695 --> 01:03:46,531
What I have to say to you…

697
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:49,909
isn't what you want to hear.

698
01:03:52,787 --> 01:03:54,205
Decide by tomorrow.

699
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:57,375
Or we can settle for two billion won.
You have until tomorrow.

700
01:04:01,879 --> 01:04:03,256
Can you guess who it is?

701
01:04:04,257 --> 01:04:06,050
Someone who's close to you

702
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,053
-and knows you--
-What's the age range?

703
01:04:09,136 --> 01:04:11,973
The waveform analysis indicates
a woman in her twenties.

704
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,152
We don't do that here.

705
01:04:25,236 --> 01:04:26,445
No.

706
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,615
-We don't pressure people to drink…
-That's right.

707
01:04:32,076 --> 01:04:35,204
So where did you get
your information on Hong Hee-joo?

708
01:04:35,788 --> 01:04:37,373
Are you close to me?

709
01:04:39,250 --> 01:04:40,251
Don't be surprised.

710
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:41,878
The hotel you're at right now.

711
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,796
Please, let me out!

712
01:04:46,799 --> 01:04:49,385
I'll send you another audio file.

713
01:04:49,468 --> 01:04:52,263
Analyze the sound waveform
and compare it with 406.

714
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:55,391
See how much they match in percentage.

715
01:04:55,474 --> 01:04:57,018
Up to two decimal places.

716
01:04:58,185 --> 01:04:59,020
Yes, sir.

717
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:09,655
I wanted to do it.

718
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:24,879
What do you think?

719
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:37,558
Let's have one more round.

720
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,268
-Come on.
-Wait. No.

721
01:05:39,352 --> 01:05:40,186
Get in.

722
01:05:48,069 --> 01:05:49,862
Thank you for the dinner!

723
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,405
Have a good night.

724
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:52,573
-Goodbye.
-Take care.

725
01:05:52,657 --> 01:05:53,991
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

726
01:05:55,534 --> 01:05:59,789
Wow, his first team dinner
and first time drunk.

727
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,249
Is something going on?

728
01:06:02,333 --> 01:06:03,960
Mr. Park, do you know anything?

729
01:06:04,043 --> 01:06:05,294
No.

730
01:06:07,421 --> 01:06:10,508
Didn't you see them leave together?
I saw you two whispering.

731
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:11,425
There's nothing.

732
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,470
Let's go for another round.

733
01:06:14,553 --> 01:06:16,180
-No.
-We're friends.

734
01:06:16,263 --> 01:06:17,682
-Let's go.
-Mr. Kang, wait!

735
01:06:17,765 --> 01:06:19,892
Let's go to karaoke! Karaoke!

736
01:06:19,976 --> 01:06:20,810
Let's go home.

737
01:06:25,648 --> 01:06:26,649
Sir?

738
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:28,567
Sir?

739
01:06:33,155 --> 01:06:34,240
I'm fine.

740
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,117
You may go.

741
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:37,034
Yes, sir.

742
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,229
I'm sorry to bother you so late.

743
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,273
The analysis results came in.

744
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:52,943
It's a 99.99% match.

745
01:09:11,355 --> 01:09:14,275
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

746
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:18,612
Tell me if something happened.

747
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,407
Should I tell you everything honestly?

748
01:09:21,949 --> 01:09:23,826
You have an idea who 406 might be,
don't you?

749
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,204
How about we each
ask a question and answer?

750
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:30,666
By any chance, does Hee-joo want…

751
01:09:30,749 --> 01:09:31,917
sincerity

752
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:33,002
and affection?

753
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:34,503
Is that what she wants?

754
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,131
I can give her everything.

755
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:40,843
If that's what Hee-joo wants,
I'll give as much as she needs.

756
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,303
Hong Hee-joo!

757
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,393
