00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:46,963
WHEN THE PHONE RINGS

2
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:48,923
EPISODE 7

3
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,954
Okay, let's go one more time.

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,243
In-a.

5
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,120
Yu-jin.

6
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:17,554
I'm here too.

7
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:19,180
<i>Speak up.</i>

8
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,183
Help.

9
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,226
<i>Louder!</i>

10
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:30,608
Help!

11
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:33,778
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

12
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,364
Your sister's gone deaf,
and your brother is dead.

13
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:39,075
You can't sacrifice your voice?

14
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:42,745
Not every life holds
the same value, Hee-joo.

15
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,746
No.

16
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:45,456
We…

17
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,085
We can only stay
if the chairman feels sorry for us.

18
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,461
Do you understand?

19
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:53,256
No, tell her you don't want to.

20
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:09,939
No.

21
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,004
<i>Hong Hee-joo!</i>

22
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,513
<i>Hong Hee-joo!</i>

23
00:03:55,902 --> 00:03:56,861
Hong Hee-joo!

24
00:03:57,695 --> 00:04:00,198
<i>Paik Sa-eon?</i>

25
00:04:00,281 --> 00:04:01,366
Hong Hee-joo!

26
00:04:07,205 --> 00:04:08,122
<i>Right.</i>

27
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,125
<i>There was you.</i>

28
00:04:15,463 --> 00:04:18,424
<i>When no one else cared about me,</i>

29
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,677
<i>you noticed me.</i>

30
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,888
<i>Whenever I was scared,</i>

31
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:27,100
<i>you ran over to save me.</i>

32
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:29,018
Hong Hee-joo!

33
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,738
<i>Even when I said nothing,</i>

34
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:43,908
<i>even when I didn't cry out for help,</i>

35
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,453
<i>you were the only one who listened to me.</i>

36
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,247
Hong Hee-joo.

37
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,624
I like you.

38
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,459
<i>But…</i>

39
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,629
<i>why couldn't I bring myself to say it?</i>

40
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,092
<i>That I feel the same…</i>

41
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:21,571
Hee-joo.

42
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:23,573
Are you okay?

43
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,366
Can you see me?

44
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,123
Wait, I'll get the doctor.

45
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,959
Don't go.

46
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,556
Don't go.

47
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,232
Okay.

48
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:01,819
I won't go.

49
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,032
I won't go anywhere.

50
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,163
Okay.

51
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:15,249
It's okay.

52
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,504
It's okay now.

53
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,386
<i>An accidental fall?</i>

54
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,724
Yes, sir. During their company retreat,
someone fell on a hike.

55
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:32,642
Who was it?

56
00:06:32,725 --> 00:06:35,353
A new presidential
sign language interpreter.

57
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,897
But security was tight,
so I couldn't find out.

58
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,857
Why did they fall?

59
00:06:40,525 --> 00:06:41,567
Were they drunk?

60
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,319
Were they drunk hiking?

61
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:47,115
God… They're going to have
a field day with this.

62
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,408
I don't think that was the case.

63
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:53,621
This punk makes things worse
instead of helping me out.

64
00:06:54,455 --> 00:06:57,750
This is a sensitive time.
How could he let that happen?

65
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:00,628
Excuse me, sir?

66
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,424
Maybe it wasn't an accident.

67
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:16,811
Keep going.

68
00:07:16,894 --> 00:07:19,439
Instead of the presidential spokesperson,

69
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,775
how about focusing on him being your son
and making it look like

70
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,611
political…

71
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:32,827
Prepare the script.

72
00:07:41,169 --> 00:07:42,003
Right.

73
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,173
Will I look good on camera?

74
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,096
<i>I ended up speaking.</i>

75
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,312
<i>He knows everything anyway.</i>

76
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:02,315
<i>406! Listen to me carefully.</i>

77
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:05,526
<i>I've put a first-aid kit</i>
<i>inside of Hee-joo's backpack.</i>

78
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,695
<i>I hope Hee-joo finds it and uses it.</i>

79
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:09,780
<i>What do you think, 406?</i>

80
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,575
<i>He said 406,</i>

81
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:15,453
<i>but it felt like he was saying it to me.</i>

82
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:20,249
<i>He's not an idiot,</i>
<i>so there's no way he doesn't know.</i>

83
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,296
<i>But why hasn't he said anything?</i>

84
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:29,008
Stand here, place your hands
on the sides, and put your chin here.

85
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:31,385
<i>Is it because I'm still a patient?</i>

86
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,096
<i>Then the moment I get discharged…</i>

87
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,724
Let's divorce, Hong Hee-joo. No…

88
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,559
I mean, 406.

89
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:41,979
Since you breached the contract,
cough up the two billion won.

90
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,359
All this time,

91
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,153
you sure fooled me.

92
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,781
How dare you?

93
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:55,826
Get out now.
I can't stand the sight of you.

94
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,377
I said I liked you.

95
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:06,921
I take it back.

96
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,924
Miss, don't move.
I'm taking the X-ray now.

97
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,301
<i>Wait, where's the phone?</i>

98
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,304
I said not to move.

99
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,098
There's no footage?

100
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,560
Yes, I checked the entire trail,
from the entrance to the summit,

101
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:23,437
but there was no one
who could be identified as a suspect.

102
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:25,982
And there were no cameras
where the accident occurred.

103
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:26,899
Any witnesses?

104
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,068
We're gathering statements,

105
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,654
but the scene was so chaotic
and crowded that day.

106
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:35,116
How's Ms. Hong Hee-joo now?

107
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,201
She's being examined.

108
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:39,370
For now, there are no major issues.

109
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,497
What a relief.

110
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:46,043
- The police are waiting for a statement…
- Don't tell them she's awake yet.

111
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:48,963
I'll get her statement.

112
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:52,008
Her identity
is being fully protected, right?

113
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:52,925
Yes, sir.

114
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:57,888
But why do you think
he went after Interpreter Hong Hee-joo?

115
00:10:00,016 --> 00:10:02,935
I'm sure they were after me
and missed their shot.

116
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,606
What about the thing
I asked you to look into?

117
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,190
I've checked it.

118
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,405
Did you find anything?

119
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:18,659
The malicious code we found on the phone
during the voice modulation analysis

120
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:20,995
was actually planted
to facilitate hacking.

121
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,455
- Hacking?
- Yes.

122
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:24,457
The program is called RCS,

123
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,668
and it can control PCs or smartphones
to monitor users remotely

124
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:28,961
and track their location.

125
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:32,757
<i>Is that how he followed us to the summit?</i>

126
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,091
<i>With the tracking device?</i>

127
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,969
But if we hack the code
and collect the data on the other side--

128
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,971
Then we can track his location.

129
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:40,931
How long will it take?

130
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:42,975
At most, two to three days. I'll hurry.

131
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:44,935
Great work.

132
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:50,775
It's only a matter of time
before we find him.

133
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:01,202
You can go now.

134
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:19,095
Why are you being so tight-lipped now?

135
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,430
You had no trouble speaking earlier.

136
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:26,102
You'll stop talking again?

137
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:52,586
I like it.

138
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:56,048
I like feeling your heartbeat.

139
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:23,742
It's okay.

140
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,537
I already knew

141
00:12:27,496 --> 00:12:28,998
that you could talk.

142
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,794
I know far more about you…

143
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:36,630
than you think.

144
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:40,342
406.

145
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,935
He told me your location.

146
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,521
He might've been the one who pushed you,

147
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,609
but he helped me find you too.

148
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,864
So, I'm torn.

149
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,115
406…

150
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,994
Should I catch
and hand him over to the cops

151
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,372
or just forgive him?

152
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,549
- The truth is--
- Do you see that?

153
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,387
ABSOLUTE REST

154
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,848
What you need right now is rest.

155
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,433
Absolute rest.

156
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:33,604
I have many things I want to ask you,
things I'm curious about, but…

157
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,606
I won't ask right now.

158
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,774
So, for now,

159
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,692
just rest.

160
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,197
What about my work?

161
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,949
You'll be on sick leave.

162
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,535
So, just…

163
00:13:48,452 --> 00:13:49,870
think about getting better.

164
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:54,416
I'll be away for a few hours.

165
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:57,753
Your old phone was smashed,

166
00:13:58,504 --> 00:13:59,547
so use this now.

167
00:14:00,297 --> 00:14:01,882
Call me if anything happens.

168
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,259
Got it?

169
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,888
- Answer me.
- Okay.

170
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:16,647
I'll be back.

171
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:42,214
Did he not see it?

172
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:45,467
<i>I was…</i>

173
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:49,972
<i>going to use this phone to escape you.</i>

174
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,224
You wanted Hong In-a from the start.

175
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,769
Hong Hee-joo is just a stand-in puppet.

176
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:58,898
It's not like you married her for love.
You don't even love her now.

177
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,152
<i>But this phone was</i>

178
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:07,114
<i>the only thing that connected you and me.</i>

179
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:09,116
<i>Hee-joo isn't supplementary pages.</i>

180
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,910
She's a brand-new language.

181
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,412
Does Hee-joo want sincerity,

182
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:14,455
attention,

183
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:16,332
understanding,

184
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:17,416
and affection?

185
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,710
<i>Is that what she wants?</i>

186
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:25,549
You don't have any neck wrinkles at all.

187
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:28,010
I can see them, though.

188
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,596
Try your best.

189
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,141
I almost forgot. Your daughter's here.
Did you see her?

190
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,269
What? Is she really here?

191
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,399
What's gotten into you?

192
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:45,027
You never listened to me
when I told you to come.

193
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:46,445
Right.

194
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:50,282
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

195
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,787
Sa-eon seems to care about you a lot.

196
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:56,664
What's your secret?

197
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,499
Was it that work outfit?

198
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:00,334
Did that do the trick?

199
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,005
Get up, you brat.

200
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,341
You should be thanking me.

201
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:08,634
Do you get it now?

202
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,719
A man needs a woman's touch--

203
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,472
What? You!

204
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:16,058
- What are you doing here?
- It's been a while.

205
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:18,477
How have you been?

206
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,067
PARK DO-JAE

207
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,653
Yeah, I'm on my way.

208
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:28,862
<i>It's not that.</i>

209
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:31,448
<i>There's something</i>
<i>you have to check right now.</i>

210
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,701
What is it?

211
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,661
UNCOVER THE TRUTH
WITH UNBIASED INVESTIGATION

212
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,080
PRESS CONFERENCE
PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE RETREAT ATTACK

213
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,921
I am truly devastated

214
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,007
and at a loss for words.

215
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:52,720
I am not only a presidential candidate
of this country

216
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:57,391
but also a father to my beloved only son.

217
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:58,892
Yes?

218
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,145
So, you're saying

219
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:04,606
that you believe the fall
at the spokesperson's office retreat

220
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,152
could be a "political terror"
rather than just an accidental stumble?

221
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,445
Is that it?

222
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,073
I want to believe it's not true,

223
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:16,452
but how could this possibly
be just a random accident?

224
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,497
But according to what's been reported,
nothing happened to the spokesperson…

225
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,416
How fortunate is that?

226
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,838
Well, of course,

227
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:30,799
I know it's a great tragedy
for the presidential office staff

228
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,551
and their family

229
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,679
who were affected by the accident,

230
00:17:36,513 --> 00:17:38,724
and I sincerely wish
for their swift recovery.

231
00:17:39,516 --> 00:17:40,350
However,

232
00:17:41,143 --> 00:17:44,897
to determine whether it was an attack

233
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:49,860
aimed at the spokesperson
or an accident involving a staff member,

234
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:56,075
I urge a thorough investigation
to get to the bottom of it.

235
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:06,293
We are still investigating
whether it was an accident…

236
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:07,836
This is the spokesperson's office.

237
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,339
- As of now…
- We're verifying the facts.

238
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:12,925
- Refrain from speculative reporting.
- Well…

239
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:16,261
We're still investigating
whether it was an accidental fall or not.

240
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,014
No, that's the position
of the presidential candidate.

241
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,724
It has nothing to do with us…

242
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,479
Someone got hurt. Does that really matter?

243
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:28,732
It's a matter of life and death, you know?

244
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:33,195
No, I'm not saying they died.

245
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,488
Hello?

246
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:35,989
Hello--

247
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,244
Sir?

248
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:47,126
From now on, our office will only say
these three things.

249
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,544
Repeat them like a parrot.

250
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:51,421
One, we're verifying the facts.
Two, we're finalizing our stance.

251
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,298
Three, the press release is tomorrow.

252
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,508
Tomorrow?

253
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,510
It's not today? It's not right now?

254
00:18:56,593 --> 00:19:00,264
Rash responses will only fuel
misunderstandings and speculation.

255
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:04,184
We'll act with confirmed information,
which we will secure by the end of today.

256
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:07,312
Then…

257
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:09,481
what shall we do?

258
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,736
Mr. Kang, ensure that
the victim's personal information

259
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,280
is protected and not leaked.

260
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:19,032
Send a confidentiality notice
to other departments.

261
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,534
Sir.

262
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,495
I don't believe this.

263
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:28,584
We haven't worked with her for long,
but Hong Hee-joo is our colleague.

264
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,919
You don't explain anything.

265
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,089
You just want us to hide it,
cover it up, and conceal it.

266
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,050
We're worried about her too. That's right.

267
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:40,971
Is she okay? Did she wake up?

268
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,098
Is she eating well?

269
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:48,145
She's safe.

270
00:19:49,479 --> 00:19:51,398
Fortunately, she wasn't hurt much.

271
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:55,444
I'm sure you were all worried.
I'm sorry for causing concern.

272
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:58,614
In the midst of it all,

273
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:01,909
what's with
Candidate Paik Ui-yong's statement?

274
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,118
Darn it.

275
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,372
I'll address that soon as well.

276
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,251
When did you get back?

277
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:14,171
When and how did you get the surgery,
and when did you start talking?

278
00:20:14,254 --> 00:20:15,756
What's the rush?

279
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,259
Don't you care to know how I've been?

280
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:21,762
Your father's probably curious about that.

281
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:22,804
What are you up to?

282
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,518
Don't worry. I'm not here to be
the future president's daughter-in-law.

283
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,271
You can't have it anyway.

284
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:35,442
Hee-joo takes after me, after all.
You heard what I said earlier.

285
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:39,529
She has Sa-eon wrapped around her finger
in three years of marriage.

286
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,907
Do you really think so?

287
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:44,993
Even after she finds out
the truth about him?

288
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:46,495
What?

289
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:48,956
I know you know.

290
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:52,751
You're the one who kindly gave the hint
the day before the wedding.

291
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,053
CHUNGWOON ART CENTER
TO CEO HONG IN-A

292
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,098
CHUNGWOON ART CENTER CEO HONG IN-A

293
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,153
<i>You sent that to me.</i>

294
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:23,198
To scare me into running away.

295
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,409
What are you talking about?

296
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:27,744
What did you get before the wedding?

297
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:30,998
It wasn't you?

298
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,958
Whatever it is, I don't care.

299
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,627
It's in the past. Let's not bring it up.

300
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,214
If you're not here to cause trouble,
keep a low profile.

301
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:42,968
Don't provoke your father
right before the election.

302
00:21:43,051 --> 00:21:44,761
I'm not here

303
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,807
to cause trouble but to help Hee-joo.

304
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:54,354
It wouldn't matter if this was just
a business agreement to her, but…

305
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,982
I don't think that's the case.

306
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:57,983
So?

307
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,068
Then she needs to know.

308
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,529
What she decides after that is up to her.

309
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,365
Help, my foot.

310
00:22:06,283 --> 00:22:08,493
What do you know about Paik Sa-eon?

311
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,121
Tell me.

312
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,751
What more do I need to know?

313
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,797
Is there more?

314
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,470
The public is showing sympathy
and support as we speak.

315
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,056
As expected,
the supporters are rallying together.

316
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:34,061
However, the spokesperson's stance
hasn't been clarified yet.

317
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:36,313
Why don't you
align your positions with him?

318
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:38,106
You're right.

319
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:43,278
I thought I'd hear from him right away,
so why has it been so quiet?

320
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,667
You finally came, Mr. Spokesperson.

321
00:22:58,627 --> 00:23:01,713
How are you? Were you hurt?

322
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,674
No.

323
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:10,472
Thanks to my father's heartfelt tears
and concern.

324
00:23:14,142 --> 00:23:17,229
The mood's set, so just go with the flow,

325
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:19,189
and don't go off track.

326
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:21,650
You're the one who's going off track,
not me.

327
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,530
Unless you want to be countered,
you should stop here.

328
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,614
Countered?

329
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,449
By who?

330
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:33,120
You?

331
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,374
This is my sincere advice.

332
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,461
Don't stir this matter up any further.

333
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:45,841
Hey, you ungrateful bastard!

334
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:53,431
Hey, Paik Sa-eon.

335
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:58,645
Who gave you that name?

336
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,149
"Paik Jang-ho's grandson,
Paik Ui-yong's son."

337
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:04,985
Who gave you that title?

338
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:14,411
My son doesn't eat that kind of food.

339
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,037
Eat this.

340
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,459
My son doesn't wear clothes like that.
Wear this.

341
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,670
My son doesn't like those types of books.

342
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,754
Read these.

343
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:33,013
PAIK SA-EON

344
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:51,239
Did I ask for it?

345
00:24:51,907 --> 00:24:52,741
What?

346
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:55,702
That name.

347
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:57,579
That title!

348
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:02,334
I didn't get it because I wanted it.

349
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,004
Stop shoving it down my throat.

350
00:25:07,172 --> 00:25:09,257
I'm on the verge of throwing it all up.

351
00:25:14,179 --> 00:25:16,139
Who's the staff member that fell?

352
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:18,767
Are they legit?

353
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:21,436
Are you sure they're not a mole
planted by those who--

354
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,313
- It was family.
- What?

355
00:25:24,648 --> 00:25:26,524
Who are you talking about?

356
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,820
A new presidential
sign language interpreter.

357
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:34,074
A sign language interpreter…

358
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,159
That can't be.

359
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,079
Unless you've lost your mind,

360
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,082
you wouldn't hire her, right?

361
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:43,166
What?

362
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:49,256
Does it displease you that Hee-joo entered
the presidential office

363
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:50,924
before you could?

364
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:06,606
PAIK UI-YONG, A FATHER'S HEARTFELT TEARS

365
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,484
My goodness.

366
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:11,486
So what's the spokesperson's stance?

367
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,571
It hasn't been announced yet.

368
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,033
I hear no one knows yet
who had the accident.

369
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,201
No.

370
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,123
By any chance, have you contacted Hee-joo?

371
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,627
I texted her,
but she hasn't texted me back yet.

372
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:29,963
Goodness.

373
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,428
Be careful. You'll get hurt.

374
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:42,600
Coming?

375
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:50,275
The owner of the villa
listed in the land register

376
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:52,569
is a person named Jeong Jin-seok.

377
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:56,406
That's right.
I looked into that too in the past.

378
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,742
- Did you meet him?
- No.

379
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:01,661
He wasn't living at the listed address.

380
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:04,789
I wouldn't hire a private investigator
just to find him.

381
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,000
From our investigation,

382
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:11,004
Jeong Jin-seok has overdue
property and real estate taxes.

383
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,631
But the National Tax Service
wouldn't tolerate it.

384
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,884
That's right. They're tracking him too.

385
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,053
I told the tax authorities

386
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:21,639
we were preparing a program related
to a unsolved child abduction case

387
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,851
and that we needed
to find someone named Jeong Jin-seok,

388
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:28,021
and they said they'd share
the information when they find him.

389
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:30,648
Really? That's great.

390
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,650
I think we'll make progress.

391
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,195
Mr. Han?

392
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,615
Are you finally showing interest?

393
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,117
Didn't you want to pull the plug?

394
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:44,579
No, that's before I knew about the twins.

395
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:48,833
Have you tried to ask around
about the orphanage friends?

396
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,877
Does anyone know the twin?

397
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:52,921
Yeah, I'm looking.

398
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:14,943
<i>Was it him?</i>

399
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,821
<i>How did he know to come there?</i>

400
00:28:25,328 --> 00:28:28,039
<i>I'm on my way. Do you need anything?</i>

401
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,124
<i>No.</i>

402
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,545
<i>Anything you want to eat?</i>

403
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:42,804
<i>Tteokbokki?</i>

404
00:28:44,681 --> 00:28:45,682
<i>Nothing spicy.</i>

405
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,269
<i>Then, fried chicken?</i>

406
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,106
<i>Nothing greasy.</i>

407
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:55,942
<i>Then anything sweet.</i>

408
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,154
<i>No, it'll raise your blood sugar.</i>

409
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,783
Why ask if you were going
to say no to everything?

410
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:07,287
Is he teasing me?

411
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,438
HONG HEE-JOO
WHEN WILL YOU GET HERE?

412
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,245
If you want something sweet,

413
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:50,705
eat some fruits.

414
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:54,501
But these…

415
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,921
haven't been washed.

416
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,091
Are you saying that to me?

417
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,195
By the way, when did you go home?

418
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:26,282
On my way here.
I had to get some of my stuff too.

419
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,451
Why would you bring this?

420
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:32,413
Family members need certain items
for hospital stays too.

421
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,917
- Why are you only thinking about yourself?
- You'll sleep here?

422
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,922
We've already slept together.

423
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:42,882
Last night.

424
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:48,513
<i>Where did we sleep together?</i>

425
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,516
<i>And where's he going to sleep tonight?</i>

426
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:52,892
<i>Here?</i>

427
00:30:54,435 --> 00:30:55,854
<i>There?</i>

428
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,106
<i>Wait, there?</i>

429
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,902
Is he taking a shower?

430
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:05,530
Why?

431
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,408
No, no, no. He can shower.

432
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:10,952
What am I thinking about?

433
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,082
- Let's wash up.
- Excuse me?

434
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,338
How's the water temperature?

435
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:27,594
They always ask you that at the salon
when they wash your hair.

436
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:30,263
Is it hot?

437
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,848
It's okay.

438
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,548
Sorry.

439
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,591
Hold on.

440
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,261
What? Hold on.

441
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:32,909
What is it? Are you uncomfortable?

442
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,371
No.

443
00:32:37,413 --> 00:32:38,498
It's awkward.

444
00:32:41,709 --> 00:32:42,877
What is?

445
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,758
Why are you being so good to me?

446
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,427
Am I being good to you?

447
00:32:52,011 --> 00:32:53,638
Don't most husbands

448
00:32:54,263 --> 00:32:56,391
do this for their wives?

449
00:33:12,699 --> 00:33:14,283
I felt regretful.

450
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:17,787
I don't think I've done enough for you.

451
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:21,666
All done.

452
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,796
Now go to sleep.

453
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,255
What's wrong with me?

454
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,883
All my tests came back normal.

455
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,591
<i>Wait, I'm not ready yet…</i>

456
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:06,979
You weren't sleeping?

457
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:12,443
Go to sleep.

458
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,708
<i>Will I…</i>

459
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,294
<i>be able to sleep?</i>

460
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,973
That's it, everyone.

461
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:44,851
I concentrated as best as I could
to recall the details,

462
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,604
and it looked something like this.

463
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,984
Paradisers, please,
can I have your attention?

464
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:57,488
We're receiving reports from anyone
who has information about

465
00:35:58,197 --> 00:35:59,073
this dragon ring.

466
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,308
Where did he go?

467
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,773
CALLS
PAIK SA-EON

468
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,826
<i>Go to sleep. I'm waiting for a call.</i>

469
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:45,578
Waiting for a call?

470
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:02,678
Who knew the day would come

471
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,723
when I'd be happy to get your call, 406?

472
00:37:05,806 --> 00:37:07,808
Were you waiting for my call?

473
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:11,020
Why are you happy to get it?

474
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:12,480
I don't know.

475
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:15,524
Thanks to you,

476
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,985
I could find Hee-joo.

477
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,030
Aren't you curious as to how I knew

478
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:23,866
to tell you?

479
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:28,371
<i>To tell the truth…</i>

480
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,747
To tell the truth,

481
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,917
I know a lot about you, 406.

482
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,296
What do you know?

483
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,716
You're in your mid to late-twenties.

484
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:42,677
A woman.

485
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:44,971
How did you know?

486
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,390
Are you pretty?

487
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:54,855
Why does it matter if the person
threatening you is pretty or not?

488
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,067
I just have a feeling you might be.

489
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:01,237
Men.

490
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:04,991
<i>Did you just laugh?</i>

491
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,577
Yes, this is nice.

492
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:11,831
What's nice about it?

493
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,332
Talking to you

494
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,961
on the phone like this,
just like we always do,

495
00:38:18,337 --> 00:38:20,423
makes it feel like nothing ever happened.

496
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,718
It's peaceful and nice.

497
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,261
It's peaceful?

498
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:27,513
Hong Hee-joo was on the brink of death.

499
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,640
What are you wearing right now?

500
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,892
<i>I can't see you for myself,</i>

501
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,519
so I want to imagine it.

502
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,272
<i>Why would you imagine me, you lunatic?</i>

503
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,650
From what I imagine,

504
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:42,528
you have a delicate frame
to match your voice

505
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,282
and a fiery personality to go with it.

506
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:49,035
Fiery? To go with what?

507
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,954
<i>Wait, my body?</i>

508
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:54,665
I won't go that far.

509
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:59,003
Well, anyway, it's fun just imagining it.

510
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,631
What are you doing right now?

511
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,799
Are you…

512
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,886
Are you flirting with me or something?

513
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:09,972
You're a married man!

514
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,223
<i>Hee-joo…</i>

515
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,601
is probably asleep by now.

516
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:15,936
<i>You jerk.</i>

517
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,273
It seems like you're not fully ready yet,

518
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,859
so let's try to get closer later.

519
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:24,195
I'd like to propose an offer.

520
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:25,279
An offer?

521
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:27,323
What offer?

522
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,158
<i>Join me.</i>

523
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,623
Let's catch the culprit together.

524
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:43,130
I know you're not in on it with him.

525
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:45,424
He's the one who pushed Hee-joo.

526
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,761
<i>And you're the one</i>
<i>who told me where Hee-joo was.</i>

527
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,057
After Hee-joo fell
from the mountain that day…

528
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,102
Hong Hee-joo!

529
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:59,063
<i>While I desperately searched everywhere</i>
<i>looking for her…</i>

530
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,856
Hong Hee-joo!

531
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,024
<i>I made a resolution.</i>

532
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:03,692
That I will…

533
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,030
make him feel the pain I felt, no,

534
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,200
the pain Hee-joo felt,

535
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,744
<i>a hundred times over.</i>

536
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,913
So starting now,

537
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,499
tell me everything you know about him.

538
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:21,502
Don't leave anything out.

539
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,925
- Hey.
- Wait, is this real?

540
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,761
Is this press release
really from the spokesperson?

541
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,054
Yeah, that's right.

542
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,472
Now, everyone, stand by!

543
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,683
- We're going live right away, okay?
- Okay.

544
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:38,185
What…

545
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,062
What's going on?

546
00:40:41,063 --> 00:40:42,314
This is unbelievable.

547
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:47,278
Good grief. It's like a soap opera. Right?

548
00:40:47,361 --> 00:40:50,406
I want to rip that rotten bastard's mouth!

549
00:40:50,489 --> 00:40:52,533
I want to stab him
in the back with a knife.

550
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:56,328
Bastards who fool around
should be castrated with scissors!

551
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,540
People like him don't deserve
to be treated as humans.

552
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,208
How about that?

553
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,835
Is he about to get caught?

554
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,170
Goodness!

555
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,505
What did she do wrong?

556
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:08,716
They need to be taught a lesson.

557
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,759
<i>- Honey!</i>
<i>- What are you…</i>

558
00:41:11,343 --> 00:41:12,470
<i>doing right now?</i>

559
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:15,055
<i>You're a married man!</i>

560
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:16,557
<i>Hee-joo…</i>

561
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:18,684
<i>is probably asleep by now.</i>

562
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,227
<i>Honey!</i>

563
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,896
Good grief!

564
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:23,981
Goodness.

565
00:41:24,064 --> 00:41:26,317
Miss, this is mine.

566
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,321
<i>Hello, viewers.</i>

567
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:31,822
- What?
<i>- We have breaking news</i>

568
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,782
<i>- that just came in.</i>
- What is it?

569
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:37,578
I'm sure you have heard the news
about the fall accident that occurred

570
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:40,414
during the retreat
of the spokesperson's office.

571
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,500
The presidential office just issued

572
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:45,628
an official statement,
confirming that it was not an accident

573
00:41:45,711 --> 00:41:47,922
but a criminal incident.

574
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:50,299
- Criminal?
<i>- It's been revealed</i>

575
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:53,260
<i>that the victim</i>
<i>was Spokesperson Paik Sa-eon.</i>

576
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,387
<i>Spokesperson Paik revealed to the police</i>

577
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:59,058
<i>that he had been receiving threats</i>
<i>for two weeks, starting from June 1.</i>

578
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:02,811
<i>He also reported that he believes</i>
<i>the recent fall incident</i>

579
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,314
<i>was an attempt to cause him harm.</i>

580
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:09,485
<i>But the spokesperson drew a clear line,</i>
<i>stating that he does not view the incident</i>

581
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:12,696
<i>as a political attack against himself</i>
<i>or Paik Ui-yong,</i>

582
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,366
<i>the presidential candidate</i>
<i>of the Liberty and Justice Party,</i>

583
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:18,035
<i>and urged everyone to refrain</i>
<i>from unnecessary speculation.</i>

584
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,497
But due to the ongoing death threats
and his concern for his personal safety,

585
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,916
he requested police protection,
an investigation,

586
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:26,627
and for the suspect's composite sketch
to be made public.

587
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:27,836
Cue the sketch.

588
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,924
<i>Viewers, please take a careful look</i>
<i>at the screen we're showing you.</i>

589
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,510
<i>This is the composite sketch</i>
<i>of the suspect identified</i>

590
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:38,222
<i>in connection with the threats and bombing</i>
<i>targeting Spokesperson Paik.</i>

591
00:42:38,847 --> 00:42:42,810
<i>406, starting now,</i>
<i>I want you to answer my questions.</i>

592
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:46,146
The most important question.
Did you see his face?

593
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,107
I didn't see his face,

594
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,985
but he had a distinct feature.

595
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:55,781
<i>The suspect is a man in his early</i>
<i>to mid-thirties, around 185 cm tall</i>

596
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,242
<i>with a solid build.</i>

597
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:02,746
<i>He is odd-eyed, and one eye</i>
<i>appears light brown in different lighting.</i>

598
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:04,832
Good. Anything else?

599
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,960
There was a strange, fishy odor
coming from him,

600
00:43:08,043 --> 00:43:10,004
and he stuttered when he got excited.

601
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,507
It seemed like he had
anger management issues.

602
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,801
The suspect has a stutter,

603
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:19,638
displays signs of anger management issues,

604
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:22,516
and appears to possess skills in threats,

605
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,728
hacking, homemade bomb-making, and arson.

606
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,859
I'll ask one last question.

607
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:34,612
- Yes.
- Why didn't you…

608
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:36,655
report this sooner?

609
00:43:37,448 --> 00:43:39,658
I wanted to handle it quietly.

610
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,578
In the end, I failed to.

611
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:45,706
Do you have any suspect in mind?

612
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,250
Someone with a grudge, perhaps?

613
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:51,712
I don't know.

614
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,466
I'm sure about one thing.

615
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:57,635
Whoever it is, they know a lot about me.

616
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,969
Like what?

617
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:01,430
Where my personal office was

618
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:04,016
and even the schedule
of the company retreat.

619
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,434
They knew personal details

620
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,645
that only family would know.

621
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,438
I'm guessing that

622
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,899
someone is providing the information.

623
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,443
<i>He said "Us."</i>

624
00:44:15,110 --> 00:44:16,528
- "Us"?
- Yeah.

625
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:21,408
<i>Sis, I like you.</i>

626
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,994
<i>Because you have the same goal as us.</i>

627
00:44:24,078 --> 00:44:26,955
He can't stand being ignored,
gets agitated easily,

628
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:28,207
and can't control his anger.

629
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,544
Isn't it strange that someone like him
could carefully plan things

630
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,340
like hacking a car
and setting up a phone for threats?

631
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,343
Are you saying there's an accomplice?

632
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,260
Yes.

633
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,471
I'm sure there's one.

634
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,016
We need to catch him

635
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:48,602
along with the other guy.

636
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:59,405
DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY
DIRECTOR JI SANG-WOO

637
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,287
ODD-EYED WITH ONE EYE
APPEARING LIGHT BROWN

638
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:10,582
ODD-EYED

639
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:16,505
<i>The suspect is a man in his early</i>
<i>to mid-thirties, around 185 cm tall</i>

640
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,549
<i>with a solid build.</i>

641
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:23,137
<i>He is odd-eyed, and one eye</i>
<i>appears light brown in different lighting.</i>

642
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,855
FISHING SUPPLIES

643
00:45:33,772 --> 00:45:34,606
Hey!

644
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,859
Is this what you meant by going off track?

645
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:39,278
You're trying to screw me over,
aren't you?

646
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:41,530
So you should've just stayed quiet.

647
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:44,283
If you hadn't tried to use the accident

648
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,410
for your own gain,

649
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,664
I wouldn't have had to go up
against what you said, would I?

650
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:53,125
How dare you talk back--

651
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:54,042
Enough!

652
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,721
Why didn't you tell us?

653
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:09,183
I wasn't the first person he attacked.

654
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,184
It was Hee-joo.

655
00:46:11,768 --> 00:46:13,312
He knew she was my wife.

656
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,231
No one but family knows that.

657
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,149
So what?

658
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,068
Are you saying you suspected us?

659
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:23,572
What do we gain from threatening you?

660
00:46:23,655 --> 00:46:27,117
Everyone in the family who knows
about your marriage wouldn't benefit

661
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:29,620
from the truth being exposed,
that includes us.

662
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:33,916
Besides that, why would you bring her
to work with you at the office?

663
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:35,125
I decided…

664
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,045
it was safest to keep Hee-joo

665
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,215
by my side, right in front of me.

666
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:45,594
I guess you really care about her.

667
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:48,013
Was that the only thing he knew?

668
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,140
The marriage?

669
00:46:52,017 --> 00:46:53,101
For now.

670
00:46:53,185 --> 00:46:55,938
I don't know how much he knows.

671
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,857
Our family has…

672
00:47:00,067 --> 00:47:01,276
more than a few secrets.

673
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:06,323
Chairman Hong.

674
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,576
Do you think it's him?

675
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:14,164
That skeptical old man could
have decided to support another candidate.

676
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,583
Do you think he's plotting behind my back?

677
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,509
Speak of the devil. He's calling.

678
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,010
Want me to go ask?

679
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,929
If he's plotting something?

680
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,729
<i>Spokesperson Paik</i>
<i>of the presidential office</i>

681
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:41,066
<i>revealed that the recent fall accident</i>
<i>during the company retreat</i>

682
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,569
<i>was a targeted crime against him.</i>

683
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,280
<i>And the police have launched</i>
<i>a public investigation.</i>

684
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,865
<i>Based on Paik's testimony,</i>
<i>the police created</i>

685
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,451
<i>and released a composite sketch</i>
<i>of the suspect.</i>

686
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,662
<i>Let's go live to our reporter</i>
<i>for more details.</i>

687
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:57,457
<i>You're the one who pushed her,</i>
<i>but my face is exposed.</i>

688
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,128
<i>Why did you try to kill Hong Hee-joo, huh?</i>

689
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,714
<i>Isn't our goal Paik Sa-eon?</i>

690
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:05,966
<i>The police have released</i>
<i>a composite sketch.</i>

691
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,469
<i>The suspect is a man in his early</i>
<i>to mid-thirties, around 185 cm tall</i>

692
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:10,971
<i>with a solid build.</i>

693
00:48:11,763 --> 00:48:15,225
<i>He is odd-eyed, and one eye</i>
<i>appears light brown in different lighting.</i>

694
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:18,895
<i>Police said the suspect made</i>
<i>threatening calls to Spokesperson Paik.</i>

695
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:21,481
HONG HEE-JOO DOESN'T SEEM TO
WANT TO GET DIVORCED.

696
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:24,776
<i>So?</i>

697
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:31,116
I WANTED PAIK SA-EON TO FEEL

698
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:35,245
WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LOSE
SOMETHING PRECIOUS TOO.

699
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:37,122
<i>But Hong Hee-joo didn't die.</i>

700
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:40,125
<i>What now?</i>

701
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:42,002
<i>We're about to get screwed.</i>

702
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,503
No, I mean just me!

703
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,346
FIRST, GET THE PHONE BACK.

704
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,438
Why didn't you tell me?

705
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:03,273
How could you not consult with me?

706
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:04,775
At first,

707
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:07,402
I suspected you too.

708
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,364
What? Why would I do something like that?

709
00:49:10,447 --> 00:49:11,865
I couldn't be controlled,

710
00:49:12,407 --> 00:49:13,825
and you disapproved.

711
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:16,620
Strangling me wouldn't be off the table

712
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:19,331
if it meant you could control me.

713
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:21,458
If you know so much,

714
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:25,253
why did you act like an amateur today?

715
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:30,217
Why would someone as skilled at media play
as you step into the spotlight?

716
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:33,887
This issue concerns
both of our families anyway,

717
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:35,639
so you had either me

718
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,350
or your father to hide behind.

719
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,104
You should rest.

720
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,397
I'll get going.

721
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,568
No.

722
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:52,823
You wouldn't act like
an amateur overnight.

723
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:56,034
The most common
yet the most reliable method.

724
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,538
Cover an issue with another issue.

725
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,458
You've got the world's attention
focused on you.

726
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,003

<i>Was it you?</i>

<i>Are you okay?</i>

751
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:38,154
The voice phishing call
you asked about before,

752
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:39,698
is that him too?

753
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,950
- Yeah.
<i>- Hey!</i>

754
00:52:42,033 --> 00:52:43,785
You should've told me sooner.

755
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:48,415
I know you're nuts,
but this is the first time

756
00:52:48,498 --> 00:52:50,792
I've seen you act this crazy since then.

757
00:52:50,876 --> 00:52:51,835
"Since then"?

758
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,753
<i>In the conflict zone,</i>

759
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,840
bullets were pouring,
and you ran with a mic and camera.

760
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:59,342
Sa-eon, stop being so reckless. Okay?

761
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,886
If I stop,

762
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:03,263
there won't be a place to hide.

763
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,639
What?

764
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,019
There's nowhere to hide

765
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:12,439
except behind me.

766
00:53:29,539 --> 00:53:30,665
How are you feeling?

767
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:36,713
I'm okay.

768
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,676
What happened earlier?

769
00:53:43,178 --> 00:53:44,554
Did someone come?

770
00:53:45,931 --> 00:53:47,015
You look tired.

771
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:52,103
Yeah, I am.

772
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,064
So go to sleep now.

773
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:55,774
So I can sleep too.

774
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:04,324
Are you not scared?

775
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,285
Why? Are you scared?

776
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:09,162
Do you want the light on?

777
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:16,711
Everyone's talking about you,

778

779
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,509
Aren't you scared?

781
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:27,597
Are you scared?

00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:57,627
I'm…

783
00:54:59,587 --> 00:55:00,839
not scared.

784
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,634
And I don't regret it.

785
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,139
So you just…

786
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:12,934
have good dreams.

<i>Hello?</i>

789
00:56:39,979 --> 00:56:41,481
I saw the news.

790
00:56:43,983 --> 00:56:44,818
But…

791
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:47,695
I'm curious about something.

792
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:48,655
<i>What is it?</i>

793
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:50,907
When are you going to catch me?

794
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:56,663
I ended up helping him, after all.

795
00:56:57,413 --> 00:57:00,583
Whether it's punishment
or an investigation, it has to be done.

796
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,754
<i>Also, when will you take this phone?</i>

797
00:57:05,421 --> 00:57:08,174
<i>It's important evidence.</i>
<i>Don't you need it?</i>

798
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,509
If I need it,

799
00:57:10,343 --> 00:57:11,636
will you give it to me?

800
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,263
I guess so,

801
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:15,390
to catch him.

802
00:57:16,057 --> 00:57:17,600
How will you give it to me?

803
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,769
Will you…

804
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,647
<i>show yourself to me?</i>

805
00:57:27,402 --> 00:57:28,236
Yeah.

806
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:30,572
Let's meet.

807
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,411
I'll come to you now.

808
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,497
With this phone.

809
00:57:48,173 --> 00:57:51,301
<i>What expression will you make</i>
<i>when you see me?</i>

810
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,930
<i>I was torn because it might</i>
<i>torture you even more, but…</i>

811
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,185
<i>But that was an excuse.</i>

812
00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:04,564
<i>I was scared, and it was just an excuse</i>

813
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:08,860
<i>to avoid the moment</i>
<i>I'd have to face you as 406.</i>

814
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,785
<i>However,</i>

815
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:21,039
<i>I won't run away anymore.</i>

816
00:58:22,415 --> 00:58:24,918
<i>I won't let you struggle alone any longer.</i>

817
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,431
Where…

818
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:23,351
are you right now?

819
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,479
<i>I have a place where I want to meet you.</i>

820
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,064
<i>Come there.</i>

821
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:54,966
<i>Are you here?</i>

822
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:55,967
Yeah.

823
00:59:58,803 --> 01:00:00,513
Why here, though?

824
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,640
<i>Have you been here before?</i>

825
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,351
On the day this park first opened…

826
01:00:14,986 --> 01:00:16,946
<i>After that, the word "amusement park"</i>

827
01:00:17,530 --> 01:00:19,449
became forbidden in our house.

828
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:21,534
<i>Come to the carousel.</i>

829
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,369
<i>Let's meet there.</i>

830
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:40,887
Would you like to enter?

831
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:02,116
In-a, there are so many horses.

832
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,119
Look there!

833
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:45,868
I don't see you.

834
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:47,620
Where are you?

835
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,497
<i>I'm by the ice cream stand.</i>

836
01:02:34,417 --> 01:02:35,668
Are you coming?

837
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:39,464
I'm waiting for you.

838
01:02:39,547 --> 01:02:41,924
<i>What do you see in front of you?</i>

839
01:02:43,342 --> 01:02:44,677
In front of me?

840
01:02:56,189 --> 01:02:57,398
I came up.

841
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,779
But there's no one here.

842
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,447
<i>Just wait.</i>

843
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,456
What are you doing?

844
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:15,666
<i>I'm getting you to relax.</i>

845
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:19,504
<i>I've been waiting for the moment</i>
<i>to meet you too.</i>

846
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,965
<i>I don't want to see you looking all stiff.</i>

847
01:03:23,716 --> 01:03:24,926
Don't get your hopes up.

848
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:28,554
You'll probably wish
you never saw me at all.

849
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,056
<i>I guess you're not confident.</i>

850
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,267
Are you confident
you won't be surprised to see me?

851
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:34,894
I don't think so.

852
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,979
You'll be shocked…

853
01:03:38,356 --> 01:03:39,857
and disappointed.

854
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,068
So you might

855
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:44,570
end up feeling lonely.

856
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:45,822
<i>Are you</i>

857
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,366
<i>worried about me right now?</i>

858
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:52,411
No.

859
01:03:55,790 --> 01:03:57,166
I'm worried about myself.

860
01:03:58,084 --> 01:03:59,752
<i>I'm worried about seeing…</i>

861
01:04:01,337 --> 01:04:02,255
<i>you like that.</i>

862
01:04:03,381 --> 01:04:04,298
<i>I swear,</i>

863
01:04:05,508 --> 01:04:06,759
<i>you don't listen.</i>

864
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,220
<i>I'm sure I told you.</i>

865
01:04:09,971 --> 01:04:13,558
<i>Underestimating yourself is a bad habit.</i>

866
01:04:17,895 --> 01:04:18,729
How should I…

867
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,483
fix that for you, Hong Hee-joo?

868
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:47,717
Thank you…

869
01:04:52,221 --> 01:04:54,223
for all your hard work, 406.

870
01:04:54,307 --> 01:04:55,141
You…

871
01:04:57,602 --> 01:04:58,936
knew everything?

872
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,898
Since when? No…

873
01:05:03,941 --> 01:05:06,110
If you knew, why didn't you…

874
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,154
Why didn't I what?

875
01:05:09,864 --> 01:05:11,365
Why didn't you hate me?

876
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:14,160
Tell me…

877
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:18,706
Hong Hee-joo.

878
01:05:21,125 --> 01:05:23,002
Tell me how to hate you.

879
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:34,847
Tell me how to not love you.

880
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,635

881
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:39,305
<i>It's just hard to believe.</i>

882
01:07:39,388 --> 01:07:42,975

01:07:43,684 --> 01:07:46,771
<i>Could you do the same</i>

884
01:07:47,521 --> 01:07:49,023
<i>I'm going to take it all.</i>

885
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:51,150
<i>What grudge does he have against you?</i>

886
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:53,277
What are you doing?

887
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,321
Do you already know who the culprit is?

888
01:07:55,821 --> 01:07:58,574
What bothers me isn't the case, it's you.

889
01:07:58,657 --> 01:08:00,117
Don't hide anything from me.

890
01:08:00,951 --> 01:08:02,119
Show me everything.

891
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,749
<i>This kind of happiness</i>

892
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:09,335
