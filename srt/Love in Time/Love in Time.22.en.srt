You rejected me and told me you wanted to rely on yourself.

He understands my thoughts better, but what about you?

- Yes.

165
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,740
Miss Han.

166
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,120
President Kang, do you want to resolve this crisis?

167
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,125
As one of the project partners, I need to stand up now.

168
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,319
But it is not a small number.

169
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:32,160
Can you get the money?

170
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,160
I will try my best.

171
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,160
What an affectionate man.

172
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:43,575
But it is early.

173
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:47,660
Early?

174
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:50,860
President Kang, you should know that

175
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:55,075
people won't cherish things that come easily.

176
00:14:55,075 --> 00:14:57,659
If you choose to help her now,

177
00:14:57,659 --> 00:15:00,399
you will get nothing.

178
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,639
She won't take you seriously.

179
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,074
It would be better if you show up (with funds)

180
00:15:04,074 --> 00:15:08,536
when Su Jian'an is the most desperate and helpless.

181
00:15:08,536 --> 00:15:11,359
You should be her savior.

182
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:17,050
At that point, she will go to you.

183
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:24,260
Do you want to be the rebound guy for the rest of your life?

184
00:15:29,479 --> 00:15:32,899
Lu Bo Yan quit the project.

185
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,179
Su Jian'an has moved out of the Lu home.

186
00:15:36,179 --> 00:15:40,179
No one can hinder your creation anymore.

187
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:44,220
What a good opportunity.

188
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:54,659
I should return to Bo Yan.

189
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:15,939
President Lu, you are mistaken.

190
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:17,839
Shut up!

191
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,060
Come with me.

192
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,760
Hey!

193
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,620
Bo Yan, I know I was wrong.

194
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,299
Give me another chance, okay?

195
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:59,939
Kang Rui Cheng doesn't want to work with me. He only wants Su Jian'an.

196
00:16:59,939 --> 00:17:01,779
Now, he has succeeded.

197
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:03,419
I am an eyesore to Su Jian'an,

198
00:17:03,419 --> 00:17:06,700
and they nitpick over everything I do.

199
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:10,159
They took me out of the film.

200
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:14,859
I want to come back to Lu's Media. Can I?

201
00:17:18,239 --> 00:17:20,640
Why come back to Lu's Media?

202
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:25,375
My net worth is higher than it was before.

203
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:28,580
You know about "When Time Stops."

204
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,535
After that, many well-known directors asked for a cooperation.

205
00:17:31,535 --> 00:17:34,900
I have many endorsements from luxury brands.

206
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:39,679
You will benefit from our cooperation.

207
00:17:41,939 --> 00:17:43,919
You know the process.

208
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,320
Go sign the contract with Yue Chuan.

209
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,740
Thank you, Bo Yan.

210
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:35,879
President Kang, does our crew have no hope now?

211
00:18:35,879 --> 00:18:40,379
Not at all. I will fix every problem.

212
00:18:40,379 --> 00:18:43,660
Even if I have to go all out and offend President Lu.

213
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:46,850
Because it is your dream.

214
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:50,080
Why are you doing this for me?

215
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,250
Because someone did this for me, too.

216
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:57,358
I met a girl three years ago.

217
00:18:57,358 --> 00:19:00,080
We hadn't known each other before that.

218
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,280
The girl helped me to get back an important contract.

219
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,580
At that time, I had just started my company.

220
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,399
That contract was very important to me.

221
00:19:12,219 --> 00:19:14,699
I didn't know her name.

222
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:18,879
I didn't even know what she looked like

223
00:19:18,879 --> 00:19:23,680
because, that day, she was wearing a mask.

224
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,040
Later, I found out

225
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:32,110
that her name was Su Jian'an.

226
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,960
Stop!

227
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,040
- Are you okay?
- I am fine.

228
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,319
You are bleeding.

229
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:53,819
Was it really me?

230
00:19:53,819 --> 00:19:57,700
Maybe you had not noticed this,

231
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,760
but that moment has been buried in my heart.

232
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,930
President Kang, if you are doing it just because of that,

233
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:09,860
there is no need for you to take such a big risk.

234
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,879
It is because I love you.

235
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:18,000
Can I, Jian'an?

236
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:23,500
After we are together, let me help you with your dream.

237
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,560
I'm sorry, President Kang.

238
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,180
I cannot.

239
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:39,440
Do you... still love Lu Bo Yan?

240
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,275
I just don't want to protect the project by cheating you.

241
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:53,359
Thank you, President Kang,

242
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,040
but I really can't promise you anything.

243
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,299
It's not too late to regret it now.

244
00:21:28,950 --> 00:21:31,700
I never regret.

245
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:36,180
I was sure since the first time I saw you, that you would be

246
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:44,360
Lu Bo Yan's wife.

247
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:52,119
No matter what you become, I'll be with you forever, Mrs. Lu.

248
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,820
♫ Sharing the wounds ♫

249
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:07,800
♫ Of our memories with each other ♫

250
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,690
♫ My failure is only because I know how to run away impulsively ♫

251
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:22,350
♫ What I shouldn't have done is a result of not handling it with calmness ♫

252
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:26,700
♫ My regret is accidentally losing the color ♫

253
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:33,120
♫ Of the love you gave me ♫

254
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,000
Dad!

255
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:45,640
♫ What should I do in order to reverse the situation, staging a non-separation? ♫

256
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:49,340
All right. Don't cry.

257
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:52,960
You have me.

258
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:55,540
It is okay.

259
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,500
Don't cry.

260
00:22:59,599 --> 00:23:01,660
You have me.

261
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,119
I'm sorry.

262
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,000
You've been so worried about me.

263
00:23:23,939 --> 00:23:25,740
Don't cry.

264
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,800
If you had inherited my business,

265
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,520
you wouldn't have become like this.

266
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,579
Did I do this wrong?

267
00:23:41,579 --> 00:23:45,720
Cheer up. Come home with me.

268
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,700
I don't want to give up, though.

269
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:51,980
- Do you want to persist?
- Yes.

270
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,980
My good daughter,

271
00:23:56,980 --> 00:24:01,359
you're so stubborn just like me.

272
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:08,759
Dad, I really don't know what to do now, though.

273
00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:11,580
I fought with Bo Yan.

274
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:16,250
Xiao Xi and Shao Kai left.

275
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:22,000
Now, the crew will leave.

276
00:24:23,979 --> 00:24:28,559
I've been in a similar situation before.

277
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,560
Back then, I was very paranoid.

278
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,959
I was so egotistical,

279
00:24:35,959 --> 00:24:40,499
and I often quarreled with your mom.

280
00:24:40,499 --> 00:24:43,819
I had many disputes with my financial partners.

281
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:47,020
I thought they didn't understand me.

282
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:49,460
I wanted to prove myself fully.

283
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:54,025
Gradually, I was alienated from them.

284
00:24:54,025 --> 00:24:56,900
Even if I succeeded,

285
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,870
I would have no one to talk to.

286
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:03,790
There was no one who talked to me heartily.

287
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:09,200
Later, I came to realize that those who didn't care about me just left.

288
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:14,900
But those who cared about me would feel very sad after leaving.

289
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:21,020
Jian'an, people will eventually return to their family.

290
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:26,579
You have to find a balance between your career, family, and friendships.

291
00:25:26,579 --> 00:25:29,879
Then your career will be more meaningful.

292
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,940
I get it now.

293
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,040
Thank you, Dad.

294
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:42,279
I didn't understand you,

295
00:25:42,279 --> 00:25:44,800
and I often upset you.

296
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,800
I'm sorry.

297
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,419
No one is perfect.

298
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:50,700
I have some faults, too.

299
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,580
I am very happy to see your achievements today.

300
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:00,059
I am not here to ask you to come home and inherit my business.

301
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,919
I'm here to give you some help.

302
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,240
It is just a film.

303
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,459
I will invest the money,

304
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,398
but you don't get anything for free.

305
00:26:15,398 --> 00:26:21,025
If you agree to cooperate with me, I have some conditions.

306
00:26:21,025 --> 00:26:22,558
What conditions?

307
00:26:22,558 --> 00:26:26,580
You have to put Su's Beauty lingerie advertisements in your film,

308
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,099
no fewer than five times.

309
00:26:29,099 --> 00:26:33,200
If you accept this, we can work together.

310
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:37,000
Thank you, Dad.

311
00:26:38,659 --> 00:26:42,480
Your dad will always protect you.

312
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,850
I will always back you up.

313
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,579
- Do you remember?
- Yes.

314
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:02,038
Xiao Xi, Shao Kai. I know you two are inside.

315
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:04,880
Please open the door.

316
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,340
Stop. Come back.

317
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:12,559
Xiao Xi, we should open the door.

318
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:16,219
Give Jian'an a chance to explain.

319
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:17,919
No.

320
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:27,800
Xiao Xi, please listen to my explanation.

321
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,539
It's really not what you think.

322
00:27:30,539 --> 00:27:32,940
Open the door!

323
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,180
Don't be upset.

324
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,519
Xiao Xi, since you won't open the door,

325
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:44,939
I will go now.

326
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,260
Is she leaving so soon?

327
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,080
She wasn't sincere at all.

328
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,358
She wants to explain, but where is the sincerity?

329
00:28:00,358 --> 00:28:02,839
What a rotten sister!

330
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,760
Xiao Xi.

331
00:28:07,819 --> 00:28:09,819
Sister Xi.

332
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:15,239
You have been sisters (friends) for so many years.

333
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:19,580
You've become like this over a little misunderstanding. Is it worth it?

334
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,039
Jiang Shao Kai, whose side are you on?

335
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,719
Do you know how ridiculous she is?

336
00:28:24,879 --> 00:28:26,780
Actually, I really don't think—

337
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:29,780
If you say another word, you must leave immediately!

338
00:28:31,839 --> 00:28:35,859
Yes! You are right.

339
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:38,318
Su Jian'an is so ridiculous!

340
00:28:38,318 --> 00:28:42,158
Look, you are so beautiful, charming, (and) sexy.

341
00:28:42,158 --> 00:28:43,599
What does Su Jian'an have?

342
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,479
She has nothing good going for her besides writing.

343
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:50,420
I will criticize... criticize her!

344
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,960
Why are you so annoying?

345
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:56,118
Don't get me involved.

346
00:28:56,118 --> 00:28:59,799
It's none of my business. It's none of my business, right?

347
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:04,538
If you excuse me, do whatever you like.

348
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:07,679
Why did you stop?

349
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,519
Xiao Xi, I have the key.

350
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,820
Xiao Xi, let me explain.

351
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,239
It's really not what you think.

352
00:29:28,459 --> 00:29:34,439
Xiao Xi, I am here to apologize to you.

353
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,775
I know I haven't been in a good state for a while.

354
00:29:37,775 --> 00:29:41,579
What I said about you that day was not my intention.

355
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:46,319
You know me very well.

356
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,199
Are you finished? If so, you can go now.

357
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,300
I haven't finished yet.

358
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,140
Do you remember

359
00:30:11,179 --> 00:30:17,425
when I started writing novels, and you two helped me?

360
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:23,730
When I had a difficult time, you stayed by my side,

361
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:28,000
helped me, and encouraged me.

362
00:30:30,375 --> 00:30:36,820
I only have this job today because you kept me company.

363
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:45,100
I can never... forget this in my heart.

364
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:53,080
Xiao Xi, you are my best friend.

365
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:14,540
Xiao Xi, I truly wanted to keep the role of the leading actress' girlfriend for you.

366
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,999
In my heart, you are the most suitable person for this role.

367
00:31:18,999 --> 00:31:21,519
When I first created this work,

368
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,579
you were part of the inspiration for my novel.

369
00:31:23,579 --> 00:31:30,027
I sincerely hope we can have our own novel.

370
00:31:30,027 --> 00:31:31,840
How about it?

371
00:31:35,725 --> 00:31:40,600
I never actually cared about the leading actress role.

372
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:45,540
Do you know what I really cared about?

373
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:48,299
Our friendship.

374
00:31:50,879 --> 00:31:55,080
Xiao Xi, do you forgive me?

375
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:59,598
How can I not forgive you? You know me so well.

376
00:31:59,598 --> 00:32:04,980
Xiao Xi, you will always be the best Xiao Xi in my heart.

377
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:19,520
This is my father, Mr. Su Hong Yuan.

378
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,158
Now, we have fixed the funding problem,

379
00:32:23,158 --> 00:32:26,379
and we can proceed according to the original plan.

380
00:32:27,499 --> 00:32:30,868
Thank you, Mr. Su, for solving the funding issue for us.

381
00:32:30,868 --> 00:32:32,479
It is my daughter's project.

382
00:32:32,479 --> 00:32:34,820
There's no need to thank me.

383
00:32:37,575 --> 00:32:42,839
Luo Xiao Xi will be the supporting actress.

384
00:32:42,839 --> 00:32:47,540
Jiang Shao Kai will still be in charge of the commercials.

385
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,299
It is great to see that you've come back.

386
00:32:49,299 --> 00:32:52,374
We are still preparing for the shooting.

387
00:32:52,374 --> 00:32:55,519
I hope all of you can quickly prepare.

388
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,679
I didn't expect Su Hong Yuan to come.

389
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:12,225
Jian'an is very impressive.

390
00:33:12,225 --> 00:33:16,559
President Kang, I believe you're aware that

391
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,298
Su Jian'an and Lu Bo Yan are living apart.

392
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:23,825
However, she still has Lu Bo Yan in her heart.

393
00:33:23,825 --> 00:33:26,499
Unless...

394
00:33:26,499 --> 00:33:28,840
Unless what?

395
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:35,675
Unless you fuel their broken marriage

396
00:33:35,675 --> 00:33:41,986
to remove Lu Bo Yan from Su Jian'an's heart completely.

397
00:33:41,986 --> 00:33:44,310
You know what I mean.

398
00:33:45,099 --> 00:33:48,419
Don't you want to win Su Jian'an?
