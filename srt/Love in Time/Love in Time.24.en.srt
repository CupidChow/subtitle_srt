[Episode 24]

13
00:01:10,825 --> 00:01:14,500
Look at you two, married couples all eventually kiss and make up.

14
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:19,538
You lived apart and nearly divorced because of such trifles.

15
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,339
How ridiculous.

16
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,500
Yes. I had insomnia for so many nights because of you.

17
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,759
Now everything is good. You've made up so I can relax now.

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,160
I am sorry for making you worry, Mom and Dad.

19
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,979
Dad, Mom. Jian'an and I know we were wrong.

20
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:39,080
We're planning to hold our wedding again.

21
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,420
That's right. You must hold a grand one!

22
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:45,459
We will hold the largest wedding of the century in this city!

23
00:01:45,459 --> 00:01:50,700
Let the world know you are very happy together.

24
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,379
But her movie hasn't finished filming yet.

25
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:56,859
We are very busy so we're planning to hold it later.

26
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:59,879
Okay. It's up to you.

27
00:01:59,879 --> 00:02:01,725
It's up to you.

[Three months later]

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,840
- Hello.
- Hello, Jian'an.

30
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,719
Big Radish.

31
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:20,419
How are you doing in the film crew? Do you miss me?

32
00:02:20,419 --> 00:02:23,299
Of course, I miss you! I miss you every minute.

33
00:02:23,299 --> 00:02:26,559
Then why won't you come back earlier?

34
00:02:26,559 --> 00:02:29,459
When was the last time we saw each other?

35
00:02:29,459 --> 00:02:31,338
I am still not done here.

36
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:33,179
I'll head home right after the movie wraps up filming.

37
00:02:33,179 --> 00:02:34,880
I love you.

38
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,339
I love you, too.

39
00:02:37,339 --> 00:02:40,879
By the way, Jian'an, I sent you some pictures of wedding dresses.

40
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,618
You should choose one when you have the time.

41
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:45,650
You even had time to choose wedding dresses?

42
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:50,324
I've finished a whole month of work in advance. All you have to do is come back.

43
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:53,318
Fine. Be good and wait for me at home.

44
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:56,500
- I'm hanging up now.
- Bye bye.

45
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:09,019
President Lu, this is what you asked for.

46
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:18,879
No! I can't wait anymore.

47
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,160
Prepare the car. Let's go to the film set.

48
00:03:21,839 --> 00:03:23,499
President Lu!

49
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,859
President Lu, you are so impatient.

50
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:34,320
Sister-in-law will be back in a few days.

51
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,060
You know nothing.

52
00:03:54,379 --> 00:03:55,779
President Lu!

53
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:58,100
President Lu, are you okay?

54
00:04:06,059 --> 00:04:07,559
Okay, cut!

55
00:04:07,559 --> 00:04:11,300
Everyone, that's a wrap!

56
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,899
Thank you, everyone! Thank you!

57
00:04:16,025 --> 00:04:17,339
- Thank you!
- Director, thank you for all your hard work!

58
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,398
- Thank you, everyone.
- Congratulations!

59
00:04:19,398 --> 00:04:22,060
Director Guo, Shao Kai, I won't go to the wrap party.

60
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,739
No! How could you not go to the wrap party?

61
00:04:24,739 --> 00:04:27,024
- I need to go home and see Bo Yan.
- Okay.

62
00:04:27,024 --> 00:04:29,699
I'll leave the post-production work to you, Director Guo.

63
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:32,559
- Let's keep in touch.
- Yes.

64
00:04:32,559 --> 00:04:35,240
- I'm leaving now.
- Go ahead.

65
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,919
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

66
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,580
- I'm going.
- Okay, bye bye.

67
00:04:56,319 --> 00:04:58,460
Uncle Xu, I'm back.

68
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,860
Mrs. Lu, you're back.

69
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,440
Where is Bo Yan?

70
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,820
- President Lu...
- What's wrong?

71
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:06,359
He hit his head, and now he has amnesia.

72
00:05:06,359 --> 00:05:09,799
It seems he can't remember what has happened in the past few months.

73
00:05:09,799 --> 00:05:14,450
What kind of cheap cliché is this?

74
00:05:17,739 --> 00:05:19,920
What happened to you? Did you hit your head?

75
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,710
Let me see.

76
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,639
Why are you back so late?

77
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:33,099
You are part of my Lu family now. You need to follow my family's rules.

78
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:36,760
This sounds familiar.

79
00:05:38,979 --> 00:05:41,058
Are you playing the amnesia game?

80
00:05:41,058 --> 00:05:43,539
Bring it on.

81
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,978
It says in our contract, you're not allowed to get involved with other people.

82
00:05:47,978 --> 00:05:52,025
Don't let what happened yesterday happen again.

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,520
Yesterday?

84
00:05:56,979 --> 00:05:58,900
I was working yesterday.

85
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,599
Working?

86
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:03,839
Is your job to drink and chat at a bar with the opposite sex?

87
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:07,119
If I hadn't arrived in time yesterday, do you know what the consequences would have been?

88
00:06:07,119 --> 00:06:08,819
A bar?

89
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:10,518
That's the story in Episode Three.

90
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:12,280
He is quite the actor.

91
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,379
Let's see how long you can keep it up.

92
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,098
I remember now.

93
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:20,778
President Lu, we signed a contract.

94
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:22,338
We are not to interfere with each other's private lives.

95
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:25,659
You have your rules, I have my boundaries!

96
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:18,338
This guy did quite a lot.

97
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:20,978
You entered my room without my permission.

98
00:07:20,978 --> 00:07:22,579
Do you have any manners?

99
00:07:22,579 --> 00:07:25,639
Lu Bo Yan, can't you make some noise when you walk in?

100
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:28,379
So you like my bed that much, do you?

101
00:07:28,379 --> 00:07:30,318
Why did you move my things?

102
00:07:30,318 --> 00:07:32,579
How long are you going to keep up this act?

103
00:07:32,579 --> 00:07:34,759
I don't understand what you are talking about.

104
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:37,019
I need to sleep now.

105
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,459
Are you still not leaving?

106
00:07:42,459 --> 00:07:45,459
Okay. You asked for this!

107
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,420
That wretched Lu Bo Yan.

108
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,799
Did President Lu really lose his memory?

109
00:08:00,799 --> 00:08:02,200
What should we do?

110
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,778
Don't panic!

111
00:08:03,778 --> 00:08:06,338
According to the tone of this drama and President Lu's persona,

112
00:08:06,338 --> 00:08:08,799
I don't think he would lose his memory.

113
00:08:08,799 --> 00:08:12,219
This must be the screenwriter's trap.

114
00:08:13,079 --> 00:08:15,700
Okay, let's test him.

115
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:19,518
Okay. I'll play this game with you.

116
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,459
Let me think about the plot.

117
00:08:29,459 --> 00:08:31,919
What was I doing back then?

118
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,358
Oh, right! I was writing my novel.

119
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,659
"No! Don't kill me!"

120
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,179
"It's too late now. Go to h*ll!"

121
00:08:47,179 --> 00:08:50,319
"I can't believe you're a detective!"

122
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,639
He took the bait.

123
00:08:54,419 --> 00:08:56,978
- What time is it?
- It's only ten o'clock.

124
00:08:56,978 --> 00:08:58,820
Are you going to sleep or not?

125
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:01,639
Sleep if you want. I need to write my novel.

126
00:09:01,639 --> 00:09:03,578
I can only find inspiration at night.

127
00:09:03,578 --> 00:09:06,000
I am busy trying to make my deadline.

128
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,258
Can you shut up so I can sleep in peace?

129
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:12,818
I'm putting myself in my characters' shoes right now. What's wrong with that?

130
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,879
Go to sleep or put this on. Choose one.

131
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:22,538
He even added more to the story and prepared props.

132
00:09:22,538 --> 00:09:24,298
I choose neither.

133
00:09:24,298 --> 00:09:27,999
Unless... you hug me, then I can sleep.

134
00:09:27,999 --> 00:09:29,380
Su Jian'an, you—

135
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,120
I have no time for sleep.

136
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,340
I need to submit my manuscript tomorrow.

137
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:37,059
What are you doing?

138
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,299
- Let go.
- Oh my.

139
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:49,600
My hands are glued together.

140
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,178
It will be a long night. How about we sleep together?

141
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,979
Lady! We signed a contract!

142
00:09:59,979 --> 00:10:03,400
Brother Bo Yan, don't go.

143
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:09,239
You're playing with me, are you? Let's see how long you can hold back.

144
00:10:09,239 --> 00:10:11,140
You stinky radish!

145
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:38,319
Why are you in my bed?

146
00:10:38,319 --> 00:10:39,874
What's the matter?

147
00:10:39,874 --> 00:10:42,675
We are married. What's wrong with sleeping together?

148
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:45,300
We should make this act look real.

149
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,700
According to the contract, we can't have any physical contact!

150
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,640
We are having physical contact now.

151
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,860
What are you going to do?

152
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,778
I'm warning you. Don't—

153
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,720
Don't what?

154
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:06,619
Don't lose control of yourself?

155
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,579
I—

156
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:18,059
Why are you taking a shower in my room?

157
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,459
Then why did you sleep in my bed?

158
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:28,739
Do I look good?

159
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,199
You do.

160
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,559
How about I strip myself for you to look at?

161
00:11:34,559 --> 00:11:36,779
Gosh.

162
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,819
Of course, I'd like that.

163
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,780
What kind of woman are you?

164
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,898
Take it off. Hurry up, I'm waiting for it.

165
00:11:44,898 --> 00:11:48,339
- Or should I strip first?
- Hey! Don't come closer.

166
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:52,999
Why are you so shy? We've already been married for so long. Don't be shy.

167
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,590
Brother Bo Yan, don't go!

168
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:58,930
[Serious Coffee]

169
00:11:59,939 --> 00:12:02,119
Did President Lu really run away in panic?

170
00:12:02,119 --> 00:12:05,225
I'll never be able to imagine President Lu running away like that.

171
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,401
It is quite fun, but it has been so many days already. I don't know what he is thinking.

172
00:12:09,401 --> 00:12:11,759
It's so romantic.

173
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:13,520
Jiang Shao Kai, can't you learn from him?

174
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:15,339
What?

175
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,058
Should I get amnesia

176
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:22,240
and forget all about you?

177
00:12:26,299 --> 00:12:27,278
How dare you!

178
00:12:27,278 --> 00:12:29,578
Help me figure this out.

179
00:12:29,578 --> 00:12:32,000
What is he playing at?

180
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,724
What else could it be? It must be because you were busy with the film these past months and ignored him.

181
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:38,515
He wants attention.

182
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:42,200
The way I see it, no matter what he is trying to do,

183
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,940
you should just play along with him till the end!

184
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:46,779
Reminisce the process of how you two met and fell in love.

185
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:49,819
- So romantic.
- But it has been so many days.

186
00:12:49,819 --> 00:12:53,799
If he is acting, it's impossible he wouldn't slip up at all.

187
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:56,199
He didn't lose his memory for real, did he?

188
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:59,298
Do you think you're in a soap opera or something? He wouldn't lose his memory so easily.

189
00:12:59,298 --> 00:13:00,799
I don't think so, either.

190
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:03,858
He used to be the one to tease me. Now I am teasing him.

191
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,478
He should play along with me.

192
00:13:05,478 --> 00:13:09,675
Judging from my experience, it's impossible he could persist with this for too long.

193
00:13:14,775 --> 00:13:17,599
How about this? According to President Lu's timeline,

194
00:13:17,599 --> 00:13:20,119
you just moved into the Lu family.

195
00:13:20,119 --> 00:13:23,198
Next, he'll misunderstand us when we talk about your script.

196
00:13:23,198 --> 00:13:26,118
Let's try. Let's see if he really lost his memory.

197
00:13:26,118 --> 00:13:28,020
How?

198
00:13:31,699 --> 00:13:33,620
Why are you looking at me? Don't drag me into this!

199
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,719
What if President Lu retaliates against me after this?

200
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:37,220
I won't do it.

201
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,119
Raise your hand if you agree. It's two to one.

202
00:13:39,119 --> 00:13:41,060
The minority obeys the majority.

203
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,980
Jiang Shao Kai, sit over there.

204
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:46,538
You are finally useful today! Sit down.

205
00:13:46,538 --> 00:13:48,939
You two pretend to discuss the script. Be intimate.

206
00:13:48,939 --> 00:13:50,699
- I'll take pictures of you.
- I don't want to do this. Why are you always like this?

207
00:13:50,699 --> 00:13:52,679
One, two, three!

208
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:55,879
Perfect.

209
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,880
This is unbelievable.

210
00:14:00,419 --> 00:14:02,679
I'll post it on my WeChat moments.
[A boy and girl paired together, filled with inspiration!]

211
00:14:03,419 --> 00:14:06,999
Wait a second. You didn't edit the photo yet!

212
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:09,679
Did you really post it?
[One notification]

213

Lu Bo Yan gave it a thumbs-up right away.

214
00:14:14,699 --> 00:14:17,839
It seems like things are really going just as before.

215
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,818
What do we do next?

216
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,359
We...

217
00:14:42,020 --> 00:14:44,439
Jian'an, come home with me.

218
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:46,020
I don't want to leave with you.

219
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,720
Can't you see I'm busy with my friends?

220
00:14:50,539 --> 00:14:52,499
Bro!

221
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,880
You are...

222
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:03,600
A good friend of Su Jian'an, I'm Jiang Shao Kai.

223
00:15:08,059 --> 00:15:09,698
Jian'an said she doesn't want to leave with you.

224
00:15:09,698 --> 00:15:12,200
Please don't force her.

225
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,838
What I do with my wife

226
00:15:14,838 --> 00:15:16,739
is none of your business.

227
00:15:16,739 --> 00:15:18,379
Your wife?

228
00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:21,079
Jian'an, when did you get married?

229
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:23,000
Yes, when did you get married?

230
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,074
Why didn't I know?

231
00:15:25,074 --> 00:15:27,640
Weren't you my bridesmaid when I got married?

232
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,079
Oh, that's right. How could I forget I was your bridesmaid?

233
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:32,958
Why didn't you tell me?

234
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:36,659
Jian'an, why did you choose him?

235
00:15:36,659 --> 00:15:39,678
Say it! Did he force you to marry him?

236
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:42,059
It's Jiang Shao Kai, right?

237
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:45,459
Mind your language.

238
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:48,058
Lu Bo Yan, I'm warning you.

239
00:15:48,058 --> 00:15:50,519
Su Jian'an is my best friend.

240
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:54,314
If you bully her, I will...

241
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,160
What will you do?

242
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,560
I...

243
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,359
I will...

244
00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:06,039
Come home.

245
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,839
I don't want to go with you. Let go!

246
00:16:08,839 --> 00:16:10,499
Lu Bo Yan! Don't go!

247
00:16:10,499 --> 00:16:11,779
- I am not done talking with you!
- That's enough. The act is over.

248
00:16:11,779 --> 00:16:15,078
Do you think I can't defeat you? Come back—

249
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,379
Well done.

250
00:16:37,939 --> 00:16:39,839
What is your relationship with Jiang Shao Kai?

251
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:42,980
It's whatever you think it is.

252
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,959
You must keep your distance from him in the future.

253
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:48,240
You aren't jealous, are you, Mr. Lu?

254
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:58,680
You should have some self-awareness.

255
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,600
I can keep my distance from him,

256
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,979
but that depends on your performance.

257
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:06,318
I know you are pretending.

258
00:17:06,318 --> 00:17:09,300
Let me kiss you. Then I'll promise you.

259
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,780
Hey!

260
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:15,959
How did you become so frivolous after all these years?

261
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:19,759
I'm so disappointed.

262
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:25,600
What the heck is going on?

263
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,110
[Outpatient]

264
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:33,219
- What! Does he really have amnesia?
- Wow.

265
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:35,920
It's very serious.

266
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,679
You know nothing.

267
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,560
A few days ago, President Lu hit his head.

268
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:43,019
Luckily, he was treated quickly so he is fine.

269
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:47,158
However, because of the trauma to his head, he has intermittent memory loss.

270
00:17:47,158 --> 00:17:49,638
People experience different types of amnesia,

271
00:17:49,638 --> 00:17:51,498
and from my current observation,

272
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:54,558
President Lu has lost his memory of the recent months.

273
00:17:54,558 --> 00:17:58,878
Oh, my goodness! This plot is so dramatic.

274
00:17:58,878 --> 00:18:02,379
Darn it. I only just managed to establish a friendship with President Lu.

275
00:18:02,379 --> 00:18:05,119
It's gone just like that now.

276
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:07,918
It's okay, Jian'an.

277
00:18:07,918 --> 00:18:11,018
I remember a movie called "100 First Dates."

278
00:18:11,018 --> 00:18:12,978
You can pursue President Lu then.

279
00:18:12,978 --> 00:18:16,098
Make him fall in love with you again. We will continue to help you!

280
00:18:16,098 --> 00:18:17,759
What are you talking about?

281
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:22,139
I've already ruined my character the past few days!

282
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:30,460
Mom, Bo Yan hasn't come home for days!

283
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:34,499
I thought you could awaken his memory when you came back.

284
00:18:34,499 --> 00:18:36,940
I'm sorry you have to put up with this, Jian'an.

285
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,280
Mom, is there any other way?

286
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:44,039
I already took him to see an expert, but it was in vain.

287
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,840
It's up to him.

288
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:51,699
Jian'an, no matter what, we are still a family.

289
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,100
President Lu, Yun Yun has the most potential of the newcomers.

290
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,818
She has also published a collection of poems. She is very talented.

291
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,300
President Lu.

292
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,880
Thank you.

293
00:19:21,775 --> 00:19:24,999
Why do you want to sign a contract with Lu's Media?

294
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:28,674
Because Lu's Media has the most professional management team in the country.

295
00:19:28,674 --> 00:19:30,759
I can improve myself faster here,

296
00:19:30,759 --> 00:19:33,439
and I can realize my dream.

297
00:19:33,439 --> 00:19:37,919
President Lu, you are also very handsome.

298
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:43,919
Welcome aboard.

299
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,598
Thank you, President Lu! Please take good care of me.

300
00:19:46,598 --> 00:19:49,340
I will work hard.

301
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,240
Bo Yan.

302
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,040
I heard you've been so busy that you barely have time to eat.

303
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,740
Thus, I brought your lunch.

304
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,580
Yun Yun, come with me.

305
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:59,459
We'll talk about the contract.

306
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:01,099
Okay.

307
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,420
Why did you come here all of a sudden?

308
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:14,860
Uncle Xu told me that your stomach has been hurting again lately.

309
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:17,018
You need to eat your meals on time. Here.

310
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:19,119
Have some porridge.

311
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:21,059
Okay, I'll pay more attention to that.

312
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,725
But it was very inappropriate of you to barge in on our meeting just now.

313
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,799
I won't do it again.

314
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,840
Bo Yan, come home for dinner tonight.

315
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:37,720
I invited Mom over for dinner.

316
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,800
Got it.

317
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:43,320
I'll wait for you at home.

318
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,040
All right.

319
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,818
Sister-in-law, how did it go?

320
00:21:05,818 --> 00:21:08,041
Does President Lu remember anything?

321
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:11,159
I invited him home for dinner. Remember to remind him.

322
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:14,060
Okay, I will rush him home.

323
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,499

324
00:22:15,499 --> 00:22:16,875

The second child's surname will be Su.

445
00:33:28,978 --> 00:33:30,799
The third one's surname doesn't matter.

446
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,180
If they have a fourth child,

447
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:35,460
it will depend on whether it's a boy or a girl.

You don't have a say.

Nowadays, it's already great if young people have even one child.

Exactly.

00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:13,325
This contract needs to have an expiration date, right?

Right!
