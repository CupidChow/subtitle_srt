13
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,619
- President!
- Are you causing trouble?

14
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,159
- President, I...
- Go, go!

15
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:15,559
You are so ridiculous.

16
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:21,180
Bo Yan, are you okay?

17
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,820
I'm okay.

18
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,799
I will leave you to talk. See you.

19
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:30,910
President Lu, Miss Han. Sorry for disturbing you.

20
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:34,240
President Lu, per your request,

21
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,540
I have already abandoned male-oriented novels.

22
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,519
We can still talk about the valuation.

23
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:42,799
So please don't avoid me.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,660
I have been obsessed with "Lin Nan's Murder" lately,

25
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:49,279
and I've lost track of time. I'm sorry.

26
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,740
No. I thought...

27
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,740
By the way, that author is one of your male-oriented authors, right?

28
00:01:57,399 --> 00:01:59,939
She is still working for you, right?

29
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:02,759
Yes, yes, yes.

30
00:02:02,759 --> 00:02:05,640
I read the latest chapter and the readers' comments.

31
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,959
I think a male and female-oriented author like her

32
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:10,240
has a lot of potential.

33
00:02:11,119 --> 00:02:14,025
If she still works for you,

34
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:19,400
I'm willing to invest in you at your valuation price.

35
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,400
What!

36
00:02:22,399 --> 00:02:25,399
That's not Bo Yan's style.

37
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,025
You are not right for this industry.

Are you giving up so easily?

40
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:24,558
Lu Bo Yan, President Du wants to terminate the contract with me.

41

It's over for me.

42
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,600
Are you giving up on yourself just because you got rejected once?

43
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,380
That's not the right thing to do, is it?

44
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,059
They are right.

45
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,260
I've been writing for so many years, but I still haven't succeeded.

46
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,910
It seems...

47
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:50,950
I'm really not suited to write novels.

48
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,300
They're wrong. I think you are suited for it.

49
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:06,640
Do you know?

50
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,460
Every time I watch you write,

51
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,880
I always feel that your eyes are glowing.

52
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,160
What does that prove?

53
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,979
It proves that you like it very much.

54
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,400
You also enjoy writing a lot.

55
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,620
I can feel the warmth in your writing.

56
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,720
Maybe it's what you said.

57
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,030
It's your way of creating, by putting yourself in your characters' shoes.

58
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,700
Okay, here comes the main point.

59
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:39,619
Since you like it, why do you care about others' opinions?

60
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,319
I still remember when I first took over the company,

61
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,239
no one trusted me.

62
00:04:46,239 --> 00:04:48,960
All of them gossiped about me secretly.

63
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,775
So what?

64
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:54,660
If I had given up like you are right now,

65
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,819
then I wouldn't have what I have today. Right?

66
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:04,960
You even married me so you could write novels.

67
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,260
Why would you be afraid of starting over?

68
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,639
So what if they put a stop to this novel?

69
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:12,550

70

Yes.

What Little Monster? Oh, she is very talented.

She has a great grasp on creativity and the pacing of her stories.

Oh, and she is a good writer.

98
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,040
The future prospects of female-oriented novels are very promising.

99
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,759
In particular, the subsequent derivative (spin-off) dramas and movies will be a big trend.

100
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:20,539
So I am thinking maybe she can try writing romance.

But she has no experience in this.

103
00:07:26,999 --> 00:07:31,725
She is not experienced in emotional delicacy.

104
00:07:31,725 --> 00:07:34,119
You can advise her to find inspiration from people around her.

- Yes.

00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,950
[Domineering CEO's Warm-Hearted New Wife]

166
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,839
This isn't so difficult.

167
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,960
They just want it to be sweet, right?

168
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,279
It's just flirting, right?

169
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:43,180
[Domineering CEO's Warm-Hearted New Wife, Chapter One: He gently lay her on the bed. He gazed at her softly, while she stared back at him with love.]

170
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,779
She stared back. Then what?

171
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,820
And then?

172
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,080
Xiao Xi, help!

173
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:04,040
Family, help me!

174
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:06,559
You're always tagging along. Why are you here?

175
00:12:06,559 --> 00:12:08,800
Jian'an, this is good news.

176
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,640
I didn't expect them to give you an even bigger project.

177
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,100
I was very worried when you went yesterday.

178
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,638
But I've barely even had a boyfriend.

179
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,559
Yet do I have to write about bossy CEOs, lovely wives, and flirting? Let me die.

180
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,479
You have a character prototype at home, right?

181
00:12:21,479 --> 00:12:25,359
You're already a lovely wife.

182
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:28,620
- Take advantage of available materials around you.
- Take advantage of available materials around you!

183
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,320
Are you a copycat?

184
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,959
- Do you mean Lu Bo Yan?
- Yes.

185
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,339
Forget it. His girlfriend is Han Ruo Xi.

186
00:12:36,339 --> 00:12:39,459
I told you already that we're just in a contracted marriage.

187
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:42,220
I don't want to be a mistress.

188
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,900
Stop talking about him.

189
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,479
Hurry and help me think about how I should write this novel.

190
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,820
Jian'an, you've asked the right person.

191
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,800
Holy crap!

192
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,400
Are you blind?

193
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,040
Sorry, sorry.

194
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,320
If apologies were useful, what would we need the police for?

195
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,000
- Stop.
- What?

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,860
That line is too cliché.

197
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:08,819
- So cheesy.
- You two know nothing.

198
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:11,160
This is my practical experience of more than twenty years.

199
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:15,459
- That's why every time you break up, those girls call you an *sshole.
- Who are you calling an *sshole?

200
00:13:15,459 --> 00:13:17,439
And this time, I need to write about a domineering boss.

201
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,100
It's not a campus story.

202
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:22,760
People like Jiang Shao Kai won't ever be a boss.

203
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,940
Jian'an, you should listen to me.

204
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:30,475
President Jiang, your coffee.

205
00:13:30,475 --> 00:13:32,839
Sorry, sorry.

206
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,439
Sorry.

207
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,340
It's okay.

208
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,140
I am used to it.

209
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,539
President Jiang,

210
00:13:42,539 --> 00:13:44,819
you could've chosen a better secretary.

211
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:47,520
Why did you choose me?

212
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,059
- Do you want to know why?
- Yes.

213
00:13:50,059 --> 00:13:53,200
Because you are Luo Xiao Xi.

214
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,240
I'd better resign.

215
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,340
I have caused you too much trouble.

216
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,439
If you resign now, it will be inconvenient for me.

217
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:05,600
I want you to be my girlfriend. Stay and be my secretary.

218
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,740
I don't think that's a good idea.

219
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,240
Come, sit.

220
00:14:14,559 --> 00:14:17,220
Come. Have some coffee.

221
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,948
My goodness! Doing that in the office?

222
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:55,679
Is that not too shameless?

223
00:14:55,679 --> 00:14:58,479
Luo Xiao Xi, what the heck is going on in your head?

224
00:14:58,479 --> 00:15:00,160
Mine is better than yours!

225
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,160
"Woman, do you know you are playing with fire?"

226
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,625
- Are you not afraid of making people wet the bed at night?
- Is yours better than mine?

227
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:09,200
Yours is just, "President Jiang, this is your coffee. Oh my, sorry!"

228
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,999
It's even worse! So fake!

229
00:15:10,999 --> 00:15:15,079
Plus office romances are forbidden in big companies, okay?

230
00:15:15,079 --> 00:15:17,880
What's wrong with an office romance? I can have it if I want!

231
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,040
You vagrant! You need to find a job first, okay?

232
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:22,350
Who is a vagrant? That's a personal attack!

233
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:23,820
- Who is attacking you?
- I'll beat you to death!

234
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,640
Enough, enough. Stop it!

235
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,380
Aren't you here to help me?

236
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,419
Someone like you would be a scourge in the office!

237
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:31,500
You are the scourge! Your whole family is!

238
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,900
- You are the scourge!
- Say it again!

239
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,520
- Again!
- I will beat you to death today! (It will be the death of you!)

240
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,060
- You are the scourge!
- Come here!

241
00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:40,440
President Lu.

242
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,840
You need to sign this.

243
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,120
Bo Yan, bring Jian'an home for dinner tonight.

244
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,120
Okay, Mom.

245
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:06,160
Do you want to contact Miss Su?

246
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,240
I happened to see Miss Su meeting with her friends at the café when I passed by just now.

247
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,380
Should I pick her up from there?

248
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:12,800
Her friends?

249
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,179
The one who climbed to your room last time, Jiang Shao Kai.

250
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:27,120
President Lu, you haven't signed the document yet.

251
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,875
Say it again!

252
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:30,939
What are you doing? Stop tweaking my ear!

253
00:16:30,939 --> 00:16:32,260
Watch me!

254
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:34,359
- Oh my gosh.
- What did you just say?

255
00:16:34,359 --> 00:16:36,550
- You have so many girlfriends!
- Stop, I don't want to argue with you!

256
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:40,000
You jinx! You are such an eyesore!

257
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,160
Hello, what is it?

258
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,000
We're having dinner with Mom tonight. Don't forget.

259
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,700
I got it.

260
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,740
Where are you now?

261
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,299
I'm outside. I am going home now.

262
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:03,720
- By yourself?
- Yes, by myself.

263
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,100
Crazy.

264
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,720
Bo Yan, I've been looking for you.

265
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,079
I made a reservation for tonight. Shall we have dinner together?

266
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,860
I'm busy tonight. Maybe another day.

267
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:22,999
Wait! It's your favorite restaurant!

268
00:17:23,419 --> 00:17:25,440
It took me three days to—

269
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,240
Miss Han.

270
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,359
What's the matter with Bo Yan?

271
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,219
I booked a restaurant, but he has no time.

272
00:17:36,219 --> 00:17:38,359
I think Aunt Tang wants to see him.

273
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:40,359
Don't think too much.

274
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,720
Why don't you go with me?

275
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,879
M-Me?

276
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,679
Never mind if you're busy.

277
00:17:50,499 --> 00:17:52,040
Miss Han, I have time!

278
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,019
Miss Han!

279
00:17:54,019 --> 00:17:57,300
Y-you... Why are you in my bed?

280
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,960
So what?

281
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,639
We are married. What are you afraid of, Baby?

282
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:06,239
But... we had an agreement.

283
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,159
No! You should go.

284
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:15,359
I will be very gentle.

285
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:26,370
Why are you so rude?

286
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:28,770
You need to knock first!

287
00:18:29,419 --> 00:18:31,199
Sorry.

288
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,859
Come, Baby.

289
00:18:45,859 --> 00:18:48,580
Let's continue.

290
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,660
Gosh. You are so bad.

291
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:54,839
Do you like it?

292
00:18:54,839 --> 00:18:56,859
I...

293
00:18:56,859 --> 00:19:00,558
What's wrong with you? Did I not tell you to knock?

294
00:19:09,699 --> 00:19:11,978
Did I not arrange for her to write about a domineering CEO?

295
00:19:11,978 --> 00:19:14,040
What is she doing in there?

296
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:21,259
Uncle Xu, arrange a car for me! I need to go out!

297
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:23,460
Okay, President Lu.

298
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,100
He is... so boring.

299
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:41,000
They're all suits.

300
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,700
But the texture is great.

301
00:19:45,699 --> 00:19:48,078
Stanislavsky (character actor) once said,

302
00:19:48,078 --> 00:19:50,239
"Look for real; listen for real; feel for real."

303
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:53,675
It should be okay for me to try them on, right?

304
00:20:09,639 --> 00:20:12,158
Why won't you leave me?

305
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:15,158
Do not forget your identity. Don't challenge me.

306
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:17,000
No, I want to leave you.

307
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,639
Listen, only I can make you cry from now on.

308
00:20:23,499 --> 00:20:26,780
Why does that sound so familiar?

309
00:20:28,399 --> 00:20:30,720
Why are you here?

310
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,600
It's my room.

311
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,100
Is it strange that I am here?

312
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,320
But you... I didn't know you had this kind of habit.

313
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:42,250
No. I don't...

314
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,119
Not me!

315
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,559
Take it off.

316
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:56,680
What do you want? Why should I?

317
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:59,939
Does he like this style? Don't tell me he wants...

318
00:20:59,939 --> 00:21:03,258
Take it off. We're going to my mom's house.

319
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:27,480
- Aunt Tang... We are here to see you.
- Yes... Hey.

320
00:21:28,119 --> 00:21:31,259
- Why are you still calling me Aunt Tang? Call me Mom.
- Okay.

321
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,600
Mom.

322
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,239
I will personally cook some delicious dishes for you guys today.

323
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,279
Thank you, Mom.

324
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,919
You haven't come here in a long time.

325
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:41,399
You used to come here to play a lot when you were children.

326
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,578
- Bo Yan... Come.
- What? Yes.

327
00:21:43,578 --> 00:21:47,139
Take Jian'an to look around. I'll make some good food for you.

328
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,779
Okay, Mom.

329
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:08,819
It's exactly like it was when we were young. Nothing has changed.

330
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,779
This is the Transformers figure I broke, right?

331
00:22:13,779 --> 00:22:15,579
Did you fix it?

332
00:22:15,579 --> 00:22:18,039
Where did I break it?

333
00:22:19,499 --> 00:22:21,799
I remember it was here.

334
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,539
What are you looking at?

335
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,879
Who wants to look at you?

336
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:58,380
It's very rude to take my stuff without my permission.

337
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:06,459
He's so nervous.

338
00:23:06,459 --> 00:23:09,420
There must be some secret in there.

339
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:12,200
I will discover it.

340
00:23:25,259 --> 00:23:27,259
Nailed it.

341
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,160
Let me go!

342
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,740
Are you throwing yourself at me?

343
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,520
I won't look at it anymore. Hurry and let me go.

344
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:39,998
- If Mom sees this—
- She would be happy to see this.

345
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,779
Is she a dog?

346
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,700
- Mom, let me help you.
- Okay.

347
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:02,258
Smelly radish. Smelly radish. Smelly radish.

348
00:24:02,258 --> 00:24:05,239
Jian'an, do you not like radish?

349
00:24:05,239 --> 00:24:08,818
- No, Mom. I love it.
- Okay.

350
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,599
Jian'an, did you professionally learn slicing techniques or something?

351
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:18,459
No. I learned it while I lived alone.

352
00:24:18,459 --> 00:24:22,838
After graduation, my dad kept asking me to work at his company, but I refused.

353
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:25,099
He cut off my money out of anger.

354
00:24:25,099 --> 00:24:28,519
And I didn't want to concede to him so I never asked him for money.

355
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:31,039
But I don't have a stable income from writing novels.

356
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,479
To save money, I have to cook for myself.

357
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:35,599
Jian'an, you've had it hard.

358
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,398
Your dad just wants to protect you.

359
00:24:37,398 --> 00:24:41,159
I know, but I really don't want to go to work in his company.

360
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:43,039
I don't want to be a lingerie queen either.

361
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,598
I just want to publish my own novel.

362
00:24:45,598 --> 00:24:47,699
It's my dream.

363
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:53,710
["Hello, Ms. Alien": Chapter One]

364
00:25:01,359 --> 00:25:03,920
Are you writing novels?

365
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,179
Interesting!

366
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,558
When did you take that? Who allowed you to see it?

367
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:12,079
I'm serious. You have talent in writing.

368
00:25:12,079 --> 00:25:14,120
Do you think I can do it?

369
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,998
Of course! But you need my guidance.

370
00:25:17,998 --> 00:25:19,918
Come, look at this. Look.

371
00:25:19,918 --> 00:25:21,978
If you make the hero's motive more reasonable,

372
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:24,779
it would be much better.

373
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:29,498
It deepens the conflict between the protagonists. Do you understand?

374
00:25:31,179 --> 00:25:33,899
You are a professional.

375
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:37,719
Help me. Have a look at this. It's the second chapter.

376
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,760
I'll support you. I think you have always been good at writing since childhood.

377
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,620
Right, Bo Yan?

378
00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:48,579
Yes.

379
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,640
Jian'an, you have no plans tonight, right?

380
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:59,500
- No.
- Okay, sleep here.

381
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,380
You can go home tomorrow.

382
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:09,119
Okay.

383
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,958
Here. Okay, I will take care of the rest.

384
00:26:13,958 --> 00:26:16,300
- You take the fruit out there.
- Okay, Mom.

385
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,639
Wifey, let me do it.

386
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,780
He sure is good at acting.

387
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,519
Jian'an. Come, have a try.

388
00:26:34,519 --> 00:26:36,778
It's radish rib soup. Try it.

389
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:38,739
Do you like it?

390
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:45,118
It smells so good, Mom!

391
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:47,560
And all of these dishes are my favorites!

392
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,458
Especially the braised beef with potatoes.

393
00:26:49,458 --> 00:26:50,798
I was abroad for so many years,

394
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,456
but Mom's braised beef with potatoes remain the best.

395
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,099
Eat more if you like them.

396
00:26:54,099 --> 00:26:56,239
You often came to eat with us when you were younger.

397
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,739
I remembered these dishes were your favorite.

398
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:02,316
It still tastes the same. Thank you, Mom!

399
00:27:02,316 --> 00:27:04,319
Eat up.

400
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,398
- I'll serve you some soup.
- Thank you.

401
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:14,759
- Here.
- Thank you.

402
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,619
Have some soup.

403
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,340
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

404
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:52,058
This one is so great, Mom!

405
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:55,279
- You should teach me!
- All right.

406
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:13,499
Miss Han, please sit down.

407
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,040
Thank you.

408
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:22,919
This bouquet is for you.

409
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,159
So beautiful.

410
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:34,180
I hear Bo Yan invested in the literature network at the original shareholder's ratio that was discussed.

411
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,579
Yes. But no one understands what President Lu is thinking.

412
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:43,270
Do you think he has been a bit weird recently?

413
00:28:43,270 --> 00:28:47,270
I think maybe he has been too busy.

414
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,000
Don't cover up for him.

415
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,260
He has always been busy,

416
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:53,780
but he was never like this.

417
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:58,100
Miss Han, you are hungry, right? We should order some dishes first.

418
00:29:21,079 --> 00:29:22,999
Here, drink some water.

419
00:29:22,999 --> 00:29:25,400
- Thank you, Mom.
- Thank you, Mom.

420
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,180
- Are you full?
- Yes, I'm full.

421
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,780
Jian'an, Bo Yan.

422
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:33,280
I want to discuss something with you very seriously.

423
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,480
When will you have a baby?

424
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,274
Let me tell you,

425
00:29:39,274 --> 00:29:41,959
I've even come up with several names already for my grandchildren.

426
00:29:41,959 --> 00:29:48,620
- Mom.
- Mom, actually, we have discussed this already.

427
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:55,618
At that time, you said you wanted a boy, but I said I wanted a girl.

428
00:29:55,618 --> 00:29:58,340
You didn't forget about it so quickly, did you?

429
00:30:02,359 --> 00:30:04,819
Just you wait. I'll remember this.

430
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:07,420
Great. I'll wait and see how you'll get back at me.

431
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,919
Jian'an, don't be nervous.

432
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,579
I'm not trying to rush you. It's fine as long as you guys have a plan.

433
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:17,498
However, Jian'an, I know you often work very late.

434
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:19,639
You need to take care of your health.

435
00:30:19,639 --> 00:30:22,439
If you don't want a baby now, it's okay.

436
00:30:22,439 --> 00:30:23,940
Fine, Mom.

437
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:27,019
Bo Yan, you should care more about Jian'an.

438
00:30:27,019 --> 00:30:29,649
Don't just focus on your work all day and forget about your wife.

439
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:31,118
Sure, Mom.

440
00:30:31,118 --> 00:30:35,798
Okay, okay. It's late now. I will leave you two to talk.

441
00:30:35,798 --> 00:30:38,360
I have prepared the room for you.

442
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:41,078
Go to bed early.

443
00:30:41,078 --> 00:30:43,380
Okay, Mom.

444
00:30:57,879 --> 00:31:00,839
- Which room will I sleep in?
- Here.

445
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:03,739
Why are you undressing?

446
00:31:03,739 --> 00:31:05,900
- To take a bath.
- What?

447
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,259
Are we sleeping in the same room?

448
00:31:09,259 --> 00:31:11,959
If we sleep in separate rooms,

449
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:15,300
what will my mom think?

450
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:18,340
Did you plan this on purpose from the start?

451
00:31:19,759 --> 00:31:22,839
- I did remind you.
- You reminded me?

452
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:24,679
You reminded me, but I didn't get it.

453
00:31:24,679 --> 00:31:27,599
Why did you not tell me earlier?

454
00:31:27,599 --> 00:31:29,199
I thought you were the one being impatient.

455
00:31:29,199 --> 00:31:32,000
As your husband, how could I make my wife anxious?

456
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:35,420
It's all my fault. I overestimated your IQ.

457
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:37,499
It won't happen again next time.

458
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,200
Oh my gosh.

459
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,280
Do we really have to share the same bed?

460
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,520
What are you looking at?

461
00:32:19,499 --> 00:32:21,015
I'll have to charge you money if you keep looking at me.

462
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:23,500
You're just so-so.

463
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,159
I'm going to take a shower.

464
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:23,460
I can't let you look at me for free.

465
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,399
It's my turn to look now.

466
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:33,399
What the heck am I thinking?

467
00:33:36,599 --> 00:33:40,219
- What?
- You forgot to take the pajamas Mom prepared for you.

468
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,679
Oh.

469
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,899
Oh my gosh!

470
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:00,479
It's the new style from my dad's company.

471
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:04,339
Mom, you're too thoughtful.

472
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:08,900
[Jiang Shao Kai]

473
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:13,998
- Hello.
- Jian'an.

474
00:34:13,998 --> 00:34:17,539
President Du said you need to submit the manuscript by tomorrow. How's your progress?

475
00:34:17,539 --> 00:34:21,679
I am writing it now. I will submit it on time tomorrow.

476
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,438
What, oh, what am I to do?

477
00:34:26,438 --> 00:34:29,119
Jian'an, why are you hesitating?

478
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,438
Being in the same room as President Lu is a great opportunity!

479
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:34,079
Go! Draw material from him.

480
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,699
No, don't forget your agreement.

481
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:40,039
Within a year, no physical contact is allowed.

482
00:34:40,039 --> 00:34:44,125
How can you write a good novel without dedicating yourself to the arts?

483
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:46,518
Lu Bo Yan is a devil.

484
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,759
Don't put yourself in danger.

485
00:34:48,759 --> 00:34:51,899
Good for you. Will you already delay submitting the first chapter manuscript?

486
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,899
How will you explain it to President Du?

487
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,919
No pain, no gain!

488
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:27,420
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

489
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:29,940
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

490
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:34,570
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

491
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,720
♫ Yes ♫

492
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:38,370
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

493
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:42,690
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

494
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:46,140
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

495
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:49,990
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

496
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,750
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

497
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:55,440
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

498
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,180
♫ The signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

499
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:00,820
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

500
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:04,600
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

501
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,690
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

502
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:13,520
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

503
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,100
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

504
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:19,960
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

505
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:22,750
♫ Warning all problems ♫

506
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,480
♫ To stay away from us ♫

507
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:28,110
♫ No one can take my place ♫

508
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:31,870
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

509
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,930
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

510
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:40,960
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
