Say it. Why did you ask me to come here?

15
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:30,080
I have terminated all my membership cards to bars.

16
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,000
Okay.

- What!

23
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:52,200
I won't miss you! Goodbye!

24
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:54,080

You didn't set it so that I'm the only one who can see it, did you?

00:02:37,639 --> 00:02:39,680
Of course not.

I don't think that's appropriate. It's broad daylight.

Don't be so hasty.

Take it back now.

53
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:24,460
President, save it.

54
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,139
Think it over again.

55
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:31,259
You have been with us for so many years.

56
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,325
We have been working so well together.

57
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:35,340
What is the use of that?

Su Jian'an is the wife of the big boss.

President, just save it.

These are two different things, Xuan Xuan.

61
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:49,365
Literature is about being open to different ideas.

62
00:03:49,365 --> 00:03:53,139
Two talents cannot be in the same company, unless they're opposite genders.

63
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,400
As long as Su Jian'an is here,

64
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,199
I have no future!

The contract is right here. You need to sign it.

68
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,679
I'll make sure to pay you every yuan of the liquidated damages.

69
00:04:10,679 --> 00:04:12,300

75
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,239
Wasn't everything going well for her? Why is she leaving so suddenly?

76
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,400
I nurtured her for so many years,

77
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,920
but now, all my efforts are going to benefit another company!

78
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:55,520
I'm sure President Bao of Chunjiang Literature Network is behind this.

79
00:04:58,719 --> 00:05:01,220
Mrs. Lu isn't updating anymore,

80
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:02,939
and Xuan Xuan is leaving now.

81
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:08,150
It looks like our literature network will lose its advantage in female-oriented novels.

Xiao Yong, you aren't leaving me too, are you?

You are so nice.

00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:20,579
Why would I leave?

85
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,980
You will get a pay raise starting next month.

It will take a few more days.

92

I want to update the rest of this new novel all at once

93
00:06:34,559 --> 00:06:37,420
to cause a sensational effect.

94
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:39,220
I think that's a good idea.

95
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,320
Then the literature network will also promote it all over the site.

96
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,775
Integrated marketing with building, car and ground advertisements will create an even greater effect.

Bo Yan, I want to attract readers with good content.

98

If readers like it, naturally it will spread by word of mouth.

99
00:06:53,899 --> 00:06:56,380
We would not need to advertise or increase the traffic on purpose.

What readers' genuine feedback?

102
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:01,940
Yes.

103
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:04,060
I want to know what parts aren't good enough,

104
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:06,859
then I can do my best to improve.

105
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:10,200
Then are the ideas that I gave you earlier enough?

106
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:14,520
Will they think they're too cliché and repetitive?

107
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,300
Do you have any new ideas?

108

If you are tired, we should go to bed early.

President Lu, do we need to help Sister-in-Law promote her novel?

113
00:08:21,359 --> 00:08:24,880
Jian'an says that she wants to rely on her own efforts,

114
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:29,850
but I think it would be okay if we helped her publicize it

115
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:34,800

Mrs. Lu, look at you.

00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,999
Why didn't you take a few more days off?

128
00:11:26,999 --> 00:11:30,459
You didn't need to update the novel so soon.

129

You are just like your husband.

130

You are so professional!

131
00:11:34,439 --> 00:11:37,078
President, you should call me Jian'an.

132
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:39,060
It sounds more pleasant.

133
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,799
O-Okay, Jian'an.

134
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,200
Jian'an!

135
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,278
Sister Jian'an, the moment you updated your novel,

it shot to first place on the female-oriented novel ranking list.

137

You're amazing!

138
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,539
Now, I can officially announce

139
00:11:49,539 --> 00:11:54,858
that Su Jian'an has formally become a platinum novelist of our literature network.

140
00:11:54,858 --> 00:11:56,499
Wow!

Thank you, President! Thank you, all.

142
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:04,619
Jian'an, I know that publishing a novel has always been your goal.

143
00:12:04,619 --> 00:12:05,538
Yes.

144
00:12:05,538 --> 00:12:07,079
According to our company standards,

145
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:09,319
we can start taking pre-orders for your novel.

146
00:12:09,319 --> 00:12:12,975
As long as the pre-orders exceed 100,000 books in two weeks,

147
00:12:12,975 --> 00:12:17,850
you can officially publish your book in print.

148
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,960
Does it need to be 100,000 books?

149
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,578
Jian'an, don't worry.

150
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,579
Your novel has almost exceeded 100 million clicks now.

151
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:32,919
The 100,000 orders are a piece of cake for you.

152
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:49,579
Ultra Alien, are you there?

153
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:51,119
Yes, Chief.

154
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:55,300
There's a chance that my novel will be published.

155
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,519
That's good news!

156
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,158
You have worked hard for so many years. You deserve it.

157
00:12:59,158 --> 00:13:01,578
However, according to company regulations,

158
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:03,419
I need to have 100,000 pre-orders.

159
00:13:03,419 --> 00:13:06,580
I have no confidence.

160
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,919
Be confident.

161
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:10,159
Your novel is number one in female-oriented novels now.

162
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:12,160
It won't be a problem.

163
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,219
Really?

164
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,299
Of course. Don't forget,

165

President Kang, don't say that.

324
00:22:49,638 --> 00:22:51,819
That is what I should do.

325
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,240
Song Yu, people should be conscientious (do what is right).

326
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:03,760
We should know how to differentiate what we should do and what we shouldn't do.

327
00:23:06,199 --> 00:23:09,400
I'm sorry, President Kang. I know I was wrong.

328
00:23:11,499 --> 00:23:13,239
It's good to hear that.

329
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,639
Sister, you're back.

330
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:31,600
Yue Yue, what are the news about Su Jian'an lately?

331
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,838
As far as I know, Su Jian'an is going to publish a novel,

332
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,324
and she is competing with another author.

333
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:43,419
President Lu even designed the novel cover with her.

334
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:54,990
["Young Master" by Su Jian'an vs. Queen of Romance, Chen Xuan Xuan's "Prince," two sweet novels simultaneously take pre-orders.]

335
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:08,399
Chen Xuan Xuan?

336
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,560
I guess I'll do you a favor.

337
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:39,860
Everyone will have a bright and free future.

338
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,719
Su Jian'an, it seems you have offended quite a few people.

339
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,479
Don't blame me.

340
00:24:51,479 --> 00:24:54,379
Su Jian'an is having an affair with producer, Kang Rui Cheng.

341
00:24:54,379 --> 00:24:55,699
Evidence of the two running lines with each other affectionately

342
00:24:55,699 --> 00:24:57,139
is all shown in a video.

343
00:24:57,139 --> 00:24:58,818
There was a rift in Su and Lu's relationship long ago.

344
00:24:58,818 --> 00:25:00,719
Their sweetness is all for show.

345
00:25:00,719 --> 00:25:03,700
Now, thousands of people are cancelling their pre-orders of "Young Master Lu."

346
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,799
Luo Xiao Xi, it's time to get up!

347
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:08,700
What time is it already? Are you still sleeping?

348
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,839
Your breakfast will become brunch soon! Get up!

349
00:25:14,075 --> 00:25:17,358
The pre-orders of novels by Jian'an should have already exceeded 100,000 books, right?

350
00:25:17,358 --> 00:25:19,280
Let me see.

351
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,940
Holy cr*p! What the heck!

352
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:28,179
Why are you shouting?

353
00:25:28,179 --> 00:25:31,680
People are cancelling their pre-orders of the novel by Jian'an!

354
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:41,639
Everyone will have a bright and free future.

355
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:48,900
I can prove that Jian'an is innocent!

356
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:51,139
I was rehearsing with President Kang at the time.

357
00:25:51,139 --> 00:25:53,660
And from this angle...

358
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:58,475
I think Han Ruo Xi secretly recorded it.

359
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:02,479
The current public opinion is damaging the image of Jian'an.

360
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:07,080
Look. The pre-orders are still being cancelled.

361
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,579
It's moving farther and farther away from our publishing goal.

362
00:26:09,579 --> 00:26:11,880
Shut up, and stop jinxing it!

363
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,724
Actually, I can make a statement to clarify it.

364
00:26:17,724 --> 00:26:22,675
But a unilateral statement will not make much of a difference.

365
00:26:22,675 --> 00:26:25,380
I am afraid it will just get worse.

366
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,918
That b*tch, Han Ruo Xi!

367
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,599
I am so angry!

368
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,874
Moreover, the problem isn't whether we'll have enough pre-orders to publish the book anymore.

369
00:26:33,874 --> 00:26:38,919
I am afraid President Lu will misunderstand.

370
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,660
I will go to see Bo Yan now.

371
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:02,119
President Kang! President Kang.

372
00:27:02,119 --> 00:27:03,579
Miss Su...

373
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:05,180
What happened?

374
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:13,800
Everyone will have a bright and free future.

375
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,359
President Lu, we are trying to contact the media to delete the video,

376
00:27:23,359 --> 00:27:27,199
but it's hard to change the reputation of Sister-in-Law's novel.

377
00:27:27,199 --> 00:27:29,199
Given the current circumstances,

378
00:27:29,199 --> 00:27:31,299
clarification won't make much of a difference.

379
00:27:31,299 --> 00:27:34,940
Do you mean you want to contact Kang Rui Cheng?

380
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,878
With the current situation, all three parties need to clarify this together

381
00:27:38,878 --> 00:27:42,058
in order to reduce negative public opinion and reduce the rate of pre-order cancellations.

382
00:27:42,058 --> 00:27:43,740
Bo Yan!

383
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,940
You don't have the wrong idea, do you?

384
00:27:48,579 --> 00:27:50,719
I am indeed a little unhappy.

385
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,980
- At the time, we were—
- Quiet.

386
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,619
My IQ is not that low.

387
00:27:56,619 --> 00:28:00,099
It's obvious someone secretly recorded you when you were rehearsing the script.

388
00:28:00,099 --> 00:28:03,819
I think... Han Ruo Xi did it.

389
00:28:20,119 --> 00:28:21,859
Thank you.

390
00:28:24,359 --> 00:28:29,259
Jian'an, don't worry. We will find a solution.

391
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,400
President Kang.

392
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,899
Miss Su.

393
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:46,179
President Lu.

394
00:28:46,179 --> 00:28:48,739
You are here because of what happened to Jian'an, right?

395
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:01,839
President Kang, this happened all because of you.

396
00:29:01,839 --> 00:29:05,860
I think you should take all the responsibility.

397
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:09,079
Yes. It happened within my film crew.

398
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,959
I cannot avoid the responsibility.

399
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:14,819
So I am here to apologize to both of you.

400
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,819
So... what will you do?

401
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:21,958
I think the three of us should clarify this together

402
00:29:21,958 --> 00:29:24,925
to stop the rumors and set the record straight.

403
00:29:24,925 --> 00:29:27,079
Thank you, President Kang.

404
00:29:27,079 --> 00:29:30,219
You are welcome. This is what I should do.

405
00:29:30,219 --> 00:29:33,439
So what will you do with the person who recorded it?

406
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:40,418
If you two trust me and are willing to give Han Ruo Xi a chance,

407
00:29:40,418 --> 00:29:42,679
I will talk about this with Miss Han alone.

408
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,225
If she does this again, the Ruijin Group also won't tolerate an artist with bad conduct.

409
00:29:48,225 --> 00:29:50,259
Let's blacklist her.

410
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,919
Since my wife wants to let it go,

411
00:29:56,919 --> 00:29:59,380
let bygones be bygones then.

412
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:03,000
I'll see you tomorrow at the company.

413
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,819
Thank you.

414
00:30:04,819 --> 00:30:08,779
President Lu, Miss Su, I'll see you tomorrow.

415
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:33,450
President Kang, how do you want to explain the video that was exposed online?

416
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:36,899
It happened during the filming of our movie.

417
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,778
It was when I ran lines with Miss Su.

418
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:43,118
I brought the script today.

419
00:30:43,118 --> 00:30:45,439
You can check it later,

420
00:30:45,439 --> 00:30:49,475
and you can also wait to see this scene when the film comes out.

421
00:30:49,475 --> 00:30:52,959
So the online rumors are not true.

422
00:30:52,959 --> 00:30:55,579
I respect Miss Su very much.

423
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:58,759
She is an outstanding screenwriter and novelist.

424
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:02,918
I hope you will tell the truth about her. Give readers the truth.

425
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:05,460
Miss Su, is that true?

426
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,659
Yes. President Kang is a colleague whom I respect very much

427
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,480
so all the online rumors are false.

428
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,480
Miss Su, will the rumors affect your relationship with President Lu?

429
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,920
My husband and I have always had a great relationship.

430
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,559
He supports me a lot

431
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,018
and gives me a lot of space.

432
00:31:24,018 --> 00:31:26,119
Thank you, Honey.

433
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:32,259
President Lu, how will you handle this?

434
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:39,595
I will find out who recorded the video and who spread the rumors.

435
00:31:39,595 --> 00:31:40,999
Do you have any more questions?

436
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,899
If not, please report according to the truth.

437
00:31:43,899 --> 00:31:45,959
I have a question.

438
00:31:45,959 --> 00:31:49,520
Miss Su, as President Lu's wife, you know that these companies are competitors.

439
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,759
Why did you join President Kang's crew?

440
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:56,359
First, I was very interested in this project.

441
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:00,359
Second, President Kang and I share many of the same ideas.

442
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,778
We click very well in many aspects

443
00:32:02,778 --> 00:32:05,398
so we cooperated well together.

444
00:32:05,398 --> 00:32:09,819
So it sounds like you're saying President Kang is your soulmate. What about President Lu then?

445
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:12,520
President Kang, you clearly knew Miss Su was President Lu's wife,

446
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,839
yet you ran lines with her late at night, causing this controversy!

447
00:32:14,839 --> 00:32:17,298
Did you not think about avoiding suspicion?

448
00:32:17,298 --> 00:32:21,940
President Lu, Miss Su joined President Kang's crew and ran lines with him so late at night. What do you think of it?

449
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,081
Geez. This is going to get out of hand.

450
00:32:23,081 --> 00:32:25,139
Which company do you work for?

451
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:49,990
