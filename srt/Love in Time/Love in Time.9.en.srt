Say it.

Okay, I will take her there right away.

Is she supposed to be a Chinese medicine doctor with decades of experience?

48
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:11,519
Five generations of my family have practiced Chinese medicine.

I've been seeing patients with my mom ever since I was in her abdomen

Well, do you need a doctor or not?

- Stick out your tongue.
- What?

Stick out your tongue.

a deficiency of qi and blood,

61

People have two fundamentals.

88

The kidney is the innate (natural, inborn) fundamental.

89
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,960
The stomach is the acquired fundamental.

90

They have a connection.

91
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,759
When the acquired fundamental goes wrong,

92
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,418
the innate fundamental will also be affected.

93
00:05:16,418 --> 00:05:19,820
And what consequences will that lead to?

To treat stomach aches, you need mild, gradual care.

00:09:49,819 --> 00:09:50,839
All right. Let's get to business.

169
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:52,860
Today, I will take you to see a few influential bosses.

170
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,599
They all have projects on hand.

171
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,419
Seize the opportunity and your career will soar into the stratosphere.

172
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:59,519
It all depends on your luck.

173
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,920
A'mai.

174
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,999
Tell me some interview tips

175
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,959
so I can prepare in advance.

176
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,558
- Do you want interview tips?
- Yes.

177
00:10:07,559 --> 00:10:09,479
The question is whether or not you want to get famous.

178
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:10,559
Yes, sure.

179
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,020
I can't hear you.

180
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:13,620
Yes!

181
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,919
Let's go.

182
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,278
Why did you bring me to karaoke?

183
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,800
This interview isn't like being a hostess, right?

184
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,179
That's a type of social engagement.

185
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,758
So if things follow the usual chain of events,

186
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:38,500
will I have to sleep with them too?

187
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,579
Please.

188
00:10:39,579 --> 00:10:40,900
How superficial and vulgar!

189
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:44,200
I survived in this industry using my ability.

190
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:46,679
I couldn't tell.

191
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:49,020
A newcomer like you has no connections.

192
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:50,779
How will you get jobs

193
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:52,879
if you don't familiarize yourself with a few more people?

194
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:53,720
What are you looking at?

195
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,678
Let's go.

196
00:10:54,679 --> 00:10:56,280
Come, come, Xiao Xi.

197
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,975
Let me introduce you.

198
00:10:57,975 --> 00:11:00,700
This is President Qian of Mingyuan Pictures.

199
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,250
This is Sister Qiao of Qifeng Entertainment.

200
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,040
This is a senior in our industry, Brother Qin.

201
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,980
This is our rookie artist,

202
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,819
Luo Xiao Xi. Please take good care of her.

203
00:11:10,819 --> 00:11:13,260
Xiao Xi, this person is incredible.

204
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,319
This is Young Master Kai from Taoran Literature Network.

205
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,721
- He has projects on hand.
- Young Master Kai?

206
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:21,239
- Young Master Kai.
- Okay, I will come see you tonight.

207
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,539
- Young Master Kai.
- Goodness.

208
00:11:22,539 --> 00:11:23,959
It really is Jiang Shao Kai!

209
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,558
What?

210
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:26,959
This...

211
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:30,680
A'mai. I forgot to turn off my electric kettle at home. I have to go back now!

212
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:32,159
Stop!

213
00:11:38,159 --> 00:11:40,825
What did you say your name was?

214
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:44,760
I can't run away from what I'm meant to face.

215
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,559
It's me, Luo Xiao Xi.

216
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,975
Young Master Kai, do you know each other?

217
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,179
No, it's my first time meeting her.

218
00:11:58,179 --> 00:12:00,140
Luo Xiao Xi, right?

219
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,080
She has potential.

220
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,280
Young Master Kai, you have such good taste.

221
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,278
Xiao Xi has a good foundation.

222
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:10,358
She is not trained professionally, but she has the talent for this.

223
00:12:10,358 --> 00:12:12,575
So you want to be an actress?

224
00:12:12,575 --> 00:12:16,500
She needs to show us her skills then.

225
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:21,599
Luo Xiao Xi, I will teach you a lesson today.

226
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,799
Jiang Shao Kai, you want a good spanking, do you?

227
00:12:26,475 --> 00:12:27,679
What are you doing?

228
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,179
Go.

229
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,679
Young Master Kai, I am a newcomer.

230
00:12:34,679 --> 00:12:36,900
What kind of skills would I have?

231
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,750
But I am quite good at acupuncture.

232
00:12:41,879 --> 00:12:43,120
It‘s our first time meeting

233
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,720
so let me drink to you.

234
00:12:57,699 --> 00:13:01,279
Please give me your help in the future.

235
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,919
I'll drink up first.

236
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,199
I drank it all up.

237
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,640
Young Master Kai, it's your turn.

238
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:21,819
You're a good drinker.

239
00:13:21,819 --> 00:13:24,559
Sister Qiao, I drank it up,

240
00:13:24,559 --> 00:13:26,439
but Young Master Kai isn't drinking!

241
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,299
He's clearly bullying a newcomer right now!

242
00:13:29,299 --> 00:13:33,461
Young Master Kai, you can't take advantage of a young woman like that.

243
00:13:33,461 --> 00:13:37,459
Young Master Kai, don't embarrass us, okay?

244
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:41,338
I'll drink! Of course, I must.

245
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:49,100
You are such a good drinker.

246
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,240
Come. Drink more.

247
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,920
For this second glass, you'll get used to it after a second time.

248
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,620
Good things should be doubled, right?

249
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,620
Come on, Young Master Kai.

250
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,020
Cheers!

251
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,280
It's no big deal!

252
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,680
Let's drink!

253
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,240
- Let's continue!
- Fine, fine!

254
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,680
- Come on.
- Come on then!

255
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,940
[0760 Plus]

256
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,939
Where are you going?

257
00:14:55,939 --> 00:14:57,398
I'm going home.

258
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,079
Come to my house and we'll keep drinking.

259
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:00,239
Fine.

260
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,100
Bring it on.

261
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,539
My home. My home.

262
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:04,860
Where is my home?

263
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,638
Bay Plaza, Building Six.

264
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:08,758
- Okay.
- Yes.

265
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,360
Building Six.

266
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,959
You want to bully the newcomer, right?

267
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,459
I will let you know who is the bigger drinker.

268
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:31,779
Luo Xiao Xi,

269
00:15:31,779 --> 00:15:34,800
I will win against you today.

270
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,740
Will you? Look at you.

271
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
You want...

272
00:15:46,819 --> 00:15:49,340
What are you looking at?

273
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,860
Have you never seen a beautiful fairy before?

274
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:53,638
I am looking at you.

275
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:54,719
Do you have a problem with that?

276
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,558
Don't you dare look at me again.

277
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,159
I'm looking right now.

278
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,819
What can you do about it?

279
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,459
I will eat you.

280
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,680
Gosh. Jiang Shao Kai, you are in trouble.

281
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:09,279
- Last night...
- It was an accident.

282
00:17:09,279 --> 00:17:10,360
Exactly. It was all...

283
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,639
It was my fault for being so impulsive.

284
00:17:11,639 --> 00:17:14,759
Let's just pretend it never happened, okay?

285
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:16,519
- No, wait!
- Let me tell you, Jiang Shao Kai,

286
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,860
I won't take responsibility for you!

287
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:19,798
Don't even think about it!

288
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,124
Luo Xiao Xi!

289
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,919
What? Do you want to marry into the Luo family?

290
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,620
In your dreams!

291
00:17:25,979 --> 00:17:28,299
You're turning your back on me!

292
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,060
Xiao Xi, open the door.

293
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:32,318
Jian'an!

294
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,719
Xiao Xi?

295
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,340
Good thing I have a key.

296
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,879
- Jian'an has the key to my house!
- Oh, no!

297
00:17:54,459 --> 00:17:56,680
Is no one here?

298
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,350
Jian'an, you're back.

299
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:02,610
Xiao Xi, you are at home.

300
00:18:04,739 --> 00:18:07,101
Did you have fun with President Lu?

301
00:18:07,101 --> 00:18:10,841
It was okay. It's so hot today. Why are you wrapping yourself up in a quilt?

302
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,939
I have an audition in a few days.

303
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:16,380
I'm looking for inspiration for my character!

304
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,699
What kind of role are you playing?

305
00:18:18,699 --> 00:18:20,425
You're wrapping yourself up like a sticky rice dumpling.

306
00:18:20,425 --> 00:18:23,019
Yes, a sticky rice dumpling!

307
00:18:24,359 --> 00:18:25,581
What are you doing?

308
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:28,401
Going home. Lu Bo Yan is waiting for me downstairs.

309
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,580
Right, right. A married couple need to be with each other more often.

310
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,100
You should develop your relationship.

311
00:18:33,699 --> 00:18:35,900
- That's not funny.
- Hey!

312
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,179
Where are you going?

313
00:18:37,179 --> 00:18:38,760
I'm going in to pack up my things.

314
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:40,340
Why are you being weird today?

315
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,050
Don't keep President Lu waiting downstairs.

316
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:44,300
I will pack up your things and send them to you immediately!

317
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,659
No need. Just let him wait.

318
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:48,519
Jian'an!

319
00:18:50,659 --> 00:18:53,479
D*mn it, she's going to find out!

320
00:18:54,259 --> 00:18:56,380
Why is nothing happening?

321
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,780
Why are you stopping me? I have to pack my things.

322
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,539
Here goes nothing.

323
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,699
Su Jian'an, look!

324
00:19:19,699 --> 00:19:21,380
Luo Xiao Xi, you exhibitionist!

325
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,459
Put your clothes on!

326
00:19:26,219 --> 00:19:28,679
I can't believe you.

327
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:38,179
I know yours are big, okay?

328
00:19:38,179 --> 00:19:40,219
Don't show off in front of me.

329
00:19:40,219 --> 00:19:42,580
But you are so weird today.

330
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:45,925
Go and get yourself checked out if need be.

331
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,719
- Where is my computer?
- Computer?

332
00:20:11,459 --> 00:20:14,040
Jiang Shao Kai!

00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:18,559
My computer!

334
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,860
Jian'an, if I tell you that I am doing a PowerPoint,

335
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:23,840
will you believe me?

336
00:20:34,459 --> 00:20:36,499
Say it! When did you get together?

337
00:20:36,499 --> 00:20:37,599
- We didn't!
- We didn't!

338
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,739
It's not what you think!
[You'll never know, Dear, how much I love you.]

339
00:20:38,739 --> 00:20:40,078
- It's his fault!
- It's her fault!

340
00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:41,620
- Why are you repeating my words?
- I'm not!

341
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:44,440
Are you stupid? Of all things, why did you take the computer owned by Jian'an?

342
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,420
How would I know she was here to get her computer?

343
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:53,300
Actually, I am very happy that you are together.

344
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,559
Why do you have to hide it from me?

345
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:58,540
Me with him? I am not that desperate.

346
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:02,300
Luo Xiao Xi! The line of girls waiting to be my girlfriend goes all the way to France!

347
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,125
Don't talk like that when you clearly benefited from this!

348
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,620
Does it look like I want to have anything to do with you?

349
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,300
Jiang Shao Kai, do you want me to teach you a lesson?

350
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:10,499
Stop!

351
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:12,879
Can you not have a nice talk?

352
00:21:12,879 --> 00:21:15,340
Since this beautiful misunderstanding has already happened,

353
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,950
just stop arguing, okay?

354
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:20,520
You should calm down and have a good talk.

355
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:22,860
- Who wants to have a good talk with him?
- Who wants to have a good talk with her?

356
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,939
Okay. I have to go now.

357
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,159
Stop arguing.

358
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,459
That took you quite a long time.

359
00:21:59,459 --> 00:22:01,960
It's a long story.

360
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,660
Let me help you.

361
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,800
Where is your computer?

362
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:09,939
I need to go to the Apple Store.

363
00:22:09,939 --> 00:22:11,380
Why?

364
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,380
To buy a new computer.

365
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,479
Okay. Let's go.

Teacher Jian'an, have a taste.

369
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:32,940
Thank you, President.

370

Jian'an.

371
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:38,960
Your last few chapters...

372
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,300
were so wonderful!

373
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,839
You even added a love triangle.

374
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:47,959
The plot has gotten more complicated now.

375
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,518
The last twist, especially,

376
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:53,559
totally catches you off guard.

377
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:57,040
So it was all the male protagonist's setup!

378
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,979
So heart-wrenching yet sweet.

379
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:02,680
I can't stop reading!

380
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:07,040
Your writing is so detailed and you've grasped the psychology of the characters so accurately.

00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,219
I admire you so much!

382

Of course, they do!

Do you feel sick?

President, if there is nothing else,

389
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,680
I'll go home now.

00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,479
Okay, I will see you out.

391

There's no need.

Okay.

You should go back and get some more rest.

394

As for your next update, take your time.

395
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:48,659
- Then I will go now.
- Okay. Go back now.

396
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,780
- What are you doing?
- Su Jian'an, you have no conscience.

397
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,079
You haven't contacted me for days.

398
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,140
I've been busy writing my novel.

399
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:03,060
I haven't even asked you yet! What's going on between you and Xiao Xi?

400
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:06,259
No, things are not like you think!

401
00:24:06,259 --> 00:24:08,459
Let me tell you, Xiao Xi is my best friend.

402
00:24:08,459 --> 00:24:10,580
If you dare to bully her, I will make you pay.

403
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,239
Who is bullying whom?

404
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,100
Luo Xiao Xi is the one who's bulldozing me!

405
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,079
I am innocent.

406

Jian'an feels unwell.

407

She needs to go back and get some rest.

408

- Be nice to Xiao Xi.
- I-I...

409

Drink more brown sugar water, Jian'an!

410
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,459
Okay.

411

Jiang Shao Kai.

412
00:24:37,839 --> 00:24:41,239
I want to talk to you. Come here.

413
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,201
Hey, Xiao Xi! I'm here.

414
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:58,499
You're late again.

415
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:00,839
I've ordered something for you. It's a latte, sugar-free.

416
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:03,720
You know me best. Finger hearts.

417
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,880
Of course.

418
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:11,939
How is it going between you and Jiang Shao Kai?

419
00:25:13,079 --> 00:25:15,559
There's nothing between us. Don't talk nonsense.

420
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:18,200
I think Jiang Shao Kai is a nice person.

421
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,079
He just looks like a womanizer.

422
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:25,319
Su Jian'an, when did you go blind?

423
00:25:25,319 --> 00:25:26,760
Look.

424
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,980
How did the three of us become good friends?

425

- Who is a vagrant?
- You are a scourge!

426
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,780
-You are the scourge!
- You are!

427
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,219
- Your whole family is filled with scourges!
- You are the scourge!

428
00:25:36,219 --> 00:25:37,940
- Say it again!
- "Again!"

429
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,140
Say it again!

430
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:42,019
Luo Xiao Xi, why do you antagonize me all the time?

431
00:25:42,019 --> 00:25:44,320
You can't eat now! I won't let you.

432

- Hey!
- What?

How dare you!

It hurts! Stop! I'm sorry!

435
00:26:00,499 --> 00:26:02,580
But Jiang Shao Kai just loves playing around too much.

436
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:04,939
No one can subdue him.

437
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:08,800
Him? He is just a coward in front of me.

438
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:17,359
Su Jian'an! How much money did Jiang Shao Kai give you?

439

I will double it!

My dad must have some tricks up his sleeve again.

463

Honestly, I don't get you. What's so bad about being the Lingerie Queen?

Why are you so against it?

Yes.

474
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:51,125
I told her to come home and discuss the celebration with me.

475
00:27:51,125 --> 00:27:55,650
She keeps rejecting me. She hung up before I could finish.

Besides, even though Bo Yan cleared up the rumors,

I am still a bit worried.

478
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:07,360
I told you. Once you marry off your daughter, it's like you've lost her.

479
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,259
It means she is doing well in the Lu family.

Why don't we tell her to come back for the celebration this year?

Yuan Yuan needs to focus on her studies.

00:29:10,419 --> 00:29:12,119
- Jian'an.
- Yes?

496
00:29:12,119 --> 00:29:13,919
Time to take your medicine.

497
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:15,860
I don't want it.

498
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:18,359
It's so bitter.

499
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,400
It's so bitter!

500
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,100
Where's the candy?

501
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:47,500
Good girl.

502
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,560
By the way, Jian'an,

503
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:53,225
Dad called me this afternoon.

504
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:55,758
He wants us to go home and discuss the anniversary celebration.

505
00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:57,459
- Did you say yes?
- Yes.

506
00:29:57,459 --> 00:29:59,540
Why did you agree?

507
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,160
It's a good opportunity.

508
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,560
Your dad suspected us last time.

509
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:08,079
We can prove that I am the Su family's son-in-law with this opportunity.

510
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,858
That's very reasonable, right?

511
00:30:09,858 --> 00:30:11,100
I won't go back.

512
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,400
You can go without me.

513
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,119
My dad definitely won't give up.

514
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:16,200
Do I seriously have to go back to be the Lingerie Queen?

515
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,000
Don't you want to go?

516
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,800
Okay.

517
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,758
But it's such an important celebration.

518
00:30:24,759 --> 00:30:29,875
If you don't show up, Dad will be very sad.

519
00:30:30,739 --> 00:30:32,339
Jian'an.

520
00:30:32,339 --> 00:30:35,180
He is your father who gave you life and raised you.

521
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:38,750
He's just showing his love for you to the best of his ability in his own way.

522
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:40,739
Maybe you don't like it,

523
00:30:40,739 --> 00:30:43,558
but no matter what, I believe

524
00:30:43,558 --> 00:30:45,350
you are more important than anyone else

525
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:48,301
in your dad's heart.

526
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:53,400
Teacher Yang, this is our latest lingerie.

527
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,425
We used the best materials.

528
00:30:55,425 --> 00:30:58,639
Your figure will definitely look better with this.

529
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,899
I will teach Jian'an well, but there's no need for any gifts.

530
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:02,940
I have still have a class. I'll get going now.

531
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,320
Teacher Yang, it's just a little gift!

532
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,500
Dad!

533
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,719
This is so embarrassing!

534
00:31:10,219 --> 00:31:12,460
Lingerie Queen!

535
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:18,758
I know.

536
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:20,559
Jian'an,

537
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:25,259
some problems can't be solved if you just keep ignoring them.

538
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,459
You need to face them in the end.

539
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:33,480
Did they bully you again?

540
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,500
Are you here to bully me, too?

541
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,925
Why are you so sad about this?

542
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:47,000
Do you not know how to talk or fight back? If you are so submissive, they will just get worse!

543
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,318
What should I do then?

544
00:31:48,319 --> 00:31:50,980
Stand up straight and fight back!

545
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:56,100
Then you will realize they are just paper tigers!

546
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:01,159
They are coming.

547
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:05,150
Let's see if you'll become a general or a deserter this time.

548
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:06,740
Don't go.

549
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:12,438
Isn't this the Lingerie Queen? Why are you hiding here?

550
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:15,625
Does your dad make lingerie in your size?

551
00:32:15,625 --> 00:32:18,518
We prepared a set for the Lingerie Princess!

552
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:20,780
Is it big enough?

553
00:32:31,759 --> 00:32:33,358
What's wrong with lingerie?

554
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,719
So what if we sell lingerie?

555
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,079
Did we harm you in any way?

556
00:32:37,079 --> 00:32:39,418
Look, the Lingerie Princess has a temper!

557
00:32:39,418 --> 00:32:41,239
Don't you all wear undergarments?

558
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,939
Don't wear undergarments for the rest of your life if you're so amazing!

559
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:45,078
Su Jian'an is right.

560
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,598
Why are you mocking people for wearing lingerie?

561
00:32:46,599 --> 00:32:48,919
Yes, you guys are such bullies.

562
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:50,720
You...

563
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,518
Classmates who helped me today

564
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:56,825
will get a 50% discount at our Su's Beauty Group stores as long as you mention my name!

565
00:32:56,825 --> 00:32:57,959
As for you guys,

566
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,239
you are blacklisted from my family's stores from now on!

567
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,540
You!

568
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,539
Jian'an. Jian'an.

569
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:08,359
You were awesome.

570
00:33:10,825 --> 00:33:15,960
Whether you go or not, it's your decision to make.

571
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,380
Bo Yan.

572
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:25,280
I will go with you tomorrow.

573
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,320
Wait.

574
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,919
If Dad gives you anything tomorrow, don't accept it.

575
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,520
Okay?

576
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,180
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

577
