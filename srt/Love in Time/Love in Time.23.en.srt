332
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,660
I worked so hard.

333
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:07,459
My only wish is for him to come back to me again.

334
00:26:07,459 --> 00:26:08,679
Am I wrong?

335
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:13,800
Han Ruo Xi! Let go of your obsession.

336
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,139
You will lose yourself!

337
00:26:16,139 --> 00:26:19,079
You will hurt yourself! Don't you understand?

338
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:21,539
Don't get hurt again.

339
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:23,520
Let go?

340
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,340
Why should I?

341
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,840
I worked so hard.

342
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,659
Now, I'm a superstar.

343
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,579
Why does he still not love me?

344
00:26:35,579 --> 00:26:38,779
Why does he still love Su Jian'an?

345
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,539
I worked hard.

346
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,960
In the end, it has all been in vain.

347
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:49,918
Why do I have to lose to her?

348
00:26:49,918 --> 00:26:52,140
Why?

349
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:58,839
Han Ruo Xi, did you really lose?

350
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,980
You were bullied when you were an extra.

351
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,399
Who helped you out?

352
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,700
You got hurt while filming.

353
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:16,959
Who took care of you?

354
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,820
You signed the contract with Lu's Media.

355
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,218
You became a leading actress.

356
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:23,080
Who did all of that for you?

357
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,959
Was it Lu Bo Yan?

358
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,759
You can only see Lu Bo Yan!

359
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:33,658
Did you ever notice? Me!

360
00:27:33,658 --> 00:27:36,820
Have you ever noticed me, Shen Yue Chuan?

361
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:52,499
Ruo Xi.

362
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:59,599
Just let nature take its course.

363
00:27:59,599 --> 00:28:04,299
I believe that Han Ruo Xi is still kind,

364
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:07,825
diligent, and optimistic.

365
00:28:07,825 --> 00:28:12,550
One day, she will open her heart again.

366
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,340
She will come back.

367
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,380
I believe that.

368
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,620
I will wait.

369
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,080
I will wait till that day.

370
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,079
Yue Chuan. I don't deserve your love.

371
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:42,840
Ruo Xi.

372
00:28:44,275 --> 00:28:49,519
You still have me.

373
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:55,639
I, Shen Yue Chuan, will always be with you.

374
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:56,100
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫
