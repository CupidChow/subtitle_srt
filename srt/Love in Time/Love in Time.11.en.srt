Actually, it's not that big.

203
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,159
I don't like calling you Mrs. Lu.

I will keep calling you "Sister Jian'an."

we bought this chair together?

Back then, the company had just secured a big investment,

You also tied my shoes in public.

We have such a good relationship!

222

Do you even pay attention to my "place"?

223
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:10,340
That was all for the company's publicity.

She is nothing compared to me!

It's a fake marriage, isn't it?

What's wrong with you?

331
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:00,796
It's surprise, not fright, okay?

332
00:29:00,796 --> 00:29:02,760
Director, I'm sorry!

333
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:06,139
Can't you do it? I told you it should be surprise!

334
00:29:06,139 --> 00:29:08,360
- I will send the next one in!
- No, no, no need.

335
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:11,639
- I can do this.
- All right.

336
00:29:11,639 --> 00:29:14,319
Ready... Action!

337
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,380
This tastes so good!

338
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,439
Would you like a piece?

339
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:34,020
Cut!

340
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,879
Come on, no one is going to like that!

341
00:29:36,879 --> 00:29:39,818
Forget it. Can you do any other expressions?

342
00:29:39,818 --> 00:29:43,049
Yes, Director! Whatever you want!

343
00:29:43,049 --> 00:29:44,759
I want a suggestive one!

344
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,360
All right!

345
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,098
This smells so good! Would you like a piece?

346
00:29:52,098 --> 00:29:53,540
Meow!

347
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,420
Be sexy!

348
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:05,440
This smells so good. Would you like a piece?

349
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:10,220
Excited!

350
00:30:11,359 --> 00:30:14,239
Oh my gosh! This durian is so fragrant and sweet!

351
00:30:14,239 --> 00:30:16,398
Would you like a piece? Buy it!

352
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:19,820
A touch of emotion.

353
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:32,000
This is so delicious!

354
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,500
Would you like a piece?

355
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,120
Cut!

356
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,078
Could you... Could you be happy?

357
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:48,600
This durian is so delicious!

358
00:30:49,499 --> 00:30:52,259
Would you like a piece?

359
00:30:57,199 --> 00:30:59,099
Cut!

360
00:30:59,099 --> 00:31:02,480
- Director, I think this is enough.
- What?

361
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:05,520
Who are you? Are you the director or am I?

362
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,380
This is none of your business! You're just an assistant so shut up!

363
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,800
- No, no!
- I...

364
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,499
Director, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

365
00:31:10,499 --> 00:31:12,170
He doesn't understand this.

366
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,150
Forget it. You are not suitable for this. Go now.

367
00:31:14,150 --> 00:31:17,978
No, Director. Give me another chance. I promise—

368
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,800
- Go!
- Are you okay?

369
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:39,160
That was so disgusting! They are perverts.

370
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,575
Why did you push yourself so hard?

371
00:31:41,575 --> 00:31:44,699
That's none of your business! Mind your own matters!

372
00:31:44,699 --> 00:31:47,458
They would have hired me if it wouldn't have been for you!

373
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:48,659
Are you sick?

374
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:51,335
Couldn't you tell that it was a prank?

375
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:56,518
- It's none of your business!
- It is my business!

376
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:06,679
Call me next time before you go to an audition.

377
00:32:06,679 --> 00:32:08,480
Goodbye.

378
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,580
[Bathroom]

379
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,919
Jian'an! Don't worry about all that nonsense.

380
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,918
Just comfortably be Mrs. Lu, okay?

381
00:32:23,918 --> 00:32:26,675
You don't need to make a living, and you can publish whatever you want so it's great!

382
00:32:26,675 --> 00:32:29,739
No! That's something only a mistress would do!

383
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,519
No, it isn't!

384
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,039
It's love!

385
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,139
And you are Mrs. Lu.

386
00:32:36,139 --> 00:32:37,558
No, Mrs. Lu!

387
00:32:37,558 --> 00:32:41,558
When the contract expires, you will still have to write novels.

388
00:32:41,558 --> 00:32:45,019
Su Jian'an, you need to be independent!

389
00:32:45,019 --> 00:32:47,339
Why is Su Jian'an showing off so much?

390
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:49,139
We even need to study her novels!

391
00:32:49,139 --> 00:32:50,558
It's ridiculous!

392
00:32:50,558 --> 00:32:52,819
She just sold her privacy.

393
00:32:52,819 --> 00:32:55,638
She's just selling off her identity.

394
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:57,579
If we had CEOs as husbands,

395
00:32:57,579 --> 00:32:59,540
we would have sweeter novels than hers.

396
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,039
I have no idea why Lu Bo Yan chose her.

397
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:03,619
She is nothing special!

398
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:07,179
Yes. Of course, she is no better than us.

399
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:12,318
Don't evil characters watch TV nowadays?

400
00:33:12,318 --> 00:33:15,040
They don't even know how to find a secret place.

401
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:32,478
- Mrs. Lu, are you ready?
- Yes, I'm ready.

402
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,401
Mrs. Lu, many people think your novel is about

403
00:33:35,401 --> 00:33:37,950
what happened between you and your husband.

404
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,679
Is that the case?

405
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:40,980
Not entirely.

406
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,999
How is your relationship with President Lu?

407
00:33:43,999 --> 00:33:47,200
That has nothing to do with my novel now, does it?

408
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,058
Just for reference, you are childhood sweethearts, aren't you?

409
00:33:51,058 --> 00:33:54,799
Is the third wheel in the novel the popular star, Han Ruo Xi?

410
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:58,949
Rumor says that Han Ruo Xi had many disputes with you for quite a long time. Is that true?

411
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:01,959
How do you defend your marriage?

412
00:34:01,959 --> 00:34:06,439
Sorry, I do not wish to comment.

413
00:34:07,019 --> 00:34:08,859
Mrs. Lu!

414
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:23,679
[What "sweet novel"?]

415
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,218
[She's just exposing her private life to attract attention!]

416
00:34:26,218 --> 00:34:28,239
Why is Su Jian'an showing off so much?

417
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,119
We even need to study her novels!

418
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,578
It's ridiculous!

419
00:34:31,578 --> 00:34:34,120
She just sold her privacy.

420
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:39,938
[Indeed, so sweet. It's the same routine, nothing new.]

421
00:34:39,938 --> 00:34:41,759
[Every time the heroine encounters difficulties,]

422
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:43,398
[she has to ask for the hero's help.]

423
00:34:43,398 --> 00:34:44,719
[What a Mary Sue (unrealistically flawless) novel!]

424
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:46,920
You underestimate President Lu!

425
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:55,259
[Who would pay attention to her if it wasn't for Lu Bo Yan?]

426
00:35:00,125 --> 00:35:03,238
Your novel wouldn't be so popular without President Lu!

427
00:35:03,238 --> 00:35:07,578
If your name wasn't Mrs. Lu, I wouldn't have helped you so much!

428
00:35:07,578 --> 00:35:10,358
Without Lu Bo Yan, do you think you could write sweet novels?

429
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,918
Mrs. Lu, President Lu ordered so many clothes for you.

430
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:16,440
I really doubt you can wear them all!

431
00:35:19,439 --> 00:35:21,339
Jian'an, I mean, Mrs. Lu,

432
00:35:21,339 --> 00:35:23,619
Mrs. Lu!

433
00:35:23,619 --> 00:35:25,460
Mrs. Lu!

434
00:35:27,319 --> 00:35:31,598
First I was Lingerie Queen, and now I am Mrs. Lu.

435
00:35:31,598 --> 00:35:34,239
When can I be myself?

436
00:35:35,739 --> 00:35:38,660
