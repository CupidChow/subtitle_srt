[Episode 5]

13
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,939
How are you feeling now?

14
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,280
Fine.

15
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:29,580
I'll go answer the door.

16
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:39,299
Are you Han Ruo Xi?

17
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,339
- What are you doing here?
- I-I...

18
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:42,859
Bo Yan!

19
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,739
Bo Yan.

20
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:50,319
What is she doing in your house?

21
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,100
D*mn it.

22
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:56,180
I can't let Han Ruo Xi know about this.

23
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,279
Since you are here,

24
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:02,420
I need to do a little introduction.

25
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,479
- This is my—
- Cousin!

26
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:05,759
Distant cousin.

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,679
I'm staying here for a little while. Right?

28
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,519
Brother Bo Yan.

29
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,280
Your cousin?

30
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,875
Yue Chuan told me she is an online writer. Is that right?

31
00:02:16,875 --> 00:02:19,600
Yes. I'm just an online novel writer.

32
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:22,639
I am his cousin as well as a writer.

33
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,559
She is not my cousin. She is—

34
00:02:30,559 --> 00:02:34,874
Brother Bo. You don't recognize me just because

35
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:36,995
I told Aunt to let you play with me for a day, right?

36
00:02:36,995 --> 00:02:39,439
Don't be angry.

37
00:02:43,925 --> 00:02:47,918
No wonder, she turned out to be your cousin.

38
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,038
Do you know what?

39
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:53,150
No one could come to the house except me and Aunt Tang.

40
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,878
You look better in person than in the pictures.

41
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,079
No wonder you have so many fans.

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,280
Thank you.

43
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,079
Usually, Bo Yan is very busy.

44
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,700
If you want to play, tell me.

45
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,599
I can take you out to play.

46
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,599
All right.

47
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:09,240
Bo Yan, I bought you two kinds of medicine.

48
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,679
You are so careless!

49
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,478
You know you have a weak stomach.

50
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:14,359
You even ate spicy food.

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,638
Cousin, she is so considerate.

52
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,038
She brings you medicine in the middle of the night.

53
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:19,959
Look how sensible your cousin is.

54
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,978
Come now. Take the medicine.

55
00:03:20,978 --> 00:03:22,300
Stop!

56
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,799
It's not work time.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,780
You don't need to do this.

58
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:32,379
It's because I care about you.

59
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:36,440
Cousin, how can you talk to Miss Han like this?

60
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,499
I wanted to make you a celebrity as soon as possible

61
00:03:39,499 --> 00:03:41,239
so I supported you with every resource.

62
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,799
And I have told you over and over again,

63
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,519
don't confuse personal life with work.

64
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,799
Did you forget?

65
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,379
Why are they arguing in front of me?

66
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,239
Am I a third wheel?

67
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,499
Cousin. Miss Han.

68
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,419
I will go back to my room now.

69
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:57,879
Wait.

70
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,060
It's late.

71
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:04,920
I want to go to sleep with my cousin now.

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,960
Together! What?

73
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,878
No.

74
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,539
It's just about our childhood.

75
00:04:10,539 --> 00:04:12,880
We sleep in separate rooms now.

76
00:04:15,619 --> 00:04:17,419
Fine.

77
00:04:17,419 --> 00:04:19,080
Your stomach aches.

78
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:20,398
Go to bed early.

79
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,099
I need to work tomorrow.

80
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,999
I have to go now.

81
00:04:23,999 --> 00:04:25,679
Remember to take some medicine.

82
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,320
Han Ruo Xi.

83
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,725
I hope that you will just focus on work.

84
00:04:31,725 --> 00:04:33,159
Understand, okay?

85
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,219
Excuse me.

86
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,379
When did I become your cousin?

87
00:05:03,379 --> 00:05:06,520
If I had told her the truth, do you think it would be over this soon?

88
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,660
You are my legal wife,

89
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,420
not my cousin.

90
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,979
Because she is an outsider.

91
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,060
Can't you just cooperate with me?

92
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,660
President Lu.

93
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,840
Take your medicine.

94
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,860
There's no need.

95
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,940
You need to take your medicine.

96
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,259
What should I do?

97
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,700
Madam,

98
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,119
President Lu has an upset stomach,

99
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,880
but he still doesn't take his medicine.

100
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,580
I can't do anything about it.

101
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,660
I understand, Uncle Xu.

102
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,880
Come in.

103
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,239
Here is some jujube and lotus seed porridge for you.

104
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,419
It's good for your stomach.

105
00:06:31,419 --> 00:06:33,319
Here now. Eat some.

106
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:34,599
It's my chronic illness.

107
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,300
It will be okay soon.

108
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,759
Just eat the porridge.

109
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,339
I could eat it,

110
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,759
but I would like to know one thing.

111
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:45,820
Are you my cousin caring about your cousin

112
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:48,739
or is this the love of a wife toward her husband?

113
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:50,819
Do you need a reason, even to eat this porridge?

114
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,420
Of course, I do.

115
00:06:54,219 --> 00:06:57,739
I think your stomach aches, because of being with me.

116
00:06:57,739 --> 00:06:59,839
I feel sorry for that.

117
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,179
It's friendship between old classmates.

118
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,620
Here it is. Come on.

119
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,259
Eat it now.

120
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,520
How does it taste?

121
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,739
Do you like it?

122
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,419
So you don't like it?

123
00:07:33,099 --> 00:07:34,719
That's impossible.

124
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,340
Let me try it.

125
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:41,299
It's so hot! Hot! Oh!

126
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
So foolish.

127
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,160
Just drink that later.

128
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:05,739
Come on. Stick out your tongue.

129
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,060
What are you looking at?

130
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,119
Spray it now.

131
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:25,878
Are you ready for the spray?

132
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,579
It might be painful.

133
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,220
Be gentle.

134
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:51,020
Lu Bo Yan, let go of me.

135
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,699
- My stomach hurts. Just don't move.
- What?

136
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,479
Lu Bo Yan. Lu Bo Yan, are you okay?

137
00:08:58,479 --> 00:09:01,140
- Do you need to go to the hospital?
- No need.

138
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,018
Get up. I will take you to the hospital.

139
00:09:05,018 --> 00:09:08,220
Lu Bo Yan. Lu Bo Yan.

140
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:12,320
- Uncle Xu! Uncle Xu!
- Coming! Coming!

141
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,399
Take Lu Bo Yan to the hospital now.

142
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:19,840
- His stomach hurts again. Hurry.
- O-O-Oh, yes, yes.

143
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,740
Hello. What? Square dancing?

144
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:24,339
Okay, okay, for sure then.

145
00:09:24,339 --> 00:09:25,859
- Uncle Xu, where are you going?
- I'm on my way.

146
00:09:25,859 --> 00:09:27,299
- Wait over there for me.
- Uncle Xu!

147
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:30,198
- Wait for me.
- Uncle Xu. Hey!

148
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,800
Lu Bo Yan. Get up. Hey there!

149
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,040
Lu Bo Yan.

150
00:09:47,939 --> 00:09:49,539
Mrs. Lu.

151
00:09:49,539 --> 00:09:50,938
Where are you going?

152
00:09:50,938 --> 00:09:53,399
It's nothing. Don't mind me. I have to go now.

153
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,158
Breakfast is ready. You should have breakfast first.

154
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:58,540
- There's no need, no need.
- Where are you going?

155
00:10:00,259 --> 00:10:01,959
T-To work.

156
00:10:01,959 --> 00:10:05,459
- Uncle Xu prepared breakfast. You should eat breakfast first.
- Okay.

157
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,220
- Jian'an.
- Yes?

158
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:29,200
Is your tongue... better now?

159
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,380
Let me take a look.

160
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:41,499
There's no need.

161
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:44,278
It's not okay. You need some medicine.

162
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,300
All right, all right.

163
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,500
Mrs. Lu.

164
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,578
I've been cooking the porridge all morning.

165
00:10:56,578 --> 00:10:58,500
Have more if you like it.

166
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,899
And these are your favorite steamed dumplings.

167
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:03,458
Uncle Xu, how do you know I love steamed dumplings?

168
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:05,359
It's President Lu's...

169
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,740
As long as you like it.

170
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,700
Thank you, Uncle Xu.

171
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,710
[Sun Ge responds to criticism and protects the rights of athletes.]

172
00:11:34,719 --> 00:11:38,019
Jian'an. Are you free tomorrow night?
[President Lu started a new relationship with a girl in a maid's outfit.]

173
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:41,000
Look. Your news.
[President Lu started a new relationship with a girl in a maid's outfit.]

174
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,179
According to sources, President Lu Bo Yan...

175
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,359
It's also your news, right?

176
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,919
President Lu started a new relationship with a girl in a maid's outfit.

177
00:11:49,919 --> 00:11:53,139
They were seen while shopping in Yida Mall.

178
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:55,420
As we can see, they are very intimate.

179
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,979
Lu Bo Yan has been in love with actress Han Ruo Xi for many years,

180
00:11:58,979 --> 00:12:01,499
but they still haven't gotten married.

181
00:12:01,499 --> 00:12:06,050
The intervention of the maid girl makes it more confusing.

182
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:10,940
For more information on this matter, please keep paying attention to Lan Guo's report.

183
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:13,979
She thinks I am a mistress, right?

184
00:12:13,979 --> 00:12:15,900
What's wrong? Do you care about that?

185
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,419
Of course! You don't know how troublesome it is!

186
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:22,099
I will be the public enemy of women in the city.

187
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:25,619
- So what?
- Of course, you don't care!

188
00:12:34,819 --> 00:12:37,620
Fortunately, they can't see my face.

189
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,178
You were saying... What is there tomorrow night?

190
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:43,740
It's nothing. Just eat.

191
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:46,740
I'm not in the mood to eat now.

192
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,480
- I can take you to work now.
- No, no, no.

193
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,530
We had better keep our distance now.

194
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,680
Wait.

195
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,719
No, I can walk by myself.

196
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,499
Get in the car.

197
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:14,858
Actually, I can go to the company by myself. You don't need to take me.

198
00:14:14,858 --> 00:14:16,938
Besides, there are rumors about us.

199
00:14:16,938 --> 00:14:21,599
If someone sees us, it will cause a lot of trouble. Right?

200
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:28,438
Lu Bo Yan. You are so familiar with the media.

201
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:32,620
You should tell the media to take down the reports.

202
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:35,400
Are you really that worried about being misunderstood?

203
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,420
What? Do you want to be exposed?

204
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,878
Don't do it.

205
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:41,819
Han Ruo Xi has very many fans. If I'm exposed, and they take it out on me, there's nothing I can do.

206
00:14:41,819 --> 00:14:45,479
In the future, I won't be able to quietly write novels anymore.

207
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:48,620
So writing novels is that important to you?

208
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:52,840
Of course, it is. I will publish my novel in the future.

209
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,939
I will get a lot of readers.

210
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,519
You are busy every day.

211
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:04,939
If our relationship gets exposed, you'll need to create the illusion of being a good husband.

212
00:15:04,939 --> 00:15:06,740
It will be very tiring.

213
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:10,739
Moreover, you and Han Ruo Xi are a match made in Heaven and Earth.

214
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:14,800
It would be a pity if you would break up with each other.

215
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,080
You worry so much about others.

216
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:19,878
What's more, we have an agreement.

217
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:23,699
We will only be husband and wife for one year.

218
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,899
Hey! What are you doing?

219
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,879
- Get out of the car.
- What?

220
00:15:31,879 --> 00:15:34,620
At least drop me off at a place where I can take a taxi.

221
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,019
You are so picky.

222
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:39,199
You don't want to be discovered, right?

223
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,759
Get out of my car.

224
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,720
All right!

225
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:50,179
You...

226
00:15:57,539 --> 00:16:01,118
Gosh. I am going to be late for the meeting.

227
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:09,478
Su Jian'an. What are you doing?

228
00:16:09,478 --> 00:16:11,678
Running to work.

229
00:16:11,678 --> 00:16:14,859
Running to work? What a healthy way to get there.

230
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:17,280
Are you going to have a baby (so you're getting healthy)?

231
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,579
Don't make fun of me.

232
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:23,958
You acted so ridiculously yesterday leaving me there alone.

233
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:26,920
It's my fault. I didn't expect him to come.

234
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,879
Well, I will invite you to lunch today as compensation.

235
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:32,700
- Deal.
- Ding (seal the deal)!

236
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:37,540
What is it? Lack of inspiration again?

237
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:41,178
Someone took a picture of me and Lu Bo Yan in the mall yesterday.

238
00:16:41,178 --> 00:16:42,760
What should you do?

239
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,719
If it gets exposed, you two will officially be considered a couple.

240
00:16:46,719 --> 00:16:49,979
So I told him to find a way out.

241
00:16:49,979 --> 00:16:51,439
I just knew it.

242
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:55,225
You won't fall in love with Lu Bo Yan because of me.

243
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:59,419
P*ss off (Get lost)! Drive.

244
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,700
President Lu, didn't you tell Miss Su we would pick her up after switching cars?

245
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,639
- Or—
- Don't be late.

246
00:17:30,151 --> 00:17:32,150
Miss Han. As I know, you are going to participate in

247
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,139
the strategy conference of Lu's Media this year, and as an ambassador,

248
00:17:35,139 --> 00:17:37,199
you received the invitation from President Lu, right?

249
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:40,518
Bo Yan has been my career and life partner these past years.

250
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,174
I've witnessed the development of Lu's Media all the way through.

251
00:17:43,174 --> 00:17:45,919
So it's reasonable that I received the invitation.

252
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,699
But today, a picture is circulating online.

253
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:51,758
Lu Bo Yan was dating a girl in a maid's costume at the mall.

254
00:17:51,758 --> 00:17:54,520
What's your opinion on this?

255
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:59,758
Lu's Media will engage in new emerging fields in the future.

256
00:17:59,758 --> 00:18:02,879
Bo Yan has been sensitive to the market trends.

257
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,999
As far as I know, he has some interest in some subcultural fields

258
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,978
so he needs to do some user market research.

259
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:14,158
But the picture does not look like some kind of ambiguous research.

260
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:17,899
So are there any problems between the two of you?

261
00:18:17,899 --> 00:18:20,518
Bo Yan told me about this.

262
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:22,639
We are on good terms now.

263
00:18:22,639 --> 00:18:25,379
You all know Bo Yan's talent

264
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:28,280
so some people will harbor evil ideas.

265
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,078
Thank you for your concern anyway.

266
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:34,700
After the interview, I have prepared a luncheon for you.

267
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,218
- Miss Han!
- Miss Han!

268
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:39,039
Thank you, Guys. You can go back now.

269
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:41,579
Sister Han.

270
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:45,080
Did President Lu mention the girl to you? Who is she?

271
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:47,139
One of his distant cousins.

272
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:49,860
Why didn't you explain that to the reporters?

273
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:51,959
I have known Bo Yan for so many years.

274
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:54,874
I never heard him mention any distant cousin.

275
00:18:54,874 --> 00:18:59,279
And in my view, they are not cousins.

276
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,079
What?

277
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,879
I will leave the reporters to you. I need to see Bo Yan now.

278
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:14,840
Oh, my gosh. What kind of woman is she?

279
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:17,479
She can take a man from Han Ruo Xi.

280
00:19:17,479 --> 00:19:19,399
She is so ignorant.

281
00:19:19,399 --> 00:19:23,919
I didn't expect Lu Bo Yan to like cosplay. It's very impressive.

282
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,800
- What are you doing?
- Look.

283
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,999
President Lu's affair. It's a hot topic now.

284
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:38,619
Jian'an, you are hot now. A maid's outfit, how awesome!

285
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:41,339
Stop the nonsense. Go away!

286
00:19:41,339 --> 00:19:44,899
What are you talking about? Let's have a meeting right now.

287
00:19:44,899 --> 00:19:48,619
Does the manuscript fee get higher for you every day?

288
00:19:50,060 --> 00:19:52,240
Take a seat. Hurry!

289
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,818
Well, everyone is here now. Let's get started.

290
00:19:57,818 --> 00:20:01,819
Our Taoran Literature Network is in a stage of transformation now.

291
00:20:01,819 --> 00:20:05,719
I hope you can keep up with the market and our network.

292
00:20:05,719 --> 00:20:10,780
Now, I want to praise Su Jian'an.

293
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:15,250
The clicks on her new novel have reached

294
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:19,059
the top 20. And the response is great.

295
00:20:19,059 --> 00:20:21,120
Applause, everyone.

296
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,374
Great!

297
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,230
In the future, we will make commercial developments

298
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:30,120
such as animations for the excellent works.

299
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,570
- "Animations for the excellent works"?
- Yes.

300
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:35,820
- Jiang Shao Kai.
- Yes.

301
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,199
I will leave business partners to you.

302
00:20:39,199 --> 00:20:42,380
I'm leaving this especially to you so don't let me down!

303
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:44,699
Okay, I won't fail you!

304
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:46,149
Thank you.

305
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:50,199
Next, let's discuss the next novel's direction. All right.

306
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:51,700
President Lu.

307
00:20:52,699 --> 00:20:55,599
At 7:15 p.m., President Lu will introduce Miss Han Ruo Xi as

308
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:59,276
the image ambassador of this strategy conference.

309
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:04,479
As we can see, the left one is Miss Han's gown for tomorrow night,

310
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,700
and the right one is Miss Han's gown for the interview

311
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:12,325
with President Lu after the press conference.

312
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:16,239
That's all for today's meeting. Dismissed.

313
00:21:18,459 --> 00:21:20,759
President Lu.

314
00:21:20,759 --> 00:21:23,699
I am already in communication with the media, and I have spoken to most of them.

315
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,299
It will be no problem. I will go back to work now.

316
00:21:30,699 --> 00:21:34,259
Bo Yan. Did you see the news?

317
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,939
I am talking about this with the media. Don't worry.

318
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:38,140
To be frank,

319
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:43,130
your cousin has a negative impact on us and the company.

320
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,380
So what do you want?

321
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,140
I think you should let your cousin move out first.

322
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,738
I can rent an apartment for her.

323
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:56,150
If you live together, it will cause misunderstandings.

324
00:21:56,925 --> 00:21:59,959
This won't be good for Jian'an either.

325
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,600
This is my family business.

326
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:07,558
Gosh. Is your distant relative more important than our relationship?

327
00:22:07,558 --> 00:22:10,540
I think you should focus on the press conference.

328
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,760
I have work to do. Excuse me.

329
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,960
Cousin? It's not so simple.

330
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:31,000
Okay, that's all for today. The meeting is over. Dismissed.

331
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,600
Jiang Shao Kai.

332
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,240
Come here. Hurry, hurry!

333
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,919
Sister Jian'an, it's so great. I want to learn from you.

334
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:44,259
It's nothing. We can help each other in the future.

335
00:22:44,259 --> 00:22:46,275
I need to have lunch now.

336
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:51,119
I didn't expect it. You wrote suspense novels before. Now, you write romance.

337
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:52,318
That's just luck.

338
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,120
You've had many boyfriends, right?

339
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,919
I have no experience in this.

340
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,259
I need to study it for a long time.

341
00:23:00,259 --> 00:23:04,439
Shao Kai. Do you have time at noon? Let's talk about my new book.

342
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:07,000
I don't. I have an appointment with Jian'an,

343
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,638
and with something called "talent," which you just don't have.

344
00:23:11,638 --> 00:23:13,999
Come on, let's have lunch.

345
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,740
The same shoes.

346
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,460
It wouldn't be her, right?

347
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,640
Excuse me. Your dishes are all here.

348
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,999
Thank you.

349
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,800
Have a good meal.

350
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:44,860
Chen Xuan Xuan is a b*tch. Ignore her.
[President Lu started a new relationship with a girl in a maid's outfit.]

351
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,025
Ignore her.

352
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:51,900
Jian'an. I think Lu Bo Yan is really good to you.

353
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,858
He went shopping with you and took pictures with you.

354
00:23:54,858 --> 00:23:59,458
It's not pretense. I think he is serious.

355
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,879
Don't talk nonsense. It's not true.

356
00:24:02,879 --> 00:24:05,839
He really wants to delete it. Otherwise, he won't be able to explain it to Han Ruo Xi.

357
00:24:05,839 --> 00:24:07,558
I don't think so.

358
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:11,650
You won't be able to hide your marriage for too long.

359
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,278
You better close your mouth. Eat.

360
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,699
I have to work now. Call me if you need help.

361
00:24:22,699 --> 00:24:24,080
Okay.

362
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,730
[Unpleasant]

363
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,939
Hello, Lu Bo Yan.

364
00:24:38,939 --> 00:24:41,798
I find there are fewer negative comments now.

365
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,499
Thank you.

366
00:24:43,499 --> 00:24:45,359
As you wish.

367
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,860
This Lu Bo Yan...

368
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,959
It's so unbelievable.

369
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,259
She could seduce the president of Lu's Media.

370
00:25:12,039 --> 00:25:14,279
Sister Han, look.

371
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,559
God is helping me.

372
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,639
I will add more fuel to the fire.

373
00:25:28,639 --> 00:25:32,120
I want to see how long you can stay in Lu's house.

374
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:47,359
- Hello.
- B*tch. How shameless!

375
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:50,898
- You seduced Lu Bo Yan! Lu Bo Yan belongs to my Han Ruo Xi—
- Are you sick (insane)?

376
00:25:50,898 --> 00:25:52,719
Ridiculous.

377
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:56,019
- What happened?
- Nothing.

378
00:25:56,019 --> 00:25:57,619
Well, someone left you a gift.

379
00:25:57,619 --> 00:25:59,699
- Who?
- No idea.

380
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:02,839
I think it's a surprise from Lu Bo Yan.

381
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,480
Who did it?

382
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:20,059
It's fake.

383
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:36,460
How strange.

384
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:39,300
The negative comments decreased so why...

385
00:26:42,970 --> 00:26:45,770
[Her name is Su Jian'an, an online writer at Taoran Literature Network.]

386
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,960
Oh, no.

387
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,900
Do you need me to take you back?

388
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:10,758
There's no need. We shouldn't be seen by gossip magazine reporters.

389
00:27:10,758 --> 00:27:12,919
They would spread rumors again.

390
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:15,399
What are you doing?

391
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,938
Are you all idling here?

392
00:27:17,938 --> 00:27:20,200
This weekend, all of you need to work.

393
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,979
Back to work!

394
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:28,538
Jian'an, you should go home and get some more rest.

395
00:27:28,538 --> 00:27:31,520
Don't let the gossip affect your creation.

396
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,720
Thank you, President.

397
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:37,300
Don't think too much.

398
00:27:38,259 --> 00:27:40,059
I'm leaving now.

399
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,080
Gosh.

400
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:38,460
Hello. The subscriber you dialed turned off the phone. Sorry–

401
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:43,639
President Lu, tomorrow night's press conference is ready.

402
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:47,774
By then, you and Miss Han Ruo Xi will show up in the center of the stage.

403
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,640
President Lu.

404
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:02,060
Jiang Shao Kai!

405
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:04,618
- Where is Su Jian'an?
- She... What are you doing here?

406
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,159
I am asking you where Su Jian'an is!

407
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,680
She was in a bad mood so she went home.

408
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,519
Han Ruo Xi's fans want to surround her. We have to find her right away!

409
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:12,919
- Otherwise, she will be in danger! Come on.
- Wait, wait.

410
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:16,059
Breaking news. Lu Bo Yan, President of Lu's Media,

411
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:18,418
ended his long-term relationship with Han Ruo Xi.

412
00:29:18,418 --> 00:29:21,698
He is having an affair with non-famous, female online writer Su Jian'an.

413
00:29:21,698 --> 00:29:25,339
Lu Bo Yan has been the center of attention in recent years.

414
00:29:25,339 --> 00:29:26,598
- Just a few years...
- Hey.

415
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,318
What would she look like?

416
00:29:28,319 --> 00:29:29,758
Why would President Lu love her?

417
00:29:29,759 --> 00:29:31,979
He even forgot his superstar.

418
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,479
Have you seen the photo?

419
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,758
It's cosplay, maid seduction.

420
00:29:35,758 --> 00:29:38,819
Young people are so ridiculous nowadays.

421
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:41,639
Yes. It's very ridiculous.

422
00:29:41,639 --> 00:29:46,098
Yes. Girl, you are nice and quiet.

423
00:29:46,098 --> 00:29:47,700
Don't learn from them, okay?

424
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,598
They have fallen in love.

425
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:52,380
Days ago, Su Jian'an was dressed in cosplay...

426
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,040
What are they doing? They are blocking the way.

427
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:57,358
They behaved intimately...

428
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:59,120
It's her. It's her.

429
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,079
- It's her.
- Go!

430
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,980
- Come out.
- Get out.

431
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,160
- Your friends?
- Open the door!

432
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,458
No way.

433
00:30:06,458 --> 00:30:08,519
Get out. Get out. Did you hear me?

434
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,119
- Get out!
- Hey!

435
00:30:10,119 --> 00:30:12,179
What are you doing? Don't bully that little girl.

436
00:30:12,179 --> 00:30:14,140
- Go!
- Look here!

437
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,879
- Driver!
- Do you know who we are?

438
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:20,439
You didn't introduce yourself. How would I know who you are?

439
00:30:20,439 --> 00:30:22,019
I need to go home.

440
00:30:22,019 --> 00:30:23,839
Where do you think you're going?

441
00:30:23,839 --> 00:30:25,479
You took my idol's man.

442
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,419
Do you still want to go home? How shameless!

443
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,120
You're disgusting! Shameless!

444
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,030
I'm warning you. Get out of the Lu Family now!

445
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:33,270
Get away from Lu Bo Yan. Did you hear me?

446
00:30:33,270 --> 00:30:35,960
Let me tell you, there is 24-hour, real-time monitoring here.

447
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,179
The police will come soon. You should go now.

448
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:41,920
I'll teach you a lesson. Five minutes will be enough.

449
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:49,160
- Lu Bo Yan!
- It's him.

450
00:30:50,119 --> 00:30:53,210
I'm the chairwoman of Han Ruo Xi's Global Fan Club in Taoran!

451
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:56,160
- We will protect you and Han Ruo Xi!
- What's going on? Stop this. Hey!

452
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:58,320
Go! Get out of here.

453
00:30:58,320 --> 00:30:59,898
Go, go. Go.

454
00:30:59,898 --> 00:31:03,339
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

455
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,620
Let's get in the car.

456
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:17,480
Succeeded.

457
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:19,800
I am late.

458
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,738
Jian'an got picked up by her husband.

459
00:31:22,738 --> 00:31:24,339
Why are you so unhappy?

460
00:31:24,339 --> 00:31:27,099
No one knows what will happen to Jian'an and Lu Bo Yan after the year has passed.

461
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:29,099
How do you know I have no chance?

462
00:31:29,099 --> 00:31:32,178
You have so many girls around you.

463
00:31:32,178 --> 00:31:33,999
It would be so strange if Jian'an would love you.

464
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,600
I'm telling you. If Su Jian'an would give me a clear answer,

465
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,100
I could break up with all those girls immediately.

466
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:46,160
Then I would really have to look at you differently.

467
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:53,000
How can ordinary people like you see through my pure heart?

468
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,880
Where do you want to go? I can give you a ride.

469
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,760
Go home.

470
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,379
How did you know I was under attack?

471
00:32:06,379 --> 00:32:08,280
Yue Chuan told me.

472
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,159
So you came to save me?

473
00:32:11,159 --> 00:32:12,819
I just dropped by.

474
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,339
Anyway, thank you.

475
00:32:26,475 --> 00:32:29,020
What should I do?

476
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:35,198
Lu Bo Yan, I think we should clarify our relationship.

477
00:32:39,259 --> 00:32:40,441
That's a good idea.

478
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:45,339
You should hold an exclusive interview to tell them we are cousins.

♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

486
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,700
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

487
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,410
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

488
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:40,160
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

489
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,930
♫ The signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

490
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,570
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

491
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:49,310
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

492
00:33:49,310 --> 00:33:52,420
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

493
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:58,250
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

494
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:01,920
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

495
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,710
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

496
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,420
♫ Warning all problems ♫

497
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,170
♫ To stay away from us ♫

498
00:34:09,170 --> 00:34:12,820
♫ No one can take my place ♫

499
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,630
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

500
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:19,730
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

501
00:34:19,730 --> 00:34:26,040
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
