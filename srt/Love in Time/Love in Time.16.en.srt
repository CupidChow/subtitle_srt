00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,920
I fear you still haven't forgiven me.

169
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:34,704
I'm afraid you might leave me.

170
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:39,180
Actually, at the broadcast station,

171
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:43,600
I only said... the first half.

172
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,400
What's the second half?

173
00:17:51,025 --> 00:17:52,340
No,

174
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,280
I want to tell you that complete sentence today.

175
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,440
No one wants to be friends with a fat girl,

176
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:05,118
but I, Lu Bo Yan,

177
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:07,159
want to!

178
00:18:07,159 --> 00:18:08,840
Su Jian'an,

179
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,259
I like you!

180
00:18:21,459 --> 00:18:26,235
No matter what, I will love you forever,

181
00:18:26,235 --> 00:18:27,879
Mrs. Lu.

182
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,099
What do you want? This is so mysterious.

183
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:09,699
What's your surprise?

184
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,859
Okay.

185
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,100
What does this mean?

186
00:19:19,279 --> 00:19:23,999
Mr. Lu and Mrs. Lu need to sleep in the same room.

187
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,679
And we pinky swore.

188
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,140
You said you would compensate me.

189
00:19:31,425 --> 00:19:34,625
I have waited for this moment for a long time.

190
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,859
- I-I need to go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

191
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:11,619
Su Jian'an, the day we have been waiting for has arrived!

192
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:13,278
President Lu is giving you a hint.

193
00:20:13,279 --> 00:20:15,840
Why are you still hesitating? Go and possess him!

194
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,799
No.

195
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,159
Girls should be reserved.

196
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,199
He just confessed.

197
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,179
Jian'an, you need to be patient.

198
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:22,518
That's ridiculous!

199
00:20:22,519 --> 00:20:24,278
Legally, they are husband and wife.

200
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:26,758
They need to fulfill their obligations.

201
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:28,758
It is the mission of mankind.

202
00:20:28,759 --> 00:20:31,239
The sense of mystery can remain only by being reserved.

203
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,639
Then you can make him more attracted to you forever.

204
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,900
And he will give his heart to you unconditionally.

205
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,118
You will get his body.

206
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,699
He will surrender to you forever.

207
00:20:40,699 --> 00:20:42,959
Anyway, you can't be an easy girl.

208
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,159
Look. She also can't resist President Lu's charisma.

209
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,979
Jian'an, just do it.

210
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,879
That's the spirit!

211
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:56,480

I'm fine.

Bo Yan.

230
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,299
Is he still afraid of the dark?

231
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,350
- Good morning.
- Yes. Where's Uncle Xu?

232
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,401
Uncle Xu went to attend his relative's wedding.

233
00:24:57,959 --> 00:25:00,259
What, his relative?

234
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:02,499
Did Uncle Xu ask for leave?

235
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:06,480
Jian'an, did you notice?

236
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,260
I have only a cup of coffee for my breakfast.

237
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,838
Are you going to starve to death while Uncle Xu is away?

238
00:25:12,839 --> 00:25:15,059
Say it, what do you want to eat?

239
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,659
I like whatever you make.

240
00:25:20,659 --> 00:25:22,559
Wait here.

241
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:25,919
No.

242
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,358
On second thought,

243
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:31,159
we should eat out.

244
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:33,400
Why you are doing this?

245
00:25:39,359 --> 00:25:41,599
Lu Bo Yan!

246
00:25:43,319 --> 00:25:46,559
You are forbidden from going into the kitchen.

247
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:47,879
That is my kitchen.

248
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,220
You just can't enter it!

249
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,440
Oh, by the way, when will Uncle Xu be back?

250
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,618
- In three or four days.
- "In three or four days"?

251
00:25:56,618 --> 00:25:58,679
I'm starting to miss him already.

252
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,179
He is the reason why you were able to be Golden CEO Lu.

253
00:26:01,179 --> 00:26:03,140
You need to thank Uncle Xu.

There is nothing I can't do in this world.

255

If there is, it is only temporary.

256
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:14,240
Then... why are you afraid of the dark?

257
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:17,640
Can you tell me?

258
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,119
Let's not talk about me.

259
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:23,040
Well, are you still writing your novel?

260
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,278
I want to summarize what I learned in the crew.

261
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:31,320
I will start writing novels in a few days.

262
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,798
I can talk to the president.

263
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,239
Are you doing this again?

264
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:37,860
- I can talk to President Du myself.
- Okay.

265
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,900
Bo Yan,

266
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,799
- about last night—
- Oh, right,

267
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:46,518
I just came back from the crew.

268
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:47,838
I have a lot to do.

269
00:26:47,839 --> 00:26:50,238
I need to go to work now, okay?

270
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,680
- Okay. Come back early.
- All right.

271
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:13,100
July 12.

272
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:15,300
That's Bo Yan's birthday.

273
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,280
- Actually, I came that day. I was just a little late.
- Why was Bo Yan late back then?

274
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,539
What happened?

275
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,640
Hello, Mom.

276
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,140
Bo Yan and I are back.

277
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:26,100
We want to see you.

278
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,519
Jian'an, I'm in France now.

279
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:33,300
Tomorrow, some sisters and I will go shopping on the Champs-Élysées (literally Elysian Fields in Paris, France).

280
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:36,219
What do you want? I can buy it for you.

281
00:27:36,219 --> 00:27:38,019
Thank you, Mom.

282
00:27:38,019 --> 00:27:40,038
I want to ask you

283
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:44,520
if you know, why is Bo Yan afraid of the dark?

284
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:49,619
It happened over ten years ago.

285
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,299
It is midnight here.

286
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:56,199
I am sleepy.

287
00:27:56,199 --> 00:27:59,840
I will tell you after I return. Okay?

288
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,420
Okay.

289
00:28:07,939 --> 00:28:10,300
He sleeps with the lights on,

290
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,080
afraid of the dark.

291
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,460

292
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,460

00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,499
Did you want to see me?

297
00:28:41,499 --> 00:28:43,249
Do you know Bo Yan's birthday?

298
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,179
Of course.

299
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:45,859
July 12, next Wednesday.

300
00:28:45,859 --> 00:28:48,100
However, President Lu never celebrates his birthday.

301
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,259
Does he never celebrate his birthday? Why not?

302
00:28:50,259 --> 00:28:54,182
I think it's because it's the anniversary of his father's death.

303
00:28:54,182 --> 00:28:57,099
President Lu is usually unhappy on that day.

304
00:28:57,099 --> 00:28:59,180
It is the anniversary of Uncle Lu's death.

305
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,240
Is it related to his achluophobia?

306
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,419
Do you know why Uncle Lu passed away?

307
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:07,979
President Lu has never mentioned it to me.

308
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:10,599
Miss Su, you can ask President Lu personally.

309
00:29:28,699 --> 00:29:31,119
We have reunited after so long.

310
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:34,299
I didn't have the chance to know you better.

Bo Yan,

312
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,859
I will help you remove the psychological cloud over you.

You will see the bright sun.

314
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:19,259
Bo Yan, I know you don't want to tell me,

315
00:30:19,259 --> 00:30:20,820
but as your wife,

316
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:23,060
I am really worried about you.

317
00:30:23,659 --> 00:30:28,220
The day we made an appointment thirteen years ago was July 12.

318
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,359
You were late that day.

319

320

Dad died that day, too.

321
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,340

322
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,800
you began to be afraid of the dark.

323
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,080
Something bad happened that day, right?

324

It is all over now.

325
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,650
What happened that day still has an impact on you, though.

326
00:31:03,650 --> 00:31:04,979
I looked into it.

327
00:31:04,979 --> 00:31:06,860
You have achluophobia,

328
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,040

00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:18,830
Yes, it was that day.

331
00:31:18,830 --> 00:31:21,460
What happened that day?

332
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,219
Bo Yan, just tell me.

00:31:23,219 --> 00:31:25,619
I really want to help you.

334
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:35,399
That day was the darkest day of my life.

335
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,139
I asked you to come here

336
00:31:37,139 --> 00:31:39,979
because I wanted to apologize to you.

337
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:42,350
But on my way,

338
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,550
I was kidnapped by my dad's business competitor.

339
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,119
I was locked in a rundown hut.

340
00:31:52,659 --> 00:31:56,375
You left before I got there.

341
00:31:56,375 --> 00:31:59,520
I only found the torn photo.

342
00:32:06,659 --> 00:32:11,239
That day, you thought I was making fun of you,

343
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,200
and you stopped being my friend.

344
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,900
On the same day,

345
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:22,719
my dad died of a heart attack.

346
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,719
In my life,

347
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,499
you two are very important to me.

348
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,950
But both of you... left me on the same day.

349
00:32:38,699 --> 00:32:41,459
Deep in my heart,

350
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:44,600
I always feel like

351
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,820
I will never get out of that dark room.

352
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,690
So did you and Mom leave Taoran

353
00:32:53,690 --> 00:32:56,370
because of this?

354
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:04,239
Bo Yan, it is all over now.

355
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:08,850
I believe that Dad doesn't want to see you like this.

356
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,420
We have to live on.

357
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,560
Do you know what?

358
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:19,739
In my heart, you never back down.

359
00:33:19,739 --> 00:33:22,100
You are very brave.

360
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,339
Allow me to help you overcome this, okay?

361
00:33:30,125 --> 00:33:33,190
Do you want us to sleep

362
00:33:33,190 --> 00:33:35,510
with the lights on every night?

363
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:43,080
Okay.

364
00:33:43,979 --> 00:33:45,979
Come, pinky swear.

365
00:33:54,939 --> 00:33:56,839
Let's work together.

366
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,459
What do you want?
[Starry Night]

367
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:22,799
This is my treatment.

368
00:34:22,799 --> 00:34:24,459
I will reward you if you can make it.

369
00:34:24,459 --> 00:34:26,159
- Will you reward me?
- Yes.

370
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,960
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

371
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,320
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

372
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,010
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

377
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,460

378
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:15,130
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

379
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,860
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

380
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,720

♫ To stay away from us ♫

389
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:50,530
♫ No one can take my place ♫

390
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,310
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

391
00:35:54,310 --> 00:35:57,490
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

392
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:02,990
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
