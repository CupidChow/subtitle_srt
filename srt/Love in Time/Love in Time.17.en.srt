This is my treatment.

15
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,559
I will reward you if you can make it.

16
00:01:24,559 --> 00:01:26,759
- Will you reward me?
- Yes.

17
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,380
Come on.

18
00:01:39,419 --> 00:01:41,579
Bo Yan, don't be afraid.

19
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:44,140
I'll start keeping time now.

20
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,680
No!

21
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,040
I can't do this.

22
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,239
Let's do this another way, okay?

23
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,200
Give it to me.

24

What new tricks have you planned for today?

45
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:01,039
Today, I will turn off all the lights.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,780
You better not do that.

47
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,620
I've been to see many psychologists,

48
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,139
but it was all in vain.

49
00:04:08,139 --> 00:04:10,540
Why? Are you giving up so easily?

This is not the Lu Bo Yan I know.

51
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,200
This is reverse psychology, isn't it?

00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,500
Sir. May I dance with you?

53

Let's get started.

54
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,939
Bo Yan. How are you feeling?

55
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,980
I'm fine.

56
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:04,720
Don't be afraid. I am here.

57
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:16,120
Look at me, Bo Yan.

58
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:34,999
According to my observations,

59
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:36,500
after all these days of treatment,

60
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,740
you have made obvious improvement, both physically and mentally.

61
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,175
Today you will face the final treatment.

62
00:06:43,175 --> 00:06:45,119
Are you confident?

63
00:06:49,459 --> 00:06:51,059
Of course.

64
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,359
Get ready.

65
00:06:55,359 --> 00:06:57,059
You can do this.

66
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,040
Okay.

67
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:02,479
Turn off the lights.

68
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:09,199
Bo Yan, there is nothing scary here.

69
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,975
I will turn off this flashlight.

70
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,120
Don't go!

71
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,300
Don't worry.

72
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,759
I will stay with you.

73
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,360
Okay?

74
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,640
Ready?

75
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,900
Okay.

76
00:07:30,579 --> 00:07:32,179
Wait!

77
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,220
Wait.

78
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,059
Okay. Come.

79
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,599
Bo Yan. Nothing can stop your heart.

80
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,799
You can do this!

81
00:07:59,799 --> 00:08:00,960
Jian'an!

82
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,339
You can defeat the darkness!

83
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,240
Jian'an?

84
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,540
Jian'an!

85
00:08:39,579 --> 00:08:41,060
Someone!

86
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,060
Help me!

87
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,219
Help!

88
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:46,259
Is there anyone who can help me?

89
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:47,300
Someone!

90
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,940
Don't be afraid. Take a deep breath.

91
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,259
Inhale.

92
00:08:51,259 --> 00:08:54,499
Exhale. Calm down.

93
00:08:54,499 --> 00:08:56,100
I can't do this.

94
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,119
Help me!

95
00:08:58,119 --> 00:09:01,400
Help, please untie me!

96
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,040
Bo Yan, listen to me.

97
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,500
There is no rope binding you at all.

98
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,680
You are free.

99
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,759
Nothing can restrain you or trap you,

100
00:09:13,759 --> 00:09:16,060
except your own heart.

101
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:20,899
I believe you can overcome this.

102
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:22,660
Because to me,

103
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,475
you have been the strongest and bravest ever since we were children!

104
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,920
Nothing can stop you.

105
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:35,640
Bo Yan. The dark house ceased to exist a long time ago.

106
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,820
Bo Yan. Follow my voice and you will find me.

107
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,060
I have waited for you for a long time.

108
00:10:52,499 --> 00:10:53,820
Believe in yourself!

109
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,700
You can make it!

110
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,140
You told me that escaping doesn't solve any problems.

111
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,580
We need to face them with courage.

112
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,760
Bo Yan? Are you listening?

113
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,940
Bo Yan? Bo Yan!

114
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,759
Where are you?

115
00:11:20,679 --> 00:11:22,400
I found you!

116
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,459
You did it.

117
00:11:27,559 --> 00:11:29,300
You did it!

118
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:44,920
Good morning, Yue Chuan.

119
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,180
President Lu, you are so early today.

120
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,200
You are also in a good mood.

121
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,999
- Am I?
- Yes.

122
00:11:53,999 --> 00:11:56,819
Is it because of Miss Su?

123
00:11:58,099 --> 00:11:59,779
What did you call her?

124
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:01,380
Miss—

125
00:12:02,579 --> 00:12:04,459
I call her Mrs. Lu in public.

126
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:07,020
I will call her "Sister-in-law" from now on.

127
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:11,080
Sister-in-law has come back to you now. How will you celebrate your birthday tomorrow?

128
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:16,500
Birthday...

129
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,859
There's no need to celebrate.

130
00:12:17,859 --> 00:12:20,399
You need to pay homage to my father (Chinese funeral ritual) with me this afternoon.

131
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,320
All right.

132
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,820
President Lu is in a good mood today.

133
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,960
However, he still doesn't want to celebrate his birthday.

134
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,499
He has overcome his fear of the dark,

135
00:12:35,499 --> 00:12:38,420
but Uncle Lu's death anniversary is also on his birthday.

136
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,040
He still hasn't gotten over that yet.

137
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,540
We should throw him a birthday party!

138
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,619
No.

139
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:45,699
We can't try to treat him by force.

140
00:12:45,699 --> 00:12:46,780
I need to find another way out.

141
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,060
All right. Sounds good.

142
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,739
Feel free to tell me if you need any help, Sister-in-law.

143
00:12:49,739 --> 00:12:51,820
"Sister-in-law"?

144
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,940
President Lu asked me to call you that.

145
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,579
Xiao Xi, are you free tonight?

146
00:13:05,579 --> 00:13:08,180
As of now, I do not have any plans for tonight.

147
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,900
I recently found out about this new restaurant.

148
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,300
I thought we can have dinner together there.

149
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,359
Hello?

150
00:13:14,359 --> 00:13:16,719
- Xiao Xi, are you back?
- Yes.

151
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:19,200
We just finished filming, and I am exhausted.

152
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,420
I've come back now.

153
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:22,060
I have something to tell you.

154
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,140
Okay.

155
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:26,219
- Let's meet at my house then.
- Okay.

156
00:13:26,219 --> 00:13:27,979
Okay. I'll see you later!

157
00:13:27,979 --> 00:13:29,099
Was that Jian'an?

158
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,780
Yes, Jian'an has something to tell me.

159
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:31,980
I will go, too.

160
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,620
I'm going to be chatting with my sister.

161
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,579
Why would you come along?

162
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:35,500
What's wrong with that?

163
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,440
I am your sister, too.

164
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,940
Jiang Shao Kai!

165
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,420
Then go.

166
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,480
Thanks.

167
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,225
I didn't know Lu Bo Yan had been through a lot.

168
00:13:53,225 --> 00:13:55,420
I want to give him a perfect birthday

169
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,799
so he can have some happy memories

170
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,099
when he recalls his birthday.

171
00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:03,225
- I didn't expect that he would have had such a rough experience.
- Right.

172
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:07,820
That's why I want to give him a special gift.

173
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,740
This is so difficult.

174
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,699
People like President Lu lack nothing.

175
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:14,419
Actually I want to send him...

176
00:14:14,419 --> 00:14:16,020
What?

177
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:20,199
I want to send myself to him.

178
00:14:25,479 --> 00:14:28,260
All right, everyone. That's all for today.

179
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,840
President Lu.

180
00:14:31,619 --> 00:14:32,959
Let's disperse.

181
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,559
You are all dismissed.

182
00:14:35,819 --> 00:14:39,621
President Lu. You can go home to see Sister-in-law early today.

183
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,259
President Lu, I will text tomorrow's schedule to you on WeChat later.

184
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,540
What is this?

185
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,219
I don't know. Isn't it a delivery for you?

186
00:14:52,219 --> 00:14:54,319
I haven't ordered anything, though.

187
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,859
Don't send unidentified things to my office.

188
00:14:57,859 --> 00:15:00,600
Yes, Sir. I'll call someone to take care of it.

189
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,340
Goodbye.

190
00:15:30,459 --> 00:15:32,460
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

191
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,560
What are you doing?`

192
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,560
- We're celebrating your birthday!
- Yes.

193
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,939
Isn't Jian'an with you?

194
00:15:41,939 --> 00:15:43,439
- Jian'an?
- What?

195
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,679
Jian'an is not with me.

196
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,459
Jian'an put herself in a box...

197
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:49,259
Box?

198
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,320
[Jian'an]

199
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:58,260
[Unpleasant]

200
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:02,100
Jian'an left her phone with me.

201
00:16:10,439 --> 00:16:11,620
Yue Chuan.

202
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,500
Where did you send the box in my office?

203
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,540
- The workers took it away.
- Find it!

204
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,579
All right! I will.

205
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:39,040
President Lu, they sent it to Chengnan Waste Station.

206
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,200
Jian'an! Jian'an!

207
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,080
Young Man, stop searching.

208
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:58,620
If you didn't cherish it, then it's difficult to have it back again.

209
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:02,379
Uncle. Have you seen a pink box about this big?

210
00:17:02,379 --> 00:17:03,525
I don't know.

211
00:17:03,525 --> 00:17:07,019
However, today's waste has been thrown into the incinerator.

212
00:17:07,019 --> 00:17:08,919
Incinerator?

213
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:10,340
Where is the incinerator?

214
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,140
Over there!

215
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,639
Smelly radish!

216
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:24,550
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

217
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:26,920
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

218
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:31,600
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

219
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:32,730
♫ Yes ♫

220
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:35,380
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

221
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,840
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

222
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,280
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

223
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,980
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

224
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:49,710
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

225
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:52,490
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

226
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,190
♫ The signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

227
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:57,900
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

228
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,819
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

229
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:02,519
It's all right now.

230
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:10,290
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

231
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,370
♫ A first draft without script ♫

232
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:18,020
♫ Is such an affectionate trap ♫

233
00:18:23,925 --> 00:18:26,680
Jian'an will be fine, won't she?

234
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,919
I think so.

235
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,200
She has hands and feet.

236
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,779
Maybe she already came out of the box.

237
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,500
Don't worry.

238
00:18:53,119 --> 00:18:54,399
Where have you been?

239
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,960
I was so scared!

240
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,820
See, don't you think I am well? I am well.

241
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,399
Jian'an, we were so worried!

242
00:19:03,399 --> 00:19:05,719
Look at your face. It's so dirty now.

243
00:19:05,719 --> 00:19:07,339
You should clean it.

244
00:19:07,339 --> 00:19:08,759
I'm sorry for the trouble.

245
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,040
You were so worried about her.

246
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,659
It's late now.

247
00:19:11,659 --> 00:19:13,439
- We will celebrate another day.
- All right.

248
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,620
Jian'an, we'll leave now.

249
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,200
Eat the cake first.

250
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,720
We don't want to disturb you.

251
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,239
Let's go.

252
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,560
Let's go inside now.

253
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:46,019
- Today was so weird.
- That's so cute!

254
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:47,861
Luo Xiao Xi. Look.

255
00:19:47,861 --> 00:19:50,300
Today, the stars are in pairs.

256
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,620
And even the people here are walking in pairs.

257
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,820
Say what you want.

258
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,680
This fairy wants to go back home and have a beauty sleep.

259
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,280
Okay.

260
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,159
- I will tell you.
- Okay.

261
00:20:01,699 --> 00:20:04,459
- I don't want to be your friend anymore.
- What?

262
00:20:04,459 --> 00:20:08,120
I love you. Please be my girlfriend.

263
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,699
You are very domineering and unreasonable.

264
00:20:13,699 --> 00:20:16,686
We quarrel a lot, and you're always tweaking my ears.

265
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:19,259
But after that night,

266
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:23,225
I couldn't get you out of my head.

267
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:27,700
Luo Xiao Xi, I really love you.

268
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:39,479
Hey, hey, stop!

269
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,760
What do you mean?

270
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,559
Don't play around with me.

271
00:20:43,559 --> 00:20:46,200
You must give me an answer today.

272
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,760
I can be your girlfriend,

273
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:57,060
but you are surrounded by so many other women.

274
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:59,419
I can't see your sincerity.

275
00:20:59,419 --> 00:21:02,040
My heart, in God's name—

276
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:04,019
That's so fake!

277
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,759
You just have to promise me three things,

278
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,200
and I might consider it.

279
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,600
Okay, say it.

280
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,480
I have a car, house and money.

281
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,280
Cheesy.

282
00:21:32,019 --> 00:21:33,319
I sent it to you.

283
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:34,559
Take a good look.

284
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:38,079
Think it over before you make a decision.

285
00:21:38,079 --> 00:21:41,019
Call me after you have decided.

286
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,460
Bye!

287
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,140
Do you know how much you scared me today?

288
00:22:17,359 --> 00:22:18,959
I'm sorry.

289
00:22:20,739 --> 00:22:22,039
Jian'an.

290
00:22:22,039 --> 00:22:26,225
Don't ever do this again, okay?

291
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,859
Bo Yan.

292
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,179
Let's celebrate your birthday.

293
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,099
Not today. Let's do it another day.

294
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,500
I just want you to have some happy memories

295
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,259
when you recall your birthday.

296
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,100
- Wait for me.
- Yes.

297
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,839
Are you all right?

298
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,299
Why are you being so mysterious?

299
00:23:19,299 --> 00:23:21,380
Wait a little more.

300
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,019
Is that okay?

301
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:28,200
Yes!

302
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,239
Come on.

303
00:23:39,559 --> 00:23:40,859
Sit.

304
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,960
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

305
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:51,000
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

306
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:54,760
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

307
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:58,040
♪ Happy birthday to you! ♪

308
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,320
Make a wish and blow out the candle.

309
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:06,719
Blow out the candle.

310
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:12,760
Taste the cake.

311
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:17,959
Do you like it?

312
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:24,420
What about my gift?

313
00:24:25,079 --> 00:24:27,140
Wait a moment.

314
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,300
Turn off the lights.

315
00:25:37,019 --> 00:25:38,419
Are you sure?

316
00:25:38,419 --> 00:25:40,140
I'm sure.

317
00:26:36,979 --> 00:26:39,480
Didn't you touch me enough last night?

318
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,839
Why did you wake up so early?

319
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:50,375
You did, too.

320
00:26:56,975 --> 00:27:01,640
So... weren't you tired enough last night?

321
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:03,639
I'm tired.

322
00:27:03,639 --> 00:27:05,439
I'm really tired.

323
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:07,180
How tired are you?

324
00:27:31,059 --> 00:27:33,760
How are you? Did you rest?

325
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,079
It's time for you to make breakfast.

326
00:27:38,079 --> 00:27:39,839
You smelly, annoying radish!

327
00:27:39,839 --> 00:27:42,319
Are you trying to wear me out?

328
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:00,540
- Jian'an.
- Yes?

329
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:03,919
I have to attend a meeting now.

330
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:04,979
Go on.

331
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:06,779
I am going to work.

332
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,960
- Work?
- Yes.

333
00:28:10,319 --> 00:28:12,779
If you need inspiration,

334
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:14,939
remember that I am your consultant.

335
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:16,819
Yes, I will.

336
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:19,759
Goodbye.

337
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,960
Hello.

338
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,639
How are your preparations going?

339
00:28:41,639 --> 00:28:44,120
I'm all set. I am waiting for you.

340
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,159
Okay.

341
00:28:45,159 --> 00:28:47,300
I'll see you there!

342
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,960
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

343
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:10,240
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

344
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:15,000
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

345
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,130
♫ Yes ♫

346
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,880
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

347
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:23,200
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

348
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,660
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

349
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,470
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

350
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:33,090
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

351
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:35,880
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

352
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,590
♫ The signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

353
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:41,320
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

354
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:45,020
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

355
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,170
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

356
00:29:48,170 --> 00:29:53,920
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

357
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,640
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

358
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:00,370
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

359
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:03,140
♫ Warning all problems ♫

360
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,890
♫ To stay away from us ♫

361
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:08,570
♫ No one can take my place ♫

362
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:12,380
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

363
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:15,430
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

364
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:21,000
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
