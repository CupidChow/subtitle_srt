[Episode 12]

13
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,600
What's wrong, Mrs. Lu?

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,739
You're looking for inspiration, right?

15
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,100
I'm fine.

16
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,119
How about this?

17
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:22,299
You should go shopping.

18
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:25,918
Buy a bag, clothes or something. Okay?

19
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:27,999
What's wrong?

20
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:30,919
Doesn't going shopping make you happy?

21
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,300
It does.

22
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,030
It's just that...

23
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,440
everyone calls me Mrs. Lu now.

24
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,359
It seems like I'll be nothing if I leave you.

25
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,600
There's nothing wrong with being Mrs. Lu.

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,059
If you want to write novels,

27
00:01:46,059 --> 00:01:49,219
I can help you publish as many novels as you like.

28
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,219
Wouldn't you like that?

29
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:53,539
I don't mean it that way.

30
00:01:53,539 --> 00:01:55,580
So what do you mean?

31
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,679
I mean...

32
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,900
I don't want to just be your accessory.

33
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,820
Sorry.

34
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:15,020
I want to go to the bookstore now.

35
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's talk more tonight.

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,560
"I don't want to be your accessory."

37
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:42,000
What does she mean?

38
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:48,200
Sometimes, the more you care, the more counterproductive it will be.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,860
President Lu, you must know what she wants the most.

40
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,960
Of course, I know.

41
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,219
I respect her dream,

42
00:02:53,219 --> 00:02:55,580
but I need to fulfill my responsibility as her husband.

43
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,360
You spoil Miss Su too much.

44
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,780
You do everything for her personally.

45
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,660
That can't reflect Miss Su's ability and value.

46
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,660
While performing your husbandly duties,

47
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:08,920
you need to consider her job and living space.

48
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,950
I think it would be better if you protected her in secret.

49
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:37,160
Do you like this novel, too?

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,860
Thank you.

51
00:03:39,575 --> 00:03:42,200
Nowadays, people like to read online novels.

52
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,575
It's rare to see people who love this kind of classic novel.

53
00:03:46,119 --> 00:03:48,179
I'm an online novelist.

54
00:03:48,179 --> 00:03:51,616
I just want to read some classics for inspiration.

55
00:03:51,616 --> 00:03:54,759
So you are a writer.

56
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,699
Not yet.

57
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:00,839
Even if you are not now, you will be in the future.

58
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,200
Do you also like this novel?

59
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,199
You can have it then.

60
00:04:06,839 --> 00:04:08,539
Ladies first.

61
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,959
The story is about a girl in the pursuit

62
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,526
of herself, her freedom and dignity amidst tribulations.

63
00:04:15,526 --> 00:04:18,960
I think you may need it more now.

64
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,620
Perhaps.

65
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,975
It seems that you have writer's block.

66
00:04:28,975 --> 00:04:32,699
I seem to be stuck in a circle,

67
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,139
as if everything is pre-arranged.

68
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:37,519
I just can't get out of it.

"Read 10,000 books and travel 10,000 miles."

70
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:44,080
Seeing your condition, I think you've been suppressed for too long.

71
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,525
You could go for a trip and see the world.

72
00:04:46,525 --> 00:04:49,160
You should meet more people and experience the things out there.

73
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,879
I believe you will gain something.

74
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,259
Go on a trip?

75
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,500
Creation is closely related to life experience.

76
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,840
I think you will benefit a lot from a new environment,

77
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:04,139
full of challenges and adventures.

78
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,579
Of course, that's my humble opinion.

79
00:05:15,299 --> 00:05:17,939
President Kang, Director Guo wants to see you.

80
00:05:18,659 --> 00:05:21,538
Sorry, I have to go now.

81
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,380
Thank you.

[Jane Eyre]

83
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,861
President Kang, during your absence,

84
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:03,125
Lu's Media did a lot of things.

85
00:06:03,125 --> 00:06:05,160
Whether it's a company or personal matters,

86
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,460
the biggest competitor is none other than one's self.

87
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,800
Yes, you are right.

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,299
Director Guo has agreed to shoot our film.

89
00:06:13,299 --> 00:06:16,999
The first movie of Ruijin Group will go viral nationwide.

90
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:20,000
It's not easy to succeed.

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,779
Yes.

92
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,141
Director Guo, what do you think of this script?

93
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:48,420
President Kang, it's about the love story of a very capable woman.

94
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,140
It's quite novel,

95
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,060
and it suits the audience's interests nowadays.

96
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,659
But I think something is missing.

97
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:56,856
The hints of emotions are not good enough.

98
00:06:56,856 --> 00:06:58,299
It needs to be revised.

99
00:06:58,299 --> 00:07:01,179
It may be a hit.

100
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,649
As I understand,

101
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:06,659
you have a good relationship with President Du of Taoran Literature Network.

102
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:09,419
We are elementary schoolmates.

103
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,620
His Literature Network has many female-orientated novelists.

104
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,739
Actually, you can discuss it with him.

105
00:07:14,739 --> 00:07:16,039
Okay.

106
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:17,720
If there's nothing else, I'll get going.

107
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,620
All right.

108
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,681
By the way, we should settle the leading actor as soon as possible.

109
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:23,500
- Okay.
- Bye, President Kang.

110
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,260
- Okay, bye.
- Bye bye.

111
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,899
Sister, stop drinking.

112
00:07:49,899 --> 00:07:51,379
Go away.

113
00:07:51,379 --> 00:07:52,860
Go.

114
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:57,298
Stop drinking. Stop drinking, Sister!

115
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,899
I told you to go away!

116
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:04,200
Sister Ruo Xi, don't do this.

117
00:08:05,679 --> 00:08:07,319
Do you know what?

118
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:10,220
A lot of people out there love you.

119
00:08:11,175 --> 00:08:14,620
Even if you leave Lu Group, many companies will want to sign you.

120
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:18,620
Sister, why don't I set up meetings with them for you?

121
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,925
Lu Bo Yan.

122
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:43,599
I'll have you know

123
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,580
that I'll be

124
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,200
better without you.

125
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,420
Things will definitely get better for you.

126
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,960
Yue Yue, I'm really not in the mood to deal with my contract right now.

127
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:11,340
Sister, this boss is very persistent.

128
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,778
He has already contacted me several times.

129
00:09:13,778 --> 00:09:16,139
As far as I know, it's quite a great company.

130
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,458
They also made a very generous offer.

131
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:23,179
Sister, you haven't paid off Lu Group's breach of contract penalty yet.

132
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:24,418
Here it is.

133
00:09:24,418 --> 00:09:26,219
Let's just go in and have a look.

134
00:09:26,219 --> 00:09:28,198
We're here already anyway.

135
00:09:28,198 --> 00:09:31,639
Sister Ruo Xi, this is Mr. Kang Rui Cheng.

136
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,019
Kang Rui Cheng?

137
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,640
Kang Rui Cheng of the Ruijin Group?

138
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,899
Hello, Miss Han.

139
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:41,620
I have heard a lot about you.

140
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,699
Hello.

141
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:45,100
Take a seat.

142
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,999
I will leave you two to talk!

143
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:51,500
Thank you.

144
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:53,879
Miss Han, you are an excellent actress.

145
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:55,649
You left the Lu Group so suddenly.

146
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:57,749
It was very surprising.

147
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,720
Sorry, President Kang.

148
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,658
I'm really not in the mood to discuss signing any contracts.

149
00:10:02,658 --> 00:10:05,419
Miss Han, don't jump to any conclusions yet.

150
00:10:05,419 --> 00:10:08,140
Why don't you take a look at this first?

151
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:28,160
What do you think of this project?

152
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:33,539
It's not bad.

153
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:37,815
Miss Han, I don't know why you left the Lu Group,

154
00:10:37,815 --> 00:10:40,924
but I believe that as long as you join the Ruijin Group,

155
00:10:40,924 --> 00:10:44,220
you will achieve more than you did in the past.

156
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:48,474
Then those who ignored you in the past will see you in a completely different light.

157
00:10:48,474 --> 00:10:50,279
Please consider it.

158
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,619
I have a condition.

159
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:00,120
Please tell me.

160
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:06,419
I want a grand signing ceremony.

161
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:08,439
Okay.

162
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,200
Happy cooperation.

163
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:15,019
Happy cooperation.

164
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:26,424
Popular actress, Han Ruo Xi, signs a contract with the powerful Ruijin Group

165
00:11:26,425 --> 00:11:29,225
after the termination of her contract with Lu Group.

166
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:34,580
It seems Han Ruo Xi will continue to advance triumphantly in her career even after leaving Lu Group.

167
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:49,159
President.

168
00:11:49,159 --> 00:11:51,220
Mrs. Lu, why are you here?

169
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,899
I didn't arrange a meeting today.

170
00:11:52,899 --> 00:11:54,538
Come, sit down.

171
00:11:54,538 --> 00:11:57,578
- President. You should just call me Jian'an.
- Have some water.

172
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:59,520
It's the same.

173
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,450
I want to put my novel on hold for now.

174
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,919
No, Mrs. Lu!

175
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:09,149
Your novel will be in the top ten soon!

176
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:12,660
If you take a break now, we will suffer a big loss!

177
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:16,675
We can't ruin the ending, right?

178
00:12:16,675 --> 00:12:19,860
- Is it your stomach ache again?
- No.

179
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:22,640
Then why do you want to take a break?

180
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:27,818
How can you take a break now? Millions of readers are waiting for your update.

181
00:12:27,818 --> 00:12:30,319
My novel is indeed very popular right now.

182
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:33,219
But I'm sure you know the reason.

183
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,418
I... Of course, I know.

184
00:12:36,418 --> 00:12:40,950
Of course, it's because you are a good, creative writer.

185
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:43,478
You may not use fancy rhetoric,

186
00:12:43,478 --> 00:12:46,080
but your words can resonate with readers!

187
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:49,249
The story feels like it's happening around us,

188
00:12:49,249 --> 00:12:54,719
yet it's also out of reach and fascinating.

189
00:12:56,179 --> 00:13:01,320
President Du. You are so hysterical.

190
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,720
No, it's from the bottom of my heart.

191
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,718
My novel is indeed very popular now.

192
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:09,139
I'm also very happy about that.

193
00:13:09,139 --> 00:13:12,075
However, I know it's not because of my writing.

194
00:13:12,075 --> 00:13:15,119
But rather it's because of my title as Mrs. Lu.

195
00:13:15,119 --> 00:13:17,360
It's indeed a shortcut,

196
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,899
but I want to be acknowledged through my own efforts.

197
00:13:20,899 --> 00:13:24,058
How unexpected, unexpected.

198
00:13:24,058 --> 00:13:27,700
Jian'an, you are so sensible.

199
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:31,919
During your glorious times, you're choosing to step back.

200
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:34,019
In the future, you'll surely do great!

201
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:36,319
What are your plans now then?

202
00:13:36,319 --> 00:13:38,139
I want to adjust myself for a while.

203
00:13:38,139 --> 00:13:42,060
I will then make plans based on my writing experience during this period of time.

204
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,750
If this big celebrity leaves just like this, this will be huge loss.

205
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:49,560
Plus, I'm afraid President Lu might...

206
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,020
President.

207
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,260
What's the matter?

208
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,458
No one wants to be the screenwriter in the film crew. It's too tiring.

209
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,299
- No writer is willing to go.
- What crew?

210
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:04,458
Well, I have a friend.

211
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:07,160
He is shooting a film project adapted from a novel.

212
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,739
He needs a screenwriter who stays with the crew. It's mainly for the adaptation and adjustment of the follow-up script.

213
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:16,950
It's normal that young people these days want to avoid hard work.

214
00:14:16,950 --> 00:14:18,059
Forget it.

215
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,778
Let Director Guo know.

216
00:14:19,778 --> 00:14:21,499
- Okay.
- Hey, wait!

217
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:22,859
President, I'll go.

218
00:14:22,859 --> 00:14:24,999
No, Mrs. Lu!

219
00:14:24,999 --> 00:14:27,499
You and President Lu just got married.

220
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:30,274
If you go, you'll have to leave for a long time.

221
00:14:30,274 --> 00:14:33,718
And you know the crew will work in difficult conditions.

222
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:35,379
If President Lu knew about this, you—

223
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,598
President.

224
00:14:36,598 --> 00:14:40,099
Since Mrs. Lu sincerely wants to gain some experience in the crew,

225
00:14:40,099 --> 00:14:42,699
just let her go.

226
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:46,520
President, as long as you allow me to go, you don't have to worry about the other things.

227
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,919
I will persuade Lu Bo Yan.

228
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:58,958
Jian'an, since you are so determined...

229
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:00,660
Okay.

230
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,360
Go then.

231
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,800
At the very beginning of marriage, the couple are very ambitious.

232
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,825
They are busy with their own careers.

233
00:15:15,825 --> 00:15:21,875
The worst thing is when one side keeps disturbing the other, who is busy with work,

234
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,349
then becomes too clingy.

235
00:15:23,349 --> 00:15:26,298
This will cause conflict between the couple.

236
00:15:26,298 --> 00:15:29,079
Especially young women in the new era,

237
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:32,418
- they pursue independence in thinking and finance.
- Too clingy?

238
00:15:32,418 --> 00:15:34,899
- They have their own professional pursuit.
- Conflict?

239
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,139
Space?

240
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,159
You're back.

241
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:58,359
Bo Yan. I want to tell you something about my work.

242
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:01,659
Jian'an, people have their own career.

243
00:16:01,659 --> 00:16:05,659
As long as it's the right decision, I will support you.

244
00:16:05,659 --> 00:16:10,319
I... plan to go work in another city...

245
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:11,598
for two months.

246
00:16:11,598 --> 00:16:12,699
Okay.

247
00:16:12,699 --> 00:16:14,539
- Really?
- It's just two months anyway...

248
00:16:14,539 --> 00:16:17,400
- Two months?
- Yes, two months.

249
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,924
No way! I disagree!

250
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:24,740
Listen, Bo Yan!

251
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,340
Let her go.

252
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,780
Don't let her go.

253
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,439
Let her go.

254
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,159
Don't let her go.

255
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,379
Let her go.

256
00:16:32,379 --> 00:16:33,859
Don't let her go.

257
00:16:33,859 --> 00:16:35,520
Let her go.

258
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,759
- Don't let her go.
- President Lu.

259
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:39,939
What are you doing?

260
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:44,590
- Counting.
- Counting?

261
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:47,599
By the way, Yue Chuan,

262
00:16:47,599 --> 00:16:52,574
if I left the company to you for two months, would that be okay?

263
00:16:52,574 --> 00:16:53,899
Don't joke around, President Lu!

264
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:56,879
The company can't do without you.

265
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,150
You're right.

266
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,218
Go back to work then.

267
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:12,879
Where was I?

268
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,459
Whatever.

269
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:16,419
Let her go.

270
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,019
Don't let her go.

271
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:21,439
Let her go.

272
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,539
Don't let her go.

273
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,760
Let her go. Don't let her go.

274
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,740
I won't let you go!

275
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:49,560
Do you have another interview today?

276
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:52,538
- This time it's for a movie.
- A movie?

277
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:53,698
What movie?

278
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,139
The director is quite famous.

279
00:17:55,139 --> 00:17:58,499
- After looking at my profile, he thinks I am great.
- Really?

280
00:17:58,499 --> 00:18:00,210
Of course.

281
00:18:00,210 --> 00:18:01,830
[Temptation of My Sister-in-law]

282
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,620
[Temptation of My Sister-in-law]

283
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:08,019
Luo Xiao Xi, don't tell me you're auditioning for this!

284
00:18:08,019 --> 00:18:09,659
Yes. What's wrong with it?

285
00:18:09,659 --> 00:18:11,439
No, I disagree.

286
00:18:11,439 --> 00:18:12,779
Do you disagree?

287
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:15,400
Jiang Shao Kai, did I ask for your opinion?

288
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,978
Are you looking for a beating again?

289
00:18:16,978 --> 00:18:18,179
I...

290
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:21,675
I am just worried about you.

291
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,679
I'm just auditioning anyway.

292
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,039
I may not pass.

293
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,700
I am just here for more audition experience.

294
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,840
Just relax and wait for me outside.

295
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,878
Then call me if you need me.

296
00:18:35,878 --> 00:18:37,479
Okay!

297
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,539
"Why are you wearing your sister's pajamas?"

298
00:18:44,539 --> 00:18:46,880
Since we want a thrill,

299
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,099
then we should go all the way.

300
00:18:49,099 --> 00:18:50,979
"You little sl*t."

301
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,925
Isn't that what you like about me?

302
00:18:59,979 --> 00:19:01,379
Cut!

303
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,979
Director.

304
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,418
How was my performance just now?

305
00:19:08,418 --> 00:19:10,620
You indeed have good qualities,

306
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,459
but you weren't in very good condition.

307
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:14,099
No, give me another chance!

308
00:19:14,099 --> 00:19:15,719
I promise I can do it better.

309
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:17,920
Wait for my reply.

310
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,759
Next!

311
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,080
Xiao Xi,

312
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:38,919
your performance really disappointed me.

313
00:19:38,919 --> 00:19:40,359
Director, I'm still a rookie.

314
00:19:40,359 --> 00:19:42,019
I know I have many shortcomings.

315
00:19:42,019 --> 00:19:43,379
Please give me more pointers.

316
00:19:43,379 --> 00:19:44,539
I will go home and practice hard.

317
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:46,440
Actually, acting requires talent.

318
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,680
We need to liberate our nature.

319
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,700
How about this? I can help you. Give me your hand.

320
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,359
Actors need to release their nature.

321
00:19:55,359 --> 00:19:57,679
You have to integrate yourself into the role—

322
00:19:59,179 --> 00:20:02,119
Look at you. So rigid.

323
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,440
You can't liberate yourself.

324
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,040
Come, let me help you.

325
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,399
Libe—

326
00:20:06,399 --> 00:20:09,319
Director Fang, mind your behavior!

327
00:20:09,319 --> 00:20:11,200
Luo Xiao Xi, let me tell you,

328
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,450
your acting is not good enough.

329
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,280
You may not pass.

330
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:20,125
But as long as I say the word, the role is yours.

331
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:21,359
You've asked the wrong person.

332
00:20:21,359 --> 00:20:23,159
Goodbye!

333
00:20:23,159 --> 00:20:25,419
You obscure little girl,

334
00:20:25,419 --> 00:20:27,218
I am giving you a chance to climb to the top!

335
00:20:27,218 --> 00:20:28,660
How shameless are you?

336
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:31,720
Let go. I will count to three.

337
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,300
Let go? You sure are a fierce one.

338
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,500
Three!

339
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,539
Fierce one?

340
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,339
I will teach you a lesson!

341
00:20:38,339 --> 00:20:40,040
How dare you harass me?

342
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,240
I will beat you to death!

343
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,100
- Gosh.
- How dare you harass me?

344
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,540
Did you call me fierce?

345
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,838
Stop, stop.

346
00:20:48,839 --> 00:20:49,641
I will kill him!

347
00:20:49,641 --> 00:20:51,359
Help! Catch the crazy woman!

348
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,780
I will beat him to death today! Let me go!

349
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,800
What's going on?

350
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,659
This scoundrel harassed me!

351
00:20:55,659 --> 00:20:57,559
He harassed you?

352
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,639
Did you harass my woman?

353
00:21:02,639 --> 00:21:04,539
Help!

354
00:21:04,539 --> 00:21:07,599
Stop it. That's enough.

355
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:10,520
Are you okay?

356
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,559
I am fine.

357
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:14,200
You brat, how dare you beat me!

358
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,359
Don't go. I will call the police!

359
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:17,739
Call the police?

360
00:21:17,739 --> 00:21:19,480
Do you know who I am?

361
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,460
Who are you?

362
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,259
- "I am your father!"
- Stop it.

363
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:24,059
I beat him enough already.

364
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,760
I just can't help it.

365
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,480
Let's go.

366
00:21:35,079 --> 00:21:38,440
Help! Someone beat the director!

367
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,858
Go. Run.

368
00:21:40,858 --> 00:21:42,040
What happened to you, Director?

369
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:44,340
- Someone hit me.
- Chase after them!

370
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,200
This way.

371
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,620
- Stop!
- Don't run!

372
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:54,259
Don't run! Stop!

373
00:21:54,259 --> 00:21:54,940
You go over there!

374
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:57,040
- Okay!
- Go! This way!

375
00:22:18,119 --> 00:22:20,219
Jiang Shao Kai.

376
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:24,700
Who did you call your woman just then?

377
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:25,900
I...

378
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:29,180
I... said it in the heat of the moment.

379
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:35,600
I'm surprised. You were quite manly just then.

380
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,400
Of course!

381
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,560
Did it help you relieve your anger?

382
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,319
That's your reward.

383
00:22:50,319 --> 00:22:53,575
Remember to go to the next audition with me.

384
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:02,800
I'm at your disposal!

385
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:16,800
Hello, Brother Qin.

386
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:18,200
It's me, Shao Kai.

387
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,639
I met a scumbag within our industry.

388
00:23:19,639 --> 00:23:21,279
Help me teach him a lesson.

389
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,040
Where's Jian'an?

390
00:23:36,879 --> 00:23:39,979
Did she run away again? Did it have to come to this?

391
00:23:39,979 --> 00:23:42,079
Deviant!

392
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,900
Sorry about just now.

393
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:32,480
We should forget what happened just now.

394
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,440
Lu Bo Yan.

395
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:44,300
I still want to talk to you about my work.

396
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,050
I have my own ideas and career plans.

397
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,175
Although...

398
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:51,625
staying with the crew for two months is quite a long time,

399
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,819
I hope you can support me.

400
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:58,359
I want to gain experience by working with the crew as a staff member.

401
00:24:58,359 --> 00:25:00,350
I want to broaden my horizons

402
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:02,679
and increase my life experience.

403
00:25:02,679 --> 00:25:05,580
I don't want to write all my novels to be...

404
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,080
I understand.

405
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,079
So do you agree?

406
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:11,179
No.

407
00:25:11,179 --> 00:25:13,460
Do you want to slip away again?

408
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,079
You can go,

409
00:25:20,079 --> 00:25:21,640
but I have a few requests.

410
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,280
What requests?

411
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,240
[1. Feed each other. 2. Watch fireworks. 3. Ride a two-seat bicycle. 4. Eat malatang (spicy hotpot). 5. Play Virtual Reality. 6. Kiss]

412
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,359
Isn't this the love list that I previously made?

413
00:25:34,359 --> 00:25:38,600
You can go as long as you complete all the requirements on there.

414
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,119
Okay.

415
00:25:40,119 --> 00:25:42,119
- Then I also have a request.
- What?

416
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,010
- Hey.
- Yes?

417
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,960
Why do we have to dress like this?

418
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,580
Because this is a matching couples outfit.

419
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,358
I've always wanted to wear one with the person that I li—

420
00:25:58,358 --> 00:26:00,900
I've always wanted to try it with someone.

421
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:04,119
So is this your first time wearing matching clothes with someone?

422
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,719
Of course.

423
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:12,580
♫ Yes. There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

424
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:16,900
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

425
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,330
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

426
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,100
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

427
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,820
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

428
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:32,230
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive the signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

429
00:26:32,230 --> 00:26:34,880
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

430
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,650
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

431
00:26:38,650 --> 00:26:41,810
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

432
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:47,130
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

433
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,919
Are you tired?

434
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:50,260
No.

435
00:26:51,119 --> 00:26:52,440
Thank you very much for today.

436
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,240
I had a great time.

437
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:57,760
Actually, thank you very much for everything all this time.

438
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,300
You did a lot for me.

439
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,900
I know all this.

440
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,719
Actually,

441
00:27:02,719 --> 00:27:04,800
I'm just doing what I want to do.

442
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,300
It's nothing.

443
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,960
After our relationship was exposed,

444
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,800
my novels indeed gained more readers.

445
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,599
I've been writing for so many years, but this is the first time that so many people are reading my novel.

446
00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:18,800
I was overjoyed for a long time!

447
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,740
But we all know the reason why this happened.

448
00:27:23,699 --> 00:27:25,225
Jian'an,

449
00:27:25,225 --> 00:27:30,175
are you bothered by becoming Mrs. Lu?

450
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,440
No.

451
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,925
I really like this novel of mine,

452
00:27:34,925 --> 00:27:38,720
but I want to gain recognition with my own efforts.

453
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,120
I see.

454
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:48,919
I believe you can write even better novels.

455
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:50,280
Don't forget.

456
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:53,240
I will always be your most loyal fan.

457
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,820
Okay?

458
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:58,240
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

459
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,560
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫

460
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,000
This one seems great.

461
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,859
Her image fits the role.

462
00:28:11,859 --> 00:28:13,619
I think she's great, too.

463
00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:15,918
President! Director Guo is here as well.

464
00:28:15,918 --> 00:28:17,920
Shao Kai, you're right on time. Hurry.

465
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,639
Come, Shao Kai. Sit down.

466
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:24,499
President, it was all thanks to Shao Kai for introducing so many industry resources to us

467
00:28:24,499 --> 00:28:25,959
that things went so smoothly.

468
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:27,524
We are family. No need to be so polite!

469
00:28:27,524 --> 00:28:29,945
He is just an arrogant brat.

470
00:28:29,945 --> 00:28:33,849
Director Guo, as I understand, there are still a few roles in your movie that haven't been decided yet, right?

471
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:36,279
We're missing an actor of this style. We are picking some now.

472
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:39,680
What a coincidence! I have a friend who is very talented.

473
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:42,220
She has good qualities, but she needs a chance.

474
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,600
I wonder if you would have any interest in being the one to discover such a talent.

475
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,800
If it's someone you recommend, I have to agree, of course.

476
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,799
All right. Arrange for her to come for an interview tomorrow.

477
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,100
It's a deal then.

478
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,119
So we don't need to look at these anymore?

479
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:07,559
How did it go?

480
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,200
Did he say you're not suitable? It's okay.

481
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:17,019
We can try another role next time.

482
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,559
I passed!

483
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,419
The director said I am very suitable for this role!

484
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,800
Really? I knew you could do it!

485
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:28,740
Of course. I am very talented.

486
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,739
Shao Kai, why didn't you come in?

487
00:29:31,739 --> 00:29:34,875
I... I just dropped by... to see a friend.

488
00:29:34,875 --> 00:29:36,940
Hello, Director.

489
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:41,450
Okay, I will let you two talk.

490
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,760
Do you know each other?

491
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,279
Don't misunderstand.

492
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,700
Director Guo happened to have a project that he still needed actors for.

493
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:55,959
I thought that rather than having you go out to random auditions, Director Guo's project is more reliable.

494
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:57,658
So I gave him your profile.

495
00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:59,959
I promise I didn't use my connections.

496
00:29:59,959 --> 00:30:03,280
It's all because you have the ability. Really.

497
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,799
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

498
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:07,039
I was afraid you would feel some psychological pressure.

499
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,840
After all, you're so prideful.

500
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,620
Thanks. I will buy you some drinks later.

501
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,499
Drinks?

502
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:18,318
That's not a good idea, is it? In broad daylight?

503
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:21,219
We're just drinking!

504
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:31,220
Hello, everyone. The novel may be on hold for a while.

505
00:30:31,220 --> 00:30:34,600
Chief, don't abandon us!

506
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,079
We won't be able to get our fix of sweetness now!

507
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:39,680
So sad.

508
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,879
How long will it be?

509
00:30:40,879 --> 00:30:43,939
Did something happen to you, Chief?

510
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:45,440
I'm fine.

511
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,258
Rest assured, I will be back as soon as possible.

512
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:57,699
Our Chief won't leave for too long. Please don't worry.

513
00:30:57,699 --> 00:30:59,700
Thank you.

514
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,900
It's my duty. Please rest assured, Chief.

515
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:11,278
Your readers will always be with you. We will stay and wait for you to return.

516
00:31:11,278 --> 00:31:15,825
Yes, we will be here waiting for your comeback!

517
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,398
Hello, Xiao Xi.

518
00:31:21,398 --> 00:31:24,499
I'm leaving to work with a film crew in Luochuan tomorrow for two months.

519
00:31:24,499 --> 00:31:25,580
I'm just letting you know.

520
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,358
Luochuan?

521
00:31:27,358 --> 00:31:29,019
Is it Director Guo's film?

522
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:30,919
Yes.

523
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:32,499
Jian'an, let me tell you,

524
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:34,780
I got a role in that film, too!

525
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,699
Really? That's so great!

526
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:38,199
Let's go together tomorrow then!

527
00:31:38,199 --> 00:31:39,500
Of course, we must!

528
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,938
We get to live together soon!

529
00:31:41,938 --> 00:31:43,939
See you at the station tomorrow then!

530
00:31:43,939 --> 00:31:45,639
Okay, see you there!

531
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:49,440
- Bye bye.
- Bye bye!

532
00:32:05,699 --> 00:32:08,899
Drink some milk. It's good for your health.

533
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:26,781
What is this?

534
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:28,318
The temperature will be very different when filming at night.

535
00:32:28,319 --> 00:32:29,400
Take more clothes.

536
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,199
I'll put it here.

537
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,159
The air isn't great these days either.

538
00:32:47,159 --> 00:32:49,675
You need to use this to protect your skin.

539
00:32:49,675 --> 00:32:51,739
Got it?

540
00:32:52,839 --> 00:32:55,280
Okay, President Lu.

541
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,080
I'll leave now.

542
00:34:55,479 --> 00:34:56,819
Lu Bo Yan!

543
00:34:56,819 --> 00:34:58,520
Uncle Xu!

544
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:02,339
Where did they all go so early in the morning?

545
00:35:10,939 --> 00:35:15,120
Bo Yan? I thought you went to work.

546
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,539
What is all this?

547
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:41,140
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

548
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,310
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

549
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:48,190
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

550
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,320
♫ Yes ♫

551
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:52,150
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

552
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:56,330
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

553
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:59,760
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

554
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:03,610
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

555
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:06,330
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

556
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:09,040
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

557
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,920
♫ The signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

558
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,520
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

559
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,270
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

560
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,390
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

561
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:27,190
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

562
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,850
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

563
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:33,560
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

564
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,460
♫ Warning all problems ♫

565
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:38,310
♫ To stay away from us ♫

566
00:36:38,310 --> 00:36:41,820
♫ No one can take my place ♫

567
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,550
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

568
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:48,690
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

569
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:54,970
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
