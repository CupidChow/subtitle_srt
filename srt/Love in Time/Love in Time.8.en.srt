00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,339
After all... everyone knows President Lu is married.

166
00:12:08,339 --> 00:12:09,940
So be it.

167
00:12:33,179 --> 00:12:35,379
Where are we going today?

168
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:38,339
I'll find an interesting bar to take you.

169
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,049
Lu Bo Yan won't be able to find it.

170
00:12:40,049 --> 00:12:43,858
We can drink more, and you can find inspiration there.

171
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:47,679
Do you want to drink again? Let's go to the bookstore instead.

172
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,679
That's so boring! I won't go.

173
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:51,299
Jian'an!

174
00:12:52,819 --> 00:12:54,419
Dad!

175
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:58,900
So have you made it clear to Han Ruo Xi?

176
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,424
Yes. She will cooperate with us to prove your innocence.

177
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:10,500
- Hello?
- Hello, President Lu!

178
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,899
Her dad is about to hand over the lingerie company to Jian'an.

179
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:15,279
You have to find a way out!

180
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:21,260
[The President of Lu Group and his former girlfriend, Han Ruo Xi, have a rendezvous at a hotel.]

181
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:25,538
What's going on? They hugged so tightly!

182
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:28,175
What's wrong with your marriage?

183
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:30,438
Dad, that's not it!

184
00:13:30,438 --> 00:13:34,179
Lu Bo Yan and Han Ruo Xi are just friends. They just had a meal together.

185
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:38,078
Don't you have any idea how the media like to exaggerate facts?

186
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,498
Do you think the rumors about Lu Bo Yan and Han Ruo Xi are not enough?

187
00:13:40,498 --> 00:13:43,610
I flipped through all the news of the past few years!

188
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,168
Do you think I am blind?

189
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:47,599
I trusted you because of your marriage certificate.

190
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:50,800
You two are childhood sweethearts.

191
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,375
Liar! Two young liars lied to an old man.

192
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:56,419
You are lying!

193
00:13:56,419 --> 00:13:59,858
Nonsense! It's true love!

194
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:01,774
Stop pretending.

195
00:14:01,774 --> 00:14:04,520
I know you best!

196
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:08,319
Divorce him as fast as possible. Come back and take over my company.

197
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:12,439
Dad! We had an agreement that I wouldn't inherit the company if I got married!

198
00:14:12,439 --> 00:14:14,300
What marriage are you talking about?

199
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,460
Your husband was unfaithful right after you got married.

200
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,439
Divorce him!

201
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:20,000
Sign this!
[Succession Agreement]

202
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,180
I won't!

203
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,739
Lu Bo Yan,

204
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:33,979
I don't want to talk about your mistreatment of my daughter.

205
00:14:33,979 --> 00:14:37,858
From now on, our families will part ways!

206
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:40,278
Bo Yan, please tell Dad!

207
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:43,179
Jian'an is my wife. Forever.

208
00:14:43,179 --> 00:14:44,798
Those are just the media's rumors.

209
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:48,099
Dad, you won't believe all of that so easily now, will you?

210
00:14:48,099 --> 00:14:51,600
How can you prove it?

211
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,859
Regarding the gossip, you will soon see the news.

212
00:14:54,859 --> 00:14:56,999
Jian'an and I will leave now.

213
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,500
You...

214
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,840
President Su, it's...

215
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,199
What are you doing? Let go of me!

216
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,399
We haven't left the company yet. It's all about pretense.

217
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,870
[Outpatient]

218
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:27,119
Doctor, I have not recovered yet.

219
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,779
I can't be discharged.

220
00:15:29,779 --> 00:15:32,078
Jiang Shao Kai, your body is completely healthy.

221
00:15:32,078 --> 00:15:34,919
You don't need to stay here anymore.

222
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:37,259
My heart hurts!

223
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:39,579
I think I'm about to die! I need oxygen!

224
00:15:39,579 --> 00:15:42,399
Doctor, save me. Doctor!

225
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,940
Doctor.

226
00:15:47,059 --> 00:15:49,720
Jiang Shao Kai! The doctor looked so serious.

227
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,599
- You don't have a terminal illness, do you?
- Nonsense!

228
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:55,420
Nonsense. Where's Jian'an?

229
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,199
She's busy. Only I have come to see you.

230
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,999
To see me?

231
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:02,050
You have forgotten your savior, haven't you?

232
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,938
You are injured, but you are a hero.

233
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:06,339
That's right!

234
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:08,500
Without my intervention,

235
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,090
you would have been bitten by that snake!

236
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:16,738
My back is itching, but I can't reach it. Help me.

237
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:20,900
What are you waiting for? Is this how you repay your savior?

238
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,679
Hurry, hurry.

239
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,660
All right.

240
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,178
A little lower. To the left!

241
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,578
Yes, yes. Yes... A little to the right.

242
00:16:37,578 --> 00:16:40,259
Yes, yes! Harder!

243
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,199
All right!

244
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:50,558
You can't even scratch! My goodness.

245
00:16:51,475 --> 00:16:55,771
By the way, why did you come empty-handed?

246
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:01,418
Well, Young Master Jiang, what would you like to eat?

247
00:17:01,418 --> 00:17:03,355
Nothing special.

248
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,619
I would like a slice of crispy pork, spicy chicken,

249
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:09,498
duck, sea food, and poultry.

250
00:17:09,498 --> 00:17:11,539
And crystal hooves too! So great!

251
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:15,278
I also want a fish pot and drinks. Oh, right,

252
00:17:15,278 --> 00:17:18,500
coffee is bad for my health so I will have milk tea instead. Matcha flavor.

253
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:20,179
Half the sugar, and no ice.

254
00:17:20,179 --> 00:17:23,880
I need sugar, grass jelly, and red beans with... a milk cover.

255
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,418
That should be it.

256
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,019
You should add more. That's not enough.

257
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,739
No need, that's enough.

258
00:17:28,739 --> 00:17:31,038
All right, wait here.

259
00:17:31,038 --> 00:17:33,639
This is awesome! Scratch my back again.

260
00:17:33,639 --> 00:17:37,059
Luo Xiao Xi!

261
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:45,258
I won't thank you just for saving me.

262
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:46,759
This is all your fault.

263
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:55,799
Let me go! What do you want from me?

264
00:17:55,799 --> 00:17:57,579
I'm not Han Ruo Xi!

265
00:17:57,579 --> 00:18:01,779
Jian'an, I can tell the difference between you and Han Ruo Xi very well.

266
00:18:01,779 --> 00:18:05,350
Your relationship with Han Ruo Xi has nothing to do with me.

267
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,740
- See for yourself.
- What is this?

268
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,419
Check it out yourself.

269
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,650
Shen Yue Chuan, assistant of President Lu of Lu's Media,

270
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,725
showed up with actress, Han Ruo Xi,

271
00:18:29,725 --> 00:18:34,100
to clarify the reason behind Lu Bo Yan and Han Ruo Xi's meeting at the hotel.

272
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,059
Everyone,

273
00:18:35,059 --> 00:18:37,025
President Lu and Miss Han have collaborated for years.

274
00:18:37,025 --> 00:18:39,480
They each went there for separate business

275
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,824
and the company booked the same hotel for both of them.

276
00:18:42,825 --> 00:18:46,733
Also, President Lu is absolutely loyal to his marriage and family.

277
00:18:46,733 --> 00:18:48,480
He and Mrs. Lu love each other very much

278
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,800
so please put a stop to your speculations.

279
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,325
That is true.

280
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:55,200
That day, I happened to be there for a magazine photoshoot,

281
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,760
and I am preparing to film a new movie.

282
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,075
The drunkenness and gaffe (mistake) were just practice for my next film.

283
00:19:01,075 --> 00:19:03,620
Yue Chuan was there, too.

284
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,680
Thanks to President Lu and Yue Chuan,

285
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,860
I can face this new role in a better condition.

286
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,879
I'm very sorry for the misunderstanding.

287
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:12,239
Thank you all for your concern.

288
00:19:12,239 --> 00:19:13,680
Thank you.

289
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,719
Miss Su, don't believe online rumors.

290
00:19:22,719 --> 00:19:25,140
You have to trust President Lu, all right?

291
00:19:28,219 --> 00:19:29,680
Can you understand me now?

292
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,980
We didn't do anything.

293
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,020
They are making a fuss over nothing.

294
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:38,979
But... I can promise you

295
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:42,800
this will never happen again, okay?

296
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,881
Shen Yue Chuan, pull over!

297
00:19:47,881 --> 00:19:50,458
Miss Su, we are currently on the way to Yong'an.

298
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,779
- We are on the highway, I can't pull over right now.
- What?

299
00:19:52,779 --> 00:19:54,560
A few days ago, President Lu returned

300
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,875
right after he found out about your hospitalization,

301
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,499
despite all the meetings he had to attend.

302
00:19:58,499 --> 00:20:02,179
Our partners at Yong'an gave President Lu one last chance.

303
00:20:02,179 --> 00:20:04,820
If we delay the negotiation again, we are going to suffer a big loss!

304
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,959
Yue Chuan, focus on driving.

305
00:20:10,699 --> 00:20:13,099
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

306
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,879
Xiao Xi, you are so cruel!

307
00:20:24,879 --> 00:20:26,480
You've completely recovered but refuse to leave.

308
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,240
You are wasting medical resources!

309
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,220
You are not a doctor! This is none of your business!

310
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:32,180
Do you still want to talk back?

311
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:35,600
Would you listen to me if I punched you twice?

312
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:40,300
Luo Xiao Xi!

313
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,760
Luo Xiao Xi, you...

314
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,939
Why did you bring me here?

315
00:21:04,939 --> 00:21:06,599
You have a business negotiation now, don't you?

316
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:07,381
That is right.

317
00:21:07,381 --> 00:21:09,021
I am here for a negotiation.

318
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:11,518
President Lu, it's good to see you again.

319
00:21:11,518 --> 00:21:14,240
This lady is your wife, isn't she?

320
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,600
Yes.

321
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,759
President Lu, you left in a hurry last time.

322
00:21:17,759 --> 00:21:20,019
Is your wife feeling better now?

323
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,100
She is fine.

324
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,619
Jian'an, let me do the introductions.

325
00:21:23,619 --> 00:21:25,720
These are Mr. and Mrs. Chen of Henghui,

326
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,159
and Mr. and Mrs. Li of Yuanguang.

327
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:28,359
Nice to meet you.

328
00:21:28,359 --> 00:21:29,959
Nice to meet you, too.

329
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:32,699
Look! He is such a considerate husband.

330
00:21:32,699 --> 00:21:34,919
You only care about work all day long.

331
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,780
Okay, okay.

332
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,659
I will learn from President Lu in the future,

333
00:21:37,659 --> 00:21:40,060
and I will spend more time with you, okay?

334
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,359
Let's get started.

335
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:42,580
All right.

336
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,980
Please.

337
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:45,939
Let's make a bet.

338
00:21:45,939 --> 00:21:47,100
Whoever wins treats everyone to dinner.

339
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,080
Sure, no problem!

340
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,620
Nice shot! Nice shot!

341
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,599
Nice swing!

342
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,425
Nice shot!

343
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,760
President Lu has a good figure.

344
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,080
He is also handsome and considerate to his wife.

345
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,819
Mrs. Lu, you are so lucky.

346
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:15,300
Thank you.

347
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:18,649
Mrs. Lu, you truly live up to your reputation. Not only are you beautiful,

348
00:22:18,649 --> 00:22:19,939
but also such a good writer.

349
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:23,480
No wonder President Lu can drop all business for his wife!

350
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,680
Did you read my novel?

351
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:28,359
Of course, President Lu recommended it to us.

352
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,960
I'm even beginning to miss my first love.

353
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,060
Really?

354
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:35,680
In the novel, you are childhood sweethearts.

355
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,760
It's just a novel. It's not real.

356
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:41,125
But my mother has known his mother since we were children.

357
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:43,320
We also went to the same junior high school.

358
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,880
I told you, they are indeed childhood sweethearts!

359
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,319
But then he transferred schools.

360
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,159
We haven't seen each other for years.

361
00:22:51,159 --> 00:22:52,960
And you both met again later on.

362
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,499
You are really a match made in heaven!

363
00:22:56,499 --> 00:22:58,380
What are you talking about so happily?

364
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,040
We're talking about your wife's novel.

365
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:03,535
You have been destined to be together since childhood.

366
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:04,724
That is correct.

367
00:23:04,725 --> 00:23:06,085
Well, would you like to play?

368
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:07,879
I don't know how to play golf.

369
00:23:07,879 --> 00:23:09,480
Then you need to learn it.

370
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,819
Look at Li! He doesn't care about me at all.

371
00:23:11,819 --> 00:23:14,240
You two can go first.

372
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,619
Let's go.

373
00:23:40,879 --> 00:23:42,680
Concentrate.

374
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,480
Spread your feet.

375
00:23:45,879 --> 00:23:48,000
Straighten your waist,

376
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:51,319
and slightly raise your buttocks.

377
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:59,179
Thank you.

378
00:23:59,179 --> 00:24:01,080
What for?

379
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:04,599
Without you, I wouldn't get business done so quickly.

380
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,900
Nice shot!

381
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,275
- See, she is talented.
- President Lu, let's cooperate well.

382
00:24:27,275 --> 00:24:30,499
- Mrs. Lu, you learned the necessary skills so soon!
- President Lu, you've improved a lot!

383
00:24:30,499 --> 00:24:32,798
- See you next time.
- All right, see you next time.

384
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,279
- All right. Bye bye.
- Bye bye.

385
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:36,479
Mrs. Lu, see you next time.

386
00:24:36,479 --> 00:24:37,719
Okay.

387
00:24:37,719 --> 00:24:39,419
- All right, bye bye!
- Bye bye!

388
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,739
Wonderful.

389
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,099
Mission accomplished! Can we go back now?

390
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:50,940
Not yet.

391
00:24:51,499 --> 00:24:53,540
We have to go somewhere else first.

392
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,879
- That's...
- Yes.

393
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:18,080
- Have you remembered?
- Yes.

394
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:21,040
Gather around!

395
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,979
Children, we will assemble here in one hour.

396
00:25:24,979 --> 00:25:26,719
Now, enjoy yourselves!

397
00:25:26,719 --> 00:25:28,439
Great!

398
00:25:28,439 --> 00:25:29,720
Be careful, okay?

399
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,620
All right!

400
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,960
Don't run around too much, all right?
[Zhengzhou Ferris Wheel]

401
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,700
- Do you want to ride this?
- Yes.

402
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:45,119
You can't ride this, though!

403
00:25:45,119 --> 00:25:46,119
Why not?

404
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,700
I just went to buy a ticket,

405
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:49,159
but they wouldn't sell it to me!

406
00:25:49,159 --> 00:25:51,179
Why wouldn't they sell it?

407
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,259
Because you are too fat!

408
00:25:54,259 --> 00:25:55,820
If the Ferris wheel collapses because of you,

409
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,019
I will have to compensate them!

410
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:01,600
You are too thin. I hate you!

411
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,580
Don't go! I was just kidding!
[Zhengzhou Ferris wheel]

412
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,500
I couldn't have a ride on the Ferris wheel because of you.

413
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:11,240
So... I will make it up to you today.

414

All right,

we are even now! You are paying for your wrongs today.

Lovers can't ride the Ferris wheel

Lu Bo Yan,

443
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,620
I need sanitary napkins!

444
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,799
What should I do? How should I tell him?

445
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:26,550
How about this?

446
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:27,979
I'll make some brown sugar water for you.

447
00:29:27,979 --> 00:29:29,579
Wait for me.

448
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,380
No!

449
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,600
Just wait for me.

450
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:43,440
It's so late! Who could it be?

451
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:01,280
Jian'an, this one is made of cotton.

452
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,179
It's softer than the standard ones.

453
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:05,620
And this one...

454
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:06,820
This one is also made of cotton,

455
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:08,439
but it's thinner and more breathable.

456
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,019
And this one is elongated;

457
00:30:11,019 --> 00:30:13,179
it can avoid side leaking.

458
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:15,999
You will be able to sleep well with it.

00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:46,919
No...

462

That Lu Bo Yan...

463
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,379
When did he become so considerate?

464
00:30:50,379 --> 00:30:52,380
Lu Bo Yan is a devil!

465
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:54,459
You mustn't be fooled.

466
00:30:54,459 --> 00:30:56,474
You can't trust him!

467
00:30:56,474 --> 00:30:59,480
It's so rare to meet a wonderful man like him in this world.

468
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,860
He is so great!

469
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,259
It's now or never!

470
00:31:03,259 --> 00:31:04,939
He has been cunning and scheming since childhood!

471
00:31:04,939 --> 00:31:06,580
He even knows so much about sanitary napkins.

472
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:08,259
He's a pervert!

473
00:31:08,259 --> 00:31:10,278
He is a president!

474
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:14,459
He is so considerate! This is too good to be true!

475
00:31:14,459 --> 00:31:17,340
He's been acting from the very beginning.

476
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,540
These are all traps!

477
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,100
They are sweet traps!

478
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,359
Love traps!

479
00:31:22,359 --> 00:31:25,259
So many girls barely get such a chance!

480
00:31:25,259 --> 00:31:27,179
Jian'an, listen to me!

481
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:28,939
Stay away from Lu Bo Yan!

482
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:30,340
Listen to me!

483
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:34,118
His gentle lips and solid abs...

484
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:37,560
You possess this beautiful man now!

485
00:31:38,699 --> 00:31:39,939
Su Jian'an,

486
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,280
have you fallen asleep inside?

487
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,560
Not at all!

488
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:11,860
Drink this while it's still warm.

489
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:19,119
Thank you.

490
00:32:21,699 --> 00:32:23,599
How are you feeling?

491
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:25,440
Does it still hurt?

492
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:37,219
What do you want?

493
00:32:37,219 --> 00:32:39,839
My hands are warm. I'll rub it for you.

494
00:32:52,019 --> 00:32:54,980
How is it? Are you feeling any better?

495
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,460
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

496
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,900
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

497
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:09,560
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

498
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:10,700
♫ Yes ♫

499
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,390
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

500
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:17,760
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

501
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:21,260
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

502
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:24,890
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

503
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:27,670
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

504
00:33:27,670 --> 00:33:32,130
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive the signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

505
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,790
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

506
00:33:35,790 --> 00:33:39,630
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

507
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:42,670
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

508
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:47,900
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

509
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,870
♫ The concern of leaving the light on ♫

510
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:21,160
♫ Cannot be compared with the love of your embrace. ♫

511
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:25,520
♫ Only you can cure me ♫

512
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:29,670
♫ No matter if you have a chubby or skinny appearance ♫

513
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:34,030
♫ I just want to hold you tight ♫

514
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:55,800
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

515
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,200
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

516
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,840
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

517
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,980
♫ Yes ♫

518
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:06,680
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

519
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:11,010
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

520
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,460
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

521
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:18,280
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

522
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,970
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

523
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:23,680
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

524
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,520

♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

528
00:35:35,950 --> 00:35:41,820
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

529
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:45,450
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

530
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,310
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

531
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,030
♫ Warning all problems ♫

532
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:52,680
♫ To stay away from us ♫

533
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,360
♫ No one can take my place ♫

534
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,220
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

535
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:03,300
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

536
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:09,500
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
