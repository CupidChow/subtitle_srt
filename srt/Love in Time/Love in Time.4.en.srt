00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,099
It is okay. I will stay with you.

333
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,159
I feel much better.

334
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:22,939
Thank you.

335
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:29,160
By the way, I'm very sorry for the trick I played just now.

336
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,879
Do I hear you correctly?

337
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:34,780
Is the famous President Lu apologizing to me?

338
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,440
All right.

339
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,100
I accept your apology.

340
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,599
- I am happy today.
- Are you feeling better?

341
00:30:56,680 --> 00:31:01,480
I thought you wouldn't like this.

342
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:06,300
Actually... I haven't been this relaxed for a long time.

343
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,960
Really?

344
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,159
This is my first time here, too.

345
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,759
Thank you for today.

346
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,920
Lu Bo Yan, what are you doing?

347
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:19,159
Let me go!

348
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,880
Lu Bo Yan,

349
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,558
are you afraid of the dark?

350
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,259
No. No.

351
00:31:58,279 --> 00:31:59,879
Bo Yan!
[Taxi]

352
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,199
What is this?

353
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:40,739
I knew it. My instinct wouldn't deceive me.

354
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:44,019
He has kept it from me for so long.

355
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,360
How are you feeling now?

356
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:59,659
Are you worried about me now?

357
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,920
Should I take you to the hospital?

358
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,720
There's no need.

359
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:17,079
♫  Don't want to say anything, afraid that the tears will systematically follow  ♫

360
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,859
Give me your hand.

361

- What?
- Give me your hand.

362
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:26,750
