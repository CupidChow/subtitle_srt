18
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:28,819
Aunt Jiang bought a new vacuum cleaner. I am trying it out.

- It cleans well, and it is convenient to use!

Okay, Dad.

Do you know what?

57
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:37,140
When my mother was alive,

58
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,299
this balcony was always full of flowers.

59
00:03:39,299 --> 00:03:41,440
She loved plants.

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,219
They were everywhere making everything so colorful.

61
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,550
But after Aunt Jiang arrived,

62
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:51,620
the traces of my mother faded away.

63
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:55,059
When did Aunt Jiang meet Dad?

64
00:03:55,059 --> 00:03:57,139
She was a senior employee of our company.

65
00:03:57,139 --> 00:03:59,360
Her husband died of some disease.

66
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,800
They are fellow sufferers.

67
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:06,280
Then she married my father and brought her daughter, Su Yuan Yuan.

68

Why hasn't he bought a big diamond ring for Jian'an?

72
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,159
As long as they are happy,

73
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,019
why bother about a big diamond ring or bicycles?

74
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:30,699
Oh, quit it!

75
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:32,500
I am worried because

76
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,500
Lu Bo Yan is surrounded by celebrities and debutantes.

77
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,479
I'm afraid he will take advantage of Jian'an.

78
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:42,640
Didn't he have a scandal with Han Ruo Xi not too long ago?

86
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:09,204
Well, I thought of the same thing we did last time:

87
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:12,378
Introduce the company's development history, deliver a speech,

88
00:05:12,378 --> 00:05:14,719
invite some stars for the atmosphere,

89
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,279
then it is all about eating and drinking.

90
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:20,480
I think we should try something new this time.

91
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,880
This is all so old-fashioned.

92
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,260
Actually, all companies have similar procedures.

93
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:30,740
Then you think about it for me. Do you have any new ideas?

94
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:32,400
I'm wondering...

95
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,130
if we could make the anniversary... more dynamic.

96
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,640

I-I don't know.

168
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,520
It is on their program!

169
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:43,090
[Twentieth anniversary of Su's Beauty]

170
00:11:43,090 --> 00:11:45,159
Sister, would you like some coffee?

171
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:46,660
I will buy it for you!

172
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,200
Lu Bo Yan, what do you want?

173
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,150
Do you remember now?

174
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:36,660
You don't remember, do you?

175
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,560
I will teach you again.

176
00:14:41,825 --> 00:14:45,725
President Lu, there are some things you should take care of.

177
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,520
Practice obediently by yourself here.

178
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:51,359
I will come back to check the results.

179
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:15,339
Finally, I can take a break.

180
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:20,999
The twentieth anniversary of Su's Beauty will be held soon.

181
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:22,278
According to our sources,

182
00:15:22,278 --> 00:15:26,119
they also invited popular star, Han Ruo Xi, to attend the event.

183
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:30,820
As we all know, Lu Bo Yan and Han Ruo Xi had a long-standing relationship.

184
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:33,159
But Lu Bo Yan married Su Jian'an,

185
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,659
the daughter of Su's Beauty's President.

186
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,720
It is quite shocking.

187
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:40,539
This love triangle is very confusing.

188
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:44,440
The relationship between Han Ruo Xi and Su Jian'an is very tense.

189
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,320
They even provoked each other multiple times in secret.

190
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,360
What kind of random things are these?

191
00:15:50,379 --> 00:15:52,630
Miss Su, don't you think that

192
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,520
what was said in the report just now is very accurate?

193
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,320
I have a bad feeling...

194
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,720
Miss Han, when did you arrive?

195
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,220
I just came to see how Miss Su's dance rehearsal is going.

196
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:09,100
I might not have the talent to do this.

197
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:12,450
This dance is just like the relationship between two people.

198
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:15,399
You can't possibly build a solid foundation in just one or two days.

199
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:18,180
I recommend you give up.

200
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,210
Furthermore, you should remember that if you dance with Bo Yan,

201
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:23,650
you may destroy his image.

202
00:16:25,425 --> 00:16:29,840
Originally, the idea of dancing pas de deux (dance duet) was Lu Bo Yan's proposal.

203
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,080
He insisted that I should dance.

204
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,779
I have no choice.

205
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:35,300
Do you have an idea how many years Lu Bo Yan and I

206
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,770
have struggled together?

207
00:16:37,770 --> 00:16:39,740
We are a couple.

208
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,220
I think you should know this.

209
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:45,060
Then why aren't you his dancing partner?

210
00:16:50,479 --> 00:16:51,759
All right.

211
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,539
Miss Su, see you at the anniversary.

212
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:05,025
- Did she really say that?
- Yes.

213
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,860
It is a blatant threat!

214
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:10,450
Tell your husband to blacklist her!

215
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:13,819
I will dance on the anniversary of my dad's company.

216
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:16,480
Why does it irritate her?

217
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,900
I think she incited the cyber manhunt,

218
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:22,679
then the hotel scandal, and told you to run away from home!

219
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:23,850
You're right!

220
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:26,638
Villains in novels are just like this.

221
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:29,619
Su Jian'an, stop your analyzing!

222
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:33,400
Let me tell you, your battle has begun!

223
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,840
I have an ominous hunch anyway.

224
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,940
Jian'an!

225
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:40,060
You can't be merciful to her!

226
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:42,179
It is okay. You have me anyway.

227
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:44,880
I will help you.

228
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,059
Jian'an, cheer up!

229
00:17:47,059 --> 00:17:48,459
Get ready to fight!

230
00:17:48,459 --> 00:17:50,059
But I don't want to fight.

231
00:17:50,059 --> 00:17:52,481
Enough, enough. I need to write my novel now.

232
00:17:52,481 --> 00:17:54,160
- What?
- Goodbye.

233
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,040
- Wait. Have you picked your dress?
- Not yet.

234
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:59,059
Neither did I. We can go together another day.

235
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:02,319
You should cheer up!

236
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,440
I'm so furious.

237
00:18:07,439 --> 00:18:10,020
I should find a dancing partner!

None of your business!

Don't be so ungrateful after you are full!

Have you found a dance partner for Su's anniversary event yet?

Is it the dress design for the anniversary?

259

Yes, pick the one you like.

If you don't like any of them, I will tell them to design more, okay?

Xiao Xi, how does it look?

333
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:18,099
Oh my gosh!

334
00:24:18,099 --> 00:24:20,660
Jian'an, you are so beautiful, amazing!

335
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:23,780
You are the queen of the prom! Buy it!

336
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,874
Oh, I'm sorry, you already bought it!

337
00:24:26,875 --> 00:24:28,319
Be quiet!

338
00:24:28,319 --> 00:24:30,838
Jian'an, your dress is so beautiful!

339
00:24:30,839 --> 00:24:32,740
My desire has been aroused now.

340
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,299
Please take me to try on dresses.

341
00:24:34,299 --> 00:24:36,580
Miss Luo, please.

342
00:24:37,379 --> 00:24:40,260
Mrs. Lu, how is it?

343
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,240
It is perfect.

344
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:05,480
Mrs. Lu, how was it?

345
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,040
Would you like any adjustments?

346
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,461
It is great. Thank you.

347
00:25:08,461 --> 00:25:10,105
We will send it to your home tomorrow

348
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:12,640
- after a few minor embellishments.
- Yes.

349
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,359
Please take a seat.

350
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,799
Miss Han.

351
00:25:24,859 --> 00:25:27,019
What a coincidence, Miss Su!

352
00:25:27,019 --> 00:25:29,320
You are here, too!

353
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:31,700
Why aren't you greeting me?

354
00:25:32,975 --> 00:25:35,560
Are we friends? Why do I have to greet you?

355
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:36,919
And I am married.

356
00:25:36,919 --> 00:25:39,239
My husband's last name is Lu.

357
00:25:39,239 --> 00:25:41,999
Please call me Mrs. Lu.

358
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,640
I'm sorry,

359
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,439
I can't do that now.

360
00:25:46,439 --> 00:25:48,439
And anyway,

361
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:53,099
you will get divorced in a year.

362
00:25:53,099 --> 00:25:55,739
Do I really need to call you that?

363
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,650
As long as we haven't divorced, I am still legally his wife.

364
00:26:05,539 --> 00:26:06,779
Su Jian'an,

365
00:26:06,779 --> 00:26:11,419
it is not a big deal that you married Lu Bo Yan because of your family.

366
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:12,719
I can tell you,

367
00:26:12,719 --> 00:26:15,780
I have worked with Lu Bo Yan for so many years.

368
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:16,760
You are nothing!

369
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:18,850
But I'm the one who married Lu Bo Yan.

370
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,800
You lost the moment we got married.

371
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:31,140
Who loses and who wins is not always certain.

372
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:33,290
I know Bo Yan.

373
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,900
If he really wants to be with you,

374
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:39,250
he will give you a diamond ring.

375
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:44,175
I think you better wait for a year before making a statement.

376
00:26:44,175 --> 00:26:46,595
Maybe it won't need a year.

377
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,760
We will wait and see.

378
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:58,540
Just this one. Help me check if there are any problems.

379
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,939
- Okay.
- Thank you.

380
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,559
Jian'an!

381
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:09,180
Do you smell something?

382
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,540
Something b*tchy.

383
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:18,060
- Who are you talking about?
- Did I say it was you?

384
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,899
You plague President Lu in public.

385
00:27:19,899 --> 00:27:21,358
Worse, you deliberately took pictures.

386
00:27:21,358 --> 00:27:25,518
You're so pretentious! No wonder you're a famous actress.

387
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,718
Who do you think you are?

388
00:27:27,718 --> 00:27:29,939
I'm talking to Su Jian'an. This is none of your business.

389
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,938
It is Jian'an and President Lu's business. This is none of your business!

390
00:27:32,938 --> 00:27:36,320
Just leave her husband alone!

391
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,859
Let's go, Jian'an!

392
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,059
Goodbye!

393
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,379
No need to see us out!

394
00:27:52,059 --> 00:27:53,618
Great, Jian'an!

395
00:27:53,618 --> 00:27:56,739
You used to keep your head down and never spoke in such situations,

396
00:27:56,739 --> 00:27:59,519
but now you dared to challenge her!

397
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:06,008
After getting married to Lu Bo Yan, I've learned nothing but anti-pressure ability.

398
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:17,958
Miss Han, are you sure you want to make these changes?

399
00:28:17,958 --> 00:28:20,179
Yes, do as I said.

400
00:28:20,179 --> 00:28:24,359
Tomorrow afternoon, send it to my assistant.

401
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,899
It will be a good show.

Come, come, come.

- Bottoms up!
- Drink it up!

406

Good job!

407

I have rough luck tonight. I need some air now!

408

- I will come back later.
- Go, go!

- I won't go.

Hello there, Handsome Guy.

Are you drinking alone?

Would you like to drink with me?

All right!

417

Dude, give her a mojito.

Nothing.

Wait, I will pay the bill. I have to go now.

Take it seriously?

Good evening, everyone.

428
00:30:28,674 --> 00:30:33,149
The twentieth anniversary of Su's Beauty Group is about to begin.

429
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:36,538
Guests and friends are now arriving.

430
00:30:36,538 --> 00:30:42,399
Famous actress and Su's Beauty's spokesperson, Miss Han Ruo Xi, has arrived!

431
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,340
- Excuse me!
- Han Ruo Xi!

432
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:04,280
Miss Han, could I ask you a few questions?

433
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:06,499
You rarely wear red dresses to events.

434
00:31:06,499 --> 00:31:08,739
Why did you choose red this time?

435
00:31:08,739 --> 00:31:13,359
Red was the color of my first Su's Beauty lingerie ad,

436
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:15,818
and Bo Yan specially chose it for me.

437
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:19,140
So I think it is very meaningful.

438
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:27,479
It is Lu Bo Yan!

439
00:31:27,479 --> 00:31:30,380
Mrs. Lu is here!

440
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,119
It is the same color!

441
00:31:35,119 --> 00:31:37,558
Dress clash!

442
00:31:37,558 --> 00:31:39,459
They're wearing similar styles

443
00:31:42,579 --> 00:31:44,739
and the same color!

444
00:31:44,739 --> 00:31:47,240
Take pictures! Go, go, go.

445
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:50,800
Mrs. Lu, you and Ms. Han have a clash of outfits. Do you mind it?

446
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,800
Mrs. Lu, Miss Han said she chose red because President Lu chose it for her.

447
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,400
Why did you also choose red?

448
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,025
It is because Bo Yan knew the first lingerie set of Su's Beauty was red.

449
00:32:03,025 --> 00:32:04,979
I'm very thankful for Miss Han's cooperation.

450
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:10,299
Mrs. Lu, between you and Miss Han, who looks better in red?

451
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:13,075
The answer varies from person to person.

452
00:32:13,075 --> 00:32:15,759
President Lu, what do you think?

453
00:32:15,759 --> 00:32:17,379
Jian'an is right,

454
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:22,511
but this dress is tailor-made by my friend, Sophia.

455
00:32:22,511 --> 00:32:26,384
Sophia insists on integrating her designs with the model's character.

456
00:32:26,384 --> 00:32:30,850
If Miss Han is in need of any help, I could introduce her.

Excuse us.

- Well done.
- I can't love your face (dignity)!

460
00:32:42,099 --> 00:32:44,340
Miss Han, did you hear President Lu's answer?

461
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:47,349
What is your response to it? Miss Han.

462

00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,470
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

496
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:39,910
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

497
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:43,730
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

498
00:35:43,730 --> 00:35:46,460
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

499
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:49,210
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

500
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,930
♫ The signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

501
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:54,610
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

502
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:58,400
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

503
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,450
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

504
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:07,240
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

505
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,950
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

506
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:13,720
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

507
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,460
♫ Warning all problems ♫

508
00:36:16,460 --> 00:36:18,270
♫ To stay away from us ♫

509
00:36:18,270 --> 00:36:21,880
♫ No one can take my place ♫

510
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,590
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

511
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:28,730
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

512
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:34,870
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
