Is he with Han Ruo Xi?

162
00:16:04,759 --> 00:16:07,059
Jiang Shao Kai!

163
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,580
Come on.

164
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,679
That's enough.

165

Stop it.

166
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,959
I asked you to come here to make Jian'an happy.

167
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,579
Did you forget your task?

168
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:33,640
Why is it my task? It is also your task, okay?

169
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,520
Stop talking nonsense. Hurry up and fulfil your task!

170
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,079
All right. Watch this.

171
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,719
Jian'an! Aren't I like seaweed?

172
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,359
- Jian'an.
- No.

173
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,040
Be happy.

174
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,020
Seaweed. Seaweed. Seaweed.

175
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:12,220
Jian'an, if your top was this big,

176
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,620
Lu Bo Yan wouldn't leave you.

177
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,000
I'm different. I like you just the way you are.

Or you can get breast implants.

179

A**hole! I am flattening your big breasts.

184
00:17:37,319 --> 00:17:39,019
Don't run!

185

Wow! There's so much. Jian'an, did you rob the supermarket?

191
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,440
Help yourselves. It is not my money anyway.

192
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:08,159
This one is good. Jian'an, here.

Jian'an, which one do you want?

199

- Here.
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

204
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:47,140
Great. Have some snacks.

205
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:50,720
This is the best. It is for Jian'an.

206
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,199

- Jian'an, are you okay?
- What?

211
00:19:20,499 --> 00:19:22,199
Oh, I am fine.

212
00:19:23,825 --> 00:19:27,280
Jian'an, why don't you consider me?

213
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,699
Why Lu Bo Yan? He is only a little richer... and more handsome than me.

214
00:19:32,699 --> 00:19:34,280
He is no better than me.

215
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,760
Jiang Shao Kai, can you be self-aware?

216
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,520
He is taller than you.

217
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:39,800
He graduated from a prestigious university.

218
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,119
Right. He can speak three languages.

219

- And—
- Stop! What's wrong with you two?

220

Luo Xiao Xi, why do you antagonize me all the time?

221
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,260
- You can't eat now! I won't let you.
- Hey!

00:19:51,959 --> 00:19:53,720
- What?
- How dare you!

223
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:55,720
No, no, no. I'm sorry. Stop, stop, stop.

224
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,520
Sorry, I was wrong.

225
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,280
Jiang Shao Kai, I think only Luo Xiao Xi can teach you a lesson.

226
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:05,259
I don't want to. He is so weak.

227
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,879
Hey! Meteors.

228
00:20:09,879 --> 00:20:12,119
Jian'an, come, make a wish.

229
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:17,299
I wish Lu Bo Yan will never bother me again!

230
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:29,559
Wow! Phytoncide (aroma emitted by the forest).

231
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:32,079
So great.

232
00:20:32,079 --> 00:20:34,775
You two, keep up! You're so slow.

233
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:38,159
I'm always staying at home so it's hard to walk around,

234
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,559
- but I feel much better now.
- That's good to know.

235
00:20:42,019 --> 00:20:45,399
You have your own jobs and careers,

236
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:49,200
but I have nothing to do all day. I don't know what to do.

237
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,919
Xiao Xi, I remember you performed a play in college.

238
00:20:52,919 --> 00:20:55,079
You told me you liked acting.

239
00:20:55,079 --> 00:20:56,839
Yes, I liked it.

240
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,720
If you like it, why not continue?

241
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,040
I think you can consider it.

242
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:06,279
Acting was not my major. Just forget it.

243
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,680
You are so slow.

244
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,900
I really can't go anymore. I need some rest.

245
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,699
Xiao Xi, we will get to the top of the mountain soon.

246
00:21:17,699 --> 00:21:19,200
You should hold on for a while. Okay?

247
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,820
I need a break. I really can't stand it.

Go. Hold on.

Hey, snake!

251
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:40,100
- It is fake.
- Just wait and see when we get to the top of the mountain!

252
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:43,159
I only wanted to spice things up.

- No, no, wait!

265
00:22:28,359 --> 00:22:30,719

Okay. Wait here.

Wait a moment! I will take a look.

We will meet again in the afterlife.

274
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,979
You will be fine. Okay?

Okay. Be careful.

What do you have to tell me?

283
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,800
Xiao Xi, I am sorry for quarreling with you before.

284

But from the moment you tried to suck out the venom,

I knew you were my good friend.

Okay. I promise you.

Get well soon.

325
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:49,760
Be gentle. A snake didn't bite me to death, but you beat me to death.

326
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,120
Shao Kai, you should take a good rest.

I will ask the president to give you leave.

329
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,599
Jian'an is the best.

330
00:25:57,599 --> 00:25:59,480
As for someone else, not so much.

331
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,719
How great!

Jian'an, it is so great to see you here.

334
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,800
I made this especially for you.

335
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,760
- Eat while it is warm.
- Did you make all this?

336
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,499
Of course.

337
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,998
Come. Try it.

338

My hand hurts. I don't have any strength.

339
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,999
Jian'an, help me.

340
00:26:37,839 --> 00:26:39,339
Come.

Okay.

344
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,040
Jian'an, where are you injured?

345
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,678
- I am not injured.
- Come home with me.

Mrs. Lu, have you forgotten your identity?

350
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,040
I'm taking care of my friend. It is none of your business.

351
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:28,660
I will say it once again. Come home with me.

352
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,280
You have no right to give me an order.

353

I never interfere with your dealings with others.

Please don't intervene in my life.

355
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,640
Well now, if it isn't President Lu.

356
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,298
Why in all this time have you not thought about our Jian'an, and you didn't worry until now?

357
00:27:41,298 --> 00:27:44,179
This is the hospital. Don't make noise. It affects the patient's rest.

Nine o'clock. You must go home by nine o'clock.

Jian'an, you are right. You can't be merciful to him.

360
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,319
You are fine now. You can be discharged.

361
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:05,800
Doctor, I am uncomfortable.

362
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,040
I feel so tired. I can't be discharged now.

363
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:12,425
You only feel uncomfortable because you got too much rest.

364
00:28:12,425 --> 00:28:16,299
So I should stay in the hospital for more observation.

365
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,680
Jian'an, don't be upset.
