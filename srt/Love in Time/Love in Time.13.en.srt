Bo Yan,

13
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,240
I thought you went to work!

14
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:15,919
What are you doing here?

15
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,680
Mrs. Lu, President Lu prepared your transport for you.

16
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,539
Come,

17
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:26,419
I will show you around.

18
00:01:28,819 --> 00:01:30,519
Be careful.

19
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,319
This is the meeting area.

20
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,280
You can work here while you are away.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,459
This is the cooking area.

22
00:01:39,459 --> 00:01:42,950
You can make a delicious meal here, even in the wilderness.

23
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:45,000
This is the bathroom.

24

Mrs. Lu, this is Nanny Cai.

25
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,400
She graduated from New Oriental Cooking School.

26
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,020
She has a senior technical title issued by the Ministry of Labor,

27
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,950
and is proficient in eight major cuisines. No matter where you go,

28
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:07,130
you can eat whatever you want.

29
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:09,040
Greetings, Mrs. Lu.

30
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,479
Hello.

31
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,079
This is Xiao Yong.

32
00:02:12,079 --> 00:02:15,039
He is your driver and bodyguard.

33
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,259
He is a special forces veteran,

34
00:02:16,259 --> 00:02:18,918
who has been working as a security guard in Lu's Media.

35
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:21,259
His fighting, driving, reconnaissance,

36
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:24,280
and anti-reconnaissance capabilities are first-class.

37
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,638
He will protect you twenty-four hours a day.

38
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,439
Greetings, Mrs. Lu.

39
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,259
Hello.

40
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:39,060
President Lu booked a first-class ticket for you.

41
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,719
We will now go our separate ways.

42
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,158
Our car will leave first,

43
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:47,099
and Mrs. Lu will go by airplane later.

44
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:49,638
We will meet at Luochuan Airport.

45
00:02:49,639 --> 00:02:52,980
Then we will drive you to the crew's hotel.

46
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:59,539
Bo Yan, what is all this?

47
00:02:59,539 --> 00:03:01,539
It is a superstar's treatment!

48
00:03:01,539 --> 00:03:03,240
It is just the basic minimum!

49
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,579
If you do this much, how am I supposed I work with the crew?

50
00:03:06,579 --> 00:03:08,959
We agreed to keep a low profile!

51
00:03:09,759 --> 00:03:11,419
You need an RV (Recreational Vehicle) at least, don't you?

52
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:12,878
The crew will have their own vehicles.

53
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,020
- You need the chef.
- The crew will have their own meals.

54
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,700
You will be alone outside so

55
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,239
you will at least need a bodyguard.

56
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,599
I have Luo Xiao Xi.

57
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:30,060
I will compensate you well after I come back.

58
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,119
Okay.

59
00:03:32,119 --> 00:03:34,420
Then I will have the final say on how

60
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,740
you will compensate me.

61
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,960
You—

62
00:03:41,701 --> 00:03:43,859
All right, my wife wants to keep a low profile.

63
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:46,419
You can all leave now. I will pay you the same.

64
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:47,719
Thank you, President Lu.

65
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,599
- Please, follow me.
- All right.

66
00:03:54,561 --> 00:03:56,625
Bo Yan, we need to have an agreement.

67
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,220
You can't suddenly come to see me.

68
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,090
You can't do a background check on the crew.

69
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:02,578
And don't even think of investing in the crew!

70
00:04:02,578 --> 00:04:06,760
Or else, I will be the privileged one.

71
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,660
You think too much.

72
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,024
You have to promise me

73
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:13,980
that I will be the first one to know if something happens to you.

74
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,099
Don't worry, I have Luo Xiao Xi!

75
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:18,599
Pinkie swear?

76
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:22,540
Deal!

77
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,220
Oh, by the way,

78
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:27,839
it is not convenient for me to wear this ring there.

79
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:30,700
You should keep it for me temporarily.

80
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,300
Absolutely not. Put it back on.

81
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,260
We agreed not to expose our identity!

82
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,099
Fine.

83
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,919
I will drive you to the station,

84
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,620
okay?

85
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,180
Let's go.

86
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,140
Okay, this is where I leave you.

87
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:13,120
- You should go to work now.
- Okay.

88
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,400
Take care of yourself,

89
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,360
take your stomach medicine on time,

90
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:18,139
- and wait for me to return.
- All right.

91
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,280
I'm leaving.

92
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,999
Bye bye!

93
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,520
Have a safe journey.

94
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:12,060
I am going to leave.

95
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,819
Don't you have anything to tell me?

96
00:06:15,819 --> 00:06:17,339
Go to bed and get up early.

97
00:06:17,339 --> 00:06:19,659
Drink more water. Eat more.

98
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:22,559
Drink less alcohol. Don't stay up late.

99
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:24,400
Is that all?

100
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,019
Don't miss me.

101
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,760
After I leave, you need to behave! Do you understand me?

102
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:41,979
Yes, yes, I do understand!

103
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,940
That's the spirit!

104
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:49,038
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye.

105
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:52,859
- Xiao Xi!
- Jian'an!

106
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,380
Why are you here so early?

107
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,580
I was waiting for you here.

108
00:06:58,179 --> 00:07:00,400
- Let's go!
- Go!

[Welcome to the crew of "When Time Stops"]

110
00:07:07,001 --> 00:07:09,060
Ladies, please. I'm the life producer.

111
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,339
Just call me "Juvenile."

112
00:07:10,339 --> 00:07:14,140
"Juvenile"? He is in his mid-thirties!

113
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,920
Miss Su, this is your room.

114
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,359
Xiao Xi, this is your room.

115
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,559
Here, these are your room cards.

- Thank you!

Bye bye, Juvenile!

120
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,100
This is so nice!

121
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:03,679
Crew life has finally begun!

122
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,839
Jian'an, the revised script is great!

123
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:16,919
I like it!

124
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,121
Thank you, Director Guo.

125
00:08:18,121 --> 00:08:20,219
All right. I will take you to see the other producers.

126
00:08:20,219 --> 00:08:22,339
- Let's go. Bring my cup along.
- All right.

127

128
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,819
Director!

Let me do the introductions.

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,180
This is our new screenwriter, Su Jian'an.

131
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,920
Jian'an, these are the two other screenwriters, Jing Jing and Xiao Min.

132
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,439
Come, come. Let's all work together!

133
00:08:39,439 --> 00:08:42,340
Hello, everyone, I am Su Jian'an. Nice to meet you!

134
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,400
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

135
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,800
I will introduce you to the leading actress.

136
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,820
- Director.
- Director.

137
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:52,940
Come, Jian'an. This is the leading actress, Han Ruo Xi.

138
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,359
Han Ruo Xi, this is our screenwriter, Su Jian'an.

139
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,819
Okay, you both can have a little talk.

140
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,740
You should tell her about your script revision.

141
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:01,299
She will cooperate with you.

142
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,158
Yu Tong helps Ling Feng escape to the roadside.

143

She unlocks a black car with her superpowers.

144
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,038
They get in the car and drive away,

145
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,479
disappearing into the night.

146
00:09:14,479 --> 00:09:17,639
Director Guo, what do you think of this revision?

147
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:20,640
- It is okay.
- Okay, I will continue.

148
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,120
Director Guo.

149
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,800
Why you didn't tell me about the script-reading?

150
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,959
Ruo Xi! It is good to see you here.

151
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,460
Please, have a seat.

152
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:28,940
Please sit.

153
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,118
Director Guo, I think there's a problem with the revision by Su Jian'an.

154
00:09:38,118 --> 00:09:40,218
- I just want a little change, okay?
- Sure, sure.

155
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:42,660
I also think it is a little too simple.

156
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,799
Fortunately, it is only a small change.

157
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,519
She means big changes!

158
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:49,200
We can't see the heroine's motive

159
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
so her character is too weak.

160
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,798
The character development is unclear.

161
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,579
What's the reason for her emotional change?

162
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:59,110
Take Nineteen. There is no sense of design.

163
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:00,480
You need to revise it again.

164
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,280
The heroine is so stupid. I can't act like this!

165
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:09,579
Director, I have no problems. Thank you, everyone.

00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,639
Action!

328
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,480
You are such a traitor! You are such a traitor!

329
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:51,380
You are such a traitor!

330
00:21:53,279 --> 00:21:57,440
Tell Dong Jun that one day, I will get even with him.

331
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,379
Cut! Pass, next scene!

332
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,039
Sorry. I got too immersed in my role.

333
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,739
Get ready for the next scene!

334
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:20,160
Xiao Xi, are you okay?

335
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:23,019
- Does it hurt?
- I'm fine!

336
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,319
Don't move.

337
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:34,179
No one has treated me like that since childhood!

338
00:22:34,179 --> 00:22:37,759
Han Ruo Xi slapped me!

339
00:22:37,759 --> 00:22:39,280
I'm going to kill her!

340
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,979
Okay, don't move. Be a good girl.

341
00:22:41,979 --> 00:22:44,459
Jian'an!

342
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:49,100
I'm allergic to lilies, don't you know that?

343
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,759
I have a plan.

344
00:22:51,759 --> 00:22:54,219
However, I need your cooperation.

345
00:23:08,319 --> 00:23:09,620
- Jian'an.
- Yes?

346
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:11,838
The crew is like a miniature version of this world.

347
00:23:11,839 --> 00:23:13,559
Just look on the bright side, okay?

348
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:14,798
Okay, thank you, Director Guo.

349
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,598
Director, whenever you are ready.

350
00:23:16,599 --> 00:23:19,118
Okay, go call Ruo Xi and Feng Feng.

351
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:21,240
- Yes, Director.
- Good.

352
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,960
Call the actors here!

353
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,900
Come, hurry!

354
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,839
Okay, Scene Five, Take One!

355
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,979
Three, two, one, action!

356
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:36,559
Did you want to see me?

357
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:40,599
Ruo Xue, I've decided to join the organization,

358
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,580
but not for noble ideals,

359
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:44,459
for you.

360
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,319
Whatever your motives are,

361
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:49,319
I'm very happy.

362
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,860
This is for you.

363
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,239
You are like this bouquet.

364
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:57,079
As beautiful as a rose and as pure as a lily.

365
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,480
Thank you.

366
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:19,720
Lilies? Who ordered this bouquet?

367
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,159
Makeup, I need makeup!

368
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,059
What is wrong?

369
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:29,280
My face!

370
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:43,100
Great!

371
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,119
Who changed Scene Forty-nine?

372
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,650
I did.

373
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:56,400
It is unnecessary. Delete it.

374
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,279
It is to expose the fact that Yu Tong is the sister of the villain, Dong Jun.

375
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,880
So Yu Tong needs to say this line.

376
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,580
I can't delete it.

377
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:07,419
Then I won't shoot it.

378
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,639
Sister Ruo Xi, don't make trouble.

379
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,179
Just because you wanted to revise the script,

380
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,650
we have barely finished one-third of the filming.

381
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:18,300
If you revise this now, we will have to re-shoot the previous scenes.

382
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:22,939
Director Guo, I revised it for the benefit of the movie.

383
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:25,999
Can Su Jian'an not even revise the script?

384
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,880
Ridiculous!

385
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:31,325
I refuse to shoot unless you fire her.

386
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,920
Sister, how about this?

387
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,078
You should rest for a few days.

388
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:37,780
You can work after your face gets better.

389
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:39,380
I will shoot the other scenes first, okay?

390
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,080
No.

391
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:48,200
Han Ruo Xi, I know you don't like me.

392
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,558
You want me to leave, don't you?

393
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,038
Sure, no problem.

394
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,439
But before I go, I want to make this clear.

395
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,219
You said my revision dragged you down, but I disagree!

396
00:25:56,219 --> 00:25:58,078
As the heroine, you don't lead by example.

397
00:25:58,079 --> 00:25:59,479
You have no professional ethics!

398
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:03,198
Are you a superstar? You don't deserve it!

399
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:06,419
How dare you?

400
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,639
What happened?

401
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,159
You're right on time.

402
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,559
I won't film with such a script.

403
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,225
Ruo Xi and the rest of you, leave.

404
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:49,960
Jian'an, this is our Chief Producer, President Kang.

405
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,159
Hello, President Kang.

406
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:53,240
Hello, please take a seat.

407
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:03,240
He is the producer.

408
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,520
What a coincidence!

409
00:27:19,975 --> 00:27:23,279
There's no problem with the emotional scenes.

410
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,038
Miss Han wants to remove Scene Forty-nine,

411
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:27,875
but she has no good reason.

412
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:32,920
However, the characters' relationship is not intense enough in the subsequent scenes.

413
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,480
Our film is shot in sequence.

414
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,079
We will take more time for the subsequent scenes.

415
00:27:36,079 --> 00:27:38,939
I hope you can revise the script soon.

416
00:27:38,939 --> 00:27:41,278
Do the best you can in the shortest time.

417
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,640
All right.

418
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,739
Okay, that's all for today.

419
00:27:45,739 --> 00:27:47,479
Miss Han is our company's superstar.

420
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:49,000
If she has done something wrong,

421
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,279
I would like to apologize on her behalf to you and Director Guo.

422
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,060
It is all right.

423
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,559
- I hope we can make this film better.
- Yes.

424
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:58,259
Thank you.

425
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:11,318
President Kang, Jian'an. My room is here. I will leave now, goodbye.

426
00:28:11,318 --> 00:28:13,700
- Goodbye, Director.
- Bye bye! Bye bye.

427
00:28:16,759 --> 00:28:18,980
President Kang, thank you for what you did today.

428
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,339
It is all right.

429
00:28:20,339 --> 00:28:24,050
I really didn't expect we would meet here again.

430
00:28:24,050 --> 00:28:26,140
Yes, it is a coincidence.

431
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,986
The Director told me you often go to the shooting site.

432
00:28:28,986 --> 00:28:31,400
I just want to learn more.

433
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,440
Kang Rui Cheng, what do you mean?

434
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,450
Do you know you have disgraced me by doing that?

435
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:43,539
Miss Han, you are a professional actress.

436
00:28:43,539 --> 00:28:46,525
I don't know what's going on between you and Su Jian'an,

437
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:49,299
but I don't want you to work with that kind of attitude.

438
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:52,275
Do you know why I target her?

439
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,680
Because she is Lu Bo Yan's wife!

440
00:29:04,479 --> 00:29:08,350
This project is important for both Rui Jin and yourself.

441
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:10,619
I hope you know what you have to do.

442
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,739
Be careful!

443
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,118
- Come on, get the microphone.
- Okay.

444
00:29:27,619 --> 00:29:29,899
For this scene, I think...

445
00:29:29,899 --> 00:29:32,558
The heroine will enter from there.

446
00:29:32,558 --> 00:29:34,625
- Okay.
- The camera will follow her.

447
00:29:34,625 --> 00:29:38,019
Then she comes in.

448
00:29:38,019 --> 00:29:40,640
Everyone, President Kang has sent you some water.

449
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,320
President Kang!

450
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,300
- President Kang, you are here!
- Director.

451
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,959
Okay, please sit, President Kang.

452
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,019
Excuse me.

453
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:52,040
Come, come.

454
00:29:52,839 --> 00:29:56,839
President Kang, I have some questions to ask you after work.

455
00:29:56,839 --> 00:29:59,759
Sorry. I'm quite busy lately.

456
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,639
Okay, cut! All right, everyone, let's stop here.

457
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:27,719
- Okay!
- Thank you, Director.

458
00:30:27,719 --> 00:30:28,670
Director.

459
00:30:28,670 --> 00:30:31,390
- President Kang, I have to leave now.
- All right. Go ahead.

460
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:34,460
- Jian'an!
- Bye bye, Director.

461
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,280
Goodbye, President Kang.

462
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
President Kang is injured!

463
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,839
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

464
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,580
How is it? You are bleeding!

465
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,180
It is all right.

466
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,660
Don't move. We need to stop the bleeding.

467
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,498
President Kang, are you all right?

468
00:31:12,498 --> 00:31:14,618
It is okay.

469
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:15,779
Is the bandage enough?

470
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:17,758
President Kang, I should take you to the hospital.

471
00:31:17,758 --> 00:31:19,239
Let's go, President Kang.

472
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,840
Let's go. Let's go.

473
00:31:40,459 --> 00:31:42,780
Stop right there!

474
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,420
Stop!

475
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:56,738
- Are you all right?
- It is okay.

476
00:31:56,738 --> 00:31:58,659
You are bleeding!

477
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,179
You should go to the hospital. I have to leave now.

478
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:03,019
It is her!

479
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,140
Finally, I have found you.

480
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:07,558
Do you know why I target her?

481
00:33:07,558 --> 00:33:10,619
Because she is Lu Bo Yan's wife!

482
00:33:23,119 --> 00:33:24,919
I have to leave for several days.

483
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,558
Please cooperate well with Director Guo.

484
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,540
Yes, I understand.

485
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:32,119
Song Yu. Please supervise the shooting progress during my absence.

486
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,578
- Keep me informed.
- All right, President Kang.

487
00:33:34,578 --> 00:33:36,440
President Kang.

488
00:33:36,979 --> 00:33:39,319
How is your injury?

489
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,420
Miss Su.

490
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:50,880
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

491
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:17,299
Jian'an.

492
00:34:24,539 --> 00:34:27,238
Bo Yan, what are you doing here?

493
00:34:27,238 --> 00:34:30,140
I am so tired of working with the crew.

494
00:34:33,025 --> 00:34:37,440
You should have told me that before.

495
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,720
You are so bad.

496
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,960
I will have to punish you.

497
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,739
Jian'an!

498
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:14,460
Jian'an, we are leaving!

499
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:28,319
President Lu. This is Miss Su's call history.

500
00:35:28,319 --> 00:35:31,919
She will go to film with the crew today.

501
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,718
Ms. Su said, you can't go to the crew.

502
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:39,400
If we arrive unexpectedly, I'm afraid...

503
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,379
Do it quickly. Otherwise, we will go on a business trip to Africa.

504
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,320
Y-Yes.

505
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,259
Wait.

506
00:35:58,259 --> 00:36:01,319
I want to know who is the executive producing the film.

507
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:02,940
Yes, Sir.

508
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,780
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

509
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,160
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

510
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:36,810
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

511
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:37,980
♫ Yes ♫

512
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:40,670
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

513
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:45,020
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

514
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,410
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

515
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:52,250
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

516
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,930
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

517
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:57,680
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

518
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,540
♫ The signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

519
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,140
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

520
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,930
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

521
00:37:06,930 --> 00:37:09,970
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

522
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:15,780
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

523
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,460
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

524
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,200
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

525
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,010
♫ Warning all problems ♫

526
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,740
♫ To stay away from us ♫

527
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,440
♫ No one can take my place ♫

528
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:34,240
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

529
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,180
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

530
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:43,240
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
