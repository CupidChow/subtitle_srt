I don't want you to hire me because of Jian'an.

65
00:04:14,219 --> 00:04:16,119
People will see it as nepotism (favoring friends).

66

00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,300
if I should have another wedding.

170
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,259
That would be great. I will arrange it now.

171
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,820
Wait.

172
00:11:34,499 --> 00:11:35,839
Make it large scale.

173
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,339
Of course.

174
00:11:51,979 --> 00:11:53,879
- Jian'an.
- Yes?

175
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,518
I am wondering if we should–

176
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:58,319
Wait a minute.

177
00:12:00,779 --> 00:12:02,379
Hello.

178
00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:07,200
Jian'an, a film company's boss wants to see you tomorrow.

179
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,525
He wants to talk about collaborating

180
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:10,379
with you on your novel's adaption.

181
00:12:10,379 --> 00:12:12,899
If it's convenient, you should come here tomorrow.

182
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,779
Then okay, I'll see you tomorrow.

183
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,619
Okay, see you then.

184
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:23,038
Bo Yan, someone wants to talk to me about the adaptation of the novel.

185
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:26,100
Then I have to congratulate you.

186
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,000
Oh, right, what were you going to say just now?

187
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,020
I was going to say...

188
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,659
I was going to say...

189
00:12:33,659 --> 00:12:37,860
we need to celebrate it.

190
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:52,739
We haven't seen such a popular female-orientated novel before.

191
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:55,300
Miss Su, you are very talented.

192
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,725
We hope to get the authorization of Miss Su and your website

193
00:12:59,725 --> 00:13:03,739
to arrange (adapt) it into a movie or a TV series.

194
00:13:03,739 --> 00:13:06,420
President Chen, that's wonderful.

195
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,250
The novel by Jian'an is so popular.

196
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,340
It would be our honor.

197
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:14,659
A movie and a TV series...

198
00:13:14,659 --> 00:13:17,340
It couldn't be better.

199
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,580
Thank you, President Chen, for supporting my novel.

200
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:25,080
However, if we want to make it into a movie or a TV series,

201
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:28,019
it would need a kind of re-creation,

202
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:31,320
but I never thought about this,

203
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,279
and I can't give you the answer right now.

204
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,800
President Chen, we need to have a plan first.

205
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:45,900
Teacher Jian'an is very deliberative.

206
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,780
I see.

207
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,739
We won't give up,

208
00:13:50,739 --> 00:13:51,740
Teacher Jian'an.

209
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:54,720
We really do like your novel.

210
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,960
We look forward to cooperating with you.

211
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,360
All right.

212
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:01,920
- All right, I have to go now.
- President Chen, I will walk you out.

213
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:16,479
Su Jian'an, what a great opportunity.

214
00:14:16,479 --> 00:14:17,939
If it can be adapted for film or TV,

215
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:19,759
your novel and Taoran Literature Network

216
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:21,640
are going to gain nationwide fame.

217
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,220
I know that.

218
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:27,039
Every novelist wants to see her work adapted into a movie or a TV series.

219
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,220
Yes.

220
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,300
Why don't you agree?

221
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,100
But the process of going from the novel to the script to

222
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,560
the completion is not as simple as you think.

223
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,978
We need to be deliberative.

224
00:14:36,978 --> 00:14:40,340
And we need a suitable production team.

225
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,518
We can't fail our readers.

226
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,619
That's fair enough.

227
00:14:54,979 --> 00:15:00,279
Jian'an, it's time to sleep.

228
00:15:00,979 --> 00:15:02,640
I need to look up data for a while.

229
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,440
You should sleep now.

230
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,200
President Lu, you need to sign this.

231
00:15:27,775 --> 00:15:29,275
President Lu,

232
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,300
please sign.

233
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:39,250
When will you tell Sister-in-law that you are going to plan another wedding?

234
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:44,920
Jian'an has been busy lately.

235
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:47,260
I couldn't find a chance to tell her.

236
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,040
How about this?

237
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,779
You should call President Du.

238
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,279
Tell him not to assign work to Jian'an.

239
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,900
Okay.

240
00:16:00,099 --> 00:16:02,940
Oh, forget it. There's no need.

241
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:06,900
I think... we should postpone the wedding.

242
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,360
- Wife, you're back.
- Yes.

243
00:16:37,499 --> 00:16:38,820
What's wrong?

244
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:41,250
Are you facing any problems?

245
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,319
Several film and television companies want to get my IP (intellectual property).

246
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:46,638
What I think is great is

247
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,159
I want to adapt my novel into a TV series,

248
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:54,770
but I feel that these companies are not reliable enough.

249
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,970
I'm very worried about whether they might handle my IP inappropriately,

250
00:16:59,974 --> 00:17:04,059
and cause me to fail my readers.

251
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:06,239
Yes, that's fair enough.

252
00:17:06,239 --> 00:17:08,119
How about this, Jian'an?

253
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:09,618
Leave it to me.

254
00:17:09,618 --> 00:17:12,319
You don't need to worry about it. Okay?

255
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:16,780
No, I want to do it myself.

256
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:19,800
If I rely on you, people will think...

257
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,850
I am useless.

258
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:24,720
Okay, it's up to you.

259
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:27,500
Go get some rest.

260
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,319
- I am going to take a bath now.
- Okay.

261
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,500
President Kang, the film's post-production is complete,

262
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:55,500
and the schedule is determined.

263
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,178
The promotion and media premiere will go as planned.

264
00:17:58,178 --> 00:17:59,879
All right, President Kang.

265
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:06,599
Miss Han, I will invite Su and President Lu for the premiere.

266
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:09,039
I hope nothing will go wrong.

267
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:13,199
Don't worry, President Kang.

268
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,750
After talking with you last time, I have been thinking a lot.

269
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,340
I have been so impulsive.

270
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:20,499
I made many mistakes.

271
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:25,079
This time, I will focus my energy on work.

272
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm glad to hear that.

273
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,480
Miss Su's novel is very popular.
[Young Master Lu's Sweet Wife]

274
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:36,319
- Do you want to adapt it into a movie?
- Yes.

275
00:18:56,859 --> 00:18:59,459
President Lu, Miss Su.

276
00:18:59,459 --> 00:19:01,959
Tomorrow, the movie will premiere at Yida Cinema.

277
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,559
I hope to see you there.

278
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:12,519
Miss Su, you can see your work on screen.

279
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,239
Bo Yan, let's go.

280
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,220
You want to go.

281
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:34,450
Okay, it's your script after all.

282
00:19:34,450 --> 00:19:36,200
- Really?
- Really.

283
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,340
Thank you.

284
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:44,279
I will see you tomorrow night.

285
00:19:55,810 --> 00:19:56,980
Thank you for coming.
[Yida Cinema]

286
00:19:56,980 --> 00:20:00,398
Would all producers please go to the studio for the interview?
[Yida Cinema]

287
00:20:00,398 --> 00:20:01,419
Congratulations, President Kang.

288
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:03,970
All film critics and guests who came to watch the movie gave it

289
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:07,890
high ratings and spoke glowingly of the movie's plot and content.

290
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:10,560
Well, anything like this couldn't be possible without

291
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,070
our excellent acting and production team. They get the credit.

292
00:20:14,075 --> 00:20:18,020
Miss Han, you impressed us with your wonderful performance.

293
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:22,080
Can you say something about the role?

294
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,240
For the success of the role, our screenwriter,

295
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:28,570
Miss Su, should take some credit.

296
00:20:28,574 --> 00:20:31,218
Miss Su is very talented.

297
00:20:31,218 --> 00:20:33,199
After she joined our crew,

298
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,224
she did a lot of work on the roles and the storyline.

299
00:20:37,224 --> 00:20:41,199
And my role is very complex and real.

300
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:45,898
President Kang, you found such an excellent screenwriter like Miss Su.

301
00:20:45,898 --> 00:20:49,318
It's been our honor to meet Miss Su.

302
00:20:49,319 --> 00:20:51,658
This is my first time as a screenwriter.

303
00:20:51,658 --> 00:20:55,118
I want to thank President Kang and Miss Han for their trust and help.

304
00:20:55,118 --> 00:20:58,200
President Kang, Miss Su's novels are very popular now.

305
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,639
Will you continue to work together in the future?

306
00:21:01,639 --> 00:21:05,879
It would be my honor to adapt Miss Su's novel.

307
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:09,140
How great. I am a big fan of Miss Su.

308
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,200
I'm looking forward to it now.

309
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,320
President Lu, Miss Su has a new achievement.

310
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,100
I believe your help was essential.

311
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:22,098
As the husband of Jian'an, I fully support her career.

312
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:25,919
Jian'an and her happiness are more important than anything else.

313
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:43,049
Su Jian'an attends the movie's premiere,

314
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:45,278
accompanied by her husband, Lu Bo Yan.

315
00:21:45,278 --> 00:21:48,340
They are displaying affection.

316
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,299
The new novel by Su Jian'an has become a popular IP

317
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:54,881
under the endorsement of Lu Bo Yan and Lu's Media.

318
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:57,975
Many investment and production companies

319
00:21:57,975 --> 00:22:01,075
have extended offers to her.

320
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,499
My goodness!

321
00:22:17,499 --> 00:22:20,880
I've gained 50,000 followers!

322
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,998
Luo Xiao Xi, what are you doing?

323
00:22:27,998 --> 00:22:30,800
Sister Jiao, my movie is an overnight hit.

324
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,899
See, I've gained tens of thousands of followers.

325
00:22:32,899 --> 00:22:34,358
I am going to be a celebrity, right?

326
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:36,758
Are you this happy because of tens of thousands of followers?

327
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:38,038
Look at Han Ruo Xi.

328
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:39,639
She has so many fans.

329
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:40,959
Enough, stop it.

330
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,860
- Go on. Keep practicing.
- Okay.

331
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,758
The heroine should be slimmer.

332
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:10,618
I think a fat girl is an eyesore,

333
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:13,598
and a freshwoman (college student) is the best.

334
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:16,060
The names, Uncle and "Lolita," would be better.

335
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,219
- And—
- President Yin,

336
00:23:17,219 --> 00:23:19,820
I really can't accept your idea.

337
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,720
It's all right.

338
00:23:20,721 --> 00:23:24,650
It's just my personal opinion for your reference.

339
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:29,280
I am wondering why you want to adapt my novel.

340
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,579
Because, Miss Su, you are Mrs. Lu.

341
00:23:32,579 --> 00:23:36,378
No matter how your novel is adapted, you will have Mr. Lu's support.

342
00:23:36,378 --> 00:23:38,719
It would be my honor to work with President Lu.

343
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:42,350
My brothers also want to invest.

344
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:46,660
You found yourself a good husband.

345
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,719
I'm sorry. I have to go now.

346
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,080
Thank you.

347
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,719
- Mr. Jiang.
- Well...

348
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,879
Go away and get lost!

349
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,099
President Lu, I investigated the film companies

350
00:24:29,099 --> 00:24:30,819
that hope to cooperate with Sister-in-law.

351
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,218
How is it?

352
00:24:32,218 --> 00:24:34,850
None are reliable so far.

353
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,119
I understand.

354
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,640
I'm back.

355
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:51,400
Jian'an, stop trying to find a film and TV company.

356
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,859
I will invest in it, and I will build a team.

357
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:56,399
You will have the final say. Okay?

358
00:24:57,239 --> 00:25:00,699
Bo Yan, I can do it myself.

359
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:05,100
I just don't want to see you run around, and end up failing.

360
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,379
I would feel so bad, you know?

361
00:25:07,379 --> 00:25:09,020
I know you are considerate,

362
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:11,259
but you also promised me that you would respect me.

363
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:15,919
I want to rely on myself, not on your help.

364
00:25:17,079 --> 00:25:19,739
Okay, I want to go upstairs now.

365
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:41,020
Another film and TV company sent an offer.

366
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,139
They have been waiting all morning. Do you want to see them?

367
00:25:43,139 --> 00:25:44,138
Sure.

368
00:25:44,138 --> 00:25:46,719
Jian'an, you've been so tired lately.

369
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:48,819
We should let them come tomorrow.

370
00:25:48,819 --> 00:25:50,620
I am fine.

371
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,379
President Kang, Song Yu.

372
00:25:55,379 --> 00:25:57,119
Is it you?

373
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:59,819
We are here to talk to you about the adaptation.

374
00:25:59,819 --> 00:26:01,318
Just contact me directly.

375
00:26:01,318 --> 00:26:03,619
- Why did you wait here all morning?
- It's business.

376
00:26:03,619 --> 00:26:06,579
If I contact you privately, I will cause you some trouble.

377
00:26:06,579 --> 00:26:07,440
It's all right.

378
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,079
Miss Su, can we start now?

379
00:26:10,079 --> 00:26:11,639
Sit down.

380
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:19,500
"Young Master Lu's Sweet Wife," number one in female-orientated novels on Taoran Literature Network.

381
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,698
The total clicks are over 120 million.

382
00:26:21,698 --> 00:26:23,499
Based on the genre of the novel,

383
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:27,624
the audience will mainly consist of females aged between 18 and 30.

384
00:26:27,624 --> 00:26:32,394
Therefore, our team will choose experienced producers of metropolitan romance.

385
00:26:32,394 --> 00:26:36,419
Also, out of respect for the original novel and to ensure authenticity,

386
00:26:36,419 --> 00:26:40,739
you will be the chief producer and screenwriter.

387
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:43,099
We will be responsible for building the team,

388
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:44,679
filming, and post-production.

389
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:47,220
We will work in close collaboration.

390
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,879
Miss Su, that's all.

391
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:52,518
President Kang, your plan is completely beyond my expectation.

392
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,149
Miss Su, President Kang has studied the novel with us.

393
00:26:56,149 --> 00:26:58,974
He will try to reflect the sincere, delicate emotions as accurately as he can.

394
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:01,960
It's the key to film and television success.

395
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,519
No problem.

396
00:27:03,519 --> 00:27:06,000
What about investment?

397
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,909
You will have 30% of the share, along with the copyright.

398
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:13,899
Ruijin Group will take 70% with the investment.

399
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,038
Of course, it's negotiable.

400
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,500
It's no problem.

401
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:20,839
Let's make the deal.

402
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:24,958
Okay. We will sign the contract as soon as possible.

403
00:27:24,958 --> 00:27:28,280
- Happy cooperation.
- Happy cooperation.

404
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:35,300
Why are you here?

405
00:27:36,619 --> 00:27:39,979
Jian'an, I was impulsive before.

406
00:27:39,979 --> 00:27:41,539
I didn't respect your ideas.

407
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,879
I can promise you that I won't interfere in your film production.

408
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,738
But you need to promise me. If you have any difficulty—

409
00:27:47,738 --> 00:27:50,200
You will be the first one to know.

410
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,280
Thank you.

411
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,079
Look at you. You have been looking so pale lately.

412
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,038
I am very busy,

413
00:27:58,039 --> 00:28:01,679
but I am striving to reach my goal.

414
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,580
I am happy.

415
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,620
Okay.

416
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,499
As long as you are happy...

417
00:28:09,499 --> 00:28:13,240
Oh, by the way. I have good news to tell you.

418
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,659
I have found my partner.

419
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:16,981
Really? Which company is it?

420
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:18,439
President Kang's company.

421
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,178
His movie was a success.

422
00:28:20,178 --> 00:28:22,739
It proves his company's ability.

423
00:28:22,739 --> 00:28:24,698
And he knows my work well.

424
00:28:24,698 --> 00:28:26,138
He made a very detailed proposal.

425
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,719
He also respects my thoughts and opinions.

426
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,979
I disagree.

427
00:28:28,979 --> 00:28:30,439
Why don't you deliberate with me before deciding?

428
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,440
You just said you wouldn't interfere, right?

429
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,560
Did you forget about our earlier conflicts?

430
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:36,379
Why you are so ungenerous?

431
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:38,260
He and I are just business partners!

432
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,698
It's not as complicated as you think.

433
00:28:39,698 --> 00:28:41,658
Why can't you believe in me?

434
00:28:41,658 --> 00:28:43,898
Now you are going to see each other every day.

435
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:45,618
I can tell you, for this, there can be no compromise.

436
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:47,219
I'm against it.

437
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:50,038
President Lu, Sister-in-law, don't be angry.

438
00:28:50,038 --> 00:28:51,739
Shut up!

439
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:10,940
Brother Shen, is there anything wrong with the agreement?

440
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:15,385
President Kang intensely prepared for this and took his time

441
00:29:15,385 --> 00:29:18,199
so we would have Miss Su's approval.

442
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:20,779
Our two companies are competitors.

443
00:29:20,779 --> 00:29:23,440
President Lu doesn't want Mrs. Lu to get involved.

444
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,399
You have read the agreement.

445
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:27,200
It is a legal document.

446
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,099
As for other things, I don't have the final say.

447
00:29:30,099 --> 00:29:33,679
President Lu can talk to President Kang directly if necessary.

448
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,860
That would be better.

449
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,100
Okay.

450
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,920
I will see you tomorrow night.

451
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,960
President Kang's company.

452
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,979
Mrs. Lu, I made seafood porridge.

453
00:30:02,979 --> 00:30:04,139
You should try it.

454
00:30:04,139 --> 00:30:06,359
No, thanks, Uncle Xu. I have a meeting.

455
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:08,378
You are going to see Kang Rui Cheng, right?

456
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:09,898
It's work.

457
00:30:09,898 --> 00:30:13,199
Let me tell you, he has other intentions.

458
00:30:13,199 --> 00:30:14,698
You'd better stay away from him.

459
00:30:14,698 --> 00:30:16,580
I know him well.

460
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:19,100
Why are you so mean to him?

461
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:22,658
What did he do to you?

462
00:30:22,658 --> 00:30:24,598
Lu Bo Yan, are you crazy?

463
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:28,441
I don't care. Stay at home; you can't go anywhere.

464
00:30:28,441 --> 00:30:30,698
Can't I go to work now?

465
00:30:30,698 --> 00:30:33,200
I can tell you, no way!

466
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:38,225
President Lu.
