[Episode 2]

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:27,579
Living alone in such a big house, what a waste!

14
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,499
Hello, Mrs. Lu. I'm your butler.

15
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:34,419
You can call me Uncle Xu. Welcome.

16
00:01:34,419 --> 00:01:37,020
Uncle Xu, just call me Jian'an.

17
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,125
That's not appropriate. Now that you have the marriage certificate,

18
00:01:41,125 --> 00:01:44,580
you are President Lu's legal wife.

19
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:47,699
Your mother-in-law told me to take care of you.

20
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:50,959
- Thank you, Uncle Xu.
- Miss Su, your suitcase is here.

21
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,260
Where's President Lu?

22
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:54,441
He should be in a meeting. I can ask for you—

23
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:57,000
No, the meeting is more important.

24
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,619
You two really don't have to take care of me.

25
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,359
Then let me show you to your room.

26
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,460
Please,

27
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:12,160
Mrs. Lu, let me introduce you to the environment here.

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,059
This is the dining room. There is the kitchen.

29
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,939
And here is the living room.

30
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:25,760
Do you live in such a big house with just the two of you?

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,300
What if there's a burglar?

32
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,900
Mrs. Lu, you can rest assured.

33
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,180
We have an intelligent anti-theft system.

34
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:37,350
Press the button, and the whole villa will be surrounded.

35
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:41,659
There will be a blackout and no network. No one can escape!

36
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,940
So awesome!

37
00:02:48,619 --> 00:02:50,760
- Hello?
- Is this Su Jian'an?

38
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:54,080
- May I ask who this is?
- I'm President Du.

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,940
I told you to come to my company, but you didn't show up. Why is that?

40
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:00,099
- I actually—
- It's okay. It's okay.

41
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:03,399
Let me tell you that your novel should resume the update.

42
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:06,460
- Really?
- I give you one day.

43
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:08,740
By three o'clock tomorrow afternoon,

44
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,480
you need to submit it.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,578
All right, I will. Don't worry.

46
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:21,700
President, Lu's Media won't invest unless we cut off the boys' novels, right?

47
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,760
Look, they just want to bargain.

48
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,959
Why does it have anything to do with "Lin Nan's Murder"?

49
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:31,220
Sit down.

50
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:34,650
I guess you don't know

51
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,690
that President Lu is reading this novel.

52
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:42,219
I think he is too busy to read this kind of novel,

53
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:46,280
and I don't think it's a good novel!

54
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:50,320
Presidents have different tastes than the public, all right?

55
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,480
President Lu made an understatement that day,

56
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,339
but I dare say, he loves that novel very much!

57
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:59,770
So the timely update of this novel

58
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:03,679
is the key to move his heart.

59
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:06,020
We need to flatter him.

60
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:07,959
Follow the trend.

61
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:11,059
President, you are so smart!

62
00:04:11,059 --> 00:04:12,959
I am handsome!

63
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:30,239
Mrs. Lu, in order to create a better creative environment for you,

64
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:33,199
President Lu has vacated his master bedroom for you.

65
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,879
He also made a little special arrangement.

66
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:38,360
This is your study.

67
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,679
Such a girly room!

68
00:04:40,679 --> 00:04:43,720
How could I create a murder story here?

69
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:47,159
Your bedroom is here. Please, follow me.

70
00:04:52,999 --> 00:04:56,620
So big! Uncle Xu, could you change this room for me?

71
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,140
A smaller one is okay. It's fine even without a bed!

72
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,960
It's very complicated.

73
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,119
I just obey President Lu's arrangements.

74
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:04,559
You need to have some rest first.

75
00:05:04,559 --> 00:05:07,300
Just call me if you need any help.

76
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:09,740
Thank you, Uncle Xu.

77
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:28,838
A year is neither too long nor too short.

78
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:31,100
It's enough for me to get everything sorted.

79
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,679
Till then, Dad has no reason to force me.

80
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,518
Maybe I can achieve my goal ahead of schedule.

81
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:39,319
Then I can get rid of Lu Bo Yan earlier.

00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:00,700
Stupid blessings from Dad!

85
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,179
Currently the mainstream literature market

86
00:06:02,179 --> 00:06:05,179
has been occupied by Zongheng Network and Taoran Literature Network.

87
00:06:05,179 --> 00:06:08,299
Zongheng Network has a large group of male readers,

88
00:06:08,299 --> 00:06:10,700
and Taoran Literature Network, the one we will acquire this time,

89
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,140
is mainly based on female-orientated novels.

90
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:15,438
The main sources of income for literature websites in the past

91
00:06:15,439 --> 00:06:17,379
were derivative (imitative) developments.

92
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:21,260
And now that the game market and the film industry are declining,
[Lin Nan's Murder]

IP (Intellectual Property) value is collapsing.
[Not updated this week]

94
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,619
Taoran Literature Network wants to find a way out

95
00:06:25,619 --> 00:06:27,539
so they need to abandon male-orientated novels,

96
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,820
and put energy and funds into female-orientated novels.

97
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,059
That is my summary.

98
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:36,559
President Lu.

99
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,220
Go ahead.

100
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:46,140
That's all for our investment project analysis today.

101
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,450
Now President Lu and the partners need to vote.

102
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,619
Film and television dramas mainly focus on female audiences.

103
00:06:57,619 --> 00:06:59,539
I agree with this suggestion.

104
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:02,380
What do you think of abandoning male-orientated novels?

105
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,675
Yes, fair enough. It's better to improve the strengths

106
00:07:04,675 --> 00:07:07,700
than to make up for the shortcomings.

107
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,600
I also agree.

108
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:12,180
All right.

109
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,790
Abandon male-orientated novels.

110
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:19,290
Yes.

111
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:00,050
Let's start.

Let's get started.

Dim light perturbs Lin Nan,

114
00:08:19,859 --> 00:08:22,220
but in order to catch the real murderer,

115
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,939
she has to muster courage.

116
00:08:23,939 --> 00:08:26,379
Setting the pink rose at her breast straight,

117
00:08:26,379 --> 00:08:30,639
she sits down at the front of the bar, next to the strange man.

118
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:34,580
Lin Nan squints, evaluating the strange man.

119
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,659
Bartender, give a glass of "Pink Lady"

120

Where are my things?

124
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,839
The strange man smiles and pulls a pistol from his pocket.

125
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,820
Aiming at Lin Nan, he says,

126
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,820
"Miss Lin, my boss wants to tell you something."

127
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:09,080
"You... will be a scapegoat for the rest of your life."

128
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,840
A drop of cold sweat slips down her forehead

129
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,700
as Lin Nan repeatedly recalls the past.

130
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,979
Who betrayed her, Katie or Pai Da Xing?

131
00:09:14,979 --> 00:09:17,279
Farewell.

132

You didn't see this coming, did you?

I saw through your identity a long time ago.

How did you find out?

135
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,100
You underestimated the power of the Moon Prism!

136
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,360
Lin Nan shouts, "Transform!"

137
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,879
What the h*ll?

138
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,379
How do I create in this silly place?

139
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:49,080
How do I arrange the bar scene?

140
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:52,340
I need to highlight the advantages of being a female agent.

141

Collect intelligence (top secret information) through feminine charm.

142
00:09:56,619 --> 00:09:59,140
Feminine charm!

What can I do?

146
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,859
I know!

147
00:10:26,859 --> 00:10:27,899
Hello, Xiao Xi.

148

I haven't seen him all day. But it's great!

150

We live under the same roof, but we live apart!

151

Sister, come on!

152
00:10:39,859 --> 00:10:43,558
There's such a beautiful man in front of you, and yet is your heart not moved?

He's the National Husband!

Please make it a sure thing!

I am not an idler. I need to write novels!

156
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:56,878
My great writer loves creating, rather than a beautiful man.

157
00:10:56,878 --> 00:10:59,180
Stop, it's not funny!

158
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,740
Xiao Xi, teach me how to display the charm of a woman.

159

I have a scene of a female agent seducing someone in a bar.

You dress like that because you're going to a bar. What else would it be for?

As you can see, Taoran Literature Network has 321 male-orientated writers contracted.

175
00:11:56,738 --> 00:11:58,619
If we terminate the contract now,
[Su Jian'an]

00:11:58,619 --> 00:12:02,599
we need to compensate a large sum of liquidated damages.

177
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,379
I wonder if it's possible to transfer potential male-orientated writers to female-orientated teams.

178
00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:15,359
It's all right, theoretically. But the problem is

179
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:18,340
that male readers have different satisfactory elements than female ones.

180
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,900
And male-orientated writers

181
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:24,560
can't change their mindsets that easily.

He'll get the spare key from Mom's house.

321

Then he should be back soon, right?

Stop it.

323
00:24:15,418 --> 00:24:17,299

You said that this Jian'an–

330
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,639
I had hoped she could remain to be a male-orientated writer.

331
00:24:50,639 --> 00:24:51,938
It's great now!

332
00:24:51,938 --> 00:24:54,859
The valuation is one hundred million less!

333
00:24:54,859 --> 00:24:57,340
By the way, did we terminate the contract with Su Jian'an?

334
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,199
She insists on finishing the last chapter.

335
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:04,218
It's a waste of time!

336
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:09,525
Without President Lu, no one cares about her novel!

337

Lin Nan pants saying, "It's so hot!"

338
00:25:12,424 --> 00:25:17,599
Then she falls into Chen Mo's arms.

339
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,919
Why pant?

340
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,740
What should I write next?

00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,239
It's three o'clock in the afternoon now.

342
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:33,880
Why has Uncle Xu still not returned?

343
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:39,259
D*mn it, I can't finish it today.

When will President Lu arrive?

346
00:25:44,019 --> 00:25:46,658
Actually, he should be here by now.

347
00:25:46,658 --> 00:25:48,639
Maybe he's stuck in a traffic jam.

348
00:25:48,639 --> 00:25:50,359
Should you call him?

349
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:54,220
O-O-Okay, I'll make a phone call. I'll call. I'll call.

350
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,140
Why do you have a signal?

351
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,698
Ma'am, I set the system's ID.

352
00:26:05,698 --> 00:26:06,939

00:34:14,459 --> 00:34:17,400
Lin Nan and Chen Mo get married and lead a happy life!

492
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,170
And they live happily ever after.

493
00:34:19,179 --> 00:34:20,819
Correct!

494
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:25,200
[End of this chapter]

495
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:28,819
Finally!

496
00:34:30,299 --> 00:34:31,638
No...

497
00:34:31,638 --> 00:34:35,275
After talking with you, I added so much sweetness.

498
00:34:35,275 --> 00:34:40,120
Let me tell you... Without emotional volatility, novels can't go viral nowadays.

499
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,070
["Lin Nan's Murder": Chapter 95 has been successfully published.]

500
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:54,579
President, I have uploaded my new chapter.

501
00:34:54,579 --> 00:34:57,480
Sorry for the delay.

502
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,658
President Lu, the car has arrived.

503
00:34:59,658 --> 00:35:02,459
Zhang is waiting for you downstairs.

504
00:35:04,659 --> 00:35:05,940
Don't you need some rest?

505
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,879
Do you think everyone is as idle as you?

506
00:35:08,879 --> 00:35:10,880
You...

507
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,259
Forget it.

508
00:35:23,219 --> 00:35:26,898
President Lu. Didn't you sleep well last night?

509
00:35:26,898 --> 00:35:30,260
It's all right. I just wrote a novel last night... I am a bit tired.

510
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,399
Did you write a novel?

511
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,379
Oh, right! President Du waited for you all afternoon yesterday.

512
00:35:33,379 --> 00:35:35,939
He was so anxious that he called me last night.

513
00:35:35,939 --> 00:35:38,479
We can renegotiate our company's shares.

514
00:35:38,479 --> 00:35:39,999
President Lu, you are so awesome!

515
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:41,838
Well, we should take advantage of this.

516
00:35:41,838 --> 00:35:43,449
All right, President Lu.

517
00:35:43,449 --> 00:35:45,539
I have arranged the party tonight for you.

518
00:35:45,539 --> 00:35:48,220
Miss Han will attend with you.

519
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,800
President Lu.

520
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,400
Got it.

521
00:35:58,819 --> 00:36:02,019
Why hasn't President Du replied to me yet?

522
00:36:14,419 --> 00:36:18,639
President, I have updated my new novel.

523
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,300
What? Terminate the contract?

524
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,649
Listen to me. I was a bit late because of a special reason.

525
00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:28,140
Hello?

526
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:43,620
- Hello?
- Hello, Jian'an, the president has gone to attend the party.

527
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,599
Where is he now? I need to see him.

528
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,718
At the Xiyue Hotel. Should I go with you?

529
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:50,580
No need, I can talk to him.

530
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:54,360
Driver, go to the Xiyue Hotel.

531
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:04,138
Bo Yan, it took you long enough. Let's go inside.

532
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:24,100
President Lu.

533
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,239
Long time no see.

534
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,879
Long time no see, President Pang.

535
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,738
You are a perfect match, so great!

536
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:38,278
Your achievements in the catering industry have been so remarkable in recent years.

537
00:37:38,278 --> 00:37:39,999
Thank you.

538
00:37:44,819 --> 00:37:46,400
I'm sorry.

539
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:52,099
Your Lu's Media is really at the highest level of activity.

540
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:56,138
President Du, I'm sorry to disturb you.

541
00:37:56,138 --> 00:37:58,078
I have uploaded my new chapter.

542
00:37:58,078 --> 00:38:01,338
I am sorry for the delay. Could you give me another chance?

543
00:38:01,338 --> 00:38:02,818
I'm not free now.

544
00:38:02,818 --> 00:38:05,059
I modified it according to your requirements.

545
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:06,719
You should take a look first.

546
00:38:06,719 --> 00:38:09,718
Take a look? Su Jian'an,

547
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:13,218
look at the comments yourself! They all say it's horrible!

548
00:38:13,218 --> 00:38:16,799
Are you still saying those are my requirements?

549
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:19,579
What are you doing? What?

550
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:22,160
It's nonsense.

551
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,598
This is all your fault.

552
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,200
Now you should understand that you are not fit for this industry.

553
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:35,299
I'll tell Chen Xuan Xuan to talk about the contract termination with you.

554
00:38:35,299 --> 00:38:38,639
You should go now. I am busy.

555
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:40,100
- President!
- Stop making trouble here!

556
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:42,599
President, I...
