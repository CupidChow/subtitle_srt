12
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,900
[Episode 21]

13
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,880
President Lu, I read the agreement. There are no loopholes.

14
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,560
I don't think we can stop them.

15
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:23,859
Kang Rui Cheng must have been fully prepared.

16
00:01:24,499 --> 00:01:26,980
It is indeed a little inappropriate for Sister-in-Law to do this,

17
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:31,700
but it does seem like no one can adapt the novel to a film better than Kang Rui Cheng's company.

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:34,440
Why don't we invest in this project, too?

19
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:37,400
Then you can work with Sister-in-law as well.

20
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,939
You mean...

21
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:41,299
- I should invest in him?
- Correct!

22
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,040
That's feasible.

23
00:01:46,525 --> 00:01:48,565
Help me make an appointment with Kang Rui Cheng.

24
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,520
I want you to withdraw.

25
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,580
Name your price.

26
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,900
You must be joking.

27
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,139
Ms. Su and I have already signed an agreement of intent.

28
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:07,500
I am a man of my word.

29
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,460
I completed this novel with Jian'an

30
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,020
so I don't think anyone understands this novel

31
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,770
better than I do.

32
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:18,139
I am confident that I can make the adaption a success.

33
00:02:18,139 --> 00:02:19,300
I'm not so sure about that.

34
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,740
President Lu, please just get straight to the point.

35
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:31,500
Lu Group and I will participate in the adaptation.

36
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:36,010
We will be co-producers.

37
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,819
As long as Miss Su agrees,

38
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:43,860
I have no objections.

39
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:05,300
You are here.

40
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,499
Just get straight to the point.

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,740
Do you remember what day it is today?

42
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,940
[Honey, Happy Birthday]

43
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,400
See, you've even forgotten what day it is today.

44
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,099
Come on!

45
00:03:42,099 --> 00:03:45,199
Blow out the candle and make a wish first.

46
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,379
Thank you.

47
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,379
Can I go now?

48
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:18,960
This was my favorite toy in junior high!

49
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,520
It was so hard to get back then!

50
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,519
There's more.

51
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,859
Do you remember how I broke your favorite pen in junior high?

52
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:35,219
Actually, I wanted to give you a new one.

53
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,600
Why are there so many?

54
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,100
Jian'an, it has been a decade since we separated,

55
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,400
hasn't it?

56
00:04:54,925 --> 00:04:59,110
So during those ten years,

57
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,570
did you prepare a gift for me every year?

58
00:05:05,119 --> 00:05:07,578
After I left Taoran,

59
00:05:07,578 --> 00:05:11,179
I never thought I would see you again one day.

60
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:13,739
However, I didn't want to miss your birthday.

61
00:05:13,739 --> 00:05:16,450
So I prepared a gift

62
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,770
for your birthday every year.

63
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:24,319
Actually, I was very scared that

64
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:26,099
you hadn't forgiven me yet.

65
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:28,300
I was afraid you would reject me.

66
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,375
So I kept them all this time.

67
00:05:37,675 --> 00:05:39,630
To be honest,

68
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,460
I really truly didn't expect

69
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:47,220
I could see you again,

70
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:51,230
marry you and be with you,

71
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,780
let alone give you these gifts all at once.

72
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,350
As a man, I am indeed too petty.

73
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,340
I'm sorry.

74
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,459
Can you forgive me?

75
00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:22,819
I actually didn't mean it, either.

76
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,690
Also, I talked to Kang Rui Cheng.

77
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:30,200
I will be investing in your project.

78
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,540
I saw this coming.

79
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:42,060
Listen to me first.

80
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,458
It's just an investment.

81
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:48,525
I promise I won't interfere with your decisions.

82
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,279
Also, as your consultant,

83
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:57,150
I think no one knows

84
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,800
our story better than I do.

85
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,539
I will personally give them guidance on set.

86
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:09,060
It will definitely be a huge help to the movie.

87
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,800
Let's eat cake!

88
00:07:28,559 --> 00:07:30,819
I bought your favorite cake.

89
00:07:31,659 --> 00:07:33,700
I don't want to eat sweets! I will get fat!

90
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,440
No, it's your birthday today.

91
00:07:38,379 --> 00:07:39,979
No!

92
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:44,080
Baby, just have one bite.

93
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,760
- All right?
- No!

94
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,460
Please.

95
00:07:48,339 --> 00:07:49,839
One bite.

111
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,279
President Lu, I'll start now.

112
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,775
Today, the "Young Master Lu's Sweet Wife" project

113
00:09:08,775 --> 00:09:10,699
officially starts!

114
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:18,479
President Lu and President Kang are our co-producers.

115
00:09:18,479 --> 00:09:22,159
Su Jian'an is the chief screenwriter and script supervisor.

116
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:26,500
The screenwriting team will include... Xiao Yong and Old Yan!

117
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,879
Xuan Xuan, you will be the screenwriter's assistant.

118
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:34,279
As for commercial affairs and publicity...

119
00:09:37,359 --> 00:09:38,610
- Goodness...
- Yes.

120
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,050
Do I have to call your name every time?

121
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,840
Be more alert next time!

122
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,610
Okay. So...

123
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:50,100
Well, then let's begin now.

124
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,700
Start.

125
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:56,859
We made a list of a few problems

126
00:09:56,859 --> 00:09:58,975
that need to be discussed with all of you.

127
00:09:58,975 --> 00:10:00,680
Based on the genre of the film,

128
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,820
we chose some directors who film similar genres.

129
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,300
Among them, Director Guo Ze is the best at this genre.

130
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:09,040
In addition, we have cooperated before with the movie, "When Time Stops."

131
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,239
It was a blockbuster with good box office results.

132
00:10:11,239 --> 00:10:13,859
Director Guo is also very interested in joining us.

133
00:10:13,859 --> 00:10:17,425
I also hope Director Guo can join us.

134
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:22,860
- What do you think?
- It would be the icing on the cake!

135
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,600
So we've decided on Director Guo.

136
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:43,819
To ensure the authenticity of the novel,

137
00:10:43,819 --> 00:10:46,420
we might need to make some adjustments.

138
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,619
With Jian'an here,

139
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:51,400
I don't think any adjustments are necessary.

140
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,339
It's like this: first, there is a problem with the name.

141
00:10:54,339 --> 00:10:55,759
"Young Master Lu's Sweet Wife"

142
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:58,440
is not a suitable name for a film.

143
00:10:59,319 --> 00:11:01,060
I chose that name.

144
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,560
This is an adaptation of the novel.

145
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,000
Our main audience is obviously the book's fans.

146
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,300
That's how we'll attract the fans and viewers the most.

147
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:11,125
Therefore, we can't change the name.

148
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:14,420
President Lu, our film is intended for the mainstream market.

149
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,579
This title sounds too much like a novel.

150
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:19,259
Those who haven't read the novel won't resonate with it.

151
00:11:19,259 --> 00:11:21,640
It's you who can't resonate with it.

152
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:32,239
We all just want what's best for the project.

153
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:36,560
Bo Yan, I think President Kang is right.

154
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,980
Miss Su, what thoughts do you have?

155
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,410
The contract marriage between the male and female lead

156
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:45,625
is what starts off this story.

157
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:49,660
How about we call it "Love in Time"?

158
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,260
I don't agree!

159
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:54,020
Right. Yes, Jian'an.

160
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,440
I think the original name is great.

161
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,259
I think President Lu is right.

162
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:02,060
I think "Love in Time" sounds more like a movie.

163
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:04,099
I'm just being honest!

164
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:05,600
I think both names are great.

165
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,640
We all just want what's best for the project.

166
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,180
All right!

167
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,859
Let's drop this topic for now.

168
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,700
I'll ask my readers' opinions first.

169
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,800
All right. Let's move on.

170
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:23,540
The heroine is a forensic scientist, which may trigger political risks.

171
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,339
- We advise changing her profession.
- There's no need for that.

172
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:29,099
Because of time constraints for the film, we need to streamline the plot.

173
00:12:29,099 --> 00:12:30,400
We can make more films.

174
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,250
There are too many characters. We think the insignificant characters should be deleted

175
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,579
and merged with the main characters!

176
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:36,379
No, they can't be deleted.

177
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,199
This is all for the film.

178
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:09,459
I have good news.

179
00:13:09,459 --> 00:13:13,499
You'll be able to see "Young Master Lu" on the big screen.

180
00:13:13,499 --> 00:13:15,580
- Congratulations!
- Really? Wow!

181
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:18,299
So great! I can finally see a real-life Young Master Lu!

182
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,400
The male lead must be handsome!

183
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,059
I only have that one request: a handsome guy!

184
00:13:21,059 --> 00:13:22,619
Let me ask you something.

185
00:13:22,619 --> 00:13:24,600
We need to change the name for the film.

186
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,940
Other than the fans of the original work, we also have to attract other viewers.

187
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,239
So we've changed it to "Love in Time."

188
00:13:31,239 --> 00:13:33,560
- Can you guys accept that?
- No! Absolutely not.

189
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,200
The title "Young Master Lu" is very meaningful.

190
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,081
- If you change it, will it still be the original novel?
- I can accept it!

191
00:13:37,081 --> 00:13:38,680
The new name is good.

192
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,320
It has a nice ring to it!

193
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,999
Ultra Alien, why can't you accept it?

194
00:13:41,999 --> 00:13:45,159
Since you all accept it, I have no objections.

195
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:48,100
Does only one person disagree?

196
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,500
All right, you may leave now.

197
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,475
S-Sir, can I show you another talent of mine?

198
00:14:05,475 --> 00:14:07,519
There's another movie next door. Go and audition for them.

199
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,540
Thank you, Sir.

200
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,140
He is far worse than Feng Feng.

201
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:15,499
Yes, I also think Feng Feng is better.

202
00:14:15,499 --> 00:14:17,200
We cooperated with him last time, too.

203
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,479
I also think Feng Feng is quite suitable.

204
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:22,025
Since we have pretty much decided on the male characters,

205
00:14:22,025 --> 00:14:26,625
let's start selecting the female lead and the other female characters.

206
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,419
President Lu, Feng Feng has been chosen as the male lead.

207
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,900
Sister Jiao!

208
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,800
Xiao Xi, you've been making great progress these days.

209
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,219
Thank you, Sister Jiao!

210
00:14:58,219 --> 00:14:59,700
- Xiao Xi.
- Yes?

211
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:04,359
Mrs. Lu, Su Jian'an is your good friend, isn't she?

212
00:15:04,359 --> 00:15:05,499
Yes!

213
00:15:05,499 --> 00:15:08,259
Her novel will be adapted into a film.

214
00:15:08,259 --> 00:15:09,419
Did you know this?

215
00:15:09,419 --> 00:15:10,520
I do know!

216
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:13,159
Su Jian'an is your good friend

217
00:15:13,159 --> 00:15:16,775
and our company is a co-producer for this film.

218
00:15:16,775 --> 00:15:20,800
With your qualities, you could totally be the leading actress!

219
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,879
Leading actress?

220
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,140
But I don't think I suit the female lead role though.

221
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,840
Xiao Xi, come here.

222
00:15:30,975 --> 00:15:32,320
Do you know what?

223
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,925
Right now, so many people desperately want to have the lead role.

224
00:15:35,925 --> 00:15:39,540
As for us, our company is investing in this film

225
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,879
and the screenwriter is your best friend!

226
00:15:41,879 --> 00:15:43,519
Just talk to Su Jian'an

227
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,219
and the leading role is yours!

228
00:15:46,219 --> 00:15:48,199
Besides, look at yourself.

229
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:50,039
Why would you not be suitable for the role?

230
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:53,140
You are just as good as the others out there!

231
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,740
Listen to me. When they are selecting the female lead role,

232
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,680
go for the audition.

233
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,990
President Kang.

234
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,260
Come in.

235
00:16:17,139 --> 00:16:18,775
Is there something you want to talk to me about?

236
00:16:18,775 --> 00:16:22,680
I hear that you are selecting actors for the Su Jian'an film.

237
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:25,680
The leading actor has been confirmed. We are still looking for actresses.

238
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,260
President Kang, have you forgotten me?

239
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,518
I have indeed made many mistakes,

240
00:16:31,518 --> 00:16:34,219
but work and personal life should be looked at separately.

241
00:16:34,219 --> 00:16:36,979
I have never lost to anyone in acting.

242
00:16:36,979 --> 00:16:39,878
I know the leading actor is Feng Feng,

243
00:16:39,878 --> 00:16:41,319
and the director is Director Guo.

244
00:16:41,319 --> 00:16:43,839
Luo Xiao Xi will probably also be participating.

245
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,125
If I join them, the "When Time Stops" team will be reuniting.

246
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:51,559
That would be great, wouldn't it?

247
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:54,140
You don't suit the female lead's image.

248
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:58,538
I know, I have read the novel.

249
00:16:58,538 --> 00:17:01,125
So this time, I'm not looking to play the female lead.

250
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:03,378
I just really want to work on this film.

251
00:17:03,378 --> 00:17:07,239
I want to try playing the villain.

252
00:17:07,239 --> 00:17:08,699
The villain?

253
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:14,059
Yes. Ever since my debut, I have always played positive roles, showing kindness and integrity.

254
00:17:14,059 --> 00:17:17,459
I want to try different roles and challenge myself.

255
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,840
All right, I will recommend you.

256
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,779
Thank you, President Kang.

257
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,220
I don't think these candidates fit your criteria.

258
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,800
I think Li Meng is the only suitable one so far.

259
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,560
However, she went abroad to act in musicals to advance herself.

260
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:14,260
She probably won't come back anytime soon.

261
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:19,479
Then let's keep looking for candidates with similar vibes to Li Meng.

262
00:18:19,479 --> 00:18:22,139
Other than the female lead, there are still some other female characters.

263
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:26,280
We should also start thinking about that.

264
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:31,179
For the rest of the roles, I think we should select actresses from our company.

265
00:18:32,439 --> 00:18:36,120
That's a good idea. Actually, I want to recommend Han Ruo Xi to join us.

266
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:37,939
Han Ruo Xi as the female lead?

267
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:39,540
Impossible.

268
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:45,559
You are mistaken. Han Ruo Xi said she would like to challenge herself and play the villain.

269
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,740
Did she say she wants to play the villain?

270
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:49,718
President Kang, is she really willing to do that?

271
00:18:49,718 --> 00:18:51,619
Yes!

272
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,779
Miss Su, we've had some misunderstandings before.

273
00:18:59,779 --> 00:19:01,858
However, I've thought things through.

274
00:19:01,858 --> 00:19:04,638
If you could give me this opportunity,

275
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:07,399
I would like to challenge myself with this role.

276
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,860
Are you really willing to?

277
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,840
Yes, I really am.

278
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:19,930
In that case, with your acting skills, you are totally qualified for this role.

279
00:19:20,579 --> 00:19:22,279
Here's to a good cooperation.

280
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,919
I hope we'll have a happy cooperation!

281
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,298
I'll let you get back to your meeting.

282
00:19:28,298 --> 00:19:32,120
- I'll leave now... Bye bye.
- Okay.

283
00:19:39,425 --> 00:19:43,980
Well, then let's pick Luo Xiao Xi as the female lead.

284
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,460
Bo Yan, don't talk nonsense!

285
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:52,280
I think Luo Xiao Xi's temperament and image

286
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,679
are very consistent with that of the female lead.

287
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:56,221
She is your friend too.

288
00:19:56,221 --> 00:19:59,925
I'm sure you two will communicate very well.

289
00:19:59,925 --> 00:20:02,980
It's not a matter of friendship!

290
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,040
Come outside with me!

291
00:20:18,475 --> 00:20:21,880
This might be my first lead role in a film!

292
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,279
I need to prepare for it well!

293
00:20:23,279 --> 00:20:25,960
I can't bring shame to Jian'an.

294
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:28,899
Lu Bo Yan, what do you want?

295
00:20:28,899 --> 00:20:31,819
Why do you have to drag Luo Xiao Xi into this?

296
00:20:33,019 --> 00:20:36,319
Jian'an, Luo Xiao Xi is your friend.

297
00:20:36,319 --> 00:20:38,099
She is also my company's artist.

298
00:20:38,099 --> 00:20:41,679
Also, we all have seen her recent progress, haven't we?

299
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,425
So it makes a lot of sense for me to recommend Luo Xiao Xi.

300
00:20:44,425 --> 00:20:48,058
Besides, aren't you happy to have your best friend play your leading actress?

301
00:20:48,058 --> 00:20:50,359
She is not suitable for this role, though.

302
00:20:50,359 --> 00:20:54,060
To be honest, Xiao Xi cannot act as well as Han Ruo Xi.

303
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,719
Even Han Ruo Xi knows to choose a role that suits her, instead of the lead role.

304
00:20:57,719 --> 00:20:59,638
Why are you messing things up?

305
00:20:59,638 --> 00:21:01,739
Anyway, I think

306
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:04,159
she can do it as long as you're here!

307
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,480
Lu Bo Yan! Why can't you understand?

308
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:08,240
I need to be responsible for my own film!

309
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:12,607
If you insist on making Luo Xiao Xi the lead, you're being ridiculous!

310
00:21:12,607 --> 00:21:14,800
I am done talking with you!

311
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,819
Xiao Xi?

312
00:21:32,879 --> 00:21:34,779
Xiao Xi!

313
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:56,958
Why?

314
00:21:56,958 --> 00:22:00,159
Why can't I be the leading actress?

315
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:16,919
Xiao Xi! I secured many product placement deals for this film!

316
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:19,440
I'm awesome, right?

317
00:22:24,739 --> 00:22:26,339
What's wrong?

318
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,760
What happened?

319
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:36,819
- It's nothing.
- Did someone bully you?

320
00:22:36,819 --> 00:22:39,239
I'm fine. Stop talking.

321
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:43,979
Did someone bully you? Tell me about it!

322
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:51,575
I had no idea that's how Jian'an thinks of me.

323
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:56,300
What about Jian'an? What's going on?

324
00:23:01,399 --> 00:23:07,239
I am truly happy that the novel by Jian'an will be made into a film.

325
00:23:07,239 --> 00:23:12,340
I was even happier that I could act in her film.

326
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,778
I don't want to ruin her work,

327
00:23:14,778 --> 00:23:19,025
and I trained really hard!

328
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:22,799
I wanted to do my best for her,

329
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,150
and I wanted both of us to improve together!

330
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:27,810
She has always been very nice to me.

331
00:23:27,818 --> 00:23:30,810
However, this time, I didn't expect

332
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:35,520
that Jian'an would think it's ridiculous for me to act in her film.

333
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,618
That can't be. Are you mistaken?

334
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:44,699
I heard her say it with my own ears!

335
00:23:44,699 --> 00:23:47,978
It's okay, Xiao Xi. Don't be sad.

336
00:23:47,978 --> 00:23:50,200
I'll ask her about it tomorrow.

337
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,320
It's okay.

338
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,360
Don't cry.

339
00:24:08,679 --> 00:24:10,179
Jian'an.

340
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,299
About Luo Xiao Xi...

341
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,100
Bo Yan, I'm a bit tired today.

342
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,439
Okay, go and get some rest then.

343
00:24:21,439 --> 00:24:26,078
Let's have dinner together tomorrow and talk about it, okay?

344
00:24:26,078 --> 00:24:28,400
Okay, let's talk tomorrow night.

345
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:58,199
Jian'an, cutting a long novel into ninety minutes is indeed quite difficult.

346
00:24:58,199 --> 00:25:00,698
Don't worry. We will find a solution.

347
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:03,958
Yes, Sister Jian'an. You look so pale.

348
00:25:03,958 --> 00:25:05,219
You should get some rest.

349
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:09,275
Yes, there will always be more work for us to do. You need to make sure you get enough rest.

350
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:15,724
All right. Then let's all go back and do some thinking. We'll continue tomorrow.

351
00:25:15,724 --> 00:25:16,679
All right.

352
00:25:16,679 --> 00:25:18,479
Thank you, everyone.

353
00:25:18,479 --> 00:25:20,820
Take a look at this.

354
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:24,882
This is the list of the product placements Shao Kai got for us. They need to be written into the story.

355
00:25:24,882 --> 00:25:26,778
Let's talk if anything comes up.

356
00:25:26,778 --> 00:25:28,379
Okay.

357
00:25:29,179 --> 00:25:31,679
Jian'an, I'll get going now.

358
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,510
[Product Name: Guihe Pills. Company Name: Guihe Pharmaceuticals. Product Type: Chinese Patent Drug]

359
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,410
[Chinese Name: Yueme. Developer: Taoran Yibo Communications and Technology. Type: Messaging, System Requirements, iPhone, iPad, iPod Touch]

360
00:25:45,259 --> 00:25:49,299
Jian'an, what's going on between you and Xiao Xi?

361
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:52,720
Shao Kai, I happen to have something to talk to you about!

362
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:58,199
What kind of product placements are these? Pills and a dating app?

363
00:25:58,199 --> 00:26:00,100
There's even some vodka brand!

364
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,958
Your movie hasn't started filming yet.

365
00:26:01,958 --> 00:26:04,819
We're already considered lucky to get these deals.

366
00:26:04,819 --> 00:26:07,049
What is all this nonsense?

367
00:26:07,049 --> 00:26:10,559
How can I add them in? They're totally different from the tone of this movie!

368
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,619
Just withdraw them all!

369
00:26:16,719 --> 00:26:22,719
Jian'an, I realized you have completely changed ever since working on this movie.

370
00:26:22,719 --> 00:26:27,199
Before, you and Luo Xiao Xi would always support each other no matter what. But what are you doing now?

371
00:26:27,199 --> 00:26:30,139
Do you know how excited Xiao Xi was to act in your film?

372
00:26:30,139 --> 00:26:32,158
She kept telling me she doesn't want to bring you shame!

373
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:34,819
She said she doesn't want to bring you shame! Do you know that?

374
00:26:36,719 --> 00:26:38,340
Are you still our friend?

375
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:40,838
It was not my intention to hurt Xiao Xi!

376
00:26:40,838 --> 00:26:43,338
I will definitely explain everything after this is all over!

377
00:26:43,338 --> 00:26:45,398
You can only see your film now!

378
00:26:45,398 --> 00:26:49,279
Su Jian'an, do you know how much wine I had to drink for your film?

379
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,879
Okay. Since you think I'm causing you trouble

380
00:26:52,879 --> 00:26:54,780
and that Luo Xiao Xi is messing everything up,

381
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:57,919
then all right, I will quit.

382
00:26:58,579 --> 00:27:00,479
I wish you success.

383
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,198
Jiang Shao Kai! It's not what you think!

384
00:27:23,830 --> 00:27:25,950
[Unpleasant]

385
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:43,480
- Are you and Mrs. Lu having dinner tonight?
- Yes.

386
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:51,350
President Lu, if it goes on like this,

387
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,350
you will have to sleep on the sofa.

388
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:58,140
I personally saw your dad doing that a lot back then.

389
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:03,440
Uncle Xu, what do you think I should do?

390
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,259
What should you do?

391
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:08,899
You are asking the right person!

392
00:28:08,899 --> 00:28:13,159
Rather than eating out, you should cook at home.

393
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:15,619
You will appear more sincere.

394
00:28:15,619 --> 00:28:18,499
You're right. Let's start!

395
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,060
Are you having some troubles?

396
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:44,519
No, I just wanted to be alone.

397
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:49,158
It's like this when working on projects.

398
00:28:49,158 --> 00:28:51,198
Often times, people misunderstand us

399
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:52,899
and we get criticized.

400
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:56,475
However, we also don't want to give up or compromise so easily.

401
00:28:56,475 --> 00:29:01,320
Everyone needs to experience this before they realize their dreams.

402
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,719
But it's so hard.

403
00:29:03,719 --> 00:29:07,179
So... at times like this, you need to stay calm.

404
00:29:07,179 --> 00:29:10,120
Things need to be solved one by one.

405
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,659
Let your actions speak for you.

406
00:29:11,659 --> 00:29:14,118
When your work is released,

407
00:29:14,118 --> 00:29:15,918
you can tell the world

408
00:29:15,918 --> 00:29:18,880
that persisting was the right thing to do.

409
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,579
I didn't think of that.

410
00:29:22,579 --> 00:29:26,718
Adjust the way you think. Focus all your energy on the project.

411
00:29:26,718 --> 00:29:31,360
As for the female lead, I asked a friend from overseas to contact Li Meng.

412
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:32,870
Thank you, President Kang.

413
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:35,720
I have really learned a lot from you.

414
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,300
You...

415
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,659
You were busy all day and had no dinner yet, right?

416
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:48,100
I'll treat you to a late-night meal.

417
00:29:48,879 --> 00:29:51,919
It's okay! Bo Yan is still waiting for me at home.

418
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,990
All right, I will drive you back. It's not safe for you to go alone.
