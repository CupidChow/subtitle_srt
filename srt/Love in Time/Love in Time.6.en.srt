00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:15,280
Lu Bo Yan, I think we should make our relationship clear to the public.

14
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:22,459
- That's a good idea!
- You should do an exclusive interview

15
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,480
and clarify that we are cousins.

16
00:01:27,660 --> 00:01:29,120
No way.

- I have a way.
- What is it?

20
00:01:39,319 --> 00:01:43,540
Let's tell the public that we are husband and wife. Problem solved.

21
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:47,379
No! We have an agreement.

Fine. Don't go out for the next few days.

23

I am sorry for what my fans did to you earlier.

- They didn't scare you, did they?
- It's all right, Sister Ruo Xi.

Besides, it's not your fault.

42

It's the fans' fault for being so crazy.

43

These fans are too crazy.

I can't even stop them.

50

This is all because your cousin is a celebrity in this city.

So if you stay at the Lu residence,

52

Sister Ruo Xi, do you have a solution?

54

We see this kind of stuff a lot.

55
00:04:08,825 --> 00:04:12,560
Usually, the public forgets about online news very quickly.

I think the best plan now

61

is for you to hurry up and leave the Lu residence.

62

You can go back after everything is over.

Thank you for attending this conference.

147
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:02,919
The internet culture and entertainment industry

148
00:12:02,919 --> 00:12:06,875
is a field full of creativity and infinite possibilities.

149
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:09,239
And the foundation of this field

150
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:12,620
is composed of countless young creators.

151
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:17,719
These creators are resilient, intelligent and full of personality.

152
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:19,839
But the most important thing is that

153
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,880
they dare to break through and innovate.

154
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:28,179
I happen to know a person just like this.

155
00:12:28,179 --> 00:12:31,259
Next, I want to give you a grand introduction

156
00:12:31,259 --> 00:12:32,999
to the image ambassador of this conference.

157
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,400
The image ambassador?

Was it not said that it would be Han Ruo Xi?

159
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:39,080
At the same time,

160
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,400

00:12:49,419 --> 00:12:51,119
Great!

163
00:12:51,119 --> 00:12:52,139
Beautiful!

164
00:12:52,139 --> 00:12:54,600
- Great!
- They are a perfect match!

165
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,690
S-Su Jian'an?

166
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:00,440
What?
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

167
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:04,780
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

168
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:08,200
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

169
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:12,020
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

170
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,680
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

171
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:20,200
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive the signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

172
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,470
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

173
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,059
Last night, the president of Lu's Media, Lu Bo Yan,

174
00:13:26,059 --> 00:13:31,139
announced that Ms. Su Jian'an is his wife at the press conference.

175
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:32,540
The audience was shocked.

176
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:35,359
- Lu Bo Yan is married!
- Also, the strategy conference's new ambassador

177
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:39,298
was announced as Su Jian'an, instead of Han Ruo Xi.

178
00:13:39,298 --> 00:13:41,875
The press conference was filled with love and surprises.

179
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,740
Su Jian'an is now in the limelight.

180
00:13:50,559 --> 00:13:52,879
My goodness!

181
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:01,598
Lu Bo Yan, look at what you did!

182
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,020
Yesterday's news is circulating throughout the city now!

183
00:14:08,179 --> 00:14:10,979
This tastes good. Try it.

184
00:14:12,979 --> 00:14:17,579
Lu Bo Yan, can I ask what the heck you were thinking?

185
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:20,480
Why did you expose our relationship without my consent?

186
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,239
If you want to continue being harassed, I won't stop you.

187
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,440
You—

188
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:35,820
Did he expose our relationship to protect me?

189
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,719
It's good!

190
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,558
You promised to use the promotional resources for my novel!

191
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,959
Why did you give them to Su Jian'an?

192
00:14:54,925 --> 00:14:57,300
I won't make tea for you again in the future!

193
00:14:58,259 --> 00:15:02,260
Xuan Xuan, don't be unhappy.

194
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,240
Teacher Su Jian'an!

195
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,120
You have arrived.

196
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,150
Yes, President... I have arrived.

197
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:17,340
Today, I have a surprise for you!

198
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,499
Please...

199
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:23,160
Please... please come.

200
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,980
This is the personal office that I prepared for you.

201
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,279
Take a look. Do you like it?

202
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,659
This is too much, President.

203
00:15:35,659 --> 00:15:37,260
I usually don't need to come here to work.

204
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,798
You don't have to give me such a nice working space.

205
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:42,059
It's a waste, is it not?

206
00:15:42,059 --> 00:15:45,379
I still have to prepare one, just in case!

207
00:15:45,379 --> 00:15:48,959
You are the most popular writer in our literature network now.

208
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,179
You deserve this treatment!

209
00:15:51,179 --> 00:15:53,900
Am I the most popular writer?

210
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:57,479
I will personally reveal it to you later at the meeting.

211
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:59,938
Well, sit here for a while! I will get ready.

212
00:15:59,938 --> 00:16:01,319
- Oh, I—
- Hey, hey, hey!

213
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,940
Sit, sit...

214
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,939
I'll go and get prepared.

215
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,519
Sister Jian'an, you are amazing!

216
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:13,278
We wouldn't have known if it wasn't for that report.

217
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,659
Yes, Jian'an.

218
00:16:14,659 --> 00:16:15,719
Congratulations!

219
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,678
Now, you have success in both love and your career.

220
00:16:18,679 --> 00:16:21,000
I'm so jealous!

221
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,900
- Thank you.
- Well!

222
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:25,599
People are indeed different after they become famous.

223
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,924
I don't think any of us need to write anymore. What's the point of working so hard? Teacher Jian'an is enough already.

224
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,300
Am I right, Teacher Jian'an?

225
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:38,360
Our literature network will rely on you from now on!

226
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:42,440
What's that smell? Oh!

227
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,540
Chen Xuan Xuan!

228
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,359
Why did you eat green onions so early in the morning?

229
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,840
I could smell it from far, far away!

230
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,274
Hurry and brush your teeth. Be a good girl.

231
00:16:48,274 --> 00:16:50,040
There's no need for that!

232
00:16:52,379 --> 00:16:55,559
Ignore her. What a witch.

233
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:57,539
I'm fine!

234
00:16:57,539 --> 00:16:59,119
What's going on between you and President Lu?

235
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,658
Did you not agree to keep it a secret? Why does everyone know about it now?

236
00:17:01,658 --> 00:17:03,819
How would I know? You should ask him.

237
00:17:03,819 --> 00:17:05,500
Did you fall for him?

238
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,160
Teacher Jian'an!

239
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,200
- Do you have time to spare?
- Yes.

240
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,000
Good. Let's have a nice little meeting, shall we?

241
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,439
A nice little meeting?

242
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,140
A meeting!

243
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,659
Everyone!

244
00:17:28,659 --> 00:17:30,760
Let me make a big announcement first.

245
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,850
The name of the novel written by Jian'an has officially been changed to

246
00:17:33,850 --> 00:17:36,650
"Young Master Lu's Sweet Wife."

247
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:41,400
In less than a day, the click count is already at a record high.

248
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:44,758
It's the novel with the most popular opening chapter on our network!

249
00:17:44,759 --> 00:17:47,219
Give her a round of applause!

250
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:54,720
President, why didn't you tell me

251
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,719
you changed the title of my novel?

252
00:17:56,719 --> 00:17:59,519
- You...
- Jian'an!

253
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:04,424
It's the executives' decision after careful consideration.

254
00:18:04,424 --> 00:18:08,618
And I even got a fortune teller to look at the title. He says it has the potential to become a big project.

255
00:18:08,618 --> 00:18:10,159
Look at the readers' responses now!

256
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,118
That's the best proof!

257
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:17,119
President, can we not change the novel's name?

258
00:18:17,119 --> 00:18:20,860
Teacher Jian'an! The name is not important.

259
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:24,159
It's just a formality.

260
00:18:24,159 --> 00:18:29,959
It's mainly because it's written so... so... so realistically!

261
00:18:29,959 --> 00:18:31,000
That's why the readers like it.

262
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:36,249
You have this strength so it's only normal that it would go viral!

263
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,060
Everyone, do you agree?

264
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,358
Yes...

265
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,598
It's great!

266
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:42,859
Young Master Lu is Lu Bo Yan.

267
00:18:42,859 --> 00:18:43,899
You are the sweet wife!

268
00:18:43,899 --> 00:18:46,938
Jiang Shao Kai, shut up!

269
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:49,260
Shao Kai!

270
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
Yes!

271
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:53,919
Jian'an is not who she used to be. So you...

272
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,899
you need to stay away from her in the future.

273
00:18:55,899 --> 00:19:00,260
Keep a distance of at least two meters from her.

274
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:01,618
But sh-sh-she—

275
00:19:01,618 --> 00:19:04,259
W-W-Who are you?

276
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:05,840
I—

277
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:09,358
In the future, more people will recognize Teacher Jian'an.

278
00:19:09,359 --> 00:19:11,059
Misunderstandings will be inevitable!

279
00:19:11,059 --> 00:19:16,275
From now on, you... step aside.

280
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:19,839
What? Do you not understand?

281
00:19:19,839 --> 00:19:21,980
You don't want to listen to me, do you?

282
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,879
Two meters! Two meters! Two meters now!

283
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:32,080
All right!

284
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,799
Everyone, keep working hard.

285
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:40,325
Do your best to help our literature network gain more success and create even more new works.

286
00:19:40,325 --> 00:19:45,859
We should find inspiration in our everyday life, just like Jian'an!

287
00:19:45,859 --> 00:19:48,739
- Great—
- My goodness! So much food!

288
00:19:48,739 --> 00:19:51,380
- Who is it?
- Who is that for?

289
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,100
These snacks look so pretty!

290
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:06,419
Our great ancestors told us that creativity originates from life.

291
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,100
I'll go and take a look, too.

292
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:08,899
No.

293
00:20:08,899 --> 00:20:10,779
I will go, too.

294
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:12,980
What food is there? Wait for me!

295
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,979
Wait for me!

296
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:28,559
Please be patient, everyone.

297
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,400
Uncle Xu, what brings you here?

298
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:36,439
Mrs. Lu, these are morning refreshments from President Lu

299
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,599
to celebrate your novel hitting a record high.

300
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,519
Sister Jian'an, your husband is so sweet.

301
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,840
You are very lucky!

302
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,460
Eat up, everyone!

303
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:49,459
- Thank you, Sister Jian'an!
- Thank you...

304
00:20:49,459 --> 00:20:52,060
Thank you!

305
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,100
This is delicious.

306
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,860
- I feel so blessed!
- So tasty.

307
00:20:56,860 --> 00:21:01,499
Mrs. Lu, President Lu asked me to give this to you.

308
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:03,199
Flowers!

309
00:21:03,199 --> 00:21:04,979
Let me help you.

310
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,779
Mrs. Lu, I'll get going now.

311
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:19,299
President Lu said he will pick you up himself later.

312
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:22,040
This is too overboard.

313
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,440
Mrs. Lu, have a nice day.

314
00:21:28,939 --> 00:21:32,039
This is all too much...

315
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:32,920
President!

316
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,600
President Lu was so sincere to treat us all to morning refreshments.

317
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,279
Do you think you should do a nice gesture yourself and treat us to a meal?

318
00:21:41,359 --> 00:21:43,680
- Yes, yes.
- That's right.

319
00:21:45,239 --> 00:21:47,775
So you agree?

320
00:21:47,775 --> 00:21:50,259
Great, great.

321
00:21:50,259 --> 00:21:52,640
Let me tell you...

322
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,418
Let me say something.

323
00:21:56,418 --> 00:21:58,990
Since Mrs. Lu is so rich and respectable, maybe you should treat us

324
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:02,470
to a celebration meal instead?

325
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:06,575
But we won't accept anything too cheap!

326
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:09,880
I told you to brush your teeth. Have you done it yet?

327
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,199
Go!

328
00:22:12,199 --> 00:22:13,679
Everyone, come closer!

329
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,600
I will treat you all to a delicious meal later.

330
00:22:17,659 --> 00:22:20,479
You can order whatever you like.

331
00:22:24,719 --> 00:22:26,658
Jian'an, you need to hold your ground.

332
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:29,698
You can't be swayed by Lu Bo Yan's sugar-coated shell.

333
00:22:29,698 --> 00:22:30,999
Do you understand?

334
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,559
That's impossible. I'm very tough!

335
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:35,520
You still have to be careful!

336
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:39,419
According to my experience, Lu Bo Yan has definitely fallen for you.

337
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:40,479
That isn't good.

338
00:22:40,479 --> 00:22:43,439
Okay, okay. Take a look and see what you want to eat.

339
00:22:43,439 --> 00:22:45,319
Do you like this?

340
00:22:45,319 --> 00:22:47,400
I want this.

341
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,899
- Okay. What about this?
- That's fine, too.

342
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,679
Jian'an, we're done. It's your turn to order now.

343
00:22:52,679 --> 00:22:54,679
All right. Let me take a look...

344
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:55,820
This one! This one is good.

345
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,238
Barbecued pork, pineapple chicken...

346
00:22:57,238 --> 00:22:58,539
Jian'an.

347
00:22:58,539 --> 00:23:00,400
A sandwich

348
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,219
and...

349
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:03,340
And soup dumplings.

350
00:23:16,859 --> 00:23:19,079
You haven't seen me for just one morning.

351
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:21,179
Are you that excited?

352
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,760
Everybody, let me introduce myself.

353
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,620
I'm the husband of Su Jian'an.

354
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:38,360
Please take good care of our Jian'an in the future.

355
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:41,060
Why are you here?

356
00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:44,760
Remember, you are Mrs. Lu.

357
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,300
Be careful with how you behave.

358
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,379
Everybody, I have to leave now.

359
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:52,639
Have a good meal.

360
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,519
Goodbye!

361
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:01,419
Please, please.

362
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:05,019
Be reserved!

363
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,800
Did I not tell you?

364
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,059
Waiter!

365
00:24:10,059 --> 00:24:11,639
I want all of your most expensive dishes!

366
00:24:11,639 --> 00:24:12,840
Xuan Xuan!

367
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,020
Even though Jian'an is treating us, you can't be this brutal.

368
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,639
Jian'an is rich.

369
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,520
You all just saw her husband.

370
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:24,599
If we eat something cheap, it won't match up to Mrs. Lu's identity.

371
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,160
Chen Xuan Xuan, are you—

372
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,459
- What?
- Cut it out.

373
00:24:27,459 --> 00:24:29,359
Forget it.

374
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:35,380
Fine.

375
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,619
You can go now. We'll call you over again later.

376
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,640
Are you all full?

377
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:41,779
Yes, yes...

378
00:24:41,779 --> 00:24:44,480
Waiter! Bill, please.

379
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:51,780
- Hello. Your bill amounts to ¥5891($900 U.S.) in total.
- What?

380
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:52,839
That much?

381
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:56,200
You ordered the most expensive sea cucumber and abalone.

382
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,900
That's why it's a bit more on the expensive side.

383
00:24:57,903 --> 00:25:00,479
Wait a moment.

384
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:02,838
They haven't paid me out in full for my novel yet so I don't have enough money.

385
00:25:02,838 --> 00:25:03,859
Could you pay for me first?

386
00:25:03,859 --> 00:25:05,458
No problem!

387
00:25:05,458 --> 00:25:07,236
You are successful in love and your career now, right?

388
00:25:07,236 --> 00:25:09,160
Can't you even afford a meal?

389
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:10,758
Just tell us if you don't want to treat us.

390
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:14,899
There's a fast food restaurant near our office. We could have gone there if you had told us earlier.

391
00:25:14,899 --> 00:25:19,699
Honey, I came to give you the card.

392
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,940
- It's a black card!
- Oh my gosh!

393
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:26,139
Sister Jian'an, you are so blessed!

394
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,875
If you think it's inconvenient to carry around a card,

395
00:25:31,875 --> 00:25:34,780
I also linked you to my Alipay account just now.

396
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,659
There's no limit.

397
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,400
Will you pay with the card or Alipay?

398
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,679
The card.

399
00:25:42,679 --> 00:25:43,740
All right.

400
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,540
Wait.

401
00:25:46,525 --> 00:25:50,719
That lady will pay her portion herself.

402
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:52,540
Yes, Sir.

403
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,080
Everyone, I have to leave with my wife now.

404
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,579
May I?

405
00:26:01,579 --> 00:26:02,459
Please go ahead.

406
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,100
Miss, here's your card.

407
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,118
Thank you.

408
00:26:05,119 --> 00:26:06,919
Where are we going?

409
00:26:06,919 --> 00:26:09,200
You'll find out when we get there.

410
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,790
Let's go.

411
00:26:16,419 --> 00:26:20,200
What's so amazing about him?

412
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,599
Lu Bo Yan, it's a pity you're not an actor.

413
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:27,659
Why do you think I am acting?

414
00:26:27,659 --> 00:26:30,919
Oh, my goodness! It's Su Jian'an and Lu Bo Yan!

415
00:26:31,899 --> 00:26:33,739
I get to see this CP (couple) in real life!

416
00:26:33,739 --> 00:26:35,560
Oh, my goodness! So sweet!

417
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,600
Yes, yes! You are a wonderful match! My goodness, I've totally fallen for you guys!

418
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,048
You are...

419
00:26:40,048 --> 00:26:42,238
Teacher Little Monster, we are fans of your novel!

420
00:26:42,238 --> 00:26:43,219
Are you fans of my novel?

421
00:26:43,219 --> 00:26:45,319
Yes! We love your novel so much!

422
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:46,938
Good luck! Please keep writing more!

423
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:49,159
We will support the Lu CP forever!

424
00:26:49,159 --> 00:26:52,898
Give us more sweetness in your novel! We love you guys! Finger hearts!

425
00:26:52,898 --> 00:26:54,518
Thank you for supporting my novel.

426
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:57,860
Thank you for loving us.

427
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,799
Thank you. We have to leave now.

428
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,279
- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

429
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:08,219
They're so beautiful together!

430
00:27:13,379 --> 00:27:16,140
My goodness, I actually have fans!

431
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,099
How was it?

432
00:27:17,099 --> 00:27:20,660
How does it feel to be a celebrity?

433
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:23,019
It feels like a dream.

434
00:27:23,019 --> 00:27:26,939
But logically speaking, this buzz will last for only three days.

435
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:28,979
I have to be prepared to see a big contrast.

436
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:31,140
Miss Su, what do you mean only three days?

437
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,079
You're underestimating President Lu!

438
00:27:33,079 --> 00:27:34,318
What do you mean?

439
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,939
President Lu told President Du—

440
00:27:35,939 --> 00:27:37,639
Yue Chuan!

441
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,459
Lu Bo Yan?

442
00:27:48,459 --> 00:27:50,739
You are not fit for this industry.

443
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:53,639
I'll tell Chen Xuan Xuan to talk about the contract termination with you.

444
00:27:53,639 --> 00:27:54,820
Are you giving up so easily?

445
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:55,999
Shen Yue Chuan, why are you here?

446
00:27:55,999 --> 00:27:59,419
Sister-in-law, what a coincidence.

447
00:27:59,419 --> 00:28:03,425
My goodness! It's our talented star!

448
00:28:03,425 --> 00:28:07,020
Did you intercede with President Du on my behalf?

449
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:11,239
Did you invest in our literature network?

450
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:18,539
Lu Bo Yan! Why did you not tell me you did all this?

451
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,379
The investment into the literature network is due to the Lu's Media strategy.

452
00:28:26,379 --> 00:28:28,879
Then what about asking President Du to promote my novel?

453
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,879
What right do you have to meddle with my work?

454
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,839
Yes, I want my novel to be popular,

455
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:37,159
but I want to depend on my own ability, not our relationship!

456
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:39,838
What will my colleagues think of me now?

457
00:28:39,839 --> 00:28:42,740
Jian'an, if your novel wasn't good enough,

458
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:45,480
I wouldn't have asked President Du to promote it.

459
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,319
Are you that kind?

460
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,579
You really don't have to thank me.

461
00:28:54,579 --> 00:28:57,419
You wrote a good novel. That's why the traffic increased.

462
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:00,379
Ultimately, Lu's Media is the one that benefits from it.

463
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:02,100
I knew it.

464
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:05,020
You must have other intentions.

465
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:13,100
Actually, I have a lot of intentions for you.

466
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,639
Wow, there are a lot of good snacks here!

467
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:31,040
What do you like?

468
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:34,339
I like everything you like so take whatever you want.

469
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,560
This was your childhood favorite, right?

470
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,020
I'll get two cans for you.

471
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:39,239
Do you still remember that?

472
00:29:39,239 --> 00:29:40,940
Of course!

473
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,218
They have these too!

474
00:29:42,218 --> 00:29:44,260
These are Xiao Xi's favorites!

475
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,459
I don't know what to pick... Hey! Those potato chips!

476
00:29:47,459 --> 00:29:48,639
I want two of them!

477
00:29:48,639 --> 00:29:49,598
I love those the most.

478
00:29:49,599 --> 00:29:51,039
- This one?
- Yes!

479
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,139
Not only do I love them,

480
00:29:52,139 --> 00:29:54,780
Jiang Shao Kai loves them, too!

481
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,060
This is enough.

482
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,259
Why are you putting those back?

483
00:30:00,259 --> 00:30:01,639
Eating potato chips will give you excessive internal heat.

484
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,239
But I love those chips!

485
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:05,500
- Eat something else.
- I want two packs!

486
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,500
You already have enough snacks here. Let's get some drinks.

487
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,218
Is this Nutri-Express? They have a new product!

488
00:30:10,218 --> 00:30:11,700
- Do you like this?
- Yes.

489
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:12,679
Get a few more bottles.

490
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:14,080
Okay.

491
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,300
Let's get soda too.

492
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,860
- Let's go, let's go!
- Let's go!

493
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:22,220
Don't eat so much of that. It's not good for your health if you eat too much.

494
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,040
I'll get two packs!

495
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,380
What do you want to do?

496
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,700
Don't cross the line.

497
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:00,659
Did we not agree we have to make it look real?

498
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,319
Get off me!

499
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,919
Dad, good going.

500
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,960
You launched a new style again!

501
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:42,798
This one is better than the one you wore last time.

502
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,520
Try it.

503
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:45,758
I don't want to!

504
00:31:45,759 --> 00:31:47,399
Wear it yourself!

505
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:49,600
All right, I should support my father-in-law's products.

506
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,480
That's fine as well.

507
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,279
Let's go... Xiao Xi is waiting for me.

508
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,300
Let me try it.

509
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:57,000
Let's go! Go!

510
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:00,319
Oh, wait a minute! I forgot something.

511
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:01,301
Wait here for me.

512
00:32:01,301 --> 00:32:02,940
All right.

513
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:08,459
Hello, there's something I want. Could you help me?

514
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:09,679
Okay.

515
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:13,480
I would like to add this handsome guy on WeChat.

516
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:20,919
Handsome, are you going to be so cold-hearted and reject me?

517
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:25,739
Do you have a problem?

518
00:32:25,739 --> 00:32:29,579
Sister, I just want his contact information.

519
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:31,350
May I have it?

520
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:33,540
You cannot!

521
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:37,975
If you call me "Sister," you should call him '"Brother-in-law."

522
00:32:43,459 --> 00:32:47,019
Mrs. Lu, you're jealous, aren't you?

523
00:32:47,019 --> 00:32:50,619
- Did someone not say we should make our act look real?
- Yes, right.

524
00:32:52,219 --> 00:32:54,119
Pay the bill.

525
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,700
Congratulations, your novel has finally shot to popularity!

526
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,299
You even read my romance novel too?

527
00:33:02,299 --> 00:33:04,419
It's surely different from your usual genre.

528
00:33:04,419 --> 00:33:06,879
I am sincerely happy for you!

529
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:08,139
I didn't see it coming, either.

530
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,260
It's like a dream.

531
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:12,999
Many fans have left messages

532
00:33:12,999 --> 00:33:14,679
saying they hope to build a readers' group.

533
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:16,720
A readers' group?

534
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,579
But I haven't made one before.

535
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:21,339
I can help you.

536
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:24,299
Really? That's great!

537
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:28,280
Now, we need to give the group a name.

538
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:31,539
I hate thinking of names.

539
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:34,120
Let's call it "Monster League."

540
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:39,759
That's a good one!

541
00:33:46,119 --> 00:33:49,520
After making the high-profile announcement of their marriage yesterday,

542
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,160
the president of Lu's Media took his wife to the supermarket.

543
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:56,300
Their sweet interactions seem just like in an idol drama.

544
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,419
They keep bringing us sweet moments, one after another. It's so enviable!

545
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,978
Our famous writer is so popular now.

546
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:15,380
Let me be your agent.

547
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:18,118
Stop teasing me. I'm so troubled.

548
00:34:18,118 --> 00:34:20,499
Why?

549
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:22,638
But let me tell you,

550
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,820
President Lu's performance these days really has impressed me.

551
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:27,359
That's what I'm talking about.

552
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,880
I really don't know what he is playing at!

553
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,320
Are you stupid?

554
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,858
Look at him. To prove your innocence,

555
00:34:33,858 --> 00:34:35,598
he replaced Han Ruo Xi with you at the press conference.

556
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,558
He even disclosed your relationship to the public.

557
00:34:37,559 --> 00:34:39,439
He acts affectionate with you in public,

558
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,440
and he even gave you a black card!

559
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,399
What does all this mean?

560
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,598
What?

561
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:47,099
It means you're in his heart!

562
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:50,250
Anyway, I don't understand what kind of person he is.

563
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:53,680
Why are you so paranoid?

564
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,759
After all, it's a contractual marriage.

565
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,879
Who knows if he has other intentions?

566
00:34:57,879 --> 00:35:00,118
Come on. Your novel is so popular now,

567
00:35:00,118 --> 00:35:01,959
and President Lu spoils you so much.

568
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:04,359
You have reached the peak of your life!

569
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,299
Is this already the peak of my life?

570
00:35:06,299 --> 00:35:09,679
Then I can only go down from here now.

571
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:10,780
Nonsense!

572
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,580
Can you not think normally?

573
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:17,019
What the heck is in your head all day?

574
00:35:17,019 --> 00:35:20,879
To be honest, I really envy you.

575
00:35:20,879 --> 00:35:25,059
I still don't know what I want to do now.

576
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,919
Don't worry, take it easy.

577
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:30,275
You will find your life's goal someday.

578
00:35:30,275 --> 00:35:32,198
I hope so, too.

579
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:35,699
Come on. Here's to me finding my life's goal soon!

580
00:35:35,699 --> 00:35:38,180
- Absolutely!
- Absolutely!

581
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:17,539
I should give this back to him.

582
00:36:25,939 --> 00:36:28,720
President Lu, the project research report on Yong'an has come out.

583
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,319
Great. Continue to follow up on that.

584
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,160
Why are you here?

585
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,239
I am here to see you, of course.

586
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:52,160
Bo Yan, you got married,

587
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,919
but I was the last one to know.

588
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:59,394
The wedding was a little rushed. We didn't plan anything.

589
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,540
Time flies so fast.

590
00:37:04,439 --> 00:37:09,275
In the blink of an eye, we have worked together for more than four years already.

591
00:37:09,275 --> 00:37:13,600
Do you remember what the media said about us back then?

592
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:21,138
They said we were the perfect match.

593
00:37:21,138 --> 00:37:23,219
What are you trying to say?

594
00:37:27,959 --> 00:37:31,319
Su Jian'an said she was your cousin.

595
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:33,759
At the press conference, you said you were married.

596
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,750
So in reality, you are not really married.

597
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:40,040
Explain the contract.

598
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,019
You have your reasons, right?

599
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,478
If you really want to know, I will tell you.

600
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,739
We are indeed in a contractual marriage.
