00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:18,678
Come! Mealtime! Come! Come!

13
00:01:18,678 --> 00:01:21,339
Come! First come, first served! Don't be late!

14
00:01:21,339 --> 00:01:22,899
Okay, you should go have lunch now.

15
00:01:22,899 --> 00:01:24,919
We will talk later. Okay?

16
00:01:36,339 --> 00:01:37,960
Okay, next one!

17
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,519
Noodles with tofu and green vegetables.

18
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,399
Let's go. Let's go.

19
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,440
How can I eat this?

20
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,680
It's sour!

21
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,360
"Juvenile," stop right there.

22
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,800
What were you thinking? Is this what you give us to eat?

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,119
- You embezzled the money, right?
- Calm down.

24
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:02,140
No, the crew really does not have much money.

25
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,060
So what do you eat?

26
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:06,759
Do you have money for coffee?

27
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:08,439
You have noodles.

28
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:11,640
But I can only have some instant coffee.

29
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,439
Jian'an, I really don't want to eat this. Look at the noodles.

30
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:17,360
They look like scraps of paper.

31
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,840
I just can't get them through my throat.

32
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,120
I have a bag of mustard.

33
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,840
Get it out!

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,519
Sister, it's time to eat.

35
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:39,799
You should eat some.

36
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:46,890
Director, do you really believe this is food for people?

37
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,040
Throughout my life of filming, I have never had such a bad meal!

38
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,819
Sister, it's your boss' movie.

39
00:02:52,819 --> 00:02:56,119
I don't care. I can't work unless I get to eat four dishes and one soup.

40
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,719
Sister, take a look.

41
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:01,080
Look at mine.

42
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:04,280
Yours is better than mine. You still got some meat, right?

43
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,480
Sister, don't argue with me about trivial matters.

44
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,398
If you are not satisfied with the meal, you can talk to President Kang.

45
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,640
And how could I even buy dishes in the middle of the wilderness?

46
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,358
For the sake of art, please bear with it.

47
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,580
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:19,700
Sister, here.

49
00:03:25,679 --> 00:03:28,540
Su Jian'an, your takeout!

50
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,420
Wow.

51
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:21,099
Jian'an, when did you order takeout?

52
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:22,500
I didn't.

53
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,759
How can you order takeout in this wilderness?

54
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,959
That's so great.

55
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,690
Would you like to come and eat with me?

56
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,579
Yes!

57
00:05:48,579 --> 00:05:49,899
Director, come!

58
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:53,139
Coming! Coming!

59
00:05:54,519 --> 00:05:56,399
It's so delicious.

60
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,120
Give me that one.

61
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:10,999
Thank you, Brother Bear!

62
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:14,160
Brother Bear, come back tomorrow and bring more!

63
00:06:16,475 --> 00:06:20,100
Did President Lu send the bear?

64
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:27,959
That was the best meal I've ever had at a filming site.

65
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,559
It was great.

66
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:33,579
Director, it's time for work, right?

67
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,100
- Yes, back to work now. Go!
- Back to work!

68
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,310
Go!

69
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:56,479
Did Lu Bo Yan send the bear?

70
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,819
My gosh, it's so hot.

71
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:04,559
Hurry. Help me take it off.

72
00:07:04,559 --> 00:07:06,259
Okay. Okay.

73
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:08,839
Gosh.

74
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,120
Jian'an is calling.

75
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,720
- Hurry.
- Get it off.

76
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,620
Wait. Not this.

77
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,320
The right side.

78
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,878
President Lu, don't move.

79
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,679
President Lu. I've got it.

80
00:07:19,679 --> 00:07:21,199
Hurry.

81
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,699
Quick, answer it.

82
00:07:23,119 --> 00:07:24,639
Hello, Miss Su.

83
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,920
Hello. Where is Bo Yan?

84
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,601
President Lu is busy now

85
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:30,960
so I answered the phone for him.

86
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,140
Put him on the phone.

87
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:38,860
- Me?
- Quick, talk to her.

88
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,980
Hello?

89
00:07:46,439 --> 00:07:48,139
Thank you for the lunch.

90
00:07:48,139 --> 00:07:49,939
It was delicious.

91
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,799
Did I interrupt your work?

92
00:07:53,799 --> 00:07:55,559
If you liked it,

93
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:57,160
I can arrange this for you every day.

94
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,960
Okay.

95
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:01,479
Okay.

96
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,240
What did she say?

97
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:09,280
That's great.

98
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,379
She doesn't know it was me.

99
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,719
Brilliant.

100
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:16,419
- Take it off.
- Okay.

101
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,559
Hurry. Hurry.

102
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:21,899
Be careful with the equipment. Come here.

It's raining. Come on.

104
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:26,699
Come stand underneath.

105
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:29,430
It's rainy.

106
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,770
It's full here,

107
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,040
I am sorry.

108
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,758

- Staff members, come here.
- Come, come.

We don't have enough people for the crowd today. It's a scene on the street.

00:10:43,998 --> 00:10:47,099
We need men and women. Come, Brother Bear. Come.

Brother Bear, you and Jian'an... You will be lovers.

I did.

162
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,458
President. Here's your tea.

I won't allow you to join the crew.

00:13:02,159 --> 00:13:04,359
President, you are making a mistake.

168
00:13:04,359 --> 00:13:08,775
I have a good cooperation plan to discuss with you today.

169
00:13:08,775 --> 00:13:12,420
Harder, harder... Say it.

170
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,179
They started filming "When Time Stops."

171
00:13:15,179 --> 00:13:17,059
With popular actress, Han Ruo Xi,

172
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:20,350
and your good friend, the famous Director Guo,

173
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,224
it's going to be a blockbuster.

174
00:13:22,224 --> 00:13:25,219
I think we should get the movie rights for the novel.

175
00:13:25,219 --> 00:13:30,650
It's to be expected that the movie's fans will visit our website.

176
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:34,250
Our website will have more traffic.

177
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,758
I think you are right.

178
00:13:36,758 --> 00:13:41,550
But then the novel's development will require more money.

179
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:46,478
President. You may not know this,

180
00:13:46,478 --> 00:13:49,999
but our partners are complaining that our website

181
00:13:49,999 --> 00:13:52,318
has no novels that can be adapted.

182
00:13:52,318 --> 00:13:54,919
We don't have enough fans or influence.

183
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:59,639
If we have the movie's copyrights, then what will happen? The problem will be solved.

184
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:02,919
Then I will persuade them with this opportunity.

185
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:06,178
They will incorporate related products into the film and our novel.

186
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:09,740
We won't spend any money. Until then, they will even increase the budget.

187
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:12,020
How awesome!

188
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:17,120
Who allowed you to sit here? Get up. Give me a massage.

189

Let me tell you,

if you can do this,

191
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,339
I will have no objection.

192
00:14:24,339 --> 00:14:27,959
- Great!
- Be gentle! Be gentle!

193
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,239

Wow, President Lu, your routine is so romantic.

197
00:14:42,975 --> 00:14:45,978
You promised me you wouldn't come. Why are you here?

198
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:49,819
Of course... it's because you are here.

199
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,720
Oh, right. Xiao Xi, I really want to thank you.

200
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,600
Thank you for taking care of Jian'an all this time.

201
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,479
You are more than welcome.

202
00:15:04,479 --> 00:15:07,419
Sorry for the interruption. Here's the crayfish.

203

- Enjoy.
- It's my favorite: crayfish.

Eat up now.

You can't eat spicy food.

206
00:15:12,999 --> 00:15:15,740
I ordered it for you.

207

You don't need to wear those. I'll do it.

You are so affectionate after a short separation.

Don't overdo it.

Do you like it? I'll get more for you.

Enough!

No. I'm sober. I want to see you.

We may not get the follow-up investment.

00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:15,480
why didn't you tell me that Kang Rui Cheng is the investor?

301

I want to take Jian'an away from here.

314

I will pay you the liquidated damages.

315
00:22:14,739 --> 00:22:18,019
President Lu, you should discuss this with Su.

316
00:22:18,019 --> 00:22:21,140
We are just business partners.

317
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:24,400
If it's what she wants, I have no objections.

318

We are just business competitors.

319
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,819
Don't get Jian'an involved.

320
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:36,575
So do you not trust me, or do you have no confidence in yourself?

321

As long as the work isn't finished, how can I just leave?

328

If I go now, I will feel bad for them.

329

Hold on.

00:23:13,481 --> 00:23:15,920
It's quite important. What should I do?

333
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,598
You have been staying here for many days.

334
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:19,038
You can't delay your work.

335
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,100
You should go back.

336
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,940
I am doing fine here.

337
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,140
Don't worry.

338
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:28,859
Okay.

339
00:23:28,859 --> 00:23:30,919
Book a ticket for me for tonight.

340
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:32,319
Okay.

341
00:23:37,599 --> 00:23:39,099
Jian'an,

342
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:41,559
promise me,

343
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:43,319
don't push yourself so hard.

344
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,320
Your health is more important than anything else.

345
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:49,940
And if something happens, tell me right away, okay?

346
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,579
Okay, I know.

347
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:56,719
Don't worry.

348
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,225
Goodbye.

349
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,759
You don't need to see me out.

350
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,579
President Lu, are you leaving this soon?

351
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:33,319
Xiao Xi, I'd like to ask you a favor.

352
00:24:33,319 --> 00:24:36,659
No problem. Just tell me.

353
00:24:37,125 --> 00:24:39,040
I am worried about Jian'an,

354
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,950
and I hope you can take care of her for me.

355
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,819
Do not worry. Jian'an is my best friend.

356
00:24:44,819 --> 00:24:47,721
I would take care of her even if you wouldn't tell me to.

357
00:24:47,721 --> 00:24:49,798
- Contact me anytime.
- Okay.

358
00:24:49,798 --> 00:24:51,300
Thank you.

359
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,839
I will send you whatever the Director wants.

360
00:25:02,839 --> 00:25:05,619
Jiang Shao Kai. What are you doing here?

361
00:25:05,619 --> 00:25:09,079
Jian'an. Sit down, sit down.

362
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:11,680
This is a high-end product placement.

363
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,700
I hope the screenwriter will cooperate with me.

364
00:25:19,499 --> 00:25:21,619
What do you think?

365
00:25:29,950 --> 00:25:32,259
What is this cr*p?

366
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:35,078
It's not suitable for our movie at all.

367
00:25:35,079 --> 00:25:36,040
Why not?

368
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,080
I think it's very suitable.

369
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,280
Our movie is in the category of a romantic fantasy.

370
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,990
Can you imagine one being romantic,

371
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,420
and the other using an electric tricycle?

372
00:25:46,425 --> 00:25:49,459
That would be so strange!

373
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,159
Jian'an, because something inevitable happened,

374
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,959
we need to incorporate these products.

375
00:26:04,959 --> 00:26:06,598
You need to revise the script again.

376
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,199
Okay?

377
00:26:10,939 --> 00:26:12,879
Okay, I will think about it.

378
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,700
Okay. Dan Dan, let's go.

379
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:19,575
You two can discuss the details.

380
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:29,319
Jiang Shao Kai, how could I write in these products?

381
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:31,698
Jian'an, you may not know this, but

382
00:26:31,698 --> 00:26:36,349
it is very difficult for me to convince President Du to buy the copyright for the film adaptation.

383
00:26:36,349 --> 00:26:38,080
Please, help me.

384
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,479
- For Luo Xiao Xi?
- Yes.

385
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:45,380
T-T-This is a task, assigned by president Du.

386
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:48,779
Are you still denying it? I won't revise it.

387
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,300
No, no.

388
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:54,719
Jian'an, do you know how much wine I have drunk for this?

389
00:26:54,719 --> 00:26:56,598
That is none of my business.

390
00:26:56,598 --> 00:26:58,558
I did it also for you.

391
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:01,859
Is it for me? I think it's for Luo Xiao Xi.

392
00:27:01,859 --> 00:27:07,859
I... I want to gain more exposure and wages for her.

393
00:27:08,739 --> 00:27:13,139
Okay. Say it. When are you going to see her?

394
00:27:13,139 --> 00:27:17,549
Not now. For the moment this is a secret.

395
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,039
I can't change the advertisement word.

396
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:32,119
What should I do?

397
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:35,775
Jiang Shao Kai is such a troublemaker.

398
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,700
I have no alternatives.

399
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,260
Be careful.

400
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,360
Director, I think that in this scene, I am a spy.

401
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,318
However, I still need to do my best to save Feng Feng.

402
00:28:00,318 --> 00:28:03,738
I drive fast in a sports car, and I care about his injury.

403
00:28:03,738 --> 00:28:07,124
So the audience will have a good impression of me before my identity is exposed.

404
00:28:07,124 --> 00:28:08,598
What do you think of that, Director?

405
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,580
You have a great idea.

406
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,739
Then when will Feng Feng come?

407
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:16,339
Oh, no. Are you his fan?

408
00:28:16,339 --> 00:28:19,440
Yes, he's one of my idols.

409
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,279
Director. This is the revised leaflet.

410
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,760
- Okay. Thank you, Jian'an. Executive!
- Yes?

411
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:30,318
- Come, distribute this.
- For your work, did you revise the script again?

412
00:28:30,318 --> 00:28:31,619
Product placement.

413
00:28:31,619 --> 00:28:33,519
Okay.

414
00:28:36,375 --> 00:28:39,820
You said it was a black sports car, didn't you?

415
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:44,180
- Placement.
- And the thing whizzes into the night.

416
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,720
Hey, Xiao Xi. Now is the time to test your acting skills.

417
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,910
You should drive like it's "Fast and Furious."

418
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:53,175
Come, get ready!

419
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,559
What the heck!

420
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:06,338
Ling Feng, get in the car! Hurry, I'm flying!

421
00:29:06,338 --> 00:29:12,178
D*mn it, they are coming! Hold on to me! Hold me tight. I'm going to increase the speed!

422
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:13,919
Head down!

423
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,900
Jian'an, let me tell you. Your plan to increase laughter is a success.

424
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,560
Hurry!

425
00:29:20,419 --> 00:29:22,099
Get ready to die!

426
00:29:23,259 --> 00:29:25,560
- What kind of weapon is this?
- This is a newly developed weapon.

427
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:29,519
The Bulletproof Pan. Now I can finally use it.

428
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,500
And it's a non-stick, smoke-free pan.

429
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:37,080
Scene One, Take One.

430
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,500
Get ready. Three, two, one. Action!

431
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,078
I disguise myself into Yu Tong using supernatural powers

432
00:29:43,078 --> 00:29:45,640
so I can sneak into Ruo Xue's team.

433
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,799
But rumor has it that Yu Tong has porcelain skin,

434
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,680
which ordinary people don't have.

435
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,318
That's easy.

436
00:29:52,318 --> 00:29:56,850
I know the secret behind her porcelain skin.

437
00:29:56,850 --> 00:30:00,078
With this mask, I can say "goodbye" to dry skin.

438
00:30:00,079 --> 00:30:01,999
The moisturization can last a long time.

439
00:30:01,999 --> 00:30:04,280
Men can use it, too.

440
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:16,141
Jian'an, I think my career as an actress is about to end.

441
00:30:16,141 --> 00:30:20,199
I've done my best to meet the requirements of the advertiser.

442
00:30:20,199 --> 00:30:22,400
I don't blame you.

443
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,459
Tell me, who got the placement?

444
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:26,840
It was...

445
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,579
Luo Xiao Xi!

446
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,479
Jiang Shao Kai.

447
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:34,300
Why are you here?

448
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,600
I... dropped by.

449
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,240
- These are for you.
- Wow!

450
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,920
- Thank you.
- How did you like my product placement?

451
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,900
- Was that your doing?
- Yes.

452
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:49,675
With these placements, your exposure will rise.

453
00:30:49,675 --> 00:30:52,360
You might become a product endorser.

454
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:54,360
Do you have any reward for me?

455
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:57,780
Thank you. I will reward you well.

456
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:01,479
Rotten placements! Do you want to get me more fans?

457
00:31:01,479 --> 00:31:03,458
An endorser?

458
00:31:03,458 --> 00:31:06,100
- Scr*w you!
- Stop hitting me.

459
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,519
Come here!

460
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:19,900
He came all the way to see you.

461
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,939
You just left him there alone. Is that okay?

462
00:31:21,939 --> 00:31:25,379
Don't mention him in front of me. I don't want to see him now.

463
00:31:25,379 --> 00:31:28,320
Actually, Jiang Shao Kai just wants to help you.

464
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,019
Help me? How troublesome.

465
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,159
You may not know, but in order to see you,

466
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,659
he drank a lot to get the product placements for you.

467
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:38,819
You should be nice to him.

468
00:31:38,819 --> 00:31:41,559
Did he do that for me?

469
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,479
Then for who else?

470
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,719
Xiao Xi.

471
00:31:56,125 --> 00:32:01,075
I'm sorry I am not thoughtful.

472
00:32:01,075 --> 00:32:04,019
- Forget it. It's over.
- Really?

473
00:32:04,019 --> 00:32:05,418
I am too generous.

474
00:32:05,418 --> 00:32:07,339
We haven't seen each other for so long.

475
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:11,940
I brought a bottle of wine. Let's have a little drink.

476
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,960
A drink?

477
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:15,240
No way!

478
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I need to work early tomorrow. You should go back now.

479
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,580
Wait. Don't go.

480
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,719
Where am I going to sleep tonight?

481
00:32:22,719 --> 00:32:25,580
Go to a hotel by yourself.

482
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:27,459
To a hotel?

483
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,500
Hello, President Kang.

484
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,220
Okay. Okay, I will go there now.

485
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,539
Do you think it's okay if I revise it like this?

486
00:32:47,539 --> 00:32:48,719
It's okay.

487
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:51,900
Director, President Kang, both of you are here. Is there a problem?

488
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,739
Miss Su, please take a seat.

489
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:04,199
We have a problem with the capital chain (finances) for the project.

490
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:09,419
So I invited you over to ask you for a favor.

491
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,610
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

492
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:34,010
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

493
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:38,720
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

494
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,870
♫ Yes ♫

495
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:42,530
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

496
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:46,870
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

497
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:50,430
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

498
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:54,190
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

499
00:33:54,190 --> 00:33:56,810
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

500
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,500
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

501
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,400
♫ The signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

502
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,130
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

503
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:08,630
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

504
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:11,940
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

505
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:17,680
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

506
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,400
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

507
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:24,090
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

508
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:26,860
♫ Warning all problems ♫

509
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:28,600
♫ To stay away from us ♫

510
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:32,340
♫ No one can take my place ♫

511
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:36,160
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

512
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:39,110
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

513
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:45,470
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
