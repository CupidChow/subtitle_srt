00:12:14,219 --> 00:12:16,898
- Are you Su Jian'an?
- Yes, that's me.

161
00:12:16,898 --> 00:12:18,499
You are Sister Xuan Xuan, right?

162
00:12:18,499 --> 00:12:19,900
Nice to meet you.

163
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,459
President Du has no appointment with you today.

164
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:24,580
He has a guest. You should come back next time.

165
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,619
When will the next time be?

166
00:12:26,619 --> 00:12:28,419
Wait for a notice.

167
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:38,058
Hello, who are you?

168
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:41,978
Hi, I am a writer of your Taoran Literature Network.

169
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,980
This is the president, right?

170
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,820
Hello, President.

171
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:49,259
As I know, you want to pause my novel serialization

172
00:12:49,259 --> 00:12:50,838
so I came back here.

173
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,224
I just want to ask you in person.

174
00:12:53,225 --> 00:12:55,779
Why did you pause my serialization so suddenly?

175
00:12:55,779 --> 00:12:57,339
Miss, you are mistaken.

176
00:12:57,339 --> 00:12:59,799
Only because of the sponsorship fees, right?

177
00:12:59,799 --> 00:13:01,578
Sorry, it is none of our business.

178
00:13:01,578 --> 00:13:05,259
President, you need to give me an explanation.

179
00:13:05,259 --> 00:13:07,499
Otherwise, we are not done here.

180
00:13:10,939 --> 00:13:14,620
Lu Bo Yan, why are you here?

181
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,000
Why can't I be here?

182
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,519
By the way, "Lin Nan's Murder"... are you the author?

183
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,120
Yes. What's wrong?

184
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,939
Oh, I see. You signed the contract with me.

185
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:31,959
You told me you value my writing and talent. It's all lies, right?

186
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:33,958
No wonder you don't publicize my novel.

187
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:36,519
You want to mock me, right?

188
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:39,140
Lu Bo Yan, I am not done with you!

189
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,440
What are you looking at? I'm talking to you.

190
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:44,140
Give me a reasonable explanation.

191
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:46,699
Are you deaf?

192
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:51,939
Why are you still unchanged, so unreasonable?

193
00:13:51,939 --> 00:13:53,879
Am I unreasonable?

194
00:13:53,879 --> 00:13:55,399
Who on Earth is unreasonable?

195
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:58,398
You paused my novel and even set the trap for me with my dad.

196
00:13:58,398 --> 00:14:02,079
Lu Bo Yan, let me tell you. You will regret it!

197
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,699
Jian'an, can you be my girlfriend?

198
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:26,918
Yes!

199
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:29,199
You two, come out. Remember to invite me to dinner.

200

I lost again.

Hey, Su Jian'an. Did you believe Wang's words?

202
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,620
Su Jian'an, is your brain filled with fat?

203
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,060
Su Jian'an!

204
00:14:45,299 --> 00:14:48,260
Jian'an, are you okay?

205
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,679
Are you sad?

206
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:54,000
None of your business. What's the problem?

207
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,819
Jian'an, we are going to graduate.

208
00:15:04,819 --> 00:15:06,960
Now, I gather the courage to face you.

209
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,960
- I want to tell you out loud–
- Lu Bo Yan!

210
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,778
Do you want to mock me as well?

211
00:15:13,778 --> 00:15:16,440
I hate you!

212
00:15:23,879 --> 00:15:26,279
What's wrong, President Lu?

213
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:29,599
Are you not satisfied with the valuation of our company?

214
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:33,919
No, I think the value is very reasonable.

215
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:37,599
Geez. You scared me to death.

216
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:42,399
We can sign the investment agreement in five days.

217
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,919
I will be waiting for you.

218
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:52,320
President Lu, do you participate in our activity?

219
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,019
I will ask Xuan Xuan to send you more sets.

220
00:15:55,019 --> 00:15:56,219
No.

221
00:15:56,219 --> 00:15:59,420
I have been reading a novel from your company,

222
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,000
"Lin Nan's Murder,"

223
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,320
but... I can't find it anymore.

224
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,450
That's because the sponsor wants an activity on the novel's page.

225
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:13,880
I will tell them to resume the update immediately.

226
00:16:15,579 --> 00:16:18,578
- Sounds fine.
- Okay, President Lu.

227
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:21,260
- President Du, you don't have to walk us out.
- Fine, fine.

228
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:24,630
Okay, take care. Bye bye.

00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,479
Writer, what's wrong?

231
00:16:32,479 --> 00:16:35,199
Why did the novel's page become a lingerie giveaway?

232
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,738
I am so sorry. The novel may be paused

233
00:16:37,738 --> 00:16:39,824
if I can't find a man to marry in several hours.

234
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:41,759
Then I will be forced to inherit the family business.

235

You can go to the blind date corner in the park for a flash marriage.

236
00:16:44,239 --> 00:16:45,899
Good idea.

If I can't find a marriage partner, I will be the lingerie queen.

I think it's great to be the lingerie queen.

You have changed a lot.

329
00:23:11,418 --> 00:23:14,938
I said you were a beauty since childhood.

330
00:23:14,938 --> 00:23:17,139
Of course.

331
00:23:17,139 --> 00:23:19,798
Aunt Tang, this is my best friend, Xiao Xi.

- Nice to meet you, Aunt Tang.
- Nice to meet you, too.

333

Why are you here?

- We...
- Well,

Aunt Tang, you are looking for a wife for your son, right?

336
00:23:29,719 --> 00:23:34,519
Yes, my son has known Jian'an since childhood.

337
00:23:34,519 --> 00:23:37,099
Yes, she is a simple, very nice simple girl.

00:23:37,099 --> 00:23:39,759
Jian'an, are you single?

339
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,079
Aunt Tang, I have to go now. You should have a nice talk.

340
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:49,079
Jian'an, have a good chat with Aunt Tang. Bye.

You and Bo Yan are both grown up.

343
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:58,519
I still remember when you were little.

344
00:23:58,519 --> 00:24:01,080
You were good friends, right?

345
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:05,660
Lu Bo Yan was good to me during my childhood.

346

I heard you went to work in another city after graduation.

I barely got to see you.

- Mom.
- Bo Yan.

352
00:24:29,699 --> 00:24:33,179
Of course. It's Lu Bo Yan. Who else could it be?

353
00:24:34,275 --> 00:24:37,476
What's the matter? Won't you welcome me?

354
00:24:38,699 --> 00:24:42,078
Welcome. I welcome you warmly.

355
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:47,475
I really didn't expect you would be so slim.

356

Thank you.

Does no one want to be the deskmate of Su Jian'an?

358
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:07,759
- Teacher, I will be her deskmate.
- Okay.

359

That's all for today. Students, the class is over.

From now on, Su Jian'an will be my deskmate.

I think he is rather good.

Let me go. Otherwise, I'll tell Aunt Tang that you're bullying me.

483
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,740
You want to tell my mom

484
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:34,458
I'm bullying you in this room, right?

485
00:33:34,458 --> 00:33:36,059
You...

486
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,660
Sorry, I forgot my bag.

487
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,358
- You can continue. I'm leaving.
- Go on, go on.

488
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,239
Go on.

489
00:33:49,079 --> 00:33:51,279
Don't push it.

490
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:56,439
Blame... your dad.

491
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,019
You want to take advantage of me.

492
00:34:05,939 --> 00:34:08,839
I forgot to take my bag, too

493
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,978
- Mom.
- Yes.

494
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,859
Leave the room card.

495
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,699
Okay.

496
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,340
Rogue.

497
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:40,738
Don't worry. I am not interested in little girls.

498
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:44,720
What little girl? I am twenty-five!

499
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:47,540
You look like you're five years old.

500
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:49,620
- You are as childish as a five-year-old.
- Oh.

501
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,998
- We are a perfect match.
- You–

502
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:54,539
Okay, let's talk business.

503
00:34:56,839 --> 00:34:58,539
I will marry you.

504
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:08,939
No. Your girlfriend is Han Ruo Xi, right?

505
00:35:08,939 --> 00:35:13,479
Everyone knows this. I don't want to be a mistress.

506
00:35:13,479 --> 00:35:16,059
It's a hidden marriage. No one will know.

507
00:35:16,059 --> 00:35:19,359
No way. You are the last man I want to marry.

508
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,779
Why?

509
00:35:20,779 --> 00:35:24,840
Because you tarnished my love for literature.

510
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:31,739
Are you talking about Taoran Literature Network?

511
00:35:31,739 --> 00:35:34,140
I didn't expect you to be so mean.

512
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,879
You have been vindictive for so many years.

513
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,620
[New message from Chen Xuan Xuan]

514
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:44,779
Jian'an, President Du wants to see you when you have the time.

515
00:35:44,779 --> 00:35:48,319
Du... President Du.

516
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:50,319
Not surnamed Lu?

517
00:35:53,739 --> 00:35:56,479
I just happened to visit him.

518
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,439
Then why are you so anxious to get married?

519
00:36:00,439 --> 00:36:02,898
Is it because of Aunt Tang?

520
00:36:02,898 --> 00:36:05,799
I actually have conditions to marry you.

521
00:36:05,799 --> 00:36:09,420
I knew it. Aunt Tang said you run an investment company.

522
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:12,320
The situation is not good. You are short of money, right?

523
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:15,559
Or do you want my dad's business? I can tell you, stop dreaming.

524
00:36:15,559 --> 00:36:18,899
Okay. Forget what I said.

525
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,119
Don't go.

526
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,080
Do you really want to help me?

527
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,938
Well, we will get the marriage certificate in a low-key way.

528
00:36:25,938 --> 00:36:28,100
Let's make an agreement, okay?

529
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,059
Okay.

530
00:36:32,479 --> 00:36:34,820
I have drawn up the agreement. Check it out.

531
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,710
If there is no problem, sign it.

532
00:36:41,439 --> 00:36:44,380
"The contract period is one year"?

533
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:47,718
Right, we will divorce in one year.

534
00:36:47,718 --> 00:36:51,439
Marriage is not child's play. We should be cautious.

535
00:36:51,439 --> 00:36:54,440
Who knows what will happen after a year?

536
00:36:54,440 --> 00:36:57,838
"No physical contact during the contract."

537
00:36:57,838 --> 00:37:01,580
"Can't expose or interfere with each other's life."

538
00:37:02,519 --> 00:37:04,719
It is great if you can do it.

539
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:08,018
"Can't expose each other's relationships."

540
00:37:08,018 --> 00:37:10,279
We are low-key.

541
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:12,579
But from the moment we got the marriage certificate,

542
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:15,498
we are legally a couple, right?

543
00:37:19,219 --> 00:37:21,679
I have no problem,

544
00:37:22,239 --> 00:37:25,119
but there is one more thing.

545
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,098
During the contract period, don't hook up (casual physical encounter) with others.

546
00:37:30,098 --> 00:37:33,159
It is great if you can do that.

547
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:40,390
- By the way, don't be late for the wedding tomorrow.
- Oh?

548
00:38:04,259 --> 00:38:07,260
So am I married?

549
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,979
- Miss, pay the money.
- Oh my!

550
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:48,199
Sorry, sorry.

551
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,860
Sorry.

552
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,239
My daughter's mother-in-law, you said that fate's timing is perfect. This must be just right.

553
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,960
Yes, just like Jian'an and Bo Yan. These two children,

554
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,998
I think they were a match made in heaven and earth.

555
00:39:08,998 --> 00:39:12,579
Yes. Finally, my wish comes true.

556
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:16,020
- Hurry.
- Okay.

557
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,899
President Lu, confidentiality agreements for all hotel staff and the emcee are signed.

558
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,158
Remember to tell the emcee to cooperate with me during the wedding.

559
00:39:22,158 --> 00:39:23,759
Okay.

560
00:39:24,419 --> 00:39:26,759
Xiao Xi, where is my veil?

561
00:39:26,759 --> 00:39:29,199
It is a marriage. Why bother with a veil?

562
00:39:29,199 --> 00:39:31,220
Hurry, hurry.

563
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:01,398
Yes, you can see that they are very affectionate.

564
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:06,680
Bridegroom, you may now kiss your bride.

565
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,738
Lu Bo Yan, how dare you?

566
00:40:20,738 --> 00:40:23,459
It is all for the pretense.

567
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:41,819
My daughter. If I don't force her, she won't listen to me.

568
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:44,199
If they didn't want it to be simple,

569
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:47,659
I would give them a grand wedding.

570
00:40:47,659 --> 00:40:49,840
You think too much.

571
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:56,919
Great.

572
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:11,360
Who could have ever known this was how my absurd marriage would begin?
