[Episode 19]

13
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,719
President Kang, you clearly knew Miss Su was President Lu's wife,

14
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:13,039
yet you ran lines with her late at night, causing this controversy!

15
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,598
Did you not think about avoiding suspicion?

16
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:19,040
President Lu, Miss Su joined President Kang's crew and ran lines with him so late at night.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,279
- Geez. This is going to get out of hand.
- What do you think of it?

18
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,340
Which company do you work for?

19
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:28,200
Well, let me reveal the truth.

20
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:31,800
- What?
- The truth?

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:44,299
Actually, they have cherished each other as commercial competitors, and they are also like brothers in private.

22
00:01:44,299 --> 00:01:47,958
It is not as complicated as you think. Am I right, Bo Yan?

23
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:51,119
President Kang, you should tell them the truth.

24
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,579
Oh, yes, yes. Despite our competition all these years, we are close friends now.

25
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,424
We appreciate each other.

26
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:01,980
We didn't tell the public for the sake of our companies.

27
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:05,850
In fact, we often get together in private.

28
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,158
Yes, that's true.

29
00:02:12,158 --> 00:02:13,859
And...

30
00:02:13,859 --> 00:02:16,938
I didn't think you were as close as brothers!

31
00:02:16,938 --> 00:02:19,318
Isn't this the first time you have shown up together?

32
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:22,739
Could you two get closer? We would like to take a photo of you two.

33
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:25,139
- All right, come on.
- Let's go.

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,900
Come on, shake hands.

35
00:02:31,039 --> 00:02:33,519
Come closer.

[Lu Bo Yan and Kang Rui Cheng are in tune for the first time.]

37
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,460
Unbelievable!

38
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,880
They look so great!

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
Why did you do this?

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,658
For your sake. You love Su Jian'an so much.

41
00:03:27,658 --> 00:03:31,019
It was a good opportunity, but you didn't make the most of it.

42
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:33,680
You even helped them explain everything!

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,660
Love isn't about possession.

44
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:41,239
Love is about wishing the best for her. You don't understand.

45
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,220
You are so stupid.

46
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,698
Miss Su said she would give you another chance.

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,920
Give me another chance?

48
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,120
I left Lu's Media,

49
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,370
and turned against Lu Bo Yan all because of Su Jian'an!

50
00:03:56,379 --> 00:03:59,800
Are you telling me she is giving me another chance?

51
00:04:02,379 --> 00:04:05,179
President Kang, when we signed the contract,

52
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:08,674
you promised that you would help me.

53
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:09,999
What is wrong now?

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,338
Do you want to break your promise for the sake... of love?

55
00:04:14,338 --> 00:04:17,225
Yes, I promised you

56
00:04:17,225 --> 00:04:19,749
that those who ignored you would look at you

57
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,819
with new eyes only after you get better.

58
00:04:21,819 --> 00:04:24,298
But not with such despicable methods!

59
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:27,360
People will tire of you if you do this.

60
00:04:28,399 --> 00:04:31,320
Miss Han, I hope you can correct your mistakes.

61
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,107
Or else, my Ruijin Group won't have a place for people of bad character like you.

62
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:41,339
Think about it.

63
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,619
I didn't expect President Lu to be so generous.

64
00:05:02,619 --> 00:05:05,580
It is so awesome!

65
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,718
There are no cancellations now,

66
00:05:08,718 --> 00:05:12,920
but the readers lack the enthusiasm to re-order!

67
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,950
If it weren't for this accident,

68
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:18,600
the pre-orders would have surpassed 100,000 by now!

69
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,090
Never mind the rules.

70
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,630
I will tell them to publish the novel now!

71
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,639
What is lacking or not doesn't matter.

72
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,259
President, I support you!

73
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:32,879
President, I don't think you should change the rules for my sake.

74
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:35,138
I have confidence in my novel.

75
00:05:35,138 --> 00:05:38,099
Jian'an, I support you!

76
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:03,878
President Lu, the scandal was so devastating that it destroyed readers' enthusiasm.

77
00:06:03,878 --> 00:06:05,678
I have tried every way I could think of,

78
00:06:05,678 --> 00:06:08,499
but I'm afraid it will be hard for the pre-orders to increase.

79
00:06:08,499 --> 00:06:10,899
President Du also talked with Sister-in-law,

80
00:06:10,899 --> 00:06:14,125
but Sister-in-law didn't allow him to change the publication rules.

81
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,519
If it doesn't reach 100,000 and her novel can't be published,

82
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:20,299
it will be devastating to Jian'an.

83
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,700
I want to hold a live broadcast with Jian'an.

84
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,759
We need to arouse the enthusiasm of the fans.

85
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,459
Are you sure, President Lu?

86
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:36,819
It won't be as simple as you think it will be.

87
00:06:36,819 --> 00:06:39,319
Anything is possible.

88
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:48,380
President Lu is so cool!

89
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,810
President Lu is very handsome.

90
00:06:49,818 --> 00:06:51,318
But I think President Lu looks really nervous.

91
00:06:51,318 --> 00:06:52,799
President Lu looks so serious.

92
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,099
- Look.
- President Lu, smile!

93
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:57,598
- He's cute!
- Show us your affinity (harmony)!

94
00:06:57,598 --> 00:06:59,320
Yes!

95
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,300
My mother is coming!

96
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,638

Pay attention to the reservation button at the bottom of the screen,

99
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:17,518
because from now on,

100
00:07:17,519 --> 00:07:19,518
every time we receive another 10,000 pre-orders,

101
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:24,850
Su Jian'an and I will recreate a sweet scene from the novel.

102
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,260
Okay. Let's begin now.

103
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,778
Awesome.

104
00:07:29,778 --> 00:07:33,700
President Lu really has created an advertisement.

105
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,318
Watch carefully.

106
00:07:35,319 --> 00:07:37,700
All right, Boss. All right.

107
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,660
Now, I will take you to see how Little Monster sleeps.

108
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,120
Voila!

109
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,978
I usually have to squeeze to fit in the corner when we sleep.

110
00:07:52,978 --> 00:07:54,699
I am so pitiable.

111
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:57,199
I have no place to sleep at all.

112
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,038
The first bonus is the morning kiss from the novel.

113
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,839
We still need 9,000 more pre-orders to reach the first target.

114
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:20,159
Once we meet the goal, I will wake her up with a kiss.

Hurry now!

116
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,800

We've received the next 10,000 pre-orders!

120
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:36,958
Awesome!

121
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,174
It is increasing!

122
00:08:39,174 --> 00:08:41,539
We will surpass 100,000 pre-orders easily!

123
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,720
- Great!
- Come on!

Are you crazy? Who are you live-streaming with?

132
00:09:18,178 --> 00:09:20,319
I don't believe you.

- Hey!
- I will kill you!

- Yes, really.

It is the first physical book I've written.

Don't worry. You will have more books in the future.

Of course, it is my job.

If the book goes on selling like this,

216

I don't think the current inventory will be enough.

324
00:21:58,158 --> 00:22:00,739
I will be there right away!

Say it.

327
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:12,179
What is your relationship with Xiao Xi?

328
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,659
To tell you the truth, Uncle...

329
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:20,859
I'm Luo Xiao Xi's boyfriend.

330
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:23,160
My name is Jiang Shao Kai.

331
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,799
Jiang Shao Kai.

332
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,719
I know you.

333
00:22:28,719 --> 00:22:31,120
- People call you "Brother Kai."
- Yes.

334
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:35,600
You pick up girls at bars.

335
00:22:37,819 --> 00:22:40,860
Uncle! That's all in the past.

336
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,640
After I started dating Xiao Xi,

337
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,070
I cut off contact with those friends.

338
00:22:45,078 --> 00:22:47,079
Didn't I, Xiao Xi?

339
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,475
That evening, why didn't you tell me you were dating her?

340
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:01,560
That evening... that evening...

341
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,339
That evening, you caught me by surprise.

342
00:23:04,339 --> 00:23:08,038
I didn't know you were Xiao Xi's father, and I was not well-dressed.

343
00:23:08,038 --> 00:23:09,800
I...

344
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,999
I didn't want to leave you with a bad impression of me

345
00:23:12,999 --> 00:23:14,999
so I told you I was her roommate.

346
00:23:14,999 --> 00:23:18,339
I didn't tell you the truth. I should be punished!

347
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:21,139
I... I will drink a cup for it.

348
00:23:30,219 --> 00:23:32,739
You know the drill.

349
00:23:32,739 --> 00:23:37,218
Of course, I do! We are meeting officially today.

350
00:23:37,218 --> 00:23:41,198
You are the senior. I will serve you.

351
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,739
Dad. He admitted it.

352
00:23:52,739 --> 00:23:55,579
- I think this is enough.
- It's not enough.

353
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:58,039
Correct! It is not enough.

354
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:01,000
Uncle has come all this way.

355
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,258
I should drink more. I will toast to you.

356
00:24:05,258 --> 00:24:08,318
Stop it, both of you! Jiang Shao Kai, stop this!

357
00:24:08,318 --> 00:24:10,080
Let him drink.

358
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:13,819
Today I will test this guy.

359
00:24:13,819 --> 00:24:16,519
I want to know if he is qualified to be my son-in-law.

360
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:19,539
Yes, Uncle is right.

361
00:24:19,539 --> 00:24:23,180
Uncle, let's get drunk tonight.

362
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:26,318
Come on. Let's toast to you.

363
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,519
Uncle, you are a good drinker.

364
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,118
And you have a beautiful daughter, Luo Xiao Xi.

365
00:24:42,118 --> 00:24:44,359
You should take all the credit.

366
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:49,899
Not just me, her mom gets some credit, too.

367
00:24:49,899 --> 00:24:52,118
Uncle, you are so modest.

368
00:24:52,118 --> 00:24:54,078
See, Luo Xiao Xi is so beautiful.

369
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:57,860
Just like you! You're so handsome!

370

You're absolutely right!

371
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:01,460
Back then, I was

372
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:05,040
the most beautiful man in our village.

Xiao Xi.

374
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:14,525
Tomorrow, your cousin, Luo Xiao Yu, will come visit Taoran.

375
00:25:14,525 --> 00:25:16,319
You should take good care of her.

376
00:25:16,319 --> 00:25:19,939
Since when do I have a cousin?

377
00:25:20,939 --> 00:25:22,398
Okay, okay.

378
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:25,779
No problem, leave it to me!

Oh my goodness! Holy cow!

Jiang Shao Kai! What are you shouting early in the morning?

385
00:26:09,779 --> 00:26:12,558
Xiao Xi, listen to my explanation! I drank too much last night. I don't know her—

386
00:26:12,558 --> 00:26:15,800
Serves you right. Who told you to get so drunk last night?

387
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,858
This is my cousin, Luo Xiao Yu. We mentioned her last night.

388
00:26:18,858 --> 00:26:20,976
Just graduated from university, she's come to visit Taoran.

389
00:26:20,976 --> 00:26:22,359
Show her around.

390
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:25,399
Hello. Brother Shao Kai, how are you doing?

391
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:27,638
Later, I need to go out with my father.

392
00:26:27,638 --> 00:26:30,158
Your task today is to take care of my cousin.

393
00:26:30,158 --> 00:26:32,378
- And you need to clean the house, by the way.
- I...

394
00:26:32,378 --> 00:26:34,240
- Goodbye!
- Okay, goodbye, Cousin!

- Bye bye!
- Bye bye!

- Enjoy your day!
- Okay.

Luo Xiao Xi!

398

Brother Shao Kai, this is honey water.

399
00:26:41,859 --> 00:26:44,259
You will feel better if you drink it.

400
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:48,919
Thank you.

401
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,939
Where do you want to play today?

402
00:26:54,939 --> 00:26:58,616
Today... today... I want to play the crane game!

403
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:01,678
- Crane game?
- Yes!

405
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:16,238
Wow, Brother Shao Kai! It is so cute!

406
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:19,219
You are so great! You are the best man I have ever met!

407
00:27:19,219 --> 00:27:23,099
Of course, I'm a master at the crane game. We will play the crane game again next time.

408
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:26,859
Yes, you are my Superman! Let's play it again next time.

- Let's go home!
- Let's go!

410
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:35,159
I haven't played the crane game for so many years, yet I still won so many dolls!

411
00:27:35,159 --> 00:27:38,020
I'm amazing!

This is for Xiao Xi!

00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,219
- Brother Shao Kai, drink some water.
- Thank you.

414
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,599
Just put it there. I will handle it later.

Brother Shao Kai, you've been shopping with me all day.

Just leave the housework to me.

You got me so many dolls too!

All right.

00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,318
- How was today?
- Great!

- Xiao Yu, you should rest a little. Don't wash that.
- It is all right.

424
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:33,618
You don't need to wash that!

425
00:28:33,618 --> 00:28:36,738
I have already washed it. Anyway, it was no trouble.

Brother Shao Kai, you hang clothes out with Sister Xiao Xi like this, don't you?

429
00:28:45,399 --> 00:28:49,959
She is pampered. I'm thankful as long as she doesn't give me orders.

430
00:28:49,959 --> 00:28:54,439
Why would a great man like Brother Shao Kai choose someone like Sister Xiao Xi?

431
00:28:54,439 --> 00:28:57,238
I know her. She has a bad temper and loves bars.

432
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:59,299
She has many male friends.

433
00:28:59,299 --> 00:29:04,079
She always bullied me when we were children because of her family status.

434
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:07,439
Our love is built on quarrels,

435

I spoke evil things about your daughter in front of him.

440
00:29:36,819 --> 00:29:38,899
However, he thinks they are all qualities in her.

441
00:29:38,899 --> 00:29:42,960
From my assessment, he loves your daughter for real.

Got it. You may take your money now.

He is not tempted by other women.

448

but I don't know why he took it so seriously.

485
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:17,560
Child marriage? That's an arranged marriage from old traditions.

486
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,390
Do you really want to marry him?

487
00:32:19,390 --> 00:32:21,730
Impossible!

488
00:32:22,519 --> 00:32:25,239
I love only you!

489
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:29,179
But his family is established and powerful in Yong'an.

490
00:32:29,179 --> 00:32:31,318
My father has to show respect to them.

491
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:34,800
We need their consent first if I don't marry him.

492
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:39,419
Xiao Xi. Happiness is in our own hands.

493
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:43,240
We can't bow to the feudal forces of Yong'an, can we?

494
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,960
Okay. I will go to see Jian'an and President Lu now.

495
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:49,758
I need to know more about him. You should talk about this with your father.

496
00:32:49,758 --> 00:32:51,719
- Okay.
- Let's split up for now.

497
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,499
We can do this.

498
00:32:57,599 --> 00:33:00,118
The Qin Family is a powerful family in Yong'an.

499
00:33:00,118 --> 00:33:01,679
They have no business relationships with me.

500
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,039
If you want, I can inquire about them.

501
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:08,050
So is their marriage contract effective or not?

502
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,239
It has no legal effect.

503
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:14,050
I think it depends on Luo Xiao Xi's father's attitude toward you.

504
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:16,420
The Luo and Qin families have been friends for generations.

505
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:18,919
They might want to strengthen their friendship.

506
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,640
Shao Kai, I think you need to get the support of Xiao Xi's father.

507
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,359
He should see you as his son-in-law.

508
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:29,080
Okay.

509
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,600
Shao Kai, I want to take Xiao Xi back to our hometown.

510
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,120
She will marry Qin Wei.

511
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:51,560
Uncle, I think this is not right.

512
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:53,460
This is about Xiao Xi's lifelong happiness.

513
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:57,475
How can you force her to marry a man she doesn't love?

514
00:33:57,475 --> 00:34:00,299
What do you mean?

515
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:02,859
Xiao Xi and I have been together for so long.

516
00:34:02,859 --> 00:34:05,479
We have argued from time to time,

517
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:07,738
but we've never thought about leaving each other.

518
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:10,700
Because we really love each other!

519
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:13,519
My family is not as rich as yours,

520
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:17,458
but I promise to give Xiao Xi happiness all her life.

521
00:34:17,458 --> 00:34:20,020
It's more important than anything!

522
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,959
If you really care about Xiao Xi,

523
00:34:23,539 --> 00:34:26,299
you can't ignore her wishes.

524
00:34:26,299 --> 00:34:27,820
Xiao Xi.

525
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:31,120
Kai Kai.

526
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:35,879
All right.

527
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,320
For my daughter's happiness,

528
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:46,019
I will do anything.

529
00:34:46,019 --> 00:34:49,440
I will talk with the Qin family.

530
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:53,700
- I hope they won't go crazy.
- What?

531
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:15,890
♫ Taking off the grownup coat ♫

532
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:18,300
♫ I just want to find you to rely on ♫

533
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:23,030
♫ Lend me your smile, the one that looks like a child's ♫

534
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:24,220
♫ Yes ♫

535
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,930
♫ There's nothing I can't do for you ♫

536
00:35:26,930 --> 00:35:31,110
♫ No matter how far I am, as long as you need me ♫

537
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:34,700
♫ I'll be there in the next second ♫

538
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,440
♫ The first draft of your script ♫

539
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,130
♫ Is my tender trap ♫

540
00:35:41,130 --> 00:35:43,880
♫ What should I do in order for you to receive ♫

541
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,610
♫ The signal from my fluttering heart? ♫

542
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:49,380
♫ I don't understand your pride ♫

543
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:53,060
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

544
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:56,190
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

545
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:01,960
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

546
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:05,660
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

547
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:08,440
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

548
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,180
♫ Warning all problems ♫

549
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,910
♫ To stay away from us ♫

550
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:16,550
♫ No one can take my place ♫

551
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:20,310
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

552
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:23,400
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

553
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,590
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
