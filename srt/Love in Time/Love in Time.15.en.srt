- Do you think it's okay if I revise it like this?
- It's okay.

14
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:14,455
Director, President Kang, both of you are here.

15
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:15,519
Is there a problem?

16
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:18,198
Miss Su, please take a seat.

17
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:30,075
We have a problem with the capital chain (finances) for the project.

18
00:01:30,075 --> 00:01:32,460
I can't fill in the gaps in a short amount of time.

19
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,039
Everyone has contributed a lot of effort into making this film.

20
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:39,275
So I want to make some small adjustments to the script.

21
00:01:39,275 --> 00:01:42,100
Miss Su, only you know the script best.

22
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:45,500
If we can remove the most costly scenes

23
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:48,660
without sacrificing the important elements,

24
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,300
I can control the costs for the filming.

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:55,300
I haven't done this before though.

26
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:56,780
I don't know if I can do it well.

27
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:57,900
Don't worry about that.

28
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:00,640
If something goes wrong, I alone will take responsibility for it.

29
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,859
Director Guo and I will also cooperate with you.

30
00:02:14,025 --> 00:02:18,120
Since you all believe in me, I will try.

31
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:20,719
- Great!
- Then

32
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:23,950
I will cooperate with Miss Su and Director Guo for the script revision.

33
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:27,200
Each of you should also prepare for your own duties.

34
00:02:58,460 --> 00:03:00,660
Miss Han, did you wish to see us?

35
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,050
You're here!

Please take a seat.

Sorry for disturbing you guys.

38
00:03:07,859 --> 00:03:11,920
- I want to confirm the emotional changes of this scene with you.
- Okay.

39
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,574
The supporting role, Yu Tong, has a secret crush on the male lead, Ling Feng.

40
00:03:14,574 --> 00:03:17,700
She knows the female lead and male lead love each other,

41
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,826
but she still wants to confess her love to the main lead.

42
00:03:19,826 --> 00:03:22,080
However, the female lead overhears the last part of her confession,

43
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,179
making her feel shocked and betrayed.

44
00:03:25,179 --> 00:03:30,750
I still haven't grasped the psychological state of the female lead.

45
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,659
Well, I will explain it to Miss Han.

46
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:35,939
How about this? I think we should rehearse the script now.

166
00:10:13,919 --> 00:10:16,600
We will break up when our contract expires!

167
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:08,839
I'm sorry, President Kang. I dragged you into this.

168
00:11:08,839 --> 00:11:10,819
You don't need to blame yourself.

169
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,260
I'm sorry that I didn't make things clear.

170
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,920
Are you okay?

171
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,049
It's just a small injury. I'm fine.

172
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:21,260
I am sorry for what happened today.

173
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,020
I should be the one to apologize.

174
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:26,299
If necessary, I can explain to President Lu.

175
00:11:26,299 --> 00:11:28,499
There's no need, President Kang.

176
00:11:28,499 --> 00:11:30,900
I would like to go back to rest now.

177
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:54,275
Do you know the legend of the Ferris wheel?

178
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:56,959
Lovers can't ride the Ferris wheel

179
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:58,620
or they will break up.

180
00:11:58,620 --> 00:11:59,720
Liar!

181
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,220
It's true!

182
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,660
But if they kiss when the Ferris wheel reaches its highest point,

183
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:07,060
they won't ever be separated.

184
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:17,540
Beautiful Lady, may I have this dance?

185
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,039
I might step on your feet.

186
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,980
Step on my feet.

187
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:32,560
Just follow my lead now. Okay?

188
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,260
♫ My failure is only because I know how to run away impulsively  ♫

189
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:50,480
Bo Yan... what do you want?

190
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,630
♫ My regret is accidentally losing the color  ♫

191
00:12:55,630 --> 00:13:02,910
♫ Of the love you gave me  ♫

192
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:08,720
♫  Will I get used to not having you by my side?  ♫

193
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,870
♫ What should I do in order to reverse the situation, staging a non-separation?  ♫

194
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:19,030
♫ Because you've long become a dependence in my life ♫

195
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:24,390
♫ The most difficult to give up ♫

196
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:28,110
♫ I've been deeply loved ♫

197
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:33,050
♫ For a decade ♫

198
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,460
Come in.

199
00:14:07,539 --> 00:14:10,258
President Lu, you didn't come home yesterday.

200
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:13,020
I've brought your breakfast and stomach medicine.

201
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:15,579
Just leave it here. Thank you.

202
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:17,800
President Lu, here. Drink your medicine first.

203
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,639
It's still hot.

204
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:20,900
Drink it while it's hot.

205
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:23,080
I will drink it if you do.

206
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,940
I don't want it.

207
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:36,000
President Lu, before Mrs. Lu left, she specifically told me

208
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,299
that I must make sure you take your medicine on time.

209
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:40,199
I said I don't want it!

210
00:14:46,059 --> 00:14:47,859
Take it away.

211
00:14:51,699 --> 00:14:54,280
Remember to eat.

212
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,300
I'll head back now.

213
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,880
I'm sorry that I'm late.

214
00:15:52,779 --> 00:15:54,279
Miss Su,

215
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:56,479
you didn't rest well last night, did you?

216
00:15:56,479 --> 00:15:59,259
Why don't you just go back and rest today?

217
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:03,100
I'm fine. Don't worry.

218
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,440
I won't let my work get affected.

219
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,825
You are clearly not well right now.

220
00:16:07,825 --> 00:16:10,059
I will tell Jing Jing and Xiao Min to revise the script these next few days.

221
00:16:10,059 --> 00:16:11,759
Don't worry.

222
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,539
All right then.

223
00:16:15,539 --> 00:16:17,579
Thank you, President Kang.

224
00:16:37,571 --> 00:16:39,550
Miss Han, you wanted to see me?

225
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,279
Sit down.

226
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,320
Song Yu, how many years have you been working for President Kang?

227
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,179
How does President Kang treat you?

228
00:16:51,179 --> 00:16:53,819
Ever since the establishment of Ruijin Group,

229
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:56,419
President Kang has helped me during my most difficult times.

230
00:16:56,419 --> 00:16:58,319
He is my savior.

231
00:16:58,819 --> 00:17:01,560
- He's my savior, too.
- Thank you, Miss Han.

232
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:03,400
I...

233
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,319
After I left Lu's Media, President Kang reached out to me

234
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:09,940
when I needed help the most.

235
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:17,375
Don't you think President Kang has been a bit strange recently?

236
00:17:17,375 --> 00:17:21,080
His mood used to be sometimes good, sometimes bad...

237
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:23,098
I haven't seen him like this for many years.

238
00:17:23,098 --> 00:17:26,199
However, he has been much happier recently.

239
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:30,239
Is there a girl that President Kang is in love with?

240
00:17:30,239 --> 00:17:33,040
I often see him with a picture album in his hands.

241
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,600
Yes.

242
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,540
There is a girl whom he likes.

243
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,074
But I think they haven't seen each other for many years.

244
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:42,700
President Kang rarely talks to me about things like this.

245
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,100
President Kang is a good businessman,

246
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:50,340
but he is a bit of a coward when it comes to love.

247
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,459
Do you know why President Kang's condition has changed?

248
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,059
Why?

249
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,840
Because he met that girl.

250
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,119
Let me tell you the truth. It's Su Jian'an!

251
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,100
She was forced to marry Lu Bo Yan.

252
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:08,260
She was forced. She is very unhappy.

253
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,499
President Kang found out about this, but he's also afraid to express his feelings.

254
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,680
So all he can do is take care of her silently in the crew.

255
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:17,040
After Lu Bo Yan found out about this, he hit President Kang!

256
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:20,700
But President Kang remained silent for the sake of Su Jian'an.

257
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,419
What! Lu Bo Yan hit President Kang?

258
00:18:23,419 --> 00:18:25,720
Don't get worked up!

259
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,320
Calm down.

260
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:30,580
President Kang has always been good to me

261
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,575
and you are closest with President Kang.

262
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:36,700
So I called you here to discuss how to help President Kang.

263
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:41,200
We need to help him get his beloved woman back from Lu Bo Yan.

264
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,739
I can consider helping with whatever is good for President Kang.

265
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:47,259
That's the spirit!

266
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,860
I especially bought this for you from the shop at the intersection.

267
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:52,359
They're all your favorites.

268
00:18:52,359 --> 00:18:54,399
Come on, try it.

269
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,539
Good girl.

270
00:18:58,939 --> 00:19:02,440
Jian'an, you can't starve yourself all day like this.

271
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,879
Yes, Jian'an. You should eat a bit.

272
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:09,399
I really have no appetite.

273
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,200
Go busy yourselves. I want to be alone.

274
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,640
Su Jian'an! You must have a bite today!

275
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,180
- Come on, open your mouth!
- Hey.

276
00:19:20,219 --> 00:19:21,719
It's useless.

277
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,639
I will leave the food here.

278
00:19:29,639 --> 00:19:33,020
You have to eat it later. Don't forget!

279
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,319
Why are you sighing?

280
00:19:51,319 --> 00:19:53,719
Think of a solution for Jian'an.

281
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,419
As the saying goes,

282
00:19:58,419 --> 00:20:02,820
the best way to forget your old love is to start a new love.

283
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,119
Do you think everyone is like you?

284
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,279
I'm sure President Lu is also having a hard time now.

285
00:20:30,775 --> 00:20:33,839
You play with that fat girl who sells lingerie, Su Jian'an, all day!

286
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:36,820
Do you really want to be her friend?

287
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,700
No one wants to be friends with a fat girl.

288
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,240
So Lu Bo Yan has been playing her all this time!

289
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:47,010
Of course! Who would want to be friends with a fat girl whose family sells lingerie?

290
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,900
Lu Bo Yan, what are you doing?

291
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,580
Your voice has been broadcast all over the school!

292
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,659
Su Jian'an!

293
00:20:54,659 --> 00:20:56,879
I have something to tell you.

294
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:03,620
Lu Bo Yan, you big liar!

295
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:05,580
I will never believe you again!

296
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,039
Never!

297
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,699
Lu Bo Yan, I thought you had changed!

298
00:21:21,699 --> 00:21:23,540
But you haven't changed at all!

299
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,060
You are still a self-righteous liar!

300
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,960
[Shen Yue Chuan]

301
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,240
- Hello.
- President Lu,

302
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,179
don't sleep at the company today. You should go home.

303
00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:01,679
It's okay. By the way,

304
00:22:02,259 --> 00:22:03,820
how are your preparations for tomorrow's meeting going?

305
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:05,750
Everything is ready. Don't worry.

306
00:22:05,750 --> 00:22:08,879
Why don't I stay with you tonight?

307
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,679
There's no need.

308
00:22:24,975 --> 00:22:27,540
This product placement will affect

309
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:30,319
a significant moment explaining the protagonist's emotions.

310
00:22:30,319 --> 00:22:32,519
It won't be as good as before.

311
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,459
Let me think some more about it.

312
00:22:35,459 --> 00:22:38,618
All right, President Kang. We will go back and revise the script.

313
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:50,240
- Come in!
- President Kang, they have stopped filming for the day.

314
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,699
The shooting has been going well recently.

315
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:55,200
How has Miss Su been these last two days?

316
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,520
According to Luo Xiao Xi,

317
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,400
she has locked herself in her room.

318
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,739
She doesn't go out and only eats a little.

319
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,200
President Kang, why are you here?

320
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,680
I heard you haven't gone to the set recently.

321
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,399
You stay in this small room every day.

322
00:23:41,399 --> 00:23:43,940
You can't do this to yourself.

323
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,300
Thank you, but I'm fine.

324
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,459
You are a good scriptwriter but a bad liar.

325
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:54,075
I brought you some food.

326
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,259
Thank you.

327
00:23:58,350 --> 00:24:00,350
Please come in.

328
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,200
How is your injury?

329
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:19,222
After meeting you, I find that I've been getting injured a lot.

330
00:24:22,319 --> 00:24:23,675
I'm just kidding.

331
00:24:23,675 --> 00:24:26,650
In the future, don't worry about little things like this.

332
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,899
You should take care of yourself more.

333
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,179
I am really sorry for delaying the work.

334
00:24:34,179 --> 00:24:35,680
Don't apologize to me.

335
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,680
You should apologize to yourself.

336
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,480
When I first founded Ruijin Group,

337
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,159
I met a girl.

338
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,359
Her magical-like appearance helped me.

339
00:24:47,359 --> 00:24:49,220
Then she suddenly disappeared.

340
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:51,200
I looked for her for a long time, but it was in vain.

341
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,919
Then I thought, "I can't do this."

342
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,125
"I must get back on the track of life and work“

343
00:24:57,125 --> 00:25:03,075
"so I can be at my best when I see her again."

344
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:05,720
Taste my cooking.

345
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,420
Thank you.

346
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,950
Did you find that girl?

347
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,159
It looks like your focus is still on emotions right now.

348
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,100
What are you trying to say?

349
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:23,425
Look. You're locking yourself up in this small room.

350
00:25:23,425 --> 00:25:26,825
You shut yourself away from people and what you like.

351
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:29,400
Not only will this not change anything,

352
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,375
but you'll just make yourself suffer even more.

353
00:25:32,375 --> 00:25:35,359
Since those things have already happened, you might as well change your attitude.

354
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,360
You should devote yourself to something else

355
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,825
so your attention will be diverted.

356
00:25:39,825 --> 00:25:42,800
After a while, when you feel better,

357
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,298
all the sad things may be fixed.

358
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:48,319
Really?

359
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:50,699
You won't know until you try.

360
00:25:50,699 --> 00:25:52,320
Drink your soup first.

361
00:26:00,599 --> 00:26:02,299
How is it?

362
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,119
It's delicious! It's better than what I make.

363
00:26:06,119 --> 00:26:09,399
Food and work can soothe your pain.

364
00:26:09,399 --> 00:26:11,299
Drink some more!

365
00:26:19,599 --> 00:26:21,299
Drink more.

366
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,560
Are you lying to me again? I won't go!

367
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:08,138
Remember, you are my wife.

368
00:27:18,599 --> 00:27:21,480
Sir, do you like it?

369
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,060
It's quite pretty!

370
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,460
Really? Let's take some pictures.

371
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:46,060
Jian'an! I've been looking for you for a long time!

372
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:48,540
You're sitting alone here! Why didn't you call us?

373
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,860
Exactly.

374
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,519
I just wanted to be alone.

375
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:55,399
Jiang Shao Kai, go buy me some water.

376
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:56,620
I am so thirsty.

377
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:57,920
I won't.

378
00:27:59,170 --> 00:28:00,459
Go.

379
00:28:00,459 --> 00:28:02,059
All right.

380
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,380
You miss him, don't you?

381
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,599
I don't know.

382
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:14,600
Stop denying it.

383
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,960
President Lu may be a little overbearing,

384
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,399
but he still has many good qualities.

385
00:28:19,399 --> 00:28:21,939
What good qualities does he have?

386
00:28:21,939 --> 00:28:23,575
He spoils his wife.

387
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:27,500
I think he spoils his wife the most in the world.

388
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:31,650
Sometimes, the love he gives you may be a little overboard,

389
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:35,260
but it shows how important you are to him.

390
00:28:35,725 --> 00:28:38,659
You know this, don't you?

391
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:43,425
Jian'an,

392
00:28:43,425 --> 00:28:47,219
the last several days you've locked yourself up.

393
00:28:47,219 --> 00:28:49,179
You numbed yourself with work,

394
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:51,480
trying to forget him.

395
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:54,000
The fact is, you can't.

396
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,599
And have you realized this?

397
00:28:55,599 --> 00:28:58,240
After you and Lu Bo Yan got married,

398
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,280
you no longer feel inferior when facing love.

399
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:02,600
You became brave!

400
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,319
Do you know why?

401
00:29:06,319 --> 00:29:07,359
Why?

402
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,319
Because you love him.

403
00:29:09,319 --> 00:29:12,280
You can't force yourself to lie when it comes to love.

404
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,720
You can have your career aspirations.

405
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,720
He can also love you in his own way.

406
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,319
You will live together for a lifetime

407
00:29:19,319 --> 00:29:21,960
so you need to communicate when you have an argument.

408
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,560
Isn't that right?

409
00:29:25,275 --> 00:29:30,379
But he won't fix his temper.

410
00:29:30,379 --> 00:29:32,440
It has been so many days already!

411
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,180
You should call him.

412
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:37,158
Listen to his voice and find out what he is thinking.

413
00:29:37,158 --> 00:29:40,925
Maybe he misses you a lot.

Hello?

Jian'an, don't forget we're going to check out the site tomorrow afternoon.

Yes, President Kang. I remember!

I'll see you tomorrow.

Please take a look. This chart shows the percentage of revenue from each of our group's subsidiaries.

430
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,919
Our physical sales revenue has increased by 42% over the last year.

431
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:28,650
The entertainment project revenues increased by 67%,

432
00:31:28,650 --> 00:31:32,619
and our financial gains are 50% higher than last year as well.

433
00:31:32,619 --> 00:31:34,279
According to the above data,

434
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:37,199
we have focused mainly on the entertainment industry

435
00:31:37,199 --> 00:31:39,638
because it has been the most profitable industry over the past few years.

436
00:31:39,638 --> 00:31:42,799
I hope all of you will look at this with great importance.

437
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:45,759
President Lu, do you have any more instructions?

438
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,719
President Lu.

439
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,660
I have no questions.

440
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,398
That's all for today.

441
00:32:02,398 --> 00:32:04,199
You are all dismissed.

442
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,559
Why did he leave just like that?

443
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:14,339
What happened?

444
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:16,540
I have no idea.

445
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,380
Let's end the meeting.

446
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,040
President Lu!

447
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,080
Say it.

448
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,119
This is so unlike you.

449
00:32:36,259 --> 00:32:38,659
This is between Jian'an and me.

450
00:32:38,659 --> 00:32:40,520
I will handle it myself.

451
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,120
How can you handle it in your current condition?

452
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,439
President Lu, you were so aloof before.

453
00:32:46,439 --> 00:32:50,799
You have become so gentle after you met Miss Su.

454
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:54,180
Even I can feel how much you love her.

455
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,525
But the way you love her is so arrogant!

456
00:33:03,525 --> 00:33:08,425
Everything you do for her is just what you imagine she needs.

457
00:33:10,879 --> 00:33:13,540
You are just afraid!

458
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:15,179
You are afraid of losing.

459
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:16,619
You're afraid of competition.

460
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:19,000
So you give her more than she needs.

461
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:24,020
President Lu, are you that insecure?

462
00:33:24,020 --> 00:33:28,860
Or do you feel so inferior in this relationship?

463
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:40,139
Everyone thinks you are a business genius.

464
00:33:40,139 --> 00:33:42,620
You have never failed in your investments!

465
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:46,925
But why are you such a coward when it comes to love?

466
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:48,819
Even if something is bothering you inside,

467
00:33:48,819 --> 00:33:50,720
why can't you say it out loud?

468
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,659
Why don't you have the guts to speak it out loud?

469
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:56,638
Even if you are wrong or even if you make a mistake, it doesn't matter!

470
00:33:56,638 --> 00:33:59,559
It proves how much you love her!

471
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:17,200
You are the victor when it comes to business.

472
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:22,580
But in love, you are a loser.

473
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,639
That's all I have to say.

474
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,179
President Lu, do whatever you want.

00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,470
♫ I just want to treat you well ♫

492
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,630
♫ Despite the occasional quarrels ♫

493
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:23,350
♫ The contract is still effective ♫

494
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:26,990
♫ The final draft of your script ♫

495
00:36:26,990 --> 00:36:29,770
♫ Is to grow old with me ♫

496
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:32,660
♫ Warning all problems ♫

497
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,420
♫ To stay away from us ♫

498
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,040
♫ No one can take my place ♫

499
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:41,760
♫ I want to keep treating you well ♫

500
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,900
♫ The nagging in my ear ♫

501
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:50,930
♫ Only you can make that noise ♫
