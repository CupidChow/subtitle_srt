do you think Zhu Mao

Maybe not if I kill Lin Bao'er,

112
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,920
but who I'll kill

113
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,360
is Xue Tong.

114
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,280
Right.

118
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,040
given that Zhu Mao is so ruthless,

119
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,800
do you think he'll let you survive?

120
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,640
You've been loyal to him over the years

121
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,560
and take on all the dirty work,

122
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:07,560
but in the end,
he enjoys the whole cake.

123

You just hurt his second wife
by mistake,

124
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,640

00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,920

except Zhu Mao?

132
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,000
He's not just trying to kill your son,

133
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,800
but the rest of your family as well.

you're just one of Zhu Mao's dogs.

138
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,360
I also want to approach Zhu Mao
