please have a seat.

189
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,240
Apologies.

190
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,360
This is a token of my esteem.

191
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,120
Have a seat.

192
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,040
Please have a seat.

193
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,280
Master Zhu, please.

194
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:38,480
You know, at the last wedding,

195
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,560
Yang Jian was out of his mind

196
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,440
and frightened you.

197
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,480
I know he's been working for you.

198
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,680
But from what I know of him,

199
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,560
he is a foolhardy man.

200
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:51,960
You're right.

201
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:52,720
Is it possible

202
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,040
there is someone behind him?

203
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:57,440
Maybe...

204
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,480
maybe I've pushed him too hard.

205
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,600
A cornered dog will bite.

206
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,440
So,

207
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,720
I've cleaned up the mess for you.

208
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:13,320
A dog that bites

209
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,200
doesn't deserve to be kept.

210
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,360
Master Zhu, you have great foresight
and determination!

211
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,560
I deeply admire you.

212
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,640
Besides,

213
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,960
I've instructed Wang Kang
to prepare the shipping approval

214
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,880
you mentioned last time.

215
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:35,680
Although

216
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,600
we failed to establish
a familial connection,

217
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,560
After all,

218
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,120
we're even more closely connected

219
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,240
than through marriage.
