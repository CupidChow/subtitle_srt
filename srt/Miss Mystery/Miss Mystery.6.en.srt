00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,760
Master, you guessed it.

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,560
Detective Yang visited
the shipping company with his staff.

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,800
Just as I expected.

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,760
But madam was at the company, too.

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,120
She was arrested by Detective Yang.

18
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,480

[Episode 6]

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,480
Opium smuggling is a capital crime.

21
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,960
Detective Yang,

22
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:12,360
It's been only a few days
since I took over the company,

23
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,720
and you just burst into
and placed opium on my desk.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,600
Now you want to accuse me of smuggling?

25
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,960
I placed it? Who saw that?

26
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,200
Did you see that?

27
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:22,960
No.

28
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,600
Did you see that?

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,240
No.

30
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,000
I'm sorry,

31
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,320
but no one saw that.

32
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,520
Fine, you just make it up.

33
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,840
I admire your candor.

I don't care how you killed Qian Tong.

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,120
But me,

Yang Jian,

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm not that foolish.

39
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,760
Detective Yang,
you want to investigate me?

40
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:54,720
Since you've put on such a big show,

41
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,520
if you're not to obtain any results,

42
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,400
won't you be ashamed of yourself?

43
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,920
Speak it out:

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,560
what's your purpose
for suddenly showing up in Lianhe Town?

45
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,040
My purpose?

46
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,200
I'm a businessperson.

47
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,880
All I pursue is profits.

48
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,280
This is not Southeast Asia.

49
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:11,800
If you want to run a business here,

50
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,440
you have to know who has the last word

51
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,200
in this place.

52
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,760
I don't think
you have the last word here.

53
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,680
It's not your place to make money,
either.

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,720
Then could you teach me how to do it?

55
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,360
Do you think you will make money
just by taking

56
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,520
over the shipping company?

57
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,880
Let me tell you.

58
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:42,840
The shipping company

59
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:46,000
is just part of the business
of the Zhu and the Dou families.

60
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,720
If you dare to go against us,

61
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,400
the Xue family's fate 18 years ago
may fall upon you, too.

62

You may be wiped out.

63
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,840
I can see you and Mr. Zhu Jr.

64
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,120
are just having a fling.

65
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,840
Do you think the family's business
will be passed down to you?

66
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,400
But

00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,880
if you join hands with me,

68
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,880
I promise you'll make a lot of money.

69
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,280
If I tell this to Master Zhu,

00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,280
what would he think?

71
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,840
You can try.

72
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,880
Master Zhu is very suspicious.

73
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,280
If I get killed,

74
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,360

Mr. Zhu Jr., what are you talking about?

80
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,760
Ms. Lin is just cooperating
with our investigation.

into our police station for a woman.

88
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,560

00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,480
I do intend to break into, so what?

00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,400
Are you sure you want to go against us?

Now you're in my hands.

92
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,400
I'm telling you,

00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,840
anyone who dares to touch Lin Bao'er

94
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,520

He almost killed us for her.
