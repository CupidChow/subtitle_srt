Mr. Dou!

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,120
I've long been looking forward
to meeting you.

23
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:19,720
You are the youngest
and most promising mayor of Lianhe Town!

We must write about you
in the county annals!

00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,080
Yes.

Thanks, Mr. Mayor.

29
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,840
Lianhe Town
has hundreds of years of history,

30
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,200
and in recent years, it has become
the largest town in the southeast region.

31
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,120
As town mayor,
you deserve much of the credit.

32
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,760
I was sent by the provincial newspaper

33
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,320

the folks here

43
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,840
were living in misery.

44
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,560
Do you remember Lianhe Town's
wealthy merchant, Master Zhu?

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:10,440
Yes, of course.

46
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,480

No.

51
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:36,160
Now you won't even call me father.

52
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,360
If you want me to call you father,

53
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,480
you should at least act like one.

54
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:42,320
How dare you!

55
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,040
It's bad enough
you usually act with impunity,

56
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,760
but now you've brought
all these reporters to make trouble.

57
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,800
Are you trying to ruin Lianhe Town

58

if I had a choice,

62
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,320

You're saying that again.

and moved into this house,
