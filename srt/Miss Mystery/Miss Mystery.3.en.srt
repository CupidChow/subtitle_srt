14
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,040
I didn't expect

15
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,480
that Qian Tong is having
an affair with the mayor's concubine.

Wait.

18
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,720
Ms. Lin, you can't get the money back
after paying. This is the rule.

19
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,320
I know the rules.

20
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,880
However, this time,
I don't need you to investigate

21
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,480

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,200

You can just send me orders, Mr. Zhu Jr.

You don't have to see me in person.

I heard the newly opened
Western restaurant has good food,

You were born in Southeast Asia,

49
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,360
so I'm not sure
if this small Western restaurant

50
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,440

The Lins have been rooted
in Southeast Asia for many years,

Chinese dietary habits.
