Jiacheng, I'm good.

18
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,960
You've been starving for so long.
You can have it.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,280
It's fine. Let's eat together.

20
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,600
When my family finds me,

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:31,920
stay with me

22
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:34,800

00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,360

[Episode 16]

25
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:12,000
Because I miss my sister,

26
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,760
I came unannounced.

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,080
Please don't mind my rudeness,
Master Zhu.

28
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,000
Of course not.

29
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,080
It's been a while since we last met
at Southeast Asian Chamber of Commerce.

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,600
I didn't expect our two families
to get married.

31
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,480
Since you've come all this way,
if you don't mind,

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,000
why not stay at my manor for a few days?

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,480
It would allow us
to be good hosts to you.

34
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,160
No need.

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,240
I have found a place to stay

36
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,960
and realized what kind of treatment
Bao'er is getting in the Zhu family.

37
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,880
I will take her with me in a few days.

38
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:37,080
We won't bother you anymore.

39
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,680
Not at all.

40
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:43,480
It is our Zhu family's good fortune
that Bao'er can marry Guanwen.

41
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,400
Today,

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,520

How about this?
Let's have dinner together tomorrow

so that we can catch up.

00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,360
Mr. Lin, what do you say?

46
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:59,800
I'm worried that Master Zhu
doesn't have much power in Lianhe Town,

47
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,240
or Bao'er would never
be bullied by outsiders.

48
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,400
Mr. Lin,

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,160
It was my fault for not disciplining
my daughter well, and she offended you.

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,600
Please forgive her, Mr. Lin.

Yes.

54
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,520
Did you call my brother here?

55
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,120
You already know?

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,320
He showed up so timely.
Who else could have done it?

59
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:49,000
Last time, with the shipment incident,
Dou Huaizhong took the upper hand.

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,880
How could he possibly
let you off easily?

61
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,120
I thought I could solve it by myself
and didn't want to bother my brother.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,640
He has already helped me a lot.

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,320
Dou Huaizhong treated you like this,

64
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:05,960
and I will never let them go.

65
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,600
Of course,

66
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,640
I didn't protect you well.

67
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
Since we have chosen to do this,

68
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
we have to face their rage.

69
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,760
Also,
we should act with caution recently.

70
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,560
Yes.

71
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:22,040
Right,

72
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,640
you didn't tell me that

73
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:27,320
Lin Jiacheng is so handsome.

74
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,440
I think I have seen

75
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,360
Lin Yaoshan's face in the newspaper.

76
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,880
He looks not so nice.

77
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
But why does his son
look so different from him?

78
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,000
Don't you know?

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,560
Lin Yaoshan married the prettiest woman
of Southeast Asia back then.

80
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,880
Also, you didn't tell me
how close you are to him.

81
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,680
Why? Are you jealous?

82
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,280
No.

83
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,120
Jiacheng grew up with me.

84
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,120
Whenever I did anything wrong,
he was always the one taking the blame.

85
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,320
If he had anything nice,
he would share it with me immediately.

86
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:00,960
Hmm.

87
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,320
Childhood sweetheart?

88
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,360
Jiacheng

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,520
is the second ray of light in my life.

90
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,440
If it wasn't for him,
I would have died in Southeast Asia.

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:14,640
He gave me all the love and care
I needed in the last 18 years.

92
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,120
But to me,

93
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,200
he is only the closest family.

94
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:22,120
The closest family.

95
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,560
Well,

96
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,040
how about me?

97
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,240
Father, do you need me for anything?

98
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:51,520
Bao'er,

99
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,720
have a seat.

100
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,680
How is it? Do you feel better?

101
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:00,000
Yes, much better.

102
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,120
Thank you for asking.

103
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,120
Dou Lili came to ours and made a fuss.

104
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,280
I'm sorry about that.

105
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
I should be blamed for
giving you so much responsibility

106
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,800
and overburdening you.

107
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,400
Father,

108
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,320
I came to Lianhe Town for not long.

109
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,520
If there are any inadequacies
in my handling of the business,

110
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,160
I will still need to rely on
your guidance and advice.

111
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,480
Not at all.

112
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,280
You younger people have more ideas,

113
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,920
so how can I teach you anything?

114
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,680
Also, handling the shipment company
can be exhausting,

115
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,840
and I think

116
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,800
you should

117
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,120
just hand it to others first.

118
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,880
Father,

119
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,960
the shipping company's business
has been booming these past two months.

120
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,680
If I hand it over to someone else now,

121
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,920
I'm afraid
it may lead to financial losses.

122
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,600
Your brother is in town.

123
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,600
You should spend some time with him.

124
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:54,080
Don't worry about the company for now.

125
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,080
You're absolutely right, as always.

126
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,960
In that case, I will respectfully
follow your suggestions.

127
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:25,920
Please.

128
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,680
OK.

129
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
Dou,

130
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,520
as expected, handing the company to you
is still the best choice.

131
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:39,960
You flatter me, Master Zhu.

132
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:42,320
You are my strong ally.

133
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,840
Lianhe Town certainly needs you.

134
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,400
As town mayor,

135
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,280
I will certainly do
whatever I can to help.

136
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,800
I've already disciplined Guanwen,

137
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,880
and I hope
you won't hold it against him.

138
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:01,360
As for me handing over
the shipping company to Bao'er previously,

139
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,440
it was to give the young people
more chance to practice.

140
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,400
But when it comes to
real business dealings,

141
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,240
we still need an experienced veteran
to take charge.

142
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,160
You're too kind.

143
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,160
Why would I fuss over trivial matters
with the younger generation?

144
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,320
I'm just

145
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:23,160
curious what goods you are transporting

146
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,240
so secretly this time.

147
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,960
Could you let me in on some details?

148
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,360
Since when have you taken an interest
in my business dealings?

149
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,080
I was just randomly asking.

150
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,640
Rest assured, Master Zhu.

151
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,040
I guarantee there will be no issues
with this shipment.

152
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,560
After all,
when your business is booming,

153
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,320
Lianhe Town will prosper as a result.

154
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,640
As the mayor,
I will naturally benefit as well.

155
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,080
Then let us toast
with tea instead of wine

156
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,240
to prosperity for Lianhe Town.

157
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,560
To prosperity for Lianhe Town!

158
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:10,720
Cheers.

159
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,920
