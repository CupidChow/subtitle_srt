(Why did she hide in there?)

why did you approach me?

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,880
It's certainly because Mr. Zhu Jr.

is a lady killer,

you understand these customs.

116
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:50,000
Since you are going to
marry into our Zhu family,

117
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,320
it's only right for you,
as the daughter-in-law,

118
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,600

as a sign of respect, isn't it?

You are right.

120

is a family heirloom,

126
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,080
so don't break it.

127
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,320
Since they all call you Second Madam Zhu,

128
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,720

please be more respectful
to my fiancee from now on,

Stop embarrassing the Zhu family anymore.

159

Why don't you have my back?

161
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,480
Who dares to bully you?

162
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,640
I've long heard

163
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,040
that the Zhu family, the foremost family
in Lianhe Town, has strict rules.

164
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,600
Since I'm engaged to Guanwen,

165
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,760
I consider myself
a part of the Zhu family.

166
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
Today, I dare to speak my mind.

167
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,760
Second Madam Zhu's actions might harm
the family's reputation if word gets out.

168
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,280
I heard that your father is Lin Yaoshan,
a wealthy businessman in Southeast Asia.

169
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:54,960
Ms. Lin,

170
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,720
you truly have the demeanor
of a prominent family.

171
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,240
You flatter me.

172
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,800
But I wonder

173
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,640
when did you get to know my son?

174
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,920
In the past few days,
we fell in love at first sight.

175
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,680
Though it has only been a few days,

176
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:14,520
we are truly compatible and congenial.

177
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,040
In that case,

178
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,040
I have nothing more to say.

179
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,080
Guanwen,

180
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:27,440
you should go
and apologize to Mr. Dou's these days.

181
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,240
Handle your own mess.

182
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,440
I have other matters to attend to.

183
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,920
Master Zhu.

184
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,720
How is it going?

185
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,400
Everything is ready.

186
