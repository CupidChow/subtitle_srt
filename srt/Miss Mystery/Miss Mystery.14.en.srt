185
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,480
If I didn't know what you were thinking,

186
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,360
I would've stormed off.

187
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,160
Guanwen...

188
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,640
Shh!

189
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,600
Driving me away

190
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:54,760
means no good to you at all
at this point.

191
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,680
Do you not care
if I really misunderstand you?

192
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,880
Compared to that,

193
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,560
I prefer not to get you hurt.

194
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,560
Bao'er,

195
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,280
you mean everything to me.

196
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,480
For you,
I can put aside my self-respect,

197
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,160
stubbornness,

198
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,400
and pride.

199
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,240
But what I fear most is losing you.

200
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,400
You're not alone now.

201
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,600
You have me.

202
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,880
I realized something today.

203
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,520
What?

204
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:29,400
I think

205
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,280
someone must have tipped them off.
