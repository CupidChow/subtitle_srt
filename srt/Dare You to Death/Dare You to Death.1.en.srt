1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:03,920
- You're up next for sure.
- Bell hasn't had a turn yet.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,880
- You've not done it yet.
- Yeah, you only order others to do it.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,520
- He's next, I'm telling you.
- You're up next.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,360
- Damn!
- Spin it your way now.

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,040
- Champ!
- Champ!

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,520
You're safe now.

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,880
So truth or dare?

8
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:28,920
Cheers!

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Come on!

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,040
- I knew it.
- Should have chosen dare.

11
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,959
Fai.

12
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,600
Fai.

13
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:10,160
Fai!

14
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,560
Fai, what's wrong?
Why aren't you waking up?

15
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,680
Fai!

16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,480
Fai!

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,080
Fai!

18
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,080
Fai!

19
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,320
What's wrong with Fai?

20
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,440
Hey, she's not breathing.

21
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,920
Fai!

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,680
Fai, don't die!

23
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Fai!

24
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,400
What should we do?

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,760
Fai!

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,720
Fai, don't die!

27
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,240
Fai, what's wrong?

28
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,920
Don't die. Wake up already.

29
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,040
Shit! You brat!

30
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,320
Hey, stop running!

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,360
Stop!

32
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,400
Hands up.

33
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,680
I said, hands up!

34
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,120
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- It's nothing, bro.

35
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,200
Nothing.

36
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
And what's this?

37
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
Vitamin C.

38
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,240
Vitamin C, my ass.

39
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,560
It's really Vitamin C.

40
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,680
I don't have a weapon.

41
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,480
You'd be breaking the law if you shot me.

42
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,720
Oh, really?

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
Shit!

44
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,640
Don't!

45
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll warn you twice.

46
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,520
If you still don't tell me,

47
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,280
I'll put the third one right in your head.

48
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,360
Don't act like you know the law.

49
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,160
Your case allows lethal force
if you threaten us or try to run.

50
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,080
Please don't.

51
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,600
- Three.
- Please don't.

52
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,800
Two.

53
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,200
Fine. I'm telling you now. I'm giving in.

54
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,880
The drugs are from Boss Laem.

55
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,400
They meet every Thursday night
to pick up drugs at Drink Me.

56
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,800
One.

57
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,240
Next time, don't run.

58
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,160
Damn.

59
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,640
Any more?

60
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,720
Move.

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,560
- Hello?
<i>- Hello, Jade.</i>

62
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,040
We got a report that some students
were drinking and one of them died.

63
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,160
Where?

64
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,400
<i>Akara University.</i>

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,040
- Have the local police arrived?
<i>- They're already there.</i>

66
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,480
But Commander Don told our team
to investigate.

67
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,200
One of the people at the scene
is MP Ratana's son.

68
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,720
<i>Commander doesn't want it to blow up.</i>

69
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,960
Got it.

70
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,880
You go first. I'll be there soon.

71
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,000
Roger.

72
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,760
But the new inspector is coming.

73
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:06,160
The one from abroad?

74
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,400
What kind of driving is that?

75
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:14,200
Hey!

76
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,360
You!

77
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,760
Didn't you see--

78
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,080
You're cutting lanes like that.

79
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,920
Do you know that's a traffic violation?

80
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,840
I'm sorry.
I'm not familiar with the roads here.

81
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,760
- Do you know--
- That's not right.

82
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:45,040
Not being familiar with the route
isn't an excuse.

83
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,840
Have you been drinking?

84
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,200
I haven't.

85
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,200
Are you done here?

86
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,440
Not yet.

87
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,800
Hey!

88
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,240
- Good evening, Captain.
- Evening.

89
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,560
- Issue me a ticket, please.
- A ticket?

90
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,360
- Thank you.
- All right then.

91
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,800
Your driver's license, please.

92
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:38,720
Mr. Kananon Wiriyasak.

93
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:44,280
Officer, what's your name?

94
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,360
Police Captain Jaruwat Chotsantrakul.

95
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,320
How much do you want?

96
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,840
You're trying to bribe an officer,
aren't you?

97
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,080
It's good to see that
this country still has

98
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
real law-abiding officers.

99
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,600
You think this is funny?

100
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,760
You broke traffic laws,
so you must pay the fine accordingly.

101
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,880
Here you are.

102
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:31,600
Next time, don't break traffic laws again.

103
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,880
Ken.

104
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,600
What's the situation?

105
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,080
Eight senior engineering students
were drinking after freshman initiation.

106
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,640
One was found deceased.

107
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,160
She's preliminarily identified as
Pawarisa Aiyaluk, age 22.

108
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,840
What about the others?

109
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,640
Preliminary questioning is done.

110
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,560
They're being sent to the Investigation
Division for further questioning.

111
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,360
Captain.

112
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,200
What is it?

113
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,760
The new inspector is here.

114
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,160
Didn't you say he'd come tomorrow?

115
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,880
Is he hardworking or just showing off?

116
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,320
Manmai, photograph every inch of the room.

117
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,840
On it.

118
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,520
Watch it.

119
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,320
You'll contaminate the prints.

120
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,240
Got it.

121
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,120
Where is the foreign-educated cop?

122
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,400
Over there.

123
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,400
You two know each other?

124
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,880
Captain Jade, hello.

125
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,320
Hello.

126
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,240
Hello, Captain Jade.

127
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,160
- Mr. Puth, please rush the results for me.
- Of course, Inspector.

128
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,720
FORENSICS

129
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:31,120
Why didn't you tell me
you're the new inspector?

130
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,480
You didn't ask,

131
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,520
and I'm not some power-hungry officer
who flashes a badge to everyone.

132
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,960
But this is good.

133
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,720
Now I can see how your team works.

134
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,520
I've seen a lot of people like you.

135
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,440
They all crash and burn in the end, boom,

136
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,480
drunk on power.

137
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,120
But I don't arrest people randomly
without evidence.

138
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,800
I perform my duties according to protocol,

139
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,800
unlike an officer like you
who works without a uniform

140
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,800
or proper identification.

141
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,600
This ticket should be invalid, right?

142
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,760
Initially, the victim's friends said
they were playing a game in the room.

143
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,920
Then everyone fell asleep.
When they woke up, Puifai was dead.

144
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,840
Forensics reports the time of death
is under 24 hours.

145
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,680
Run blood tests
on all the victim's friends.

146
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,680
Roger.

147
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,640
So you studied abroad.

148
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,880
Are you as good as those in the movies?

149
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
One look
and you already know what happened?

150
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:47,800
Which one is it, Inspector?

151
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:52,240
Is it murder or an accident?

152
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
I bet you've watched too many movies.

153
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:58,160
I'm not jumping to any conclusion.

154
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,000
How about we compete in solving this case?

155
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,920
If I win, I'll be your colleague,

156
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,720
not your subordinate.

157
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:11,640
Why would we turn
the public's suffering into a game?

158
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,240
Solving cases faster is better, isn't it?

159
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,560
Why?

160
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,200
Are you scared to compete with me?

161
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,320
Or are you afraid you'll lose to me?

162
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,400
If you want to compete, that's fine.

163
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,480
But let me warn you.

164
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,480
I've never lost.

165
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,240
What a coincidence.

166
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,360
Neither have I.

167
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,160
Jay?

168
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,720
- What are you doing here?
- Jade, I--

169
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,440
What are you doing here?

170
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:03,400
Captain, he's one of the seven suspects
in the death incident.

171
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,800
Please excuse me for now.

172
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,440
What happened?

173
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,880
- Jade, I didn't do anything!
- Hey.

174
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:11,920
Jay!

175
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,360
Your brother is one of the suspects.

176
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,480
You shouldn't be working this case.

177
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,000
Jay?

178
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:23,960
How is that possible?

179
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,000
I won't know

180
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,760
until I talk to him.

181
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,120
How about this?

182
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,480
If my brother is involved,

183
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,200
I'll press charges myself.

184
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,880
You should wait outside.

185
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,880
I'll question all seven of them.

186
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:54,200
And about our competition,

187
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,440
you can give up now if you want.

188
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,840
Mr. Jirawit Chotsantrakul.

189
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:10,400
You're Jade's younger brother?

190
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,560
Yes.

191
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:14,760
Jay, listen.

192
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,880
Whatever you say,

193
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,960
don't you dare lie.

194
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,240
<i>Understand?</i>

195
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,720
You're in the Avengers,
Mechanical Engineering, right?

196
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,160
It's a nickname people gave us.

197
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
But yes, I am.

198
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,440
<i>Tell me what happened.</i>

199
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,520
<i>After freshman initiation,</i>

200
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,960
the eight of us drank
in the faculty storage room.

201
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,560
<i>We were drinking beer and liquor as usual.</i>

202
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,160
<i>But Champ wanted to leave early,</i>

203
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,880
<i>so Cherreen and Fai begged him to stay.</i>

204
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,640
- Took you long enough, huh?
- Quit dragging it out, man.

205
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,160
<i>Were you playing a game?</i>

206
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,240
What game?

207
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,760
Truth or dare?

208
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,080
Dare.

209
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,120
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

210
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,440
We played for a while,
but what confused me

211
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,400
was everyone started
dozing off one by one.

212
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,640
<i>I remember I was</i>
<i>the last one to fall asleep.</i>

213
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
<i>But when I woke up,</i>

214
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,760
Puifai was already like that.

215
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:36,280
<i>You called the doctor first.</i>

216
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Why didn't you call the police right away?

217
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,840
We were hoping we could save her.

218
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,800
So who brought the booze?

219
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,800
I did.

220
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,080
But I didn't mix the drinks.

221
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,400
You're planning to drink it
all yourself, huh?

222
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,600
<i>Tonkla mixed it.</i>

223
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,640
Can I say something?

224
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,040
<i>I saw something weird.</i>

225
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,400
<i>What did you see?</i>

226
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,760
When the ice ran out
and I went to buy more,

227
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,440
<i>I saw Cherreen and Champ talking.</i>

228
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,640
<i>It looked like they were arguing.</i>

229
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
Arguing?

230
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,800
Are these two dating?

231
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,720
No.

232
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,240
Champ and Fai were together.

233
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:23,880
Cherreen is closest to Fai in the group.

234
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:27,920
So you're saying

235
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,480
Cherreen and Champ argued because of Fai?

236
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:32,680
Am I right?

237
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,120
Tell me.

238
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,560
When you woke up and found Fai dead,

239
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:41,720
why didn't anyone call the police?

240
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,800
You'd better ask Tar and Bell about this.

241
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,720
Who would've thought that

242
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,040
drinking could kill someone?

243
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,520
I wanted to help my friend,
so I called the ambulance first.

244
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,440
<i>That's all.</i>

245
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,440
But only Tar and you stopped the others
from calling the police.

246
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,800
Who said that?

247
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,880
Honestly, I didn't care.

248
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,520
They could've if they wanted.

249
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,839
Tar was the scared one.

250
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,680
Let's do this, okay?

251
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,000
<i>He did a lot of drugs.</i>

252
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,520
<i>No wonder he was scared.</i>

253
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:23,720
With everyone passed out,
it could have been Tar's doing.

254
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,520
That bitch--

255
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:31,920
Bell, right?
I know why she didn't want to call.

256
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,960
She slapped a junior and ruined her face.

257
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:38,560
She's brave only because
she thinks she has backup.

258
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,200
Time's dad is a cop.

259
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,760
Champ's dad is an MP,

260
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,920
and Jay's brother is a cop.

261
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,600
You little fucker.

262
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,280
One more word
and I'll knock your head off.

263
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,320
I quit drugs ages ago.

264
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,000
Are you sure you're not using drugs?

265
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,000
I'm clean.

266
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,920
Tonkla Parit Kritniwat.

267
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,360
Your friend said you mixed the drinks.

268
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,760
Yeah.

269
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,440
But not when I went to pee.

270
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,400
Can you recall everything that happened?

271
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,640
Time and I came to prepare the room first.

272
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,480
Then Jay, Bell, Cherreen,

273
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,000
and Tar came later.

274
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,320
Champ and Puifai arrived last.

275
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,880
Nothing much happened afterward.
We just kept drinking like normal.

276
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,080
Then Cherreen and Fai started a game.

277
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:55,600
Then Time got wasted first,

278
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,720
followed by Bell.

279
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,240
Who do you think did it?

280
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,120
Champ, maybe.

281
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,920
He's Fai's boyfriend, right?

282
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,880
His girlfriend died and he felt nothing?

283
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,120
Were you and Fai dating?

284
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,880
Yes.

285
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,200
We've been together
since our sophomore year.

286
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:23,440
<i>Fai was sweet, kind,</i>

287
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,600
<i>and our families got along well.</i>

288
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,040
Then why didn't you seem sad
when she died?

289
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,760
I was probably in shock.

290
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,840
And I happen to be good
at hiding my emotions.

291
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:43,920
Did Fai act unusually before that?

292
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,840
She took sleeping pills

293
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,480
and she had stomach ulcers.

294
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:51,600
She could barely drink.

295
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:54,840
Can I go now?

296
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,840
- Talk to my lawyer.
- No.

297
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,880
Sit down.

298
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:06,000
<i>You're one of the suspects.</i>

299
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,440
Sit.

300
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,800
<i>Why so many questions?</i>

301
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,320
<i>How long is this going to take?</i>

302
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,800
<i>It's such a waste of time.</i>

303
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:21,960
CONTROL ROOM

304
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,720
I'm sorry, it might take a while.

305
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,160
It's okay, Jade.

306
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,040
Tell me about Champ and Puifai.

307
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:38,000
Champ and Puifai?

308
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,000
Yes.

309
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,640
What were they like at the faculty

310
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,560
and at home?

311
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:56,720
Champ is the son of Mr. Ratana,
the district MP.

312
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:03,160
He's fun at the faculty.

313
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:13,800
He's rich, so he has a lot of friends.

314
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,200
His girlfriend was Fai.

315
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,880
They looked happy together.

316
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,920
They seemed like a good match.

317
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,240
I heard they'd marry after graduation.

318
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:31,240
Did Fai have any medical conditions?

319
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,400
She always took sleeping pills

320
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,360
and she had stomach ulcers.

321
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,840
Fai, slow down.

322
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,440
You've been sick these days.

323
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:48,280
Yeah, right.
If you can't handle it, say so.

324
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,480
Of course, I'm fine.

325
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,120
It's the last initiation.

326
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:53,360
How could I not be?

327
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,400
But if anything happens, I'll tell you.

328
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,480
So I'm not really sure…

329
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,640
Maybe Fai died because she drank too much.

330
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,000
On the night it happened,

331
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,400
when you woke up and saw her,

332
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,120
what was it like?

333
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,080
Everyone panicked.

334
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,800
Once we calmed down,

335
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,640
Tonkla called an ambulance right away.

336
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,680
- Who are you to arrest my son?
- Calm down, sir.

337
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm just doing my job.

338
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,960
Your son was at the scene,

339
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,160
so I have to question him.

340
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,000
Then talk to my lawyer.

341
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,120
Come on, Champ. We're leaving.

342
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,120
- Wait!
- Calm down, Inspector.

343
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,400
My apologies, sir.

344
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,560
He's new here.

345
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,720
If there's anything else,
I'll contact you.

346
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:52,400
Thank you for your understanding.

347
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,640
You messed with the right person.

348
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,680
That kid is MP Ratana's son.

349
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,000
So what?

350
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,720
I still want the truth.

351
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,680
Now that drugs are involved,

352
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,040
I'll push for the forensic results.

353
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,840
Already pushing things on your first day?

354
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,520
We've still got something else to do.

355
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,720
Like what?

356
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,600
Taking your brother out to eat.

357
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,840
Why didn't you tell me Tar and Bell
stopped you from calling the police?

358
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,400
I didn't want them to get in trouble.

359
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,440
Why make a big deal of it?

360
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,520
You're protecting your friends,
but ignoring the dead?

361
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,680
Are you longtime friends?

362
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:02,040
Since freshman year.

363
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,080
I'm not asking as a cop.

364
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:13,400
I'm asking as your brother.

365
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:22,640
I don't think
anyone did anything to Puifai.

366
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,840
I trust my friends.

367
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,320
I don't know any good places around here.

368
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
I just moved back from abroad.

369
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,960
Where from?

370
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,840
I graduated in law from the U.S.

371
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,880
You just moved here
and you're already his boss?

372
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,480
First day here
and you're already talking big.

373
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,200
You argue with your friends a lot?

374
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,320
Arguments happen, of course.

375
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,960
But the worst fight was…

376
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:16,200
between Champ, Puifai, and Tar.

377
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:17,880
Tar?

378
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,240
That dude with glasses.

379
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:26,000
It happened after the freshman initiation
in our second year.

380
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:28,200
We went to drink at Time's place.

381
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,920
Tar…

382
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,440
tried to make a move on Fai.

383
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,480
He thought she liked him,
that she'd been leading him on.

384
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,200
But Fai was just nice to everyone.

385
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:43,960
She was kind.

386
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,120
Luckily, Champ stepped in to help,

387
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,400
and the two of them started dating.

388
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,560
None of them held that against Tar?

389
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,120
Champ didn't want us to break apart,

390
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,760
so he told everyone
to pretend nothing happened.

391
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,320
Why didn't you mention this
during questioning?

392
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,200
What's with you?

393
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,640
Are you hiding something else from us?

394
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,800
I'm telling you now, aren't I?

395
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,440
With the way you talk,
who would want to say anything?

396
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,080
I'm asking you nicely, so just answer.

397
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,040
Wow, you're dramatic.

398
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:31,560
Why did you bring so much stuff?

399
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:33,840
I came to work,

400
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,320
not to fool around.

401
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,720
Everyone seems to want to mess with you.

402
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,840
Let me warn you.

403
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,760
This isn't overseas.

404
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,520
Here, the one with more allies survives.

405
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:56,880
Then go through all the footage.

406
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:00,600
Once you're done,
I'll review the forensics.

407
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,800
Got it.

408
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,200
But I'm taking a nap first.

409
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,600
Go ahead.

410
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,040
Then I'll finally know
how Thai police really work.

411
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,000
Whether you're Thai or foreign police,

412
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,600
even if you investigate all night,

413
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,200
you still need some rest.

414
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:22,560
Criminals don't rest,
so why should the police?

415
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:26,240
If you're lazy and useless
and keep dragging this case down,

416
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,880
I'll report you to HQ.

417
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,480
What?

418
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,480
- Are you a snitch?
- It's not snitching.

419
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,240
It's simply reporting facts.

420
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:38,600
Try doing something worthy
of the taxpayers' money.

421
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,440
First case here and it's already
a big one, Inspector Kamin.

422
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,120
Hello, Commander Don.

423
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:55,000
You're aware that one of the suspects
is MP Ratana's son,

424
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,840
and another is
a high-ranking police officer's child?

425
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,360
Yes, sir.

426
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:02,200
I'll handle the case properly.

427
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,120
No worries.

428
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,600
There's another case.

429
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,880
A dealer and a major distributor.

430
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,040
I expect progress on both cases soon.

431
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,760
Yes, Commander.

432
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,880
You're under a lot of pressure, Inspector.

433
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:31,000
So?

434
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,000
Are you going to give up?

435
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,920
If I gave up,

436
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,520
I wouldn't be an inspector.

437
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,080
Don't worry, Inspector.

438
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:16,440
No CCTV here and no wiretaps either.

439
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,360
I cleared them myself.

440
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,360
That's exactly what scares me.

441
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,880
Is something bothering you?

442
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,480
I think these seven kids

443
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,640
are hiding something from us.

444
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,080
And this one is the worst liar.

445
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:46,000
Champ, why did you send me the letter?
What crap are you trying to pull on me?

446
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,760
I'm sure Tar is on drugs.

447
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,160
If we find his supplier,

448
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:55,480
maybe we'll know
what really happened that night.

449
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,840
Do you know Drink Me?

450
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,840
They meet every Thursday night
to pick up drugs at Drink Me.

451
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,760
Yes, I do.

452
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,720
We still need the forensic

453
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,560
and autopsy results
for the Avengers student case.

454
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,600
I'll switch to this case first.

455
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,080
Do you normally work like this?

456
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,240
Like what?

457
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,880
Solo.

458
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,360
No consultation with the team.

459
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,800
And should I be asking how you work?

460
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,520
It depends on whether
it's a question or an invitation.

461
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,760
- Hello.
- Hello.

462
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,840
Two skewers of chicken tail, please.

463
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,400
Here you go, two.

464
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,760
You're such a neat person.

465
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,960
I like things clean.

466
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:28,640
You're bringing me to a club now.

467
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,800
What do we get from this?

468
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,840
Hey, one bag of sticky rice, please.

469
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,040
Where did you get these?

470
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:57,440
I have my own informant.

471
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,640
Did you dress to party or investigate?

472
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,640
You're not dressed
any differently than me, Inspector.

473
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,640
Welcome.

474
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,080
Please come in.

475
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,560
Sure, right this way.

476
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,800
Have you booked a table?

477
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:37,760
Not yet.

478
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,800
Yes, it's under Jade.

479
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:48,360
Welcome.
What would you like for your first drink?

480
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,880
Sparkling water, please.

481
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,200
And you, sir?

482
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,440
Something strong.

483
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,320
Sparkling water?

484
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,520
It's soda water.

485
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,280
Don't you understand English?

486
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,040
Can you try to be a bit more subtle?

487
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,960
Babe, don't sulk, okay?

488
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:13,040
I just wanted to kiss your cheek.

489
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,239
See?

490
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,600
Bro, can you mix it a bit faster? Thanks.

491
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,639
Thanks. Here you go, babe.

492
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:30,920
"Babe"? Seriously?

493
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,440
You could've played other roles.

494
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,400
Just go along with it, okay?

495
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,040
I'm blending in here.

496
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,199
Do you always wipe tables at clubs?

497
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,520
I don't drink on duty.

498
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,800
Hi.

499
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,000
Mind if we toast?

500
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:12,240
Are you two dating?

501
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,400
What do you think of my taste?

502
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,000
We're just friends.

503
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,040
So you're single. That's perfect.

504
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,080
Join us at the table over there.

505
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,600
My boy isn't available.

506
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,880
You think flashing your gun
is a good idea?

507
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,280
There are a lot of creeps around here.

508
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,640
I can handle myself.

509
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,760
If I let you handle it,

510
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,520
are you sure you can?

511
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,520
What are you doing?

512
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,280
Hey.

513
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:26,000
If you walk in like that,
you'll get killed.

514
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,280
Wait until they make the drop
and I'll call for backup.

515
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,880
- What's wrong?
- That dealer's guy knows me.

516
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,360
He knows I'm a cop.

517
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,400
Are they starting?

518
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:19,760
They're starting.

519
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,880
TEAM X: READY TO RAID.

520
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,080
Pleasure doing business with you.

521
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:44,560
Yeah.

522
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,040
Where's my guy?

523
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,080
He'll be here.

524
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:51,160
Hey!

525
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,760
Hey! What the hell?

526
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,920
This is the police!

527
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,400
You are under arrest
for drug distribution and possession!

528
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,240
- Shit!
- Go!

529
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,360
Shoot them!

530
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,360
- Stop!
- Go!

531
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,680
Go!

532
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,600
Inspector!

533
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,120
Hey! Stop!

534
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,240
I'll handle it.

535
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,560
Stop!

536
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,960
Turn around.

537
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,800
Turn around!

538
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:45,000
Hey!

539
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,040
Nice aim, Inspector.

540
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,720
Standard.

541
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,560
Get in!

542
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:20,280
You wrapped up
your first case well, Inspector.

543
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:22,000
It was like peeling a banana,

544
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,800
except you peeled it with a gun.

545
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,680
TRAFFIC CITATION ISSUED
BY A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

546
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,920
What are you doing?

547
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:44,480
In case you planned on driving home.

548
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:49,720
I didn't even drink that much.

549
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:52,480
And I was drinking for work.

550
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,600
Give me your car key.

551
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,080
Lieutenant.

552
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,240
Take his car back to HQ.

553
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:08,160
Roger.

554
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,640
And you, come with me.

555
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,080
I'm staying here.

556
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,880
Wait.

557
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,920
You're staying somewhere
this fancy, Inspector?

558
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,240
Why?

559
00:40:50,080 --> 00:40:51,680
I pay for comfort.

560
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,160
Hold on.

561
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,800
So why did you bring me here?

562
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:03,880
Or are you…

563
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,600
taking me all the way to your room?

564
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,760
Is that all you think about?

565
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:11,800
Well?

566
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,200
What do you expect me to think?

567
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:26,320
For you.

568
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,440
Thank you.

569
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:40,280
What were you thinking
bringing me up here to hang out?

570
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,880
You like drinking, don't you?

571
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:46,840
At Drink Me,
you never put your glass down,

572
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:51,320
so I wanted to buy you one
as a thank-you for our first case.

573
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:56,320
You know how to say
"thank you," Inspector?

574
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,160
I don't like owing people.

575
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:02,720
Don't worry.

576
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,160
You should be glad
you've got me as a subordinate.

577
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,440
I'm the best investigator
in the whole unit.

578
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,760
That's good

579
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:13,880
if you can back it up.

580
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:47,640
BOSS, DON'T BE SO HARSH
OR YOU'LL TURN INTO A DOG.

581
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,840
I'll be in your care from now on,

582
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,840
Inspector Kamin.

583
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,680
Hey!

584
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:42,440
Are you okay?

585
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,000
Well, you're standing in my way.

586
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:47,600
Of course I bumped into you.

587
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,080
What? I'm drunk.

588
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:54,880
Please, officer.

589
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:57,840
Don't tell anyone you work under me.

590
00:43:58,640 --> 00:43:59,480
I'll be embarrassed.

591
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:04,680
Someone like me

592
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,320
never accepts anyone as my boss.

593
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,400
But if I ever do,

594
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,120
it'll only be…

595
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:16,280
the owner of my heart.

596
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:21,240
Hey!

597
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:28,200
I'll drive you home tonight, okay?

598
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,280
Gotcha!

599
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,760
Are you thinking something about me?

600
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:39,720
Or you can sleep here if you want.

601
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:41,480
What?

602
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,880
Hey! Inspector!

603
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,400
Wow, seriously?

604
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,760
You're just leaving a drunk guy here?

605
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,000
Are you coming or not?

606
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,840
Okay, fine. Hold on.

607
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:58,280
Jeez.

608
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,000
Hey…

609
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,160
You even opened the door for me.

610
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:14,800
Just hurry up and get in.

611
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,800
Thank you.

612
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:33,400
Watch your leg.

613
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,680
Are you worried about me?

614
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,560
<i>Doctor, what do the test results say?</i>

615
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:42,240
Based on the results,
I'd consider it a murder.

616
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:45,680
<i>Do you think the two of us</i>
<i>can really stop this?</i>

617
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,400
<i>If we work together,</i>

618
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,720
we'll catch the killer.

619
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,280
<i>You command people with your mouth?</i>

620
00:45:51,360 --> 00:45:52,960
<i>Why not?</i>

621
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:54,840
<i>My mouth works</i>

622
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,840
pretty well.
