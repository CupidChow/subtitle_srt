1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:16,610
DARE YOU TO DEATH SPECIAL: FILE UNLOCKED

2
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:29,483
Cheers!

3
00:00:36,386 --> 00:00:36,824
Fai!

4
00:00:38,027 --> 00:00:38,950
Fai, what’s wrong?

5
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:40,000
Why aren’t you waking up?

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,398
Fai, don’t die!

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:45,367
JOONG ARCHEN AS JET / DUNK NATACHAI AS KAMIN

8
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,894
Dare You To Death.
JOONG ARCHEN AS JET / DUNK NATACHAI AS KAMIN

9
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:53,453
The name of this series,
Dare You To Death, comes from the plot.

10
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,644
In the story,
a group of university students

11
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,569
play the game called “Truth or Dare?”

12
00:01:00,156 --> 00:01:03,495
This game becomes the main driving force
that pushes the story forward.

13
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:11,598
They play this game, and one
of the players that night is dead.

14
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:12,189
That’s right.

15
00:01:12,287 --> 00:01:14,958
So the two of us have to
investigate the case.

16
00:01:15,006 --> 00:01:18,501
This group of students is called Avengers.

17
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,770
Did anyone get a Truth or Dare letter?

18
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,332
I got one already.

19
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:24,210
Champ, why did you send me the letter?

20
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,421
What kind of crap
are you trying to pull on me?!

21
00:01:25,721 --> 00:01:28,090
Truth or Dare is the game
OHM THIPAKORN AS JAY

22
00:01:28,261 --> 00:01:29,520
that drives the entire series.

23
00:01:29,598 --> 00:01:35,312
Every incident that happens
connects to the Truth or Dare tasks

24
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,743
that are sent to each student.

25
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,727
Truth or Dare is an important element
PAHN PATHITTA AS PUIFAI

26
00:01:40,730 --> 00:01:44,804
that appears throughout the whole series,
PAHN PATHITTA AS PUIFAI

27
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:48,966
so each character gradually reveals
their own conflicts.

28
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:53,695
Actually, this series is
mainly about solving the case

29
00:01:53,758 --> 00:01:57,086
because seven students
have to be questioned.

30
00:01:57,183 --> 00:01:59,669
When these two characters meet,
it’s mostly them working together,

31
00:01:59,712 --> 00:02:02,580
but there’s a little flirting
while they’re on the case.

32
00:02:02,606 --> 00:02:06,857
That’s another cute aspect
between these two police officers.

33
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,252
The new inspector is here.

34
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,200
Is he hardworking or just showing off?

35
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,049
Hello, Captain Jet.

36
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,907
I’m Joong Archen.

37
00:02:17,946 --> 00:02:19,567
I play Captain Jet.

38
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,000
Captain Jet’s character—

39
00:02:24,046 --> 00:02:28,450
if we describe it using a term
from this generation,

40
00:02:28,989 --> 00:02:31,001
I’d say he has puppy-boy vibes.

41
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:35,226
But actually,
he’s already in his thirties.

42
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:39,598
The story unfolds when a new inspector
is assigned to the precinct.

43
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:47,614
Captain Jet, a strong and
well-respected officer,

44
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,805
wants to know
what the new inspector is like

45
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:52,800
and what kind of person he is,

46
00:02:52,869 --> 00:02:58,550
so he looks into it himself
to see who he really is.

47
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:03,400
Jet has a lot of energy—

48
00:03:04,176 --> 00:03:08,101
jumping, kicking, punching,
shooting, very action-driven.

49
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,669
But he’s someone who likes
to joke around at work.

50
00:03:15,255 --> 00:03:16,629
He has a rule.

51
00:03:16,906 --> 00:03:19,101
If he’s at home,
he’ll never talk about work.

52
00:03:19,821 --> 00:03:22,446
But Kamin doesn’t believe that.

53
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:25,255
He can work anywhere, even at home.

54
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:26,859
So they’re different.

55
00:03:27,404 --> 00:03:28,952
Actually, these two characters
are very different.

56
00:03:29,264 --> 00:03:34,135
When it comes to work,
as a police officer, he’s very strict.

57
00:03:34,193 --> 00:03:35,303
What should I call it?

58
00:03:36,129 --> 00:03:40,303
He’s a tough boss, a leader to his team.

59
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,067
From my point of view,
SING HARIT AS PUTH

60
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,320
Captain Jet is bold, daring,
SING HARIT AS PUTH

61
00:03:46,946 --> 00:03:47,800
kind of a smart-ass,

62
00:03:47,823 --> 00:03:50,863
with a sharp tongue, but courageous.

63
00:03:51,501 --> 00:03:56,458
Captain Jet is tough
and has strong leadership.

64
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:00,996
Because of that, he often
forgets other people’s feelings.

65
00:04:01,036 --> 00:04:04,915
It’s true, he means well
for his younger brother

66
00:04:04,935 --> 00:04:06,158
and everyone around him,

67
00:04:06,181 --> 00:04:14,395
but the way he expresses it isn’t pleasing
to the people who hear it.

68
00:04:14,792 --> 00:04:18,926
Especially his younger brother,
who has no one left except his brother.

69
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:26,103
Many of Jet’s words hurt Jay
and make him put up walls.

70
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:30,053
Jet lives with his younger brother,
the only brother he has.

71
00:04:30,269 --> 00:04:33,598
In his life, he only has his brother,
and his brother only has him.

72
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:36,300
There’s a bit of single-father energy,

73
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:38,500
but in the form of an older brother.

74
00:04:38,804 --> 00:04:39,664
I’m so excited.

75
00:04:39,776 --> 00:04:40,995
(You remember that, Joong.)

76
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:47,330
(Careful, careful.)

77
00:04:48,386 --> 00:04:50,001
How challenging is it
to portray this character?

78
00:04:50,366 --> 00:04:53,671
Since I’m 24 and I’m not
actually a police officer,

79
00:04:53,732 --> 00:04:55,432
it feels pretty far from my real life.

80
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,183
Besides police terminology in the script,

81
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:06,097
there are a lot of action scenes—

82
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:08,926
chasing criminals, arresting suspects,

83
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,402
getting ambushed,
and tons of fight choreography.

84
00:05:14,538 --> 00:05:16,283
We did gun workshops too.

85
00:05:16,298 --> 00:05:20,655
We practiced shooting, learned how to
hold and carry the gun,

86
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:25,998
where it should be and
where it shouldn’t be when walking,

87
00:05:26,069 --> 00:05:30,000
and how to control my body
while holding a gun.

88
00:05:31,135 --> 00:05:32,984
Then, how about we compete
on solving this case?

89
00:05:33,621 --> 00:05:34,395
I’ve never lost.

90
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,698
In this series, I play Inspector Kamin.

91
00:05:37,893 --> 00:05:42,152
He’s very serious about his work.

92
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,361
He’s calm, stern,

93
00:05:43,387 --> 00:05:46,100
and has moved back from the U.S.

94
00:05:46,124 --> 00:05:48,727
Since he’s a police officer from abroad,

95
00:05:48,832 --> 00:05:52,695
he experiences some culture shock
coming back to Thailand,

96
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,744
like wondering,
“Is this how people work here?”

97
00:05:54,763 --> 00:05:58,972
Even his outfits clearly show his style.

98
00:05:59,006 --> 00:06:02,799
He likes to wear suits and ties,
looking very neat.

99
00:06:02,975 --> 00:06:07,649
Actually, he’s Thai
but studied in the U.S.

100
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:11,806
At some point, his family
got tired of America.

101
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:17,152
He graduated, worked, got fed up,
so they wanted to come back to Thailand.

102
00:06:17,178 --> 00:06:20,761
They sold everything
and returned to Thailand.

103
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:24,458
Inspector Kamin contrasts Captain Jet.

104
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:27,013
Okay, they’re both hardworking
and share similar visions,

105
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:32,097
but Kamin is calmer, maybe because
he comes from a different police unit,

106
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,550
which makes his work culture different.

107
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:41,024
Inspector Kamin is empathetic
and highly disciplined.

108
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,252
If you ask whether he’s similar to Jet,

109
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:46,512
from Jay’s point of view,
he’d say they’re alike in some ways.

110
00:06:46,638 --> 00:06:52,448
They’re both precise, tough,
and have leadership.

111
00:06:52,958 --> 00:06:57,249
Inspector Kamin is quiet and composed.

112
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,600
He tries to solve problems
ASHI PEERAKAN AS TONKLA

113
00:06:58,952 --> 00:07:02,203
through thinking and analysis,

114
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:05,402
which is different from Captain Jet,
who sometimes resorts to force.

115
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,216
As for his lifestyle, outside of work,

116
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:16,316
Kamin mostly thinks alone,
acts alone, and stays alone.

117
00:07:16,492 --> 00:07:21,503
He’s the boss of his own life
and every department he leads.

118
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:23,938
He’s extremely meticulous.

119
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:26,613
His hobby is swimming.

120
00:07:26,686 --> 00:07:27,948
He swims alone.

121
00:07:28,764 --> 00:07:31,824
He enjoys many things alone.

122
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:34,589
If it were me in real life,
I would want to do them with friends,

123
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:36,080
but Kamin can do everything by himself.

124
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,346
You can give up now if you want.

125
00:07:38,693 --> 00:07:41,099
Then I’ll finally understand
how Thai police really work.

126
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,683
To portray Kamin,
I did a lot of preparation.

127
00:07:46,796 --> 00:07:50,051
The first thing I want to mention is
the physical side— my body.

128
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:53,921
Kamin is a bigger guy.

129
00:07:53,998 --> 00:08:00,267
He has that American-cop stereotype:
big build, cool with a gun, muscular.

130
00:08:00,332 --> 00:08:04,800
So I tried to bulk up for this role.

131
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:08,058
We also had workshops—

132
00:08:08,086 --> 00:08:11,918
gun handling, shooting, combat, fighting.

133
00:08:12,670 --> 00:08:19,846
We actually trained with real soldiers,
who truly know how to use guns.

134
00:08:19,978 --> 00:08:21,189
On top of that,

135
00:08:21,243 --> 00:08:23,940
I had to study how police speak—
their rhythms,

136
00:08:23,981 --> 00:08:26,504
and the specific terminology they use.

137
00:08:26,763 --> 00:08:27,700
The difficulty?

138
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:29,773
First of all, this outfit is so tight.

139
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,615
Wait.

140
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:36,602
Fighting while wearing
this outfit is not easy.

141
00:08:36,672 --> 00:08:38,330
It felt like Mr. Smith,

142
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:44,483
but under the 40-degree Thai sun,

143
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,496
shooting straight down on us,
and I still had to fight through

144
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,752
more than ten takes in this tight outfit.

145
00:08:49,806 --> 00:08:51,703
That was a real challenge.

146
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,553
Inspector Kamin is—
JUNE WANWIMOL AS CHERREEN

147
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:56,650
Well, I already know Dunk.

148
00:08:56,695 --> 00:09:01,198
In real life, he’s a bit goofy,

149
00:09:01,481 --> 00:09:05,472
but in the series, he has to keep cool
and stay composed.

150
00:09:05,756 --> 00:09:08,752
Whenever we entered a scene together,
I almost couldn’t help laughing.

151
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,847
What’s interesting about this story is

152
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,303
seeing how two people who are both
natural leaders manage to stay together.

153
00:09:16,635 --> 00:09:18,927
Will one yield to the other
and let him lead?

154
00:09:18,947 --> 00:09:22,775
Or what moment will make them
soften toward each other?

155
00:09:23,201 --> 00:09:25,250
Why did you move back
from the U.S. to Thailand?

156
00:09:25,427 --> 00:09:26,696
What did your partner say about it?

157
00:09:28,563 --> 00:09:29,348
My partner?

158
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,598
I don’t have one.

159
00:09:35,713 --> 00:09:40,293
We’ve been together under
GMMTV for four years,

160
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:44,095
and this is our fourth project.

161
00:09:44,358 --> 00:09:46,743
It’s extremely challenging.

162
00:09:46,766 --> 00:09:50,685
As I said, there are police ethics,

163
00:09:50,707 --> 00:09:53,781
police terminology,
and so many new things for us.

164
00:09:53,798 --> 00:09:56,416
So we had to attend a lot of workshops.

165
00:09:56,446 --> 00:09:58,709
Yes, there was a lot of pressure.

166
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,618
Compared to previous projects,

167
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:05,084
I feel this role is pretty far
from who I am.

168
00:10:05,112 --> 00:10:07,343
It’s a very serious series.

169
00:10:07,430 --> 00:10:09,756
We almost didn’t improvise at all

170
00:10:09,784 --> 00:10:12,613
because we had to strictly
follow the script.

171
00:10:12,627 --> 00:10:15,412
We didn’t go off course.

172
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,300
It’s one of the toughest roles
I’ve played so far.

173
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:20,330
He appears.

174
00:10:21,915 --> 00:10:23,795
Wow!

175
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:24,783
End it cool.

176
00:10:24,929 --> 00:10:30,500
Joong, who plays Jet, is already serious,

177
00:10:30,567 --> 00:10:33,303
and he really wanted to do this.

178
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,212
Actually, both of us wanted to be in
Dare You To Death

179
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,401
since we saw the first teaser.

180
00:10:37,492 --> 00:10:40,699
We felt this series would be fun,

181
00:10:41,003 --> 00:10:43,401
and something completely new for us.

182
00:10:43,587 --> 00:10:45,056
We get to play police officers,
act more mature.

183
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,673
He’s always wanted a more adult role,

184
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:50,329
so he’s satisfied, very satisfied now.

185
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:51,076
I was so into it.

186
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:55,698
I watched a lot of
police movies and shorts

187
00:10:55,730 --> 00:11:00,427
because I wanted to prepare
for this role as best as I could.

188
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,927
I wanted to do my best.

189
00:11:03,356 --> 00:11:04,403
This is the police!

190
00:11:04,755 --> 00:11:07,996
You are under arrest for
drug distribution and possession!

191
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:10,196
Working with JoongDunk in this series—

192
00:11:10,306 --> 00:11:13,552
I worked with Joong before in Home School.

193
00:11:13,764 --> 00:11:15,627
I saw how much
he has grown in this series.

194
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:16,903
He’s very dedicated,

195
00:11:17,132 --> 00:11:24,175
and outside of acting,
during breaks on set,

196
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,796
he’s always creating content,

197
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:31,101
filming photos and videos,
and inviting others to join.

198
00:11:31,435 --> 00:11:35,703
He’s active, full of energy,
gets along well with others,

199
00:11:35,918 --> 00:11:36,906
and takes care of people well.

200
00:11:37,301 --> 00:11:38,053
That’s Joong.

201
00:11:38,358 --> 00:11:39,402
As for Dunk,

202
00:11:39,829 --> 00:11:43,252
when we worked together,
I realized he’s very dedicated.

203
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,506
He did his homework.

204
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:52,204
Whenever we made adjustments on set,
he was open and adapted immediately.

205
00:11:52,781 --> 00:11:54,900
Working with the P’Joong and P’Dunk—

206
00:11:55,230 --> 00:11:56,980
ever since I joined the company,
PROM TEEPAKRON AS TIME

207
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,198
my first acting class was with them.
PROM TEEPAKRON AS TIME

208
00:11:59,843 --> 00:12:01,413
We already know each other.

209
00:12:01,426 --> 00:12:03,355
It’s fun.

210
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:04,996
They’re both very sweet.

211
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,303
They often asked me to do TikTok dances.

212
00:12:07,336 --> 00:12:07,983
They’re adorable.

213
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,060
Between photos and real life,
which one is more handsome?

214
00:12:12,112 --> 00:12:13,347
Well, obviously the photo.

215
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,220
DARE YOU TO DEATH SPECIAL: FILE UNLOCKED

216
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:35,550
Who would’ve thought that
just drinking could kill someone?

217
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,750
You’re sure you’re not using drugs?

218
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,150
They looked happy together.

219
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,350
Then why didn’t you seem sad?

220
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,600
I was probably in shock.

221
00:12:41,620 --> 00:12:42,610
But when I woke up,

222
00:12:42,630 --> 00:12:44,150
Puifai was already like that

223
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,890
Whatever you say, don’t you dare lie.

224
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,060
The Avengers gang?
JOONG ARCHEN AS JET / DUNK NATACHAI AS KAMIN

225
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,440
This gang consists of Chimon,
Pahn, Earn, Ohm

226
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:59,590
Aungpao, June, Ashi and Prom.

227
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:04,580
Every character in this series is crucial
to moving the story forward.

228
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,360
It’s like playing Monopoly.

229
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:10,980
You move step by step,
opening one room at a time.

230
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,680
This gang is always chaotic.

231
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,480
Every time they’re together,
something wild happens.

232
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:20,250
There’s always some life-or-death drama.

233
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:22,550
You can spot their gimmick
every time they meet.

234
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:24,860
WHO IS… THE REAL KILLER?

235
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,180
If my brother is involved,

236
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,390
I’ll press charges myself.

237
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,730
I play Jay, the younger brother of Jet,
OHM THIPAKORN AS JAY

238
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,300
who’s a police officer.
OHM THIPAKORN AS JAY

239
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:44,080
He’s basically a normal teenager,

240
00:13:44,110 --> 00:13:48,380
who’s still immature,
doesn’t understand many things,

241
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:51,600
and is extremely attached to his friends.

242
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:56,610
The story begins when one person
in the group is murdered.

243
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:59,610
Jet’s younger brother is at the scene.

244
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,280
You can’t deny the connection.

245
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,680
They’re friends, so of course
there’s some involvement,

246
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,990
and Puifai also dies mysteriously.

247
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,510
From his brother’s perspective,

248
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:13,890
Jay is a character
who can’t do much on his own,

249
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,650
and he always relies on his brother.

250
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:20,750
He’s not skilled, and he still
won’t listen to his brother,

251
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:22,710
who constantly worries about him.

252
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:24,190
He’s a playful character.

253
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,900
He loves his friend.
CHIMON WACHIRAWIT AS CHAMP

254
00:14:27,150 --> 00:14:33,030
Jay’s bold and impulsive.

255
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,610
If there’s a problem,
he’s the one who jumps in first.
AUNGPAO OCHIRIS AS TAR

256
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,220
AUNGPAO OCHIRIS AS TAR

257
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:40,360
From my point of view,
he doesn’t think too much.
AUNGPAO OCHIRIS AS TAR

258
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:44,250
He just goes with the flow
and follows the group’s vibe.

259
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:47,150
He’s always in his head, full of thoughts,

260
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,320
always trying to help his friends.

261
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,800
In the group,

262
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,550
Jay’s the one who supports his friends.
EARN PREEYAPHAT AS BELL

263
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,460
He loves them.
EARN PREEYAPHAT AS BELL

264
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,720
He’s a good friend.

265
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,270
Tonkla feels he can talk to Jay
and ask for advice.

266
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:03,450
They’re quite close.

267
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,550
“I’m not your little brother!”

268
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:07,780
I’m not Jay!

269
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,480
“But I’m—”

270
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,180
It’s my first time working with Ohm.

271
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,600
He’s surprisingly mature,

272
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,080
like how he speaks,
how he carries himself,

273
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,080
both on set and in acting.

274
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,590
I think he’s pretty mature.

275
00:15:24,810 --> 00:15:29,120
You can’t really read him,
which works perfectly for me

276
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:34,300
since I have to play his brother
who doesn’t understand what he wants.

277
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:39,250
Ohm gives me exactly that vibe,
which works well in terms of acting.

278
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:40,520
3…2…

279
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:41,650
Imagine there’s only one.

280
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:43,600
Look at me.

281
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,820
Fine. Just take it.

282
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,940
I play Puifai.
PAHN PATHITTA AS PUIFAI

283
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:57,700
She’s optimistic

284
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:02,750
and has always lived surrounded by love
from her family and friends.

285
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:11,220
She’s the “good girl” of the group,
being sweet, polite, and well-behaved.

286
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:15,350
She’s almost like the group’s image.

287
00:16:16,670 --> 00:16:25,440
Puifai is cheerful and is dating Champ,
who is also in the group.

288
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:29,700
Puifai has been dating Champ
since college.

289
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:31,610
They have been together for a long time,

290
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:32,450
and they love each other.

291
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:36,150
Tongkla doesn’t interact with Puifai much,

292
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,350
but he sees her as sweet
and quiet in the group.

293
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:46,440
She’s polite, quiet, cute,

294
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:47,850
and keeps everything to herself.

295
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:52,530
She never shows how she really feels,
and she has a lot of hidden depth.

296
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,750
Puifai becomes the catalyst of the story,
even though she doesn’t even do anything.

297
00:16:57,830 --> 00:17:02,340
Everything starts
when a group of teens go partying,

298
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:07,450
and when everyone wakes up again,
Puifai is already dead.

299
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,890
Chaos then follows as everyone
keeps throwing the blame around.

300
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:14,550
When one person dies,

301
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:17,750
there must be at least one killer
among them, right?

302
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:18,550
From the autopsy—

303
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,740
I’m not sure how much the series reveals—

304
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:25,620
but it isn’t a sudden collapse
or a natural death.

305
00:17:25,650 --> 00:17:29,160
So it must be someone’s doing,
and Puifai is the victim.

306
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:34,700
I play Champ in this series.
CHIMON WACHIRAWIT AS CHAMP

307
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:35,830
For this character,

308
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:38,810
first of all,
he’s the son of a politician,

309
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:43,580
so of course he has influence
and a strong backing.

310
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:50,550
Personality-wise,
he’s a playboy and selfish.

311
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,150
He just does whatever comes to mind.

312
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,650
He doesn’t overthink.

313
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:05,260
Champ is a rich kid with lots of friends
because he has money.

314
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:10,450
He’s the alpha of the group, the top dog.

315
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:16,230
He has a girlfriend within the group,
and he has a strong playboy vibe.

316
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,290
Whatever he says, everyone listens

317
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,640
because he holds influence.

318
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:23,360
He’s good-looking and loud.

319
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,500
His family is rich.

320
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:29,650
He’s the one who leads
the others to party,

321
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,900
to break rules,
and stay above everyone else.

322
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,860
From Puifai’s perspective,

323
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:39,940
Champ is a caring, attentive,
and generous man.

324
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,430
They’ve been together for a while.

325
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:46,300
He always takes care of her,
drives her around,

326
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,850
and since they’re in
the same group of friends,

327
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,250
he constantly takes care of her.

328
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:53,910
Champ has a taciturn vibe, very composed.

329
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,490
When we’re in a scene together,

330
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,050
everyone else was
clinking glasses or dancing,

331
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,460
but he just sat there
with his arms crossed,

332
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,720
wearing sunglasses.

333
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,550
We’re indoors, but he’s still
wearing sunglasses.

334
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,260
Talk to my lawyer.

335
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,650
No

336
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,600
Sit down.

337
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,330
Playing Champ is quite challenging for me

338
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:17,750
because I’ve never played
the son of an MP or a politician before.

339
00:19:18,060 --> 00:19:23,250
So I did my homework by researching
how politicians carry themselves,

340
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:24,280
how they speak,

341
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,350
how they look at others,

342
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:27,750
and how they physically act.

343
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:31,450
It was actually a fun character study.

344
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:40,980
Cherreen is one of the university friends
JUNE WANWIMOL AS CHERREEN

345
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:44,980
involved in the incident.
JUNE WANWIMOL AS CHERREEN

346
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:52,410
She’s innocent and never intends
to hurt anyone.

347
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,470
There are three girls in the group,

348
00:19:55,730 --> 00:19:57,760
and they’re all close.

349
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,500
They share everything, gossip together,
and care for one another.

350
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,770
Cherreen is one of
Puifai’s closest friends.

351
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,210
There are only three girls in the group,

352
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:14,550
and there are things
you can only tell another girl.

353
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:17,050
Cherreen is strong.

354
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:20,850
She speaks up for Puifai
in many situations.

355
00:20:21,210 --> 00:20:25,400
In the series, Cherreen is more feminine
than my character.

356
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,600
She’s sweet, but with a bit of spice.

357
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:31,420
Cherreen collects information and listens.

358
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:35,930
She doesn’t make a fuss
and she doesn’t gossip much.

359
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:39,050
She just goes “mm-hm, I see.”

360
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,350
Honestly, this series plays with
our emotions a lot.

361
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:48,510
Normally in series,
if there’s a dramatic scene,

362
00:20:48,530 --> 00:20:49,970
you just cry and it’s done.

363
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,950
But this one is heavy.

364
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,950
The whole story feels intense.

365
00:20:55,310 --> 00:20:58,970
I constantly had to center myself.

366
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,330
I had to really stay focused.

367
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:03,260
We did have fun on set,

368
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:05,170
but I always had to pull myself back

369
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:10,350
because some scenes were extremely intense
and genuinely exhausting to act through.

370
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:28,380
DARE YOU TO DEATH SPECIAL: FILE UNLOCKED

371
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,630
I play as Time,
PROM TEEPAKRON AS TIME.

372
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:37,420
an engineering student.
PROM TEEPAKRON AS TIME.

373
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,780
Time’s character?

374
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,060
He’s probably a kid who likes to party.

375
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:42,170
His family is kind of rich.

376
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,940
And he has his own dark side.

377
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,810
I think you have to watch the series

378
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,100
to find out what is there
in Time’s dark side.

379
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,610
Time…
OHM THIPAKORN AS JAY.

380
00:21:49,610 --> 00:21:50,870
OHM THIPAKORN AS JAY.

381
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:52,410
likes to act cool.
OHM THIPAKORN AS JAY.

382
00:21:52,430 --> 00:21:54,910
He’s a little similar to Champ.

383
00:21:54,950 --> 00:21:56,190
As in, he’s a bit of a Playboy.

384
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,440
He’s kind of the head of the group.

385
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,590
He’s loud, he’s a player
and doesn’t think too deeply.

386
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:04,290
Time is fun.

387
00:22:05,370 --> 00:22:07,640
I wouldn’t say
he’s the joker of the group.

388
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,710
But if you see Time when he parties,
you would see that

389
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:11,310
he’s the one who sets up everything.

390
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,320
Choosing the songs.

391
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,160
Building up the mood.

392
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:15,030
He’s like the one who lights up
the mood of the group.

393
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,520
And bring laughter to the group.

394
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,510
Time is like…

395
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,010
A party boy.

396
00:22:20,110 --> 00:22:22,720
He’s the boy from a rich family.

397
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:25,150
He’d be like, “Hey, let’s party!”

398
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,110
And pour the liquor for the friends.

399
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,010
Something like that.

400
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,880
The difficult part about Time?

401
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:33,970
Some parts are unfamiliar to me.

402
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:37,820
I had to do some additional research

403
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:41,120
about how to feel the way
the character Time does.

404
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,810
What do I have to do to feel that way?

405
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:44,820
I mostly watched series more

406
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,250
to see what kinds of scenes
I have to encounter

407
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,610
and what kinds of emotions
I have to encounter.

408
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:52,890
This character is another spicy one.

409
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,320
The spice of the men’s side, I’d say.

410
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:58,110
The girls have Cherreen,
while the boys have Time.

411
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,980
I play Tar.
AUNGPAO OCHIRIS AS TAR.

412
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:07,130
Tar is part of the Avengers gang.

413
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,520
He’s kind of like the tutor.

414
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:11,900
He looks like a nerd
but that’s actually just a facade.

415
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,050
Tar is a nerd.

416
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:16,010
Very nerdy.

417
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:19,910
But is he really a nerd?

418
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,010
I don’t know.

419
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,340
Tar is the introvert.

420
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:25,310
He’s an introvert who doesn’t talk.

421
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,110
He always has something
he likes with him.

422
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,320
Tar is reserved.

423
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,730
He’s in my group,
but we don’t usually talk

424
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,000
because he’d have his personal space.

425
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:40,910
He has his private life and his hobby.

426
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:44,260
You have to find out in the series
what he’d be doing when he’s alone.

427
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:45,810
I’m glad!

428
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,610
I was so happy when I realized
I got to play Tar.

429
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,610
I’ve always wanted to try the role that’s…

430
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:55,500
I wouldn’t say he’s a villain
but he’s not a good guy.

431
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:58,350
I’ve never played
this kind of role before.

432
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,660
It’s very new and challenging.

433
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,550
I like it.

434
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,460
I play Tonkla.
ASHI PEERAKAN AS TONKLA.

435
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:14,250
Tonkla is daring and a little cheeky.

436
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:18,460
He likes to provoke
and doesn’t really like the police.

437
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:19,550
Tonkla?

438
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:25,210
He’s probably someone with
the most stories to tell the group.

439
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:28,240
He’s also one of the leaders
when it comes to partying.

440
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:32,260
When it comes to pouring drinks
or making a toast,

441
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,610
it would always be Tonkla.

442
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,100
He’s the most energetic one in the group.
EARN PREEYAPHAT AS BELL.

443
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:39,100
He’s like the entertainer of the group.
EARN PREEYAPHAT AS BELL.

444
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,860
Tonkla really loves his friends.

445
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,310
He’s down for whatever his friends say.

446
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,570
If his friends have something,
he has to have it too.

447
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:46,650
He’s fine as long as his friends are there

448
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,660
because his friends are
his comfort zone most of the time.

449
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,150
Judging from Jay’s perspective,

450
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,810
Tonkla is yearning for something.

451
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:55,910
That’s what Jay thinks.

452
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:59,950
For me, playing Tonkla is quite hard

453
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,900
because Tonkla’s character is
pretty far from who I am.

454
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:10,400
Since Tonkla is a tough guy, fierce,
and kind of like a gangster,

455
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,310
when I had a fitting session
with the director,

456
00:25:13,350 --> 00:25:15,910
he said I looked like a little boy.

457
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:21,010
My gaze and stuff seemed like a boy
so I worked extra on that part.

458
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:29,040
I play Bell, a girl from
the faculty of engineering,

459
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,510
part of the Avengers gang.

460
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:33,990
Bell’s character is a daring girl.

461
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:37,430
She’s the one in the group
who would start a fight again.

462
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:38,410
I mean,

463
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:42,670
she seems to have
a sharp mouth on the outside

464
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:45,010
but deep down she’s…

465
00:25:45,490 --> 00:25:46,240
kind of nice?

466
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,620
Puifai is really close to Bel
because she’s also the girl in the gang.

467
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:57,710
Bell is sassy but also cool and daring.

468
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:02,110
She kind of gets Puifai
to try on more things.

469
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:05,100
She brings color
and life to the character.

470
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,630
Within the group, she’s probably
the “dangerous one”.

471
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,560
That girl who’d fight people
in the school’s toilet.

472
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,320
If any friend has a problem,
she’d jump right in.

473
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,700
She would stand up for them.

474
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:20,390
I think my character this time is similar
to that in High School Frenemy.

475
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,590
A daring girl, the one
who throws the first punch.

476
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,840
But I try to design it so that Bell’s
character would be a little more girly.

477
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,330
More feminine and stuff.

478
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,950
I just wanted to help my friend,

479
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:36,310
so I called the ambulance first.

480
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,960
I have to tell you,
DUNK NATACHAI AS KAMIN.

481
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,460
for the Avengers gang,
DUNK NATACHAI AS KAMIN.

482
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,850
I only have good things to say about them.

483
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,540
Really.

484
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:45,210
Because they’re a group of
really good people.

485
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:47,770
From what I see– Wow!

486
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,310
Each character is so far
from home for them.

487
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,810
I have to give them the credits.

488
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,870
Because without them, there would be
no Dare You To Death.

489
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:57,410
Without them, we wouldn’t have
anything to investigate

490
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:58,610
apart from investigating ourselves.

491
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,360
I’m Tankhun.

492
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,510
And you are…?

493
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:03,710
I’m Inspector Kamin.

494
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,910
Could I have your LINE ID, please?

495
00:27:07,830 --> 00:27:10,360
I was worried you’d be tired,
so I brought you some food.

496
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:14,910
What’s your problem with Dr. Tankhun?

497
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,480
I just don’t like people who aren’t clear.

498
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,030
He’s mad at me again.

499
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:23,910
I’m often seen in the same scenes with
Dr. Tankhun and Dr. Puth.

500
00:27:24,790 --> 00:27:27,050
These two are workaholics.

501
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:32,150
First off, FlukeJee is Dr. Tankhun

502
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,950
and Dr. Puth is P’Sing.

503
00:27:34,790 --> 00:27:37,210
Their characters are very different,
even though they’re both doctors.

504
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:39,030
One would be very playful.

505
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,060
FlukeJee is the doctor
who lights up the scene.

506
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,490
While P’Sing’s like, the forensic doctor

507
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:48,370
who’s intimidating, cool,
and full of information.

508
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,010
I play Dr. Puth.
SING HARIT AS PUTH.

509
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:57,020
I’m a forensic doctor, so I do autopsies.
SING HARIT AS PUTH.

510
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,800
He’s actually serious.

511
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,290
He puts his mind into his work.

512
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,980
His partners are Inspector Kamin
and Captain Jet.

513
00:28:06,010 --> 00:28:10,050
We’d help each other investigate
who the murderer was.

514
00:28:10,550 --> 00:28:13,310
This is actually my third time
playing as a doctor.

515
00:28:13,390 --> 00:28:14,110
I’m also baffled.

516
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,610
Do I look smart?

517
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:18,270
Alright, it’s good.

518
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,210
Maybe I look mature.

519
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:25,180
And maybe that can convince the audience.

520
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:25,870
Maybe?

521
00:28:26,390 --> 00:28:29,850
Dr. Puth’s role is in the forensic part.

522
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:32,410
So he does autopsies.

523
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,030
When there’s a dead body,

524
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:37,360
I’d have to help the police investigate

525
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:40,950
to find out if there’s any
foreign substance in the dead body.

526
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,320
What was the method of murder?

527
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,510
It’s the department
that deals with the police.

528
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:51,010
So in the series,
there are many things that…

529
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,260
are linking or in sync.

530
00:28:53,290 --> 00:28:55,320
So stay tuned and let’s find out together.

531
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,410
I think the tough part of
this character was probably

532
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:02,810
the dialogue, which had lots of jargon.

533
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:06,580
The substances that are related
to one another.

534
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,510
The substance that’s present
in the dead body.

535
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:12,610
So it’s mostly about
the types of substances.

536
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:13,570
The script.

537
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,970
I’ve cooperated with
the special investigation team,

538
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,660
the pub we broke into had the substance
used in this serial murder.

539
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:26,060
P’Sammy plays as my subordinate.

540
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:30,560
Sammy’s character is my left hand.

541
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:33,090
Whatever I want or if there’s
any case that comes up,

542
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,100
P’Sammy would be the one
who solves it for me.

543
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:40,830
But P’Sammy’s character is very serious.

544
00:29:40,850 --> 00:29:42,210
She’s always stressed out,

545
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,640
which is totally in contrast
with her real character.

546
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:49,850
Since she plays a police officer,
she had to say very serious lines.

547
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:57,680
P’Sammy in my head is that
she’s really good at playing comedy.

548
00:29:57,970 --> 00:29:59,490
So when she has to play a serious role,

549
00:29:59,510 --> 00:30:02,630
I would sometimes slip out
a laugh in the scenes.

550
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:07,720
Every time I have a scene with P’Sammy,

551
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:11,010
I would wake up in the morning
and check the breakdown.

552
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,140
Kamin and Mirin.

553
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,310
Oh boy.

554
00:30:13,570 --> 00:30:14,080
I’d be stressed out.

555
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,160
I’d be stressed out for the day.

556
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:17,460
To look at each other and not laugh?

557
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,260
This is it, this is the super hard part.

558
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:23,450
There was a scene we had together,
I didn’t dare look at P’Sammy’s face.

559
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,980
It’s actually a scene of us talking

560
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:28,010
but the camera would shoot
from different angles.

561
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,910
Dunk didn’t dare look at P’Sammy

562
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:32,210
because he’d end up laughing.

563
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,190
I didn’t look at P’Fluke either

564
00:30:33,230 --> 00:30:35,060
because P’Fluke would laugh
if he looked at P’Sammy.

565
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:36,040
Everyone would laugh.

566
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,800
Everyone in that room.

567
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:40,610
Lucky for me that I was holding
a file in that scene.

568
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,270
So I just read the file,
not paying attention.

569
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,920
You guys can keep doing the dialogue.

570
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:46,910
I’ll be reading the file.

571
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:50,210
Dunk didn’t have a focus point, you know?

572
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:51,720
So he was reading the file with me.

573
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:54,630
Let’s skim through and
go to the more serious page

574
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,610
so we would actually be reading
and wouldn’t laugh.

575
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,130
It took us 3-4 takes
to get that scene done.

576
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,300
It was tough.

577
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,190
So hard.

578
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,370
I was stressed out, actually.

579
00:31:17,590 --> 00:31:20,840
DARE YOU TO DEATH SPECIAL: FILE UNLOCKED

580
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,200
The tough part about this series?

581
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:30,490
There were actually a lot of obstacles
during the shooting

582
00:31:30,810 --> 00:31:33,030
because we were shooting
when it was raining a lot.

583
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,640
When it rained, sometimes we had to
take 1-2 hours break.

584
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:38,670
Not to mention the lighting.
DUNK NATACHAI AS KAMIN.

585
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,610
The problems with the surroundings.
DUNK NATACHAI AS KAMIN.

586
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:42,080
The sound.
DUNK NATACHAI AS KAMIN.

587
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,780
Mosquitoes.

588
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,230
There were lots of mosquitoes
at the production.

589
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,850
It’s like we drew the mosquitoes in.

590
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,030
And you know what they say
about Thai mosquitoes.

591
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:54,920
They can bite through
your pants or your shoes.

592
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:56,680
They’re capable of anything.

593
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:59,020
Here, I’ve got
so many souvenirs from them.

594
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,830
The Thai mosquitoes are so good.

595
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,180
The ones in Turkey couldn’t even bite in.

596
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,530
They bit through my shoes!

597
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:07,230
My shoes were leather shoes!

598
00:32:07,390 --> 00:32:09,850
I don’t get how they could get inside.

599
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,530
To my leg inside.

600
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,320
They were able to get in and bite me.

601
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:16,830
-Or did they get through the pants?
-Like they bite through the pants.

602
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:17,350
Yeah.

603
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,520
It’s jeans, but they could bite through!

604
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,350
There were a lot of mosquitoes.

605
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,440
Even after spraying the repellent,
they were still circling me.

606
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,630
The hardest part was that

607
00:32:26,790 --> 00:32:29,830
I had to play in a scene
where I had to sit still

608
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,630
but I knew the mosquitoes
were flying around me.

609
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:36,910
I couldn’t move my hand,
that was such torture.

610
00:32:36,970 --> 00:32:38,370
But I couldn’t do anything about it.

611
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:41,730
It’s my job, so I had to hang in there.

612
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,720
It was also challenging
because of the location.

613
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:47,640
We were in an abandoned farm
or warehouse.

614
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:51,190
We had action scenes in the sun.

615
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,490
On a hot floor.

616
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,880
We had to do our best.

617
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:59,580
Whether it’s kicking,
punching, or shooting.

618
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,830
We definitely gave it our all.

619
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,590
It was quite adventurous

620
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:06,130
both because of
the location and the script.

621
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,490
We had to shoot at the locations
with lots of dust.

622
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,730
Everyone had to press on.

623
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,240
We were supporting each other.
It was really hot.

624
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,270
Both for the crews and the cast members.

625
00:33:14,290 --> 00:33:14,800
We had to press on.

626
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,220
Sometimes there were emotional scenes,
and there were effects and all things.

627
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,630
We had to press on.

628
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:28,140
We had to shoot at an abandoned warehouse
or like, storage rooms.

629
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,980
Which felt… itchy.

630
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:32,030
Because of the dust.

631
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,890
Itchy because of the dust!

632
00:33:43,170 --> 00:33:46,330
Since there were so many
characters in the series,

633
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:51,900
I felt like the characters had to
sync in the scene

634
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,640
so it would give out
the chemistry overall.

635
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,590
I feel like it was easy to work
at this production.

636
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:59,960
They didn’t make me feel
stressed or pressured while working

637
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:04,660
because everyone has their roles and
they’re doing their best on their parts.

638
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,830
I got the energy from the production
which helped cheer me up.

639
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,770
They weren’t saying things or scolding me,
or pressuring me.

640
00:34:11,810 --> 00:34:13,730
Instead, they were helping me.

641
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,150
I think it was good teamwork.

642
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:19,380
Where everyone had the same agenda
which was to get the job done quickly

643
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,630
and get the best results.

644
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:21,580
It was so much fun.

645
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:23,730
It was chaotic at the production.

646
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:25,430
Everyone couldn’t stop teasing each other.

647
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,880
P’Prom was funny, P’Ohm was funny.

648
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:31,030
Everyone almost couldn’t
hold their laughter.

649
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,830
Oh, one more thing, at this production,

650
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:35,280
everyone enjoyed eating the props.

651
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,860
It’s so nice.

652
00:34:36,950 --> 00:34:37,480
Look.

653
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,530
Even the food in the scene tastes good.

654
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:42,360
Since it was a party,

655
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:45,520
there were snacks laid out
at the production.

656
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:49,030
Fried chicken, drinks, teas, and stuff.

657
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,010
Everyone was eating like, so much.

658
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,300
So much so that we were out of voice.

659
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:57,330
There was a scene
where P’Earn had to scream

660
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:01,210
but she ate so many snacks
that she lost her voice.

661
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,330
When she screamed,
it was a cracked scream.

662
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:05,340
An out-of-key scream.

663
00:35:06,010 --> 00:35:09,890
The vibe was so lovely
and also very chaotic.

664
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:12,630
It was like we were in the middle of–

665
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,580
I’m also young, so it was like
kids playing around.

666
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,870
I was happy, though.

667
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,470
It felt like being surrounded
by lots of friends.

668
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:22,330
Like I get positive energy
when I come to the production.

669
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:27,380
We would enjoy the breaks, meal time,
when we’d come together and talk.

670
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:31,700
Or if anyone was free with no shooting,
we would just be making TikToks.

671
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,930
Just for fun to post on our social media.

672
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:37,860
Actually, this production is
one of those I love dearly.

673
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:41,060
Because everyone was so nice.

674
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,890
From the casts, to the directors,
and all the crews.

675
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,630
They treated me so well.

676
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,720
It was such a great memory.

677
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:52,050
Also, the Joong-Dunk fans,

678
00:35:52,070 --> 00:35:56,030
they would be hyping me up
when I go to the production.

679
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,530
They would also send food support

680
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:03,330
enough for the other cast members
to share also.

681
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,790
So I’m very grateful.

682
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:07,740
Thank you so much to the fans
from all fandoms

683
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,230
for supporting me in this series.

684
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:20,260
The crew and the director
of this production were all nice.

685
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:24,390
He would tell me
how he would like it to be.

686
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,130
Like, do a spare for this one.

687
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:29,240
What should the mood be like?
Just as I’ve mentioned earlier.

688
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,960
Everyone was so supportive
and hold as a teamwork.

689
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:37,130
So that we could get through each scene.

690
00:36:37,210 --> 00:36:40,170
That was very supportive.

691
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,530
The director is P’Dome.

692
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:47,430
Since the script was pretty intense,
as it’s about investigations and stuff,

693
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:50,590
P’Dome would often crack jokes.

694
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,930
He didn’t want the vibe to be too serious.

695
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:55,870
He would come in and crack jokes

696
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,390
that even the cast didn’t want
to hear it sometimes.

697
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,130
Just kidding.

698
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,320
P’Dome was nice.

699
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,930
He did his research well
and offers great consultations.

700
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:06,870
It was my first time working with P’Dome.

701
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,120
P’Dome was kind of
half-joking and half-serious.

702
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:13,930
Say, we’re having a conversation,

703
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,710
let’s say I already did one take

704
00:37:15,770 --> 00:37:18,490
and you want to know if you should
put in more or tone it down,

705
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,430
P’Dome would say it seriously

706
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,940
then end with a joke
that he wants it this way.

707
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,060
Let’s say, he goes

708
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:27,020
“After acting,
look at the camera and smile.”

709
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,430
“Then with a clap, jump and spin around,
summersault– Boom!”

710
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:32,070
Sometimes when he said that,

711
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:34,730
I didn’t know if that’s really
what he wanted

712
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,210
or if he was just joking.

713
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:39,430
Some fun splash to it.

714
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,140
Yes.

715
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,300
It was my first time working with P’Dome.

716
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,680
Since I’m very serious with my work,
I was like,

717
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:47,510
“P’Dome, where do I have to
stand for this one?”

718
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:50,290
“What’s your vision of this?”

719
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,860
I thought he was going to be
serious and intimidating

720
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,630
because he had
his brows all furrowed at first.

721
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,530
But then he walked over, smiled at me,
then pull out the drawer.

722
00:37:58,490 --> 00:37:59,430
“Pop up from here.”

723
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,530
I was like, “Huh?”

724
00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:02,780
“You’ve never seen Doraemon?”

725
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,790
“Pardon me?”

726
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,150
P’Dome was such a nice director.

727
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:09,110
While working with him,
I didn’t feel stressed at all.

728
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:13,130
He would always cheer me up
and always had a solution for me.

729
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:15,230
Working with him was not stressful at all.

730
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:28,510
This series is a new style of series
from GMMTV.

731
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:31,160
It’s not something that’s made often.

732
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:36,730
I think I have seen a lot of the series
from my agency.

733
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:39,010
But I don’t often see this style.

734
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:43,450
I also believe a lot of the fans
are probably into this style.

735
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:45,040
Please stay tuned.

736
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:49,140
I’ll say, every character
has their secrets.

737
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,610
Every single one of them.

738
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:54,330
And they have something that’s waiting
for you to unravel.

739
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:58,000
You have to stay tuned to find out
what their secrets are

740
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,350
and how they will be revealed.

741
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:04,470
This series is Joong-Dunk’s
first detective series.

742
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:06,900
It’s something new for us

743
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:10,030
and I believe it will be something new
for the audience too.

744
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:13,230
Also, for all the actors
playing in this series

745
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,630
who were taking on quite tough roles.

746
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,380
I hope you will tune in
to find out how they’ll play it out.

747
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,080
With such an intense script,
can all of us hit that bar?

748
00:39:22,100 --> 00:39:24,590
And how fun will the story be?

749
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:27,150
I’m telling you,
it has so many emotions in it.

750
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:33,140
Exciting, fun, thrilling, and even horror.

751
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,360
I’d love for you all to see it.

752
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,230
Everyone will definitely get
something new from Joong and Dunk.

753
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,930
This series is really more serious.

754
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:44,390
It’s more mature, more grown up.

755
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:49,570
But in the midst of the intense story,
and the serious tone,

756
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:53,330
there is romance hidden in there
in every episode of the series.

757
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:54,680
In addition to that,

758
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,130
I’d say you will get to reflect along
with each character.

759
00:40:01,150 --> 00:40:06,120
because each character has different
personalities and backgrounds.

760
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,630
You will get to understand
each of their lives.

761
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:18,260
Each case can be related to social issues
or things that are still there in society.

762
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,930
You will probably be able to relate to it.

763
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:23,250
You will probably get a lot of takeaways
from this series.

764
00:40:23,290 --> 00:40:27,770
I think the team did well
on the special effect.

765
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:34,330
Since this story is quite “extreme”
as in, when the character is to… Ack!

766
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,860
Or when something happens
to the character,

767
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:39,560
the effect was nicely done.

768
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:42,830
It was so real that I dreamt about it.

769
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:49,400
There was a scene with someone dying
and the body was lying in front of me.

770
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,280
I was like, “Our art team is so good!”

771
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,450
It looked like an actual person.

772
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:58,030
You just have to cover the face
and you’d think that’s a real dead body.

773
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:03,640
I think it was something interesting,
for the artwork for the shooting.

774
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:06,870
Where would you be able to see
a murder being solved

775
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:09,980
by just a game, which is Truth or Dare.

776
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:13,130
There’s also the issue
of the relationship.

777
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,630
As I said, each character
has their issues.

778
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,890
They have their own sins.

779
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:22,760
So you really can’t miss
<i>Dare You To Death</i>.

780
00:41:22,830 --> 00:41:23,630
I hope you will open up to it.

781
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,180
It’s actually not that hard to digest.

782
00:41:25,230 --> 00:41:28,280
The team, the director,
and the script writer

783
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:32,750
were trying to portray it in the way that
it’s easy to enjoy but still fun.

784
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:33,630
Don’t miss it!

785
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,030
You will get the swoon, the thrilling,

786
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:38,750
the exciting, and the drama.

787
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,430
Oh? That’s all the flavors right there!

788
00:41:40,730 --> 00:41:44,380
I hope you will root for
all the characters.

789
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:47,630
You keep working like a robot.

790
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:49,240
Ever heard of resting?

791
00:41:49,570 --> 00:41:50,440
Criminals don’t rest,

792
00:41:50,730 --> 00:41:51,830
so how can the police rest?

793
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:54,130
Even a 5-star hotel like this

794
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:56,430
still can’t make you sleep well,
Inspector?

795
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,630
In that case, I think we need to
find you a new place to stay.

796
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,530
Will there be a lot of people?

797
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,030
Are you kidding me?

798
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:02,330
You brought me to your house?

799
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,690
Welcome, welcome.

800
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,150
I’m Joong.

801
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:12,070
Please support the character,
Captain Jet.

802
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:14,030
Everyone in this series,

803
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:17,210
including the director,
the cast, and all the staff,

804
00:42:17,270 --> 00:42:18,630
really put their hearts into it.

805
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,980
There are also many other actors

806
00:42:21,030 --> 00:42:23,510
who will surprise you
with a cameo in this series.

807
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:27,100
Please adore Kamin.

808
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,940
This Inspector Kamin is no ordinary.

809
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,050
It’s another image from me.

810
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,650
Please support Kamin.

811
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:36,630
He’s definitely super cool.

812
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,580
Super handsome.

813
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,750
Please support Jay.

814
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,030
I hope you will tune in because

815
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:47,400
it was my first time playing
such a tough and intense role.

816
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:51,180
I hope you will tune in
to see how well I did.

817
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,580
Hoping to hear feedback from you all.

818
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:56,300
Please support Puifai.

819
00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:00,120
I believe she’d be the character
that many of you might fall for

820
00:43:00,150 --> 00:43:01,990
or maybe feel sorry for? I don’t know!

821
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,970
I really put my heart into
portraying this character.

822
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,440
I did a lot of extra work,

823
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:13,830
and tried to find the most realistic
and relatable background.

824
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:18,580
It’s another character
that’s a big switch of role for me.

825
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:19,830
But how will I “switch”?

826
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:22,630
Please stay tuned until the end.

827
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:27,130
As Champ, I hope you will support
<i>Dare You To Death</i>.

828
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,840
Champ is a very interesting character.

829
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:34,580
In addition to Champ,
there are still so many characters.

830
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:37,380
Really, a lot more for you to stay tuned.

831
00:43:37,430 --> 00:43:40,120
All the cast really put their all
into every character.

832
00:43:40,310 --> 00:43:43,080
Please support Cherreen.

833
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,930
It’s another character that
I poured my heart into.

834
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:49,530
I’m proud to get to play this role.

835
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:53,490
I put my heart into every scene.

836
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:59,430
I hope you will stay tuned
and root for the staff and the cast.

837
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:06,090
And please hype us up
when the series goes on air.

838
00:44:06,130 --> 00:44:08,830
Please share and spread the word.

839
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,250
Please support Time.

840
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:12,840
He’s the character where I get
to try a new role.

841
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,270
I hope you will tune in
to find out how it goes.

842
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:19,120
I’m very excited and gave Time my all.

843
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:20,930
Please tune in.

844
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:22,880
Please support Tar.

845
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,710
I put my heart into this character.

846
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:27,970
I did a lot of extra work
and worked on it a lot.

847
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,120
Please support.

848
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:31,410
Please support Bell.

849
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:36,030
It was a challenging character
and I put my heart into this role.

850
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:40,230
Please adore Bell and all the characters.

851
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:44,160
All the cast and staff
gave this series their all.

852

Please support Tonkla.

853
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:50,730
I did quite a lot of extra work on Tonkla
and put my heart into this series.

854
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:57,330
I hope you will love and stay tuned to
<i>Dare You To Death.</i>

855
00:44:58,010 --> 00:45:03,020
Joong and Dunk hope you will support
<i>Dare You To Death.</i>

00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:17,990
Why are you so full of yourself?!
