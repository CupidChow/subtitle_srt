1
00:00:02,345 --> 00:00:03,865
- Shit!
<i>- I don't even know</i>

2
00:00:03,945 --> 00:00:05,105
<i>if I'll be the next corpse!</i>

3
00:00:05,185 --> 00:00:07,145
<i>Did Bell and Cherreen have</i>
<i>any problems with each other?</i>

4
00:00:07,225 --> 00:00:09,265
Cherreen was the only one
who had a key card to Bell's room.

5
00:00:09,345 --> 00:00:12,505
<i>Someone must have received a letter</i>
<i>and hasn't told us yet.</i>

6
00:00:12,585 --> 00:00:14,585
<i>And that person could be Tonkla.</i>

7
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:16,825
Hey!

8
00:00:17,425 --> 00:00:18,305
Hello?

9
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:24,665
<i>Have you ever heard that</i>
<i>curiosity kills the cat?</i>

10
00:00:24,745 --> 00:00:25,865
What do you mean by that?

11
00:00:25,945 --> 00:00:27,345
Hey!

12
00:00:28,545 --> 00:00:29,745
Jade!

13
00:00:54,785 --> 00:00:59,305
<i>Do you like my welcome gift,</i>

14
00:00:59,385 --> 00:01:01,385
<i>Inspector Kamin?</i>

15
00:01:54,345 --> 00:01:55,865
Do you know The Wild Hunt?

16
00:01:57,025 --> 00:02:00,345
This is where Jade got attacked
when he was investigating the case.

17
00:02:00,425 --> 00:02:02,705
This club is hardcore as hell.

18
00:02:02,785 --> 00:02:04,265
I've been there two or three times.

19
00:02:04,345 --> 00:02:09,225
It's where rich high-society types
come to do drugs.

20
00:02:14,305 --> 00:02:15,865
But I never did drugs.

21
00:02:18,305 --> 00:02:19,225
Good.

22
00:02:21,625 --> 00:02:23,785
So Jade was attacked
by people from The Wild Hunt?

23
00:02:29,345 --> 00:02:30,545
Yes.

24
00:02:37,465 --> 00:02:38,785
If you're worried,

25
00:02:38,865 --> 00:02:40,385
tell him when he comes to.

26
00:02:41,105 --> 00:02:42,185
No way.

27
00:02:42,825 --> 00:02:44,665
I'd rather bite my tongue and die.

28
00:02:47,785 --> 00:02:49,345
I'll go downstairs
to get something to eat.

29
00:02:59,185 --> 00:03:00,145
Kamin.

30
00:03:01,225 --> 00:03:02,465
Are you okay?

31
00:03:03,705 --> 00:03:05,065
Where does it hurt?

32
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:06,385
It hurts.

33
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:16,825
It hurts right here.

34
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:22,545
If you still have the energy to talk back,

35
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:23,905
you must be fine.

36
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:26,945
I'm leaving.

37
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:28,545
Hey!

38
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,065
You're really going to leave
an injured person like this?

39
00:03:39,065 --> 00:03:40,145
Drama queen.

40
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:45,825
Hey, stay with me.

41
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:49,665
Stay with me, will you?

42
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,305
This kiss means I'm worried.

43
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:31,385
Just worried?

44
00:04:33,225 --> 00:04:37,105
I already told you yesterday
to take care of yourself.

45
00:04:37,185 --> 00:04:38,745
Look at you now.

46
00:04:41,185 --> 00:04:42,785
You're so strict, huh?

47
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,305
Don't get hurt again, okay?

48
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:51,305
When I say I'm worried,

49
00:04:53,105 --> 00:04:55,105
I don't say it to just anyone.

50
00:04:56,785 --> 00:04:58,265
And every time I say it,

51
00:04:59,985 --> 00:05:01,825
I really mean it.

52
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:07,905
Seon Jae is moving faster
than we expected.

53
00:05:08,945 --> 00:05:11,905
He probably knows we're onto him.

54
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:15,545
But Captain Jade was ambushed.

55
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:16,705
We need to move fast.

56
00:05:16,785 --> 00:05:18,145
Seeing you this tense,

57
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:21,025
I can't tell whether you're worried that
Seon Jae is ahead of us,

58
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:22,825
or you're worried about Jade.

59
00:05:25,065 --> 00:05:27,345
I just don't want things
to end up like it did back then.

60
00:05:33,825 --> 00:05:36,545
This place isn't just about drugs.

61
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:39,505
They also run illegal boxing matches.

62
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:42,185
Any fighter who loses…

63
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:44,345
When you find them again, they're dead.

64
00:05:44,425 --> 00:05:47,785
This time, the Special Investigation Unit
will lead the operation.

65
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:50,625
And you're going in yourself?

66
00:05:50,705 --> 00:05:51,825
Not my team.

67
00:05:51,905 --> 00:05:54,985
The operation is led by Yu
from the Special Investigation Unit.

68
00:05:57,745 --> 00:05:59,265
Yu?

69
00:05:59,345 --> 00:06:02,825
I'm just curious
what a cop's daily life is like.

70
00:06:02,905 --> 00:06:03,785
Look at you.

71
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:06,465
You're working all day, every day.
I've never seen you date anyone.

72
00:06:06,545 --> 00:06:08,465
But wait. What about Yu?

73
00:06:09,505 --> 00:06:10,345
Are you two dating?

74
00:06:17,265 --> 00:06:18,305
<i>Yes.</i>

75
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:20,305
If you get information on
Lee Seon Jae of The Wild Hunt,

76
00:06:20,385 --> 00:06:21,745
please update me.

77
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:24,145
<i>Yes, Inspector.</i>

78
00:06:26,785 --> 00:06:28,505
Damn it, Jay.

79
00:06:28,585 --> 00:06:31,025
I told you I could shower by myself.

80
00:06:31,665 --> 00:06:33,705
If I don't wipe you down,
you won't shower at all.

81
00:06:33,785 --> 00:06:35,785
- There are nurses, you know.
- You're filthy as hell.

82
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:38,025
- You think I don't know that?
- Jay, have you eaten yet?

83
00:06:38,105 --> 00:06:39,585
Not yet.

84
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:41,505
I'll take care of Jade then.

85
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:45,425
Okay. I'll leave him to you.

86
00:06:58,545 --> 00:07:00,145
You know how to do this, right?

87
00:07:03,145 --> 00:07:04,425
Trust me.

88
00:07:08,785 --> 00:07:10,065
You can press harder.

89
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:13,065
It doesn't hurt.

90
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:18,625
The doctor said you can be discharged

91
00:07:19,225 --> 00:07:21,545
and go home in just two days.

92
00:07:21,625 --> 00:07:23,025
What?

93
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:24,505
Two days?

94
00:07:25,385 --> 00:07:27,585
Honestly, I'm already fine.

95
00:07:27,665 --> 00:07:29,945
- I can even go home today.
- Hey, come on.

96
00:07:31,425 --> 00:07:33,265
I'm not done wiping you yet.

97
00:07:36,865 --> 00:07:38,825
All right then.

98
00:07:56,665 --> 00:08:00,425
So, how far have you gotten on Seon Jae?

99
00:08:00,505 --> 00:08:04,585
I'm tracking him down.

100
00:08:05,465 --> 00:08:07,025
But don't worry.

101
00:08:07,105 --> 00:08:09,705
I'll take care of every charge for you,

102
00:08:09,785 --> 00:08:13,825
including drugs or assaulting an officer.

103
00:08:16,025 --> 00:08:18,025
Can you handle it alone?

104
00:08:18,105 --> 00:08:19,625
Of course.

105
00:08:21,425 --> 00:08:23,025
If I weren't good enough,

106
00:08:23,945 --> 00:08:25,505
I wouldn't be an inspector.

107
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:28,625
I'm not saying you're not good.

108
00:08:30,105 --> 00:08:31,945
I just want to work with you.

109
00:08:44,745 --> 00:08:46,585
Before we talk about the case,

110
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:49,825
can we talk about us first?

111
00:08:52,505 --> 00:08:56,665
What exactly are we?

112
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:01,585
I'm your superior.

113
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:02,945
You're my subordinate.

114
00:09:03,025 --> 00:09:05,985
What kind of superior
kisses their subordinate?

115
00:09:06,705 --> 00:09:08,065
Tell me.

116
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,465
Let's talk about this

117
00:09:11,545 --> 00:09:14,385
after the Seon Jae case is over, okay?

118
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:18,025
If you don't feel anything,

119
00:09:18,105 --> 00:09:19,865
just tell me straight,

120
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:22,745
so I know how to handle my feelings.

121
00:09:23,745 --> 00:09:25,065
Yeah.

122
00:09:36,865 --> 00:09:38,345
- Hey, Jay.
- Yeah?

123
00:09:38,425 --> 00:09:39,705
There'll be officers guarding you.

124
00:09:41,345 --> 00:09:43,185
No matter what,

125
00:09:43,265 --> 00:09:45,425
don't let anyone you don't know
come visit.

126
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:47,385
- Understand?
- Understood.

127
00:10:07,065 --> 00:10:09,065
You already signed?

128
00:10:09,145 --> 00:10:11,385
Didn't you say three more days?

129
00:10:12,705 --> 00:10:13,865
Are you taking it or not?

130
00:10:13,945 --> 00:10:15,265
Of course I am.

131
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:21,025
Then get some rest.

132
00:10:21,105 --> 00:10:22,665
All right. Goodbye.

133
00:10:23,185 --> 00:10:24,465
See you.

134
00:10:30,385 --> 00:10:31,785
Why the hell are you smiling?

135
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,265
Latte.

136
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:40,625
How did you know my usual is a latte?

137
00:10:43,705 --> 00:10:45,385
Kamin told me.

138
00:10:51,105 --> 00:10:52,625
Sweet, huh?

139
00:11:02,865 --> 00:11:04,545
Did you get called in too?

140
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:05,945
Yeah.

141
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:08,385
I was called in for questioning.

142
00:11:10,105 --> 00:11:14,185
Then why the hell are you here, Champ?

143
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:16,545
I came to keep her company.

144
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,065
She's scared.

145
00:11:21,585 --> 00:11:22,625
That smells like your perfume.

146
00:11:23,305 --> 00:11:25,025
Puifai just died.

147
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:26,665
Did you two already sleep together?

148
00:11:26,745 --> 00:11:28,585
Stop running your mouth.

149
00:11:28,665 --> 00:11:30,185
It's because you're like this.

150
00:11:30,265 --> 00:11:33,865
Except for me, Fai, and Cher,

151
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:35,665
no one wants you as a friend.

152
00:11:37,265 --> 00:11:39,585
Why do you always assume
the worst about me?

153
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:43,825
Don't you remember
I'm the one who always helped you?

154
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:46,545
Stop bringing up favors, asshole.
You're the worst piece of shit.

155
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:48,105
You want me to say it?

156
00:11:48,665 --> 00:11:52,425
I'm sick of watching
you play the victim too.

157
00:11:53,505 --> 00:11:56,745
Hey, can we not make this worse?

158
00:11:59,705 --> 00:12:01,465
Just go back first, Champ.

159
00:12:01,545 --> 00:12:02,865
I'll let you know when it's done.

160
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,025
This way, please.

161
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:07,105
Go already.

162
00:12:33,265 --> 00:12:34,265
<i>Hello.</i>

163
00:12:34,345 --> 00:12:37,825
Lieutenant said you called
Tonkla and Cherreen in for questioning.

164
00:12:37,905 --> 00:12:38,905
I'll be right there soon.

165
00:12:38,985 --> 00:12:40,985
<i>I told you to rest.</i>

166
00:12:41,065 --> 00:12:42,865
What part of that is so hard
to understand?

167
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,745
If I'm not there,
how are you going to pressure the kids?

168
00:12:46,345 --> 00:12:48,105
I've got solid evidence.

169
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,945
This gang is covering up a secret
of their friends.

170
00:12:53,025 --> 00:12:54,905
But I don't know
if they're doing it out of love,

171
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:56,465
or because they're involved themselves.

172
00:12:57,145 --> 00:13:00,905
Either way, we'll find out just
how much they love each other.

173
00:13:17,945 --> 00:13:21,105
What's your relationship with Tonkla?

174
00:13:21,705 --> 00:13:24,825
Well, we're just friends.

175
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,265
But from what I see,

176
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:31,985
the relationships between
Tonkla, Champ, and you are messy.

177
00:13:33,785 --> 00:13:35,585
Did Puifai know about this?

178
00:13:38,145 --> 00:13:41,025
Our friends have been dying one by one.

179
00:13:41,105 --> 00:13:43,345
Of course we're scared.

180
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:45,225
Who knows who'll be next?

181
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:47,465
I was just worried.

182
00:13:47,985 --> 00:13:49,145
I was afraid Cher might overthink things.

183
00:13:49,225 --> 00:13:50,625
You were worried about Cherreen?

184
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,545
But Bell's death didn't matter?

185
00:13:54,145 --> 00:13:56,425
Is this what an unequal friendship
looks like?

186
00:13:56,505 --> 00:13:58,305
How the hell was I supposed to know

187
00:13:59,105 --> 00:14:00,785
Bell would actually die?

188
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:05,785
You have a crush on Cherreen, don't you?

189
00:14:09,585 --> 00:14:11,025
How long has it been?

190
00:14:12,545 --> 00:14:14,345
<i>He's the one trying on his own.</i>

191
00:14:14,425 --> 00:14:16,305
I never led him on.

192
00:14:16,385 --> 00:14:19,425
Everyone in the group knows
we're just friends.

193
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:22,705
But you benefit from him liking you.

194
00:14:23,545 --> 00:14:25,985
You can use him to survive.

195
00:14:27,225 --> 00:14:29,705
I have to stay in touch
with him as a friend

196
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,905
because if I suddenly cut him off,

197
00:14:34,065 --> 00:14:36,185
he might completely lose it.

198
00:14:38,225 --> 00:14:39,825
And what about Champ?

199
00:14:46,785 --> 00:14:50,825
Which of your friends knows
you hooked up with him?

200
00:14:54,385 --> 00:14:55,905
This was even before Puifai died.

201
00:14:57,745 --> 00:14:59,745
Three people are dead now.

202
00:15:00,505 --> 00:15:03,705
Don't you ever think you could be next?

203
00:15:07,065 --> 00:15:10,345
Someone like you looks easy to pick on.

204
00:15:16,145 --> 00:15:18,385
I do feel guilty.

205
00:15:19,025 --> 00:15:22,985
But Champ threatened

206
00:15:23,065 --> 00:15:25,665
to kick me out of the group
if I didn't go along with it.

207
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:29,785
You know how much influence he has.

208
00:15:33,785 --> 00:15:35,705
Even if you help her survive,

209
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:38,065
she won't choose you.

210
00:15:40,025 --> 00:15:41,425
Just tell me already.

211
00:15:41,505 --> 00:15:43,865
What is your friend really like?

212
00:15:45,505 --> 00:15:47,185
- I don't know.
- Are you sure?

213
00:15:49,665 --> 00:15:51,905
- Do you know or not?
- I said I don't know, damn it!

214
00:16:08,465 --> 00:16:10,385
No one here is suspicious.

215
00:16:10,465 --> 00:16:11,865
We're all victims.

216
00:16:15,665 --> 00:16:16,585
What about this incident?

217
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,385
Were you still victims?

218
00:16:21,345 --> 00:16:23,065
What the f*ck does this shit
have to do with anything?

219
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:28,345
Whoever talks first survives.

220
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:31,665
So why did you all
help to cover this case up?

221
00:16:38,305 --> 00:16:40,225
Cherreen has nothing to do with this.

222
00:16:41,185 --> 00:16:43,225
This is on me.

223
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,985
But it's over already.

224
00:16:47,065 --> 00:16:48,825
Did you clear it?

225
00:16:50,225 --> 00:16:51,585
Or did Champ do it?

226
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:53,745
Champ's not involved.

227
00:16:58,865 --> 00:17:00,585
If I'm going to prison,

228
00:17:00,665 --> 00:17:02,785
that bastard's going with me.

229
00:17:03,385 --> 00:17:05,665
He helped me get rid of
the body that night.

230
00:17:07,665 --> 00:17:09,464
Someone like him has no heart.

231
00:17:09,545 --> 00:17:10,985
He's playing two women at once.

232
00:17:11,665 --> 00:17:13,065
One of them died,

233
00:17:13,825 --> 00:17:15,385
and he doesn't feel a damn thing.

234
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:22,585
If you're going to investigate us,
why don't you investigate Time instead?

235
00:17:23,704 --> 00:17:24,985
Cherreen.

236
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:27,224
Time?

237
00:17:28,865 --> 00:17:30,545
What's so interesting about him?

238
00:17:34,425 --> 00:17:37,065
Tonkla accidentally hitting someone once

239
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:39,305
doesn't even compare to the shit
Time does regularly.

240
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,785
If you're going to arrest someone,
at least get the right guy.

241
00:17:43,825 --> 00:17:47,705
That bastard secretly
records himself having sex

242
00:17:47,785 --> 00:17:49,265
and sells the clips.

243
00:17:52,065 --> 00:17:53,625
He doesn't even spare
his own friends in the group.

244
00:17:55,665 --> 00:17:57,785
But his dad's a cop,

245
00:17:58,465 --> 00:18:00,305
so no one can touch him.

246
00:18:08,065 --> 00:18:09,745
Inspector, there's a letter.

247
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:34,745
A dinner invitation?

248
00:18:36,025 --> 00:18:38,905
So tonight, you're really
walking straight into the lion's den,

249
00:18:38,985 --> 00:18:40,225
just like they invited you to?

250
00:18:42,105 --> 00:18:43,105
Yes.

251
00:18:43,905 --> 00:18:47,705
These people could be behind
the drug network tied to Tar.

252
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:52,345
This might include the illegal drugs
injected into Puifai's body.

253
00:18:54,105 --> 00:18:58,825
Mirin said ordinary people
can't buy those drugs.

254
00:19:00,025 --> 00:19:03,785
But if we go in, we'll see who buys them.

255
00:19:04,305 --> 00:19:06,465
We might even hit the jackpot
and find the killer.

256
00:19:09,145 --> 00:19:10,305
How can you be so sure?

257
00:19:11,345 --> 00:19:12,865
Isn't this too risky?

258
00:19:14,825 --> 00:19:17,105
I've been watching Seon Jae
for a long time.

259
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:21,625
You should focus on questioning the kids.

260
00:19:23,665 --> 00:19:25,145
Let me go with you.

261
00:19:27,665 --> 00:19:28,905
Hey.

262
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:31,945
How long are you going to make me
worry about you?

263
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,305
And have you ever thought that

264
00:19:35,065 --> 00:19:36,545
I worry about you too?

265
00:19:49,505 --> 00:19:50,865
Here you are.

266
00:19:54,825 --> 00:19:56,225
Your housewarming gift.

267
00:19:59,545 --> 00:20:01,145
Why a wolf?

268
00:20:02,185 --> 00:20:03,865
Isn't that your tattoo?

269
00:20:03,945 --> 00:20:07,225
Yeah. My tattoo.

270
00:20:07,825 --> 00:20:11,385
But wolves are arrogant, just like you.

271
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,985
Though honestly,
you don't really suit a wolf either.

272
00:20:16,585 --> 00:20:18,145
You're too stubborn.

273
00:20:18,225 --> 00:20:19,985
You're more like a house dog.

274
00:20:22,225 --> 00:20:23,745
Yeah, I'm very stubborn,

275
00:20:25,145 --> 00:20:26,745
especially when it comes to you.

276
00:20:29,785 --> 00:20:31,105
Trust me.

277
00:20:32,185 --> 00:20:33,825
I do trust you.

278
00:20:34,585 --> 00:20:36,025
But no matter what,

279
00:20:37,145 --> 00:20:39,585
I won't let you face this alone.

280
00:20:41,785 --> 00:20:44,505
You'll always have me.

281
00:20:56,385 --> 00:20:58,025
What do you think Puifai's secret is?

282
00:21:03,265 --> 00:21:05,545
Maybe…

283
00:21:05,625 --> 00:21:08,865
Puifai is actually
the worst one in the group.

284
00:21:08,945 --> 00:21:10,865
Or maybe…

285
00:21:12,785 --> 00:21:14,825
she's just a pitiful victim.

286
00:21:15,345 --> 00:21:19,905
But I don't believe anyone
is 100 percent innocent.

287
00:21:22,265 --> 00:21:24,185
Everyone has secrets.

288
00:21:33,905 --> 00:21:35,665
<i>I still haven't been able to accept it,</i>

289
00:21:35,745 --> 00:21:37,905
so I haven't packed anything yet.

290
00:21:39,025 --> 00:21:42,905
Feel free to look around, officers.

291
00:21:42,985 --> 00:21:45,345
I'll wait downstairs.

292
00:21:45,425 --> 00:21:46,785
Thank you.

293
00:22:31,385 --> 00:22:32,225
Hey.

294
00:22:39,945 --> 00:22:42,225
<i>Having shitty friends is like</i>
<i>being alive in hell.</i>

295
00:22:42,905 --> 00:22:44,625
<i>But why suffer alone?</i>

296
00:22:45,265 --> 00:22:48,505
<i>Try dying and you'll see</i>
<i>their true colors.</i>

297
00:22:49,225 --> 00:22:51,105
<i>Whether it's truth or dare,</i>

298
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:53,505
<i>they all have to die.</i>

299
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,745
That means Puifai was the first
to receive the letter.

300
00:22:59,265 --> 00:23:01,985
She was the beginning of everything.

301
00:23:02,065 --> 00:23:04,865
Suicide following the killer's invitation?

302
00:23:04,945 --> 00:23:06,865
But even if that's true,

303
00:23:08,385 --> 00:23:12,785
we still don't know who would want
Puifai and her friends dead.

304
00:23:13,465 --> 00:23:14,745
And we still don't know

305
00:23:16,825 --> 00:23:18,665
the exact order of the deaths.

306
00:23:25,425 --> 00:23:27,065
<i>Ever since that day,</i>

307
00:23:27,145 --> 00:23:29,505
I haven't gone into Fai's room.

308
00:23:29,585 --> 00:23:33,745
And I never knew anything
about the letter.

309
00:23:35,825 --> 00:23:37,705
Before all this happened,

310
00:23:37,785 --> 00:23:39,185
what was Puifai like?

311
00:23:39,265 --> 00:23:41,065
She was a good girl.

312
00:23:41,705 --> 00:23:43,145
Studious.

313
00:23:43,985 --> 00:23:46,665
Everyone said she was sweet.

314
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:48,625
But lately,

315
00:23:49,945 --> 00:23:53,465
she became quiet.

316
00:23:53,545 --> 00:23:57,545
<i>At first, I thought</i>
<i>she had a fight with Champ,</i>

317
00:23:57,625 --> 00:24:00,145
<i>or had problems at school</i>

318
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:02,705
<i>until that day</i>

319
00:24:03,465 --> 00:24:05,945
<i>when she told me the truth.</i>

320
00:24:17,425 --> 00:24:18,985
<i>Fai was pregnant.</i>

321
00:24:20,385 --> 00:24:21,785
Puifai was pregnant?

322
00:24:22,825 --> 00:24:24,145
Yes.

323
00:24:27,185 --> 00:24:32,705
Bell's Truth letter mentioned that
Bell took a friend to get an abortion.

324
00:24:33,945 --> 00:24:37,145
Which means the friend
who took Puifai for the abortion

325
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,545
was Bell.

326
00:24:44,865 --> 00:24:46,585
Then why Bell?

327
00:24:47,705 --> 00:24:49,065
Why not Champ?

328
00:24:51,905 --> 00:24:53,585
Jay might know something about this.

329
00:24:54,625 --> 00:24:56,145
Let's try asking him.

330
00:24:58,905 --> 00:25:02,025
But before we go home,

331
00:25:04,625 --> 00:25:06,785
let me do my duty
as a good homeowner first.

332
00:25:21,585 --> 00:25:24,065
You look more excited
than I am about moving in.

333
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:27,425
I'm just doing my job as a good homeowner.

334
00:25:29,985 --> 00:25:33,025
I wanted black,

335
00:25:33,545 --> 00:25:35,585
but why did you buy this color for me?

336
00:25:36,665 --> 00:25:40,785
I think your life needs a bit more color.

337
00:25:40,865 --> 00:25:43,385
My life isn't dull.

338
00:25:46,905 --> 00:25:48,225
Where have you guys been?

339
00:25:48,305 --> 00:25:49,865
I see.

340
00:25:49,945 --> 00:25:53,345
Hey, Kamin, there's a delivery.
I'll grab it for you.

341
00:26:01,665 --> 00:26:02,905
Here you are.

342
00:26:04,585 --> 00:26:05,825
Thank you.

343
00:26:08,985 --> 00:26:11,105
You even ordered deliveries
to the house now?

344
00:26:11,185 --> 00:26:12,425
Are you used to it already?

345
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:13,745
I guess so.

346
00:26:21,065 --> 00:26:23,665
Hey, Jay.

347
00:26:24,865 --> 00:26:26,665
Can I ask you something?

348
00:26:26,745 --> 00:26:28,065
Sure.

349
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:32,905
Did you know Puifai was pregnant?

350
00:26:33,945 --> 00:26:35,465
Puifai was pregnant?

351
00:26:37,785 --> 00:26:39,105
You didn't know?

352
00:26:40,865 --> 00:26:42,105
I didn't.

353
00:26:44,665 --> 00:26:46,705
You mean she died…

354
00:26:47,345 --> 00:26:49,105
while she was pregnant?

355
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:50,425
No.

356
00:26:51,865 --> 00:26:54,185
Bell took Puifai to get an abortion.

357
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:00,665
You seriously didn't know about this?

358
00:27:03,065 --> 00:27:04,425
I didn't.

359
00:27:05,505 --> 00:27:06,665
I only…

360
00:27:06,745 --> 00:27:10,705
Jay, I get that
you care about your friend,

361
00:27:10,785 --> 00:27:12,585
but what's done is done.

362
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,585
There's nothing you can do now.

363
00:27:16,465 --> 00:27:18,105
Look at me.

364
00:27:19,985 --> 00:27:21,905
You know something, don't you?

365
00:27:24,985 --> 00:27:26,385
Look at me!

366
00:27:30,585 --> 00:27:32,305
Last year, during freshman orientation,

367
00:27:35,825 --> 00:27:37,545
Puifai and I slept together by accident.

368
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:43,145
But it was just a one-night stand.

369
00:27:43,905 --> 00:27:45,625
Nothing more.

370
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:48,265
And you did that
while Champ was dating her, right?

371
00:27:49,985 --> 00:27:51,465
Are you insane?

372
00:27:52,225 --> 00:27:54,625
How could you keep
something this big from me?

373
00:27:54,705 --> 00:27:56,345
I didn't know she was pregnant.

374
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,225
That baby could've been yours.

375
00:27:59,185 --> 00:28:02,185
I know what shit
your friends did to Puifai,

376
00:28:04,345 --> 00:28:07,065
but I pray every day
that you weren't one of them.

377
00:28:07,145 --> 00:28:09,585
Captain, calm down.

378
00:28:09,665 --> 00:28:11,265
Don't let emotions take over.

379
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:13,785
I tried talking to Puifai.

380
00:28:16,585 --> 00:28:18,425
She told me to pretend
nothing ever happened.

381
00:28:18,505 --> 00:28:19,705
I don't believe a word you say anymore.

382
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:20,825
Just listen to me first!

383
00:28:20,905 --> 00:28:22,065
I'm listening!

384
00:28:22,145 --> 00:28:23,385
I always listen!

385
00:28:23,465 --> 00:28:25,825
You're the one
who never told me a damn thing!

386
00:28:25,905 --> 00:28:28,905
- Did you ever try to tell me?
- Don't you wonder why?

387
00:28:28,985 --> 00:28:31,465
Why we can't talk like we used to?

388
00:28:33,425 --> 00:28:36,305
Every time I wanted to tell you
or talk about something,

389
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:38,425
you never listened properly!

390
00:28:40,665 --> 00:28:42,465
You've always been like this!

391
00:29:01,345 --> 00:29:03,065
Are you okay?

392
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:06,465
I feel like I don't even know
my own brother.

393
00:29:10,185 --> 00:29:11,785
Or maybe it's my fault.

394
00:29:13,225 --> 00:29:15,505
Maybe I made him
too afraid to say anything.

395
00:30:03,745 --> 00:30:05,025
When did you buy this?

396
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:07,705
I don't have just one subordinate,
you know.

397
00:30:10,585 --> 00:30:11,985
Ken?

398
00:30:13,345 --> 00:30:15,305
Did you just steal
my favorite subordinate?

399
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:17,865
Lieutenant Ken is my subordinate too.

400
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:20,865
And he's very dedicated to his work.

401
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,345
I'm dedicated too.

402
00:30:25,425 --> 00:30:27,425
Then can I be your favorite subordinate?

403
00:30:28,225 --> 00:30:29,265
Sure.

404
00:30:30,905 --> 00:30:31,865
Really?

405
00:30:31,945 --> 00:30:33,665
Well, if you want to be
just a subordinate,

406
00:30:34,865 --> 00:30:36,505
then stay just a subordinate.

407
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,305
Hey, Inspector.

408
00:30:42,385 --> 00:30:44,985
I didn't know that was even an option.

409
00:30:49,625 --> 00:30:51,505
You're such a spoiled rich kid.

410
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:54,265
I bet you never did this
when you were in the States, right?

411
00:30:56,585 --> 00:30:58,145
That's right.

412
00:30:58,225 --> 00:30:59,385
I never did.

413
00:30:59,985 --> 00:31:02,545
Otherwise, I wouldn't pay
for the expensive hotel

414
00:31:03,345 --> 00:31:05,185
just to avoid doing stuff like this.

415
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:09,145
Well, here I am at your service.

416
00:31:09,705 --> 00:31:11,345
You won't have to waste money.

417
00:31:11,985 --> 00:31:15,185
Save it for your love nest.

418
00:31:16,745 --> 00:31:18,385
<i>And you're going in yourself?</i>

419
00:31:18,465 --> 00:31:20,145
Not my team.

420
00:31:20,225 --> 00:31:23,385
The operation is led by Yu
from the Special Investigation Unit.

421
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:25,865
Yu?

422
00:31:28,225 --> 00:31:32,825
Hey, tonight when we hit The Wild Hunt,

423
00:31:32,905 --> 00:31:37,905
Special Investigation Unit officers Yu
and Lee will be backing us up.

424
00:31:40,185 --> 00:31:41,625
You got any issues with them?

425
00:31:42,865 --> 00:31:44,465
Do I need to?

426
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:49,225
You looked jumpy
when Jay mentioned that name.

427
00:31:49,305 --> 00:31:50,745
Why?

428
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,225
Are you jealous?

429
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:58,105
I want to make sure your relationship

430
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:00,545
won't interfere with the mission.

431
00:32:04,665 --> 00:32:08,425
There's nothing going on between us.

432
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:49,385
There are CCTV cameras on every pillar.

433
00:32:50,465 --> 00:32:52,105
Behind the club, there's a curtain.

434
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:55,025
It could be a warehouse for drug deals.

435
00:32:56,665 --> 00:32:58,185
If we get inside,

436
00:32:58,265 --> 00:33:00,945
we might find clues
about the killer who bought drugs here.

437
00:33:04,625 --> 00:33:06,785
You got anything today?

438
00:33:31,585 --> 00:33:33,185
Hands out. Hurry up.

439
00:33:36,345 --> 00:33:37,225
Shit.

440
00:33:53,225 --> 00:33:55,345
You came this late.
Did you crawl here or what?

441
00:33:58,585 --> 00:34:00,105
You're such a pain in the ass.

442
00:34:00,185 --> 00:34:01,425
- Jade.
- Lee.

443
00:34:04,385 --> 00:34:06,185
You said there was no problem, right?

444
00:34:09,824 --> 00:34:11,105
I'm Inspector Kamin.

445
00:34:11,185 --> 00:34:12,784
This is Captain Jade.

446
00:34:13,304 --> 00:34:14,545
I think you already know him.

447
00:34:14,625 --> 00:34:16,865
Yeah. I'm Yu.

448
00:34:16,945 --> 00:34:17,784
This is Lee.

449
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:19,985
We're from the Special Investigation Unit.

450
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,465
What?

451
00:34:23,145 --> 00:34:24,105
I don't have any issues.

452
00:34:24,185 --> 00:34:25,585
You don't have to explain.

453
00:34:29,824 --> 00:34:32,705
Captain Jade and I
are investigating a drug case.

454
00:34:33,945 --> 00:34:37,225
Lee and I are investigating
an illegal boxing gambling case.

455
00:34:37,824 --> 00:34:39,585
If we find anything, we'll let you know.

456
00:34:43,145 --> 00:34:45,105
If you get any intel,

457
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:47,784
feel free to reach out.

458
00:34:58,185 --> 00:35:00,425
I heard from Nicoli, Kamin's a quiet guy,

459
00:35:01,105 --> 00:35:02,465
but I didn't expect him to be this quiet.

460
00:35:03,705 --> 00:35:05,425
And Jade is still a pain
in the ass as always.

461
00:35:05,505 --> 00:35:06,905
Lee!

462
00:35:22,265 --> 00:35:23,425
Hello, Inspector.

463
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:25,465
My boss is waiting.

464
00:35:45,705 --> 00:35:47,705
Nice to meet you, Inspector Kananon.

465
00:35:49,465 --> 00:35:52,625
Or should I just call you Mr. Kamin?

466
00:35:52,705 --> 00:35:54,745
Let's get straight to the point.

467
00:36:01,065 --> 00:36:02,505
Ten million

468
00:36:03,105 --> 00:36:04,505
over two years.

469
00:36:06,505 --> 00:36:08,625
Would that be enough compensation?

470
00:36:08,705 --> 00:36:11,385
In exchange for your help with…

471
00:36:14,225 --> 00:36:16,065
The Wild Hunt.

472
00:36:21,145 --> 00:36:22,585
Or tell me

473
00:36:23,785 --> 00:36:25,825
how much you want.

474
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,305
The only deal I'll make is this.

475
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,665
Shut this club down.

476
00:36:38,465 --> 00:36:39,945
Lee Seon Jae.

477
00:36:40,025 --> 00:36:43,945
I'm arresting you for bribing an officer.

478
00:36:53,465 --> 00:36:54,945
Hey, I'm heading back.

479
00:36:59,465 --> 00:37:01,225
Are you really sleeping here tonight?

480
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,585
Yeah, bro.

481
00:37:02,665 --> 00:37:04,905
What's with you? You've got a room
and you're still not going back?

482
00:37:04,985 --> 00:37:06,865
Damn, you're weirdly hardworking.

483
00:37:06,945 --> 00:37:08,425
Do whatever you want.

484
00:37:08,505 --> 00:37:09,985
Turn off the lights.

485
00:37:10,785 --> 00:37:11,745
Got it.

486
00:37:11,825 --> 00:37:14,745
You don't work during the day
but pull night shifts instead.

487
00:37:14,825 --> 00:37:16,305
Are you trying to get overtime pay?

488
00:37:17,465 --> 00:37:19,145
Just go home, bro.

489
00:37:19,225 --> 00:37:21,585
Stop nagging. I don't want to listen.

490
00:37:34,945 --> 00:37:36,465
Did you forget something?

491
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:37,865
Are you not going home?

492
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:45,385
Shit!

493
00:37:59,825 --> 00:38:01,425
My boss sent me to get you.

494
00:38:01,505 --> 00:38:03,505
Tell him to show his damn face himself.

495
00:38:03,585 --> 00:38:06,785
Come quietly, or we'll trade it
for your inspector's corpse.

496
00:38:14,025 --> 00:38:15,785
Truth or dare, my ass!

497
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,785
I already chose!

498
00:38:17,865 --> 00:38:19,625
Bell's fucking dead already!

499
00:38:19,705 --> 00:38:21,745
Wrong answer.

500
00:38:27,425 --> 00:38:29,105
Truth.

501
00:38:29,185 --> 00:38:30,025
Truth.

502
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,585
It seems like
you've got trouble with your ears.

503
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:35,385
Do you understand Thai?

504
00:38:36,305 --> 00:38:37,945
You're pretty bold.

505
00:38:38,585 --> 00:38:40,945
Do you want me
to speak your native language?

506
00:38:49,985 --> 00:38:51,505
Someone like me…

507
00:38:52,825 --> 00:38:55,225
doesn't like rejection.

508
00:38:56,065 --> 00:38:57,665
I'm not giving you a choice.

509
00:38:59,865 --> 00:39:01,465
I'm ordering you as a police officer.

510
00:39:22,185 --> 00:39:25,185
I'm pretty sure I can pull the trigger
faster than your men.

511
00:39:27,385 --> 00:39:28,705
Now tell me.

512
00:39:29,625 --> 00:39:31,065
Who did you sell drugs to?

513
00:39:33,825 --> 00:39:36,865
A lot of people.

514
00:39:36,945 --> 00:39:38,345
Don't mess with me!

515
00:39:40,065 --> 00:39:41,825
The illegal drugs you sold

516
00:39:42,785 --> 00:39:44,425
are tied to a murder case.

517
00:39:44,505 --> 00:39:47,265
On top of drug trafficking,

518
00:39:49,705 --> 00:39:52,025
you'll be charged as an accomplice.

519
00:39:53,625 --> 00:39:54,825
Really?

520
00:39:55,945 --> 00:39:57,225
Talk!

521
00:39:58,785 --> 00:40:00,025
Got it.

522
00:40:12,865 --> 00:40:15,265
You really want to know, huh?

523
00:40:16,585 --> 00:40:17,945
All right.

524
00:40:18,025 --> 00:40:19,585
But first,

525
00:40:23,185 --> 00:40:26,305
your guy has to win.

526
00:40:27,065 --> 00:40:30,985
Then I'll tell you.

527
00:40:38,785 --> 00:40:41,025
<i>And this is a special round.</i>

528
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:45,625
<i>Our challenger is the top cop</i>
<i>from the Investigation Unit.</i>

529
00:40:55,305 --> 00:40:56,985
Is it true

530
00:40:59,225 --> 00:41:01,265
that money can always buy you?

531
00:41:02,105 --> 00:41:04,105
No! It's not true!

532
00:41:04,185 --> 00:41:05,385
It's not!

533
00:41:05,465 --> 00:41:06,385
No!

534
00:41:06,465 --> 00:41:08,025
Wasn't it you

535
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:11,265
who sold Puifai's clip to Time
in exchange for money?

536
00:41:12,185 --> 00:41:13,505
Not me!

537
00:41:14,065 --> 00:41:15,745
I didn't do it!

538
00:41:15,825 --> 00:41:17,345
I didn't! Not me!

539
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:28,025
I sold my friend for money!

540
00:41:29,345 --> 00:41:31,025
Can you let me go now?

541
00:41:33,185 --> 00:41:34,745
What the hell do you want from me?

542
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,345
Your answer is correct.

543
00:41:38,985 --> 00:41:40,265
Then…

544
00:41:42,705 --> 00:41:46,265
use that money in hell.

545
00:41:49,745 --> 00:41:50,945
What the hell are you doing?

546
00:41:54,985 --> 00:41:57,265
You really care about your guy, huh?

547
00:41:58,385 --> 00:41:59,705
What should we do?

548
00:42:05,145 --> 00:42:06,425
Do you want to bet?

549
00:42:10,505 --> 00:42:12,025
If my guy loses,

550
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:14,145
I'll resign.

551
00:42:15,905 --> 00:42:17,545
But if he wins,

552
00:42:21,065 --> 00:42:22,745
you're going to prison.

553
00:42:22,825 --> 00:42:24,905
Nice!

554
00:42:26,305 --> 00:42:28,945
Go get Hong Wei to handle this cop.

555
00:42:29,025 --> 00:42:30,585
This is a special match.

556
00:42:30,665 --> 00:42:34,105
Whoever wins the bet
gets five times the payout.

557
00:42:42,505 --> 00:42:44,065
This is the only way we survive.

558
00:42:46,265 --> 00:42:47,905
<i>I've never lost to anyone.</i>

559
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:51,345
And the undefeated champion, Hong Wei!

560
00:42:55,585 --> 00:42:57,185
Even if it's this damn giant.

561
00:43:00,505 --> 00:43:03,585
Be careful, Jade.

562
00:43:04,705 --> 00:43:06,465
<i>Inspector,</i>

563
00:43:06,545 --> 00:43:07,785
<i>if I win,</i>

564
00:43:08,465 --> 00:43:09,945
can I get…

565
00:43:11,145 --> 00:43:13,065
what I asked for back at the house?

566
00:43:13,705 --> 00:43:15,345
Is this really the time to joke around?

567
00:43:15,425 --> 00:43:17,185
Hey, I'm serious.

568
00:43:18,305 --> 00:43:19,665
Deal?

569
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:21,825
Fine.

570
00:43:22,345 --> 00:43:23,825
Just don't lose.

571
00:43:54,345 --> 00:43:56,385
Don't waste your time being jealous of me.

572
00:43:57,425 --> 00:44:00,185
I've never helped Yu make a bed like this.

573
00:44:01,105 --> 00:44:03,345
You're my first, Inspector.

574
00:44:04,465 --> 00:44:05,865
Ever.

575
00:44:18,185 --> 00:44:21,105
I don't have eyes for anyone but you.

576
00:44:22,505 --> 00:44:25,025
Honestly, we don't have
to go through all this.

577
00:44:25,105 --> 00:44:27,105
Just move into my room.

578
00:44:27,185 --> 00:44:28,705
It's way easier.

579
00:44:28,785 --> 00:44:30,905
I signed a lease agreement,

580
00:44:32,145 --> 00:44:34,145
not a "sleep-in-the-same-room"
contract with you.

581
00:44:34,225 --> 00:44:39,865
Well then, I'll upgrade the lease
to a VVIP contract.

582
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:47,745
I'll give you one night to think about it.

583
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:50,745
I'll come get your answer.

584
00:44:53,745 --> 00:44:56,825
<i>Right now, it feels like the culprit</i>
<i>is always one step ahead of us.</i>

585
00:44:58,465 --> 00:45:00,345
<i>They know everything we're about to do.</i>

586
00:45:00,425 --> 00:45:03,025
That's why I suspect the culprit
might be someone on the inside.

587
00:45:03,105 --> 00:45:04,945
<i>You guys seem pretty close.</i>

588
00:45:05,025 --> 00:45:07,025
I was wondering if you ever…

589
00:45:08,345 --> 00:45:09,505
You mean, were we dating?

590
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,745
<i>Are we more than just boss</i>
<i>and subordinate now?</i>

591
00:45:12,825 --> 00:45:15,345
It's been that way for a long time.
You're the only one who didn't notice.
