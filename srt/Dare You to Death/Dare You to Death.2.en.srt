1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,960
<i>The new inspector is here.</i>

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,680
<i>Hello, Captain Jade.</i>

3
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,480
<i>So you studied abroad.</i>

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,520
- Are you as good as those in the movies?
- I bet you've watched too many movies.

5
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,760
<i>I think these seven kids</i>
<i>are hiding something from us.</i>

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:15,800
<i>And this one is the worst liar.</i>

7
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,080
Champ, why did you send me the letter?
What crap are you trying to pull on me?

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,160
Hey!

9
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,960
<i>I'll be in your care from now on,</i>

10
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,080
Inspector Kamin.

11
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,080
<i>Hello?</i>

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,400
Champ, why did you send me the letter?
What crap are you trying to pull on me?

13
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,360
<i>What the hell is wrong with you, Tar?</i>

14
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:36,120
Are you messing with me?
Where the hell are you?

15
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,800
We found midazolam
in the glasses and the liquor bottle.

16
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,880
It must have been mixed into the bottle

17
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,520
since the drug was found in every glass.

18
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,760
And the glasses only have fingerprints
from those seven kids, right?

19
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,600
Correct.

20
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,400
This looks like murder to me.

21
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,560
Don't jump to conclusions yet.

22
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,960
We need to wait for the autopsy report.

23
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,960
I'm just stating a possibility, Inspector.

24
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,760
I think whoever drugged them
was after something.

25
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,480
Are you sure you're not using drugs?

26
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,800
I'm clean.

27
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,880
Thank you.

28
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,240
We'll contact you
if we need anything else.

29
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,320
Of course, Inspector.

30
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,120
Here are the documents.

31
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,000
If you're sleepy,
maybe you should take a nap.

32
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,240
Fine. I'll go to sleep then.

33
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,760
Why are you staring at me like that?

34
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,280
You told me to sleep.

35
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,320
Have you ever heard of sarcasm?

36
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,000
This is work hours.

37
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,120
Why aren't you gathering more info on Tar?

38
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,440
Hello, Lieutenant Pai?

39
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,480
This is the Captain speaking.

40
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,680
Can you look into a boy named Tar?

41
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,920
I think there's something off about him.

42
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,440
<i>Sure. Do you need anything else?</i>

43
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:27,680
Check with our undercover team
about drug dealers around the area too.

44
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,960
I think these kids
might be using something,

45
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,240
but I want to know
where they're getting it from.

46
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:35,360
<i>Understood.</i>

47
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,800
I'll leave it to you.

48
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,960
So I can go to sleep now, right?

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,120
You command people with your mouth?

50
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,880
That's called teamwork.

51
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,640
Do you know what dividing tasks is?

52
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
And if I want to use my mouth to work,

53
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,800
why not?

54
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,560
My mouth works

55
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,800
pretty well.

56
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,160
Hello?

57
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,440
<i>Hello, Inspector.</i>

58
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,120
<i>We have the autopsy results.</i>

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,320
Got it. I'll be right there.

60
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,720
If you want to hear the results,
you can come along.

61
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,680
Or take a nap. I'm fine with that.

62
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,720
You told me to come with you, right?

63
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,040
Then drive yourself.

64
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,800
Don't you have a car?

65
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,840
Just so you know,

66
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:59,840
I'd rather die than ride with you.

67
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,480
I'll drive myself.

68
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,400
And who said you're riding with me?

69
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:13,080
Do you know 2025
is the hottest year on record?

70
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:18,600
I'm sorry,
but why did you even tell me that?

71
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,080
The more we drive,

72
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,640
the hotter the planet gets.

73
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:28,400
A good police officer should care
about the earth, right, Inspector?

74
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,840
Hello, doctor.

75
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,720
Hello.

76
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,720
We're sorry for the delay, Inspector.

77
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,760
Our forensic department is small,

78
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,240
so we have limited doctors.

79
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,280
It's all right.

80
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,160
Doctor, what do the test results say?

81
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,720
We found three substances
in the victim's blood.

82
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,000
Sodium thiopental,

83
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,960
pancuronium bromide,

84
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,840
and potassium chloride.

85
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,200
These three are used
for death row inmates.

86
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,120
REPORT: THREE SUBSTANCES FOUND

87
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,040
The cause of death is heart failure.

88
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,720
What exactly does that mean?

89
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:27,480
These three substances are
medical-grade drugs

90
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,160
that must be controlled
and used in precise doses.

91
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,320
And here,
there's a needle mark on her arm.

92
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,040
Judging from the mark,
it was injected shortly before she died.

93
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:45,760
So the killer injected all three drugs
into Puifai, correct?

94
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,960
Yes.

95
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,480
It was injected in an excessive dose.

96
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,600
Based on the results,
I'd consider it a murder.

97
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:07,160
The time of death is 12:15 to 1:00 a.m.

98
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,840
When did they make the call?

99
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,760
At 2:00 a.m.

100
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:16,000
So they called the ambulance first.

101
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
Correct.

102
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:21,320
Once we got the call, emergency responders
were dispatched immediately.

103
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,200
But aren't you a forensic doctor?

104
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:32,200
Yes, but we're short-staffed,
so we help other departments too.

105
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,480
That night,
when she called to report the case,

106
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,080
I personally answered it.

107
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,679
I think she called
sometime after 1:00 a.m.

108
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,200
Hold on.

109
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,520
She?

110
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,120
So it was a female caller?

111
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,920
Yes. It was a female's voice.

112
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,160
Then who actually called the ambulance?

113
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,640
Cherreen said Tonkla called, didn't she?

114
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,040
They might've just been confused
and given wrong statements.

115
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,880
Wrong statements
or intentionally misleading us?

116
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,040
Which do you think?

117
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:42,600
Lieutenant Pai reported
they still can't reach Tar.

118
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,400
If we want to know
whether they're messing with us,

119
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,960
we'll have to put pressure on Cherreen.

120
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,240
Where are you?

121
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:10,320
When the cops questioned you today,
did you say anything?

122
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,600
Let's meet this evening.

123
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,520
Same place.

124
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,840
Cher!

125
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,240
Why are you early?

126
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,920
Come on, let's get something to eat.

127
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,960
Champ, you asshole!

128
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,560
I'M AT THE BAR.

129
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,720
COME TALK TO ME, ASSHOLE.

130
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
Hey, relax.

131
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,160
Don't stress. Chill a bit.

132
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,440
Chill? How could I?

133
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,960
Unlike you, my dad is not a politician.

134
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,120
The police called earlier.
They said they're coming to meet me here.

135
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,320
Why?

136
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,440
I don't know.

137
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:20,920
They just told me to stay here
and not go anywhere.

138
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,080
Champ, can't your dad help me?

139
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm scared.

140
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,520
Scared of what?

141
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,080
You didn't do anything wrong.

142
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:39,640
You know how panicky I get.

143
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:44,200
What if they ask something
and I panic and say something stupid?

144
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,040
Please.

145
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,440
<i>Are you here yet, asshole?</i>
<i>Let's get this straight.</i>

146
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,720
Did Tar send that?

147
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,280
Yeah.

148
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,720
He called this morning,
saying he got a letter.

149
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,320
He was talking nonsense, cursing nonstop,

150
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,480
telling me to meet him at the bar.

151
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,120
I don't know if he was high or what.

152
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,360
I have no idea
what the hell he was talking about.

153
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,720
He kept talking about truth or dare
over and over.

154
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,880
When are the police coming?

155
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:26,920
I don't know. I'm hungry.

156
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,120
- Should we go eat something first?
- Hello.

157
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
Oh, officers?

158
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,840
Do you have a problem with my friend?
You told her to wait here.

159
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,600
We're just asking for your cooperation.

160
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,240
Why are you upset?

161
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:47,960
I'll ask one more time.

162
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:51,720
Who called the hospital
the night of the incident?

163
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,000
Well…

164
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,120
Tonkla did.

165
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,280
But the hospital said
it was a female's voice.

166
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,040
The caller had a sweet voice.

167
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,200
Probably a girl in her twenties.

168
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,120
It sounded soft and nervous too.

169
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,560
It actually sounded a lot like you.

170
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,600
So who called?

171
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,440
It's not hard to spot a liar.

172
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,600
Maybe we just got confused.

173
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,800
It's just about who called.
Why are you making it a big deal?

174
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,040
Whoever called,
it was still one of my friends, right?

175
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,080
It's because your stories don't tally.

176
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,480
That's why we're finding out the truth.

177
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,560
If you were confused that night,

178
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,960
that's understandable.

179
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,720
You still can't think clearly today?

180
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,280
I… I'm sorry.

181
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,840
I was the one who called. I got mixed up.

182
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,800
Anything else
you haven't told the truth about?

183
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,760
No.

184
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,640
And did you two contact Tar?

185
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,600
What about him now?

186
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,480
You have to go see him again, huh?

187
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,720
If I find out any of you
are hiding evidence,

188
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,800
I will charge you
with obstruction of justice.

189
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,160
As for you,

190
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,360
I don't care who your father is
or how powerful he is.

191
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,400
Anyone acting suspiciously
will face charges.

192
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:34,080
Today is the last day I'll go easy on you.

193
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,680
But I honestly don't know
what Tar was rambling about.

194
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,400
He called me saying he got a letter.

195
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,760
He accused me
of sending it to mess with him.

196
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,600
I didn't do anything.

197
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,600
What letter?

198
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,520
No idea.

199
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,400
Something like a truth or dare letter.

200
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,880
Explain it clearly.

201
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,040
If you can't,

202
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,480
we'll bring you in for more questioning.

203
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,880
Champ, just tell them.

204
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,720
We didn't do anything anyway.

205
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,080
Let me be clear.

206
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,800
We have nothing to do with this.

207
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,160
<i>Tar may look nerdy,</i>

208
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,680
<i>but he wears glasses to hide</i>
<i>the fact that he's a womanizer.</i>

209
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,080
<i>At first, he pretends he tutors girls.</i>

210
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,320
<i>After tutoring?</i>

211
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,440
<i>He doesn't send them home.</i>

212
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,440
<i>He drags them to a hotel.</i>

213
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,360
<i>If they resist, he drugs them.</i>

214
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,640
<i>He secretly records</i>
<i>every girl he sleeps with.</i>

215
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,800
<i>That's why none of them dares speak up.</i>

216
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,560
<i>When he's drunk, he brags about it.</i>

217
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,040
<i>But he looks so nerdy</i>
<i>that no one would suspect him.</i>

218
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,480
He told me to meet him at the bar
to clear things up,

219
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:43,840
but I didn't go.

220
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,000
He's insane.

221
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,640
Who the hell has time
to send him a letter?

222
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,400
Which bar was it?

223
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,280
Drink Me, of course.

224
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,000
That's the Avengers' regular place.

225
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:58,160
Hey, stop sounding weird, okay?

226
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,520
Hey, hold on.

227
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:12,720
So that means Cherreen and I
are cleared, right?

228
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,359
It's not that easy.

229
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,839
What's with you?

230
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,720
You called me in
for an off-the-record interrogation.

231
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:22,720
I told you everything.

232
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,480
Why don't you keep your promise?

233
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,319
What kind of cops are you?

234
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,000
We're just collecting information today.

235
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,920
Right, Inspector?

236
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,920
And no one said
you two are off the suspect list.

237
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,200
But if you didn't do anything wrong,

238
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,160
you don't need to be scared, right?

239
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,760
Until we find the killer,

240
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,240
every one of you is still a suspect.

241
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,120
Let's go.

242
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,000
You saw that, right?

243
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:23,360
They were even linking arms.

244
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:25,520
I think something's off.

245
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,800
No wonder he doesn't even seem sad

246
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,880
about his girlfriend's death.

247
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,880
Didn't his politician dad
teach him anything?

248
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,560
He should have faked some grief

249
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,040
to hide his side chick.

250
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,520
Damn it!

251
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,880
Dude, what's wrong?

252
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,440
Have you been stressed lately?

253
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,320
Thank you.

254
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,600
Hey, look at that new girl.

255
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,000
She's as white as snow.

256
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,320
Let's take your stress off, okay?

257
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,920
- Yeah, a little release might help.
- Fine. I'll set it up.

258
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:37,760
Excuse me, my friend's interested.

259
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,840
Do you do off-site work?

260
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,760
Wait. You've got a condom?

261
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,400
No. Who carries one around?

262
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,680
Then I won't do it.

263
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,880
I already paid, so you're doing it.

264
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,120
How much?

265
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,040
Ten thousand?

266
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:06,640
I don't want the money. I want safety.

267
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,520
You look nerdy.

268
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,480
Don't you know what safe sex is?

269
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Is 30,000 enough?

270
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,080
With this,
you won't have to work for days.

271
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,800
Fine. Once raw, once with a condom.

272
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,920
I'll go get one from my friend.

273
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,440
Fine. Such a hassle.

274
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,400
Who are you?

275
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,840
What are you doing to me?

276
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:55,400
Don't come closer!

277
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,760
Help!

278
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:57,960
Asshole!

279
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,520
Truth or dare?

280
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,360
Truth! I'll talk now!

281
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,720
Truth!

282
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:23,680
Did you rape Puifai?

283
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,440
- I didn't!
- Did you?

284
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,200
I said I didn't!

285
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:38,080
- Last chance!
- Wait, okay!

286
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,640
I did it!

287
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,160
I raped Puifai!

288
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,280
Let me go!

289
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,360
What are you going to do to me now?

290
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,520
I already told the truth!

291
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,240
Let me go!

292
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,280
I already told the truth!

293
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,280
Hey.

294
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,000
I think your suit

295
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,440
looks a bit tight today.

296
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,960
- That's none of your business.
- At least loosen your tie.

297
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,120
You've worn it all day. Let me help.

298
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,760
Just trust me a bit, okay?

299
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,560
Just once.

300
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,400
Let me help.

301
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,280
Here you go.

302
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,120
Isn't it uncomfortable
wearing something so tight?

303
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,520
Just undo one button.

304
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,120
That's it.

305
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,280
You're looking sharp.

306
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,240
Are you satisfied now?

307
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,920
All right, let's go inside.

308
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,040
Hey?

309
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:46,760
Hey!

310
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,000
There's nothing here.

311
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,160
You're sure we didn't miss any spots?

312
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,160
How would I know?

313
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,440
I don't own this place.

314
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,760
I don't know every corner here.

315
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,760
Hey, are you okay?

316
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,680
What happened?

317
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,160
Shit!

318
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,800
How was I supposed to know Tar would come?

319
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,560
Didn't you arrange to meet him?

320
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,160
Then why are you here?

321
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,960
I just came to drink.

322
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:34,880
I have other friends too.

323
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,800
What do you know
about the truth or dare letter?

324
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,240
What letter?

325
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,600
I told you I don't know anything!

326
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,160
Truth or dare, my ass.

327
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:19,560
You're sure?

328
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,040
Like I said,

329
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,800
I only went out to buy condoms.

330
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:30,040
Why did it take you so long?
You took almost 30 minutes.

331
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:35,720
I went to get one from my friend first,
but she didn't have any.

332
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,200
So I went to buy them myself.

333
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:41,360
When you came back, did you see anyone?

334
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,080
Okay.

335
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,160
The closest convenience store
is 800 meters away.

336
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,440
I don't think that
the escort was lying to us.

337
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:13,280
She might still be an accomplice.

338
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,400
Have you checked the CCTV?

339
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:21,120
Yes, but the area where it happened
is a blind spot.

340
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:23,440
And the closest camera…

341
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,720
broke last night.

342
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,640
We need a new strategy.

343
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,120
We can't let them stay
a step ahead of us every time.

344
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,920
Agreed,

345
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,720
but we can't do anything else tonight.

346
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,680
We must head back.

347
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
Come. I'll drop you off.

348
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:47,600
Drop me off at my unit.

349
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,960
Are you crazy?

350
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:51,040
It's late.

351
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,280
Not sleeping enough is a quick way to die.

352
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:57,840
When I sleep and when I die
are my problems.

353
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,200
Give it to me.

354
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,040
No.

355
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,920
Hey!

356
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,440
Come on, Inspector!

357
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,360
Fine.

358
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,800
You want the key, right?

359
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,200
Here you are.

360
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,480
Just take it.

361
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,360
Hey, hold on!

362
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,440
How brave you are!

363
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,520
You're touching confiscated evidence!

364
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,280
What did you just say?

365
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:39,920
Don't you have any professional ethics?

366
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,320
You've been tense all day.
I just wanted to make you smile.

367
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,400
Come on, let me drive.

368
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,080
Hurry up.

369
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:56,480
A handsome, generous, kind,
and morally upright guy like me

370
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,080
doesn't come around often.

371
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,200
Oh, wow.

372
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,200
That actually works.

373
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,880
I changed my mind.

374
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,080
I'll take you to the hotel
so you can pack your things.

375
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:18,800
Pack? Why?

376
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,040
Hey, Inspector?

377
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,960
Is that all you're bringing?

378
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,240
Well, I don't know how long I'll stay.

379
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,120
Should I move my whole house?

380
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,840
Come on, Inspector.

381
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,680
Do you really not trust me?

382
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:21,040
Even a five-star hotel
can't help you sleep comfortably.

383
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,520
That's pretty bad, right?

384
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,160
You definitely need a new place.

385
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,520
Somewhere you can feel more comfortable.

386
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,840
Is that new place crowded?

387
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,080
I don't like crowds.

388
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:39,200
Inspector, I'm a local here.

389
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,160
I was born and raised in Bangkok.
Wherever I go, people know me.

390
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:46,040
I guarantee the new place
is more private than this place.

391
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,320
Let's go.

392
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,040
I'm also offering you an extra service.

393
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,200
I'll carry your luggage.

394
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,360
Follow me.

395
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,640
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

396
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,160
<i>You brought me to your house?</i>

397
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,360
- No way. I'm going back to the hotel.
- Wait, Inspector.

398
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,960
Just try sleeping here first.

399
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,960
You couldn't sleep at the hotel anyway

400
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,640
and it's late.

401
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,880
Don't make things harder.

402
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,840
And if I still can't sleep?

403
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,600
Then go back to the hotel tomorrow.

404
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:39,400
Welcome to Jay-Jade Guesthouse.

405
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:43,240
So you're part of this too?

406
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,240
He said he'd split the rent with me.

407
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,240
Your room is ready
on the second floor, Mr. Kamin.

408
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:52,640
As for the rent,

409
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,120
I'll charge you only half the hotel price.

410
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,120
That's such a great deal, right?

411
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:01,520
By the way, how much was the hotel room?

412
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,160
One hundred eighty thousand.

413
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:08,960
One hundred eighty thousand?

414
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,160
I chose a five-star hotel
so I wouldn't have to do anything.

415
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,520
That way, I could also focus on work.

416
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,640
We're also offering
a five-star service, right?

417
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:25,480
Then I'll give you a friendly price.

418
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:30,720
Fifty thousand.

419
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Forty thousand.

420
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,240
Pretty worth it, right?

421
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,560
Think of it as circulating the economy.

422
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:43,440
That's more like circulating
from my pocket into yours.

423
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,840
So should we bring
the rest of your stuff tomorrow?

424
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,720
I haven't agreed to anything.

425
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:55,160
I'll stay for one trial night
with conditions.

426
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,840
If I'm not satisfied,
I leave whenever I want.

427
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:07,160
You're a tenant now, not an inspector.

428
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:09,639
Don't try to boss me around.

429
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:14,560
Whether it's one day or several,
write a contract.

430
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,760
I can't trust anyone easily these days.
There are too many scammers.

431
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,639
Okay. That's fair enough.

432
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:25,000
You really sound like someone
who studied abroad.

433
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,440
Then I'll start your service tonight.

434
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,199
You haven't eaten yet, right?

435
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
- Would you like anything?
- I'm not hungry.

436
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,760
I'll get back to work.

437
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,520
How about something simple then?

438
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,560
Chef Jay.

439
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,800
Yes?

440
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,639
What's on the menu tonight?

441
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:55,320
Tonight's dish features
the main ingredients from the Thai sea,

442
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:58,120
blended perfectly
with every regional flavor.

443
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,720
It's mackerel pasta
with spicy anchovy sauce

444
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,040
and seasonal vegetables.

445
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,920
What exactly is that?

446
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:10,640
What is that?

447
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,800
- Spicy fermented rice noodle salad.
- What?

448
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,520
Spicy fermented rice noodle salad.

449
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,920
I'll excuse myself for now.

450
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,640
We prepared breakfast for you, Inspector.

451
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,080
Did you sleep well last night?

452
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,200
Well, it was fine.

453
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,440
I'm sorry that
I'm not dressed very formally.

454
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,680
I had to wake up early
to cook breakfast for you.

455
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:58,640
But…

456
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
What?

457
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,800
I'm wearing pants, you know.

458
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,400
You should get used to this.

459
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,360
You're going to see it a lot.

460
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,800
Captain.

461
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,320
I'm moving out.

462
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,440
Oh no!

463
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,880
You can't order me around here.

464
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,560
You haven't even signed
the rental contract.

465
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,880
How can you move out?

466
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:27,080
Please take a seat.

467
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,440
Make yourself comfortable.

468
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,920
- Jay.
- Yes?

469
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,240
We need to talk.

470
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:53,480
What?

471
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,280
You've heard about Tar, right?

472
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,880
Yeah.

473
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,240
We weren't that close, actually.

474
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,400
He was closer to Champ.

475
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,520
I still didn't expect him to die.

476
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,440
Let me ask you a few things.

477
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,160
Were Tar and Tonkla close?

478
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:22,800
I never saw them hang out together.

479
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,680
Not even for drinks?

480
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,280
Like at Drink Me?

481
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,480
Drink Me?

482
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,800
No way Tonkla would go there.

483
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,560
He said it's expensive
and the drinks suck.

484
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,720
The only regulars there are Champ and Tar.

485
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,320
And it's outside work hours.

486
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:49,720
I'm not answering anything else.
I'm off to class.

487
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,560
Goodbye.

488
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,560
If Tonkla doesn't like going to Drink Me,

489
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,160
why did he show up there?

490
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,480
No idea.

491
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,920
But for Tar's case,

492
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,360
we need to start at his house.

493
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:21,840
Guys.

494
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,920
Seriously, I'm kind of scared.

495
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,120
Did your brother tell you anything?

496
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,960
No. He keeps asking questions.

497
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,960
Did you tell him anything?

498
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,560
I didn't say a word.

499
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,000
Hey.

500
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:57,760
Did anyone get a truth or dare letter?

501
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,760
What the hell is that?

502
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,200
The cops asked me that too.

503
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,760
Cops?

504
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,400
How could they ask you?

505
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,440
I passed by Drink Me.

506
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,200
They recognized me and started asking.

507
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,000
Why were you there?

508
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,560
Where are you going?

509
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:29,720
I forgot I'd taken a job.

510
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,040
All right.

511
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,600
What the hell is wrong with him?

512
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,200
Jade.

513
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,920
You sick piece of shit!

514
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,000
You know, sometimes
I almost side with the killer.

515
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,720
No matter how shitty someone is,

516
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,320
no one has the right to play vigilante.

517
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,080
Have you found the letter yet?

518
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,480
Tar's mom said he rushed out.

519
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,760
It has to be around here.

520
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,120
Filthy bastard!

521
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,200
Inspector.

522
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,080
This is no longer a simple murder.

523
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,320
The killer's targeting this entire group.

524
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:22,680
I think we're dealing

525
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,680
with a serial killer.

526
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,800
YOU KNEW WHAT THEY DID AND YOU DID NOTHING
BECAUSE THEY BOUGHT YOU OFF

527
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,600
Answer the goddamn call, you idiot!

528
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:19,920
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Hello.

529
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,280
Jay, did you get the letter?

530
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,640
Don't lie to me.

531
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,680
Why are you so obsessed with the letter?

532
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:29,600
Stop being a smartass and just answer.
Did you get one?

533
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,600
<i>No. Happy now?</i>

534
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,440
Did any of your friends get one?

535
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,920
I don't know.

536
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,440
I'm hanging up.

537
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,640
Jay.

538
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:41,560
Jay?

539
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,880
Hey!

540
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:45,520
Shit!

541
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,160
At least your brother isn't next.

542
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:55,000
Given how dumb he is,
he could get picked anytime.

543
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:56,720
I'll deal with him myself.

544
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Hey.

545
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,080
This is exactly what the killer wants.

546
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:06,640
If you do that, you're playing their game.

547
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:11,880
Don't give them what they want.

548
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,720
What matters now is

549
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,320
keeping Jay in our sight at all times.

550
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,440
For his safety.

551
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:45,240
Inspector.

552
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,480
Let me be honest here.

553
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:51,440
Do you think the two of us
can really stop this?

554
00:44:56,120 --> 00:44:57,960
If we work together,

555
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:00,520
we'll catch the killer.

556
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:13,400
I'll stake my badge on it.

557
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:34,800
Hey.

558
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,640
Where are my clothes?

559
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,640
And what is this?

560
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:43,920
Pajamas.

561
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,320
Everything in the closet is yours to wear.

562
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:48,720
I'm generous.

563
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:53,680
And I already washed your clothes for you.

564
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:57,680
I'll wear my own clothes.

565
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,720
Give them back.

566
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:00,880
Hey.

567
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,720
I'm the owner here.

568
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:06,320
At the hotel,

569
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,200
dry cleaning was 1,000 per piece, right?

570
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:10,200
Here at my place,

571
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,760
I'll only charge 300.

572
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:13,880
Deal?

573
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,560
Gotcha, look at your face.

574
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,040
You like it, don't you?

575
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,400
My clothes need to be handled with care.

576
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,800
If they get damaged,

577
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:28,800
I'll charge you 10,000 per piece.

578
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,720
They won't get damaged.

579
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,760
You can even charge me 100,000,

580
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,360
but…

581
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,520
I'll pay with my body instead.

582
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:47,440
That won't be enough.

583
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,920
Hold on.

584
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,760
Inspector.

585
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,080
Don't worry, Inspector.

586
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:00,440
Everything of yours…

587
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,560
will definitely be handled with care.

588
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:22,120
<i>I want to know what the killer's motive is</i>

589
00:47:22,200 --> 00:47:23,840
<i>and who the next target will be.</i>

590
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,040
I just want to test Champ to see
if he's hiding something.

591
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,480
<i>Next time, you should be careful.</i>

592
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,320
<i>If something happens to you,</i>
<i>how am I supposed to live?</i>

593
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:35,160
<i>You're that desperate for me</i>
<i>to stay at your place.</i>

594
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:36,360
<i>Are you lacking some warmth?</i>

595
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,080
<i>So are you going to give me that warmth?</i>
