1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,974
<i>You'll stay with me for now, Rebecca,</i>

2
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:18,226
so you can bond with Anastasia.

3
00:00:18,309 --> 00:00:20,603
I've also brought Baby Jed there,

4
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:22,188
so you can bond with him too.

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:24,399
So, that way,
you can establish a relationship

6
00:00:24,482 --> 00:00:25,817
with one another.

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,985
<i>They're my twins?</i>

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,404
<i>We'll return the twins to you.</i>

9
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:30,655
Is the pain getting worse?

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:31,906
It seems…

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,033
It seems the pain is recurring.

12
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,534
Just relax.

13
00:00:34,617 --> 00:00:36,745
Maybe you're too tense.

14
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:37,829
I owe you so much.

15
00:00:37,912 --> 00:00:40,415
None of this would have happened
if it weren't for you.

16
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,292
Thank you very much.

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,003
I'm flying to our private island
in Palawan.

18
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,755
I just want to breathe.

19
00:00:46,838 --> 00:00:47,922
Then, I will go with you.

20
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,632
For what? To watch over me

21
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:51,301
and make sure I won't escape?

22
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,427
No.

23
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,765
To make sure you don't harm yourself.

24
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,559
I don't want you
to lose control of yourself.

25
00:00:59,642 --> 00:01:01,603
I care for you.

26
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:02,979
I don't want you to die.

27
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,647
Whether you like it or not,

28
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,900
I'm coming with you to Palawan.

29
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:12,864
Sir Galvan's guests are annoying.

30
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:14,282
If they had left earlier,

31
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:15,742
we would have escaped earlier.

32
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,410
Who are we escaping from?

33
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,871
Who said we were escaping?

34
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:20,955
You.

35
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:24,209
We're not escaping.

36
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:27,212
I said, if their car hadn't blocked us,

37
00:01:27,295 --> 00:01:28,254
we would have gotten out earlier,

38
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,423
and gone to your sister.

39
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,592
PREVIOUSLY

40
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:35,887
George, my water just broke.

41
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,186
<i>I need to deliver your baby, Sam,</i>

42
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:46,356
<i>because I'll be the one</i>
<i>to take your child.</i>

43
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:57,367
So, I made everybody believe, right?

44
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:01,579
I guess I also made Sam…

45
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,248
believe that I can forgive her.

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,208
Mom…

47
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,086
My anger towards Sam will never disappear

48
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,171
until I die.

49
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,718
Wait, George.

50
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,721
So, you're just fooling Sam?

51
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:20,473
You're just playing her?

52
00:02:21,224 --> 00:02:25,270
You made her believe
that you've forgiven her already,

53
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,604
but you will still sue her.

54
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,984
I don't understand you anymore.

55
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:35,029
I will no longer sue Sam.

56
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:37,991
I will patch things up with her again.

57
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:41,828
I will make her believe that we're okay.

58
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,830
I will gain her trust.

59
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:47,333
And if I do that,

60
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:50,128
it would be easier for me to get the baby

61
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,045
after she has given birth.

62
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:55,049
I'm thinking Hong Kong.

63
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,220
No… Europe.

64
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:03,182
That's where I will take…

65
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:04,934
and raise Sam's baby…

66
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,687
My future baby.

67
00:03:15,361 --> 00:03:16,571
False alarm, Sam.

68
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,449
There's no cervical dilation.
Your baby is stable.

69
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,910
Okay, let's put down your legs slowly.

70
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:23,870
- Careful…
- So, Doc…

71
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:26,247
I'm still scheduled
to give birth next week?

72
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,082
Most likely yes.

73
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,919
You know, maybe you were
just stressed and overwhelmed.

74
00:03:33,296 --> 00:03:36,257
That's why you had
Braxton-Hicks Contractions.

75
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:39,010
I think it's stress, Doc.

76
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,179
She's worried for her sibling.

77
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,140
Sam, listen to me.

78
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:47,852
You have to focus on yourself
and your baby.

79
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:49,896
Avoid thinking

80
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,523
about any stressful thing around you.

81
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,691
Okay?

82
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,654
Why?

83
00:03:58,655 --> 00:03:59,656
What's with the face?

84
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,492
Nothing, I just got excited.

85
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,703
I thought I'd see the baby.

86
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,207
Me too…

87
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,375
But, don't worry.

88
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,919
You'll only wait for a week.

89
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,799
We will wait.

90
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,106
So…

91
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,109
Sam will give birth next week, Kate?

92
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,319
No, George.

93
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,365
Based on her symptoms
and the baby's position,

94
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,075
she could give birth anytime.

95
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:46,202
What?

96
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,998
So, I need to execute my plan.

97
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,582
As in any moment?

98
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,043
Yes.

99
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,129
So, better make sure

100
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:59,382
you're ready with what you're going to do.

101
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,926
Kate, I'm ready.

102
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,511
I've been ready since last month.

103
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:08,016
It seems I will soon see my Baby Gilbert.

104
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,522
It's late.

105
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,983
Aren't we going to be late for our flight?

106
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:18,693
I don't think so.

107
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,570
And it's your sister who will tell us

108
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:23,114
what time we'll go to the airport,

109
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,701
but no word from her yet. No chat or text.

110
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,870
And you…

111
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,455
Don't tell anyone

112
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:34,751
that we're leaving to go abroad.

113
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,252
It'll be our secret.

114
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:39,756
There you go again
with your secrets, Mother.

115
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:41,132
- Uhm…
- What's wrong

116
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,091
if we're going abroad?

117
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,426
You'll see.

118
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,303
Well, it's your sister who said
it's better no one knows

119
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,805
that we're leaving, so no one will meddle.

120
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:53,936
Ruth?

121
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:56,731
Ruth?

122
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:59,484
Hey, Mercy is there.

123
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,488
Don't mention anything, please.

124
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,036
Mercy?

125
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:20,588
Ruth, do you know where George is?

126
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:24,842
I'm worried about her and Sam.

127
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,178
Did you receive a call or text from them?

128
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,516
Ask Mom…

129
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,268
Didn't we have an agreement
with George that we'll meet at…

130
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,645
Oh, right.

131
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,438
Yes, Mercy.

132
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:38,564
Before she left,

133
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,109
she told me
that we'd meet outside to have dinner,

134
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,236
but she didn't send a text or a chat,

135
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,530
so I don't know anymore.

136
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:50,159
Is that so? It's dangerous,
especially since the weather is bad.

137
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,286
If both of them are missing,

138
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,247
we need help.

139
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,338
Sergeant Royales?

140
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:11,180
Good thing your things are prepared.

141
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,058
I'll just get the other stuff
in the car later.

142
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:17,228
Good thing I saw this water tank.

143
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,980
Let's stay under this.

144
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,648
George, it hurts.

145
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,150
I'll go first.

146
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:24,944
I'll assist you. Careful.

147
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:26,070
Okay.

148
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,325
Hold on.

149
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:35,037
Careful.

150
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,125
George, it hurts so much.

151
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:41,127
Just wait.

152
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,545
I'll just fix this.

153
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,925
Wait a second, Sam.

154
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,054
Go ahead and lie down.

155
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:54,974
Okay.

156
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:58,019
Lie down. Careful.

157
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:04,066
Sit down.

158
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,568
Okay.

159
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,570
Careful.

160
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,156
Your shoes…

161
00:08:11,532 --> 00:08:13,034
Okay, can you handle it?

162
00:08:13,117 --> 00:08:14,076
Okay.

163
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,589
Let's do this.

164
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:43,523
George, thank you.

165
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,985
If Paco were still alive…

166
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:50,655
I'd wish him to be here.

167
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,287
Our work will be done after two days,

168
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,706
so we can turn them over to you.

169
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:02,583
Good job. Good job, Sam.

170
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,460
Thank you, sir.

171
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,045
We have to be on schedule.

172
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:07,922
Thank you again for the opportunity, sir.

173
00:09:08,005 --> 00:09:09,131
No problem.

174
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,551
You can accompany Sir.

175
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:23,854
- Here, ma'am.
- Thank you.

176
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,866
Michael, can you please

177
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,785
get the other jar there.

178
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:40,162
- The one that's a bit colorful.
- I like that.

179
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,080
Please.

180
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,213
Sorry, I thought you were my staff.

181
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,881
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

182
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,175
I can be your staff for today.

183
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,053
No, no. It's okay. I can handle this.

184
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,305
Thank you.

185
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,390
How about this one?

186
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,852
Sure. Thank you.

187
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:12,361
There you are. So, you've met Sam?

188
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:14,947
Yes, we've met…

189
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,158
again.

190
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:19,076
Again?

191
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:23,998
Yes, we've met before, in the cemetery.

192
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,341
You're that girl?

193
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,925
What do you mean that girl?

194
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,054
About five years ago,

195
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:39,680
Paco told me about you both meeting.

196
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,183
His remarks were a bit off,

197
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:44,226
so you scolded him.

198
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,437
He couldn't forget that.

199
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,314
That was the first time
someone called him out.

200
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,275
No one has talked to Paco like that.

201
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,528
Well, maybe I'm not like everyone.

202
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,156
Small world, right?

203
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:59,116
You saw her here

204
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,702
and I'm not acting like a cupid,

205
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,288
but maybe this is the best time for you

206
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,582
to get to know each other.

207
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,958
Paco is single,

208
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:09,752
and you're single too, right?

209
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,257
Sorry. But, sir, I'm really busy.

210
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,717
- Yeah, right.
- Sorry.

211
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,260
But, how about after work?

212
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,762
There's a bar downstairs.

213
00:11:19,845 --> 00:11:22,640
I will be there, 7 p.m.

214
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,893
Of course, no pressure.

215
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,771
Sam…

216
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,231
Trust me.

217
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,733
My friend is a good person.

218
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:35,027
If he fools you,

219
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,489
this Paco Palacios will answer to me.

220
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:11,272
<i>Ever since Dad died,</i>

221
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,023
<i>it's hard to smile.</i>

222
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,525
<i>The truth is, I can't remember</i>

223
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,026
<i>when the last time was that I laughed.</i>

224
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,820
You just gave me a new life goal…

225
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,447
to make you smile.

226
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,827
Welcome to our home.

227
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:28,664
First commandment

228
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,082
of Golden Palacios,

229
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,877
Thou shall not steal my gold

230
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:36,130
because the punishment is death.

231
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:45,347
Sam, don't think about anything

232
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,017
so you and the baby won't be stressed.

233
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,603
Forget about Auntie Aurora.

234
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,356
Just think about happy thoughts, okay?

235
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,905
That's special.

236
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,283
I've looked everywhere
just to look for that.

237
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:08,579
Special?

238
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,497
Yeah.

239
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:21,842
See?

240
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,261
I told you it was special.

241
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:25,888
Let me.

242
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,234
Marry me.

243
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,121
Isn't it too fast?

244
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,667
I mean, we've only been dating
for three months.

245
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,044
We're okay with our setup.

246
00:13:57,628 --> 00:14:00,256
Okay, yeah. I understand.

247
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:01,715
I just thought…

248
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,050
I like you.

249
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,594
I like you so much.

250
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,471
I don't want…

251
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,848
I just don't want to rush things.

252
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,018
No, no, no.

253
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:14,687
Wait.

254
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,314
She said no.

255
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,525
What's happening?

256
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:20,943
I just prepared something special

257
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,611
just in case you said yes.

258
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,655
Oh, my God. This is so embarrassing.

259
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:28,284
We are getting married.

260
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:31,745
- What?
- Yeah.

261
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,707
Wow.

262
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,420
- Congratulations, Paco.
- Thank you.

263
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:41,338
Sam, welcome to the family.

264
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,715
Thank you.

265
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:50,598
Come on, Aurora.

266
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,891
I know that look.

267
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:54,184
You might as well say it now

268
00:14:54,268 --> 00:14:56,270
if you will object to the marriage,

269
00:14:56,353 --> 00:14:59,064
before it reaches to the actual ceremony.

270
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,191
That's such a cliché.

271
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:11,327
How well do you know this woman, Paco?

272
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,207
Well enough…

273
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,126
to know that she's the woman

274
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:20,794
I want to spend the rest of my life.

275
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,588
I don't think so.

276
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:29,094
I had that woman investigated

277
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,265
and the things I've read shocked me.

278
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,064
As a woman, as a mother.

279
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,828
What do you want to say?

280
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,288
Why don't you say it directly to me?

281
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,624
Well, for starters,

282
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:02,795
Sam's mother had an illicit affair.

283
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,798
Do you want to know who, Paco?

284
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:15,849
Is that true, Sam?

285
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:27,778
No.

286
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:31,699
Because my mother was raped.

287
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,793
Who gave you this information?

288
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,796
They should've given you correct details.

289
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:48,382
They should've done a fact check first.

290
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,305
Yes, a lot of bad things
happened to my family,

291
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,307
but who is flawless?

292
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:58,934
Who has no secrets?

293
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,228
How about you, Ma'am Aurora?

294
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,606
Don't you have a secret?

295
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,401
Didn't you step on someone?

296
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,653
Did you oppress someone?

297
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,739
This is not about me.

298
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:16,326
This about you
and your family's immorality.

299
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,890
Sam, you haven't known
each other for a year,

300
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,099
and you said yes already?

301
00:17:41,727 --> 00:17:43,145
Francis…

302
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,731
I love Paco.

303
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,317
And while I get to know him,

304
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,320
I discover how good of a person he is.

305
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:54,031
He is principled

306
00:17:56,158 --> 00:17:58,285
and he makes me smile.

307
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,453
It's like…

308
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,998
he brought the smile back to my face.

309
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,965
How about Mother? What did she say?

310
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,053
Nothing. She asked me if I love him

311
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,721
and I said yes.

312
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:19,765
She said that's the only important thing.

313
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,643
As for me,

314
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:25,479
I hope you'll get
to know each other first.

315
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,023
Of course at the start,

316
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,733
he'll show his best foot forward.

317
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:32,402
Francis, calm down.

318
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:33,529
We won't get married yet.

319
00:18:33,612 --> 00:18:35,572
We're just engaged.

320
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,367
I'm just saying, Sam.

321
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,994
Of course, I don't want him to fool you.

322
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,871
<i>All I care about is you.</i>

323
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,834
<i>I will choose who I want to marry</i>

324
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:48,335
<i>and I choose you.</i>

325
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,881
Just settle with things here.

326
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,467
What's important is
you have something to lie on

327
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:57,094
until you give birth.

328
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:01,932
Thank you, sis.

329
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:04,852
If Paco were here,

330
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,229
he would definitely be happy to see

331
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,815
you helping me and my baby.

332
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,652
There will be a change

333
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:15,654
in your positions in the company.

334
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,781
Of course, Paco here,

335
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:20,951
now that he's finished his MBA,

336
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:24,872
he'll be taking over
the COO position from Galvan.

337
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,375
While Galvan, will be
transferring to Finance.

338
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,294
- What?
- I'm just a consultant?

339
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,129
I'm the OIC.

340
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,047
On the way to becoming a director.

341
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,842
Basil, you took a break,

342
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:39,761
so you need to reorient yourself again

343
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,930
for what happened in the company

344
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:43,724
while you were gone.

345
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,019
This is unfair.

346
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,105
You're taking this personally
because of the fight between Paco and me.

347
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:52,482
When in fact,
I'm more capable than your son.

348
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,029
Hey, I have nothing to do with that.

349
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,697
That was Mom's decision.

350
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,574
You don't deserve to be COO.

351
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,617
I do.

352
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,410
I am the future of this company, not you.

353
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:05,370
That's it? You better watch
your mouth, Basil.

354
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:06,997
I won't watch my mouth, you nepo baby.

355
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,498
What's your problem?

356
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,167
You're my problem.

357
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,710
What? Come on.

358
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,503
He's capable? Why now?

359
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:16,131
- What why now?
- Why without asking me?

360
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,467
Why do I have to ask you, Galvan?

361
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,262
What? It's true.

362
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,347
You shut up, Paco.

363
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,142
See?

364
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,312
I don't even have to do anything
to make you suffer.

365
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,315
- Welcome to your own hell, Sam.
- You should have told me.

366
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,984
It's fun being a Palacios, isn't it?

367
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,823
- I'm the CEO. I run the estate.
- Sam.

368
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:45,035
- I run our company.
- Are you okay? Are you hurt?

369
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,828
Do you know how to run the…

370
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,373
- Dad, say something!
- Are you okay?

371
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,208
Why don't you want
to contradict your sister?

372
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,459
- You're the elder brother.
- Shut up!

373
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,044
- You're the one who…
- You shut up, Paco.

374
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,254
You shut up, Basil.

375
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:00,425
Who?

376
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,345
Which one of you pushed Sam?

377
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,400
What?

378
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,361
Who?

379
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,198
No one will answer? Okay.

380
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,909
What?

381
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,828
Answer me.

382
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,204
Who hurt Sam?

383
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:40,841
What?

384
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:43,260
Answer me.

385
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:57,983
- Who?
- Son.

386
00:21:58,775 --> 00:21:59,735
Paco.

387
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:01,695
That's enough.

388
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,616
If Sam gets hurt one more time

389
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:08,327
because of all of you,

390
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,288
I will kill all of you.

391
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,503
Did you hear me? I'll kill you.

392
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,930
I came as soon as I could.

393
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,515
What happened?

394
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,225
It's okay.

395
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,144
The doctor said
it was an effect of his chemo.

396
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:36,730
He had a little IV today,

397
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,523
but he'll be discharged later.

398
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:41,443
But, he needs bed rest for a week. See?

399
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,904
Don't you feel anything else?

400
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,490
Because if you want,

401
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,241
we can get a second opinion on this.

402
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:50,327
I have some doctor friends.

403
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,704
They're all great.

404
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,958
Sam just said it, right? I'm fine.

405
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,169
Sam, why did you make him follow you here?

406
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,840
Don't talk to
your brother-in-law like that.

407
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,968
I'm sorry, okay? He's just sick.

408
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,847
Even if Francis isn't sick,

409
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:12,099
he's a snob.

410
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,896
Just let me know if you need anything,

411
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:19,523
be it food or medicine.

412
00:23:20,398 --> 00:23:21,817
Just tell me.

413
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,527
I'll take care of your bills.

414
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,073
Actually, I thought

415
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:31,159
maybe we could get Francis a private nurse

416
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,411
to take care of him 24/7

417
00:23:33,495 --> 00:23:36,164
because Santiago is far from Manila.

418
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,458
I wouldn't be at peace
if they go back and forth

419
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,210
to the hospital without me.

420
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:41,503
Right.

421
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,463
Why don't they just stay at home?

422
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,966
I mean, we have a big house.

423
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,467
There's only a few of us there.

424
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,469
And I'm sure you would be happy
to have them around.

425
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,097
Isn't Ruth there?

426
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,850
Yeah, but it's a big compound.

427
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,519
It's just me, Sam, Mom,

428
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:00,313
and Rebecca living in the house.

429
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:04,276
George, on the other hand,
stays on the other side.

430
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:08,071
And if worse comes to worst,
I'll handle them.

431
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,993
It's okay for me.

432
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:16,037
Really?

433
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:17,914
Yes.

434
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,333
Even though you were being mean
to Paco earlier?

435
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:24,212
Sam, I'm not the only one
who needs to be watched.

436
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,130
You too.

437
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,798
I need to make sure

438
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:29,217
that your husband's family
doesn't treat you badly.

439
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:36,433
Come in, come in.

440
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,934
Thank you.

441
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,103
Come in.

442
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,325
Mom…

443
00:24:54,117 --> 00:24:54,993
Wow…

444
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,413
It's beautiful.

445
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,707
Thank you for destroying nature.

446
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,625
Francis.

447
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,876
Come here.

448
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,463
Thank you, Son.

449
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:14,512
Mom, this is my family…

450
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,098
My Mother, Mercy, and my brother, Francis.

451
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:18,475
This is Mom Aurora.

452
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,229
So, you're Sam's family.

453
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:23,313
Good morning.

454
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,649
I have a gift for you, my in-law.

455
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:26,775
That's delicious.

456
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,157
Ma'am.

457
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:37,786
I prefer you to call me
"Ma'am Aurora", not in-law.

458
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:46,544
All right.

459
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,837
Okay, ma'am.

460
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:49,673
You know the rules, Sam.

461
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,094
You are permitted
to roam around the common area,

462
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,514
but the third floor is exclusive to me.

463
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,602
Yes, Mom.

464
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:05,605
Thank you for welcoming my family.

465
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:06,815
Oh, don't thank me.

466
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:08,984
Thank your husband.

467
00:26:09,818 --> 00:26:11,403
This was all his plan.

468
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,071
Because if I had it my way,

469
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,032
I'd prefer not to turn my house

470
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,659
into an evacuation center.

471
00:26:17,742 --> 00:26:19,911
Now, if you'll excuse me…

472
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,957
I'll just feed my dogs.

473
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,000
Thank you for this.

474
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,074
You need professional help.

475
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,120
To fix our marriage,

476
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:04,789
I also want marriage counseling

477
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,750
to address your problem,

478
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,003
our problem.

479
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,419
Paco loved everyone. Not just me,

480
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,964
but my family too.

481
00:27:57,801 --> 00:28:00,220
That's how it should be.

482
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,765
The person we love must fight for us.

483
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:12,357
Are you okay? Are you comfortable?

484
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,443
If you want to change positions,
we'll fix it, okay?

485
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:18,154
Just think happy thoughts for now.

486
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,031
Just relax.

487
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,439
Sam, why?

488
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,401
Nothing.

489
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,697
I remember my last moments with Paco.

490
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,037
I thought…

491
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,831
I thought everything would be fine.

492
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,168
But, it turned out to be the opposite.

493
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,078
Hon…

494
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,122
I've found our marriage counselor.

495
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:38,086
Hon…

496
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,673
Is there something wrong?

497
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,179
Did you and my father, Dr. Orly Castillo,

498
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,933
became close?

499
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:53,601
No.

500
00:30:54,644 --> 00:30:56,729
I just know him.

501
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,107
Anyway, I'll schedule

502
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,818
our first session, so that…

503
00:31:04,237 --> 00:31:05,947
What did you do to my father?

504
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:10,076
What?

505
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,290
Did you have anything
to do with his death?

506
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:30,930
I thought we were okay?

507
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:33,558
Why are you bringing up
the death of Dr. Orly?

508
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,227
I'm just asking you a question.

509
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,645
You're accusing me.

510
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,272
Then answer me.

511
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,648
No.

512
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:44,319
No, I had nothing
to do with Doc Orly's death.

513
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,486
He committed suicide.

514
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,489
He didn't commit suicide. He was killed.

515
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:50,658
And you think I did it?

516
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,412
Why the hell would you think that?

517
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:57,165
Because I heard your mother
and your uncle.

518
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,042
Your mother covered up for you

519
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:00,501
for what you did to my father.

520
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:01,586
What?

521
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,588
What does that mean?

522
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:04,505
Tell me.

523
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,925
Did you kill my father?

524
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,384
- Sam, no, no.
- Did you kill him?

525
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:10,386
Admit it. Did you kill my father?

526
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,180
- You killed him.
- No, no, no.!

527
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:13,765
I'm not a murderer.

528
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,768
I did not kill him.

529
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:18,686
I said, no.

530
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,521
What do you think of me?

531
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,607
I did not kill him.

532
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,361
I've been nothing but honest with you.

533
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,655
Why do you think of me like that?

534
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:30,990
What now?

535
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:46,464
Sam, please…

536
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:48,591
Please, Sam…

537
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,930
You lied to me.

538
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:56,766
Hon, no, no. Not this time.

539
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,059
I'm telling you the truth this time.

540
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,478
Please, don't do this to us. Please.

541
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:02,939
Promise. please, Sam.

542
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:04,565
I am telling you the truth.

543
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,443
Hon, please. Hon.

544
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:10,571
No, don't do this. Sam.

545
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,622
Tell me the truth.

546
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,125
I did not kill Doc Orly.

547
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:23,418
No one did.

548
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:26,045
Because your father killed himself.

549
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:30,675
I gave you a chance to explain yourself.

550
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,634
- Sam…
- But you just wasted the chance.

551
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,262
Sam, you don't know your father.

552
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:36,347
He took advantage of the miners.

553
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:41,269
He extorted money from them just
to sustain his own addiction.

554
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,480
You're so shameless.

555
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,607
Just to defend yourself,

556
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,401
you're going to ruin my father's memory?

557
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:51,404
- You're so shameless.
- Sam, I'm telling the truth.

558
00:33:51,904 --> 00:33:53,823
Your father was a bad person.

559
00:33:53,906 --> 00:33:55,742
He was hiding so much from you.

560
00:33:55,825 --> 00:33:56,951
He was a fool and a liar.

561
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,953
You're the liar, you and your mother.

562
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:01,247
- Sam.
- You. You're the liar.

563
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,540
Your family is hiding so much.

564
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,250
Sam, don't turn the tables on us.

565
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,169
I don't need to turn the tables on you.

566
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,213
I know what I heard.

567
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,926
Yes, your mom has been
protecting you for a long time.

568
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,720
Your family has been covering
you up for a long time.

569
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,974
You killed Dad.

570
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,068
No…

571
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,533
Sam…

572
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,499
Sam…

573
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:49,962
I know everything I need to know from you.

574
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,839
- We're done.
- Sam, no.

575
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:52,799
Sam, no.

576
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,217
- Sam. Sam, no.
- Let me go…

577
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,969
I can't take you to the police now

578
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,596
because I don't have evidence,

579
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,807
but I'll spread this
to the press, to social media.

580
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:01,808
- I'll ruin you.
- Don't do that.

581
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,476
Okay, I'll kill myself.

582
00:35:03,559 --> 00:35:05,186
- Okay, I'll kill myself here.
- Kill yourself, go ahead.

583
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,646
I don't care.

584
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:08,064
You don't believe me?

585
00:35:08,147 --> 00:35:09,941
I'll show you. I'm doing this.

586
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:11,692
I'll jump and I'll take you with me.

587
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,945
- Go ahead.
- Let me go.

588
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:38,427
George…

589
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,556
I'm scared.

590
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:47,228
I'm scared.

591
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:54,277
I don't know how I'm going
to raise our son.

592
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,736
What if he asks

593
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,115
how his father fell off the cliff?

594
00:35:59,198 --> 00:36:01,742
I don't know how I'm going to answer him.

595
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,954
<i>You don't have to worry</i>
<i>about that anymore, Samantha.</i>

596
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,914
<i>Because when the baby comes out,</i>

597
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,666
<i>you won't see him anymore.</i>

598
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:10,918
<i>We're going to a very faraway place.</i>

599
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:21,637
George…

600
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,017
George, why?

601
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,104
What? Just…

602
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:33,691
don't think like that for now.

603
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,568
The important thing now

604
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,862
is for you to deliver the baby safely.

605
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:44,160
My God…

606
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,746
My God…

607
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,539
My God, help us.

608
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,459
Help us.

609
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:52,960
Help us.

610
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:59,133
<i>Finally, son, we'll meet.</i>

611
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,135
<i>We'll finally meet.</i>

612
00:37:03,638 --> 00:37:04,555
Sam…

613
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:08,309
<i>Forgive me, Lord,</i>

614
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,645
<i>for my evil plan against Sam.</i>

615
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,731
<i>Lord, forgive me, please.</i>

616
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,275
Stop crying, baby.

617
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:18,903
Baby Gilbert, stop crying.

618
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:20,071
Please stop crying.

619
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,658
Who else did
the two Mrs. Palacioses talk to?

620
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,994
It's Mom. George called her.

621
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,663
George?

622
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,250
