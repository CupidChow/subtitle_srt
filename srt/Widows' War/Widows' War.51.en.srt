1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,181
<i>Why are you following me?</i>

2
00:00:15,265 --> 00:00:16,933
Are you her accomplice in poisoning Basil?

3
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,977
I did not kill Basil.

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,729
Who is the mastermind, Iñigo?

5
00:00:21,479 --> 00:00:23,523
<i>‪-Time of death?</i>
<i>‪-1:45, Doc.</i>

6
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:25,442
<i>‪I'm so sorry, Sam. Sorry for your loss.</i>

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,569
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,946
Why is he still pretending
that he can't walk?

9
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,489
I know who did that.

10
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:32,782
It's Aurora.

11
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,117
You killed him.

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,911
And why would I kill my own blood?

13
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:38,788
Because you want you and your grandchild

14
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,081
to be the only Palacios left.

15
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:42,333
<i>You also saw the Palacios killer?</i>

16
00:00:42,417 --> 00:00:44,043
<i>Yes, just like the one who attacked you,</i>

17
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,129
he was wearing a vintage gas mask.

18
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:49,382
<i>You're so shameless</i>
<i>to have me investigated.</i>

19
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>Tell my brother</i>

20
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,302
that it wasn't you who killed him.

21
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,762
Tell him!

22
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,056
<i>‪I'm going to kill Samantha, Barry.</i>

23
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,642
‪Patience, my dear Auro.

24
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,479
Your grandchild is yet to be born.

25
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:03,563
‪Why kill her now?

26
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:05,023
<i>I wonder who that woman is</i>

27
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:06,941
<i>and why she wants to help me.</i>

28
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,778
<i>The Palacios Mining Museum</i>
<i>was burned down in 1996.</i>

29
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,946
<i>That was given to Ms. Samantha</i>

30
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,364
<i>before Mr. Castillo's burial.</i>

31
00:01:13,448 --> 00:01:15,533
This is the old Palacios Mining museum.

32
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:19,913
This is one of the things
the group of Manuella Gamboa burned

33
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:22,207
when they went on a strike in 1996.

34
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,541
<i>We have a search warrant</i>

35
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,335
‪to search Mr. Palacios' house.

36
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:26,544
Hey, call the attorney.

37
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:27,962
This is prohibited, Sergeant Royales.

38
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:29,172
‪I said, get out my room.

39
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:33,009
That's the mask of the Palacios killer.

40
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,428
It seems what Mom Aurora said was true.

41
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,472
That the museum got burned down in 1996.

42
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,681
Look at the picture of the museum

43
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,225
<i>compared to the picture of Mom Aurora.</i>

44
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,310
<i>It seems like it was taken here at home.</i>

45
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:49,275
- Samantha. Jericho. Get out of here.
- Sam.

46
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:51,653
- I said get out of here.
- You fool.

47
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,238
- Get out of here!
- Is this the one?

48
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:54,697
Is this the one you said
that got burned down?

49
00:01:54,781 --> 00:01:55,865
Is this the one?

50
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,701
You killed my brother, you animal.

51
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,286
Animal.

52
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,333
Dad, what's the meaning of this?

53
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,753
‪Everybody…

54
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,046
‪out.

55
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,464
‪Except for Mr. Palacios.

56
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:16,386
‪Everybody… out.

57
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:26,646
Sir Galvan…

58
00:02:28,022 --> 00:02:29,816
‪I'm all right, Cairo.

59
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,500
Get out of here.
Amando, get them out of here.

60
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,294
- Animal.
- Guards!

61
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,921
- Don't meddle here.
- Ma'am.

62
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,798
Don't come near
if you don't want to be involved.

63
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,258
Don't come near.

64
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,512
Animal, what are you doing?

65
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,891
Stop that. What are you going to do?
Who are you calling?

66
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:07,729
‪Ms. Amanda.

67
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,897
<i>Sergeant Tupaz, I was right.</i>

68
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,690
<i>The equipment is here.</i>

69
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,400
<i>The gas masks are here.</i>

70
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:14,277
<i>Help us. They are harassing us.</i>

71
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,528
<i>They want to throw us out.</i>

72
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,071
<i>Please come here.</i>

73
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,490
Okay, Ms. Samantha, I'm on my way.

74
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,577
All right, take charge of that.

75
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:27,373
Did they find masks in Aurora's house?

76
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,500
‪Sergeant Tupaz can handle it.

77
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,879
Let's focus on the gas mask in your room.

78
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,006
Why is it here?

79
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:41,137
I just saw it
in the estate before the fire.

80
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,765
‪I was supposed to show it to George.

81
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,391
‪And ask her if…

82
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:48,561
that was what
the Palacios killer was wearing

83
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,230
when she was attacked.

84
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:52,148
‪Then the fire happened.

85
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,525
And I got injured.

86
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,069
I didn't know what happened.

87
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:58,947
I didn't know that I brought it here.

88
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,825
You brought this to your room
and you don't remember?

89
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,911
‪For God's sake, Royales.

90
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:06,955
‪I'm on medication.

91
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,415
‪I take a lot of painkillers.

92
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:11,167
‪I tend to forget things.

93
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,881
‪Don't look at me like that.

94
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:19,467
Sam just said

95
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:22,095
they found masks in Aurora's house.

96
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,891
I'm innocent.

97
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:29,060
I'm not involved in the killings.

98
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,729
I didn't run Francis over.

99
00:04:33,815 --> 00:04:34,899
‪Look at my leg.

100
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:36,109
‪How can I?

101
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:39,487
If there's someone
the Castillos fought with,

102
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,659
it's Aurora. You should investigate her,
not me.

103
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:51,416
There you go.
Sir Galvan betrayed Ma'am Aurora.

104
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:05,096
Samantha, I said stop it.
Don't touch them.

105
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:06,389
Here are the gas masks.

106
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:08,141
Which one did you use

107
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:09,684
to kill my brother?

108
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:10,893
‪None.

109
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,688
Because I have nothing to do
with what happened to Francis.

110
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:15,690
‪God, Samantha.

111
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:18,484
What's with you?
Don't you get tired of accusing me?

112
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:19,736
And don't you get tired of denying it?

113
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,903
It's already here.

114
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,697
You're already caught
and you're still denying it.

115
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,532
You fool.

116
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:33,958
Call the crime lab.

117
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,460
Tell them we'll be sending a gas mask

118
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,420
‪for DNA and fingerprint samples.

119
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,297
‪-Yes, sir.
‪-Let's go.

120
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:55,772
Sergeant Royales, they also found
gas masks here. Five.

121
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:57,565
‪What?

122
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:00,526
‪Is that all?

123
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:03,821
That's eight in total.

124
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,700
There are three missing.

125
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:10,870
Wait…

126
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,290
It's Dad, me,

127
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:17,085
Rodolfo, and Galvan…

128
00:06:17,168 --> 00:06:19,754
We're the only ones
who knew about this secret room.

129
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:25,510
Only one person could get
the missing gas mask.

130
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,386
It's Galvan…

131
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,389
A gas mask like this
was found in his room.

132
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:34,769
‪It must be him.

133
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,358
Galvan is the Palacios killer?

134
00:06:41,651 --> 00:06:43,402
He is also the mastermind?

135
00:06:59,043 --> 00:06:59,877
‪Was it you, Dad?

136
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,713
Were you the masked killer

137
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,507
who attacked me in the estate before?

138
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:05,591
George…

139
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,386
What are you talking about?

140
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:09,637
‪Why would I attack you?

141
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,639
You're carrying my grandchild.

142
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,350
‪This family is crazy.

143
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,062
I don't know what kind
of monsters are living here.

144
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,647
‪-So, answer me.
‪-No.

145
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,108
I wouldn't do that to you

146
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:23,609
and my grandchild.

147
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,362
How about my brother?

148
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,239
Did you kill my brother?

149
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,867
Did you run Francis over?

150
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:55,975
‪Madam.

151
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,896
I don't want to ask this…

152
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,608
but the night…

153
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,612
when someone ran Francis over…

154
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:16,496
I don't want you to fail.

155
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,790
I want you to do your job well.

156
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,920
I will not pay five million pesos

157
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,254
‪for a sloppy job.

158
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,423
‪Good.

159
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:29,717
Update me right away.

160
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,642
Maybe someone else heard you.

161
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,185
And will use that against you.

162
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:40,770
Amando…

163
00:08:42,146 --> 00:08:44,982
‪I was talking to an artist that time…

164
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,902
and not a hired killer.

165
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,073
He is Arsenio Ysrael,

166
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:54,408
‪a very famous sculptor.

167
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:58,371
I was commissioning
a sculpted bust of Paco.

168
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,248
Amando…

169
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,751
I want to see my son every day…

170
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,839
even if it's just a bust

171
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,635
because I long for him.

172
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:14,554
‪Look.

173
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:19,767
‪Here.

174
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,062
These are my options.

175
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,947
Amando…

176
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:36,117
‪What's wrong?

177
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,911
Why do you look that way?

178
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,548
You too.

179
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,342
Why would I kill Francis?

180
00:09:54,635 --> 00:09:55,803
I don't know.

181
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,889
Maybe you and your sister are the same.

182
00:09:58,973 --> 00:10:01,601
They found gas masks with both of you.

183
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,311
‪Wait…

184
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,228
‪Sam.

185
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:08,107
You found a gas mask
in Auntie Aurora's house?

186
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,859
Yes, George.

187
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,154
The person who killed Francis
may be the same person

188
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,822
as the one who tried to kill you.

189
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,073
‪Sam!

190
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,034
‪Look at me.

191
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,162
‪I'm stuck in this wheelchair.

192
00:10:21,746 --> 00:10:24,832
How could I run over your brother?

193
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,338
You're able to stand now, Sir Galvan.

194
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:38,054
I saw you.

195
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,598
You can now walk.

196
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,268
So that means you can also drive.

197
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:57,365
‪Sorry, madam.

198
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,702
I'm happy that they won't find
evidence against you.

199
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,583
I suddenly miss Paco…

200
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,627
Sir Paco.

201
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:13,422
‪Shut up, Amando.

202
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,259
What we talked about before is very clear.

203
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:19,929
No one must know.

204
00:11:20,012 --> 00:11:26,477
‪So, whatever… you feel about me son,
‪keep it to yourself.

205
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,331
What lies about Galvan

206
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,083
are you talking about, Ruth?

207
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,585
I am not telling a lie.

208
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:53,170
I really saw Sir Galvan.

209
00:11:53,254 --> 00:11:55,631
But I didn't say anything because…

210
00:11:57,633 --> 00:11:58,926
I didn't say it right away,

211
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,512
because I don't want us to be in trouble.

212
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:04,807
We're getting along with Sir Galvan.

213
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:07,518
I don't want our relationship
to be strained.

214
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,978
But I didn't think

215
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,440
that maybe what I discovered

216
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:14,150
was connected to the killings.

217
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:16,485
You're always a slut, Ruth.

218
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,862
You're such a liar.

219
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,864
Why are you lying about Galvan?

220
00:12:19,947 --> 00:12:21,866
- Stop it. That's enough.
- Don't you dare touch Galvan.

221
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,702
Even if I've already changed,
I will fight with you.

222
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,537
- Stop it, please.
- Enough!

223
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,539
Stop it.

224
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:32,251
‪Bam.

225
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:33,752
‪Bam.

226
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,131
‪Bang.

227
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:39,300
‪Hello, Auro.

228
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,261
‪Long time no see, my friend.

229
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,346
‪Barry.

230
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,639
‪Sexy devil.

231
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:48,601
- How are you?
- Auro, I missed you.

232
00:12:50,644 --> 00:12:52,229
How did you get in here?

233
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,317
Through the door.

234
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,695
We have strict security here.

235
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:02,948
Auro…

236
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:06,744
‪I don't like to be questioned
‪by your… <i>‪fatoru.</i>

237
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:11,999
‪That's you, old man.

238
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:13,542
<i>‪Fatoru.</i>

239
00:13:14,084 --> 00:13:15,669
So you know what that means,

240
00:13:15,753 --> 00:13:17,922
it's a servant.

241
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:20,591
Helper.

242
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,346
Amando, just leave us first.

243
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:29,058
Simon, wait for me in the car.

244
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:34,063
- Sit down, my dear Barry.
- Thank you.

245
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,272
Did you like my entrance?

246
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,649
Of course.

247
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,108
Actually, I saw the shotgun over there.

248
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,193
It's beautiful.

249
00:13:39,276 --> 00:13:40,444
Can I have it?

250
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:46,367
‪Of course. You can have
‪anything you want from my house, my dear.

251
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,536
Wow…

252
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:49,453
‪So…

253
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:57,461
How did you get through
the security, Barry?

254
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,004
‪Well…

255
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,506
‪I have my ways.

256
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,093
‪You know, I can be charming if I want to.

257
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,929
‪So, how are you? What's happening?

258
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,347
‪Oh…

259
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,933
‪that whore of a daughter-in-law,

260
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,643
she still hasn't stopped.

261
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:15,646
‪Well… I must admit…

262
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:19,567
‪I didn't know her game plan.

263
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,570
‪But it's becoming dangerous, Barry.

264
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:23,988
‪What do you mean?

265
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:27,491
‪Someone was helping her.

266
00:14:29,535 --> 00:14:31,287
Someone sent her my picture

267
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,789
‪that led to the discovery

268
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:37,084
of gas masks in the secret room.

269
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:40,963
‪Oh, my God.

270
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,506
‪That's so scary.

271
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:53,642
Your mother…

272
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,852
- Don't you dare…
- Mom.

273
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:56,562
Stop bothering Galvan.

274
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:02,860
Yes!

275
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,033
I can stand and walk

276
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:10,826
because I'm in therapy.

277
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,785
‪You all know that.

278
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,705
But I can't do it for a long time

279
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,750
because I'm not yet fully healed.

280
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:21,211
That's why, Ruth. Stop it.

281
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:23,797
‪And you, George.

282
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:25,799
‪You disappoint me.

283
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,553
You saw me grieve

284
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,889
when my grandson with Beverly died.

285
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,017
And you think I'd kill
my grandson with you?

286
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,604
And you, Sam.

287
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:41,607
Don't involve me in
your fight with Aurora.

288
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,859
I don't care about your brother.

289
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,863
You better be telling the truth, Dad

290
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,283
because Sam and I will not stop

291
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,577
until we find out who,
between you and Aurora,

292
00:15:53,661 --> 00:15:56,413
was behind all the killings
here on the estate.

293
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:58,916
‪So…

294
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:03,295
you are both allies now?

295
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:05,172
‪Well…

296
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,550
‪you will fail
‪to incriminate me in any crime.

297
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,012
Because I am innocent.

298
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,307
Cairo.

299
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,877
‪Auro…

300
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:45,421
‪I'm so worried for you.

301
00:16:46,422 --> 00:16:48,340
What if your daughter-in-law

302
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,175
can prove what you did to her brother?

303
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,970
‪Wait, Barry.

304
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,015
‪You think…

305
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,224
‪I'm guilty?

306
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,435
‪I'm not.

307
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,771
Auro…

308
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,108
Would you lie to me?

309
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,111
‪You know you can tell me anything.

310
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,449
‪I can help you get away with… anything.

311
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,743
‪You know, my boyfriend…

312
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:19,663
‪he's the best lawyer in town.

313
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:22,583
Is it Attorney Morris?

314
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,670
And he's not just any other lawyer.

315
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,632
‪He's practically… a magician.

316
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,093
‪He can work his tricks…

317
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:37,765
so no one goes to jail.

318
00:17:38,515 --> 00:17:41,852
‪That's why, tell me everything,
‪so that I can help you.

319
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:43,270
‪Come on…

320
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:44,855
‪spill.

321
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:52,279
‪Cheers.

322
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:03,248
I instructed that
the fingerprints and DNA testing

323
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,627
we sent to the crime lab be rushed.

324
00:18:07,711 --> 00:18:09,088
Is there a result from the forensic teams

325
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,132
for the evidence that you sent?

326
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:14,176
‪Based on the ballistics report

327
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,346
the bullet that was found in
Attorney Morales' body

328
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,389
was fired from a GLOCK 19.

329
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,059
The tire marks

330
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:23,477
from the crime scene

331
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,104
didn't match the skid marks
outside the church

332
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,564
where Francis was run over.

333
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,943
The skid marks have
an unidentifiable pattern.

334
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:33,612
How about the cars
in the Palacios compound?

335
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,405
Has your team checked them out yet?

336
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,993
There was no match with the tire marks

337
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:42,621
owned by the Palacios.

338
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,998
Sarge.

339
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:50,420
What Mrs. Aurora Palacios said is true.

340
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:52,256
There's an inventory
of all the mining equipment

341
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,590
in the basement.

342
00:18:57,845 --> 00:18:58,971
Okay, sir.

343
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:01,890
So, there are three missing.

344
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,434
It's possible that Mr. Palacios took them?

345
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,104
But we only recovered one.

346
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,438
Where are the other two?

347
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,340
‪Except for the GLOCK 19…

348
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,260
all evidence leads us to the Palacios.

349
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,596
‪The call traced and the gas mask.

350
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,264
One of the siblings,

351
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,766
Aurora or Galvan, may be the suspect.

352
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,394
Or maybe both.
Maybe they are in connivance.

353
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,812
Maybe they are the mastermind.

354
00:19:58,614 --> 00:19:59,948
Sarge.

355
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,075
Do you have an update on the evidence?

356
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:13,337
What happened?

357
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,092
Jericho, I won't involve you
in the investigation.

358
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:21,386
What?

359
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:25,432
Sarge, we found pieces of evidence.

360
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,601
We will find out who the mastermind is.

361
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,187
Yes, but it's your uncle
and auntie who are involved.

362
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:31,772
‪That's conflict of interest.

363
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,816
I am a soldier.

364
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,526
Family doesn't matter to me in this case.

365
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,570
Whoever is guilty
must be held accountable.

366
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,822
Yes, but you told me several times

367
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:42,366
that you left the military

368
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,867
for the Palacios.

369
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,577
You will do everything for your family.

370
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,037
‪I won't take that risk.

371
00:20:58,548 --> 00:20:59,383
‪Hello?

372
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,531
- What's with you?
- Ouch.

373
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,992
Your hand is so stinky.
It smells like fish.

374
00:21:25,075 --> 00:21:26,118
That hurts.

375
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,537
What now?

376
00:21:29,496 --> 00:21:30,539
What?

377
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,166
Did you tell Ma'am Aurora,
what I texted you?

378
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:37,212
Sir Galvan betrayed Ma'am Aurora.

379
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,765
I just told Madam.

380
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:52,352
How about you?
Did you tell Sir Galvan what I texted you?

381
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,534
Yes, I just told him.

382
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,120
Let's just wait.

383
00:22:10,203 --> 00:22:11,371
- Come on.
- Let's go.

384
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,587
Galvan.

385
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,089
Galvan.

386
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,302
Galvan.

387
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:27,679
Galvan.

388
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,648
‪-Yes, Aurora.
‪-You bastard.

389
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:41,568
You spoke to Sergeant Royales
and tried to pin it on me.

390
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:54,873
One of our in-laws
is behind all these killings, George.

391
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,542
Yes, but why?

392
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,086
They are Palacios.

393
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,546
I don't know.

394
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:02,589
‪But one thing is for sure,

395
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,673
they are demons.

396
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:06,593
It's possible that they are in connivance

397
00:23:06,676 --> 00:23:08,887
or they also have an accomplice.

398
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,811
Amando?

399
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:19,356
You know it's possible

400
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,900
because he is just a minion to Mom Aurora.

401
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,070
It could also be Auntie Vivian.

402
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:27,989
But…

403
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,534
she is also mad at the Palacios.

404
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,120
She would not connive with those siblings.

405
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,788
George, we don't know

406
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,457
how the mind of that woman works.

407
00:23:38,917 --> 00:23:39,918
Well, you have a point.

408
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,799
Sam, we need to help each other.

409
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,553
We need to know
who the real mastermind is.

410
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:50,887
That's the key

411
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,848
to finding out who poisoned Basil.

412
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,017
We really need to help each other, George.

413
00:23:56,935 --> 00:24:00,480
Whoever did this
to Dad and Francis must pay.

414
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,192
Whatever you're planning to do,
I will help out.

415
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:05,694
Really, Mother?

416
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,237
You didn't even tell me

417
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,365
that Dad can already walk.

418
00:24:10,448 --> 00:24:13,076
I already explained why.

419
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,454
You don't want to fight with Dad.

420
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,706
Why, Mom?

421
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,666
Are you scared of being kicked out
or not getting the money

422
00:24:19,749 --> 00:24:21,668
- that you are getting?
- George…

423
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,962
Don't think of me that way.

424
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:30,635
‪I knew it.

425
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:33,221
‪You did actually mean it…

426
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:34,890
‪when you said,

427
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:36,975
let's help and protect each other.

428
00:24:37,058 --> 00:24:38,852
That we're family.

429
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,062
I just turned my back, Galvan.

430
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,940
‪You already threw me under the bus.

431
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:45,275
‪Look who's talking.

432
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,361
You did the same thing to me.

433
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:50,739
You betrayed me to Sergeant Tupaz.

434
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,616
What I said to Sergent Tupaz is,

435
00:24:52,699 --> 00:24:53,825
aside from me,

436
00:24:53,909 --> 00:24:56,536
you're the only one who knew
about the secret room basement.

437
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,289
Which implied that I stole

438
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:02,167
one of the gas masks in there.

439
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:04,127
Isn't that called betrayal?

440
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,254
But, not like what you did.

441
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,465
‪You told Sergeant Royales

442
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:10,467
that I had a motive to kill Francis

443
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,594
because of my altercation with Sam.

444
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,137
That's enough.

445
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,265
‪Madam. Sir.

446
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,143
Why are you
pointing fingers at each other?

447
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,436
Where did you get these accusations

448
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:23,813
you are making against each other?

449
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:32,030
You can't answer?

450
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:36,284
Maybe you understood it wrongly
from the people who told you.

451
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,539
Or maybe they just want you to fight.

452
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,797
Wait, you might end up fighting.

453
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:49,881
Stop that.

454
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,591
George, don't blame Auntie Ruth.

455
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,969
That might lead to something else.

456
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:55,011
Yes.

457
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:57,389
We're all on the same side.

458
00:25:57,472 --> 00:26:00,767
At least I'm volunteering to help…

459
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:02,394
not like Mercy.

460
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,648
Mercy, stop sulking.

461
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:08,858
Our daughters need us.

462
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:10,860
Let's help them.

463
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:13,613
Just let Auntie Mercy be.

464
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:17,575
You know we're veering away
from our main concern.

465
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:19,869
Let's just focus first.

466
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,881
You know, Amando is right.

467
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,927
You're not the enemies here.

468
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,722
It's both your daughters-in-law.

469
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,057
It's them because they are already allies,

470
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,435
while you two are fighting.

471
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,521
‪It's true, Aurora.

472
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,691
George and Sam
are indeed on the same side.

473
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:52,068
Those who used to be mortal enemies,

474
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:53,778
are allies now.

475
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:56,281
And their enemy is us…

476
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,241
The two of us.

477
00:26:59,075 --> 00:27:02,162
Now is the time for you
to help and protect each other.

478
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,873
Because if not, maybe one of you,

479
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:07,167
or both of you, will go to jail.

480
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:20,638
‪I hate to admit it…

481
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,142
‪but he has a point.

482
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:30,023
This is not the right time
for us to fight.

483
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,317
Let's fight some other time, Galvan,

484
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,779
once we've destroyed the little devils

485
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:38,073
that are using our surnames.

486
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:47,123
‪All right, Aurora.

487
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,044
‪From now on, let's work together.

488
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:52,587
‪For real.

489
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,343
Let's be allies.

490
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:03,223
‪I will not allow…

491
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:08,269
these two witches to defeat us, Galvan.

492
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,284
So, what's your plan now?

493
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,413
We need to spy on them, George.

494
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,790
Both Mom Aurora and Uncle Galvan.

495
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:29,958
We need to know

496
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:32,168
what Mom Aurora
and Uncle Galvan's next move is.

497
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,923
‪Yes.

498
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,967
‪We can do this, Sis.

499
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:42,804
‪Sis.

500
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:45,992
Aurora.

501
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:49,496
‪Sorry.

502
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,915
So, you're also following Uncle Galvan.

503
00:29:55,543 --> 00:29:57,504
‪I'm happy that we're working together.

504
00:29:58,213 --> 00:29:59,380
Me too.

505
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:03,551
I'm also following Mom Aurora.

506
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,136
She said she's going somewhere.

507
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,098
There's Auntie Aurora. She's in a hurry.

508
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,108
So, she's meeting Uncle Galvan,

509
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,487
but why are they talking there?

510
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,866
It looks like they're
having a serious conversation.

511
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,841
Come on, let's follow them.

512
00:31:57,081 --> 00:31:58,583
Sam, hurry up. We need to get closer,

513
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:00,376
so we can hear
what they are talking about.

514
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:02,003
Not too close.

515
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:03,546
Hurry.

516
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:04,589
Sam.

517
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:19,812
Ward…

518
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:24,484
What's with you, Ward?

519
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,444
I've been calling you.

520
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,572
You didn't even bother to go down to eat.

521
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:31,240
What's the problem?

522
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,163
What are you hiding?

523
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,414
What's that?

524
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:41,501
Ward…

525
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:46,506
What's that?

526
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:50,593
What's happening to you?

527
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,347
What's this?

528
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,683
Mom…

529
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:06,317
Ward…

530
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,239
What's this thing doing here?

531
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:13,324
Why do you have this?

532
00:33:28,089 --> 00:33:29,882
- Jericho.
- Thank you.

533
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,719
What are you doing here?

534
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:37,640
We're following Mom Aurora
and Uncle Galvan.

535
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:41,602
How about you? What are you doing here?

536
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:48,276
Jericho, tell us.

537
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,902
Are they meeting you?

538
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,447
What? Are you their accomplice?

539
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,074
If I were their accomplice,
I wouldn't have helped you.

540
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,119
Don't think negatively about me.

541
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,581
Yes, Auntie Aurora
and Uncle Galvan are my family,

542
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:03,875
but if they are guilty,
I will hold them accountable.

543
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,295
That's the oath I took as a soldier.

544
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,470
Dad and Auntie Aurora are gone.
They outsmarted us.

545
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:17,889
They haven't gone far yet. Let's go.

546
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,474
Ma'am George, what's with you?

547
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,893
Just go home.

548
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,895
I'll take care
of watching over your in-laws.

549
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,272
We can't.

550
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:28,900
Sam and I agreed

551
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:30,318
that we'd investigate them.

552
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,944
I'll do it.

553
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,237
You'll help me better

554
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,948
if you keep my nephews' lives
away from danger.

555
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:40,536
So please, just follow me, okay?

556
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,879
Mom…

557
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,173
Mom…

558
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,885
What's this thing doing here?

559
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,388
Do you have…

560
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,226
something to do

561
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:04,977
with what happened to Francis?

562
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,563
No, Mom. I just saw it there, Mom.

563
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,983
Those killers are demons.

564
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:12,985
They don't just kill,

565
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:15,530
they also involve my children.

566
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:16,656
Remember?

567
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,616
They did the same thing to George

568
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,868
after they stabbed Beverly.

569
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,496
They placed the knife
inside your sister's bag.

570
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,167
Mom, they're setting me up.

571
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,295
Mom, I don't want to go to jail.

572
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,006
- Mom…
- Ward…

573
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,427
You don't have a motive
for killing Francis.

574
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:40,763
So you shouldn't be scared.

575
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:46,936
Ward…

576
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,605
Ward…

577
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,610
Is there something you're not telling me?

578
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:30,021
Mother…

579
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:31,898
Mother, you're here.

580
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:33,941
I've been looking for you
for some time now.

581
00:36:34,942 --> 00:36:37,028
Mother, I really have a strong hunch

582
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,654
that it's Mom Aurora and Uncle Galvan

583
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:41,073
who have something do to
with Francis' death.

584
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,370
Mother…

585
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:50,833
Mother…

586
00:36:55,421 --> 00:36:56,756
Mother, stop it.

587
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,093
Please stop sulking.

588
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,932
Please don't be like that, Mother.

589
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:12,730
Let's not let what happened when Dad died

590
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:14,357
happen again.

591
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:18,819
You were spaced out. Our house got burned.

592
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,280
We had to live with George.

593
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,533
And then misfortunes happened
in our lives one after the other.

594
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:26,035
Stop it.

595
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:28,663
Are you blaming me

596
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,706
for everything that happened to us?

597
00:37:32,458 --> 00:37:33,876
Mother, no.

598
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:39,131
What I'm saying is be strong, Mother.

599
00:37:39,882 --> 00:37:41,509
Because I need you too.

600
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:43,970
I am still here, Mother.

601
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,766
My baby is still here, your grandchild.

602
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:54,105
All I'm saying is to be brave, Mother.

603
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,816
Maybe if you were brave before

604
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,401
what happened to Dad wouldn't….

605
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:01,320
What?

606
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,865
Maybe your father
wouldn't have fooled around?

607
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,704
Maybe Aurora Palacios
wouldn't have become his mistress?

608
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,122
Is that what you wanted to say?

609
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,211
You're right.

610
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:21,340
A woman's weakness
should not be a reason for her

611
00:38:21,424 --> 00:38:23,217
to be cheated on,

612
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,177
have her husband stolen,

613
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,389
and have her son run over.

614
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,558
I should be…

615
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,685
I should be braver,

616
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:35,521
so that Aurora won't kill

617
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:38,983
what's left of our family.

618
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:46,657
What now, son?

619
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:47,658
Mother…

620
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,452
Ward, Mom…

621
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:52,204
I've been looking
for both of you for a while now.

622
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:55,875
Why do you look that way, Ward?

623
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,463
Mom, what's happening?

624
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,883
What are you holding?

625
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:19,982
What's this?

626
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,943
Why do you have this?

627
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:24,612
Where did you get this?

628
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:26,489
George, no.

629
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:29,033
Someone placed that
inside your brother's cabinet.

630
00:39:29,116 --> 00:39:31,994
He's being framed for Francis' death.

631
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,668
It's time for me
to end Aurora's evil ways.

632
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:41,629
Mother…

633
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:44,548
Mother, why do you have a grenade?
Where did that come from?

634
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:45,925
From Francis' things.

635
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:46,926
I don't know where he got it,

636
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:51,097
but this, this is what I'll use
on Aurora.

637
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,015
Mother… Mother, please. Don't.

638
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,101
Let go of me. I will kill that woman.

639
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,311
Mother, calm down.

640
00:40:04,985 --> 00:40:05,945
Mom…

641
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,863
We need….

642
00:40:08,697 --> 00:40:11,742
We need to surrender this
to Sergeant Royales.

643
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,661
So they can investigate…

644
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,497
who placed this in Ward's things.

645
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,165
George, no.

646
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,543
They might sue your brother.

647
00:40:21,210 --> 00:40:22,753
Why would he be jailed

648
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,923
when the real killer is framing him?

649
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:29,135
And Ward has no motive

650
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,512
to do that to Francis.

651
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,437
George…

652
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:42,982
There is.

653
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,484
What do you mean?

654
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:59,540
George. A few days before Francis died,

655
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,584
we fought.

656
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,627
We got into a fist fight.

657
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:06,505
Ward.

658
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,008
Please tell your mother

659
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,759
to stop gossiping that my sister

660
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,011
is an arsonist.

661
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:13,888
My mother is not a gossip.

662
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,723
What do you want me to call her?

663
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,142
Fake news peddler? Gossipmonger?

664
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,727
Someone with an itchy tongue?

665
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,811
You jerk.

666
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:23,856
What now?

667
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,275
- Let go of me.
- What?

668
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,568
Let go of me.

669
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,111
Sir Francis, stop it.

670
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:31,363
Sir Ward, stop it.

671
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,075
Sir Francis, that's enough.

672
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,827
- What?
- What now?

673
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,246
- What now?
- What's with you? Stop that.

674
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,789
- What? Let go of me!
- Stop it.

675
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,583
I'm not done with that Francis yet.

676
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,959
Come here. Come.

677
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:45,753
- You won't only get that.
- Stop it.

678
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:48,255
I will do the same thing
you did to my father.

679
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,966
I will kill you! I will kill you!

680
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:52,134
What?

681
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:54,345
Do you think I've forgotten about that?

682
00:41:54,428 --> 00:41:57,139
Father had a heart attack because of you.

683
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:01,936
That's why, I'll make sure
you'll pay for that someday.

684
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,479
I will kill you!

685
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:05,189
- I will kill you, Francis!
- That's enough.

686
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:07,858
I will kill you! I will kill you!

687
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:12,530
George, because I was so angry,
I said a lot of nasty things to him.

688
00:42:13,614 --> 00:42:17,826
Cairo and the other staff
heard that, George.

689
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:22,957
George, I threatened his life.

690
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,752
Mother, please don't do that.

691
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,712
I will kill that woman.

692
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:32,049
I will do what she did to your brother.

693
00:42:32,132 --> 00:42:33,676
I will blow her head off.

694
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:35,219
She's an animal.

695
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,137
Mother, Mother, calm down.

696
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,556
I want to seek revenge on them too.

697
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:40,474
But not this way, Mother.

698
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:43,143
Not in a way that we will die.
And you will go on jail.

699
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,520
- Mother, please.
- I don't care

700
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,438
if Aurora and I both die.

701
00:42:46,522 --> 00:42:47,565
Oh, my God.

702
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:50,192
What's important is
that she'll pay for all the things

703
00:42:50,276 --> 00:42:52,736
she did to our family,
and to your father as well.

704
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:56,031
I will blow her soul up!

705
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,449
- Mother. Mother, don't.
- Ma'am, careful.

706
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,410
Please, I'm begging you.

707
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,537
Mother, don't.

708
00:43:02,371 --> 00:43:04,331
Please, calm down.

709
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:07,334
I need you, Mother.

710
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,670
My baby needs you…

711
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,006
your grandchild.

712
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,299
Mother, please.

713
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:15,092
Please, put that down.

714
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:17,219
This is not the right way.

715
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,805
Please, Mother. Listen to me.

716
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,098
Mother, stop it.

717
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:31,692
I recorded all your conniving.

718
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,404
So, before you think of betraying me,

719
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,989
‪I will make sure

720
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:40,784
that you'll be the first to fall.

721
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:43,495
Help me find who framed him.

722
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,664
It's not true that someone framed Ward.

723
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,708
