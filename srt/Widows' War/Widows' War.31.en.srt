1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,802
Sir Galvan is offering a reward
of five million

2
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:55,680
to whoever can discover where Jerico is.

3
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,099
Let's just hope that they
catch Jerico right away

4
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,310
so that finally,
justice can be done for Basil.

5
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,103
- Thank you.
- For what?

6
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:03,313
For being Basil's friend

7
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,689
and now mine.

8
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,107
Jerico, come out!

9
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,943
I promise I will help you,
but just surrender first.

10
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,363
PREVIOUSLY

11
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,538
- What?
- Jerico, don't.

12
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:23,124
<i>When Jerico and I saw each other,</i>

13
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,462
he mentioned to me that his father's body
and Rebecca's ex's body were missing.

14
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,423
I told Jerico that our brother's body
was lost at sea.

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:31,716
What about Rebecca's ex?

16
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,092
He was buried in the mines

17
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,053
and we couldn't retrieve his body.

18
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:37,722
Will you be able to help us
find Ma'am Rebecca or not?

19
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:39,307
Are we not leaving anymore?

20
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:42,310
Maybe not for now, Mother.

21
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,395
I pity Ma'am Aurora.

22
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,399
Playing the hero to Sam was effective.

23
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:50,985
<i>She and her family are no longer leaving.</i>

24
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:55,031
So all is well in the house
of Aurora Palacios?

25
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:56,825
Not really.

26
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,994
It's your troublemaker cousin.

27
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:00,912
Rebecca?

28
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,622
Gosh, let me out.

29
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:04,082
Jerico needs me.

30
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,333
Your brother is a killer.

31
00:02:05,416 --> 00:02:08,586
What's with you? Someone just
placed it among his things!

32
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,381
My brother is innocent.
Jerico is innocent!

33
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,345
The Palacios?

34
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,140
It literally runs through our veins,
the craziness.

35
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,308
One word to describe this family?

36
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:23,268
Crazy.

37
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:25,395
What you're doing to me is illegal.
This is kidnapping!

38
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,772
- Shut up!
- Let's talk.

39
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,274
You're also not convinced
that I'm the killer.

40
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,821
I see blood on your hands.

41
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:38,366
- If that's the case, who is the killer?
- That's what we're going to find out.

42
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,701
- How?
- With your help.

43
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,869
I agree.

44
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,666
It's a good thing I was freed, Mother.

45
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,543
It's not safe. You don't have
anyone with you here.

46
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:51,170
Especially since the police
haven't caught Jerico.

47
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:54,465
You might get worn out from constantly
watching over your sister.

48
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:58,094
Remember, you're still sick.

49
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:01,931
Mother, compared to you and Sam,
this cancer means nothing.

50
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,516
It's nothing!

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,976
Pfft, cancer?

52
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:07,478
Francis, Mother is right.

53
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,149
You should make sure you get well
because my baby will need you.

54
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,984
Of course, Sam. I promise.

55
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:15,236
You and Mother will be spending
a long time with me.

56
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:19,157
Baby, I'll take care of you, don't worry.

57
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,912
Wait, do you want to eat
a delicious snack?

58
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,246
- Make sure it's delicious.
- Yes, okay.

59
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,623
Just wait.

60
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,173
Amazing, Mother.

61
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:38,968
It seems Francis has changed a lot
since he got out of prison.

62
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,929
I don't know,

63
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:43,932
it's like he's become more positive.

64
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,562
Sam,

65
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:54,108
now that Francis has been acquitted,

66
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,110
will you tell him the truth?

67
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,580
About what happened to Paco…

68
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,753
and that he was jailed because of
the morphine that you took?

69
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:19,926
That Basil was blackmailing you
and wanted you to kill George?

70
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,648
Mother, I don't think I should for now.

71
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,569
You saw how happy Francis was.

72
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,823
If he finds out,

73
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:45,827
he might get mad at me

74
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,080
and disown me.

75
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,002
Let's do it some other time.

76
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:11,227
They found a picture of Sir Basil
in Jerico's cabinet.

77
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,271
Jerico is Basil's killer?

78
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:15,231
And maybe Sir Paco's killer too.

79
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,443
They also saw a picture of Sir Paco
marked with an X.

80
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:37,128
Sam?

81
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,464
What are you looking at?

82
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:45,053
Oh my God, Sam.

83
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,847
Why is it like that? Who did that?

84
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:51,392
Will you be targeted next?

85
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:54,604
Hold on.

86
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:59,984
Help! Help!
Someone wants to kill my daughter.

87
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,360
Francis!

88
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,321
Sam…

89
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:08,326
Mother?

90
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:10,119
Mother! Sam!

91
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:11,412
What happened?

92
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,624
Someone left this for Sam.

93
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:15,541
What's this?

94
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,256
What's the meaning of this?

95
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,092
Will the killer target my sister next?

96
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:31,390
Sam, will the killer target you next?

97
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,898
Oh my God.

98
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,234
Francis, Sir Amando,

99
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,820
don't let that happen to Sam.

100
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,446
I'm begging you.

101
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:46,906
Mother, don't worry.

102
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:49,075
I won't let anything bad happen to Sam.

103
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,869
Not even if that killer and I
end up killing each other.

104
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,997
Did you see anyone come in
or go out of your room?

105
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,878
He can't have gone far.
He should still be in the area.

106
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,549
- I will alert the whole estate.
- I'll go with you.

107
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,426
Just stay here.

108
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,596
Keep an eye on your mother and sister.

109
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,308
We don't know
what Jerico's next move will be.

110
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,824
Hello? This is Villa.

111
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:33,035
What?

112
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,165
What is it?

113
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,834
There's trouble
at the Palacios' Estate again.

114
00:07:45,423 --> 00:07:46,549
Sam.

115
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,719
Did you do anything bad to Jerico?

116
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:51,888
Did you do something to him?

117
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,017
I don't know.

118
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,685
I don't know…

119
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:01,105
My God…

120
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:03,900
My God, why am I being targeted?
I don't know what's happening.

121
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,026
I don't know…

122
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:08,112
I don't know why Jerico wants to kill me.
I have no idea.

123
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:09,405
That jerk!

124
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:11,991
Maybe he thinks I'm no match for him.

125
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:14,327
If he dares to show up in front of me,
I will kill him.

126
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:17,538
Francis, you calm down too.

127
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:20,249
Acting that way won't help.

128
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,835
Maybe you will break the law too.

129
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:26,506
So what do you want me to do?
Sit quietly and do nothing?

130
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,300
He's threatening Sam's life,
and you want me to calm down?!

131
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,969
What I want is for us to leave this place!

132
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:34,639
Where will we go, Mother?
To our old house?

133
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:37,099
What if Jerico knows where we live?

134
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:40,394
I don't know!
All I know is it's dangerous here.

135
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,771
Come on, let's go!

136
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,690
But we already made our decision
that we would live here.

137
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:46,901
That this would be our home.

138
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:51,072
This is not our home!
We just live here!

139
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:54,325
A home should be safe.
There shouldn't be any killings.

140
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:56,369
Think of your own safety!

141
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,246
Sam.

142
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,498
Sam, Mother has a point.

143
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:03,793
If something happens to you,
the baby will be affected too.

144
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:07,838
Do you want something bad to happen
to the baby you're carrying?

145
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:23,813
I asked Francis to take the car
out of the garage.

146
00:09:23,896 --> 00:09:25,481
Just bring the important stuff, Sam.

147
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,568
- Yes, Mother. Everything is here.
- Let's leave.

148
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,319
Hurry up, so we can go now.

149
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,114
- You didn't forget anything?
- No, I didn't.

150
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,078
What's the meaning of this?

151
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,497
You're not leaving.

152
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,875
No one will leave this house
without my permission.

153
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,378
Sam,

154
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,755
my grandchild is a Palacios.

155
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,174
Even if that child is not yet born,

156
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:54,760
that child belongs in my house!

157
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,558
Ma, my life is in danger.

158
00:10:00,641 --> 00:10:01,601
Look.

159
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:04,186
Ma, I received a death threat.

160
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,110
Sam,

161
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:16,032
if this is another ploy
so you can leave my house--

162
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,867
Ma, this is real!

163
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:19,243
This is real!

164
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,914
Ma, if you're not scared for my life,

165
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,335
then be scared for my baby.

166
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,463
Because if something bad happens to me,

167
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,132
this baby I'm pregnant with,

168
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,092
Paco's baby and mine,

169
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,636
your grandchild,

170
00:10:37,428 --> 00:10:39,013
will also be gone.

171
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,482
Okay, go.

172
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:55,321
I will agree to let you leave
for a little while.

173
00:10:58,824 --> 00:11:00,034
Thank you, Ma.

174
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,577
But on one condition.

175
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:07,750
You will stay
in one of my houses in Manila.

176
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,465
We have a house.

177
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:18,094
What, Mercy?

178
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,930
Do you have security?

179
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,307
Do you have CCTV around the area?

180
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,017
You don't, right?

181
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,188
My house has all of those.

182
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:32,858
You'll be heavily secured in my property.

183
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:40,199
All right.

184
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:42,701
What's important is

185
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:45,121
that Sam is safe,

186
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,915
and the baby too.

187
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,920
Thank you, Ma.

188
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,382
But once the killer is caught, Sam,

189
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:58,467
you will all return to the estate.

190
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,219
Do we understand each other?

191
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:26,829
Oh, wow.

192
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:28,372
Groceries?

193
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,374
They're for Ma'am Sam.

194
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,251
Really?

195
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:35,129
You're assigned to buying
their groceries now?

196
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,258
Didn't you know?
Their entire family left last night.

197
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,135
Where did they go?

198
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,511
They didn't say.

199
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,638
It was so sudden.

200
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:47,641
And they left their things,
including their clothes.

201
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,101
Even their jewelry?

202
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:51,312
Everything as in everything.

203
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,647
I wasn't able to say goodbye to Ma'am.

204
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:55,941
Rico!

205
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,568
Get back to work.

206
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,694
Yes, sir.

207
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,070
I'll go ahead, ma'am.

208
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,620
And you, Ms. Vivian,

209
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,706
why are you suddenly interested in Sam?

210
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,542
No reason. I was just concerned about her.

211
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:20,674
What of it? We're both part
of the Palacios family.

212
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,301
Sam is a Palacios.

213
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,387
Your daughter, Sofia, is a Palacios.

214
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:26,889
But you're not.

215
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,267
It's basically the same thing.

216
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,311
Where is Sam really?

217
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,438
I still have a lot of things to do.

218
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,398
It would be better if you went home.

219
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,610
You wouldn't want Ma'am Aurora
to see you here.

220
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,160
That old man is so grumpy with me.

221
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,621
I was just asking.

222
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,957
Wait. Sam left.

223
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:55,751
That means no one is looking after
their things,

224
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:59,213
including their jewelry.

225
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:04,009
Vivian, what does that mean?

226
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:07,054
I'm getting sticky fingers.

227
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,224
You're so bad.

228
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,853
This is not suitable
for fingerprint analysis.

229
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,689
A lot of people have touched this already.

230
00:14:17,439 --> 00:14:19,900
But we'll still see what we can do.

231
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:24,113
Detective, only one person
could have done that.

232
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:25,698
Jerico.

233
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,158
He was the one
who threatened Sam last night.

234
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,452
Can we talk to Ms. Samantha?

235
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,745
No.

236
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,205
She's resting.

237
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,584
And you interrogating her
won't achieve anything.

238
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,837
She was traumatized by that threat.

239
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,881
Don't pick on Sam.

240
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,424
Catch Jerico.

241
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,135
He was the one who placed that
in Sam's room.

242
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,761
He is the killer!

243
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,640
It's impossible that Jerico
placed this there.

244
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:53,642
We were with him at the time.
We were interrogating him.

245
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:56,478
Then he has an accomplice.

246
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,983
Believe me, Detective,
Jerico is the killer.

247
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:04,904
The killer's things
were found in his room.

248
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,283
We think they were just placed there
to mess up the investigation

249
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,160
in order to frame him.

250
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,871
My God, you talk too much.

251
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:17,833
If Jerico is not the killer, who is?

252
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:23,088
We still don't know, but we have a theory.

253
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,341
Paco Palacios.

254
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,550
Basil Palacios.

255
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,845
Beverly Maison and her baby.

256
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,889
Peter Pambid.

257
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:33,599
And now, Samantha and her baby.

258
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,809
What do you think all of them
have in common?

259
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:40,105
All of them were living
at the Palacios' Estate.

260
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:44,777
All of them had Palacios blood
or were carrying a Palacios baby.

261
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,655
Except for that scammer, Peter.

262
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,991
What's that song again?

263
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,534
Oh, yes!

264
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,662
"The Great Pretender."

265
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,831
But ma'am, at the time of Peter's death,

266
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:01,168
everyone here at the estate thought
that he was a Palacios.

267
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,255
What's the point?

268
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,175
Just get to the point!

269
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:10,886
Everyone with Palacios blood
is getting killed.

270
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,930
A serial killer is targeting your family.

271
00:16:17,476 --> 00:16:19,186
And that is my point, sir.

272
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,273
The killer wants to kill your family.
All of you.

273
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,693
Do you understand now?

274
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:30,322
Or do you want me to make a diagram
of all the Palacios who were killed

275
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:32,616
to help you understand it, sir?

276
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,792
I don't like your tone.

277
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,294
I don't care
whether you like my tone or not.

278
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,506
I am investigating not one, not two,

279
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:49,258
but three or even more murders!

280
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,969
And your concern is my tone,

281
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,680
not finding out
who is killing your family?!

282
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:58,142
Someone is out to kill us?

283
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,270
And they've already started.

284
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,439
They may continue

285
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,567
until the serial killer
kills your entire family.

286
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,362
Well, they will not succeed.

287
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:15,409
I'm not going to let that
unknown serial killer end this family.

288
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,786
And how will you do that, sir?

289
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,165
How will you stop
an unknown serial killer?

290
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,625
- Are you trying to--
- Galvan!

291
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,961
Will you please stop?

292
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:29,673
But why, Detective?

293
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,551
Why would anyone want to kill us?

294
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:35,262
It could be money.

295
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:37,347
Or it could be someone
who is holding a grudge against you.

296
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:40,642
Can you think of anyone
you've stepped on in the past

297
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,603
who might be seeking revenge now?

298
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,606
But we're Palacios.

299
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:51,570
You can't build an empire
without making a few enemies.

300
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,197
Just a few?

301
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,407
Not just a few.

302
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:58,368
A lot of enemies,

303
00:17:58,452 --> 00:18:03,582
especially when Aurora
started running the company.

304
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:05,834
It doesn't matter.

305
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:11,090
I want this killer found and arrested.

306
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:14,718
They a mistake, messing with our family.

307
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:35,781
George,

308
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,493
don't think about that prediction
Rebecca made.

309
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,495
You know her. She's crazy.

310
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,417
What could be the meaning
of the blood she saw on my hands?

311
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:51,672
Sofia!

312
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,091
Sofia!

313
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,968
- Dad?
- Sofia!

314
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,594
Dad!

315
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,138
Come here.

316
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,434
From now on,
you just stay inside the house.

317
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:05,519
Don't go out.

318
00:19:06,103 --> 00:19:08,689
And tell your nosy friends that
they are banned here for now.

319
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,775
If you need anything, just tell me.

320
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:15,821
I will assign bodyguards for you.

321
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,615
Okay.

322
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,161
Come on.

323
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,538
Sam, pick up, please.

324
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:25,664
Please, pick up.

325
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,417
There's something you need to know.

326
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,127
Oh God.

327
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:43,473
Why, Pa? What's happening?

328
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,436
We just spoke to the investigators.

329
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:52,941
They say the serial killer is targeting
everyone who has Palacios blood.

330
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,193
Oh my God!

331
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:57,321
We all need to be careful,
especially you, George.

332
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,031
You should always have a bodyguard.

333
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:02,618
Sir Galvan, is it okay
if you get my daughter a bodyguard too?

334
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,762
I wonder what she'll tell Sam?

335
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,224
And where is Sam?

336
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:29,144
That's very intriguing.

337
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,873
Didn't you hear me?

338
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,875
Only people with Palacios blood
are being targeted.

339
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,506
The killer won't waste their time on you,
or even George.

340
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,470
I'm just worried for my daughter.

341
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,389
Your daughter will be fine.

342
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:10,185
She's a Palacios by marriage,
but not by blood.

343
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,854
She won't be attacked.

344
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:17,067
Not like Beverly,
who was carrying a Palacios baby.

345
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,860
That's why she was killed.

346
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:20,487
Well, with George…

347
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:30,622
Dad, don't you think
that's a little cruel?

348
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,072
Aurora?

349
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,538
Why did Aurora suddenly disappear?

350
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,834
Aurora, my sister?

351
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,712
"Sister."

352
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,255
She'll get mad.

353
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:24,259
Grandma Aurora?

354
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:27,345
You're really crazy, Vivian.

355
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,723
If she hears you, you're dead.

356
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,099
<i>Ditse?</i>

357
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,352
She's gone.

358
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,313
Where did she go?

359
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:41,985
How did she do it? Magic?

360
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:51,286
Sorry, I'm late, my son.

361
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:55,415
I had to deal with
the investigators first.

362
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:00,420
What was that?

363
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,428
How's my son?

364
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,099
Investigators?

365
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,687
Voices?

366
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,941
What's that?

367
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,361
It's coming from here.

368
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,741
The investigators came again?

369
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,035
What do they want now?

370
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:35,247
The usual.

371
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,374
Theory here and there.

372
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:41,294
But you have nothing to worry about, Paco,

373
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:43,547
because they don't know
anything about you.

374
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,592
I'm not worried about them.

375
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:52,013
I'm worried about Sam.

376
00:23:53,682 --> 00:23:55,767
Why did you let her out of the estate?

377
00:23:56,726 --> 00:24:00,147
Nobody escapes your leash.

378
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,857
I should know.

379
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:06,695
It's better for Sam to be away, Paco.

380
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:09,406
Far from here

381
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,785
so that Sam and your baby
won't get involved in this mess anymore.

382
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,080
But what if she escapes?

383
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:20,625
What if she takes my baby away?

384
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,379
That will never happen.

385
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:26,923
I made sure of that.

386
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,426
Sam may be far away,

387
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:32,721
but, Paco, I can see

388
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,931
every move she makes.

389
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:40,228
I'll brief you about your security.

390
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,062
Dad,

391
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,608
why are you so insensitive to George?

392
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,111
Telling the truth
is not being insensitive.

393
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,239
Come on. Follow me.

394
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,633
George,

395
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:15,847
don't think too much about
what Sir Galvan said.

396
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,724
He's just stressed.

397
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,062
Mother, he's not stressed.

398
00:25:23,063 --> 00:25:25,273
That's really how he sees me.

399
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:29,778
Even if he didn't finish
what he said, I know.

400
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:30,987
Barren.

401
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,907
That's how he sees me.

402
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:39,871
A wife who failed to give
his only son a child.

403
00:25:41,957 --> 00:25:44,084
You know, George,

404
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:49,130
maybe it's a blessing in disguise
that you didn't have a baby.

405
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:52,592
At least you're not the target
of the serial killer.

406
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,095
You are safe, right?

407
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,686
But, Mother, I'd prefer being pregnant.

408
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:10,193
I would have preferred to have
had a child with Basil.

409
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:15,156
So my husband would have left
someone to remember him by.

410
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:21,538
If I were pregnant,
Papa would give me bodyguards.

411
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:27,168
He wouldn't let anything bad
happen to me

412
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,337
or my child.

413
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:30,714
His grandchild.

414
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:35,135
If I'd only gotten pregnant.

415
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:53,403
It's coming from here.

416
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:55,864
Who is that?

417
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,826
Who?

418
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,787
Who is that?

419
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,544
What is that talking?
Where is it coming from?

420
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,132
Where is the talking coming from?

421
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:18,970
I can watch her every move.

422
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,639
I can see all her actions.

423
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,809
I can see every person
who comes in and out.

424
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:29,105
No one can leave me without my permission.

425
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:30,732
Even you.

426
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,944
Did you really think that
I would just let you

427
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:37,781
leave my life just like that, Paco?

428
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,451
I am alive,

429
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,496
but I'm hidden here.

430
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,164
Son,

431
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,958
we've talked about this already, remember?

432
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:52,128
No one can know that you're here.

433
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:56,091
Not now. Not yet.

434
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:58,343
But until when?

435
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:02,263
Until when must I hide here?

436
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,853
I'm excited to see my wife…

437
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,565
and our future baby.

438
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,946
I don't want to be
a prisoner here forever.

439
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,409
You'll be free, Paco,

440
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:24,494
before your baby comes.

441
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:26,996
I promise you that, son.

442
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,834
You will see your baby.

443
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:55,066
Hey.

444
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,818
Why did you come in here?

445
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,028
I'm just returning Ma'am's laptop.

446
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,864
She left it in the car last night.

447
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:03,116
Hurry.

448
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,869
Ma'am Aurora doesn't like
anybody coming in here.

449
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:08,455
Hey, who is this?

450
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,039
Is this Sir Paco?

451
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,207
Yes.

452
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,418
We never met.

453
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,756
Well, he jumped off a cliff.

454
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,300
Too bad. He's handsome.

455
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,384
But that's okay.

456
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,720
There's a new handsome guy
here at the estate.

457
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:24,763
Me!

458
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,140
- Is that okay?
- You?

459
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:28,725
Don't tell me you think it's you.

460
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:33,563
Let's go. Ma'am might catch us here
and push us off the cliff.

461
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:35,273
- Let's go.
- Let's.

462
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:37,609
Hurry up!

463
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,714
Gosh!

464
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:01,841
It's so dusty.

465
00:30:07,430 --> 00:30:08,807
What was that?

466
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,771
Stay here, Paco.

467
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,481
I'll just check outside.

468
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,321
Gosh! I'm having an allergy attack.

469
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:24,739
My God.

470
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:34,916
I'm installing a CCTV camera
facing your door

471
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,586
to make sure that the security team

472
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,173
can see all the people going in
and out of your room.

473
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,471
Are you sure the killer
will not target me?

474
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:54,060
Sofia, nothing bad will happen to you.

475
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:55,937
I promise you that.

476
00:30:56,813 --> 00:30:58,273
After losing Basil,

477
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:05,780
I will not allow that killer to hurt
the next CEO of Palacios Mining.

478
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,782
CEO?

479
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:09,868
Me?

480
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,786
Who else?

481
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:13,705
The unborn baby of Sam?

482
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,041
No. I won't let that happen.

483
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:24,007
This time, the next leader of this family
will come from my line.

484
00:31:25,592 --> 00:31:27,594
And that is you, my daughter.

485
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,097
Ma'am…

486
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,224
Ma'am, let's drink your medicine.

487
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:38,313
You give me one good reason why I should
continue taking my medicine to get well.

488
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:42,901
So you and your brother
can be together for a long time.

489
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,447
Jerico…

490
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:51,534
It's Jerico. Jerico.

491
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,744
Jerico…

492
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,087
Are you okay?

493
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,966
I thought I'd never see you again.

494
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,217
Is that possible?

495
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:10,678
We're siblings. I won't leave you.

496
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:15,892
About what happened last time
in Papa's house…

497
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:18,686
It's okay. You don't have to
worry about it, Jerico.

498
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,355
It's okay, I understand.

499
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:23,691
And you need to do what you have to do
to protect yourself.

500
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:28,696
Besides, no matter what they say
against you, I don't believe it

501
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:33,618
because I knew deep inside of my heart,
you're not the killer.

502
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,454
Thank you for your trust.

503
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:40,166
I thought you also believed I was guilty
of what they were accusing me of.

504
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,210
Never.

505
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,379
Of course I wouldn't be like that.

506
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,715
Growing up, I was always lonely.

507
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:51,177
Paco and Basil were there,

508
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:55,515
they raised me, they helped me,
they loved me, and protected me, but…

509
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,059
you're different.

510
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,061
You're different from them.

511
00:33:00,144 --> 00:33:01,521
You are my older brother.

512
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:06,567
You know, it's a good thing that
Detective Royales is good.

513
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,570
He can't be easily fooled

514
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,489
and he doesn't believe that
I am the killer.

515
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,534
And he will help us.

516
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:17,161
With what?

517
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:19,706
With finding the real killer.

518
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,669
Come on.

519
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,087
I'll show you something inside.

520
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:31,050
Here.

521
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,887
I bought you your study materials

522
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,181
because as early as now,

523
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:40,643
you should be studying
how to manage a business.

524
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:44,439
Someday, you will lead the company
and our family.

525
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,818
I will not disappoint you, Dad.

526
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,070
I'm gonna make you proud.

527
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,123
Louie?

528
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,212
It's Louie.

529
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,006
Louie is calling.

530
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,257
He probably--

531
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,011
From now on, you should avoid them.

532
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,888
Aren't they scared?

533
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,766
They're coming here
when there's a serial killer about?

534
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:22,643
Jerico…

535
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,314
Jerico, please.

536
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,984
Why do we need to get involved in that?

537
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:34,155
Can't it be just the two of us?

538
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:38,076
We'll just live quietly, you and me.

539
00:34:38,785 --> 00:34:40,578
Rebecca, we will not leave this place.

540
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:45,792
Jerico, everyone with Palacios blood
is getting killed off one by one.

541
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,795
That's exactly why
I don't want to leave this place.

542
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:54,175
Someone is killing our family,
and I won't allow that.

543
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,387
Rebecca, I've searched for my family
for a long time.

544
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,099
I won't accept losing you all.

545
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:04,769
Even if Ma'am Aurora is angry with me,

546
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:07,939
I won't let her be killed
by someone who hates our family.

547
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:11,067
But I don't want to lose you, Jerico.

548
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,401
I don't.

549
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,283
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

550
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:24,455
Besides, Sergeant Emil is on our side.

551
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,376
- Promise?
- Promise.

552
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:37,343
He was just trying to make sure
that I'm okay.

553
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:39,345
But what if they get targeted?

554
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:41,013
They are my responsibility.

555
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,849
What will I tell their parents?

556
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,436
We are actually trying to help
solve the crimes.

557
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,564
That's not your job.

558
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:52,650
That's the job of the police.

559
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:59,824
Your job is to study
and stay out of trouble, okay?

560
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,868
Galvan! Galvan!

561
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:04,871
Where did you go?

562
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,915
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on Sofia?

563
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:11,169
Yes, but wait.
I have something to tell you.

564
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:13,171
There's something you need to know.

565
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:14,672
Aurora is hiding something.

566
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,841
What?

567
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:21,929
Rico?

568
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,807
Rico, have you seen my bag?

569
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,058
Auntie!

570
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,322
So…

571
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,617
the bastard is back.

572
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,872
Here to enjoy your newfound
wealth, Jerico?

573
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,250
I have a right to be in this house.

574
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:56,130
He's a Palacios, just as much as we are.

575
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,134
We may share the same blood, Jerico,

576
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:04,513
but I will never ever
consider you as family.

577
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,686
What is Aurora hiding?

578
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,396
I am not sure.

579
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,814
I still don't know.

580
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,192
I came from her house.

581
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,362
I followed her to her office.

582
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:23,407
When I entered her office,
she had suddenly disappeared.

583
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,492
Wait!

584
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,038
You went to Aurora's house?!

585
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:33,626
But Galvan I heard voices.

586
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,212
I heard voices, but I don't know
where they were coming from.

587
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,548
Here!

588
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:42,677
I've still got goosebumps even now.
It was really scary.

589
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:43,678
Mom,

590
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,638
are you really sure you heard something?

591
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:46,806
It wasn't just your imagination?

592
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,976
Come on, Sofia! I'm not like Rebecca.

593
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,560
I'm not going crazy!

594
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:53,354
I'm sure about what I heard.

595
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:57,233
There were voices
coming from Aurora's office!

596
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:05,032
You are not supposed to go
to Aurora's house!

597
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,869
Aurora and I had an agreement.

598
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:13,374
The only reason she allowed you
to stay here at the estate

599
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,459
is because I promised her

600
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:19,422
you would not set foot in her house
without her permission.

601
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,425
What's with you, Galvan? Relax.

602
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,343
No one saw me! I promise!

603
00:38:24,427 --> 00:38:25,594
Regardless!

604
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,221
You should know your boundaries!

605
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,974
Really, Galvan?

606
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:31,267
Boundaries?

607
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:33,352
That's your priority right now?

608
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:36,897
You know, if I'd been concerned
about those boundaries,

609
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:40,151
then I wouldn't know what was happening
in the other mansion.

610
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:43,738
I wouldn't know what's happening
in Aurora's house.

611
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:45,323
How about you? Admit it.

612
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:49,618
Aren't you curious about
what's happening in Aurora's house?

613
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:51,996
What if it's your sister

614
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:56,167
who is hiding the serial killer who's been
killing people at the Palacios' Estate?

615
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,174
The police said he's innocent.

616
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,842
- The police?
- Yes.

617
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:08,804
Rebecca, they're useless. Inept!

618
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:13,684
The whole investigation
is just one big farce!

619
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,645
Letting this man out is dangerous.

620
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,981
He is a danger to you. To me.

621
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,900
To this family!

622
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,652
I am not a bad person.

623
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:27,531
You pretended to be a nobody

624
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,159
even though you knew that you were
a Palacios, Jerico.

625
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,744
You fooled us!

626
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,704
You lied to all of us!

627
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:38,334
And now you're telling me that
you're not a bad person?

628
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,588
I hid my identity because I knew
you wouldn't accept me.

629
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,131
Oh, that's good!

630
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,841
At least you knew!

631
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:50,346
I'm allergic to people who lie,
scheme, and manipulate.

632
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,057
Meaning…

633
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,392
you're allergic to yourself?

634
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,102
You're answering back?

635
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,520
No! Don't!

636
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,647
Don't you dare, Auntie!

637
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,069
Is that really possible, Dad?

638
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,448
That Auntie Aurora has a connection
with the serial killer?

639
00:40:11,117 --> 00:40:14,537
Don't listen to her, Sofia.
She's just hallucinating.

640
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,872
Galvan, I'm not hallucinating!

641
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,499
If you want, come with me!

642
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:22,545
I'll show you where I heard the voices.
Where they were coming from!

643
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,462
Enough!

644
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:24,755
Enough, Vivian!

645
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:29,176
No wonder your daughter feels like
she's an investigator.

646
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,886
She gets it from you.

647
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:32,805
Galvan, listen to me.

648
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:35,975
No! You listen to me!

649
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,437
You're not going
to Aurora's house anymore.

650
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,648
You will focus your time
on taking care of our daughter.

651
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:48,737
A serial killer is roaming around
killing people with Palacios blood.

652
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,656
Do you want to lose our daughter?

653
00:40:50,739 --> 00:40:52,783
Of course I don't want to!

654
00:40:52,867 --> 00:40:56,454
But what can I do against a serial killer?
I don't stand a chance.

655
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:59,457
Why don't you get your daughter
a bodyguard so she'll be safe?

656
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,542
Right? We have the money.

657
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:03,836
Why won't you get a bodyguard
so Sofia will be safe?

658
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,421
You're really annoying!

659
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:09,633
Just listen to me and do what I say.

660
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,052
Listen to me, Galvan!

661
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:15,014
Don't go to Aurora's house.

662
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:16,599
Take care of our daughter.

663
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:17,892
Do you understand?

664
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,645
- But…
- I said do you understand?

665
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,523
Okay, okay, I understand!

666
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:26,734
All right.

667
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:28,777
Okay, Sofia, my child.

668
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,780
From now on, I'll watch you carefully.

669
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,199
Eyes on you.

670
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,911
Because otherwise, people might say
I'm a worthless mother.

671
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:40,039
My God, this woman is annoying!

672
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:43,876
Why did I ever get myself
involved with you?

673
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:44,960
What?

674
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,546
If it wasn't for Sofia,

675
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:51,217
maybe I'd just let
the serial killer kill you.

676
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,427
How dare you?!

677
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:57,890
Did you hear what your father said?

678
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,142
That animal!

679
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,568
- But when you start hurting him…
- What will you do?

680
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:12,029
- What will you do, Rebecca?
- I don't know!

681
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:13,948
I'm sorry, but I don't know.

682
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:19,203
But I will not just stand here
and let you hurt my brother!

683
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:22,289
Look what you did
to my sweet girl, you bastard!

684
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:25,709
You turned her against me!

685
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,087
You taught her how to rebel, Jerico!

686
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:31,674
Maybe it's about time for me
to rebel, Auntie.

687
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:35,511
For the longest time,
I've been submissive in this house.

688
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:39,932
I don't want to be like that anymore.

689
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:42,685
I'm fed up.

690
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,688
Auntie, I'm tired of it!

691
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:51,694
From now on, I will do everything that
I think is right for myself!

692
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:55,155
And I will start that
by protecting my brother!

693
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,409
Let's go, Jerico.

694
00:42:58,492 --> 00:42:59,660
Let's go!

695
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,207
There it is.

696
00:43:52,421 --> 00:43:53,672
Aurora…

697
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,762
Why the hell are you rearranging
my shelves, Vivian?

698
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:08,020
I will throw you in the mud
where you belong!

699
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,480
NEXT EPISODE

700
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:12,691
Let me be clear to you, Vivian.

701
00:44:12,775 --> 00:44:18,530
You're a leech who is forcing yourself
on my brother!

702
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,532
Admit it.

703
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,284
Is Sofia the next target?

704
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:23,744
- Give me this.
- Sir Galvan!

705
00:44:23,827 --> 00:44:25,454
- Ma!
- What's happening?

706
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,790
Pa, why are you harassing my brother?

707
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,709
You know how to answer back?
You know how to fight?

708
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,170
I will fight for them,

709
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,632
especially if I know that
we're not doing anything bad.

710
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:40,386
Galvan Palacios, will you marry me?

711
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,303
No.

712
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,055
Stop your delusions.

713
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:46,850
I will never dare give the Palacios name.

714
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:52,356
<i>If you won't give me the Palacios name,</i>

715
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:56,193
I will bring you all down together.

716
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,153
Is it true that you had arguments
with the victims?

717
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:00,656
Yes, I had issues with them,

718
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,658
but that doesn't mean I killed them.

719
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,619
I will make sure that you rot in jail.

720
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:07,329
<i>Arrest her.</i>

721
00:45:07,413 --> 00:45:09,415
Mrs. Palacios, what's happening?

722
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:10,791
George…

723
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:12,209
Why are you bleeding?

724
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,588
I don't know.
