1
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,683
It seems like Sam believed
that it was the wife of our staff…

2
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:20,270
who Dr. Orly had a relationship with.

3
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:23,231
That woman, she's the killer.

4
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:24,816
She killed Beverly.

5
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:25,859
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:27,694
<i>Why didn't you tell us, Mother,</i>

7
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:31,156
that Dad had already left us?

8
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,616
Then, Dad died from an overdose?

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,702
Could it be that the woman is connected

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,287
to Dad's death?

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,913
He deserves that…

12
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,332
because he's a cheater. That's his karma.

13
00:00:41,416 --> 00:00:42,917
Good thing he died.

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,462
Francis…

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,298
It's enough for me
that you're a good friend.

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,676
But what if I want us
to be more than friends?

17
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,054
Do you know anything
that we shouldn't know?

18
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:57,098
Just ask Ma'am Aurora.

19
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,517
Why Mom Aurora?

20
00:00:59,601 --> 00:01:01,144
It's because…

21
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,397
she had a relationship with Dr. Orly.

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:10,820
Ma'am Aurora had an affair
with your father.

23
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:17,118
Ma'am Aurora is Dad's mistress?

24
00:01:21,498 --> 00:01:23,833
Sam, Dad's mistress
became your mother-in-law?

25
00:01:26,085 --> 00:01:28,171
The whole surrounding is secured, Madam.

26
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,340
There's a guard at every
gate of the mansion.

27
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:33,718
I hate this feeling, Amando,
that there are a lot of guards.

28
00:01:33,802 --> 00:01:35,970
This is also for you, madam.

29
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,639
The Palacioses are the target
of the killer.

30
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:41,017
I don't care about the killer, Amando.

31
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,562
My priority is Sam's safety.

32
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,941
Your hand.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,369
Everyone is safe in the compound,

34
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:00,745
but the manhunt for Beverly's killer

35
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:02,580
is still ongoing.

36
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,958
Okay, let's go.

37
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:11,589
Iñigo! Iñigo…

38
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:14,092
George, are you okay?

39
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,636
- How about the baby?
- We're okay.

40
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,012
It's the driver
of the motorcycle. I pity her.

41
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:31,901
That's the video of the woman
taken from the CCTV.

42
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,320
Sofia, are you sure

43
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:36,322
she's the one who stabbed Beverly Maison?

44
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:39,742
Last time you weren't able
to describe it to the police

45
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:41,327
because you said you couldn't remember.

46
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,121
Everything came back to me

47
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,081
when I saw her earlier.

48
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:47,167
I'm sure it was her that night.

49
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:49,002
Are you sure you don't know her?

50
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,545
We don't know that woman.

51
00:02:50,628 --> 00:02:52,171
That's why I'm sure

52
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:54,007
she's not staff of the estate.

53
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,552
How did you know?

54
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,388
Did he admit it to you?

55
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:03,516
There's nothing to say.

56
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,603
It was very obvious with their actions

57
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:07,812
and the way they looked at each other.

58
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,275
They often went
to the ancestral house before.

59
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,818
Just the two of them.

60
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:16,821
There was no one with them.

61
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,698
I'm calling her,

62
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,742
but she's not answering.

63
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,579
- She went out earlier with Francis.
- What?

64
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,247
Did they go out?

65
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,291
Things are dangerous now, Mercy.

66
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:31,461
Why did you let your children go out?

67
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,546
They want to find out…

68
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:35,757
who their father's mistress is.

69
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,805
It's the woman. Let's help her.

70
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,849
No, George. Wait.

71
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,477
But, Iñigo. Maybe she's injured.

72
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,188
George, look at her carefully.

73
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:52,190
Didn't you tell me

74
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,943
that the killer went to your house

75
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,862
and pretended to be a delivery girl?

76
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,156
Look at what she's wearing.

77
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,454
Sir, was she your employee in the mines?

78
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:10,375
We had hundreds of employees.

79
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,460
I don't recognize all their faces.

80
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,088
Send that to my secretary.

81
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:17,423
She'll take care of identifying

82
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,259
if she's from Palacios Mining.

83
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,218
Why?

84
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:23,930
Even the employees
of Palacios Mining are suspects?

85
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,556
Based on my research,

86
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,849
there are a lot of troubles and scandals

87
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,685
that happen in the mines…

88
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,104
because they don't like
the way it's being managed.

89
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:35,108
Sir, it's possible that one
of them is seeking revenge on you.

90
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,614
Did you see… any pictures or videos?

91
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,700
Ma'am, none…

92
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,621
because it was prohibited
to see them together.

93
00:04:52,959 --> 00:04:55,837
What else do you know, Ms. Belen?

94
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,964
When did this start?

95
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,257
How long was the affair?

96
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,468
Did they fight before my father died?

97
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:06,431
Ma'am, I can't answer that.

98
00:05:09,684 --> 00:05:11,477
What will Sam benefit from that?

99
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,480
They think Orly's mistress
is hiding a lot of things.

100
00:05:14,564 --> 00:05:16,232
That's just a waste of time.

101
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,900
Ask your children to come home.

102
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:19,777
She refuses to listen.

103
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,404
She will not stop

104
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,740
unless all her questions
have been answered.

105
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,534
What else does she have to find out?

106
00:05:27,827 --> 00:05:31,956
Your husband had a mistress,
took drugs, and died.

107
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,709
What's so hard to understand about that?

108
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,388
Yes, Mrs. George Palacios?

109
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:50,558
You saw the suspect?

110
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:54,479
<i>The description matched</i>

111
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:56,064
what Mom gave to me.

112
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:57,356
A woman, a bit small,

113
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,109
wearing a delivery girl uniform.

114
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,694
We're here in the basement parking

115
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,237
of the Pen building.

116
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:04,989
Okay.

117
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,076
Sergeant Royales will follow.

118
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,995
George, stay here and lock the door.

119
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,081
I will just follow the woman.
She hasn't gone far yet.

120
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,582
She's injured.

121
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,250
But, what if she's armed?

122
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:19,504
George, don't worry about me.
I can take care of myself.

123
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,552
Lock the door.

124
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,521
But, I remember now.

125
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,731
One night,

126
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,566
Ma'am Aurora asked me to prepare food

127
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,652
for her and Dr. Orly.

128
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:49,867
She even gave Dr. Orly
a gold watch that matched hers

129
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,244
and their names were engraved on them.

130
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:55,081
It's a remembrance
of their love for each other.

131
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,961
Maybe you're pushing them.

132
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:01,838
I'm not doing that.

133
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,965
Yeah, maybe, Mercy.

134
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,842
You don't mean it,

135
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,553
but you're always being dramatic

136
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:11,389
and playing the victim.

137
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:13,474
That's why your children are triggered

138
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,018
into doing something foolish.

139
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:26,654
- Sergeant Royales.
- George, why are you alone?

140
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,031
- Where is Attorney?
- He followed the killer.

141
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,450
Let's go to them. This way.

142
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,826
Let's go.

143
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,414
Iñigo?

144
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,375
Iñigo!

145
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:42,587
Iñigo…

146
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:45,089
Iñigo…

147
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,633
The killer is still here.
Surround the area. Hurry.

148
00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,719
Iñigo, stay with me.
Don't close your eyes.

149
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,636
Don't close your eyes.

150
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,263
Did the killer stab you?

151
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:56,058
Sarge, let your men go after the killer.

152
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,269
Let's prioritize Iñigo.
Let's take him to the hospital.

153
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,313
Iñigo…

154
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,865
Sir Galvan?

155
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:12,241
Sir Galvan…

156
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,244
Is it okay if I go out?

157
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:17,747
I need to go to George at the hospital.

158
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,917
Why? What happened to her?

159
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,543
Why is she in the hospital?

160
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,963
How about the baby? How's the baby?

161
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,549
Sir Galvan, George is okay.

162
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,092
It's Iñigo who is in the hospital.

163
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,385
He was stabbed.

164
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,973
Dad, I pity Attorney Iñigo,

165
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,558
he also got involved with our mess.

166
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:40,686
Sofia. What do you mean he's pitiful?

167
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,357
I already told George
to stay away from that man.

168
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,026
Look. He even got involved
with the problem.

169
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:51,030
Sir, Iñigo just wanted to help
to capture Beverly's killer.

170
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:52,448
I don't care.

171
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,826
Tell your daughter
to stay away from that man.

172
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,253
Sam, I'm really confused.

173
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:08,005
The man said
that Dad's mistress was his wife.

174
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,049
But, Ms. Belen is telling something else.

175
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:11,050
It's like they're playing games with us.

176
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,219
They are really playing games
with us, Francis.

177
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,638
They are confusing us
so we won't find out the truth.

178
00:09:16,722 --> 00:09:18,599
Who do you believe more?

179
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:20,851
They're both just stories
without evidence.

180
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,274
Thank God. Your back, Sam.

181
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:37,034
Everyone is troubled here,

182
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,328
and yet you and your brother
are roaming around?

183
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,748
What if…

184
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:44,834
the killer found you?

185
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,253
What if she killed you and my grandchild?

186
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:49,880
Is that the reason why there's a lockdown?

187
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,465
The killer was able to follow us?

188
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,925
Yes, Francis.

189
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,261
She almost got into the compound.

190
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:57,513
She wants to kill Ma'am Aurora.

191
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:58,639
Good thing she was stopped.

192
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:02,977
But, she's still out there,
stabbing people.

193
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:07,064
From now on, everyone will stay here.

194
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:15,114
The doctor said you're still lucky

195
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,908
because no vital organs were hit.

196
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,036
But, you still have to stay here
for a few more days

197
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:21,746
until you get better.

198
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,345
Attorney Morales, is it a good time?

199
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,848
Sarge, they just finished
stitching up his wound.

200
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,434
I only have a few questions for him

201
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,936
about his confrontation
with the alleged killer.

202
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:48,022
Ma'am Vivian…

203
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,109
Uncle Galvan is not close with Iñigo?

204
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,363
No.

205
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,323
You know…

206
00:10:57,865 --> 00:11:01,327
that's one of
the biggest mysteries for me.

207
00:11:01,911 --> 00:11:05,873
Why Galvan is so pissed off

208
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,458
with that lawyer

209
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,669
when he happens
to be the best friend of his son, right?

210
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,005
Did they mention something to you?

211
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,007
No.

212
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:19,553
But, you know I have a strong hunch…

213
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,598
that they have something before.

214
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,685
It's scary to go out.

215
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,729
What's scarier?

216
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:31,065
The killer stabbing you upfront,

217
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:33,067
or the person you treated as family

218
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,277
stabbing you?

219
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:37,696
What are you talking about, Sam?

220
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,491
I bumped into Ms. Belen earlier.

221
00:11:40,574 --> 00:11:41,867
And?

222
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:46,497
And she confessed
who my father's mistress is.

223
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,916
Who?

224
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:58,008
Is there something you want
to admit to us, Mom Aurora?

225
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,849
Can we just do that tomorrow?

226
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:07,768
George, it's okay.

227
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:13,190
Attorney, is this the one who stabbed you?

228
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,118
She's the one.

229
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:28,414
Is she familiar to you?

230
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,624
No.

231
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,793
But, why did you go after her?

232
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,964
What do you mean by something?

233
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,721
You know…

234
00:12:43,804 --> 00:12:45,931
It's something… That…

235
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,600
They were lovers before.

236
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,311
Like this is Iñigo…

237
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,396
and Basil…

238
00:12:58,319 --> 00:13:04,825
But, George said her husband is not gay.

239
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,076
But, you know…

240
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,080
I don't know.

241
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:16,212
I don't know why Galvan
is so pissed off with Iñigo

242
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:18,214
when supposedly,

243
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,425
he is the best friend of his son.

244
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,219
Right?

245
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,222
So, we know already.

246
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,809
- Right?
- Yes.

247
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,647
Oh my, let's deny more.

248
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,776
Me?

249
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,486
What do I have to confess?

250
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:42,530
Come on.

251
00:13:42,613 --> 00:13:45,282
I'm giving you the chance to come clean.

252
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,701
There's nothing for me to confess to you.

253
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:49,286
Sam…

254
00:13:50,162 --> 00:13:51,497
What did she say?

255
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,915
Go directly to the point.

256
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:55,292
Mom Aurora is Dad's lover.

257
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,920
What?

258
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:01,924
Ma'am Aurora, is that true?

259
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,469
You had a relationship with Orly?

260
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,102
You don't know the person,
but you went after her?

261
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:16,105
I had a hunch that she was the killer.

262
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,191
And it matched George's description.

263
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,111
That's why I went after her.

264
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,487
And then what happened?

265
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:26,699
I went after her,

266
00:14:27,283 --> 00:14:30,578
and then I got stabbed.

267
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:47,261
You didn't even talk?

268
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,140
You didn't ask who she was,

269
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:55,227
and what the Palacioses did to her?

270
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,604
And why she is killing them?

271
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:02,943
I'm not going to dignify
that question with a response.

272
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,862
Yes or no is the only answer
to that question.

273
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:06,113
Answer us directly.

274
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,198
I've answered that before.

275
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,368
You keep asking that question
again and again,

276
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,912
when you don't have a basis.

277
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:14,371
It's Ms. Belen.

278
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,832
That old lady is just making trouble.

279
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,709
What for? What will she benefit from it?

280
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,170
She's seeking revenge
because she was fired.

281
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,380
Because she was old, weak,

282
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,799
and failed to do her job.

283
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,886
Is that really the reason you fired her?

284
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:31,597
Or, maybe because you didn't
want your secret to be exposed.

285
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,933
There's no secret, Sam.

286
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,434
There's no conspiracy.

287
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:40,189
Your father and I did not have an affair.

288
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,985
Why are you forcing

289
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:48,447
that Orly and I had an affair?

290
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:49,490
Because what?

291
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,951
If you find out who his mistress was,

292
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:53,869
you will know why he died?

293
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,913
A week after he left us.

294
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,414
That's when he died mysteriously.

295
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,626
Your father's death was not mysterious.

296
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:04,630
He died of an overdose.

297
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:08,175
He was autopsied
and there was an investigation.

298
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,178
All the results were the same.

299
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:13,597
As a lawyer…

300
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,351
you weren't even curious
about her motives?

301
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,562
Things happened so fast.

302
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,773
I went after her,

303
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,859
she took out the knife,

304
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,947
and then she stabbed me.

305
00:16:30,531 --> 00:16:33,617
So, you're telling me, Attorney,

306
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:37,788
a five foot eleven man

307
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,583
was outsmarted by a small woman?

308
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,135
I can call
your father's investigator again,

309
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:52,052
if you want.

310
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,346
No. My father did not commit suicide.

311
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,140
He was not an addict.

312
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:01,353
Sam…

313
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,982
For the longest time,

314
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:10,320
I was in denial
that Paco was already dead.

315
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:12,364
And look what happened.

316
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:14,491
Look what happened to me.

317
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,326
I almost went crazy.

318
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,247
But, I fought it.

319
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,124
I slowly accepted

320
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,752
that my son was no longer with me.

321
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:28,422
Sam, I hope you'll do the same.

322
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:32,301
For the sake of your family.

323
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,931
Sarge, why are your questions like that?

324
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,185
Iñigo already helped out
and got in trouble.

325
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,687
Why does it seem like
you're insulting him?

326
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,190
Ms. Georgina, I'm not insulting anyone.

327
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:49,193
I want to see the big picture.

328
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,071
She's a trained killer.

329
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:57,701
It's obvious that she knows
what you're doing.

330
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:02,331
She knows how to get away from you.

331
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,542
That's why you couldn't catch her.

332
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,172
Right, Sergeant Royales?

333
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,056
Sofia saw Beverly being stabbed
by the window.

334
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,192
And then she was dragged to the room

335
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,401
and that's where she was killed.

336
00:18:32,945 --> 00:18:35,405
According to Sofia's statement,

337
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:37,241
when they went inside the room,

338
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:39,201
they only saw Beverly's dead body.

339
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,536
The suspect was gone.

340
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,149
Here. Here in this cabinet.

341
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,485
We only found out
that there's a secret tunnel here.

342
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,788
Cairo, here.

343
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:25,789
Cairo.

344
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:27,249
Cairo, here.

345
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,346
Here.

346
00:19:43,223 --> 00:19:44,975
The killer is not from the estate.

347
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,686
How did she find out
that there's a tunnel there?

348
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,230
That means, someone told her.

349
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,566
She has an accomplice.

350
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,776
The question is, who?

351
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,962
You're still alive.

352
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,173
Don't worry…

353
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:19,176
next time I will kill you.

354
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,485
You're an animal, Juliet.

355
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:39,238
You'll pay for what you did to me.

356
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,198
That's what you deserve.

357
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,908
Traitor.

358
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,201
Juliet…

359
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,828
Juliet…

360
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,498
Juliet…

361
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,547
Let's stop this, Sam.

362
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,927
Will your father come back to life?

363
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:03,762
No.

364
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,307
Can we change the past?

365
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,726
We can't.

366
00:21:09,810 --> 00:21:11,937
But, Mother, don't you want closure?

367
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:13,522
Closure?

368
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,526
I'm forcing myself to forget
what happened to your father.

369
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,153
But, ever since you brought it up,

370
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,323
all the pain has come back.

371
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:26,493
I'm now confused about…

372
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,746
who your father's mistress is.

373
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,293
You know, you're so stupid.

374
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,379
Why did you show yourself
to the Palacioses

375
00:21:37,462 --> 00:21:38,714
without telling me?

376
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,966
I'm just carrying out our plan.

377
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,218
<i>I already killed Beverly</i>

378
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,928
<i>and the child of Basil Palacios.</i>

379
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:50,350
No, please.

380
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,061
Please no… No.

381
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:05,157
What will you get
if you find out about the past?

382
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:08,744
You cannot undo the past anymore.

383
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:20,172
One night,

384
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,506
Ma'am Aurora asked me to prepare food

385
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,633
for her and Dr. Orly.

386
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:27,220
She even gave Dr. Orly a gold watch

387
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,849
that matched hers.

388
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,225
And their names were engraved on it.

389
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:36,021
It's a remembrance
of their love for each other.

390
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,235
I was planning to kill Aurora next.

391
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,487
What?

392
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,530
Did you do it?

393
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,408
You failed, right?
What will happen to you now?

394
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,827
They already saw your face.

395
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,289
It's only a matter of time
before they can identify you.

396
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,041
You ruined the plan.

397
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,252
Was it really me who ruined it or you?

398
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,631
<i>You suddenly lied low</i>
<i>when you killed Peter.</i>

399
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:04,925
<i>You…</i>

400
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,304
<i>I did it.</i>

401
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,182
I finally did it, <i>Mi Amore.</i>

402
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:55,392
Did what?

403
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,272
I left my family.

404
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,234
Why?

405
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,069
Isn't this what you wanted?

406
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:07,320
For us to be together.

407
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:09,156
You said you don't want
to be called a mistress.

408
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:11,783
This is it. I'm giving you your wish.

409
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:17,747
Abandoning your family

410
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:20,709
does not make you a single man, Orly.

411
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,858
I'm warning you.

412
00:24:49,487 --> 00:24:51,198
- Ouch.
- Be quiet.

413
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:52,782
Someone might hear you.

414
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,161
Why? Are you ashamed?

415
00:24:56,244 --> 00:24:58,538
Well, you should be ashamed

416
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,957
because you failed.

417
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:02,667
Because Peter is a fake Palacios,

418
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:04,461
but you can still make up for it.

419
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,339
There are still a lot of Palacioses.

420
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,133
I heard…

421
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:13,303
that Basil's wife, George,

422
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,263
is pregnant.

423
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:18,725
Not her.

424
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,103
Hello, Doc.

425
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:25,732
How is Rebecca?

426
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:29,945
That's good.

427
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:34,616
Please take care of her.

428
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:36,868
If there's a problem,

429
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,870
just call me.

430
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:42,165
I will take care of everything she needs.

431
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,216
Okay, Doc.

432
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:52,842
Yes.

433
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:56,846
Thank you.

434
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,246
I knew it.

435
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:23,873
Are you falling for that woman?

436
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:26,376
I pity her.

437
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,628
She's also a victim of Basil.

438
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,381
But, she's still the wife of a Palacios

439
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,174
and they will have a baby.

440
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,301
What?

441
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:36,011
Did that woman brainwash you already?

442
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,305
Maybe I should kill her first.

443
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,724
Where is she? Is she there?

444
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:47,522
Didn't I tell you, not her?

445
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,662
George is your weakness.

446
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,664
<i>Because of a woman,</i>

447
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:07,584
you turned your back on our mission.

448
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:10,670
That George Palacios
should be ready for me.

449
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,964
She's my next target.

450
00:27:13,048 --> 00:27:14,424
No.

451
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,488
I'm warning you.

452
00:28:20,698 --> 00:28:23,993
Don't you ever hurt George.

453
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,455
Scary.

454
00:28:28,581 --> 00:28:30,375
I'm not playing games with you.

455
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,254
I know your family.

456
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,799
I know where you live.

457
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:41,010
I can easily have you arrested.

458
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,556
Sam…

459
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,350
What are you doing?

460
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:54,065
Why do you have the same
watch as my father?

461
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:57,485
And why are your names engraved on it?

462
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,949
Do you think if the police arrest me,

463
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,409
I'll be the only one imprisoned?

464
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,036
<i>I will involve you.</i>

465
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:10,039
I will tell the police the truth,

466
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:12,000
that we're in connivance.

467
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,460
<i>I will deny it.</i>

468
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:16,379
You don't have proof.

469
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:19,591
No one will believe you.

470
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,385
<i>You even stabbed me, right?</i>

471
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:24,846
Are you daring me?

472
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,725
Answer me.

473
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,895
Why do you have matching
watches with my father?

474
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,938
It's just a…

475
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:38,276
It's just a gift
for his service in the mines.

476
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:40,779
Do you give all your employees watches?

477
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,989
So, what if we have that?

478
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,658
It doesn't prove anything.

479
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:46,743
Of course, it does.

480
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:49,954
It means what Ms. Belen said is true.

481
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:53,958
You have watches, as a sign
of your love for each other.

482
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,919
What? Will you still deny it?

483
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:59,130
I have nothing to deny or admit.

484
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,550
Don't make me stupid.

485
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,260
What else do you want, Sam?

486
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,012
I want the truth.

487
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,640
Tell me the truth.
Are you my father's mistress?

488
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,810
Tell me the truth.
Are you my father's mistress?

489
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,728
Are you my father's mistress?

490
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,854
Yes!

491
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:18,274
Yes, Samantha.

492
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:22,195
Orly and I had an affair.

493
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,280
Are you happy now?

494
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,791
All this time I've been looking

495
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,167
for my father's mistress.

496
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:37,836
And it turns out she's just
in front of me.

497
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,004
The snake who destroyed my family

498
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:42,590
is just in front of me.

499
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:44,133
We had an affair.

500
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,679
It was short. It was brief.

501
00:30:47,762 --> 00:30:49,639
It ended when he died.

502
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,599
What?

503
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,185
Should I call the police?

504
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:56,771
<i>Should I admit everything to them?</i>

505
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,731
How you came to me

506
00:30:59,274 --> 00:31:01,818
and convinced me
to seek revenge on the Palacioses?

507
00:31:05,405 --> 00:31:07,615
I didn't force you, Juliet.

508
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:12,370
Everything you did was voluntary.

509
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,498
That's it?

510
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:17,667
Aren't you even remorseful?

511
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,212
You said you wanted the truth.

512
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,131
What more do you want? Details?

513
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,382
Yes.

514
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:27,135
I want to know all
your immoralities with my father.

515
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,344
When did it start?

516
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:30,388
Sam, he's dead.

517
00:31:30,471 --> 00:31:31,723
It's over.

518
00:31:32,473 --> 00:31:33,892
That will not change anymore.

519
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:35,935
I already admitted the truth to you.

520
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:39,063
- Let it rest.
- No. Come back here.

521
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:40,481
- Come back here.
- Sam.

522
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,442
- You're so shameless.
- Ouch. Let me go.

523
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,277
You're so shameless.

524
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:47,947
Do you remember
how we studied the Palacios family?

525
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:49,699
How you were able to enter the family

526
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:51,743
because you made Basil
fall in love with you?

527
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:55,663
<i>What will George's reaction be</i>
<i>if she finds out…</i>

528
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,165
<i>that you and Basil were lovers?</i>

529
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,959
I'm sure she'll be disgusted with you,

530
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:01,628
with both of you.

531
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,589
Go ahead, Juliet.

532
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,260
Tell everything you know.

533
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,140
And then what will happen to you?

534
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,102
The Palacioses will put you in jail,

535
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:23,650
and then you'll rot there…

536
00:32:24,734 --> 00:32:26,152
just like your mother.

537
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,203
- Sam, let me go.
- Do you want me to be quiet?

538
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,663
- Sam.
- You're so shameless.

539
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,997
- Sam.
- Let her go.

540
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:39,958
- Sam…
- Sam…

541
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:42,251
Mother, I was right.

542
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,713
This woman is Dad's mistress.

543
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,465
She ruined our family.

544
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,592
She destroyed your marriage.

545
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:53,012
I didn't ruin any relationship.

546
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:58,476
Orly didn't love your mother
to begin with.

547
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,854
Liar. Our family was happy until you came.

548
00:33:01,938 --> 00:33:04,232
Orly and I knew each other

549
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,318
before you and Francis were born.

550
00:33:07,402 --> 00:33:09,112
Before he met Mercy,

551
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,322
I was already part of your father's life.

552
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,158
He was mine first.

553
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,043
We have ID'd the woman
who stabbed Attorney Morales.

554
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,130
She also stabbed Beverly Maison.

555
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:30,508
She is Juliet Gambao,

556
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,385
Thirty-seven years old,

557
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,762
from San Jacinto.

558
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:37,640
She's a former police officer
who was fired from the service.

559
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:42,311
She's trained, just like Iñigo thought.

560
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,312
George.

561
00:33:48,151 --> 00:33:50,028
What else do you know about her?

562
00:33:50,528 --> 00:33:53,948
Why is that Juliet targeting my family?

563
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,241
Is she a former employee of the mines?

564
00:33:55,324 --> 00:33:56,617
No, not her.

565
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:58,536
It's her mother.

566
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,289
Manuela Gamboa.

567
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:06,002
An old employee who joined
the 1996 strike.

568
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,806
That's the strike
where a lot of employees died.

569
00:34:20,183 --> 00:34:22,226
Apparently, Manuela was part of the group

570
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:26,606
who bombed the miners
who refuse to join the movement.

571
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:29,484
She was caught, imprisoned,

572
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:31,027
and died in jail.

573
00:34:32,612 --> 00:34:34,155
That's why Juliet is seeking revenge

574
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,782
because of what happened to her mother?

575
00:34:36,616 --> 00:34:39,786
We were in college when Orly
and I first had a relationship.

576
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,288
But, my father didn't like him.

577
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,750
My father wanted me to marry someone else.

578
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,336
I had no choice.

579
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:49,837
I broke up with him.

580
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,965
I married Paco's father.

581
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:56,385
And that's when he met your mother.

582
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:01,265
That's not true.

583
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,101
That's not true,
you're just inventing this.

584
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,685
Years after…

585
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,481
Orly applied to work in the mines.

586
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,068
He knew I owned Palacios Mining,

587
00:35:12,151 --> 00:35:15,071
but he still chose to work there

588
00:35:15,154 --> 00:35:17,156
because he wanted to be near me.

589
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,283
He wanted to be with me…

590
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:20,952
because he loved me.

591
00:35:21,035 --> 00:35:23,037
No! Stop your delusion.

592
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,956
You seduced my father.

593
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,582
Go ahead.

594
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,709
Ask your mom.

595
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,463
Mother…

596
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,924
Ma'am Aurora is lying, right?

597
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,593
Dad loved you first. Right, Mother?

598
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,974
Answer them. Don't make it look

599
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,725
like I'm a liar.

600
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,311
Tell them that when you met Orly,

601
00:35:47,395 --> 00:35:49,939
wasn't he mending a broken heart?

602
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,235
There was…

603
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:57,155
Your father mentioned…

604
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,117
a woman before.

605
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,119
That was me.

606
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,413
I am that woman.

607
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,836
Even so.

608
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,796
Even though you came first,

609
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,923
you still had an affair
with a married man.

610
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:18,843
Because your father couldn't forget me.

611
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:22,597
It seems the suspect
is seeking revenge. That's her motive.

612
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,725
We're still looking
if she has an accomplice.

613
00:36:26,976 --> 00:36:27,935
Who?

614
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:29,937
We're still finding out.

615
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,898
But, it's a big possibility

616
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:34,525
that her accomplice
is from Palacios Estate

617
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,319
because she knows about the secret tunnel

618
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,863
going to the room
where Beverly Maison was staying.

619
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,742
I stayed away from him several times,

620
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:44,160
but he kept coming to me.

621
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:48,372
He told me
that I was the only woman he loved.

622
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,875
He only married Mercy
because he got her pregnant.

623
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,501
Take back what you said.

624
00:36:52,585 --> 00:36:54,378
Didn't you want to know the truth?

625
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,755
Here it is.

626
00:36:55,838 --> 00:37:00,635
The pure, unfiltered, unadulterated truth.

627
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:05,223
Orly was willing to wait for me,

628
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,351
but you got pregnant.

629
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,272
He was trapped in a loveless marriage.

630
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,275
Sergeant Royales…

631
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,153
Look for that Juliet.

632
00:37:19,862 --> 00:37:22,823
Arrest her. And all of her accomplices.

633
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:24,325
For all we know,

634
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:26,702
she has something to do
with Basil being poisoned.

635
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,080
We're also looking at that angle.

636
00:37:29,163 --> 00:37:32,124
She needs to pay
for what she did to my family.

637
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,168
Even to Iñigo.

638
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:36,087
George.

639
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:39,840
Why do you keep on saying
the name of that man?

640
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,592
What, Dad?

641
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:46,180
Juliet stabbed Iñigo.
He deserves justice too.

642
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,438
- Mercy.
- How dare you?

643
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,023
Don't you ever make Sam

644
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,359
feel like it's her fault
that I gave birth to her.

645
00:37:58,442 --> 00:38:01,654
That's why you weren't able
to continue your relationship with Orly.

646
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:04,323
Is it my fault that I became his wife

647
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:05,992
and not you?

648
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:07,785
- That's enough.
- If only I could…

649
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:09,328
- Mother…
- If only I could…

650
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:10,705
That's enough.

651
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,622
Mother, stop it.

652
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:13,165
Mother…

653
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,765
We're not done yet.

654
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,214
<i>Why are you spying</i>
<i>on your father's mistress?</i>

655
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,799
<i>Galvan, Sam already knows the truth.</i>

656
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:05,968
The truth about you and Orly?

657
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:06,927
<i>Sam is investigating.</i>

658
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:09,055
<i>What if she finds out</i>
<i>what really happened to Orly?</i>

659
00:39:09,138 --> 00:39:11,557
<i>No one else visits you here?</i>

660
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,351
- How about your siblings?
- I'm an only child.

661
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:14,852
- How about your parents?
- They've been gone for a long time.

662
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,562
My mother had a heart attack

663
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:17,688
when Dad was arrested.

664
00:39:17,772 --> 00:39:19,440
He was just framed by his enemies.

665
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,317
If you notice
something different, update me.

666
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,610
<i>Especially Attorney Morales.</i>

667
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:24,737
It's possible that the one you're calling
an ally is Juliet's accomplice.

668
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,406
Everything I do is for my parents.

669
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,325
Are you going to attempt
to kill Auntie Aurora?

670
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,242
George, please stop picking on me.

671
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:32,828
Because if not, I will cut your tongue.

672
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,663
Come near me and I will rake you to death.

673
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:36,332
Don't come near me.

674
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:38,626
Guard. Guard.
