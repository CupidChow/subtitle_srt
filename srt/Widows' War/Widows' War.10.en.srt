1
00:00:14,264 --> 00:00:15,390
Ma'am Rebecca!

2
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:18,143
Here you are. We've been looking for you.
You need to drink your medicine.

3
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:21,896
If I drink it, my vision gets messed up.

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:22,939
What vision?

5
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:28,361
I'm scared in my dream.
Someone always dies.

6
00:00:28,445 --> 00:00:31,406
They're covered with blood.
I don't know who they are.

7
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,451
I heard that your wife
and Sam's mother had a fight.

8
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,785
You better talk to your wife.

9
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,454
Don't worry about it.

10
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,080
George will stop…

11
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,081
for good.

12
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:43,084
<i>I still can't believe that</i>
<i>George hurt you.</i>

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,419
<i>What happened, Mother?</i>

14
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,503
<i>Why did George hurt you?</i>

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,796
I saw her.

16
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>She was talking to the investigator.</i>

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,966
<i>She even gave him money.</i>

18
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:52,010
<i>Maybe she wants to turn</i>
<i>the tables on your sister.</i>

19
00:00:52,093 --> 00:00:54,304
Maybe she's planning something
bad against you, Sam.

20
00:00:54,387 --> 00:00:55,972
Why did you contact Abdul?

21
00:00:56,056 --> 00:00:59,768
<i>I was thinking of asking him to help me</i>
<i>find out who sent the death threat.</i>

22
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:01,603
Mother, what if Basil
has a mistress?

23
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,063
There's only one solution I can see

24
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,814
to make sure your husband
will not leave you.

25
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,066
Give him a child.

26
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:08,193
Do I have good news for my husband?

27
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,320
Is now the best time for us
to have a baby?

28
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:12,405
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Palacios,

29
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:15,283
but it will take a miracle
for you to bear a child.

30
00:01:15,366 --> 00:01:18,119
What are your and George's plans
for your birthday?

31
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:20,163
I have grander plans for my birthday.

32
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,958
So this is where we plan to build
the stage for your birthday.

33
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:26,836
We just need to move the swing
so we can have space.

34
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,214
You can't take that away!
Auntie Aurora won't agree.

35
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,673
I will tell her.

36
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:31,549
Ow.

37
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,801
You will do no such thing.

38
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,469
Sir, you're hurting your cousin.

39
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,304
<i>- Go ahead and show your courage.</i>
<i>- Sir, I don't want trouble.</i>

40
00:01:36,888 --> 00:01:39,474
- Hey! Basil!
- You fool!

41
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:42,727
- Try to avoid this.
- Basil, that's enough!

42
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:45,230
Why are you fighting with our helpers?

43
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:48,358
It's unbecoming of a future COO.

44
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:52,237
Says the person who never
had a chance to be one!

45
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:53,530
You bastard!

46
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:56,533
Like father, like son!

47
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,492
Hello, Ma?

48
00:01:57,575 --> 00:01:59,494
Sam, where are you?

49
00:01:59,577 --> 00:02:02,413
Why didn't you even tell Francis
that you were going out?

50
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,125
<i>There's something I need to finish.</i>

51
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,127
PREVIOUSLY

52
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,183
Right, that's what they told me.

53
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:06,269
Maybe that's why they're like that.

54
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,354
That's what they told me.

55
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,235
Hello?

56
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:57,737
Sam, may I borrow Paco's jacket again?

57
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,447
I want to wear it
to Basil's birthday party.

58
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,200
<i>That's scheduled for the weekend.</i>

59
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,451
Well, it's better to be prepared

60
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,830
because Basil might notice me
and pick on me.

61
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,123
Basil?

62
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:11,960
Why?

63
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,169
My goodness, Sam.

64
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,963
There was trouble here earlier.

65
00:04:15,046 --> 00:04:19,342
He fought with the estate helpers before
and people are really scared of him.

66
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,594
Basil is terrible.

67
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,762
He's a monster.

68
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,723
<i>Everything he wants must be done.</i>

69
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,106
Sam, you can only leave once you're done
with what I'm asking you to do.

70
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:36,359
What do you think you're doing?

71
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:38,945
Sam, you're so basic.

72
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,114
Do you think that's the only video
of your murderous act?

73
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,324
<i>I have hidden the videos</i>
<i>in different places.</i>

74
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,410
If you expose me, I will expose you too.

75
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:18,901
Jerico…

76
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,364
I hope…

77
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,868
I hope you won't leave

78
00:05:26,951 --> 00:05:28,828
because of what Basil did.

79
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,580
What goes around, comes around.

80
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:34,834
I won't be a helper here
for the rest of my life.

81
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:36,335
That's good.

82
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,964
It's okay that you have a dream in life.

83
00:05:41,549 --> 00:05:43,384
Actually, you're the same.

84
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,472
You're the same as the person I loved.

85
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:55,813
All right.

86
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:57,023
I'm not allowed upstairs.

87
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,816
Ma'am Aurora might get mad at me.

88
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,110
Wait…

89
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:04,947
Don't worry.

90
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:08,493
I will tell Auntie

91
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:12,413
what Basil did.

92
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:10,388
Auntie…

93
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,143
Auntie…

94
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,645
Auntie, why are you crying?

95
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,315
I dreamt of Paco.

96
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,152
He was asking for help.

97
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,904
He wants justice, Rebecca.

98
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:29,949
Justice for what?

99
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:32,410
I don't know.

100
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:37,081
All I know is that he needs my help.

101
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:45,089
Auntie…

102
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,634
Auntie, stop crying.

103
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,806
Auntie, what if…

104
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,228
What if we talk to Paco's soul?

105
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:09,590
I haven't had any success
in making contact with the spirits.

106
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:12,426
Well, using the Ouija board.

107
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,012
But…

108
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,684
perhaps in my cards,

109
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,186
Paco,

110
00:09:23,145 --> 00:09:24,355
he…

111
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:28,401
can send a message to us.

112
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,404
Just do it, Rebecca.

113
00:09:32,029 --> 00:09:33,823
I just want to know…

114
00:09:33,906 --> 00:09:37,034
what my son is trying
to tell me.

115
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,537
Please.

116
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,717
Queen of Cup.

117
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,596
<i>The Goddess of the Family.</i>

118
00:11:21,472 --> 00:11:26,685
<i>She puts interest of others</i>
<i>before herself,</i>

119
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:31,482
<i>and she is always overwhelmed in life.</i>

120
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,329
The High Priestess.

121
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:52,753
<i>She represents the divine feminine energy.</i>

122
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:55,631
<i>She signifies love,</i>

123
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,717
<i>fertility,</i>

124
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:03,722
<i>and spiritual awakening.</i>

125
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:20,364
Death card.

126
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,247
Death card?

127
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,918
What does that mean?

128
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,672
Is this Paco?

129
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,716
No.

130
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,886
It's another death.

131
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,265
Someone else will die.

132
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,598
Who?

133
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,267
Who will die?

134
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,530
I don't know yet, Auntie.

135
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:35,285
My cards haven't
told me anything.

136
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,642
Mrs. Palacios?

137
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,394
Help! Help!

138
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,437
Mrs. Palacios…

139
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,564
Call the police!

140
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,566
Help!

141
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:06,859
Help us!

142
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,652
Mrs. Palacios…

143
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,656
Help us!

144
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,875
Mrs. Palacios…

145
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,709
And how do I look?

146
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,044
You look good, sir.

147
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:36,049
It looks perfect on you.

148
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:44,683
This is my most important
birthday to date.

149
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:47,644
It's a great start

150
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,897
of a great many things for my life,

151
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,441
so I have to look my best.

152
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,444
You're right, sir.

153
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,155
How about this one, sir?

154
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,908
Oh…

155
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:05,120
That, I'm saving
for a different occasion.

156
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,063
Hello?

157
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:35,025
Oh my God, what happened?

158
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:38,820
Are you okay?

159
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:44,201
I'm so glad nothing
bad happened to you.

160
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:15,190
Excuse me.

161
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,150
I'll just go out.

162
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,865
Ma'am, the police officer is here.

163
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,417
You're the one who almost got run over?

164
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:37,129
I was so scared.
I thought I was going to die.

165
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:38,922
Don't worry.

166
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:40,799
I'm here for you.

167
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,844
So, you two know each other?

168
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,349
We were…

169
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,101
Friends.

170
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,687
Abdul and I are old friends.

171
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,106
I mean Sergeant Major Casas.

172
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:58,608
But we haven't talked for a long time.

173
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:06,450
Did you see the driver?

174
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,787
Or the plate number?

175
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,958
How about the vehicle type?

176
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,293
Do you remember?

177
00:22:18,378 --> 00:22:20,130
It was a sedan.

178
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:24,259
I'm not sure about the color
because it was dark in the parking lot.

179
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,181
Is someone mad at you?

180
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,143
Do you have problems at home?

181
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:37,647
Do you have marital problems?

182
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:46,073
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

183
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,832
George, you need to tell me

184
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,335
so I can help you.

185
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,756
I don't know.

186
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,133
Maybe the driver was drunk.

187
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,843
They suddenly swerved away.

188
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,889
If they had really wanted to kill me,
they shouldn't have avoided me.

189
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:16,686
Well, that's one possibility.

190
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:21,691
But I still need to investigate
this case.

191
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,742
I'll take you home.

192
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:37,290
It's okay.

193
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,297
I will still look for
the person who did this.

194
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,550
I promise.

195
00:23:58,353 --> 00:23:59,479
George,

196
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,023
could it be that what happened earlier

197
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,818
has something to do with the death threat
that you received?

198
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,319
You really can't remember
anything, George?

199
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:07,737
Not even just a little clue?

200
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:08,989
Yes.

201
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,325
Nothing. That's it.

202
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,379
How about while you were in the hospital?

203
00:24:24,462 --> 00:24:27,591
You don't remember anything
unusual happening?

204
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:08,131
Sam, wait!

205
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,604
Where were you?

206
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:25,232
Why?

207
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,861
I almost got run over earlier.

208
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,821
I have a feeling it wasn't an accident.

209
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,074
I have a feeling
it was done intentionally.

210
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,204
Are you okay?

211
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:43,416
Did you see who it was?

212
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:49,130
Where were you around 7:00 p.m.?

213
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,688
Wait, wait…

214
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:09,317
Are you accusing me of being
the one who tried to hit you?

215
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,987
George?

216
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:19,369
I saw someone wearing the same hoodie
just like that in the hospital.

217
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,705
That's it?

218
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:24,374
That's your proof?

219
00:26:24,791 --> 00:26:29,462
George, do you know how many people
have this kind of hoodie?

220
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,716
Just answer my daughter's question.

221
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:34,509
Where were you?

222
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:39,514
The mall. I went shopping.

223
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,516
If you want, go to the mall

224
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:44,060
and talk to all the sales ladies there.

225
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:46,771
Ask them if you don't believe me.

226
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,525
Just make sure that
you're telling the truth, Sam.

227
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,570
Because if you're not,
I will do more than run you over.

228
00:26:55,405 --> 00:26:57,657
Is that a threat?

229
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,414
Let's go, Mother, Ward.

230
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:08,543
Let's just wait for the results
of the investigation.

231
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:12,630
The driver who almost ran me over
will have to face their karma.

232
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,491
Let me check the CCTV.

233
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:43,912
CCTV hasn't been installed, sir.
This parking lot is new.

234
00:27:45,622 --> 00:27:49,793
There's no CCTV.
There's no other witnesses.

235
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,962
So tell me,

236
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,216
how can we find the car
that almost hit the victim?

237
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,218
Partner…

238
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,846
Partner, why are you so eager
to find the driver?

239
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:07,268
According to Mrs. Palacios,
wasn't what happened an accident?

240
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,104
An accident again.

241
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,568
Just like what happened to Paco Palacios.

242
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,950
Love…

243
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:24,452
I'm so glad you're okay.

244
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,289
How are you feeling?

245
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,917
I'm okay now. I feel better
because I'm with you.

246
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,796
George should have a bodyguard next time.

247
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:35,880
That's right.

248
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,133
My daughter is no longer safe, Basil.

249
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:41,761
I thought you said it was an accident.

250
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:44,764
Why would we need a bodyguard?

251
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:48,351
I mean, isn't that
a bit of an overreaction?

252
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,773
Yes. It was an accident.

253
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:57,444
That's why we thought it would be better
if I had someone with me

254
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,363
so that an incident like that
doesn't happen again.

255
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:03,992
Yes.

256
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,493
Yes, of course.

257
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:07,370
Thank you, love.

258
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,165
I know you'll protect me.

259
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,125
You can't afford to lose me

260
00:29:12,208 --> 00:29:14,377
and you won't replace me
with anyone else, right?

261
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,010
Of course, love.

262
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:27,432
Let me go and handle the…

263
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,185
bodyguard situation now, okay?

264
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,603
I'll leave you first.

265
00:30:34,415 --> 00:30:36,042
Mother…

266
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,711
you startled me.

267
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,714
Why do you look so scared, Sam?

268
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,344
You just startled me.

269
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,430
How did your appointment go?

270
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,350
Did you finish what you were going to do?

271
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,602
I didn't push through with it.

272
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,242
If you're having a hard time,

273
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:11,953
pray.

274
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,080
Hold on to God.

275
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:18,585
He knows what's happening to us.

276
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,506
He will help you.

277
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:29,554
He has the answer to everything.

278
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,268
Because of your stupidity,

279
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,688
George is requesting
a bodyguard.

280
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:03,523
How will you kill her now?

281
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,191
I will find a way.

282
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:07,026
My birthday is coming up.

283
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:09,487
Your time is running out.

284
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,215
Sam!

285
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,509
Sam! Sam…

286
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,142
What happened?

287
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:41,728
Here's the money.

288
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,104
Thank you.

289
00:33:46,149 --> 00:33:47,025
Hey.

290
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,152
- I think this is too much.
- No, no, it's okay.

291
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,030
I added some more for your
shopping allowance and our daughter's.

292
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:56,200
I want both of you to look presentable
at Basil's birthday party.

293
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,037
Of course.

294
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,455
Your invitation.

295
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,916
You heard that.
We have to look presentable.

296
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,293
We will go.

297
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:10,214
The last time we went there,
Basil looked down on us.

298
00:34:10,298 --> 00:34:13,760
Sophia, last time
was a different situation.

299
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:17,472
- This time, it's your brother's birthday.
- Yeah.

300
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,016
Probably, he wouldn't mind you
being there.

301
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,310
Probably?

302
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:26,230
You're not sure.

303
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,691
No thanks, Dad.

304
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,110
I would rather stay at home

305
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:34,363
than attend
one of your stupid little parties.

306
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:35,615
Sofia!

307
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:40,453
Sofia, don't you dare
talk to your dad that way!

308
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,788
Don't be rude!

309
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:42,830
Vivian…

310
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,415
- No!
- It's okay.

311
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,583
It's not!

312
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,169
I don't need you to defend me, Dad!

313
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:49,962
Sofia!

314
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,598
That brat.

315
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,353
Hon, I'm so sorry.

316
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,480
Please be patient with your daughter.

317
00:35:07,563 --> 00:35:08,773
I will talk to her.

318
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:10,608
Why is she mad at me?

319
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:17,365
That's because even after all this time,
you still haven't married me.

320
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:21,953
So in Sofia's mind,
she's still an illegitimate child.

321
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:25,581
Honey…

322
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:28,876
When will you marry me?

323
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,171
Aurora will not allow it.

324
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:35,591
And I still have plans.

325
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,760
Me and Basil.

326
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,179
Once that's fixed,

327
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:44,100
that's when we'll get married.

328
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:56,362
How many guests do we have too?

329
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,530
There.

330
00:35:57,613 --> 00:35:58,739
And then the stage?

331
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,492
- All right.
- My God.

332
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,869
It's hot, let's go.

333
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,415
- All right.
- What's going on here?

334
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,960
What's going on here?
Where are you taking that?

335
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:12,253
Hey!

336
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,088
What's happening here, Basil?

337
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,631
Tell me!

338
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,634
Did you not get your invitation?

339
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,553
You have it?

340
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:22,930
Here.

341
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,975
Aurora Palacios.

342
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,996
All of you leave!

343
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,165
All of you, get out of here!

344
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,128
No party will happen in my house!

345
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,422
Go ahead, it's okay.

346
00:36:58,424 --> 00:37:00,259
Auntie Aurora, in this estate,

347
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:04,472
you have your house and we have ours.

348
00:37:05,765 --> 00:37:07,016
But this…

349
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,143
this…

350
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,437
this whole place,

351
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,397
this belongs to the family.

352
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:15,650
Basil,

353
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,903
we just finished Paco's memorial.

354
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:23,532
You're already celebrating?!

355
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,119
I knew it!

356
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:31,165
You're trying to erase my son's memory.

357
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:32,917
Auntie…

358
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:36,504
I'm only trying to replace it
with a happier one.

359
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,589
And what's next?

360
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,424
Tell me.

361
00:37:40,508 --> 00:37:43,135
Do you also plan
to erase him from the company?

362
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:45,263
That will never happen, Basil.

363
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:46,472
Oh, Auntie.

364
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,808
It will happen.

365
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:52,478
Who else would his replacement be?

366
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,357
Basil…

367
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:02,697
I have better options in mind
rather than you!

368
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,665
Aurora, let's go.

369
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,295
Let's go.

370
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,796
All of you!

371
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,673
All of you! Listen to me!

372
00:38:20,756 --> 00:38:23,342
This party is canceled!

373
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,470
Do you hear me?

374
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:29,140
No party will happen here!

375
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:31,517
All of you, get out of here!

376
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,826
Okay, get back to work.

377
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,161
Get back to work. Help me again.

378
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:52,371
Boys, help me, please.

379
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:55,166
Show's over. Can I see that?

380
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,669
It's your fault, Sam.
You never get enough sleep.

381
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:00,671
And the doctor said you needed to rest.

382
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,798
It's a good thing I saw you last night.

383
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:07,178
Those insensitive monsters!

384
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:13,476
How could they just go on with their lives
while here I am, grieving and miserable?

385
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:22,151
I know that jacket.

386
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:24,278
I bought that for Paco.

387
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,072
Give me that!

388
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:27,281
Ma'am, I just borrowed it.

389
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,532
- Take that off!
- Hold on.

390
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,785
Wait a second.
No one was using it.

391
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,914
I was right.

392
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,750
Paco isn't important to you.

393
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,336
You didn't love my son!

394
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:45,883
If you'd loved him and valued him,
you wouldn't just give away his things!

395
00:39:55,017 --> 00:39:56,227
That's not true.

396
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,980
I haven't forgotten Paco.

397
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,316
Oh, yeah?

398
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,742
When did you last visit Paco's shrine?

399
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,913
And when was the last time
you lit a candle for him?

400
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,166
Ma'am Aurora,

401
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:24,171
just because you don't see her sad
doesn't mean she's not grieving.

402
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,714
If you only know,

403
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,717
she always dreams of Paco.

404
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,052
Right, Sam?

405
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:35,266
Killer!

406
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:37,977
No! No, no!

407
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,396
Please no!

408
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,233
You're all the same!

409
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,154
You have forgotten my son!

410
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,683
That's everyone Basil invited
to his birthday party.

411
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:21,270
Check who Basil's mistress could be.

412
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:23,355
Classmate, co-worker, all of them.

413
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:26,400
She'd be beyond shameless
if she actually came to the party!

414
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,613
Whoever she is,
she wants me gone and replaced.

415
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,032
That's why it's driving me crazy.

416
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:35,826
But I'm so sorry for her
because I'm not going anywhere.

417
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:19,912
<i>Mom?</i>

418
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:24,959
Paco?

419
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:26,710
Paco…

420
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:32,675
Paco, my son, I can hear you.
Where are you?

421
00:42:32,758 --> 00:42:34,510
Show yourself to me.

422
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,095
Where are you, son?

423
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,055
Where are you?

424
00:42:40,266 --> 00:42:41,308
<i>Mama?</i>

425
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,231
Paco?

426
00:42:47,856 --> 00:42:48,899
Paco!

427
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:51,610
Paco…

428
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:23,976
Paco…

429
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,062
My son, Paco, my son…

430
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,609
Paco, my son…

431
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,985
Paco…

432
00:43:55,716 --> 00:43:57,301
Don't!

433
00:43:57,718 --> 00:44:00,804
Aurora… Ma'am Aurora.

434
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:04,308
Don't come near me. Just stay there!

435
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,684
Just let me be!

436
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,935
Auntie!

437
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,313
What was that?

438
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:14,735
Sam, be careful.

439
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:19,198
Mother.

440
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,532
What was that?

441
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:22,826
I'll go with Paco.

442
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,787
- Aurora, don't.
- I'll go with him.

443
00:44:28,082 --> 00:44:29,333
Please, don't!

444
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:34,171
- Please. Don't, Aurora.
- I don't want anymore, Amando.

445
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:35,673
- My son…
- Don't.

446
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:37,466
It's Auntie Aurora!

447
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,928
Yes, to her room! Now!

448
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:42,388
Please.

449
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,306
Hello?

450
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:46,558
What?

451
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:48,602
Calm her down. I'm on my way there.

452
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,020
What's happening?

453
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:51,897
There's trouble in the other house.

454
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,697
I will go with Paco.

455
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,616
Paco, Paco, Paco…

456
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:04,493
Aurora, don't.

457
00:45:06,995 --> 00:45:07,996
Please.

458
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:09,957
Ma?

459
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,212
- Ma?
- Don't come near me.

460
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,588
Don't come near me.

461
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:19,174
Don't come near me!

462
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,718
Just stay there!
Don't come near me!

463
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:23,470
Auntie, please, put down the gun.

464
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:24,888
Please, don't do it, please.

465
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,307
No, this is not the solution.

466
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,809
Not this.

467
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:32,396
- I don't want to go on anymore.
- Please.

468
00:45:32,479 --> 00:45:33,272
I'm so tired.

469
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:35,899
I'm very tired.

470
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:39,403
- I want to be with Paco!
- Don't! Don't!

471
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:41,905
I'm so tired!

472
00:45:41,989 --> 00:45:42,948
Hey, Aurora!

473
00:45:43,031 --> 00:45:45,742
I want to be with Paco.

474
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,327
That's enough!

475
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,913
- Aurora, that's enough.
- Galvan, don't come near me.

476
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:51,373
Don't come near me.

477
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,750
Give me the gun. Let's talk.

478
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,877
I don't want to.

479
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,253
I don't want to!

480
00:45:56,336 --> 00:45:59,882
Stop it! Just give me the gun
and let's talk!

481
00:45:59,965 --> 00:46:04,887
I only want to talk to one person!
I only want to talk to Paco!

482
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,263
Just Paco!

483
00:46:10,017 --> 00:46:11,935
- Ma…
- Mother.

484
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,896
If Paco were here,

485
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:17,191
he would hate to see you like this.

486
00:46:18,525 --> 00:46:20,444
He always used to tell me

487
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,280
that his mother was a fighter.

488
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:26,033
She never gave up.

489
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:29,828
Don't give up on your life, please.

490
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,749
Please.

491
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,836
You're right.

492
00:46:41,423 --> 00:46:43,258
Why would I kill myself?

493
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:53,268
- Don't! Don't!
- No!

494
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:57,814
- Don't do it, please!
- It should be you who dies!

495
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:11,245
It's my distinct honor to introduce to you
the man of the hour…

496
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:12,538
NEXT EPISODE

497
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,916
- I'm George.
- George Palacios, Basil's wife.

498
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,334
Basil never mentioned me?

499
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,836
You know our history,
that we fooled around before?

500
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,090
Why on earth would Basil
invite his own mistress

501
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,384
to his birthday party
when I'm there?

502
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:28,178
What, was he planning to announce that
they're going to have a baby?

503
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,721
…the birthday boy himself…

504
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,265
<i>Basil married me.</i>

505
00:47:31,348 --> 00:47:35,435
I am his wife. That's why
I should carry his child.

506
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:36,478
Then why didn't you?

507
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,773
…my son, Basil Palacios.

508
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,783
- What's happening? Basil?
<i>- I had a dream.</i>

509
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:53,245
There's going to be two new members
of the Palacios family.

510
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,121
Just two?

511
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,833
No extra Palacios family members?
Even those… who are just half?

512
00:47:57,916 --> 00:47:59,751
<i>Mr. Palacios.</i>
