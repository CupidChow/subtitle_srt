1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,765
<i>I will not let Basil control me.</i>

2
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:19,227
<i>I will not kill the person</i>
<i>I once treated like a sister.</i>

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,103
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,272
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

5
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:23,440
You need to get up.

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,150
Today is Sir Paco's memorial.

7
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:30,530
How do you even say goodbye
to your only son?

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,906
Son.

9
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:33,116
Sorry, son.

10
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:34,534
<i>Sam, you're so basic.</i>

11
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,995
Do you think that's the only video
of your murderous act?

12
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:38,913
I have hidden the videos
in different places.

13
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,750
Either you follow my orders
or I will expose the video.

14
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,918
I am not a murderer.

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,129
Maybe you think I'm playing with you.

16
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,298
<i>We should all be like Paco.</i>

17
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:50,717
We shouldn't let others dictate
our choices even if we are threatened.

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,761
<i>We should not be swayed</i>
<i>by what others want.</i>

19
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,971
Let's see where your courage takes you.

20
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,598
I'd like to show you guys something.

21
00:00:56,681 --> 00:01:00,018
Ladies and gentlemen,
the truth about Paco Palacios.

22
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:01,686
Oops! Wrong video.

23
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,104
I miss you, my cousin.

24
00:01:03,188 --> 00:01:05,315
Especially since I'll be celebrating
my birthday soon.

25
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:06,983
We will party in your name.

26
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:10,528
Party? Paco just died, Basil,
and you want a party?

27
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:12,030
It's my birthday.

28
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:15,825
And it will be your last
if you push through with your party.

29
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,744
Delete the video.

30
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,871
Not here.

31
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:29,130
Why aren't you joining
the festivities outside?

32
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,758
I just went out briefly
to touch up my makeup, Pa.

33
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:34,260
It's so hot, it feels like
it's still summer.

34
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,304
Summer…

35
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:39,974
Did you know that Summer
was the name of Basil's dog?

36
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:45,021
I didn't know that Basil liked pets.

37
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,857
He loved Summer so much.

38
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:53,822
He always let her sleep in his room

39
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,699
until one day, the dog bit him.

40
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,663
The next day, the dog was dead.

41
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,498
It ate a bar of chocolate.

42
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,166
The brand…

43
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,418
Basil's favorite.

44
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,767
I pity the dog.

45
00:02:22,851 --> 00:02:25,270
I'll never forget that incident

46
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:28,273
because until now, I still see that dog

47
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:32,277
as one of Aurora's taxidermy.

48
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:38,825
Look, I have no intention

49
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,952
of exposing your little crime…

50
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:44,122
unless you will not do what I want.

51
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:47,375
So, please, do this one favor for me.

52
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,461
Why me? Why don't you get a hitman?

53
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:54,382
Those people are only loyal to money…

54
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:56,509
unlike you.

55
00:02:56,593 --> 00:03:00,221
If you expose me, I will expose you too.

56
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:06,311
Basil, I can't kill George.

57
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:08,021
Why?

58
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,022
I mean,

59
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,107
it's not like you guys are best friends.

60
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,651
Hell, you hate each other.

61
00:03:14,235 --> 00:03:16,905
What about you? What's your reason?

62
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,365
The less you know, the better.

63
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,492
Tell me the truth.

64
00:03:21,576 --> 00:03:22,327
Did you fight?

65
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,662
Do you have an issue, is that it?

66
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:25,496
Something like that.

67
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,748
Then break up with her.

68
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,874
Get an annulment.

69
00:03:27,957 --> 00:03:29,042
Look.

70
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,669
You're in no position
to give me any advice.

71
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,965
I'm giving you until my birthday
to kill George.

72
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,593
Consider it your birthday gift to me.

73
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:42,096
Or else, I will give you a gift.

74
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:47,018
The gift of justice
for what you did to my cousin.

75
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:18,424
Basil is like that.

76
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:20,343
He loves giving.

77
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,888
He will give everything
to the person he loves.

78
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,099
But cross him,

79
00:04:26,182 --> 00:04:29,185
you'll regret it until the day you die.

80
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:12,061
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

81
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:29,203
Basil wants you gone?

82
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,455
Wait, wait.

83
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,540
What does this mean?

84
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,917
He wants you dead?

85
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,878
Or replaced.

86
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,047
Who is this from?

87
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,715
I don't know.

88
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,884
There's no name written there.

89
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,264
Wait, what did Basil say?

90
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,016
We haven't talked yet.

91
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,392
George, you need to talk to him.

92
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,771
Ask him what does this letter mean?

93
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:58,900
Mother, what if…

94
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:00,485
What if…

95
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:04,572
George, don't tell me
you believe this letter?

96
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:08,493
What would Basil's reason be
for wanting you gone?

97
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,175
Hello, babe?

98
00:06:26,385 --> 00:06:28,179
Don't be impatient, babe.

99
00:06:28,262 --> 00:06:31,307
Everything is falling into place, okay?

100
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:35,269
George will be gone by the time I hit 36.

101
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,024
What do you mean you feel guilty?

102
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,485
No way.

103
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,570
George is a liar!

104
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:48,199
She made me believe we could have a child.

105
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:56,457
My doctor told me that the tissue scarring
most likely developed when I had surgery.

106
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,046
Mother, what if
I can't get pregnant anymore?

107
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:10,721
She made me believe that the Palacios
lineage would continue through her.

108
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:13,391
That she would give me an heir.

109
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:16,602
I gave up my bachelor life
and turned my back on you for George!

110
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:17,895
And for what?

111
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,480
For her to fool me?

112
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,731
To make me look like, what?

113
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,775
To make me look like a fool? No way!

114
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,193
George must die!

115
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,912
Wait…

116
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:39,459
Do you think Basil has a mistress?

117
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,588
Last night, I saw him talking
to someone on his cell phone.

118
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,674
He even left the room so they could talk.

119
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:50,595
But they could have been talking
about business, right?

120
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:52,430
Mother, if Basil doesn't have a mistress,

121
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,516
then what else could that note
possibly mean?

122
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,978
And who sent you this?

123
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,063
George…

124
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,547
Do you miss him?

125
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,676
Paco?

126
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,639
I mean…

127
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,143
my cousin, Paco.

128
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:24,230
You miss him, right?

129
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,986
I get the feeling.

130
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,035
I lost a loved one too.

131
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,875
I was supposed to marry him…

132
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,546
five years ago.

133
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,007
How I wished…

134
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,552
How I wished we'd gotten married first

135
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:57,638
before he died.

136
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,934
At least, I could call myself a widow.

137
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,979
I'm sorry.

138
00:10:05,896 --> 00:10:07,773
Can I get your hand?

139
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,779
My therapist taught me

140
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:19,827
that whenever I feel triggered,
I should do this.

141
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:23,914
Sam…

142
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,961
You know what? Your…

143
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,339
your palm looks strange.

144
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,092
Yeah.

145
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,094
'Cause I think…

146
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:41,807
I think you're keeping a secret.

147
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:49,440
A dark, dark secret.

148
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,823
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

149
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:33,025
Love…

150
00:11:35,319 --> 00:11:37,238
I have a gift for you.

151
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,743
What's this?

152
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:53,045
Why do you suddenly have a gift for me?

153
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,131
Are you trying to compensate
for something?

154
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,298
Like a mistake?

155
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,467
No, love.

156
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,928
To be honest,

157
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,806
I'm still affected
by what happened to Paco.

158
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,851
It made me realize how short life is,

159
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,980
and that we should make the people we love

160
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:13,357
feel special every day.

161
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,943
Because you never know

162
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,904
when they will suddenly be gone.

163
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,285
Let me.

164
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,203
Let's try this on.

165
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:28,539
Okay.

166
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,803
See? Beautiful.

167
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:45,848
What's that?

168
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,358
Can I see it again?

169
00:12:57,067 --> 00:12:58,861
Sam, I need to know what it is.

170
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:02,448
Sam, let me see your hand.

171
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:07,077
Let me see it.

172
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:10,456
I said let me see it.

173
00:13:15,878 --> 00:13:16,921
This?

174
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:19,507
It's just my credit card bill.

175
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,424
Oh.

176
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,759
Well, give it to me.

177
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:24,178
I'll ask my secretary to pay it.
How much is it?

178
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:25,721
No need. I'll do it.

179
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,389
I'll take care of it.

180
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,821
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

181
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,919
Ma'am, let's go, ma'am!

182
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,339
Sam, please.
I need to see your hand!

183
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:01,632
- I need to see it!
- Get her.

184
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:03,467
- No! I saw something on her hand!
- Get her.

185
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,886
- She's hiding something from all of us!
- Yes, yes…

186
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,971
- Ma'am Rebecca…
- Sam!

187
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,639
Hold her.

188
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:10,391
- Sam!
- Sorry.

189
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,523
Did you get hurt?

190
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,989
Ma'am Rebecca is just like that.

191
00:14:25,072 --> 00:14:29,702
If she fails to take her medicine,
she invents a lot of stories.

192
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:19,460
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

193
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,170
The police officer wanted to talk to me?

194
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,007
Why me? It should be Basil.

195
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,509
Ma'am, do you want me to call Sir Basil?

196
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,845
No need. I'll take care of this.

197
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:54,513
Okay, ma'am.

198
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:07,484
Yes, Sergeant Major Casas?
How may I help you?

199
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:11,113
I missed your call last night,

200
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:15,576
and you didn't reply
when I sent you a message.

201
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,203
Is there anything wrong?

202
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,498
I must've accidentally
pressed your number.

203
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,628
These past three years, George,

204
00:17:26,712 --> 00:17:29,381
you've never
accidentally pressed my number.

205
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:34,094
And you expect me to believe
that it was an accident?

206
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,724
George, come on.

207
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,394
Is everything okay?

208
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,189
Yes, everything's okay.

209
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,275
Does this have something
to do with the death of…?

210
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:49,401
Nothing.

211
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,571
Look, I'm so sorry for bothering you,

212
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:55,491
but I will just pay you

213
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,659
for all the trouble that I've caused.

214
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,829
George, please.

215
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:12,049
Go ahead, accept it.

216
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:16,011
Who is that?

217
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:20,099
She took a picture of us.

218
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,476
People might misunderstand the situation.

219
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,561
I have to go.

220
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,598
Auntie Mercy!

221
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,562
Auntie Mercy.

222
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,117
Auntie Mercy.

223
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:23,579
What you saw earlier?
That was nothing.

224
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,747
The investigator was just
reporting something to me.

225
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,668
If you're not doing anything bad,
you don't have to explain anything.

226
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,338
- Give me your cell phone.
- Why?

227
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,674
I want to delete
the picture that you took.

228
00:19:35,757 --> 00:19:39,595
I don't want others to misinterpret
the picture of us together.

229
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,681
Stop bothering me.

230
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:44,433
Auntie Mercy!

231
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:51,523
Auntie Mercy,
I said give me your cell phone.

232
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,526
Auntie Mercy!

233
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:58,197
I told you to give me your cell phone.

234
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,865
Give it to me!

235
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:03,243
- I said give it to me!
- Stop bothering me!

236
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,953
- I will erase the picture.
- No!

237
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:06,872
I said give me your cell phone!

238
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,123
- What's with you?
- Oh!

239
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,791
- Hey!
- Ms. Mercy!

240
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,293
Auntie Mercy!

241
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:18,592
Ma'am Mercy…

242
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,052
Ms. Mercy…

243
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:22,846
- Can you still move?
- Mother?

244
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,017
- It seems like--
- Mother, what happened to you?

245
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,186
Ouch…

246
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,104
What happened?

247
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,315
Let me help you.

248
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:36,902
Mother, what happened to you?
Did you get hurt?

249
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:40,405
- What happened?
- Ma'am, it's because…

250
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,992
- George?
- Sam?

251
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:46,578
What did you do to my mother?

252
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:48,121
Come down here!

253
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,706
- Come down!
- Sam.

254
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,541
Sam, let me explain.
It was just an accident.

255
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,252
You don't want to come down, huh?

256
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,963
If you're mad at me, hurt me,
not my mother!

257
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,464
Fight me, not my mother!

258
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,174
Not my family!

259
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:02,177
Talk to me, George. Come here.

260
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:03,220
What's your problem?

261
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:06,056
It's your mother's fault.
She likes to meddle.

262
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,225
Instead of apologizing,
you're getting angry at her?

263
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:11,395
Why would I apologize
when I didn't mean for that to happen?

264
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,105
Your mother is so stupid!

265
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:16,650
How dare you?!

266
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:21,196
- You're so shameless!
- You're shameless!

267
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,447
It's your mother's fault!

268
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,700
- Ma'am, that's enough!
- Let go of me!

269
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:26,368
It's all your mother's fault!

270
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:27,869
You should talk to your mother!

271
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,914
Enough, Sam!
Stop it, Sam!

272
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,625
Let go of me!
It's all your mother's fault!

273
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,752
- It was an accident
- Is this what you want?

274
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,726
I'm okay.

275
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,529
George has really changed.

276
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,698
She even involved Mother.

277
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:08,410
Don't worry.

278
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,786
They'll face their own karma.

279
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:12,289
Sam, Mother got hurt

280
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,207
and we're just going to let
karma punish them?

281
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:18,003
What, do you think I'll let this go?

282
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:20,589
When you got hurt in the past,
did I just let that go?

283
00:22:24,801 --> 00:22:26,136
Francis!

284
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,805
Let go of my brother!

285
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:29,973
Francis!

286
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,475
Let go of my brother!

287
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:33,351
Let go of him!

288
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,103
Francis! Francis!

289
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,314
Your brother disrespected my sister!

290
00:22:37,397 --> 00:22:38,398
Hold on!

291
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,317
They both wanted what happened!

292
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,818
Francis just broke up with her,

293
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,779
that's why she invented a lot of stories!

294
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,198
- Wait a second!
- Don't meddle here!

295
00:22:58,168 --> 00:22:59,669
That's enough, Sam!

296
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,712
Sam!

297
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,422
Sam!

298
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:03,924
Sam, that's enough.

299
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,009
Sam, that's enough! Sam!

300
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,178
Sam, that's enough!

301
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,314
Sam, Sir Castro almost died.

302
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:21,274
They can hurt me,

303
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,860
but not you

304
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:26,530
or Mother.

305
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,955
Sam, I'll just check on Mother.

306
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,998
It looks like it's about to rain.

307
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,726
I'm surprised you called.

308
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:24,940
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of this call?

309
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:26,858
You were right.

310
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:32,030
Your wife is an evil, manipulative bitch.

311
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,868
And we can no longer co-exist
in the same world.

312
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:38,703
Exactly.

313
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:40,830
That's what I've been trying to tell you.

314
00:25:40,914 --> 00:25:42,624
One of us has to go,

315
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:47,003
and it's not gonna be me.

316
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,594
George has to go.

317
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:55,971
There she is.

318
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,889
That's my girl.

319
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:17,367
Ma'am!

320
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,327
Ma'am Rebecca?

321
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,496
Cairo!

322
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:23,957
Cairo! Cairo!

323
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,334
Ma'am!

324
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,502
Cairo, help me.

325
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:28,920
It's Ma'am Rebecca.
She needs to drink medicine.

326
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:30,714
I can't find her!

327
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,011
Ma'am Rebecca!

328
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,930
Ma'am Rebecca!

329
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,996
Rebecca…

330
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,833
Here you are. We've been
looking for you for some time now.

331
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:14,174
Nurse Angie said
you need to drink your medicine.

332
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,051
I don't want to.

333
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,720
Rebecca, it's for your own good.

334
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,680
I said I don't want to!

335
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:27,812
If I drink it, my sixth sense
gets suppressed.

336
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,398
My vision gets messed up.

337
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,652
What vision?

338
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,782
For the past days…

339
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,994
I have been…

340
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:46,414
I have been dreaming the same thing.

341
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,087
And every time I wake up,

342
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,508
I draw everything I remember.

343
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,764
I'm scared.

344
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,646
I'm scared in my dream.

345
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:13,233
Someone always dies.

346
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,444
They're covered with blood.

347
00:28:18,905 --> 00:28:20,990
I don't know who they are.

348
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,010
Death.

349
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,027
Basil?

350
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,449
I heard that your wife
and Sam's mother had a fight.

351
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:04,701
You better talk to your wife.

352
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:07,996
Our plan will be ruined
if Sam's family leaves

353
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,623
because your wife
won't stop bothering them.

354
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:15,128
Don't worry about it.

355
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:20,508
Soon enough, George will stop for good.

356
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:23,553
All right.

357
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:25,054
I'll take your word for it.

358
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:30,477
By the way, what are your
and George's plans for your birthday?

359
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,730
Do you want me to make a reservation
at your favorite restaurant?

360
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,983
Dad, you're so basic.

361
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:40,236
I have grander plans for my birthday.

362
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,571
Grander plans?

363
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,407
Don't you think it's a bit too soon
to throw a party?

364
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,451
Your cousin just died.

365
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,161
Exactly.

366
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:49,788
Paco is now dead.

367
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,582
All the more reason
to celebrate my birthday.

368
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,918
I don't want Aurora to think

369
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,588
that we're being insensitive
to what she's going through.

370
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:01,341
And what about me, huh?

371
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:04,260
It's my birthday, but I should prioritize
the feelings of others?

372
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,845
Of Auntie Aurora?

373
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,222
To hell with her!

374
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,309
I'm celebrating my birthday
come hell or high water.

375
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:31,454
Mother, here.

376
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:34,916
Francis, give me your morphine.

377
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,835
My body is still aching.

378
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:39,838
The medicine the doctor gave me earlier
didn't take effect.

379
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,048
Mother, don't take the morphine.

380
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,591
It's bad for you.

381
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:47,929
In just one more hour,
you can drink your medicine.

382
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:49,514
Just endure it till then.

383
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,267
Yes, Mother.
Besides, morphine is dangerous.

384
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:55,562
You can die from an overdose with that.

385
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:02,610
I still can't believe that
George hurt you.

386
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:07,407
What happened, Mother?

387
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,325
Why did George hurt you?

388
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,828
I saw her. She was talking
to the investigator.

389
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,496
She even gave him money.

390
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,584
Who is that? She took a picture of us.

391
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,963
I think she's bribing that Sergeant Casas.

392
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,841
Why would she do that, Mother?

393
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,801
The investigation is over.

394
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,178
Paco died due to an accident.

395
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:30,972
That's what I'm wondering about.

396
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:33,683
Maybe she wants to turn
the tables on your sister.

397
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:37,020
Maybe she's planning something
bad against you, Sam.

398
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:41,065
I'll get ahead of her.

399
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,682
George, why did you push Mercy
down the stairs?

400
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,268
Mother, it's all her fault!

401
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:20,229
If she'd deleted the picture,
then there wouldn't have been any trouble.

402
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,815
But why did you contact your ex?

403
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:26,319
George, you're already eating steak.
Don't go back to eating Bopis.

404
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,613
Mother, it's not like that.

405
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:30,531
Then why did you contact Abdul?

406
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:35,536
I was thinking of asking him to help me
find out who sent the death threat.

407
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,539
You're getting too paranoid
about that letter.

408
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,084
Mother, what if Basil has someone else

409
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,127
and his mistress is trying to scare me?

410
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:45,296
Don't tell me you think
I shouldn't do anything?

411
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,925
They're all like that. Galvan has Vivian.
Your father was like that too.

412
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,093
Mother,

413
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,720
Auntie Mercy seduced Father.

414
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,433
As long as Basil comes home
to you, it's okay.

415
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:01,354
Other women might be okay
with that situation. I'm not.

416
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:04,440
I love Basil and I won't share him
with someone else!

417
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,944
Well, then there's only
one solution I can see

418
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,946
to make sure your husband
will not leave you.

419
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,531
What is it?

420
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,157
Give him a child.

421
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,744
Mother, you know my situation, right?

422
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:20,081
Yes, but the doctor said that
maybe you can find a way.

423
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:22,041
Or maybe a miracle will happen.

424
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,585
When's your next appointment
with your doctor?

425
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,120
Hello, Ma?

426
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,081
Sam, where are you?

427
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,375
Why didn't you even tell Francis
that you were going out?

428
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:49,504
There's something I need to finish.

429
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,220
Mrs. Palacios, you came early.

430
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,639
Hold on, the doctor still has a patient.

431
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,099
Okay, no problem.

432
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,767
Where can I buy water?

433
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,269
- This way, ma'am.
- Okay.

434
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,479
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

435
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,470
So this is where we plan

436
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,931
to build the stage for your birthday.

437
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,434
We just need to move the swing
so we can have space.

438
00:37:08,517 --> 00:37:10,603
Okay, go ahead.

439
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:12,897
Can you help, please?

440
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:14,523
Help, please.

441
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,069
Take it away.

442
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,111
- Is there anything else?
- Oh my.

443
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,197
- Come on, guys.
- Wait!

444
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,033
- Is there anything else?
- Guys, wait! No, no, no, no!

445
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,284
Hey, stop!

446
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:27,203
You can't take that away!

447
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:30,957
Basil, that was Paco's favorite spot.

448
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,376
You can't move this.

449
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:36,254
Rebecca, it's only for the party.

450
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:37,880
We'll put it back after.

451
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:40,132
No. Auntie Aurora won't agree.

452
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,133
I will tell her--

453
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,176
Ow.

454
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,136
You will do no such thing.

455
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,514
Basil, that hurts.

456
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,099
You'll get hurt more
if you continue to meddle.

457
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:51,727
Sir, you're hurting your cousin.

458
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,145
Are you okay?

459
00:37:58,109 --> 00:37:59,652
And who the hell do you think you are?

460
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:15,960
So, Doc, do I have good news
for my husband?

461
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:18,087
Is now the best time for us
to have a baby?

462
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:25,636
The medication I gave you
didn't work, Mrs. Palacios.

463
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,432
But I didn't miss any dose.

464
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:32,226
I followed all your advice.

465
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:37,064
I told you beforehand that there was
no guarantee it would work.

466
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,316
Some patients are lucky,

467
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:42,153
but in your case, it didn't work.

468
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,365
What about IVF?

469
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,203
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Palacios,

470
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:55,082
but it will take a miracle
for you to bear a child.

471
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,003
There's really nothing we can do.

472
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,048
Nothing?

473
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,510
Doc, money is not an issue.

474
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,221
If I need to spend millions of pesos

475
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:11,766
for me to get pregnant, go!

476
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,060
If I need to dance in Obando,

477
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:15,311
no problem, I will do that.

478
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:19,357
I just really need to produce
a baby for my husband.

479
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:21,400
I don't want him to leave me, Doc.

480
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:24,403
I don't want him to replace me
with someone else.

481
00:39:24,987 --> 00:39:26,655
Well…

482
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,367
if you really want to have a child…

483
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,633
I'm sorry, Doc,
but adoption is not an option.

484
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,302
I don't want to adopt.

485
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:53,808
I want someone of our flesh and blood.
I want our own baby.

486
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,569
I'm sorry, Mrs. Palacios…

487
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:09,115
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

488
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,079
Are you Rebecca's personal bodyguard?

489
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,583
Oh my gosh.

490
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:23,421
Are you my cousin's new lover?

491
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,756
Please stop, Basil. Enough.

492
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:28,467
My God, Rebecca.

493
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,261
That's really your type, right?

494
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,345
My God.

495
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:33,848
You're still fond of garbage.

496
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:36,892
What?

497
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,769
Go ahead and show your courage.

498
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,355
- Stop!
- Punch me.

499
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,482
Right here. Punch me.

500
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,818
Come on. Punch me!

501
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,904
Sir, I don't want trouble.

502
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:50,114
You don't want trouble?

503
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:54,452
Punch me. Come on, show me your courage.

504
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,579
Come on! Punch me!

505
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:58,330
- Show me your unruly attitude.
- Please stop them.

506
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:00,207
Hey, stay out of this.

507
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,086
This is between me and this gutter trash.

508
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,546
What?

509
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,714
Punch me!

510
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,178
He doesn't want to. Coward.

511
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,096
Okay.

512
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,389
Hey!

513
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,183
Basil, enough.

514
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,268
You fool!

515
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,436
Basil!

516
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:21,770
Stop it, sir!

517
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:27,193
You jerk! Try to avoid this.

518
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,653
What?

519
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:43,918
Basil, that's enough!

520
00:41:53,552 --> 00:41:55,387
Relax, Dad. Don't worry.

521
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,806
I will not ruin my life
for some stupid help.

522
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,477
My life is much more precious than that.

523
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:05,147
Are you okay?

524
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,485
Ma'am, don't meddle anymore.

525
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,196
Basil…

526
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:13,447
Basil!

527
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,950
What the hell are you doing?

528
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:19,745
Why are you fighting with our helpers?

529
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:21,205
Relax, Dad.

530
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:23,290
No one got hurt.

531
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,960
I'm just playing with them.

532
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:28,504
You can't be hot-headed all the time.

533
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,799
It's unbecoming of a future COO.

534
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,678
Says the person
who never had a chance to be one!

535
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,179
You bastard!

536
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:40,975
Well, what else would I be?

537
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,479
Like father, like son!

538
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:50,818
Those rich people
are really something else.

539
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,904
Poor people like us
are just their punching bags.

540
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,076
Don't worry.

541
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,327
It will soon end.

542
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,456
Are you okay?

543
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,647
<i>I'm really sorry, Mrs. Palacios,</i>

544
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:55,526
<i>but it will take a miracle</i>
<i>for you to bear a child.</i>

545
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,523
You raped her! You're a rapist!

546
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:35,899
My father is not a rapist!

547
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:38,068
Maybe it was your mother
who went after my father!

548
00:45:38,152 --> 00:45:39,611
You know, because she had
an itch to scratch!

549
00:45:39,695 --> 00:45:42,489
See you in court or see you in hell!

550
00:45:44,741 --> 00:45:46,493
I'd love to meet your wife.

551
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:48,078
- Where is she?
- Let me go and get her.

552
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,288
- I'm here.
- My wife.

553
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,791
You know each other?

554
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:54,960
She's the best friend I told you about.

555
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,795
My ex-best friend.

556
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,213
- George?
- Excuse me.

557
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,844
- What happened?
- Ma'am, it's because…

558
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:05,220
What did you do to my mother?

559
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:07,556
If you're mad at me, hurt me,
not my mother!

560
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:09,266
Your mother is so stupid!

561
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:12,811
How dare you?!

562
00:46:12,895 --> 00:46:14,688
- You're so shameless!
- You're shameless!

563
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,533
Death card.

564
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:27,784
It's another death.

565
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,286
What does that mean?

566
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,704
Someone else will die.

567
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,873
<i>I almost got run over earlier.</i>

568
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:34,208
I have a feeling
it was done intentionally.

569
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,335
Did you see who it was?

570
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:39,463
Where were you at around 7:00 p.m.?

571
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:40,631
I think this is too much.

572
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:41,715
No, no, it's okay.

573
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:43,967
I added some more for your shopping
allowance and our daughter's.

574
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,804
I want both of you to look presentable
at Basil's birthday party.

575
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:52,601
I would rather stay at home than attend
one of your stupid little parties.

576
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:53,519
Sofia!

577
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,229
Don't release my video.

578
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:58,524
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

579
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:02,778
Because tonight, George will die.

580
00:47:02,861 --> 00:47:06,657
- What the hell is this?
- What happened?

581
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,909
NEXT EPISODE

582
00:47:08,992 --> 00:47:10,911
- Basil!
- Basil!

583
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,746
<i>Who poisoned Sir Basil?</i>

584
00:47:12,829 --> 00:47:14,790
A beast did this to Basil!

585
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:19,628
I will personally kill the person
who killed my son-in-law!

586
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:21,505
Sir, someone is looking for you.

587
00:47:22,297 --> 00:47:23,048
Why?

588
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:25,842
I know something that might possibly
help with Sir Basil's case.

589
00:47:25,926 --> 00:47:28,220
We have new evidence that points
to a new suspect.

590
00:47:28,303 --> 00:47:30,722
- Who?
- Mr. Francis Castillo.

591
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:38,647
- No, don't! Don't, please!
- It's you who should die!

592
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:41,358
Don't! Ma'am!
Don't, please, ma'am!
