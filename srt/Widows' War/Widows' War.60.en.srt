1
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:15,682
Sofia, what really happened?

2
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,059
Sofia, please. Tell them the truth.

3
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,812
- Please.
- Mommy, I'm so sorry.

4
00:00:20,895 --> 00:00:22,939
I can't do this anymore.

5
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:26,401
Let's not change the story
and just admit the truth.

6
00:00:26,484 --> 00:00:28,403
Is Rebecca your daughter with Orly?

7
00:00:28,486 --> 00:00:29,487
Yes.

8
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:33,158
Orly and I have a daughter,
and it's Rebecca.

9
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:37,495
I am not the Palacios killer
and I'm not the mastermind.

10
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,165
I have nothing to do with those killings.

11
00:00:40,248 --> 00:00:43,084
Believe me. Don't turn the tables
on me, Sofia.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,295
I am innocent.

13
00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:46,671
Sofia…

14
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:47,797
PREVIOUSLY

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,133
You can clarify the story now.

16
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,343
I want to end this.

17
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,095
Sofia…

18
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,140
So, I'm a problem to you now, Sam?

19
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,434
Mother, that's not what I mean.

20
00:00:59,517 --> 00:01:02,270
What I mean is
let's not make any decisions

21
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:03,897
that we haven't thought about

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,107
because I have a lot
of problems right now.

23
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,778
And there's a possibility
that Ms. Vivian killed Francis.

24
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,279
What?

25
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:13,281
Is it Vivian who ran over Francis?

26
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:16,659
And you're focusing
on your Dad's illegitimate daughter?

27
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,912
What kind of sister are you?

28
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,374
Mother, what do you want me to do?

29
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,585
Attack Ms. Vivian, is that it?

30
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,796
She's now being investigated
by the police.

31
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:31,758
I don't want to accuse anyone anymore
like I did to Ward.

32
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:33,218
Because what happened?

33
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:35,637
George and I only fought.

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:37,722
She had a miscarriage, right?

35
00:01:37,806 --> 00:01:41,309
I'm not telling you to attack Vivian.

36
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,895
But, my point is,

37
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,606
your brother died

38
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,193
and yet you're focusing on someone else.

39
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,445
It seems you don't care about Francis.

40
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,739
Mother, I care about Francis.

41
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,826
Not a single day goes by
that I don't think of him.

42
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,411
What I want is to give him justice.

43
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,497
But, Mother…

44
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,166
I don't want to pinpoint anyone else.

45
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,754
Especially as I know that the person
behind all of this is Mom Aurora.

46
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,801
And, Mother,
Rebecca is not a stranger to me.

47
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,970
She's also my sister.

48
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:19,722
She's a product
of your father's infidelity.

49
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:22,142
If you're not hurting
and you accept Rebecca, fine.

50
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:25,228
But, I can never accept her.

51
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,938
Mother… Mother?

52
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:28,439
I want to be alone.

53
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,358
Let's talk some other time.

54
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:42,912
Sofia.

55
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:44,956
Sofia, get out of there.

56
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,501
You don't have to answer Sergeant Royales.

57
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:51,337
Open this door, Sofia.

58
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,888
Hey, you. What are you all looking at?

59
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,599
- You're all gossipmongers, huh?
- Ms. Vivian. That's enough.

60
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,225
- Get out.
- Ms. Vivian, stop it.

61
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:07,061
You're happy with
what's happening to me, huh?

62
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:08,771
Ms. Vivian, stop it.

63
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:11,024
Cairo…

64
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,068
Give me the key to the door.

65
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,195
Come on, I need to get Sofia.

66
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,322
Come on, Cairo.

67
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:22,660
Ms. Vivian, Sofia volunteered
to talk to them.

68
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,537
There's nothing we can do about that.

69
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,080
You too.

70
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,586
Ma'am Sam…

71
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:34,422
Did you and Ma'am Mercy fight?

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,385
We just had an argument.

73
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,847
Jericho…

74
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,559
Mom Aurora already confessed

75
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,812
that Rebecca is her daughter with Dad.

76
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,277
So, my suspicion is true.

77
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,447
Rebecca is Ma'am Aurora's daughter.

78
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,284
What?

79
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:07,664
Sam…

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,626
I have known for a long time
that Rebecca and I are not siblings.

81
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,255
When we had a DNA test,

82
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,799
it showed that Rebecca and I

83
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,926
are related, but not siblings.

84
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:24,305
That means we have different parents.

85
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,522
Sofia… Sofia…

86
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,610
Sofia, my child. What did you tell them?

87
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:42,448
What did you do inside? What?

88
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:46,953
You. What did you tell my daughter?

89
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,415
I just repeated the questions
to her, Ms. Trano.

90
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,209
And she told the truth,

91
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:57,755
that you didn't see the gas mask
inside the box together.

92
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,633
What's that?

93
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:01,968
What's that box behind you?

94
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,094
Nothing.

95
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:05,221
You're clearly hiding something from me.

96
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,598
It's a holiday gift.

97
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,437
My surprise for you
because it's the holidays, right?

98
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:25,116
And you forced her to agree to lie

99
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,660
to convince us that you were set up.

100
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,205
Go ahead, Ms. Trano.
I'll give you a chance.

101
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,376
Let's talk again,
but I want you to tell the truth.

102
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:41,591
Even if I had doubts about Ma'am Aurora,

103
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,136
I didn't correct the DNA test results.

104
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:49,515
In my mind, I was protecting Rebecca.

105
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,226
But, it's wrong

106
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:55,563
because it seems I'm protecting
Auntie Aurora.

107
00:05:57,356 --> 00:05:59,484
If only I had known the truth,

108
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:01,360
then maybe…

109
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,655
the truth about her daughter
with Doc Orly would come out…

110
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,366
It's Rebecca.

111
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,120
Sam, I'm sorry.

112
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,961
It's right that you protected Rebecca.

113
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,966
But, I hope you didn't
involve her in your lies.

114
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,096
And Jericho, I asked you

115
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,099
why the DNA results showed
you were siblings, remember?

116
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:32,975
And you said you didn't know.

117
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:39,232
I'm sorry, I really didn't know
that you are Rebecca's sibling.

118
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,652
That's why I didn't say a word.

119
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,114
But, Sam. I'm on your side.

120
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:49,200
I'm not the enemy here.

121
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,953
You and Rebecca are still my family.

122
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,375
No. I don't want to.

123
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,584
Mommy,

124
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,421
Sergeant Royales is giving you
a chance to come clean.

125
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:04,966
If you do not cooperate,
they will file obstruction of justice

126
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,218
and coercion cases against you.

127
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:09,262
I understand you, Miss Trano.

128
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:13,266
I have investigated
a lot of innocent people.

129
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,227
They lie because they are scared
to be pinned down.

130
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,229
That's the reason we are here,

131
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,524
for us to investigate,
so the truth comes out.

132
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,360
All you have to do is be honest.

133
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:32,618
I will no longer allow you
to talk to us without a lawyer.

134
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:35,872
Let's go.

135
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,011
What's happening?

136
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:55,766
Are you okay?

137
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:57,935
Sam, the baby.

138
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,563
Sit down first.

139
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:06,277
I told you, you're stressing yourself out.

140
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,070
This is not healthy anymore.

141
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,906
Come on. Let's go
for a checkup with Dr. Flores.

142
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:12,825
Isn't it late?

143
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:17,288
Didn't I tell you
that my OB is available for me anytime?

144
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,624
That's why we should go.
I need to make sure that my baby…

145
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,252
my godchild is well and fine.

146
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,754
Let's go. Don't object anymore.

147
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:26,923
I will drag you.

148
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,341
I'll drive for you.

149
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:30,176
No need, Jericho.

150
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:34,263
I'll take care of this.
Bill is there. He can drive for us.

151
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:36,516
Let's go.

152
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,790
General Alejaga, please…

153
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,378
Do everything you can to find Rebecca.

154
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:09,048
And if you find her, bring her to me,

155
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:10,383
not to Aurora.

156
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,177
- Mom, please.
- Thank you.

157
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,096
Please, just talk to Sergeant Royales.

158
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,139
No, Sofia. I said, no.

159
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,767
What are you two fighting about?

160
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:21,978
Well,

161
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,773
it's because this good daughter
of yours betrayed me.

162
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,402
That's why now, Galvan,
you need to help me.

163
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:32,196
You need to give me a good lawyer.

164
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,907
Mommy I didn't betray you.

165
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:37,743
I was just telling the truth.
I believe you.

166
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:38,953
I know that you're innocent.

167
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,039
But, just like Sergeant Royales said,

168
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:45,334
we don't have to lie
just to prove that you are innocent.

169
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,752
Wait.

170
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,715
You made my daughter lie for you?

171
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,260
You're really a worthless mother.

172
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,898
Amando.

173
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:14,697
For not protecting me from Galvan.

174
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,620
For allowing that vile hag, Mercy,

175
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:24,665
to come near me and threaten
to spit on my face.

176
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,169
You deserved that.

177
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,881
Mercy should have spat on you.

178
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:34,967
Amando…

179
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:42,099
Did I freaking hear you right, Amando?

180
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:44,018
Yes.

181
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:46,771
You really deserve that

182
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,148
because you're too much.

183
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,069
Rebecca is your daughter with Orly,

184
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,404
and you kept it a secret.

185
00:10:56,197 --> 00:10:57,990
You introduced her as your niece.

186
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,161
What kind of a mother can do that?

187
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:05,331
Don't question my motherhood, Amando.

188
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,334
I didn't lack love for Rebecca.

189
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,128
How can you call that love

190
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:15,674
when you can't even tell her
that you're her real mother?

191
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,512
You hid it from her…

192
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:22,973
that she's your daughter
with that jerk, Orly.

193
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,394
You fooled Rebecca.

194
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,106
You fooled the people around you.

195
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,068
You fooled me.

196
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,531
No, Galvan. I'm sorry.

197
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,032
I just panicked.

198
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,034
Yes, I made a mistake.

199
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,412
I didn't mean it.

200
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,831
But, you need to help me, Galvan.

201
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,166
Sofia, help me.

202
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,252
I need someone who can testify

203
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:54,171
that piece of evidence
was planted in my things.

204
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:55,923
Vivian…

205
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,677
You don't need someone to help you.

206
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,637
The truth will come out.

207
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,473
So, you'd better confess.

208
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,725
No one framed you.

209
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,103
It was you who ran over Francis.

210
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,646
You're the Palacios killer.

211
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:11,856
You're the mastermind.

212
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:15,151
No, Galvan. No. No.

213
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,028
How many times must I tell you
that I was just framed?

214
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,989
I am not lying.

215
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,742
Please, help me. I need a lawyer.

216
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,619
I need to prove myself.

217
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:29,457
No, Galvan. Help me. I need a lawyer.

218
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:33,919
Dad, let's give Mommy a chance
to come clean.

219
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,672
Please, help her.

220
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:38,424
God.

221
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,260
This is just not about Rebecca.

222
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,097
This is about the fact
that Orly and I had a child

223
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:48,809
that you can't accept
because before and up to now,

224
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:51,061
you're so jealous of him.

225
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,774
I don't deny that.

226
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,403
I loved you…

227
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,406
and I almost died…

228
00:13:05,242 --> 00:13:07,411
whenever I saw you together.

229
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,250
But, this is no longer
about Orly and Rebecca.

230
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:15,544
What Amando?

231
00:13:16,837 --> 00:13:18,756
What else is your issue here?

232
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,132
What?

233
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,387
Galvan…

234
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,431
- Sergeant Royales.
- Sir?

235
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,563
Do what you have to do with this woman.

236
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:38,400
Arrest her. Sue her.

237
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,361
I don't care.

238
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:43,113
Just take her away from me
and my daughter.

239
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,626
What, Amando? Go ahead and talk. Tell me.

240
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:57,670
What else is your issue?

241
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,046
It's about our son.

242
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,678
If you didn't…

243
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:10,933
tell Rebecca that you're her real mother,

244
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,644
with Paco,

245
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,148
you never told him…

246
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,067
that I was his real father.

247
00:14:24,572 --> 00:14:25,906
Why, Aurora?

248
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,159
Why?

249
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,043
I will not arrest you, Ms. Trano.

250
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:42,256
Just come with me.
We will just talk to clear things up.

251
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,967
I will not go with you…

252
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,970
until I have a lawyer with me.

253
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,430
Do you understand?

254
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,313
Are you are really heartless, Galvan?

255
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,857
Maybe this is really what you want…

256
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,484
For me to rot in jail.

257
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:04,653
Well, I'm sorry

258
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,699
because you're not the only one
I can ask for help.

259
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:13,621
- Mom…
- Hey, let her be.

260
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,582
I will reschedule the interview tomorrow.

261
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:18,083
You should have a lawyer by then.

262
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:20,753
Yes, I will have one.

263
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:36,352
You know the answer
to that question, Amando.

264
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:41,190
We needed to keep it a secret
that you got me pregnant because for sure,

265
00:15:41,690 --> 00:15:43,817
Dad would have you killed.

266
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,655
But, your dad has been dead
for a long time.

267
00:15:47,738 --> 00:15:50,532
But, Galvan is still here.

268
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:56,705
He would have used our secret
to overthrow me.

269
00:15:57,289 --> 00:16:00,292
God, Amando. Just be thankful…

270
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,004
that you saw your son, Paco, grow up.

271
00:16:07,007 --> 00:16:08,258
Together…

272
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:11,261
as a servant,

273
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,056
as a helper…

274
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,644
as a slave who just followed orders,

275
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:21,689
and not as a father.

276
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:27,569
Do you know how painful that was, Aurora?

277
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,535
I wanted so much to approach Paco…

278
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,497
embrace him,

279
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,001
and call him my son.

280
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,170
But, I can't do it.

281
00:16:47,464 --> 00:16:51,844
How do you think Paco would feel
if you did that?

282
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,681
Yes, Amando, he cared for you.

283
00:16:56,348 --> 00:17:00,561
But, I don't think he would have accepted

284
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,396
that you are his father.

285
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,275
That he is the product of a mistake.

286
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,235
Mistake?

287
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:12,865
- I loved you, Aurora.
- Yes, Amando.

288
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:16,827
But, you knew I could never love you.

289
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:20,289
I am a Palacios

290
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,751
and you said it yourself…

291
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,253
you are just a mere helper.

292
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,184
So, Jericho is really a Palacios.

293
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:41,935
He is Uncle Rodolfo's son.

294
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:46,398
Yes, he just didn't expose it
because he had a deal with Mom Aurora.

295
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,530
Hi.

296
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,200
Sam, here's your ultrasound result.

297
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,201
Thank you.

298
00:17:57,868 --> 00:18:00,746
By the way, I spoke to George.

299
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,375
She actually mentioned
that you've been through a lot of stress…

300
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,130
before your pregnancy, Sam.

301
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:12,382
But, did you know?

302
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:17,429
You're so lucky. Your baby is so strong.

303
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,975
Thank you, Doc.

304
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:26,396
How could you, Amando?

305
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,526
I should have done that a long time ago.

306
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:37,199
I should have told Paco
that I am his real father.

307
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:40,953
I should have taken my son away from you…

308
00:18:42,496 --> 00:18:44,206
Maybe…

309
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,000
Maybe he'd still be alive now.

310
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,298
Amando.

311
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,468
Amando, come back here.

312
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
Amando.

313
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:01,098
Amando, I'm not yet done.

314
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,157
Amando… Amando…

315
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,370
I'm taking good care of my baby.

316
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,747
I've been trying to be healthy

317
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,625
and I take my vitamins regularly.

318
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:33,589
Of course, as much as possible,
you should avoid getting stressed.

319
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,716
Remember…

320
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:40,387
your pregnancy is still
in the second trimester.

321
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:45,267
There's no guarantee
that there's no risk in your pregnancy.

322
00:19:47,269 --> 00:19:50,355
Sam, let me repeat this.

323
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:55,152
Do you really not want to know
if your baby is a boy or a girl?

324
00:19:58,363 --> 00:20:00,741
Call me traditional, Doc, but…

325
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,786
I think I'd rather find out
after I give birth.

326
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:06,997
Okay, no problem.

327
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:09,750
Wait.

328
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:12,377
I need to use the bathroom.
Excuse me. Sorry, George.

329
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,228
Thank you, Kate.

330
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,146
No problem, G.

331
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,316
I can now push through with my plan.

332
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,984
Plan?

333
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:38,237
Sam…

334
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,571
What plan?

335
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:52,751
I left my bag.

336
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,128
George, what plan?

337
00:20:57,923 --> 00:21:02,886
I asked Doc if the baby was a girl or boy.

338
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,389
I wanted to have a gender reveal party.

339
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:10,227
Sam, I hope you don't mind

340
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,645
that I told her.

341
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,565
Sorry, please don't be mad.

342
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:20,320
It's okay. I wondered what
the plan was about.

343
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:23,156
But a party?

344
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,158
George, let's not have a party.

345
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:29,913
I don't think it's right
with everything that's happening.

346
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,666
Please grant my request.

347
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:33,917
I'm just excited.

348
00:21:34,876 --> 00:21:38,005
Because you know,
I wasn't able to give my baby boy a party.

349
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,840
So, I'll just throw one for your baby boy.

350
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:41,883
Oh, my God.

351
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:47,639
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it.

352
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,685
I'm having a baby boy?

353
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:57,441
My baby with Paco

354
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,985
is a boy…

355
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:01,570
I'm having a baby boy.

356
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,572
We're having a baby boy.

357
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:14,666
<i>It's not our baby, Samantha.</i>

358
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,710
<i>It's my baby.</i>

359
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,879
<i>My baby.</i>

360
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,218
So, what now?

361
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,096
Do you know a good lawyer?

362
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:31,641
You don't know one
and yet you talked too much.

363
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,643
I have to go.
You have nothing to contribute.

364
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:36,229
She's annoying. She wasted my time.

365
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,985
Hey, Ruth.

366
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,364
Ruth…

367
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:47,991
Do you know…

368
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,785
Do you know a good lawyer?

369
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,119
Yes, I do.

370
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:53,538
I have a classmate who is a valedictorian.

371
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,748
I'm so close with her.

372
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:56,583
She's an excellent lawyer.

373
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:57,834
- Really?
- Yes.

374
00:22:57,918 --> 00:23:00,754
Ruth, can you recommend me to your friend?

375
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,506
Introduce me to her.

376
00:23:03,131 --> 00:23:04,424
She's busy.

377
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,303
You know, you're really a witch.

378
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:11,223
You told me you know a good lawyer,

379
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:13,183
but you don't want to help me.

380
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:15,602
You asked a question and I answered it.

381
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:18,688
You know, Vivian, I will never help you.

382
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,399
Because if it's true
that you ran over Francis,

383
00:23:21,483 --> 00:23:23,944
there's a possibility
that it was you who framed Ward.

384
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,987
I am innocent.

385
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,781
I don't believe you.

386
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:31,076
Being a killer stinks
out of your character.

387
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:34,287
- Really, now?
- Oh, go on.

388
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:37,290
My fist will hit your thick face.

389
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:38,959
- Go ahead.
- What?

390
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:41,753
- Make the first move and I will finish it.
- No.

391
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,047
I'll let you go first
so you can score a punch.

392
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,590
Because if you let me make the first move,

393
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,551
You will wake up tomorrow.

394
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:48,802
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

395
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:50,595
Yes, go ahead and try. Come on.

396
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:56,935
There's a possibility
that she killed Francis.

397
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:57,978
What?

398
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,189
Francis!

399
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,862
We've given him
the last dose of epinephrine,

400
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,446
but there's no response.

401
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,866
- No…
- Sorry for your loss.

402
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:11,992
Condolences.

403
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,911
No… no…

404
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:16,746
What? Come on. Let's go.

405
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,082
- Make a move.
- I will.

406
00:24:19,166 --> 00:24:20,250
Vivian.

407
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,005
Vivian, was it you who ran my son over?

408
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:29,301
Go ahead, Mercy. Beat this woman.

409
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,513
What? You would gang up on me?

410
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:34,764
Come on.

411
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:35,974
Go ahead and try.

412
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,101
Go ahead and try.

413
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:40,228
Come closer. Come on.

414
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,313
What now?

415
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,148
Ms. Vivian, that's enough.

416
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,232
- No.
- What?

417
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,153
- They started it. They're accusing me.
- Come on, that's enough.

418
00:24:48,236 --> 00:24:50,238
- Oh, no.
- Ms. Vivian, that's enough.

419
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:51,907
Hey, I'm not done with all of you.

420
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:53,283
You fools.

421
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:02,834
What, Sarge?

422
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:06,421
Do we have evidence
that we can use against Vivian Trano?

423
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:11,384
How about the car she rented
that we secured?

424
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,262
Did the crime lab conduct
a chemical analysis

425
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,806
on the rubber particles
that were taken from the skid marks?

426
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,643
And were they able to compare it
with the materials from the car tires?

427
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:20,727
How about wear patterns?

428
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:23,521
These were the skid marks
taken on the Sto. Niño Parish Street

429
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:26,524
and the chemical composition of the tire.

430
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,451
This is the tire
of the car Ms. Trano rented,

431
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:40,288
Including the unique wear
and tear damage of the car.

432
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,873
Hold on…

433
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,336
It's a match.

434
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:50,090
The car rented by Ms. Trano

435
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:52,550
was indeed the car used
to run over Francis Castillo.

436
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,927
Yes, Sarge.

437
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,680
What? Aside from that,
did we get any other evidence?

438
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,893
- You're all ganging up on me.
- Mom, what are you doing?

439
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:03,687
- You don't want to help me.
- Where are you going?

440
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,063
I will leave you.

441
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,857
Why? What do you want me to do?

442
00:26:07,941 --> 00:26:09,192
Just wait here

443
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,777
until the police arrest me?

444
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,030
I will leave you guys. I will go away.

445
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:15,991
Because the car was washed

446
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,450
before it was rented to someone else,

447
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:21,329
and was exposed to the different elements.

448
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,206
A few days before we secured the car,

449
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,041
we encountered a problem
with the forensics.

450
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,878
So, they weren't able to get blood traces
of the victim in the car?

451
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:32,299
When the forensics used luminol compound,

452
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:35,635
we were able to recover
a few traces on the bumper.

453
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:42,767
What's the result of the cross-matching
of Francis' blood sample?

454
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,020
We're still waiting for it, Sarge.

455
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:51,609
You can't leave.

456
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:54,654
I will think that you're not innocent.

457
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:57,282
Tell me the truth,

458
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,326
are you guilty or not?

459
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,620
You talk too much.

460
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:04,497
You're so talkative, Sofia.

461
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:08,293
You know, everything I do

462
00:27:09,336 --> 00:27:10,712
is for you,

463
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,256
so you'll have a better life.

464
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,634
Up till now,

465
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,180
I have suffered nothing
but oppression in my life.

466
00:27:21,181 --> 00:27:23,224
When I was still in my mother's womb,

467
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:26,936
people did nothing but oppress me.

468
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,731
That's why I promised myself

469
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,192
that if I had a child,

470
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:36,905
she would never experience
the hardships I went through.

471
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,158
Your daddy, Galvan,

472
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,953
he did nothing but insult me

473
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:47,207
from head to foot.

474
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:50,043
He spoke badly of me.

475
00:27:50,126 --> 00:27:52,754
And that Basil when he was still alive,

476
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,422
did the same too.

477
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:58,426
And especially that witch, Aurora.

478
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:04,057
She has nothing else to do but belittle me
and degrade my character.

479
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,726
She looks down on me and insults me.

480
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:07,811
I don't want it anymore.

481
00:28:08,728 --> 00:28:10,605
Sir, from the forensic.

482
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:11,606
Thanks, Sarge.

483
00:28:26,538 --> 00:28:29,833
The blood samples found on the car
belong to Francis Castillo.

484
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,752
Okay, Sarge, I'll secure a warrant

485
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,963
for the immediate arrest of Ms. Trano.

486
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:35,880
Okay.

487
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:41,761
That's why that's not acceptable.

488
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:44,597
Mom, you haven't answered my question.

489
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,100
What?

490
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:48,601
Are you innocent or not?

491
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,395
Tell me.

492
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,066
Yes, Sofia.

493
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,611
Because I'm fed up

494
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,574
of being oppressed.

495
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,451
That's why, yes,

496
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:09,914
I ran over Francis.

497
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:12,208
But, it should have been Mercy.

498
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,794
Because I wanted them…

499
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,964
to accuse Aurora

500
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:20,425
and put her behind bars.

501
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:24,053
I wanted to get revenge on that woman.

502
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,389
But what did Francis do?

503
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:29,350
He tried to be a hero.

504
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,644
He wanted to be a smart aleck
and blocked the way.

505
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:34,272
So there, he was hit.

506
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,399
That's not my fault.

507
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,487
But, Sofia. I am not the Palacios killer,

508
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:44,407
and I am not the mastermind.

509
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:48,203
I only killed Francis.

510
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,414
Mom, just please tell me
that you're lying.

511
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,208
Tell me that you're lying. Come on.

512
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,253
You want the truth, right?

513
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,506
There you go.

514
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,217
I'm giving you the truth.

515
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,387
Why does it seem like…
you don't believe it?

516
00:30:06,888 --> 00:30:09,098
Isn't that what you want? The truth?

517
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:22,529
Cairo, Ma'am Vivian confessed to Sofia.

518
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,700
Please tell me, Mom,
you didn't kill Francis.

519
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,619
Why did you do it?

520
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,747
Why did you do it, Mom? Why did you do it?

521
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:33,873
Tell me.

522
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,334
Shut up.

523
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,254
You, shut up.

524
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:41,714
You know what?

525
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,842
If you want to help me,

526
00:30:43,925 --> 00:30:45,301
help me escape.

527
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,264
That's what you can do for your mother
who made sacrifices for you.

528
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:50,557
Help me escape.

529
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,058
Stop crying.

530
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:54,435
I will not help you.

531
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,771
- I won't allow you.
- What do you mean?

532
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,690
You have to tell Sergeant Royales
what you have done.

533
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,984
You have to explain to him
and admit to him.

534
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,861
Wow, admit to him?

535
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,780
What do you think of me?
That I'm stupid like you?

536
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,740
Hey, Sofia. I'm not stupid.

537
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,409
You. You're the stupid one.

538
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:14,455
And what do you think?
If I do that, what will they do to me?

539
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:17,876
They will arrest me and put me in jail.

540
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,753
That's why I won't allow it.
No, they can't.

541
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,171
I won't allow it.

542
00:31:22,755 --> 00:31:24,966
You're not leaving. You have to stay.

543
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,427
This is bad, Mom. You have to stay.

544
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,888
- What do you mean?
- Mom, you can't leave.

545
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,639
What do you mean bad, huh?

546
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:33,266
Go bad your face.

547
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,395
Damn you.

548
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,439
I'm fed up with your excuses.

549
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,191
Find Rebecca and bring her to me.

550
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,027
I'm serious, Susan.

551
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,821
I'll shut down your facility.

552
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,667
Good morning, Ma'am.

553
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,461
Here's your coffee.

554
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:11,846
What are you smiling about, Rico?

555
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,557
Cairo called me.

556
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:17,810
It's confirmed that it was Ma'am Vivian
who ran over Francis.

557
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,563
You'll be cleared
of Ma'am Sam's accusation.

558
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,608
And should I be happy, Rico?

559
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,360
I'm really innocent.

560
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,904
That Sam is just pissing me off.

561
00:32:27,987 --> 00:32:29,864
I don't care about that.

562
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,409
What I'm concerned about now is Rebecca.

563
00:32:33,993 --> 00:32:35,495
Now scram. Go.

564
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,871
I'm sorry.

565
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:51,678
Rebecca, my child. Please come home.

566
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,305
Come home safe.

567
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:59,477
I've already lost Paco and your dad.

568
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:02,647
Don't tell me I'll lose you too, my child.

569
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,315
Okay?

570
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,361
You're so sweet there.

571
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,995
I'm sure you've received my text
in our group chat.

572
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,289
What now? There's a winner in our bet.

573
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,251
Wait, what do you mean there's a winner?

574
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,462
Our deal is guessing
who the mastermind is.

575
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:31,092
Ma'am Vivian only confessed
to running Francis over.

576
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:33,636
Yes, that's our bet.

577
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:36,431
That's automatic already.

578
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,349
She's holding the mask
of the Palacios killer.

579
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:41,060
Hey, no cheating here.

580
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,228
Wait.

581
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,188
What do you mean cheating?

582
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,983
Let's just wait
for Sergeant Royales' investigation

583
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:49,652
on who the mastermind is
before you collect payment.

584
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,779
You're a bunch of fools.

585
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:54,490
- Give me my money.
- Hey, what's with you?

586
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,284
You, where's my money?

587
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,162
You're a jerk.
Are you hungry for money, Bill?

588
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,164
What did you say?

589
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,333
That's enough. That's enough.

590
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,752
Stop it.

591
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:06,669
Hey.

592
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,921
You're stubborn!

593
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,214
You're so stubborn.

594
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:20,892
Hey, Ando. Stop it.

595
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,685
You fool.

596
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,271
Hey. Why are you fighting?

597
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,814
Hey, Ando.

598
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:38,826
Boo.

599
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,205
The hell?

600
00:34:42,288 --> 00:34:43,873
Damn you, Barry.

601
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:47,168
Do that again and I'll have you exorcised.

602
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,879
What are you doing here?

603
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:50,797
Oh, God…

604
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,425
I'm here to pick you up
because we have a meeting.

605
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,136
Don't tell me you've forgotten about it.

606
00:34:58,012 --> 00:35:02,642
Anyway, you little liar.

607
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,310
So…

608
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:09,232
It's true that Rebecca is your daughter

609
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,611
and I assume with Orly?

610
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,081
Simon…

611
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,541
Leave us.

612
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,878
My goodness, Aurora.

613
00:35:32,046 --> 00:35:34,257
I feel so offended.

614
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:39,262
All this time,
I thought I was your most trusted friend

615
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,889
for you to tell all your secrets to.

616
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,350
I always ask you about Rebecca

617
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,644
and you always deny it.

618
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:51,941
I had no choice before, Barry.

619
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,442
I had to.

620
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,736
You had to?

621
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,823
Auro, let me remind you,

622
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:02,160
when you had
the illicit love affair with Orly,

623
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,579
your father was already gone.

624
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:10,918
You were already a full,
independent, single woman.

625
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,798
But, I was annulled at that time, Barry.

626
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,051
Orly was still married to Mercy.

627
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,471
I can't afford…

628
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:26,225
to involve the Palacios name
in any scandal.

629
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,560
That's why…

630
00:36:28,811 --> 00:36:32,356
I had to hide the truth about Rebecca.

631
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,279
Ando. Stop that.

632
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:39,780
- Ando.
- You fool.

633
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,449
I said stop it. What's with you?

634
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,868
Cairo. Bill, that's enough.

635
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,206
Why are you fighting here?

636
00:36:48,915 --> 00:36:50,166
Bill is a jerk.

637
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,001
He's collecting payment for our bet.

638
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,461
Fools.

639
00:36:53,961 --> 00:36:56,464
Instead of sending your money
to your families,

640
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,840
you use it for gambling?

641
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,842
What are you betting on?

642
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:03,137
Who the mastermind
of the Palacios killer is.

643
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,222
And Bill here,

644
00:37:04,305 --> 00:37:08,643
when he found out that Ms. Vivian
was behind Francis' death,

645
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:10,102
he asked us for payment.

646
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:11,646
What?

647
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:14,023
It was Ms. Vivian who ran Francis over?

648
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:16,317
Yes, she confessed to Sofia.

649
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,152
Does Uncle Galvan know?

650
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,072
Son of a…

651
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,698
Stop that.

652
00:37:30,373 --> 00:37:36,462
Well, if you really have to hide the truth
about you and Rebecca from the public,

653
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:40,925
then you have an obligation
to tell me all your secrets

654
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,261
because I am your best friend.

655
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:45,554
Remember?

656
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:48,140
We even made a pinky promise…

657
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:51,811
You, me, and Larry.

658
00:37:51,894 --> 00:37:56,357
And it was also a part
of our lifelong friendship's oath.

659
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,566
Remember that?

660
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:01,570
Tell no lies, keep no secrets.

661
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,738
Remember?

662
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,201
That's why when I asked you
if you had something to do

663
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,621
with the rumor
about my husband having an affair,

664
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,833
you told me
that you had nothing to do with it.

665
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,751
And I believed you.

666
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,630
I'm sorry.

667
00:38:34,770 --> 00:38:35,771
Uncle Galvan.

668
00:38:36,272 --> 00:38:38,316
- Uncle Galvan.
- What, Jericho?

669
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,192
Did you find Rebecca?

670
00:38:40,276 --> 00:38:43,612
Not yet, but where is Auntie Vivian?

671
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,448
She's in her room. Why?

672
00:38:45,531 --> 00:38:48,492
She already confessed to Sofia
that she ran over Francis.

673
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,785
What?

674
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,204
Vivian.

675
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:55,207
Dad…

676
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:57,835
It's Mommy. She escaped.

677
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,170
What?

678
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,798
Jericho, alert all security. Now.

679
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:03,799
Yes.

680
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,929
Where are you going?

681
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,264
You are still under investigation, right?

682
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,141
Go ahead and come closer.

683
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:15,895
So, you already know that it was Vivian
who ran over your brother?

684
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,606
I told you it wasn't me.

685
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:21,525
Apologize to Aurora now.

686
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:24,695
Auntie Aurora distributed my babies

687
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,991
to Auntie Larry and Auntie Barry.

688
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,701
Oh, my God.

689
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:34,330
I thought it was only Auntie Larry.

690
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:36,415
How can she do that?

691
00:39:36,499 --> 00:39:37,833
What did you say again?

692
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:41,212
That Aurora can't hurt you?

693
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:42,630
I'll do it for her.

694
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,137
And I will avenge her.

695
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:53,140
You have no right to hurt my friend.

696
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,852
<i>My God, my children…</i>

697
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,521
Do you know where they went?

698
00:39:58,604 --> 00:40:01,065
Do you know where
my children are, Attorney?

699
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,149
Rebecca.

700
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,026
My children…

701
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:07,029
Will you let them destroy your character,

702
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,490
so you can never recover your children?

703
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,492
Don't give them the power.

704
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:15,246
Think about your children
that they took from you.

705
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,956
Focus on that.

706
