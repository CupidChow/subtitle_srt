1
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,693
<i>Until when do you feel the pain</i>
<i>of losing a child?</i>

2
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:10,361
<i>I think it will never end.</i>

3
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:13,531
<i>The pain will stay right here</i>
<i>as long as we live.</i>

4
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:17,452
<i>It hurts because we know that</i>
<i>we'll never see them again.</i>

5
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:20,789
It hurts because we will never
embrace them again.

6
00:01:21,372 --> 00:01:22,832
Do me a favor then.

7
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,793
Preserve my son.

8
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,753
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,837
Preserve? How?

10
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:30,548
Preserve my son
just like your taxidermies.

11
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:33,551
- Are you out of your mind? No!
- Aurora, please.

12
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,929
I still want to be able to see Basil.

13
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,807
<i>I still want to be with him.</i>

14
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:40,391
<i>Please.</i>

15
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:43,102
<i>- Please, I'm begging you.</i>
<i>- No. No.</i>

16
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:44,521
<i>- Please!</i>
<i>- I won't do that!</i>

17
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,190
<i>Please, preserve my son!</i>

18
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,693
<i>Galvan, please stop.</i>

19
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,488
<i>Ms. Samantha, where are you going?</i>

20
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,908
I left my cell phone at the party.

21
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,493
Didn't we tell everyone

22
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,328
<i>that no one is allowed to enter</i>
<i>the crime scene?</i>

23
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:02,580
Did Mr. Palacios use one of those glasses?

24
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,415
- Hopefully, sir.
- Any other evidence?

25
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:05,500
What about his cell phone?

26
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,252
Maybe we can find a lead from that.

27
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:08,586
That's the problem.

28
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:13,383
We didn't find anything in the hospital
or on the stage.

29
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,051
Sam.

30
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,719
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,304
They already told you that
this area is prohibited.

32
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:20,932
- Why are you being so stubborn?
- I'm looking for my cell phone.

33
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:24,269
We need Mr. Palacios' cell phone
to look for possible leads.

34
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,688
Your husband's cell phone wasn't
among his possessions.

35
00:02:26,771 --> 00:02:29,023
<i>We need permission to search the premises.</i>

36
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,859
Fine, let's look for it.

37
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:39,200
Sarge!

38
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,037
Mrs. Palacios, why do you have
morphine in your drawer?

39
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,206
I don't know. It's not mine!

40
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,541
I'm not that stupid.

41
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:49,294
If that was mine,
I wouldn't be letting you see it.

42
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:51,421
Someone might be framing me up.

43
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:55,341
<i>Maybe it's Basil's killer</i>
<i>who put that in my drawer.</i>

44
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,969
<i>I will follow your orders, Basil.</i>

45
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,514
<i>But I will make sure it's you</i>
<i>who will go to jail.</i>

46
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:05,101
<i>You will be accused of killing George.</i>

47
00:03:13,943 --> 00:03:17,196
If only you'd agreed
to preserve Basil, Aurora,

48
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,407
I wouldn't have to go through this.

49
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,784
I could have just put him
somewhere near me.

50
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,208
Shut it, Galvan.

51
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:33,796
Someone might hear you
and say you're going crazy.

52
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:51,898
Oh, Basil…

53
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,943
My son…

54
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:58,279
Basil, my son…

55
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,951
My son.

56
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,792
My son.

57
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:12,210
My son.

58
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:20,635
Basil, my son.

59
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,526
Francis, may I have some?

60
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,196
Sam, what happened to you?

61
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,532
Are you okay? Where did you come from?

62
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,370
Sam…

63
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,998
Sam, what's happening?

64
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:35,501
You know I'm getting worried
about you and the baby.

65
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:38,629
If there's something you want to tell me,
I'm here for you.

66
00:05:38,713 --> 00:05:40,298
I'll listen to you,
whatever that is about.

67
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:00,359
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

68
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,243
This doesn't look like a death threat.

69
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:14,874
More of like a poison letter
against your husband

70
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,585
to destroy his relationship with you.

71
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,712
Well, call it whatever you want.

72
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,507
Just trace where it came from

73
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,176
so we can find out who poisoned
my husband.

74
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,514
Ma'am, we don't know yet
if this is connected to the murder.

75
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:31,516
The letter is addressed to you.

76
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:36,562
Maybe that was the killer's way
of diverting attention away from Basil.

77
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,649
So security around my husband would be
lax, and he could be killed more easily.

78
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:43,111
Oh my God.

79
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:48,241
I could be the reason why my husband died.

80
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,121
After I almost got hit,

81
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,499
I demanded closed-in security.

82
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,251
Oh my God.

83
00:06:58,334 --> 00:06:59,544
I'm so selfish.

84
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:00,962
I was only thinking about myself.

85
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:05,842
I didn't even wonder if my husband
was facing death threats too.

86
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,554
What made you say that?

87
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,891
Remember a few days ago,
I told you I saw Basil?

88
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,893
That he was talking secretly to someone?

89
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,063
I know.

90
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,359
Stupid girl.

91
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,156
I couldn't hear them, but it seemed like
they were talking about serious matters.

92
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,784
I'm getting scared.

93
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:34,829
Maybe…

94
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,706
Maybe I'll be the next target.

95
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,832
George…

96
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,544
Listen to me.

97
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:43,880
Don't worry.

98
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,966
I won't let anything happen to you.

99
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:48,259
I'll take care of you.

100
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,012
Okay?

101
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,370
Nothing.

102
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:19,290
Maybe it's really like this
when you're pregnant.

103
00:08:19,373 --> 00:08:22,376
You're a bit moody.

104
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,754
And emotional.

105
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,343
Basil is already in the funeral chapel.
Let's go and see him.

106
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:34,138
Sam, Mother and Ms. Ruth are going
to see each other if we go there.

107
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,765
They'll just create a scene.

108
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:38,351
We can't just not show up there.

109
00:08:38,434 --> 00:08:40,478
Let's just avoid the Balays.

110
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:42,939
Go ahead and look for Mother.

111
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,024
- I'll start preparing.
- Sam, wait.

112
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:47,777
Are you sure nothing's wrong?

113
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:51,572
It's fine.

114
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:54,158
Whatever it is, I won't make you tell me.

115
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:57,870
But let me remind you that I hope

116
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,289
you won't give George a reason
to fight with us.

117
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:30,236
We won't let anything bad happen to you.

118
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:34,407
But then again, we still have to check
if your statements are true.

119
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,996
Of course I'm telling you the truth.
Why would I make all of that up?

120
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,831
Well, there's a possibility

121
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:46,294
that it could be an alibi to justify
you having morphine in your possession.

122
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:48,713
Are you saying that I poisoned my husband?

123
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:52,008
You can think whatever you want to think,

124
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:53,676
but I loved my husband.

125
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,345
So go ahead, check the whole estate.

126
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:00,516
Look for his cell phone
so you won't suspect only me.

127
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,614
What are you looking at, Villa?

128
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,240
Nothing, sir.

129
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,203
It's like you've known each other
for a long time.

130
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:24,415
So what if we have known each other
for a long time?

131
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:27,001
I'm trying to be professional here.

132
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,295
Is there a problem?

133
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,354
Casas.

134
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,023
Okay, thank you.

135
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,487
The wine glass that
Mr. Palacios used was found.

136
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,073
There are two sets of fingerprints.

137
00:10:57,156 --> 00:10:58,699
Two sets?

138
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,494
So, one of those may belong to the killer.

139
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,498
Ward!

140
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,999
What do you think?

141
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,377
Do I look perfect?

142
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:13,381
Can I keep up with the millionaire friends
of the Palacios'?

143
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,132
Well? Do I look okay?

144
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:18,636
We're going to a wake, not a party.

145
00:11:18,719 --> 00:11:20,721
Hey, go and get dressed!

146
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,020
George.

147
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,191
Well, George? Did you find Basil's phone?

148
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,651
No.

149
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:36,070
But they found morphine in my drawer.

150
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:37,154
What?

151
00:11:37,238 --> 00:11:39,407
Now I have a feeling that they're
looking at me as a suspect.

152
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,200
Wait, George.

153
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:42,993
Why did they find morphine
in your possession?

154
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:45,162
Isn't that what was used to
poison your husband?

155
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:46,831
Mother, it's not mine.

156
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,583
I don't know how it got in with my things!

157
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,211
What? So what now?

158
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,259
Hello, Auntie Aurora?

159
00:11:59,927 --> 00:12:01,095
Yes.

160
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:04,515
Yes, I'm taking care of
the police officers.

161
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,935
Okay, we're on our way.

162
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,564
Papa needs me at the wake.

163
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:28,539
If I hadn't called you,
you wouldn't have rushed over here.

164
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:29,665
Look.

165
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:33,752
Someone else is trying to make a scene
at your husband's wake.

166
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,213
I'm telling you, Georgina,

167
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,798
if you're not careful,

168
00:12:37,882 --> 00:12:39,884
you might lose your position in the estate

169
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,386
because of that mother and her daughter.

170
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,846
Remember,

171
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:45,556
Basil is already gone.

172
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:49,935
Galvan has a pair
of mother-and-daughter leeches

173
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:52,146
trying to suck him dry,

174
00:12:52,646 --> 00:12:55,232
so protect your place.

175
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,901
Because if you don't,

176
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,446
you will go back to the slums
you came from.

177
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:04,408
Go.

178
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:13,125
What's the problem, Mother?

179
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:17,922
Your sister might be a suspect
in Basil's death.

180
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:21,717
Well, Abdul will not forsake her.

181
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:25,095
Abdul loves George so much,

182
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:29,183
so don't worry about the morphine
that they saw in George's things.

183
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,227
Hey, Ward, watch your mouth.

184
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,937
Someone might hear us.

185
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:37,191
Firstly, no one should find out
about that morphine.

186
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:39,276
And secondly, no one should find out

187
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,779
about your sister and Abdul's
relationship!

188
00:13:47,576 --> 00:13:50,913
George is having an affair
with the investigator?

189
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:57,002
Hey, Mercy,

190
00:13:57,086 --> 00:13:58,128
what are you doing there?

191
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,797
Why were you listening
to our conversation?

192
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:02,633
Your voices were loud, just like a radio.

193
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:06,804
Mercy!

194
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,138
- Mercy, wait!
- Auntie Mercy, wait.

195
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:10,766
- Mercy, wait!
- Auntie Mercy, wait!

196
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:12,393
Let's talk first.

197
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:13,644
Mercy, wait.

198
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,020
Let's talk first!

199
00:14:15,104 --> 00:14:17,106
- Mercy! Mercy, hold on!
- Auntie Mercy, hold on!

200
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:25,614
Go and call your sister! Hurry!

201
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,575
Mother, I forgot my phone.

202
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:29,743
Oh my!

203
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,995
No!

204
00:15:35,351 --> 00:15:37,311
Hello, Ward. What is it?

205
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,439
George, it's…

206
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,482
Hello, George?

207
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:44,276
George, Mercy overheard
my conversation with Ward.

208
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,030
I wanted to talk to her and explain
but that fool didn't want to listen!

209
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,992
Mother, what are you talking about?
I can't understand you.

210
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:55,621
She already knows about the morphine
and about your relationship with Abdul!

211
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,164
What?

212
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,627
She thinks that you and Abdul
are still having an affair.

213
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,338
All right, all right, George,
they're already heading to the wake!

214
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,632
Enough of this!
They're on their way there!

215
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:09,134
My God, Mother!

216
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:10,302
<i>George, I'm sorry.</i>

217
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,180
Just wait for them, okay? And make sure
you stay one step ahead of them.

218
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:17,101
<i>Before they expose you to your in-laws,</i>
<i>you have to stop them. Talk to them!</i>

219
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:20,354
<i>Don't let them go near</i>
<i>Sir Galvan and Ma'am Aurora.</i>

220
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:23,232
Okay, George? You take care of that!

221
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:24,650
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

222
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:38,330
Mother, are you sure about what you heard?

223
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:41,959
That George and Sergeant Casas
are in a relationship?

224
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,962
Yes. Why won't you believe me?

225
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,588
Mother, maybe they're just exes.

226
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,051
Why would George have an affair
when her husband was so rich?

227
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,012
What if she was tempted?

228
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,304
Whatever.

229
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:56,181
They were having an affair.

230
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:59,643
And Galvan should know about
the morphine that they found with her.

231
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,604
Mother, please, don't sell
George out to the police.

232
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,691
What's with you, Sam?

233
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,945
After what that woman
and her entire family did to us, to me,

234
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,196
we're just going to keep quiet?

235
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,658
That will also help with Basil's case.

236
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,119
Mother, the morphine isn't hers.

237
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,913
That's why I believe that
she has nothing to do with it.

238
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,665
How can you be so sure?

239
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,125
Sam…

240
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,128
Do you know who poisoned Basil?

241
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,714
Sam?

242
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,592
Do you know something that
you're not telling us?

243
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,660
What are you doing here?

244
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:01,997
Didn't I tell you to take care
of my grieving brother?

245
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:05,167
Georgina, aside from the dead,

246
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,629
widows in mourning are always
the main attraction

247
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,672
in every funeral.

248
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:12,800
So don't wait on anyone.

249
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,719
- But, Auntie…
- Georgina.

250
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,513
Just be with your husband,

251
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,099
and don't let my brother's mistress

252
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:23,268
be a smart aleck at your husband's wake.

253
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,146
Enjoy every moment

254
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:32,736
that I didn't let Sam experience
at my son's wake.

255
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:36,990
Mrs. Palacios, you need to sign
some documents at the office.

256
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,701
Mr. Palacios said you'd take care of it.

257
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,872
Go

258
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:45,958
and do your wife duties.

259
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,167
Now.

260
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:11,024
- Ma.
- Sam.

261
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:14,611
Were you able to rest well?

262
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,572
Did you take your vitamins?

263
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,824
- Yes, Ma.
- Good girl.

264
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:20,909
Ma'am Aurora…

265
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,078
there's something you
and Sir Galvan need to know

266
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,663
about…

267
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,419
- About George.
- Mother.

268
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:31,587
That's enough.

269
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,297
Sam…

270
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,595
What about George, Mercy?

271
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,649
Ma, let's talk about it later.

272
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:54,026
We'll just go to Basil.

273
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,527
Let's go.

274
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,630
Mercy…

275
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:18,592
sit.

276
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,488
Uncle Galvan…

277
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,003
Hello, Mother?

278
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,797
What will I do?

279
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,008
George, whatever happens,

280
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,468
don't admit it.

281
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,470
I can't lie.

282
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,846
Whatever happens,

283
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,807
my past with Abdul will come out.

284
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,184
Okay, you take charge, George.

285
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,436
Just don't let them defeat you.

286
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,938
You didn't do anything wrong.

287
00:21:13,021 --> 00:21:14,856
You and Abdul have called
it quits a long time ago.

288
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,026
And the morphine that poisoned
Basil is not yours.

289
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:19,736
Okay, George?

290
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:24,157
Call Peter so we can go.

291
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:26,285
- He's here. Peter!
- Okay, George.

292
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,828
In a little while, we'll be there.

293
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,121
- Hurry up.
- Okay.

294
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,208
That Mercy should be ready for me.

295
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,460
If I see her, I will pull her hair

296
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:37,546
and her scalp will be removed.

297
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:39,673
Let's go.

298
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,676
Oh.

299
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:46,722
Hey.

300
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,933
Wait son, my dress.

301
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,059
- Yes.
- Okay.

302
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,894
Thank you.

303
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,604
Let's go.

304
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:25,343
Sam.

305
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,973
What expression is that?

306
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,641
Surprise?

307
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,602
Fear?

308
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,520
Or guilt?

309
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:39,149
Because you and your mother
put me in danger.

310
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,333
George…

311
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,796
George, I'm sorry.

312
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,591
I'm sorry, I didn't…

313
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,176
I didn't mean to put you in danger.

314
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:08,178
I'm sorry.

315
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,806
I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to do this to you.

316
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:13,600
You know, your acting is great.

317
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:18,230
If it wasn't for the fact that I saw you
hiding behind your mother earlier

318
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,233
while she was reporting me
to Auntie Aurora,

319
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:25,403
you'd have been able to convince me
of how sorry you are.

320
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:31,827
George, I tried to stop Mother.

321
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,371
Just admit you supported her doing it.

322
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,540
That's why this is what you deserve.

323
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,792
George! Ow!

324
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,418
- George, stop it.
- George!

325
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:46,883
After what you did to my nephew,

326
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:50,137
you want to hurt my grandchild, George?

327
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,226
Auntie Aurora, what are you talking about?

328
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:59,187
Don't act like you don't know.

329
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,356
You poisoned Basil.

330
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:04,526
Because Sergeant Casas is your boyfriend!

331
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,712
Are you having an affair
with Sergeant Casas?

332
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:27,215
Answer me!

333
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,509
Are you having an affair with that man?!

334
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,637
Of course she's having an affair
with Sergeant Casas.

335
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,931
Mercy heard it straight from Ruth.

336
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,103
Did you kill my son?

337
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,981
Yes! She poisoned Basil.

338
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,692
She has morphine in her possession.

339
00:24:50,864 --> 00:24:52,157
What, Galvan?

340
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:54,743
You won't do anything, huh?

341
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,956
If you can't seek revenge against George,

342
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,750
I will do it for you!

343
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:02,751
Come here!

344
00:25:16,806 --> 00:25:19,059
Everybody, come here. Sit down.

345
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:23,438
I need to ask for your cooperation.

346
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,733
We need to get your fingerprints
for our investigation.

347
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:28,109
Is that okay?

348
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,237
You can go first.

349
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:32,656
Villa, what about the guests
that you interviewed?

350
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,742
Okay, sir, I will call them again.

351
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,452
George!

352
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,286
Mother.

353
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,788
Don't touch me, you snake!

354
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,045
Auntie Aurora, don't believe Auntie Mercy.

355
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,464
They are just trying to destroy me.

356
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:53,343
And the morphine that they found
in your possession?

357
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,136
Is that them trying to destroy you too?

358
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,639
It isn't mine!

359
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,391
Someone is framing me up.

360
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,475
Frame up?

361
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:05,188
That's an ancient excuse, George.

362
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,400
You poisoned Basil!

363
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,444
It's not an excuse, Auntie Aurora.

364
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:12,529
It's the truth.

365
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,577
I had no motive to poison Basil.

366
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:21,913
I loved my husband.

367
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:28,586
If you think about it,
you had a bigger motive than me.

368
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,797
What did you say?

369
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:32,090
Get over here!

370
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,216
That's enough!

371
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,302
How dare you say that to me?!

372
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,054
- Please stop!
- You're such a brat!

373
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,514
Stop it, Auntie Aurora!

374
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:42,809
- Stop it!
- How dare you say that to me?

375
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:54,696
Ma'am, your right hand.

376
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,451
All right.

377
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,785
Okay.

378
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:12,589
There.

379
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,507
Jerico?

380
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,384
Are you okay?

381
00:27:33,443 --> 00:27:36,446
You have the nerve to talk back to me?!

382
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:41,326
That's because you're having an affair
with that investigator!

383
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,912
We're not having an affair!

384
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,997
Ma'am Aurora, please stop it!

385
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:49,042
- What do you mean, stop it?
- Aurora, enough!

386
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,126
Enough!

387
00:27:55,965 --> 00:27:57,092
Pa!

388
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,887
I didn't poison Basil.

389
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,937
And Sergeant Casas and I
are not having an affair.

390
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:14,150
You said you'd find Basil's killer,
but it turns out it's you!

391
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:17,278
No, it wasn't me.

392
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,158
And I'll prove it to you.

393
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,985
Why do you have morphine in your drawer?

394
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,362
I don't know. It's not mine.

395
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,323
Look, I'm not that stupid.

396
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:05,285
If that was mine,
I wouldn't be letting you see it.

397
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,513
George…

398
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,057
What now?

399
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:31,603
What if they pin this on you
and have you arrested?

400
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,647
Mother, George is innocent.

401
00:29:34,731 --> 00:29:36,191
She'll be acquitted.

402
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:39,819
But what if Sir Galvan
still won't believe it?

403
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:42,781
What if they throw us out?

404
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,700
I don't want to go back to being poor.

405
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:47,577
I don't want to go back to our old life,

406
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,913
where we couldn't eat
if we didn't borrow money.

407
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:51,414
I don't want that!

408
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:56,211
That's really what you're
thinking about, Mother?

409
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,257
Mother, they don't want me
near my husband,

410
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:04,636
and now I'm even a suspect in his death!

411
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,232
This is all your fault, Mother.

412
00:30:17,315 --> 00:30:18,608
This is Mercy's fault.

413
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:21,402
Both of you are to blame!

414
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,404
You're so talkative!

415
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,825
And now I'm in trouble!

416
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,042
Sam.

417
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,503
Sam.

418
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,348
I found that near your and Paco's bed.

419
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,812
It's not true that it's missing, right?

420
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:43,776
So what were you looking for
at the party venue, Sam?

421
00:31:47,238 --> 00:31:48,281
This.

422
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,785
I found it under the bed yesterday.

423
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:55,038
Sam.

424
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,624
Tell me the truth.

425
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:02,045
Does Basil's death have anything
to do with why you're acting like this?

426
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:33,034
Daddy.

427
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:37,413
Thank you, Sofia.

428
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,384
I can get you some food.
Do you want fries?

429
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,469
- Okay.
- Let's go.

430
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,765
Wait, okay?

431
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:11,197
Mr. Palacios, my condolences.

432
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:34,762
Have you found a replacement investigator,
General Alejaga?

433
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:42,437
If you want to solve your son's case,
don't replace Sergeant Casas.

434
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:45,356
He is very honest and fair.

435
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:48,234
And very good at his job.

436
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,785
I don't care!

437
00:33:57,869 --> 00:33:58,953
Move over, Cairo!

438
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,788
Sir Galvan told us not to let you in.

439
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,416
- I don't care!
- Ma'am, please.

440
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,918
This is my husband's wake.
Let go of me!

441
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,170
Hey, hey, hey!

442
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,171
Please.

443
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,214
Don't make a scene here.

444
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:14,010
Pa.

445
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,095
I have rights regarding my husband!

446
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,931
Please don't prohibit me
from going near him!

447
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:25,188
Cairo, take her away from here

448
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:27,648
if you don't want to lose your job!

449
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:30,651
- Ma'am…
- Let go of me, Cairo!

450
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,819
- Pa!
- You better leave.

451
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,614
- Pa, this is unacceptable!
- Ma'am, I'm sorry.

452
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,199
I have rights regarding my husband!

453
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,450
Let go of me, Cairo!

454
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:38,826
I'm sorry.

455
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,952
Pa!

456
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,348
Why would you ask that?

457
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,061
I'm not sure. I don't know either, Sam.

458
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,147
That's why I'm asking you.

459
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,735
Because ever since the party,
you've been restless.

460
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:16,030
You're always looking for something.
You're always worried.

461
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,490
I don't know why!

462
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:18,866
Maybe…

463
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,037
Maybe Paco's death is all coming back
to me. The trauma, the pain…

464
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,997
I don't know why,
but it's all coming back to me.

465
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,374
Sam, please!

466
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,585
I know you're just making excuses.
What's really the problem?

467
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,920
- What's the problem?
- Nothing!

468
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,547
Why do you keep pressing me?!

469
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,396
Sam, enough.

470
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:50,314
I'm sorry.

471
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:54,610
That's enough, Sam.

472
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:58,114
Even if I force you to, I know…

473
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,075
you won't tell me.

474
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,081
Whatever it is,

475
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,083
if you can no longer take it,

476
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,128
I'm here for you, Sam, okay?

477
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,174
I'm right here.

478
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,595
Hi, Aurora, my sister.

479
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:08,142
I told you a thousand times,
don't call me sister.

480
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:12,396
Even if we count our wrinkles,
you will win.

481
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:15,942
That's because you've had Botox
more times than me.

482
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,485
What did you say?

483
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:45,263
Justice to be done for a dead loved one.

484
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,682
For a dead loved one, justice to be done.

485
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,725
Justice to be done, for a dead loved one.

486
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,436
For a dead loved one, justice to be done.

487
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,938
Justice to be done.

488
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,066
Why are you crying for him, Aurora?

489
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:42,278
You're just wasting your tears.

490
00:38:43,946 --> 00:38:46,157
He's my nephew, Amando.

491
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:49,994
Who had no respect for you,

492
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:54,498
and who wanted to steal Paco's place
in the company.

493
00:38:58,336 --> 00:38:59,962
It's a good thing that he is gone.

494
00:39:01,047 --> 00:39:03,549
He would have stolen your position too.

495
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,132
Hello?

496
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,177
Yes.

497
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:32,972
I'm being careful.

498
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:36,142
Very, very careful.

499
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,686
Okay.

500
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,882
Hey!

501
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:10,718
Sir, they just asked me
to bring them here.

502
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,264
You got scared?

503
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,308
- Louie?
- We got you guys so good!

504
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:18,809
Jeff, Louie!

505
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:21,103
Oh my gosh, I hate you!

506
00:41:21,187 --> 00:41:22,354
I will go ahead.

507
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,440
- All right.
- What are you doing here?

508
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,567
I invited them.

509
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:28,652
Hey, what is this place?

510
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,123
Wow.

511
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,334
Cool, right?

512
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:47,755
It's like it is in those gothic
and murder-mystery books.

513
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,260
Wow, Louie.

514
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,639
It seems like only a little while ago…

515
00:41:59,767 --> 00:42:01,936
that the murder of
your Grandfather Gustavo and Auntie Diana

516
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:03,521
was the hot topic.

517
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:12,363
Now,

518
00:42:12,446 --> 00:42:13,614
this!

519
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:18,118
Wow.

520
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:22,373
This is the second death
at the Palacios' Estate, right?

521
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:29,380
I heard about Mr. Paco.

522
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,508
Didn't his wife become a suspect?

523
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:35,511
And now,

524
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:40,266
it's Mr. Basil's wife who is the suspect.

525
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:43,185
Well, you know.

526
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,020
Usually, that's the case.

527
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:48,732
In the books written by Agatha Christie,

528
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:52,069
- it's always the spouse who's the killer.
- What did you say?

529
00:42:52,152 --> 00:42:54,029
- Hey.
- Oh my.

530
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,197
My sister is not the killer!

531
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,448
- Whoa! Whoa!
- Ward!

532
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,616
Chill, it's fine.

533
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,577
Chill. Sorry. Sorry.

534
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,289
I'm just sharing theories from the cases
I've read about and watched.

535
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:04,623
Don't overreact.

536
00:43:05,541 --> 00:43:06,500
Don't overreact.

537
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,248
So…

538
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:32,795
shall we start?

539
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,220
Go, come on, come on.

540
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:24,555
Go ahead.

541
00:45:24,638 --> 00:45:26,098
Sit there.

542
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,228
Oh.

543
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,232
Okay.

544
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,532
Spirits…

545
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,577
Spirits…

546
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:48,495
Spirits, O hear us.

547
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:50,414
Hear us, O spirits.

548
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,291
Please,

549
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,042
tell us,

550
00:45:54,793 --> 00:45:56,587
who poisoned Basil?

551
00:46:09,099 --> 00:46:11,143
Do you guys really believe in this stuff?

552
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:25,908
We will soon find out
who poisoned Basil.

553
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:27,534
Sir, someone is looking for you.

554
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:28,702
NEXT EPISODE

555
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,287
- Why?
- I know something

556
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:31,872
that might possibly help
with Sir Basil's case.

557
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,666
When Paco died, I saw you grieve.

558
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:38,128
But when Basil died, I saw nothing.

559
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:40,214
Tell me honestly, Amando.

560
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:42,758
Did you poison Basil?

561
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:45,135
What are you doing here?

562
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:47,471
We have new evidence that points
to a new suspect.

563
00:46:47,554 --> 00:46:49,515
- Who?
- Mr. Francis Castillo.

564
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:52,184
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!
I didn't poison him!

565
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,937
- You have the right to remain silent.
- I didn't poison him! Wait! Hold on!

566
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,105
- Animal! You poisoned my son!
- It wasn't me!

567
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:01,985
- Sam!
- Please no!
