1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,682
Are you having an affair with my husband?

2
00:00:15,765 --> 00:00:18,518
Your mother seduced my father,
and now you're trying to do the same.

3
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,353
<i>Your husband is all yours!</i>

4
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:22,480
Don't you dare touch
the mother of my grandchild.

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:24,816
- How's the baby?
- The baby's fine.

6
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,610
The birthday boy himself, Basil Palacios.

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:30,030
Is this a part of your surprise entrance?

8
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:32,323
Ma'am Aurora's entrance is really grand.

9
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:38,747
Ladies and gentlemen, my daughter-in-law,
Samantha Castillo-Palacios,

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:40,498
is pregnant.

11
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:42,167
Goodness, stop drinking.

12
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,461
You're even less likely to get pregnant
if you do that.

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,880
Mother, I already told you,
I can't get pregnant.

14
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:49,674
I can't give Basil a child.

15
00:00:49,758 --> 00:00:51,092
That's your secret.

16
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:52,677
The longer you keep a lie,

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,012
the bigger it will hurt.

18
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,388
Don't release the video.

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,141
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

20
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,894
Because tonight, George will die.

21
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,354
Basil, your… your wife
wants to talk to you.

22
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,814
PREVIOUSLY

23
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,734
Sam, can you watch our drinks?

24
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,194
I need to take this call.

25
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,237
- Sure.
- Thank you.

26
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:20,538
Love…

27
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,708
whatever you want to say,

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,418
just say it.

29
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,713
No matter how bad it is,

30
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,715
I promise I will listen.

31
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:35,929
Maybe now is not the right time.

32
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,976
Let's just say that honesty

33
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,895
is your gift for my birthday.

34
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:46,981
Answer my question first.

35
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:52,862
Are you in a relationship with Sam?

36
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,308
What makes you think that?

37
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:25,854
So you're not?

38
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,565
Love,

39
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,483
Sam is not my type.

40
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,202
Basil, I can't get pregnant.

41
00:02:45,832 --> 00:02:46,916
What's wrong?

42
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,461
- What's wrong? What's happened?
- Mother, my tummy hurts.

43
00:02:50,545 --> 00:02:51,963
Come here.

44
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,923
Hold on. Let's go.

45
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:58,636
My obstetrician says that
it's a hopeless case,

46
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,181
and the only time I can get pregnant

47
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,101
is if the Angel Gabriel appears before me

48
00:03:05,184 --> 00:03:08,271
and performs an immaculate conception.

49
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,570
Don't cry, okay?

50
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,907
It's okay.

51
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,910
Nothing changes.

52
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:22,911
All right?

53
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,497
My love for you will never change.

54
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,627
If we can't have children,

55
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:32,086
so be it.

56
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:33,755
All right?

57
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,257
It will just be you and me

58
00:03:37,091 --> 00:03:38,551
from this day

59
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,679
until the end of our days.

60
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,238
Sam!

61
00:03:58,321 --> 00:03:59,906
Hold on.

62
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,158
Wait, be careful.

63
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,160
Come on, let's go inside.

64
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:06,371
Let's go inside.

65
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,540
Sam, let's go inside.

66
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,475
Are you okay?

67
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,978
I'm okay. My tummy suddenly hurt.

68
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,564
I'm okay now, Mother.
Please look for Francis.

69
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,025
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

70
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,404
I'm okay.

71
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,738
- All right.
- I'm all right, Mother.

72
00:04:55,169 --> 00:04:58,548
You help someone who's drunk,
you don't laugh at them!

73
00:04:58,631 --> 00:04:59,716
Give me that.

74
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,718
Oh my gosh, what the heck?

75
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,596
I already deleted the videos.

76
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,682
They might have uploaded them
and they might have gone viral.

77
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:08,850
That would have been so humiliating.

78
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:12,895
Sisterhood should be about protecting
each other, not destroying one another.

79
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,813
Georgina.

80
00:05:16,065 --> 00:05:17,358
It's okay.

81
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:19,319
Sam.

82
00:05:30,371 --> 00:05:31,914
Sorry, my child.

83
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,084
Sorry.

84
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:15,958
Mother?

85
00:06:17,085 --> 00:06:18,544
Where is Francis?

86
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,630
We need to leave.

87
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,383
We need to leave, Mother.

88
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,927
- We need to go.
- Why?

89
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,178
Trust me.

90
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,555
Just help look for Francis, please.

91
00:06:42,318 --> 00:06:44,237
Answer the phone.

92
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:51,035
This is mine?

93
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,165
I think this is mine.

94
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:03,965
Basil!

95
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,278
I want you to say something.
Wrap it up.

96
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,696
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Okay?

97
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:27,905
Okay.

98
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,497
So, how did it go?

99
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,040
You're right.

100
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,834
Basil loves me.

101
00:07:40,334 --> 00:07:41,461
Told you.

102
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,685
Excuse me.

103
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,270
Oh, is that your bag?

104
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:00,646
Yes.

105
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,356
Excuse us.

106
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,218
Where is it?

107
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,637
Sam, your brother is not answering.

108
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,680
What are you looking for?

109
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,807
Sam…

110
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:39,852
Hello, everyone. Hi.

111
00:08:40,394 --> 00:08:43,314
Can you grab the drinks
that are in front of you?

112
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,734
To all my friends and family,

113
00:08:46,817 --> 00:08:50,446
and everyone that had the honor
to be invited here,

114
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,781
you're welcome.

115
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:57,662
In all seriousness, raise your glass.

116
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,874
To an extravagant year

117
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,502
and a fabulous future ahead of us.

118
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,296
Happy birthday to me.

119
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:09,549
Happy birthday!

120
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,302
Mother we need to leave.

121
00:09:13,928 --> 00:09:14,804
Why?

122
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,014
What's happening?

123
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,205
- What the hell is this?
- Oh my God.

124
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:42,790
- What was that?
- What happened to the lights?

125
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,126
Please turn on the lights.

126
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:47,878
- What was that?
- What happened there?

127
00:09:47,962 --> 00:09:50,339
- Oh no!
- Oh my God.

128
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,092
What's happening?

129
00:09:53,968 --> 00:09:55,177
What is it?

130
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,309
- What was that?
- What happened there?

131
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:03,019
- What was that?
- What happened to the lights?

132
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,770
Please turn on the lights.

133
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:08,107
- What is it?
- What's happening?

134
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,234
- Oh no.
- Oh my God.

135
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,902
Basil?

136
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:13,404
Galvan!

137
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:17,658
Basil!

138
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,704
Death card.

139
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:22,997
It's another death.

140
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,957
Someone else will die.

141
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,208
Basil?

142
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:27,877
Basil?

143
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:47,730
Please stop!

144
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,151
I don't want to anymore.

145
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,361
Rebecca?

146
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:59,158
No! Quiet, quiet.

147
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,410
Ma'am Rebecca?

148
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:08,000
No! No… don't.

149
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:11,045
- I've committed a sin.
- No, you didn't.

150
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:13,339
- I have sinned.
- Stop crying.

151
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,007
- No, I have sinned.
- Stop crying

152
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:18,094
- I committed a sin.
- You didn't. Stop crying.

153
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,221
- I committed a sin.
- Stop crying. Let's go back to the party.

154
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:25,017
No! I have sinned.

155
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:26,519
No, no, no. Let's go.

156
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:31,607
- It's too noisy.
- It's okay. It's nothing.

157
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,736
- No, I've committed a sin!
- That's enough now.

158
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,530
Let's go back to the party.

159
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,365
- I didn't sin?
- You didn't.

160
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:41,450
Let's go.

161
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,713
Basil!

162
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,174
- Basil!
- Basil!

163
00:11:57,842 --> 00:11:59,718
- Basil! Hey!
- Oh my God.

164
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,845
- Basil!
- What's wrong with you?

165
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,847
- Basil? Basil!
- Basil!

166
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,598
- Basil! Basil!
- George!

167
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,933
- Basil!
- Basil!

168
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,070
George!

169
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,655
Your husband!

170
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:26,704
- George!
- Basil!

171
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,556
Pa, he's having an allergic reaction.

172
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,100
Is there a doctor here?

173
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:50,144
Is there a doctor?

174
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,396
- Basil!
- Basil!

175
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,481
Basil!

176
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:54,773
What are we going to do?

177
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,110
- Oh my God!
- What are we going to do?

178
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,321
Auntie Aurora, remember the cards?

179
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:05,534
What the card said came true, Auntie.

180
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,746
- Please come with me.
- No! No!

181
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:09,997
Basil! Love!

182
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,209
Love, stay with me.
Stay with me. Stay with me.

183
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:15,836
Shut up! I said Shut up!

184
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:17,463
Amando!

185
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,299
- Call an ambulance.
- Call an ambulance!

186
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:21,759
Is there a doctor here?

187
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:23,719
- Let's rush him to the hospital!
- Peter!

188
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,012
Get the car!

189
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:27,139
- Let's take him to the hospital!
- You! You!

190
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:28,724
- Do you hear me?
- Stop it!

191
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:30,017
- Stop it!
- Is there a doctor here?

192
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,144
What's that? What are you going
to do with that?

193
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:34,271
Will you post that on social media?

194
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:38,484
How did your mother raise you?
You're just like Vivian!

195
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:41,278
And you too, Beatrice!

196
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,656
Stop drinking!

197
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,076
Can't you see that Basil's unconscious?!

198
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:48,202
Your ex!

199
00:13:48,285 --> 00:13:50,287
That's why I'm drinking, Auntie.

200
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:52,289
Stop that!

201
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,836
Everybody, go home!

202
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,673
This party is over!

203
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,054
What are you looking for?

204
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,264
Wait.

205
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,640
Sam?

206
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:16,981
Sam!

207
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:22,194
Dear? Sam, what's wrong?

208
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,613
- Help!
- What's happened to you?

209
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:26,907
- Come here.
- Sam?

210
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:31,036
- Sam?
- Are you okay? What happened?

211
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,454
Sam?

212
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,539
Sam!

213
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:35,958
Are you okay?

214
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:39,670
Sam! Sam, what happened?
How's my grandchild?

215
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,714
- Oh my God.
- What's happening?

216
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,632
- Amando, go get the car!
- Careful, careful

217
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:46,468
- Let's go to the hospital!
- Let's go!

218
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:20,878
Let's go.

219
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,088
- Come on.
- Wait, stay here.

220
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,423
- What?
- You don't need to come.

221
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,675
- It's crowded already.
- What?

222
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,844
All right. Take care of your sister, okay?

223
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,848
Update me, okay?

224
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:37,353
Son!

225
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,241
- Hurry! Bring him in!
- Lance!

226
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,785
- Lance!
- Yes, sir?

227
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,787
- Do everything for my son.
- We will do everything, sir.

228
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,288
- We will do everything.
- Please!

229
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,539
Hurry up! Hurry up!

230
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,916
Epi, 0.5.

231
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,334
- Yes, Doc.
- Hydrocort, 250.

232
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,752
- Make sure of it.
- Do everything!

233
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,170
Yes, Doc.

234
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,464
Please ready the Epi, please.

235
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:09,093
Thank you. Hydrocort, diphen, 50 now.

236
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,512
- IV line ready.
- His airways are closing! Do something!

237
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,347
We are doing everything we can,
Mrs. Palacios.

238
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:14,556
Basil, please.

239
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,309
Please, hurry up!
Why are you so slow?

240
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,145
Please allow us to do our work,
Mrs. Palacios.

241
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:22,147
Ward, what's with you?
I'm a nurse! I know what to do!

242
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,315
Don't meddle with them.

243
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,651
- Just let them do their job.
- Basil, please.

244
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:27,444
Thank you. Starting.

245
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,780
Asystole. Continue CPR.

246
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:32,366
Please, Basil.
Please, please, please, Basil.

247
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:33,826
Please, wake up. Wake up.

248
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:35,285
Wake up, Basil, please.

249
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,122
Please. Please.

250
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,261
Sam.

251
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,721
Come on.

252
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:57,349
Are you okay?

253
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,351
Amando, take care of her.

254
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,771
Where is your OB-GYN?

255
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,815
Who's on duty?

256
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,400
Jane? Good, you're here.

257
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,651
- Come here.
- Why, ma'am?

258
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,571
My daughter-in-law,
her tummy is aching and she's pregnant.

259
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,531
Something might happen to my grandchild.

260
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,908
- Nurse.
- Ma, go to Uncle Galvan.

261
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,326
- I'm okay now.
- But are you sure?

262
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:19,413
- Yes. Yes, I can handle this.
- Please take care of her, Jane.

263
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,247
Yes, ma'am.

264
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:24,043
- I'll do a quick check.
- Okay, let's go.

265
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:29,298
- Start Ambu bagging! Now!
- We are, Mrs. Palacios.

266
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:31,842
Nurse, please assist Mrs. Palacios out.

267
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:32,926
No, please! No.

268
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,595
No! Let go of me, Ward.

269
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:35,721
- Let go of me.
- George.

270
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,014
Basil!

271
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,849
Hurry. Hurry, please.

272
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:40,726
Ward! Wait, Ward.

273
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:42,686
- Ward, let go of me!
- What's happening inside?

274
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,188
My husband needs me!

275
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,606
- Basil, please.
- Calm down. It's okay.

276
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:49,693
- Galvan.
- Ambu bag, thank you.

277
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:51,278
Basil can't die.

278
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,863
Basil can't die!

279
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,365
Galvan, stop it.

280
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,785
Basil will survive this, okay?

281
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:59,536
My son can't die.

282
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:02,247
He can't die!

283
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,001
The baby is okay.

284
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,003
But, Mrs. Palacios,

285
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:10,214
you should avoid stress.

286
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,883
You need to rest.

287
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,096
Doc, are we okay now?

288
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:18,388
I'll just go to them.

289
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:19,848
- Okay.
- Thank you.

290
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,559
Rhythm check. Go.

291
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,981
Please! Basil, please! Please!
Do something.

292
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:29,358
Hurry up.

293
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,902
- Basil…
- Continue CPR. Thank you.

294
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,362
Basil.

295
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:35,781
Please, wake up. Wake up!

296
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,199
Let's do a rhythm check.

297
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,784
Please, please, Basil, please!

298
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,536
Please, wake up.

299
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,037
Please.

300
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,747
Last Epi given, please.

301
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:44,581
Love!

302
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,376
- Basil, wake up, please!
- Continue CPR.

303
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:49,044
- Please. Please.
- Last round.

304
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:04,268
I'm sorry, Mrs. Palacios.

305
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,311
Time of death, 9:35 p.m.

306
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,908
No! Revive my husband!

307
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:23,078
No! If you don't want to revive him,
I will do it.

308
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,580
- Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
- Love! Basil!

309
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:25,956
- Basil, please wake up.
- Ma'am, please calm down.

310
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:27,666
- Basil, please!
- Ma'am!

311
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:31,461
- Basil, wake up. Wake up!
- Ma'am, that's enough.

312
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,631
No, let me go!

313
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,091
Basil!

314
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,428
- My husband needs me!
- Let's go.

315
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:43,473
Let go of me, Ward!
Let go of me!

316
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,100
Basil!

317
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,728
Let go!

318
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,564
Lance.

319
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:51,815
Basil…

320
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,817
What's happening? What's happening?!

321
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:56,528
I'm sorry, Mr. Galvan,
we have done everything.

322
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,363
Basil didn't make it.

323
00:19:58,739 --> 00:19:59,990
What?!

324
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,241
No!

325
00:20:01,325 --> 00:20:03,202
No! He can't die!

326
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,287
Basil can't die!

327
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,956
No! No!

328
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,626
No!

329
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:12,794
- No!
- Galvan, calm down.

330
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:14,588
- No!
- Calm down, Galvan.

331
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,298
How can I calm down?!

332
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,431
My son is too young to die.

333
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:28,060
He still has a lot of things to do.

334
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,188
He still needs to manage Palacios Mining.

335
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:33,941
He was going to be the next CEO!

336
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:34,900
How can I calm down?!

337
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,154
Lance!

338
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,950
Go back inside!
Bring my son back to life!

339
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,618
Bring him back to life!

340
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,870
Bring him back!

341
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:49,581
That's enough, Galvan! Stop it!

342
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:52,793
He's a doctor! He is not God!

343
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,587
He can't bring your son back to life!

344
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:56,588
Shut up!

345
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,674
Shut up!

346
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,218
George!

347
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:03,011
This is your fault!

348
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,264
You neglected my son.

349
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,932
You knew he had allergies.

350
00:21:07,015 --> 00:21:09,935
You're a nurse, but you neglected him!

351
00:21:10,018 --> 00:21:12,771
Pa, I monitor everything.

352
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,648
His food, all his drinks,

353
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:17,359
and especially the medicines he drinks.

354
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,027
Then why this?

355
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,028
Doc, please.

356
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:23,240
I need to know how my husband died.

357
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:26,034
The most we can do is an autopsy.

358
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,452
Do lab test, blood test…

359
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,662
That's the most we can do.

360
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:30,414
Do it now, Lance.

361
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:31,581
And be on top of it,

362
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:35,627
or else the Palacios
will stop financing this hospital.

363
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:37,421
Understood.

364
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:42,551
Galvan.

365
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,013
- Galvan…
- No!

366
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,307
- Galvan.
- You can't die, my son!

367
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,809
- Galvan, that's enough!
- Basil can't die!

368
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,813
He can't die!

369
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,653
He can't die!

370
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,449
He can't die!

371
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:25,635
Sam?

372
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,458
Hey, look.

373
00:22:57,084 --> 00:23:00,003
They were also like that
when Sir Paco died.

374
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,255
The crows are flying around.

375
00:23:03,173 --> 00:23:05,967
I think those are
the Grim Reaper's minions.

376
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,346
Sir Paco only just died
and there's already another death?

377
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,764
Oh no.

378
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:12,891
I think there's something wrong
with this house.

379
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,559
Oh my. It's scary.

380
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:15,936
You are overthinking things.

381
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:16,937
Chill!

382
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:19,397
Come on, let's go in.

383
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:23,693
Bro…

384
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:29,157
Sir Basil just had an allergic reaction
but he's died already?

385
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,245
Give me that.

386
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,454
Why? Is it yours?

387
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,414
It's mine. I left it here.

388
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:39,709
What are you doing? That's my cell phone.

389
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,044
Why won't you give it to me?

390
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,296
What are you doing here?

391
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,092
I was looking for your sister.

392
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:48,593
To comfort her.

393
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,764
And then I saw a phone on the floor.
That's why I picked it up.

394
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,182
It was your phone.

395
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,697
Where's the cell phone?

396
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,073
Where's the cell phone?

397
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:11,950
Where's your cell phone?

398
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,202
Oh my God.

399
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:16,413
Oh my God.

400
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,085
Ma'am Rebecca?

401
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,755
Ma'am Rebecca!

402
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,385
Ma'am Rebecca!

403
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,198
Ma'am Rebecca?

404
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,292
I think…

405
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:46,044
I think I did something.

406
00:25:47,545 --> 00:25:49,464
I think I did something wrong.

407
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,802
I have a feeling I did something, but…

408
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,806
I just can't remember it.

409
00:25:58,431 --> 00:25:59,474
I don't know…

410
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:01,559
There.

411
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,062
Look.

412
00:26:07,357 --> 00:26:08,817
That's someone, right?

413
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:16,491
And then there's a wine glass.

414
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,911
Isn't that Basil?

415
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,835
Jerico…

416
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:30,672
do you think

417
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:35,010
I did that to Basil?

418
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,511
No, ma'am.

419
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:39,889
You didn't do anything wrong.

420
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,728
It wasn't you who poisoned Sir Basil.

421
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:50,942
It wasn't you.

422
00:26:56,823 --> 00:26:59,576
Why is it like this?

423
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,581
A lot of things are happening.

424
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:09,627
A lot of things are happening.

425
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,050
Why?

426
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,489
What?

427
00:27:37,572 --> 00:27:39,491
Basil is already dead?

428
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:41,368
Basil is already dead?

429
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,455
What will happen to us now?

430
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,419
What will happen to us?

431
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:56,049
Francis, don't laugh at someone
who's just lost a loved one.

432
00:27:57,842 --> 00:27:59,969
Could this place be cursed?

433
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,847
Our bosses are dying one by one.

434
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:07,477
Are they dying, or are they being killed?

435
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,240
How could you do this to me, love?

436
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:27,122
You said we'd grow old together.

437
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,376
George, faster.

438
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:34,379
We can't be late
to our own company's Halloween party.

439
00:28:34,462 --> 00:28:36,339
Yes, coming.

440
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,591
So, do we pass as an old couple?

441
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:41,636
Yes, we slay as an old couple.

442
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:43,555
Love?

443
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,599
Will you still love me
when I look this way?

444
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,685
I don't know.

445
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,230
For one, I won't have wrinkles like this
when I get older.

446
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,983
What's with you, love?

447
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,277
50, 60, 70 years from now,

448
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,404
when we both look like this,

449
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,573
we'll still be together, right?

450
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:03,700
Of course. Of course.

451
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,160
Promise?

452
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:06,286
Promise.

453
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:12,250
That's why you should get pregnant
so we can have a baby.

454
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,960
You know what they say,

455
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,671
and I really do believe this.

456
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,299
Children hold the marriage together.

457
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,718
- So hurry up.
- Okay.

458
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,219
Hurry up. We gotta go to it.

459
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,305
- We're gonna pass as an old couple.
- We should walk slowly like this.

460
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:26,222
Let's go.

461
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,684
Let's go.

462
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,854
I'm so sorry, love.

463
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,609
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to give you a baby.

464
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:43,531
But you still promised me
the rest of your life.

465
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,371
How I wish you'd fulfilled
even just half of it.

466
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:36,084
Excuse me.

467
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,712
I am Basil Palacios' cousin-in-law.

468
00:30:39,796 --> 00:30:43,341
I'd like to get his things
so I can give them to his wife.

469
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:47,554
Ma'am, we didn't get any items from
Sir Basil when he was brought here.

470
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,516
Thank you.

471
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:36,978
George?

472
00:31:40,189 --> 00:31:41,900
What are you doing here?

473
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,613
Are you here to watch me grieve?

474
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,575
Are you amused by what you're seeing?

475
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:54,203
George, why would I be happy?

476
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,540
I also lost a husband.

477
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,001
Exactly.

478
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,130
So you want me to lose a husband too.
Is that it?

479
00:32:09,093 --> 00:32:11,095
Maybe you prayed for this.

480
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:14,307
George, why would I pray for this?

481
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:17,060
Because you don't want me to be happy!

482
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,396
You want to be like you.

483
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,690
No husband.

484
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:24,943
All alone.

485
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,528
A widow!

486
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,099
What are you looking at?

487
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:02,146
Mother?

488
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:07,276
Ruth?

489
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:09,737
How are you doing?

490
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,781
Have you talked to George yet?

491
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,033
Please, Mercy.

492
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:16,536
Get real!

493
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,914
I know you're enjoying yourself

494
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:23,376
because my daughter has lost her husband.

495
00:33:23,459 --> 00:33:24,585
No.

496
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:29,340
I know the feeling of a mother
whose daughter is grieving.

497
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,718
So what, we're twinning, is that it?

498
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:34,721
Come on, Mercy, just stop it.

499
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:40,018
I know you're happy
because my daughter is already a widow.

500
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:42,687
Why are you thinking that way?

501
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:47,108
Maybe it's because you were like that
when Sam became a widow.

502
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:49,068
Did you enjoy that?

503
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:51,654
You know, you're such a bad person.

504
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:53,239
- Well, you're such a slut!
- Oh, you!

505
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,323
Mother, that's enough.

506
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,034
It's Ruth's fault.

507
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:58,119
I was just concerned about her
and her daughter,

508
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,246
and she suddenly started accusing me!

509
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:04,709
Hey, Mercy, I don't need any concern
from anyone in your family!

510
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:06,669
- Especially not from you!
- That's enough. Stop it.

511
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,504
What? You're angry?

512
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:11,174
You're stupid, you know.

513
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,135
You came here to taunt me.

514
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:18,139
- George, I came here to comfort you.
- No, Sam.

515
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:22,185
You came here
because you're looking for a fight.

516
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:25,104
So come on! Let's fight! I don't care!

517
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:27,231
George, I know what you're
going through is painful

518
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,775
because you've lost your husband.

519
00:34:28,858 --> 00:34:32,403
But if you're looking for a fight
to vent your grief, George,

520
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:34,322
don't involve me, please.

521
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,449
- Don't turn your back on me.
- George, please. Please.

522
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:39,368
- I said don't turn your back on me.
- Let go of me!

523
00:34:44,207 --> 00:34:47,585
Maybe you're right.
This is my way of grieving!

524
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,254
I'm looking for someone to hurt.

525
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,422
- So, come on.
- Ouch.

526
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:52,757
- Let's slap each other.
- George.

527
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:55,134
- Let's slap each other here.
- George, I'm hurting, please.

528
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,594
- That's enough.
- Let's slap each other!

529
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:58,679
- Let's pull each other's hair!
- Stop it!

530
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:01,724
- Stop it! What the heck?!
- Come on, fight back!

531
00:35:03,392 --> 00:35:05,228
I will not fight with you.

532
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,440
Go back to your husband.

533
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,735
Cry for him.

534
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:15,905
Embrace him.

535
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:19,867
This is the last time
you'll be able to do that.

536
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,321
George,

537
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,450
the results of Basil's lab test
are out already.

538
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:24,223
- You're too much!
- Mother, that's enough!

539
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:25,892
- You're the one who's too much!
- Ms. Ruth, that's enough!

540
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:27,185
- Come here, oh gosh!
- Mother!

541
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,436
Ma'am, stop it.

542
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,438
No matter what happens,
you always blame us!

543
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,564
Why are you meddling?

544
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:33,482
- You're too much!
- You!

545
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:37,737
I don't need any concern coming from
your family, Mercy!

546
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:41,199
I don't need it, especially not from you!

547
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:44,076
Damn you!

548
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,078
- You're too much!
- My goodness!

549
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:46,954
You're worse!

550
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,456
Stop bothering me!

551
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:50,208
You're too much!

552
00:36:54,962 --> 00:36:55,755
Mother…

553
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:57,757
That woman is annoying.

554
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:00,927
All of you…

555
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,721
One day you'll get what you deserve!

556
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,973
One day you will too!

557
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,359
Why did you follow me here?

558
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,736
You have no business being here!

559
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:21,197
Hey, George!

560
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,787
Sam is a Palacios. She's family.

561
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,373
There's nothing wrong with her being here.

562
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,503
Are you okay, Sam?

563
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,921
How's my grandchild?

564
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,632
- Okay, come on sit down.
- Okay.

565
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:42,009
- Have a seat.
- I'm okay.

566
00:37:42,093 --> 00:37:43,594
It's normal.

567
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,804
It was just fatigue.

568
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:45,972
That's great.

569
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,306
Come on, sit down.

570
00:37:56,607 --> 00:38:00,111
Doc, what were the results
of Basil's lab test?

571
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:02,321
What really killed my husband?

572
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:20,464
These are the initial results
although not yet conclusive.

573
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,175
We still need to do the autopsy first

574
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,593
to further confirm.

575
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,137
Just tell us.

576
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:29,098
Okay.

577
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:33,019
We found massive amounts
of morphine in Basil's system.

578
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,021
What?

579
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,314
Morphine?

580
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:41,068
Massive amounts of morphine
indicating foul play.

581
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:44,530
There's no amount that would indicate
that this is not accidental.

582
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,159
This was deliberate.

583
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,953
Someone did this to my husband.

584
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:54,915
Basil is allergic to morphine.

585
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:57,126
He wouldn't just take it on purpose.

586
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:02,048
Someone poisoned my husband.

587
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:05,092
- Who did this to him?!
- George, calm down.

588
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:07,720
I'll have this investigated!

589
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:10,806
We need to know who did this to Basil!

590
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,893
The person who poisoned
my husband will pay!

591
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,899
I will look for the person
who poisoned you.

592
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,777
I promise.

593
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:15,913
Pa…

594
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,421
I can't, George.

595
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:27,550
I don't want to see him.

596
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,927
I don't want to accept that he's gone.

597
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,389
I can't, George.

598
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,558
I can't do it.

599
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,351
I can't do it.

600
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,234
Pa, I know it's difficult.

601
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,236
Look at me, please.

602
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,992
But you can do it.

603
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,287
I'll go with you.

604
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,712
Basil, son, I know you're in pain,

605
00:41:46,795 --> 00:41:49,381
but the doctor's coming
with the medicine, okay?

606
00:41:49,465 --> 00:41:52,009
He's going to give you
the medicine, all right?

607
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,135
Okay?

608
00:42:07,107 --> 00:42:08,442
Doc, what's happening?

609
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,402
What's taking you so long?

610
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:13,822
My son is in pain.
Why don't you give him a painkiller?

611
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,909
I'm sorry, Mr. Palacios,

612
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:23,415
but Basil's intradermal test result showed
that he is allergic to painkillers.

613
00:42:23,499 --> 00:42:26,752
We have alternative methods
that we are considering.

614
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:29,463
All right. Whatever it is,
just give it to him.

615
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,424
- He's in pain. Hurry up, please.
- Okay, we will, we will.

616
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,308
Son, the doctor's coming back, okay?

617
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,061
He's going to give you the medicine, okay?

618
00:42:44,144 --> 00:42:46,522
It's okay, Pa.

619
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:48,232
I can take pain.

620
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:52,194
And I'm a strong and brave boy.

621
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,779
I know you're…

622
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,739
I know you're a brave boy.

623
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,157
I know you're strong.

624
00:42:57,241 --> 00:42:58,659
All right?

625
00:42:58,742 --> 00:42:59,910
Okay, Basil?

626
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:02,663
Okay? You just hang on, okay?

627
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:04,039
- Okay.
- All right.

628
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:11,297
You grew up to be a strong and brave man
that you are, son.

629
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,633
Please…

630
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:15,843
Who…

631
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:17,928
who…

632
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,599
who did this to you?!

633
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,226
Who?

634
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:27,062
Who poisoned him?

635
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,147
Who?

636
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,449
Sam, why are you hurrying?

637
00:43:38,532 --> 00:43:39,533
Be careful.

638
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,951
You're carrying my grandchild.

639
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,287
That child is the future
of Palacios Mining.

640
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,788
That child will succeed me.

641
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:45,956
Really, Aurora?

642
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,583
My son, Basil, just died,

643
00:43:47,666 --> 00:43:49,543
and you're still thinking about
the company?

644
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:50,878
"If you outlive me."

645
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:53,255
That's the last thing you told Basil.

646
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:57,051
You didn't want my son to outlive you.
It's you who poisoned him.

647
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,510
<i>Is what Mother and I heard true?</i>

648
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,304
It was morphine that poisoned Basil?

649
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:01,930
Morphine, just like my medicine?

650
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:07,227
Could it be that George has known for
a long time that Basil had a mistress,

651
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,689
and that's the reason why
she killed her husband?

652
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:17,780
George is a bitter, vengeful wife
who killed her own husband.

653
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:19,406
I need your help.

654
