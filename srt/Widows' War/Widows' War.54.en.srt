1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,349
Edward Balay has proven his innocence.

2
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:18,518
So, he really was framed?

3
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,061
- Yes.
- Damn it.

4
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,897
The investigation will focus on me again.

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,024
I don't think so, madam.

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:27,610
They don't have
strong evidence against you.

7
00:00:27,694 --> 00:00:29,487
Let's sue them.

8
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,948
Mom, we won't sue Sam anymore.

9
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,408
And why not?

10
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:36,036
She doesn't matter to me anymore, Mom.

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,914
I'd rather focus
on finding the monster who framed Ward

12
00:00:39,998 --> 00:00:41,791
than waste my time

13
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,294
on the person I want to curse.

14
00:00:45,336 --> 00:00:46,713
- Don't.
- Mom, I'm not doing anything.

15
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,381
What do you mean
you're not doing anything?

16
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:51,092
The next time you go near my daughter,

17
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,094
you won't only get that.

18
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,929
Don't tell George about this.

19
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,139
Do you understand?

20
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:59,100
PREVIOUSLY

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,978
Ward, what happened to you?

22
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:03,063
- Did someone hurt you?
- Sam, don't…

23
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:04,397
Sam, don't.

24
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,482
Ward, wait.

25
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,775
Ward, what happened to you?

26
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,611
- Ward, stand up. Come here…
- Why are you hurting my brother?

27
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,286
I said get out of my room.

28
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:20,288
Get out! Get out.

29
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,041
I said get out.

30
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,459
Get out, Amando. Get out.

31
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:26,836
Answer my question first.

32
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,131
Aurora…

33
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,595
Is Rebecca your daughter with Orly?

34
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:39,182
You're so evil, Samantha.

35
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,518
George, Ward is lying.

36
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,727
I didn't do that.

37
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:44,646
Is that all you're going to say?

38
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,397
That my brother is lying?

39
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,243
Get the hell out of my room.

40
00:01:58,326 --> 00:01:59,369
Get the hell out.

41
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,621
Get the hell out here.

42
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:04,999
Get out of my room. Get out…

43
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:07,460
Guards! Guards!

44
00:02:08,837 --> 00:02:10,338
Ma'am, sir…

45
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:11,339
Sir, that's enough.

46
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,049
Get out of my room.

47
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,717
Take that man out of here.

48
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,886
Sir, come with us.

49
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,930
Keep him away from me.

50
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,016
- Get out of here.
- George, wait.

51
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,518
- Get out. Get out of here.
- George.

52
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:26,354
From now on, don't you ever come near me

53
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,356
or my mom, and especially not Ward.

54
00:02:34,904 --> 00:02:36,239
Get out.

55
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,780
Ward?

56
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:23,995
Ward?

57
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:31,544
Ward?

58
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,636
Sir Amando, that's enough.

59
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,304
Let go of me, Cairo.

60
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:42,805
Sir, that's enough. Rico.

61
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,265
Don't meddle with me.

62
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,184
- Sir… Rico.
- I said… what's with you?

63
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,268
- Sir, that's enough.
- What?

64
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:48,269
I said that's enough.

65
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:49,729
Sir, stop it.

66
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:50,813
I said let go of me.

67
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:51,814
Let go.

68
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,777
What happened here?

69
00:03:57,153 --> 00:03:57,987
You too.

70
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,324
Just let me be.

71
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:02,408
What?

72
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,493
Go ahead.

73
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,537
Sir Amando…

74
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:08,289
I will kill you one by one.

75
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:12,085
Mom…

76
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,420
Ward is not in your room.

77
00:04:15,004 --> 00:04:16,547
He's not here in the den either.

78
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,591
Where did that kid go?

79
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,814
Mom…

80
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:35,108
Mom… George…

81
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:36,901
- Ward.
- Mom.

82
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:37,986
Mom. Mom.

83
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,321
Ward… Ward…

84
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:48,621
- You.
- Sir…

85
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,373
I said let go of me.

86
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:51,291
- What?
- Sir, that's enough.

87
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,835
- And all of you.
- Give me that, Sir Amando.

88
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:57,630
Sir, that's enough.

89
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,590
Sir, that's enough. Sit down.

90
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,759
- Sit down.
- Let me go.

91
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,011
Let me go.

92
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:05,930
Ward…

93
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,018
Why are you hiding in the cabinet?

94
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,103
I'm scared.

95
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:14,230
They might hurt me.

96
00:05:15,857 --> 00:05:17,150
Look.

97
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,777
Look at what Sam did to your brother.

98
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,614
Ward…

99
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,992
there's no reason for you to be scared.

100
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:28,578
Mom is here. I am here.

101
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:29,912
No one can hurt you.

102
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,248
We will protect you. Do you understand?

103
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,543
Do you want me

104
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:38,004
to sleep with you later?

105
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:40,214
Do you want that?

106
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,596
She's such a fool.

107
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:51,726
She's so arrogant.

108
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:55,021
She thinks so highly of herself.

109
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,151
She…

110
00:06:00,234 --> 00:06:01,819
treats me

111
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,490
as if I am not human.

112
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:09,952
She's an animal.

113
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:12,789
Animal…

114
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,707
Animal.

115
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:28,930
Mom…

116
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:34,519
I don't want to stay here anymore.

117
00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,899
They're not only killing the Palacioses,

118
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,235
but everyone else.

119
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,240
Look at what they did to Francis.

120
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:53,121
If they don't kill you, they frame you.

121
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,207
Just like they did to me, Mom.

122
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,126
I almost died from fear.

123
00:06:58,209 --> 00:07:00,711
I don't know what to do anymore.

124
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,551
At a young age,

125
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,887
I was already at her beck and call.

126
00:07:14,142 --> 00:07:15,935
All my life,

127
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,731
I've been serving her.

128
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,653
And now… she will just fool me!

129
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,322
Sir Amando.

130
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,366
Rico, get the first aid kit. Hurry.

131
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,746
She only fooled me…

132
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,248
She only fooled me.

133
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,295
Do you know that?

134
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,673
She just fooled me.

135
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:47,633
Sir Amando…

136
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,769
George, I think it's better
if we leave this place,

137
00:07:58,853 --> 00:08:00,313
so we won't get in trouble,

138
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,772
especially your baby.

139
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,632
Sir Amando, I'm almost finished here.

140
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,515
Sir…

141
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,642
- Sir Amando…
- Jericho…

142
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,393
Let him be.

143
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:41,312
Just let him.

144
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,607
Ward…

145
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:48,236
I'm sorry but we can't leave yet.

146
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,197
Until I haven't found out who framed you,

147
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,865
we have to stay here.

148
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,995
George, it's no longer important
who did this to me.

149
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:02,083
What's important is,
that no one gets hurt among us.

150
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,714
I thought Sir Amando loved the Palacioses,

151
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:09,715
especially Madam?

152
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,092
What happened?

153
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,470
That's what's bothering me.

154
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,515
That's the first time
I've seen him that mad.

155
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,225
The truth is,

156
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,894
this is the first time
I've him with emotions.

157
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,316
At least, now we know he is human
and not a robot.

158
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,487
But, they're dangerous,

159
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:32,655
people who don't talk.

160
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,618
They are like volcanoes
when they explode, it can kill.

161
00:10:08,524 --> 00:10:09,567
Amando…

162
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,986
What the hell are you doing, Amando?

163
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,697
Stop it. What's with you, Amando?

164
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,118
Stop it, Amando. Stop.

165
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,206
Hey, stop that.

166
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,250
Don't gossip about him.

167
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:28,961
Take care of things here.

168
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:30,004
Clear the things here.

169
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:37,178
Yes, sir.

170
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:39,847
The boss is mean.

171
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:43,225
Slowly, he's becoming a Palacios.

172
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,311
No, he won't.

173
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,695
Go ahead and continue.

174
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,364
I will sue you for rape.

175
00:10:57,031 --> 00:11:00,993
And I will make sure
you rot in jail, Amando.

176
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,333
Your brother is right, George.

177
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,292
Let's just forget

178
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,711
whoever that demon is that framed him.

179
00:11:10,795 --> 00:11:13,297
God will punish them
for their evil doings.

180
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,510
But, Mom…

181
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,262
I have a strong hunch
that he has something to do

182
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,556
with poisoning Basil.

183
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,351
Maybe he was the one Iñigo
was referring to

184
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,354
as the mastermind who killed my husband.

185
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,855
That's why I won't stop

186
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:33,067
until I catch him and put him in jail.

187
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,446
Mom, I need to know who poisoned Basil.

188
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,248
God…

189
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,085
Amando.

190
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,380
What happened with us before

191
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,966
was just once,

192
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,387
and it will never happen again.

193
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,517
I just finished going around the compound.

194
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,728
I looked for a possible match

195
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,064
for the tire tread that we're looking for.

196
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,066
Okay, just update me.

197
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,610
- Good evening, Sarge.
- Good evening.

198
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,362
You're working late.

199
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,699
I just finished going around the compound.

200
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,161
Thank you, Sarge. And you won't stop

201
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:27,037
trying to find who framed Ward.

202
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,956
I have a strong hunch that this was done

203
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,917
by the mastermind of the Palacios killer.

204
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,713
That's why I won't stop looking.

205
00:12:36,755 --> 00:12:39,383
If you want to find out
who the mastermind is,

206
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,969
I think you need to assign
a surveillance team

207
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:44,430
for Mom Aurora and Uncle Galvan.

208
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,265
I think they have something to do with it.

209
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:56,484
Amando…

210
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,445
I was drunk then.

211
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:07,369
I was lonely. That's why it happened.

212
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,415
But, it will never happen again.

213
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,919
Now get that in your head.

214
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:23,886
I also thought of having
surveillance assigned to them.

215
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:26,013
But, Ms. Samantha, we can't.

216
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:28,766
We lack man power now.

217
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,857
If I didn't anger George,

218
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,568
we would be doing that right now.

219
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:44,281
We would be spying
on Uncle Galvan and Mom Aurora.

220
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,036
If only I hadn't been carried away
by my anger,

221
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,497
I wouldn't have hurt Ward.

222
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,999
Then George wouldn't have
gotten mad at me.

223
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,175
What are you waiting for?

224
00:14:03,759 --> 00:14:07,054
Leave before I call General Alejaga.

225
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,942
Aurora…

226
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,445
I love you so much.

227
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,491
I will do anything…

228
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,872
for you to love me too…

229
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,835
Even just a bit.

230
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,798
Even just for a small bit of love.

231
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:49,889
Okay, I'll go ahead.

232
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,016
- Bye.
- Thank you.

233
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,064
Sam…

234
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,652
It's better if we stay away
from the Balays.

235
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,279
Let's avoid them,

236
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:08,866
so we won't get involved
with their issues.

237
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,787
Hey…

238
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,582
Who are you talking about?

239
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:18,834
Let me guess.

240
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,628
It's George, right?

241
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:26,467
Don't be pissed off
because I have good news for you.

242
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:31,972
The Balays are planning
to leave this place.

243
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:35,309
See, I brought you good news.

244
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:43,609
Amando…

245
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:49,114
Not everyone we love can love us back.

246
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:54,745
I know because I went through that.

247
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:58,791
Even if it hurts,
I've accepted it because I need to.

248
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:06,215
Amando, I trust you with my life.

249
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:12,554
I feel safe and protected
when I'm with you.

250
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,852
But, that's it for the both of us.

251
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,522
I hope you can be content with that.

252
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,237
George. George.

253
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,613
George, wait.

254
00:16:29,697 --> 00:16:31,073
Wait, George.

255
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,619
What are you doing here?

256
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,246
Didn't I tell you

257
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,540
never to come near us?

258
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,710
Is what I heard true?

259
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,211
That you're leaving?

260
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:47,464
You're so shameless.

261
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:50,634
You really couldn't wait?

262
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,052
You even came here

263
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,763
to make sure
that we'd be out of your life.

264
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,854
George, no.

265
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:06,650
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness.

266
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:10,237
I'm sorry.

267
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,368
Amando…

268
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,416
If you want to continue working for me,

269
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,086
I don't want this to happen again.

270
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,883
Because if you do this again,

271
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,469
you're out.

272
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,430
Do you understand?

273
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,605
So, do you think your sorry

274
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,733
can erase the trauma
my brother experienced with you?

275
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,069
The pain my mother felt?

276
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,697
No, Sam.

277
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:55,491
That will never happen.

278
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,576
Now, leave.

279
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,236
Stop bothering me.

280
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,029
George… George, wait, wait.

281
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,323
Wait, let's talk first.

282
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,700
George, I'm sorry.

283
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,328
I'm sorry.

284
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:57,636
What?

285
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,681
Is that a clear answer to your sorry?

286
00:19:04,852 --> 00:19:05,769
Okay.

287
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:08,313
I deserve that.

288
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:14,903
But, don't think for a second
that you're the victim here, George.

289
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,656
We are the real victims.

290
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,659
My brother died, George.

291
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,245
And can you blame me?

292
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,165
All the pieces of evidence
are pointing at Ward.

293
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,792
You did the same thing to Francis.

294
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:30,085
You even put him in jail, remember?

295
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,004
Do you think I have forgotten
that already, George?

296
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,301
Barry.

297
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,635
Auro…

298
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:40,470
Why aren't dressed?

299
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,306
Oh, I'm sorry.

300
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,268
I fell asleep for a short while.

301
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,270
I just woke up. I'm sorry.

302
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,188
Come on, sit.

303
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:53,567
My dear, we can't miss
the ambassador's wife's event.

304
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,153
Because that's a good venue

305
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:58,197
to promote the charity event

306
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,616
for the AS3 Foundation.

307
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:03,535
And one more thing,
I'm sure you'll enjoy it

308
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,746
because Leonor will be there.

309
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,915
She's your copycat friend

310
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:10,959
who is always left behind
by her boyfriend. Just like you.

311
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,086
Orly always fools you, right?

312
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:19,134
Take back what you said.

313
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,094
That's the truth, George.

314
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,264
You're so shameless.

315
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:26,266
- Take back what you said.
- George.

316
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,560
- I said take back what you said.
- Let go of me.

317
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:30,479
- Let go of me.
- You're such a fool.

318
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:32,397
Let go of me.

319
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,361
George…

320
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,488
George…

321
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:42,115
George, are you okay?

322
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:43,784
George, are you okay?

323
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,161
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

324
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,204
Have a seat.

325
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,164
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

326
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,041
George…

327
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,794
George, are you okay?

328
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,087
Help!

329
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,257
Oh, my God… I'm sorry.

330
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,260
Barry, am I the only one?

331
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:03,595
Wasn't…

332
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,889
Wasn't your husband

333
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,102
caught with a woman in a motel?

334
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:14,648
And the husband
of his mistress attacked them,

335
00:21:15,315 --> 00:21:17,609
and killed them together?

336
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,695
Help!

337
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,572
Help!

338
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:24,783
George, George, I'm sorry.

339
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:27,077
Let go of me.

340
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:29,621
Oh, my God.

341
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,472
I'm sorry, I didn't mean it.

342
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:49,766
George, I'm sorry. Help!

343
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:50,892
My God…

344
00:21:52,644 --> 00:21:53,645
Auro, my dear…

345
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,148
My husband is faithful.

346
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,150
That was just his client.

347
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,862
But someone reported
to the husband of his client

348
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,905
that they were having an affair.

349
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,867
Sure, why not?

350
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:11,288
Your husband has been dead
for a long time.

351
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,291
I mean changing his narrative

352
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:16,960
will no longer bring him back.

353
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,670
Auro…

354
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:21,465
Can you be honest with me?

355
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:24,384
Was it you who started the rumor?

356
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,095
That's why my husband was killed?

357
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,516
- Help. Call an ambulance.
- What happened?

358
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,642
- Let's help George.
- No, no, no…

359
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,269
My God, my God…

360
00:22:34,352 --> 00:22:35,562
Hurry up. Get it.

361
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:36,480
Hurry up.

362
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,107
No, no…

363
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,150
What happened?

364
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,195
I accidentally pushed her on the stairs.

365
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,154
I didn't mean it.

366
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,656
- Mom…
- Oh, my God.

367
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,617
Mom.

368
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,327
Ma'am George. Ma'am George,
just calm down.

369
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:51,578
Calm down.

370
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,958
Why does it seem like you can't talk?

371
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,336
Guilty as charged?

372
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,464
Barry, darling…

373
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:08,011
I am not Margaret Royales-Castor.

374
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,847
I am a Palacios.

375
00:23:10,931 --> 00:23:13,975
She's high society's <i>primera chismosa.</i>

376
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:17,896
And I am the <i>primera minera.</i>

377
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,358
I am too busy mining gold

378
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,485
to get involved with…

379
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:26,029
God, petty issues like that.

380
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:28,740
I don't get involved
with the mistress issues

381
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,118
of other people.

382
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:34,996
Well, you have your own mistress issues.

383
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:38,792
You're not only mining gold
in your mines, but

384
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:43,046
in the mines of someone you love.

385
00:23:46,758 --> 00:23:48,426
What's taking Bill so long?

386
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,303
Jericho, what's happening?

387
00:23:50,387 --> 00:23:51,847
She fell off the stairs.

388
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:52,806
What?

389
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:56,101
- George…
- Mom…

390
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:57,394
George, what happened to you?

391
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,646
- Mom… Mom…
- George…

392
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,565
George, what happened?

393
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,900
George, where does it hurt?
Where does it hurt, George?

394
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,278
It's Sam.

395
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:07,863
We need to take George
to the hospital, Auntie Ruth.

396
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,114
It's Sam?

397
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,032
What did Sam do?

398
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,536
Barry…

399
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:18,373
You talk as if…

400
00:24:19,374 --> 00:24:22,669
you don't have a speck of dirt, right?

401
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,337
Oh, sure.

402
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:27,883
I dug for gold in other people's mines,

403
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:31,678
but at least I struck the real gold.

404
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:33,972
Unlike you, Barry.

405
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:39,477
You became the gold mine for some…

406
00:24:41,188 --> 00:24:45,233
tennis coach slash gold digger.

407
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,776
Oh, wait.

408
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:50,071
It happens to be your son's coach?

409
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,867
George, put me down.

410
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,869
What's with you? I said put me…

411
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,251
George.

412
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,923
No, don't move George.

413
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,633
What did you do?

414
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:12,093
Did you make an attempt
on my daughter's life?

415
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,226
What was he like?

416
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:21,645
Half your age.

417
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:23,146
A third?

418
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:30,654
Could you have
at least passed for his aunt or mommy?

419
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,531
Sugar mommy?

420
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:34,950
Don't accuse Sam.

421
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:36,117
She's innocent.

422
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,619
George fell off the stairs.

423
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,621
She fell or was she pushed?

424
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,706
What really happened, Samantha?

425
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:43,833
What's with you? Can you please be quiet?

426
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,257
Well, at least

427
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:54,427
my gold-digging boy was single.

428
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,346
I didn't steal anything from anyone.

429
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:59,641
And one more thing, he didn't leave me,

430
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,269
unlike Orly.

431
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,188
He left you, right?

432
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,148
Bitch.

433
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,317
Double bitch.

434
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,318
- Miss George, hold on.
- Hurry up. Hurry.

435
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,444
The van is here.

436
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,864
Bill, hurry. Go open the door.

437
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,825
- Okay, let's go.
- Careful. Be careful.

438
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:17,742
Bill, come here.

439
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:20,870
- Ward, get in.
- Here.

440
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,455
Assist your sister.

441
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:23,873
Go ahead first.

442
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,083
Go ahead first.

443
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,209
Help your sister.

444
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:27,711
Don't come with us.

445
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,212
- What's with you?
- Okay, come in.

446
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,799
Hurry.

447
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,220
Wow.

448
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:38,680
Catfight?

449
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:40,390
I want that.

450
00:26:40,473 --> 00:26:42,017
But, I'm sorry, Miss.

451
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,059
I'm Team Aurora.

452
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:44,853
- Go, Au.
- Oh, my God.

453
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,580
Sam, Mercy.

454
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:07,625
What's happening here?
It seems there's a commotion.

455
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:10,295
They took George to the hospital.

456
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,005
She fell from the stairs, sir.

457
00:27:12,672 --> 00:27:13,798
What?

458
00:27:22,932 --> 00:27:23,933
Hold on.

459
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,186
Why did you stop?

460
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:28,396
Go, continue.

461
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,315
Don't be ashamed with me here.

462
00:27:30,398 --> 00:27:32,400
And I won't join in.

463
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,526
I will just watch.

464
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,778
So, go.

465
00:27:35,862 --> 00:27:36,946
I'm sorry.

466
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:38,114
Who are you?

467
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:39,407
I'm--

468
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:45,372
She is Galvan's glorified caregiver.

469
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,374
Hello?

470
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,792
Excuse me.

471
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:51,169
Aurora, I'm not Galvan's caregiver.

472
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,339
And what are you, Vivian?

473
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,007
What's your relation to Galvan?

474
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:02,138
Where's Bill?

475
00:28:02,222 --> 00:28:03,890
Is Bill with them?

476
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,768
George is not careful.

477
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:09,062
George is not at fault.

478
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:11,189
Dad, just calm down.

479
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,691
Sofia, come inside with me.

480
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,110
I need to get my phone.

481
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,487
I need to talk to George.

482
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,243
Sam…

483
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:25,328
What really happened?

484
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:29,207
She is Galvan's mistress.

485
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,712
So, you're Vivian.

486
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,299
So, tell me…

487
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,512
what did Galvan like about you?

488
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:47,350
I've been asking that question
for a long time now, Barry dear.

489
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,437
Excuse me. I'm here

490
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,021
and you're talking about me.

491
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,606
And come on.

492
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,775
You were fighting earlier, right?

493
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,527
Why are you picking on me

494
00:28:57,610 --> 00:29:00,196
when you almost scratch each other?

495
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,995
I didn't mean it.

496
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,456
I came here to apologize to her.

497
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,208
And then she slapped me
and pulled my hair.

498
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,544
And then I accidentally
pushed her, Mother.

499
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,962
I didn't mean it.

500
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:17,297
- Oh, my God.
- Sam…

501
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,174
I hope nothing happens to her baby.

502
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,968
Mother, we need to go to the hospital.

503
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,636
- I need to go to the hospital.
- Sam.

504
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:24,637
Sam…

505
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:26,848
Vivian…

506
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,768
And who said we're fighting?

507
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,937
Oh, it's just one of our crazy banters.

508
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:36,691
You know, mine and Auro
love language is teasing each other.

509
00:29:36,775 --> 00:29:40,570
But, we are the best of friends.

510
00:29:40,653 --> 00:29:41,613
Right?

511
00:29:41,696 --> 00:29:43,281
Totally, Barry.

512
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,158
George, fight. Okay?

513
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,118
Mom is here.

514
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,454
I won't leave you.

515
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,626
What did Sam do to you, George?

516
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,336
She pushed me.

517
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,129
Bring her to the OB ER.

518
00:29:59,964 --> 00:30:01,090
Ma'am, sir. Just stay here.

519
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,133
We'll take care of her.

520
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:11,226
Ma'am Sam, hold on.

521
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:12,519
- Ma'am Sam, don't try. That's enough.
- I need to see George.

522
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:13,812
- Just a second.
- Stop it, Ma'am Sam.

523
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:16,815
- You fool.
- Mom. Mom. Mom.

524
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,485
What did you do to George?

525
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:22,237
Why did you push her off the stairs?

526
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,404
What do you want?

527
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,532
Do you want to kill her and my grandchild?

528
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,699
Auntie, I didn't mean it.

529
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,159
Believe me, I didn't mean it.

530
00:30:28,243 --> 00:30:29,285
You didn't mean it?

531
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,455
Just like how you didn't mean
to push Paco off the cliff?

532
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,957
You are so bad, Sam.

533
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,001
You should have done that
to me instead of George.

534
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:39,587
I didn't mean it. Please believe me.

535
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,588
She attacked me.

536
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,674
- Liar.
- That's enough.

537
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:43,800
Sam…

538
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,009
So…

539
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,389
the question is,

540
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:51,558
what are you doing here, Vivian?

541
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:53,268
Are you being a gossipmonger?

542
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:55,478
I'm looking for Galvan.

543
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,773
Why don't you try to look
for him in his own house?

544
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,070
What are you waiting for?

545
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:05,446
Why are standing there?

546
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,323
Go. Scram.

547
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:09,868
- Get the hell out of my house.
- Okay. Okay. Okay.

548
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,828
Okay. Gosh.

549
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,125
So, Auro…

550
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,627
Vivian is like your…

551
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:22,005
sister-in-law?

552
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,215
And my nightmare, Barry.

553
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:27,135
God, and my nightmare.

554
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:29,262
Oh, my gosh.

555
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:32,557
- Poor you.
- I know, right?

556
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,017
God.

557
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:45,445
I will do anything

558
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:48,489
for you to love me too, even just a bit.

559
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,576
Not everyone we love can love us back.

560
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:54,537
But, that's it for the both of us.

561
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,540
I hope you'll be content with that.

562
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,296
<i>Aurora…</i>

563
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:07,091
<i>How many times</i>
<i>did I have a chance to get away,</i>

564
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,428
<i>but I couldn't leave you</i>

565
00:32:10,511 --> 00:32:12,221
<i>because I love you.</i>

566
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:15,475
<i>I've loved you for 50 years already,</i>

567
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,937
<i>but you only made me feel it once.</i>

568
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:22,815
<i>You know and can see my love for you.</i>

569
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:26,819
<i>I was hoping you'd see me again.</i>

570
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:29,405
<i>I followed all your orders.</i>

571
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:32,283
<i>Even if I didn't want to.</i>

572
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:34,410
<i>Even if it was against my will,</i>

573
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,496
<i>and no longer right.</i>

574
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:41,250
<i>I still did it because I thought</i>

575
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,629
<i>that was the way for you to see me again.</i>

576
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:49,384
<i>Last night, you put an end to my hope.</i>

577
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,594
<i>That's why I will stop now.</i>

578
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,305
<i>So, accept my letter of resignation</i>

579
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:57,225
<i>from serving you.</i>

580
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,939
Pray, Sam,

581
00:33:03,022 --> 00:33:07,068
that nothing happens
to my daughter and my grandchild.

582
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,779
Because if something happens,

583
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:12,031
God forgive me,

584
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:13,992
I will kill you.

585
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:15,493
I will kill you!

586
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,453
Auntie Ruth, please. Listen to me first.

587
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,247
Why? Did you listen to me

588
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,124
when Ward was framed?
You didn't, remember?

589
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,209
You didn't listen.

590
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,628
You never listened to us, right?

591
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,677
We'll just check the baby.

592
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,397
No…

593
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,691
If Aurora…

594
00:33:49,152 --> 00:33:50,945
can turn her back on everything,

595
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,197
why can't I.

596
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:00,872
Why?

597
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:04,542
Why can't I leave you?

598
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,962
I love you so much, Aurora.

599
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:12,884
Leave.

600
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,677
Please, leave Sam.

601
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:17,263
Jericho, make her leave.

602
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,784
Doc, is my baby okay?

603
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,119
There's a heartbeat but…

604
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,330
But what?

605
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:50,838
The fetus is very small and vulnerable.

606
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:53,257
You had internal bleeding.

607
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,176
We stabilized it,

608
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:58,471
but the trauma has put your body
into shock.

609
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,056
Do everything, Doc.

610
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,724
We're doing everything.

611
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,268
For now, you need full bed rest.

612
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,156
Sir Amando.

613
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,616
Sir, that's enough.

614
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,159
What happened?

615
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,122
What did Ma'am Aurora do to you?

616
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,544
Don't meddle with me, Cairo.

617
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:33,881
Sir…

618
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:38,427
Whatever it is, just forget about it.

619
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:42,014
Our bosses are demons.

620
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:44,559
They are monsters.

621
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:49,689
Don't talk that way about Aurora.

622
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,275
You don't know what you're saying.

623
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:54,110
Do you understand?

624
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,037
Damn you, Ruth.

625
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:07,331
You're not answering my calls.

626
00:36:09,208 --> 00:36:11,586
Galvan, chill.

627
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:13,462
You've been like that
for quite a while now.

628
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,340
Maybe nothing will happen…

629
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:18,426
to your grandson with George.

630
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:19,969
Shut up, Vivian.

631
00:36:20,052 --> 00:36:20,887
Give me the alcohol.

632
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,121
I sided with him and yet he hurt me.

633
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,436
Hello, Sir Galvan.

634
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:13,105
Ruth, I've been calling you.

635
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:17,693
I'm sorry, Sir Galvan.
My phone is with my son,

636
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,030
but George and our grandchild
are doing okay.

637
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:22,949
<i>They just need to observe them.</i>

638
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:23,991
Ruth…

639
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:28,204
tell your daughter to be careful.

640
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:30,456
<i>She's acting like she's not pregnant.</i>

641
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,502
Sir Galvan, George was careful.

642
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,049
Sam pushed her.

643
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:43,678
What?

644
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,646
Damn you, Samantha.

645
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:02,863
Samantha is the reason
George was hospitalized?

646
00:38:03,614 --> 00:38:05,241
She's not careful.

647
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,245
Sit down first.

648
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:10,705
Galvan, relax.

649
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,206
Don't be angry.

650
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,252
- Take it easy.
- And you…

651
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,256
don't I pay you to keep an eye on George.

652
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,549
What happened?

653
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,801
Why did she get into danger?

654
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:26,012
I'm sorry, sir.
I was on break during that time.

655
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,889
And now, why are you here

656
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,767
and not at the hospital?

657
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:35,354
Ma'am Ruth asked me to get some things.

658
00:38:35,438 --> 00:38:36,814
Then hurry up.

659
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,566
Don't be slow.

660
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,526
Hurry.

661
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,575
George, George, George.

662
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:49,702
You're not being careful.

663
00:38:55,458 --> 00:38:57,251
George…

664
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,336
George…

665
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,964
- My daughter.
- How are you, George?

666
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,803
Please take care of her.

667
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,476
Thank God.

668
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,269
Is George stable?

669
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,187
<i>Yes.</i>

670
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,230
But, she's still under observation.

671
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,024
She's been transferred to a private room.

672
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:22,651
Thank you, Jericho.

673
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:24,403
Thank you for calling.

674
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,198
Ma'am Sam, I'll be honest with you,

675
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,657
I didn't like what you did.

676
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,117
Jericho, I didn't mean it.

677
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:31,702
What happened was an accident.

678
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,829
How can people believe you?

679
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:36,832
George said you pushed her.

680
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,918
No one saw what really happened.

681
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:41,420
Samantha!

682
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:49,303
Did you try to kill George
and my grandchild?

683
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:51,180
Uncle Galvan, what happened
was an accident.

684
00:39:51,263 --> 00:39:52,431
She attacked me.

685
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:54,850
Barry, I'm about to leave the house.

686
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,143
I'll see you.

687
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,686
Liar.

688
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,522
You attacked George.

689
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,315
You pushed her off the stairs.

690
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,192
She attacked me first.

691
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,069
You went to my house

692
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:09,031
and now you're saying George attacked you?

693
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:10,699
Stop, Galvan.

694
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:20,418
What the hell is happening here?

695
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:23,129
<i>She started bleeding</i>

696
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,547
<i>and became unconscious.</i>

697
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,298
- She's unresponsive.
- Doc…

698
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:27,466
Did her baby die?

699
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,677
<i>- No, right?</i>
- It looks like there's no more heartbeat.

700
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,886
So, cut the drama.

701
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,430
George's baby is gone.

702
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:35,099
- What?
<i>- No! My grandchild.</i>

703
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,934
My condolences.
That's still your grandchild.

704
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,353
Or, should I say congratulations?

705
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,604
Mom, where's my baby?

706
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,481
I want to see my baby.

707
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,485
Your grandchild is the only
remaining future Palacios.

708
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,238
It would greatly reduce the pain I feel

709
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:52,241
if you were to lose your baby.
Just like me.
