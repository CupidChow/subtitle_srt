1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>My nephew, Peter Palacios.</i>

2
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,052
What?

3
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,971
I will never accept you!

4
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:57,140
He stole your identity!

5
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:59,392
- I can't forgive what Peter did.
- And I definitely can't.

6
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,978
I want you to leave this estate.

7
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:02,979
Auntie.

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,105
Auntie Aurora.

9
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:06,524
God! Don't call me that!

10
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,610
How dare you call me Auntie Aurora?!

11
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:11,529
You can't kick me out of here.

12
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:14,282
Only Uncle Galvan can kick me out of here.

13
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,034
You…

14
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,035
are not…

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,703
a Palacios!

16
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,121
- Get out of here!
- Ma! Stop!

17
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:23,208
Let's just tell Uncle Galvan
and Auntie Aurora the truth!

18
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,210
Before I can tell them
that I am a Palacios,

19
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,252
I need to have proof.

20
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,546
Do you know that Peter is a Palacios?

21
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,590
But Aurora doesn't believe it yet.

22
00:01:30,673 --> 00:01:32,258
How about you? Do you believe him?

23
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,802
He seems to be hiding something.

24
00:01:33,885 --> 00:01:36,679
Dr. Dionela's assistant is on her way

25
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:39,224
to get your sample for your DNA Test.

26
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,893
PREVIOUSLY

27
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:00,286
Sir, we can no longer use that.

28
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,579
It might be contaminated.

29
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,539
We'll just get new samples.

30
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,165
Ma'am, I don't want to.

31
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,792
Are you hiding something, Peter?

32
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,794
Ma'am, I'm scared of needles.

33
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,963
We can also use your saliva for the test.

34
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:15,135
I will get rid of him just like I got rid
of his mother, Jessica.

35
00:02:15,218 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>No outsider can pretend</i>
<i>to be a Palacios, right?</i>

36
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,015
One of Basil's staff, Peter,
is his cousin?

37
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,725
They'll have his DNA tested,

38
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,603
but according to Papa,
his story checks out.

39
00:02:25,687 --> 00:02:26,896
<i>I will be exposed.</i>

40
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,357
Peter?

41
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,651
Are you stealing Basil's watches?

42
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:33,153
Pa! Pa!

43
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:34,863
Shut up!

44
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,114
Be quiet, ma'am!

45
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:38,408
Just let me take them, ma'am.
I just really need…

46
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,534
- Pa!
- Be quiet!

47
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,535
Be quiet!

48
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:43,997
Larry.

49
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,624
How are you, my dear?

50
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,752
How's the kid doing?

51
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,047
Can we meet?

52
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:41,971
Auro, darling.

53
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,224
Larry.

54
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,733
I so love your outfit.

55
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,693
Of course! You know me.

56
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,653
The bigger, the better.

57
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:58,696
It's been a long time.

58
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,823
I know. But you know,

59
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,825
it's you who refuses to show yourself.

60
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,745
Too busy with your gold
and your crazy family.

61
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,956
Look who's talking.

62
00:04:09,165 --> 00:04:10,667
Touché.

63
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,293
Anyway, so.

64
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,254
You want to see her?

65
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,838
See who?

66
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,382
Your grandchild.

67
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:20,885
Your granddaughter, Grandmother Auro.

68
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,932
Louie?

69
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,600
Are you there already?

70
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:28,977
Okay, I'll go out now.

71
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,812
Sofia…

72
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:35,483
Can you please stop hanging out
with your friends?

73
00:04:36,734 --> 00:04:41,030
If I were you,
start bonding with your dad.

74
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,365
Spend time with him,

75
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:46,536
especially now that there's another
outsider here in the mansion.

76
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,664
Mommy, watch your mouth!

77
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,625
You might offend someone again.

78
00:04:54,002 --> 00:04:56,296
Okay, I'll leave now.

79
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,922
Sofia…

80
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:01,319
Look at her. She's so big now.

81
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,947
Larry, I don't want to see her.

82
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,492
Please, I told you that before.

83
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,012
Wait a second.

84
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,166
Oh my God.

85
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,567
Help!

86
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:25,695
Help!

87
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:29,532
Help!

88
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,868
Help me!

89
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,412
Rebecca!

90
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:36,289
Sofia! Sofia!

91
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:37,206
Help me.

92
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,460
Help me find her.

93
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,919
Who should we look for, Rebecca?

94
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,921
The… the baby.

95
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:46,466
What baby, Rebecca?

96
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:50,386
The baby who's crying!

97
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,514
- The baby…
- Can you hear a baby crying?

98
00:07:58,936 --> 00:07:59,896
Here.

99
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,772
A baby?

100
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,608
Do you hear one?

101
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,737
Let's just help her.

102
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,490
Here…

103
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:14,577
It's here. It's in here.

104
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,705
Or maybe she's hearing a goblin.

105
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:19,290
That's not funny, Ward.

106
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,308
I'm here now, baby.

107
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,978
It's okay.

108
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,815
It's okay. It's okay now.

109
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,777
You called me to check on her,

110
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,488
and now you're telling me
you don't want to see her?

111
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,910
I have a reason why I wanted you
to adopt her.

112
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:59,622
I don't want to be attached to the kid.

113
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,625
Okay.

114
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,838
But she's okay. She's fine.

115
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:10,091
I mean, your granddaughter.

116
00:09:10,174 --> 00:09:11,259
I mean, your…

117
00:09:11,342 --> 00:09:12,677
The kid.

118
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,972
I'm taking good care of her.

119
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,140
I'm treating her like my own child.

120
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,059
That's good.

121
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,230
So where's the other one?

122
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,316
What other one?

123
00:09:30,444 --> 00:09:31,904
They were twins, remember?

124
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,537
One boy, one girl.

125
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,164
You gave me the girl.

126
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,292
Who did you give the boy to?

127
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,883
Gotta go, Larry.

128
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,427
I have a million things to do.

129
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,096
Yeah, but aren't we gonna have coffee?

130
00:09:57,888 --> 00:10:00,182
Coffee's bad for your face.

131
00:10:00,975 --> 00:10:03,144
Look at you, my dear.

132
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,522
Time for Botox again.

133
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,569
I'll see you around.

134
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:21,537
She's right.

135
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,247
I need Botox again.

136
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,796
Not until I have my coffee first.

137
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,258
Stop crying. It's okay.
Mommy is here.

138
00:10:34,342 --> 00:10:36,260
She's really crazy.

139
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:37,928
Ward.

140
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:39,680
Have some respect.

141
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:54,320
Go to sleep now.

142
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,911
You're so good at calling
people outsiders.

143
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,165
Do you really think you belong
to the Palacios clan?

144
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:13,756
Well, as for me,
I can be a Palacios anytime,

145
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,174
just like my daughter.

146
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,802
How about you?

147
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:23,140
It's the same with me.

148
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,225
Pa!

149
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:25,893
Pa!

150
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:27,895
George?

151
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,652
Ma'am, be quiet.

152
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,695
Shut up, ma'am! Shut up!

153
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:42,118
You jerk! What are you doing
to my daughter?!

154
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,954
- Did you think-- What are you--?
- Ouch!

155
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:47,039
Hey!

156
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:48,416
Ma!

157
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,126
What's happening? Why is he hurting you?

158
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:52,002
He is stealing Basil's watches!

159
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,882
Give me that! I said give me that!

160
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,093
You jerk!

161
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:00,428
Peter, you jerk!

162
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,596
I said give it to me, you demon!

163
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,558
You bastard!

164
00:12:05,641 --> 00:12:07,268
- Come here, George.
- You jerk!

165
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,145
Just let him go.

166
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,563
Let him go, George.

167
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:12,148
Pa! Pa!

168
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,074
Guard!

169
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,161
- Did you see Peter?
- No, ma'am.

170
00:12:25,244 --> 00:12:26,245
Give me that.

171
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,873
All personnel! All personnel!

172
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,542
Arrest Peter! He is a thief!

173
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,836
- Hurry, let's find him.
- Okay, ma'am.

174
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,547
Did you hear Ms. George's announcement?

175
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,300
What happened to Peter?

176
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,218
Why did he steal? He's a Palacios.

177
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,637
That jerk is not a Palacios.

178
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,431
What do you mean he's not?

179
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,061
Hello? Rebecca?

180
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:53,689
<i>Jerico. Jerico, I saw Peter.</i>

181
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,566
<i>He's on his way to the garage.</i>

182
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,818
Rebecca, don't go near that bastard.

183
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,487
Wait for us.

184
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:01,405
Rebecca?

185
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:03,407
Rebecca?

186
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:04,617
Hello, Rebecca?

187
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:12,291
Hey! You, impostor!

188
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:16,253
First, you pretended to be a Palacios,
and now you're stealing?!

189
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:17,338
You're not going anywhere!

190
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,715
Hey! You're crazy, right?

191
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,343
Why don't you go
and drink your medicine first

192
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,719
so you don't get involved in this mess?

193
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:25,262
You're crazy! Stay here!

194
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,056
Get off me!

195
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:29,016
No!

196
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,729
I warned you.

197
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:39,610
Peter!

198
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:46,200
Rebecca. Rebecca!

199
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:47,535
Ma'am Rebecca!

200
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:48,702
Are you okay?

201
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,413
Did Peter do this to you?

202
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,791
He went…

203
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,878
He went that way, to the garage.

204
00:13:59,129 --> 00:14:00,631
That bastard is so evil.

205
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,508
Take care of Rebecca.

206
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,384
- Jerico.
- Ma'am…

207
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,052
Ma'am, are you okay?

208
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:07,263
- Let's stay here.
- My phone…

209
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:23,237
All personnel, any update on Peter?

210
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,703
Guard!

211
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:32,955
Guard, stop Peter by the gate.

212
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,588
Sam! Sam, help me.

213
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,006
What's going on?

214
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:44,174
Peter stole Basil's watches.

215
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:45,801
Let's go after him! Help me!

216
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,387
No!

217
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,014
It's your problem. Why would I help you?

218
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,223
Why would you get me involved?

219
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,225
You can drive this car if you want.

220
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,896
Can we have this fight later, please?

221
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,189
I can't drive right now!
Help me!

222
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:02,026
Let's go after Peter!

223
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:20,878
George!

224
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,255
George!

225
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,341
George, get out of that car! George!

226
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,051
George!

227
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,083
Amando…

228
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,252
Just take a rest, please.

229
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,797
I'm doing okay, Ma'am Aurora.

230
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,758
Amando, just go.

231
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:09,301
We might get sick too.

232
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,429
Excuse me, madam.

233
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:20,896
All these talks

234
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:24,984
about Palacios Mining losing its heirs

235
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,443
are nonsense.

236
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,820
And yet, because of them,

237
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,907
our share prices in the stock market
are being pulled down, Galvan.

238
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,118
I know.

239
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:41,250
That's the reason why Peter's arrival
is perfect timing.

240
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,212
Listen, Aurora.

241
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:47,214
We can actually use this.

242
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:54,263
We can recover in the market
once we introduce him as the new Palacios.

243
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:01,770
Are you really out of your mind, Galvan?

244
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,734
You will really introduce that garbage
as one of us?

245
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:08,402
Why not?

246
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:12,823
You know, I'm sure the public
would love it.

247
00:17:14,908 --> 00:17:19,329
A rags-to-riches male Cinderella
in our midst.

248
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:22,958
Maybe this is what we need
to boost our sales.

249
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,838
Galvan! Galvan!

250
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:31,717
It's Peter!

251
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,179
George caught Peter stealing.

252
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:36,930
What?

253
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,684
Peter? A thief?

254
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,896
Oh my God! I'm shocked!

255
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,316
Where is Peter?

256
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,817
He escaped!

257
00:17:48,901 --> 00:17:49,860
Let's go!

258
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:55,282
Peter is a thief, Galvan!

259
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,253
- Sam, hurry!
- I'm driving as fast as I can!

260
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:12,132
Why do you want to catch Peter when
you can easily replace what he stole?

261
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,133
This is dangerous.

262
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:14,343
No, Sam.

263
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:18,055
Each watch from Basil's collection
has sentimental value.

264
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,014
And it's not just that.

265
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,766
His wedding ring is also there.

266
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,601
You know how important a wedding ring is,

267
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,229
most especially if it belongs
to your dead husband.

268
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,737
Hello, Sergeant Villa?

269
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,280
I've been calling you.

270
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,199
Yes, ma'am, what's up?

271
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:41,161
Peter Pambid, one of our staff
at the Palacios' Estate, stole something.

272
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,706
I caught him, and he tried to strangle me.
He almost killed me.

273
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:47,543
What? Where is he right now?

274
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,421
He escaped, but Sam and I
are going after him right now.

275
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,881
<i>Ma'am, listen.</i>

276
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,008
Stop what you're doing.

277
00:18:55,092 --> 00:18:56,718
That's dangerous.
You're putting yourself at risk.

278
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,470
Just tell us where he is.

279
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,515
<i>Just along Jacinto Highway.</i>

280
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,433
He hasn't gone far from the estate.

281
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:06,270
What kind of car is he driving?
Color, plate number?

282
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:08,021
It's a red car.

283
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:11,191
Plate number PSP1988.

284
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:14,027
Okay. We're on our way.
We'll take care of it.

285
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:24,872
He tried to strangle you?

286
00:19:25,622 --> 00:19:26,832
Yes.

287
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,417
I think my suspicion is right.

288
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,752
He's the one who killed Basil and Beverly.

289
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:32,421
There's something off about him.

290
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,089
Oh, please. Stop it.

291
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,091
You accuse everybody!

292
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,177
The last time we spoke, it was Jerico.

293
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,095
Now, it's Peter.

294
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,014
Wait.

295
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,686
He took a right turn.

296
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,021
He took a right turn?

297
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,940
I think I know where he's going.

298
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,735
I think I know too.

299
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,856
What was George thinking?

300
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,275
She went after Peter
and got Sam involved too?

301
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,319
Mercy, please stop nagging me.

302
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,529
I also don't like what George did!

303
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:43,784
What's the update about George?

304
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,995
I've been calling her
but she's rejecting my calls!

305
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:49,122
- What?
- Wait, let me try again.

306
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,041
Did they find Peter?

307
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:53,293
He's left the estate.

308
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,630
George went after Peter
and took Sam with her.

309
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,298
What do you mean she took Sam?

310
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:00,592
George made Sam drive for her.

311
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,678
Why didn't you stop her, Mercy?

312
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,012
You know that Sam is pregnant.

313
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,599
And you, Ruth? Why did you let
your stupid daughter go?

314
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,060
What kind of mothers are you?

315
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:11,937
My daughter is not stupid.

316
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:13,814
Let's not fight.

317
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:15,983
We're all just worried about our children.

318
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,902
- That's right.
- I'm not worried about your children!

319
00:21:18,986 --> 00:21:20,570
I'm worried about my grandchild!

320
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,494
Amando!

321
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,620
Amando!

322
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,623
Call General Alejaga!

323
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:16,084
George, wait!

324
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,133
Who are you, you sick bastard?

325
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:06,676
You're an animal!

326
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,972
Who are you, you jerk?

327
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,615
General Alejaga.

328
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:33,578
No! I want you to prioritize
my daughter-in-law, Sam.

329
00:23:33,662 --> 00:23:38,041
Tell your men to find her
and bring her to safety!

330
00:23:52,055 --> 00:23:53,932
What's wrong, Galvan?

331
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:57,310
I just received an email from Dr. Dionela.

332
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:00,313
The DNA test result?

333
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,275
Yes.

334
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,610
It's a negative.

335
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,657
Peter is not a Palacios.

336
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,285
I already told you that, right?

337
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,911
You were just being stubborn!

338
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:20,250
You look devastated, Galvan.

339
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,044
My God!

340
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,841
Did you actually believe that
Peter was a Palacios?

341
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,218
You're pathetic.

342
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,555
Once they catch Peter,

343
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,100
I'll make him pay!

344
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,905
You?

345
00:24:58,496 --> 00:25:00,665
George, call Sergeant Villa.

346
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:04,169
Sam, I think we're right.
He went here to hide.

347
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:07,047
George, call him now!

348
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:10,967
Hello, Sergeant Villa?

349
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,013
We found the car.

350
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,973
He's here outside the warehouse.

351
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,268
Ma'am…

352
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,730
You really did follow him?
Didn't I tell you not to?

353
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,690
Oh, come on.
Save your nagging for later.

354
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,067
Are you on your way now or what?

355
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:28,818
We're five minutes away.

356
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:29,861
Get out of there.

357
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,738
It's risky. You might be in danger.

358
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:35,951
Hello, ma'am?

359
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:38,245
Ma'am, get out of there right now.

360
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:39,246
Ma'am?

361
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,544
Men, follow me.

362
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:47,837
Let's go to Palacios Mining.

363
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,005
Now!

364
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:02,769
George, let's wait for Sergeant Villa.

365
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:05,772
Sam, there's blood.

366
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:08,108
There's blood.

367
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:15,615
George!

368
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,034
George…

369
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:20,161
George, come back here. What's with you?

370
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:23,456
Sam, it looks like
something's happened to Peter!

371
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:32,924
Peter?

372
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,141
Peter?

373
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:49,983
Peter!

374
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,825
George, call an ambulance.

375
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,660
We need to bring him to the hospital.

376
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:02,829
George, call an ambulance.

377
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:03,872
Let's call an ambulance.

378
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:05,248
He might…

379
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,666
He's gone, Sam!

380
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,710
Peter is dead!

381
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,382
I didn't want this to happen!

382
00:27:14,466 --> 00:27:16,843
All I wanted was to get back
the things he stole,

383
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,094
but not this.

384
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,388
Who killed him, Sam?

385
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,015
Who?

386
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,200
Mrs. Palacios,

387
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:42,702
I specifically told you to leave
this area, didn't I?

388
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,376
Sergeant Villa, we understand
and we apologize.

389
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:50,877
No, you're not.

390
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,588
This is a crime scene.

391
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:55,757
You shouldn't have come near this place.

392
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,843
You have possibly muddled
or contaminated this area!

393
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:05,850
Do you know that because of what you did,
our investigation might be compromised?

394
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,520
I just checked Peter's pulse.

395
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:10,688
Aside from that, we didn't touch anything.

396
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,527
And you can check my dash cam.

397
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:17,487
We didn't touch anything.

398
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,656
Okay, since you came here first,

399
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:21,699
aside from the victim,

400
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:24,994
did you see anyone else?

401
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:27,205
No.

402
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,959
Okay, you can go back to the estate.

403
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,004
I'll go there once we're done
with our investigation here.

404
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,099
Check it out.
Your sister might have arrived.

405
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:41,279
George!

406
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,864
Sam!

407
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:52,081
George, I've been calling you.
What happened, George?

408
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,250
Never mind, I'm just glad you're safe.

409
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:56,336
George.

410
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:58,004
George, what were you thinking?

411
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:01,257
Why did you take Sam with you
when you went after Peter?

412
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,551
And why did you agree?

413
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:08,431
You both put my grandchild in danger.

414
00:30:09,098 --> 00:30:10,934
Are you not using your heads?

415
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:17,524
You're supposed to be educated women!

416
00:30:17,607 --> 00:30:19,776
Where did your brains go?

417
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:26,908
Did they catch Peter?

418
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,243
Is he in jail?

419
00:30:33,915 --> 00:30:36,042
Pa, Peter is already dead.

420
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,377
What?

421
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:42,006
Good for him.

422
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:47,345
Ma, even if Peter was a thief,
he was still a Palacios.

423
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:50,390
That man was a fake, Sam.

424
00:30:51,057 --> 00:30:52,725
He was not a Palacios!

425
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,183
No…

426
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:39,606
No…

427
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,442
Rebecca?

428
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:55,204
Rebecca, I wasn't able to catch Peter.

429
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,044
Jerico…

430
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,005
I just talked to Cairo.

431
00:32:10,094 --> 00:32:12,347
Peter is dead.

432
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,101
How did that happen?

433
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,479
Someone attacked him.

434
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,856
Someone hit his head.

435
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:25,234
Who did it? Did the police see?

436
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:28,279
There's no update about that.

437
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,502
Why are you crying?

438
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,550
I feel guilty.

439
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:51,552
I feel guilty

440
00:32:51,636 --> 00:32:54,973
because this wouldn't have happened

441
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:59,602
if we'd told them that
you were Papa's missing son.

442
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,479
Peter wouldn't have…

443
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,982
Peter wouldn't have done that

444
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,526
and he would still be alive right now.

445
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,444
Right?

446
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:13,992
It's not our fault.

447
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:18,621
It was Peter's decision
to steal my identity.

448
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,331
It was his decision to steal.

449
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,254
Stop crying.

450
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,716
It's not our fault.

451
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,975
The opportunist thief, Peter, is gone.

452
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:44,605
One tear.

453
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,818
If even one tear drops from your eyes,

454
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,946
you're out of this estate for good.

455
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,866
Do you agree, Galvan?

456
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:59,203
Or are you going to defend
that scammer again?

457
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,000
If there's one thing I regret,

458
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:09,005
it's that I wasn't the one
who killed that imposter.

459
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,801
So, Peter was not a Palacios.

460
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:18,139
But his story was…

461
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,349
The DNA results came back.

462
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,936
That imposter lied.

463
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:28,191
There's only one new Palacios,
no one else,

464
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:31,611
and that's Sam's future child.

465
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:32,820
My grandchild.

466
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,033
No. You're wrong, Auntie Aurora.

467
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:38,785
You're wrong.

468
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:51,756
Everything Peter said about
Papa and Jessica is true.

469
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:54,675
Peter was the only fake part
of that story.

470
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,512
Rebecca, what do you mean?

471
00:34:58,596 --> 00:35:00,431
Papa and Jessica had a baby.

472
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,351
But it wasn't Peter.

473
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,355
Come on, Rebecca.

474
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:11,359
So? What do you mean?

475
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,862
That there's another Palacios?

476
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,447
What's the truth?

477
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,075
We did the test

478
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,285
and it was positive.

479
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,122
We're really siblings.

480
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:26,499
- Siblings?
- Yeah.

481
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,252
Who's this sibling you're talking about?

482
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,003
Here, Uncle.

483
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,050
The DNA result.

484
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:58,990
Jerico?

485
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,241
What?

486
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:11,460
God!

487
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,671
Another helper?

488
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,852
I don't care, Aurora!

489
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:30,229
He's a true Palacios!

490
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,453
Good evening.

491
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:48,164
Sergeant Emil Royales.

492
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:53,628
Royales?

493
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:58,674
Are you in any way related
to Basil's friend, Beatrice?

494
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,635
We're cousins.

495
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:01,928
So,

496
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:05,848
what is a Royales doing here?

497
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,851
Ma'am, I'm the new lead investigator,

498
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:13,648
and we are here because we have a lead
on what happened to Mr. Peter Pambid.

499
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,417
At first, it happens to be
a robbery gone wrong.

500
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:36,837
Peter must have wanted
to hide at the mine,

501
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:40,132
but someone tried to rob him.

502
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:46,472
So the thief was robbed by another thief.

503
00:37:46,555 --> 00:37:51,227
Our theory is that he
and his assailant knew each other.

504
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,606
Peter?

505
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:05,199
What was used to hit Peter?

506
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:09,287
<i>We're thinking one of two things.</i>

507
00:38:11,455 --> 00:38:13,249
<i>If it wasn't a pipe…</i>

508
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:19,005
<i>then a baseball bat was used by the killer</i>

509
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,674
<i>to kill Mr. Pambid.</i>

510
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,177
So who killed him?

511
00:38:27,346 --> 00:38:29,640
Our theory is that it was his accomplice.

512
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,226
He had an accomplice?

513
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,603
The watches are no longer
at the crime scene.

514
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:39,400
We suspect that Peter
and his accomplice met.

515
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:43,154
Then, the killer took all the watches
and killed Peter.

516
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:49,410
We have to find this killer to get back
Basil's watches and his wedding ring.

517
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:53,372
Why don't you ask for help
from Sergeant Casas?

518
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:54,832
Your ex?

519
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:59,587
Oh, I forgot. He's no longer
in charge of this case.

520
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,593
Ma'am, regardless of which member of
our force is in charge of the case,

521
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,804
we will do our best
to recover the stolen items

522
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,598
and to find Peter's killer.

523
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,603
Let that be a lesson to all of you.

524
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:20,358
Karma moves quicker than a thief.

525
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:26,822
So don't ever steal something
that is not yours,

526
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:30,117
or else you'll end up like Peter.

527
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:34,205
Dead, burning in hell.

528
00:39:34,288 --> 00:39:36,832
Oh, please, Aurora. That's enough!

529
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,293
It's your fault, Galvan.

530
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:43,172
You were too excited about finding
a replacement for Basil.

531
00:39:43,255 --> 00:39:44,465
Look what happened.

532
00:39:44,548 --> 00:39:46,425
You got robbed!

533
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:48,135
Yeah.

534
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,846
Peter didn't just steal
Basil's collection of watches.

535
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,641
He stole Jerico's identity too.

536
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:57,395
Guys, Jerico is our real relative.

537
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,774
Jerico is the real Palacios.

538
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:05,027
Jerico…

539
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:07,071
Come on, tell them.

540
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,949
Please, tell them the truth.

541
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,502
I am the real son of Rodolfo Palacios.

542
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,549
What Peter said about Papa…

543
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,342
he learned all of that from me.

544
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:33,639
But why are you only speaking up now,

545
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:38,352
and not when Peter was claiming
that he was the real Palacios?

546
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,395
Sam.

547
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:42,064
Because we've been waiting for this.

548
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:46,110
For the DNA result
proving that he is the real Palacios.

549
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,949
Jerico, welcome to the family!

550
00:40:52,032 --> 00:40:53,033
No!

551
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,577
Galvan!

552
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,038
Do not welcome him, not until…

553
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,000
this result is verified.

554
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,502
Because, you know,

555
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,256
with all the liars and thieves here,

556
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:11,051
we don't know who is telling
the truth and who is not!

557
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:16,432
You can do what you want,

558
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:19,143
but I am ready to prove that
what I'm saying is true.

559
00:41:25,858 --> 00:41:27,234
Whatever.

560
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:29,695
I'm sure you're only after one thing.

561
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:30,613
Money.

562
00:41:32,656 --> 00:41:34,575
Excuse me, ma'am.

563
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,494
I didn't come here for money,

564
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,871
so please don't compare me to you.

565
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,959
And what do you mean?

566
00:41:44,835 --> 00:41:45,920
You're something else.

567
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:47,588
Are you saying that
I'm only after the money?

568
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,257
I will answer that, Vivian.

569
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,552
Yes, you're only after the money.

570
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,932
And you, Jerico…

571
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:01,519
If you're not after the money…

572
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,607
what is it that you want?

573
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,113
Family.

574
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,157
I want a family.

575
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:34,009
<i>Auro, darling!</i>

576
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,720
<i>You have a fabulous visitor today!</i>

577
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:39,056
<i>You're not supposed to go here.</i>

578
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:43,811
You might tell Rebecca about her babies.

579
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,563
And we owe you that debt of gratitude?

580
00:42:45,646 --> 00:42:46,897
Of course!

581
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:49,316
Maybe you've forgotten?

582
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:53,779
I saved you from your miseries, Larry.

583
