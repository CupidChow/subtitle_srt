00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,265
PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:15,348 --> 00:00:17,559
Ms. Trano, you'd better surrender.

3
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,020
You will never catch me alive.

4
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:24,107
We'll kill each other first
before you catch me.

5
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:31,114
<i>Your mother's greed has consumed her.</i>

6
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:33,616
You made her greedy, Dad.

7
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,702
You and your family.

8
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:38,621
You killed Mommy.

9
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:42,751
Mom Aurora is behind all of this.

10
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:44,502
She is the mastermind.

11
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:45,628
That's why I won't stop.

12
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,005
I won't stop until I put her behind bars.

13
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:49,716
Sis, the baby might get involved.

14
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,801
I can't stop, George.

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:55,180
For Dad and Francis,
and for all those who died.

16
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,514
<i>I'm ashamed.</i>

17
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,807
<i>I'm guilty, Ward.</i>

18
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:03,271
Sofia, it wasn't you who framed me,
so you shouldn't feel guilty, okay?

19
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,564
I'm sorry, Ward.

20
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,567
<i>I just came here to say my condolences.</i>

21
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,152
<i>I'm so sorry for your loss.</i>

22
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,488
Actually, Vivian and I have been
separated for a long time.

23
00:01:11,571 --> 00:01:13,156
I'm sad, yes,

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:17,160
but I'm more bothered
because of my daughter.

25
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:20,371
Bro, my cousin's life is in danger,

26
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,123
so if you need to triple the team,

27
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,376
do it just to find her. ASAP.

28
00:01:27,337 --> 00:01:28,922
What's the update? What's the news?

29
00:01:29,005 --> 00:01:30,340
Did they find Rebecca?

30
00:01:31,841 --> 00:01:35,261
We must announce this
to the press, the media, and social media.

31
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,388
Maybe that's more dangerous.

32
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,767
The Palacios killer
might get ahead of us in finding her.

33
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,603
And Auntie Aurora doesn't like that.

34
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:46,564
She's so toxic with the press.

35
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:48,358
That's because she's hiding
a lot of things.

36
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:11,089
Ward, Mom is gone.

37
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,551
She has already left me.

38
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:22,100
All my life, my Mom has been there for me.

39
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,480
From the time I woke up
until I went to sleep.

40
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:31,151
I see her and hear her.

41
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,487
What will happen to me now?

42
00:02:35,196 --> 00:02:37,490
I am here for you, Sofia.

43
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,951
I am scared, Ward.

44
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:44,247
Now that she's gone,
no one will defend me.

45
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,794
Me. I will defend you.

46
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,008
Stop crying.

47
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,468
It's okay, Sofia.

48
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,930
She's blaming me
for what happened to her mommy.

49
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,810
I guess kids are like that these days.

50
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:10,481
But, you know, just be grateful.

51
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,276
Because you're still with your daughter.

52
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:15,194
You're right.

53
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,280
I'm just a bit hurt

54
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,782
because Sofia is putting
all the blame on me.

55
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:22,994
She says her mommy became like that

56
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,581
because I didn't love her enough.

57
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:37,508
Good thing that you and Sofia
are together.

58
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,678
We've been looking for you
to offer our sympathies.

59
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:45,266
The pain of losing a loved one
is still fresh for me.

60
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:49,229
So, whenever you need someone to talk to,

61
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:51,981
I am here. We are here.

62
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:58,696
Please, can you stop being fake?

63
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,246
All my life,

64
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,539
I only truly loved one woman,

65
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:13,127
but she didn't give me a chance.

66
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,964
She rejected me again and again.

67
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:24,847
So, are you still into gambling?

68
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,475
Do you still go to casinos?

69
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:31,729
Not really. I find that place boring.

70
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,023
Why do you ask?

71
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:37,735
Nothing, I just remembered.

72
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,738
Auro was telling me before…

73
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:44,450
that your father didn't trust you

74
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:47,662
to hold a key position in Palacios Mining

75
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,206
because you were into gambling.

76
00:04:50,999 --> 00:04:52,542
Hell, no. That's not true.

77
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,669
So, you mean to say they were all lies?

78
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,256
And how…

79
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:01,009
you abuse your female helpers?

80
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:02,677
Of course not.

81
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:03,803
I am not…

82
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,305
Wait…

83
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,474
Is that what Aurora told you?

84
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:13,813
What else did Aurora tell you about me?

85
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,487
I know you're also mad at Mommy.

86
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,907
Maybe you even became happy when she died.

87
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,452
Especially you, Auntie Mercy.

88
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:30,788
I know you're mad at her…

89
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,916
because she killed Francis.

90
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,465
I will admit it to you.

91
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:43,301
I am extremely angry with your mommy.

92
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:47,346
But, you're not at fault
for what happened.

93
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:51,225
That's why my sympathy for you is true.

94
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,572
Ward, follow her.

95
00:06:04,655 --> 00:06:06,282
Don't let her be alone.

96
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,159
Yes, Ward, be with Sofia.

97
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,827
She needs someone by her side.

98
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:11,079
Yes, Mom.

99
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:28,429
Oh, there you are, Barry.

100
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,972
Hello, Galvan.

101
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,433
One of the staff told me
that my bestie is here,

102
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,393
so I'm here to pick her up.

103
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:37,522
Because I have a lot
of juicy stories to tell.

104
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,069
What's with those looks?

105
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,487
Barry?

106
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,032
I don't want to talk to you right now.

107
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:51,285
Huh? Barry?

108
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,666
Galvan, what just happened?

109
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,252
I'll deal with you later.

110
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,760
What's the problem with those two?

111
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:15,852
Barbara…

112
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,063
Barbara, wait.

113
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:24,444
What else did Aurora tell you about me?

114
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,738
Look, Galvan. Let's not talk about it.

115
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:29,115
I want to know.

116
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,289
It's all in the past.
Let's not go back to that.

117
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,793
But, I just want to say sorry

118
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:45,047
because I believed everything she said
about you before.

119
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,216
Barbara, please.

120
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:49,343
I want to know.

121
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,972
If Aurora didn't bad-mouth me before,
is there a chance…

122
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,433
Possibly… Maybe…

123
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,186
we could've had a chance before.

124
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,023
I hadn't met Enrico that time.

125
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,777
Look, I'm sorry but I have to go.

126
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,878
Aurora, this is all your fault.

127
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:32,720
You…

128
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,224
Aurora told me last night

129
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,767
that you're a Palacios.

130
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:42,522
Are you the son of Jessa?

131
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:43,981
Do you know my mother?

132
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:45,900
Of course.

133
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,069
How can I forget her?

134
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:53,157
A woman who experienced worse
than 20 telenovelas

135
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,867
because of Aurora.

136
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:20,685
I know Auntie Aurora oppressed Mom.

137
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,022
Darling, she did not only oppress her.

138
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,150
Aurora did horrible things to Jessa.

139
00:09:29,443 --> 00:09:33,781
You know if Vivian's life
became tragic with Galvan,

140
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,034
you can consider hers heaven

141
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:40,621
compared to what your mother
went through with Rodolfo

142
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,373
because of Aurora.

143
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:47,878
That's why, you know, if I were you,

144
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,798
I'd seek revenge on Aurora.

145
00:10:07,273 --> 00:10:08,566
Miss…

146
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:09,734
Edgar, wait.

147
00:10:09,817 --> 00:10:10,985
Wait.

148
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,029
Wait, don't go near her.
Maybe it's a scam.

149
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:14,697
There are people who pretend
that they were hit

150
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,282
and then they ask for money.

151
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,701
No, it seems like she really fainted.

152
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,369
Wait a second. Wait.

153
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:33,049
Jericho, are you okay?

154
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:41,098
I suddenly remembered…

155
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:46,020
the story about what Mom
went through with the Palacios.

156
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,483
Every time I remember that,

157
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,570
I feel so crushed for her.

158
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,158
It hurts so much.

159
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,370
But I can't give up.

160
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,081
I have to be strong,

161
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,126
especially now that Rebecca is missing.

162
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,046
I need to find her.

163
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:18,386
That's why, Sam, I'm sorry.

164
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,889
I know you're her real sister,

165
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,225
but I still treat her the same.

166
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:40,950
Miss.

167
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,872
Mister, let's help her.

168
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,624
We need to take her to the hospital.

169
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,501
- Okay. Let's go.
- Miss, wake up.

170
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,044
- Be careful, please.
- Miss…

171
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,212
Miss…

172
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:08,686
Who are you?

173
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,313
Miss…

174
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,401
- Did you bring me back to the facility?
- Calm down.

175
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,737
I am Lilet Matias.

176
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,281
I am a lawyer.

177
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:25,619
The doctor said you fainted
because of fatigue and dehydration.

178
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,038
What happened to you?

179
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,251
You're a lawyer?

180
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,674
Here.

181
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:50,603
Thank you, Lord.

182
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,022
Thank you for saving me.

183
00:12:53,522 --> 00:12:55,649
It's fate that brought me to you.

184
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,028
Lilet…

185
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:01,780
Attorney, I need your help.

186
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:05,993
I need your help. I need a lawyer.

187
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:15,836
Aurora.

188
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:18,631
Aurora.

189
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,593
You're so evil.

190
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,763
You know how much I love Barbara.

191
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,473
Why did you destroy her view of me?

192
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,977
So, that's what happened.

193
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,272
That explains yours
and Barbara's reaction towards me.

194
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:37,900
You both dig up the past.

195
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,401
Why, Aurora?

196
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:40,861
Why?

197
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,405
Because that's the only way
to protect you, Galvan.

198
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:46,367
Protect me? Or control me?

199
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,663
Did you escape
from the mental health facility?

200
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:53,541
Do you feel that you're not safe there?
Is that why you escaped?

201
00:13:53,624 --> 00:13:54,959
No, no, no.

202
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:57,253
It's perfectly safe there.

203
00:13:58,128 --> 00:14:01,423
They took care of me and cured me.

204
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:03,801
My doctor told me

205
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:08,931
that my psychological
examination results are clear.

206
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,977
If that's the case…

207
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,478
why did you escape?

208
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:19,108
Why didn't you wait for them
to release you?

209
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:24,363
Auntie Aurora won't let me leave.

210
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,115
Why?

211
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,660
She wants me
to stay in the facility because…

212
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:34,623
she knows I will look for my children
who she gave away.

213
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,752
That's what you do.

214
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:42,381
You control the lives
of the people around you.

215
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,801
Paco is the only one you can't control.

216
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,219
- That's not true.
- It is.

217
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:50,598
You weren't able to control him
when he married Sam, right?

218
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,686
And Rebecca, look at what you did to her.

219
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,564
All her life you controlled her.

220
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,774
Maybe that's the reason
she escaped from the facility

221
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,610
to get away from you.

222
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:09,033
Everything I did was for my family.

223
00:15:09,116 --> 00:15:11,285
It was all for your own good.

224
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:13,579
I just protected you.

225
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,665
You did not protect anyone.

226
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,127
And Rebecca,

227
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:22,421
you ruined her life.

228
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,756
And me,

229
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:28,427
you destroyed my chance
to be happy with Barbara.

230
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,679
You don't know her, Galvan.

231
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,598
Barbara is poison.

232
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:34,725
I know she will only hurt you.

233
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,227
That's why I separated you two back then.

234
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:40,648
You're too good for her.

235
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,359
Who are you to meddle in my life,

236
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,071
to decide who I want?

237
00:15:47,154 --> 00:15:51,533
The sister who loves and cares
so much for you, Galvan.

238
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:03,253
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia
more than five years ago.

239
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:06,006
I don't know how,

240
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:10,344
but I lost my memory when I got pregnant.

241
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,098
Did you get pregnant?

242
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,725
So, you have a husband? Where is he?

243
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,020
A boyfriend. His name is Tonyo.

244
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:25,526
He was a poor miner
who Auntie Aurora disapproved of.

245
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,032
She separated us

246
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,786
and Tonyo died in a mining explosion…

247
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,122
when we tried to elope.

248
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,710
It broke me.

249
00:16:46,672 --> 00:16:48,132
I couldn't accept it.

250
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,762
Look at Basil's mom, Criselda.

251
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,932
Did I object when you became a couple?
I didn't, remember?

252
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,684
Because she's perfect for you.

253
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,604
Sadly, she died early.

254
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:06,650
The only reason I married Criselda

255
00:17:07,151 --> 00:17:09,153
is because I got hurt with Barbara.

256
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,780
But, if we're talking about love,

257
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,575
I didn't love any other woman

258
00:17:15,075 --> 00:17:16,744
except for Barbara.

259
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,954
Dad.

260
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,958
So, that's why is seems like
what happened to Mom

261
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,918
is nothing to you.
Because you never loved her.

262
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,880
Maybe you're happy with
what happened to her, right?

263
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,609
It was so traumatic for me

264
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:55,783
and I think that's why
I developed my ailment.

265
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,202
No, no. Stop accusing Jericho.

266
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,453
He is innocent.

267
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,788
I'm the killer!

268
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:02,748
I poisoned Basil.

269
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:04,249
I killed Paco.

270
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:06,960
I stabbed Paco.

271
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:10,297
I stabbed Paco
because he took Tonyo away from me.

272
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,965
Auntie, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

273
00:18:12,049 --> 00:18:12,925
See?

274
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:15,928
My son Paco wasn't stabbed.

275
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:17,679
He fell off the cliff.

276
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:20,224
<i>Sam, I saw Paco.</i>

277
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,476
<i>Did he show himself to you too?</i>

278
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:23,685
No.

279
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,230
Sam, his soul is restless…

280
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:28,065
because he was killed.

281
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,692
For a dead loved one,
justice is to be done.

282
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,194
Justice is to be done.

283
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,910
Along with that is your pregnancy
that you don't remember?

284
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,623
I just discovered it recently

285
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,544
when I confronted Auntie Aurora about it.

286
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:49,461
But…

287
00:18:51,338 --> 00:18:56,176
When I did, I snapped and I attacked her.

288
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,345
No! No, Rebecca.

289
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,472
Rebecca, no.

290
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,390
No, Rebecca!

291
00:19:01,473 --> 00:19:03,892
No! No, Rebecca…

292
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,895
Rebecca… Rebecca…

293
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:09,189
Rebecca, please. Please…

294
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,859
Rebecca, no, no, no.

295
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,861
No, please.

296
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,990
That's when she sent me to the facility.

297
00:19:18,615 --> 00:19:21,702
Just stay here. Rebecca. Rebecca.

298
00:19:21,785 --> 00:19:23,537
No!

299
00:19:24,037 --> 00:19:25,122
Rebecca!

300
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,917
I got mad, of course.

301
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,504
But you know what, I think I needed it.

302
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:35,674
I needed to get well for my children.

303
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,303
That's why I followed everything
they asked me to do

304
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,929
in the facility.

305
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,433
I drank all the medicines.

306
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,314
Attorney, I need your help.

307
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:53,442
Please, help me get my children back.

308
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:59,239
I want to help you so much but…

309
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,158
I'm a PAO lawyer.

310
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:06,205
And you're not qualified to be my client
because you're a Palacios.

311
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,498
By name, yes,

312
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,126
but I can and will prove to you

313
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,546
my lack of access to finances.

314
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:19,092
Attorney, Auntie Aurora controlled
all of my inheritance.

315
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:24,723
Okay. Ah, all right.

316
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:28,268
But, I need to check everything first
before I make a decision.

317
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:34,149
I also need to talk to the people
from St. Ignatius Mental Health Facility.

318
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:37,277
I can't just listen to you.

319
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,492
Lino Gambao.

320
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:47,120
He is the head doctor.

321
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,665
You can ask him about me.

322
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,712
But the truth is, I am scared

323
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:02,594
because he might not tell the truth.

324
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:06,265
I am a lawyer.

325
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:09,643
I won't let him lie to me.

326
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:28,704
Yes. I was the one who ran Francis over.

327
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,789
You have to tell
Sergeant Royales what you've done.

328
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:32,958
You have to explain it to him
and admit it to him.

329
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,002
What do you think of me?
Stupid, just like you?

330
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:37,921
If I do that, what will they do to me?

331
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,256
They will arrest me

332
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,174
and put me in jail.

333
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:43,844
So, I won't allow that to happen.
It can't be.

334
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,012
I won't allow it.

335
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,517
Mommy, I told you

336
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,728
to just surrender,

337
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,856
but you didn't listen to me.

338
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:05,615
Sofia, my child.

339
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:15,959
What's the update from your friend?

340
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,628
Any news about Rebecca?

341
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,631
CCTV footage of her
was taken along Jacinto Avenue.

342
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,050
Maybe she hasn't gone far yet.

343
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:26,011
Come on, let's go.

344
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:29,097
Sam, don't go with them
to search for Rebecca.

345
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,017
George, I've already lost one sibling.

346
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,685
I don't want to lose another.

347
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:37,397
Jericho will eventually find Rebecca.

348
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,025
Please stay.

349
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:42,527
I won't allow you
to keep stressing my son.

350
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:45,489
Your son?

351
00:22:57,834 --> 00:22:59,211
It's true, Sofia.

352
00:23:01,046 --> 00:23:03,131
I love Barbara so much.

353
00:23:06,343 --> 00:23:10,388
But, it doesn't mean
that I don't love your mommy.

354
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:16,353
I thought Vivian would replace Barbara
and Criselda in my heart.

355
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,941
I was planning on marrying
your mommy before.

356
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:24,778
Then what happened?

357
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,739
I lost my love for her.

358
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:32,119
She's ambitious and greedy for money.

359
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,830
She loved my money more than me.

360
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:40,210
And most of all, I didn't marry her
because she refused to change.

361
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,295
She's still loud.

362
00:23:47,717 --> 00:23:49,970
I'm your baby's second mommy.

363
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:51,555
You said so yourself.

364
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:53,890
That's why it's like he's my baby too.

365
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:55,684
It's my responsibility

366
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,728
to make sure
that he is always safe. So please,

367
00:23:58,812 --> 00:23:59,896
listen to me.

368
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,611
George, I appreciate your concern,

369
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,322
but I want to be there

370
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,867
once they find Rebecca.

371
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,416
Hello, who is this?

372
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,168
<i>Jericho, this is Rebecca.</i>

373
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:22,836
Rebecca.

374
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,172
Rebecca, where are you? We will go to you.

375
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:32,721
That's not true.

376
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,640
- It's true.
- Stop making stories about Mom.

377
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,434
It's true, Sofia.

378
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:42,647
I already broke off with her before,

379
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,816
but then you were born.

380
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:50,405
The moment I saw you, my heart melted.

381
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,619
I accepted her again because of you…

382
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,080
because I love you, my child.

383
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,878
Sofia, I lost everything,

384
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,467
your elder brother Basil,
my grandchildren, everyone.

385
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,972
You're the only one I have left.

386
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:21,394
So please, I'm begging you.

387
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,521
Don't leave me.

388
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,859
If you leave me,
there will be nothing left for me.

389
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:30,946
Dad…

390
00:25:31,446 --> 00:25:34,366
Please, Sofia. I'm begging you. Please…

391
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:36,243
Daddy…

392
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:51,174
Thanks for coming, Doc.

393
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,551
Rebecca is telling the truth,
Attorney Matias.

394
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,638
She's already well.

395
00:25:57,305 --> 00:25:59,307
She's even ready for release.

396
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,068
Rebecca…

397
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:15,156
About your request not to tell
your Auntie Aurora that you've been found,

398
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,492
I'm sorry, but I have to.

399
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:21,538
It's my responsibility
to tell your legal guardian.

400
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:27,544
I understand, Doc,
but is it okay not to do it now?

401
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:31,339
Because I still have to consult
with Attorney about something?

402
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,341
Thank you.

403
00:26:36,344 --> 00:26:38,638
It's your brother, Jericho. He's calling.

404
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:39,723
Jericho?

405
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:43,935
Jericho.

406
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,812
How are you feeling?

407
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:47,564
<i>I'm great.</i>

408
00:26:47,647 --> 00:26:51,943
<i>Actually, I will be discharged in a while.</i>

409
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:54,779
Jericho, by the way,

410
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:57,532
<i>this is Attorney Lilet Matias</i>
<i>and that's my doctor.</i>

411
00:26:58,325 --> 00:26:59,784
This is my brother, Jericho.

412
00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:01,828
<i>Hello.</i>

413
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:05,749
<i>Thank you so much for helping Rebecca.</i>

414
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,420
Dr. De los Reyes,
can I talk to you in private?

415
00:27:10,503 --> 00:27:12,672
<i>There's something I want</i>
<i>to consult you about.</i>

416
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,133
Sure.

417
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,482
General Alejaga…

418
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:32,317
What kind of people do you have?

419
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:36,488
They can't find one person…
They are useless.

420
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:40,325
May I remind you
that I'm doing you a favor.

421
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:44,287
Don't blame us if we can't find Rebecca.

422
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:45,663
We're doing everything.

423
00:27:45,747 --> 00:27:50,251
Well, what you're doing
is not enough, General Alejaga.

424
00:27:51,586 --> 00:27:54,631
Jericho's colleagues in the military
got ahead of you.

425
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,049
They already have a lead.

426
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,385
What lead?

427
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,097
Jericho didn't tell us,

428
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,767
but they already knew
where to find Ma'am Rebecca.

429
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,478
Well, if that's the case,
you no longer need my help.

430
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:10,980
General, wait.

431
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,112
Doc said you need to undergo

432
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:20,990
a pelvic exam, ultrasound,
and hysteroscopy,

433
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:26,746
so we can use it as proof in court
that you did get pregnant.

434
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,416
Yes.

435
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,084
I'll do that.

436
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,673
Yes, Jericho. I'll tell Rebecca.

437
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,384
Thank you, Attorney.

438
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:40,969
Doc, how are things going?
Is there a problem?

439
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:42,512
Why did Jericho talk to you?

440
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:45,014
There's something
you need to know, Rebecca.

441
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:46,975
Jericho asked me

442
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:48,810
if they could already talk
to you about that.

443
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,687
They?

444
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,064
Who are you talking about?

445
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,899
And what do I need to know?

446
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,318
They'll tell you once you see
each other face-to-face.

447
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,488
They are waiting for you now.

448
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,751
General Alejaga, I'm sorry I snapped.

449
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:15,754
I'm just too emotional now.

450
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,924
I'm scared that Jericho might get ahead
of us in finding Rebecca.

451
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:24,345
He and Sam might hide
or take Rebecca away from me.

452
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:27,974
Madam…

453
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:31,269
I just came from the mental facility.

454
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,938
They already know where Ma'am Rebecca is.

455
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,023
What?

456
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:38,234
Why didn't they tell me? Where is she?

457
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,653
She is in Saint Rafael Doctors' Hospital.

458
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:44,365
General Alejaga, thank you
so much for all your help,

459
00:29:44,449 --> 00:29:45,283
but I need to go.

460
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,202
Come with me.

461
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,832
Not now.

462
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,250
This is important.

463
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:56,795
<i>I followed Ms. Samantha.</i>

464
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,714
<i>She is now here</i>
<i>in the PAO office with Jericho.</i>

465
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,716
And Rebecca has arrived too.

466
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,009
What?

467
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,679
Jericho…

468
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,223
Rebecca.

469
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,683
- Jericho…
- Rebecca.

470
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,694
What are you going to tell me?

471
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:24,405
What do I need to know?

472
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:31,788
Sam?

473
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:35,333
She's the one you're with
who wants to talk to me?

474
00:30:35,416 --> 00:30:36,334
Why?

475
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,881
Rebecca…

476
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,349
Rebecca…

477
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,729
There's something you need to know.

478
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,318
We're sisters.

479
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,535
Wait, wait…

480
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,330
Jericho, what's this?

481
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,750
What is Sam saying? What's happening?

482
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,297
Sam is telling the truth.

483
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:24,549
You're not the daughter of Dad.

484
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,345
Your parents are Auntie Aurora
and Doc Orly.

485
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,644
Rebecca…

486
00:31:37,312 --> 00:31:40,231
Rebecca, I'm sorry
you had to find out this way.

487
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,151
But, we will explain everything to you,

488
00:31:44,986 --> 00:31:46,738
including the DNA results.

489
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:06,549
Vivian Trano was never found.

490
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:08,801
No traces.

491
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,970
It looks like they have been swept away
by the river into the sea.

492
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:13,806
How about the investigation
of the murder of Attorney Morales?

493
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,934
Is that connected with Ms.Trano?

494
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,435
No.

495
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:20,355
Even Juilet doesn't know Ms. Trano.

496
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,358
She may be working on her own,

497
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,736
keeping up with the chaos
happening in the Palacios.

498
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,656
So that means,

499
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:32,951
the mastermind Attorney Morales
told us is still at large.

500
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:34,619
Possibly.

501
00:32:35,662 --> 00:32:37,288
But, what I really think, Sarge,

502
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:42,835
is that the Palacios cases will never end
until we find the cause of the killing…

503
00:32:43,503 --> 00:32:45,546
the poisoning of Basil Palacios.

504
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,424
We should go back to the case.

505
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,684
I changed…

506
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:00,311
our DNA test result.

507
00:33:01,771 --> 00:33:05,066
I made it look…
like you are the daughter of Dad

508
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,904
because during that time,
Rebecca, you weren't stable yet.

509
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,031
I didn't want your condition to worsen.

510
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:18,913
I also didn't know
who your real parents were.

511
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:23,376
I asked Auntie Aurora, but she didn't say.

512
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:28,297
I indeed have Palacios blood
that came out in the DNA test result.

513
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,884
And that will also show
if we both take the DNA test.

514
00:33:32,593 --> 00:33:34,095
But, it also showed

515
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,973
that it's impossible
that Rebecca and I are siblings.

516
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,852
And that would only happen
if she has different parents.

517
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:44,313
The question is, who?

518
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,898
Ma'am Aurora…

519
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:49,068
Are you the real parent of Ma'am Rebecca?

520
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:55,074
How did you find out
that I'm her daughter?

521
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:58,536
I saw your birth certificate.

522
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,167
Rebecca, you were born in France.

523
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,671
And Dad and Mom Aurora declared

524
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,550
that they are your parents.

525
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:44,123
And when Mother was about
to confront Mom Aurora about this,

526
00:34:44,624 --> 00:34:48,461
she saw Uncle Galvan
forcing Aurora to confess.

527
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:52,757
And, Rebecca, she confessed everything.

528
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:55,635
She is your real mother.

529
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,595
Is Rebecca your daughter with Orly?

530
00:34:57,678 --> 00:34:58,554
Yes!

531
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:01,724
Orly and I have a child
and that's Rebecca.

532
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:02,642
<i>She confessed.</i>

533
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,144
She has a daughter with Orly
and it's Rebecca.

534
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:06,604
What?

535
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,232
So, I don't need a DNA Test.

536
00:35:11,859 --> 00:35:12,944
Wow.

537
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,863
Wow.

538
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:22,245
Auntie Aurora hid a lot
of secrets from me.

539
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,998
How could she do this to me?

540
00:35:26,791 --> 00:35:27,917
To us?

541
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,711
Rebecca…

542
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:36,843
- Sam…
- Rebecca…

543
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,431
Sam…

544
00:35:54,318 --> 00:35:57,155
Don't cry anymore, Sam.
Think about your baby.

545
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,782
Your baby, Sam.

546
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:07,957
I'm sorry.

547
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:11,085
I'm sorry, I failed to introduce
Attorney Lilet to both of you.

548
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,421
I wasn't able to tell you earlier.

549
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,384
The truth is I only asked her
to accompany me here

550
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,929
so we could talk about the case
I will file against Auntie Aurora.

551
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,099
Rebecca?

552
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:29,395
Rebecca, thank God.
You've been found and you're safe.

553
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,813
I was so worried.

554
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,065
I was so worried.

555
00:36:35,568 --> 00:36:38,237
That's enough.

556
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:40,656
I already know the truth.

557
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,327
I already know that I'm your daughter.

558
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,373
Rebecca, please forgive me.

559
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,710
Please let me explain, my child.

560
00:36:53,586 --> 00:36:56,505
Don't call me your child, Auntie Aurora.

561
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:59,091
I may have come from you,

562
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:03,721
but I can never accept
that you are my mother.

563
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:15,149
Thanks for your help
with the Francis Castillo case, Sarge.

564
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,278
If there's something I can do
to help find who poisoned Basil Palacios

565
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,948
and the mastermind of the
Palacios killings,

566
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,200
just tell me.

567
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,534
Okay, Sarge, thank you.

568
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,702
Okay.

569
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,932
I miss Ms. Vivian's voice.

570
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,769
Mom is noisy…

571
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,064
but since your mommy has been gone,
things are so quiet.

572
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:05,032
Even if I discovered
a lot of bad things about her,

573
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,702
I still miss her.

574
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:11,038
I still want her to be here.

575
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,957
Do you know why?

576
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,627
Because she was still a good mom to you.

577
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,339
You felt her love and care for you.

578
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:25,428
It's because she tried
to overcompensate Dad's absence.

579
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:30,057
Dad was too focused on Basil at that time.

580
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:36,439
But, when your life was in danger
with the Palacios killers,

581
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,401
I saw how worried your Dad was for you.

582
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,696
I saw how much he loves you.

583
00:38:44,864 --> 00:38:46,615
And now that your Mom is gone,

584
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,244
your Dad who will compensate for it.

585
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:16,562
Dad…

586
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:18,689
Sir Galvan…

587
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,863
Rico, call Dr. De los Reyes.

588
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,490
I need to talk to him

589
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,741
What for?

590
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,743
Will you stop me again?

591
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:33,287
Will you return me to the facility?

592
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,122
Will you stop me from looking
for my children?

593
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,333
You can't do that anymore
because I am well.

594
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:40,044
I don't believe you, Rebecca.

595
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,589
Rico, I said call Dr. De los Reyes, now!

596
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,174
No.

597
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,343
Dr. De los Reyes cleared her.

598
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:49,136
You can't take her back to the facility.

599
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,223
And who are you to decide that?

600
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:54,642
Are you her legal guardian?

601
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:59,397
You're not even her full-blooded sister.

602
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:03,734
It's still Rebecca
who will decide for herself.

603
00:40:04,944 --> 00:40:07,905
Oh my God, a little woman.

604
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:09,824
I didn't notice you.

605
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:11,409
And… wait…

606
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:17,456
Who are you to interrupt our conversation?

607
00:40:18,124 --> 00:40:19,834
She is Rebecca's legal counsel.

608
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:21,544
She is Attorney Lilet Matias.

609
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:25,631
Do you know
what you're talking about, small Attorney?

610
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:30,386
Rebecca is legally incapacitated
to decide for herself.

611
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:33,806
The two medical certificates
in my possession say different things.

612
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:39,395
Aside from the head psychiatrist
of the Saint Raphael Doctors' Hospital,

613
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:43,524
Dr. De los Reyes also gave
his medical assessment from the facility.

614
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:46,986
And according to both tests,
she is of sound mind.

615
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,491
Remind me again.

616
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,870
Who are you?

617
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,497
Why are you interfering
with our conversation?

618
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:04,420
I am Rebecca's legal counsel
for the case she will file against you.

619
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,172
Case?

620
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,883
You will sue me for taking Rebecca

621
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,760
to the mental facility
so she could be cured?

622
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,970
No.

623
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:16,974
I will sue you because of what
you did to me and my children.

624
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:19,351
Are you kidding me right now?

625
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,937
What are you talking about?

626
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,690
You're still going to deny it?

627
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:28,235
That you took away my children
and gave them to someone else.

628
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,571
I have nothing to deny, Rebecca.

629
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,574
What you're saying is all in your mind.

630
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,117
After you admitted to me

631
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,786
the truth after I saw Auntie
Hillary's letter

632
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:38,871
that she sent you.

633
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,375
<i>Hello, my darling Auro,</i>
<i>I just want to say thank you.</i>

634
00:41:43,876 --> 00:41:48,756
<i>You know, I wanted to kill myself</i>
<i>when I lost my baby with Alexander.</i>

635
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,424
<i>But you saved my life.</i>

636
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:54,386
<i>Thank you for letting me adopt</i>
<i>one of Rebecca's twins.</i>

637
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:00,851
What did I admit? What letter?

638
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,270
Stop it. Enough.

639
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:06,190
Stop lying and let's just
see each other in court.

640
00:42:19,245 --> 00:42:21,413
What if we go to Dr. Flores?

641
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,873
You're not needed in the hearing.

642
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,250
No. Rebecca needs me there.

643
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,918
She needs my support. I'm okay.

644
00:42:26,001 --> 00:42:27,711
Are you sure you're okay?

645
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,129
Sam…

646
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,173
Sam.

647
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,758
‪NEXT EPISODE

648
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:34,802
Give me back my children.

649
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,136
You're a demon. You're a liar.

650
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,514
Why did you take my children away from me?
Give them back.

651
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:40,683
Give me back my children!

652
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,476
Calm down.

653
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,812
You are being accused of kidnapping.

654
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:49,024
And the two children you kidnapped
are now with me and Barbara.

655
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:51,527
No one will know where the children are.

656
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:55,155
And besides, the court will
never listen to Rebecca.

657
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,783
<i>Sam will give birth next week, Kate.</i>

658
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:00,327
<i>Based on her symptoms</i>
<i>and the baby's position,</i>

659
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,538
she could give birth at any time.

660
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,081
What?

661
00:43:04,164 --> 00:43:06,166
So, I need to carry out my plan.

662
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:08,335
- As in any moment?
- Yes.

663
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,338
It looks like I will soon
see my baby Gilbert.
