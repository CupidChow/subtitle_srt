1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,724
Where am I?

2
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,642
Mother? Francis?

3
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:19,769
Aurora, I didn't have Sam abducted.

4
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,771
I'm giving you until tomorrow.

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,023
If you don't release Sam,

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,734
we'll end up killing each other.

7
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,402
Help me!

8
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:30,030
Hello, Sam. Did I scare you?

9
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:33,450
Why did you lock me here? You fool.

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:35,702
‪PREVIOUSLY

11
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,580
Check everything, and search
the area around the mansion, okay?

12
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,622
I need your help.

13
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,458
- What help?
- To find Sam in the mansion.

14
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:43,168
<i>It was Ma'am Aurora who had Sam abducted.</i>

15
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,044
It's George. She was attacked
by the Palacios killer.

16
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,505
Are you falling for George?

17
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:49,841
- What if I am, Bea?
- Aren't you gay?

18
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:51,801
I am not. Basil was.

19
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,303
<i>Jericho, Ma'am Aurora is on her way.</i>

20
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:00,268
You're a demon. Let me go.
Why did you lock me up here?

21
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:01,603
She's not here.

22
00:01:01,686 --> 00:01:03,229
But, how did it happen?
She hasn't come out yet.

23
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:04,814
- Could it be…
- There's a secret room?

24
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:08,568
You will be reunited with your husband.

25
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:11,279
- Paco is dead.
- Paco is alive.

26
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:12,989
Let me show you.

27
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,214
Here, what is this? Could this be it?

28
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:32,008
Wait. I remember something.

29
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:35,887
Cairo told me
that the mansion has a hidden tunnel.

30
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,807
Could that be the passageway there?

31
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:40,809
Let's see.

32
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:52,821
My son…

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,491
your wife is waiting.

34
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:01,830
Your wife is waiting.

35
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,265
Come on, Sam.

36
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,477
Is this how you greet
your dearly beloved husband?

37
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,355
Paco misses you so much.

38
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:29,274
Right, Paco?

39
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:42,328
Why-- Why is he here, Mom?

40
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,831
Surprised?

41
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,084
Why? What were you thinking, Samantha?

42
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:50,420
You thought that you would separate us

43
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,463
after pushing Paco off the cliff?

44
00:02:52,547 --> 00:02:53,840
Never.

45
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:57,176
You can't kill my son.

46
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,054
You can't take him away from me.

47
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,525
Jericho, here. There's a switch.

48
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,194
I'll do it.

49
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,616
Apologize to him.

50
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,786
Say sorry for what you did to my son.

51
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,746
Don't just stand there.

52
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:09,999
Go beg for his forgiveness.

53
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:16,047
Mom, don't shout at Sam. Look at her.

54
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,841
She's scared.

55
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,678
She should be scared, Paco.

56
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:24,180
She needs to pay for what she did to you.

57
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:27,308
Mom, I'm at peace now.

58
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,893
Well, I'm not.

59
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:31,229
She has to suffer, Paco.

60
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:33,189
Even though she is your wife,

61
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,775
I will make her suffer.

62
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:45,076
But, of course…

63
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,746
I won't kill her.

64
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:54,460
I just want her
to admit her sins and apologize.

65
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:59,048
Mom…

66
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:01,801
Paco is dead.

67
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:05,138
You're talking to the dead.

68
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,559
It's dark here.

69
00:05:53,227 --> 00:05:55,188
Where did Auntie Aurora go?

70
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,941
Maybe Sam is also here.

71
00:05:59,025 --> 00:05:59,984
Let's go.

72
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,207
Ouch.

73
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:15,291
Francis…

74
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:18,920
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

75
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,089
What's all of this?

76
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:24,634
TNT?

77
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:30,723
That's dynamite.

78
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,810
Most likely this is
what's used in the mine.

79
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,896
They deliver it here, and this is
where Auntie Aurora keeps it.

80
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,982
Why is it here inside the estate?
It's dangerous.

81
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,400
What do you mean dead?

82
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:44,153
What dead are you talking about, Samantha?

83
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,739
I'm sorry to break it to you.

84
00:06:47,406 --> 00:06:49,575
You didn't kill Paco.

85
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,871
He survived the fall.

86
00:06:54,956 --> 00:06:56,541
He is alive.

87
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,459
Come, take a look.

88
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:04,924
You don't want to?

89
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,719
Come here.

90
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:11,389
Come.

91
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,890
Look at your husband.

92
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,271
Why?

93
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,816
Why are you scared of him, Samantha?

94
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,986
Look at your husband.

95
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:29,532
Isn't he handsome?

96
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,830
He doesn't belong here.

97
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:38,541
Let's put his soul to rest.

98
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,460
Let him rest in peace.

99
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,336
Please, please.

100
00:07:45,047 --> 00:07:47,842
You cannot

101
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:52,346
take my son away from me, Samantha.

102
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:55,057
You tried it once.

103
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,394
I won't let you do that again.

104
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,771
Paco is mine.

105
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,440
My son is mine only.

106
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,957
Help me!

107
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,753
That's Sam.

108
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:26,047
Let's go.

109
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,343
- Help me.
- What are you doing?

110
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,261
Come here. Come here.

111
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,262
Stay here.

112
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,682
Here.

113
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:50,655
Francis, there. There's light there.

114
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:52,740
There's a light. Let's go.

115
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,090
Sam. Sam.

116
00:09:09,173 --> 00:09:10,550
- Ma'am Sam. Ma'am Sam.
- Sam.

117
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,052
- Just stay there.
- Francis.

118
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:15,012
- Francis. Help me.
- No. No.

119
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,431
Francis. Francis, help me.

120
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,017
- Here, Ma'am Sam.
- Sam. Sam.

121
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:21,644
Francis!

122
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,354
- Sam.
- Samantha.

123
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,190
- No one can save you now.
- Sam.

124
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:27,900
You're crazy.

125
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:29,652
Let me go. Francis!

126
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:31,070
- Francis, help me.
- Sam.

127
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,281
- Ma'am Sam.
- Jericho, here.

128
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,745
- Sam. Sam.
- Ma'am Sam.

129
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:40,663
- Francis. Francis.
- Sam.

130
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:43,082
Ma'am Aurora, let my sister go.

131
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,166
- Sam.
- It's Paco.

132
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,670
Why is his corpse here? He's dead, right?

133
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,800
You made him taxidermy?

134
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,510
Let's go. Let's go.

135
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:56,470
- Come on.
- Sam, let's go.

136
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:59,223
Where are you going?
No, you're not leaving here.

137
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,808
Let go of my sister.
Stop bothering my sister.

138
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,518
- Francis, don't. Francis.
- Stop bothering my sister.

139
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,562
Francis, let's go.

140
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,355
Come on, Sam.

141
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,610
Why is Paco's corpse here?
He is dead, right?

142
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,779
That's none of your business.

143
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,782
Get out, Jericho. Get out.

144
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,660
I said get out. Get out.

145
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,454
Get out of here.

146
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,206
Get out. Get out.

147
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,666
Sam, this way.

148
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,752
Here. This way. Let's hurry up.

149
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:40,139
Paco…

150
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,183
are you okay?

151
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,435
Are you sure you're okay?

152
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,363
Ma'am, relax first.

153
00:10:55,446 --> 00:10:57,657
We will find Ma'am Sam.

154
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,622
- Mother.
- Mother. Mother. Mother.

155
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,540
- Mother.
- Sam.

156
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,710
Sam, you're safe.

157
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:10,878
Who abducted you?

158
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,296
It's Aurora.

159
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,798
And Paco.

160
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,550
Mother, she preserved Paco.

161
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:17,885
What?

162
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:20,805
Mother, she's hiding Paco's corpse.

163
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,475
But, Paco was cremated, wasn't he?

164
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,852
No, Mother. That was all for show.

165
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,151
Now it all makes sense.

166
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,237
That's why I saw her carrying wine

167
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,155
for two people.

168
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:48,707
<i>Well, I saw you carrying</i>
<i>two wine glasses earlier.</i>

169
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,419
Who were you drinking with?

170
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:56,257
Paco.

171
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,347
She wasn't lying, Mother.

172
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,433
She is really visiting Paco.

173
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,685
She thinks Paco is still alive.

174
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,895
What?

175
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,189
Sam, I think your mother-in-law is
going crazy.

176
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:14,191
She's been thinking
about a lot of nonsense.

177
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,445
Let's get out of here, Sam.

178
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,655
Aurora might do something else to you.

179
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,073
That's right, Sam. Let's leave.

180
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,243
But, what about Paco?

181
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,454
Are we leaving him?

182
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,831
What do you want to do, Sam?

183
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,003
He is my husband.

184
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:37,214
His soul will not be at peace
as long as he is there.

185
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:39,300
But, Sam. Do you think Ma'am Aurora

186
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,177
will let you bury Paco?

187
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,970
She hid her son's corpse.

188
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,430
She has gone crazy, Sam.

189
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,348
Whatever we tell her,

190
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,058
she will never accept it.

191
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,480
From now on, Iñigo is not
allowed to enter the estate.

192
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,773
But, Dad.

193
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,818
Even if someone begs to let him in,

194
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,737
do not let that man in.

195
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,030
Do you understand?

196
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,490
Yes, sir.

197
00:13:02,573 --> 00:13:03,824
You may go.

198
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,162
Sam…

199
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,623
Your brother is right. I understand you.

200
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,459
I know you love Paco,

201
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:16,670
but you don't stand a chance
against Ma'am Aurora.

202
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,006
Think about your safety first.

203
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:20,466
Let's leave this place.

204
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,135
- Let's go, Sam.
- Let's go.

205
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,847
Where the hell do you think you're going?

206
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,561
We're not done yet, Samantha.

207
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,355
You are not leaving.

208
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,070
Dad…

209
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,156
whatever Iñigo's fault was before,

210
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,575
I'm sure he regrets it now.

211
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:47,993
He already made it up to Basil

212
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,078
by being a good friend.

213
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,454
Friend?

214
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:53,123
Please, George.

215
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,875
That man is poison.

216
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,377
He poisoned Basil

217
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,213
with all his lies and immorality.

218
00:13:59,296 --> 00:14:00,256
That is why as early as now,

219
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,508
I'm taking you and my grandchild
away from him.

220
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,134
Sir Galvan…

221
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:06,220
there's trouble in the other house.

222
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,222
Again?

223
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,100
Ma'am Aurora hid Sir Paco's dead body

224
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:13,018
in her house.

225
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:15,271
What?

226
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,439
You are not leaving my house.

227
00:14:17,523 --> 00:14:19,024
We are leaving.

228
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:21,068
Don't dare me, Sam.

229
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,695
You stay here until you give birth,

230
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,697
- or else…
- Or else what?

231
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,116
What hold do you have over my sister?

232
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,952
What do you mean by Paco's dead body?

233
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,204
Paco was cremated, wasn't he?

234
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:35,374
That's what Rico said.

235
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,586
Ms. Sam saw Sir Paco's corpse.

236
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,715
She has really lost her mind.

237
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:46,594
Sam just invented that
so we are distracted

238
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,304
and forget that she pushed her own husband

239
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,389
off the cliff.

240
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,892
Wasn't Paco cremated

241
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,853
after he was declared dead
in the hospital?

242
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,897
Yes, Dad.

243
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,900
So, no one saw Paco's corpse.

244
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:06,280
She pushed my son off the cliff.

245
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:10,826
She needs to suffer
and pay for what she did.

246
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,077
Well, you too.

247
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,330
You'll also pay for your sins.

248
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,373
You locked Sam up. That's kidnapping.

249
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,959
We will report you
to the police and you will be jailed.

250
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:20,628
Go ahead.

251
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:24,089
Let's sue each other. I am not scared.

252
00:15:24,173 --> 00:15:26,216
But, I'm warning you…

253
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,387
Many tried to take me down,
and none of them won.

254
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,473
There's always a first time.

255
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:35,935
I will not stay here.
We will not stay in this house.

256
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:37,478
You're going crazy.

257
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:38,479
You're crazy.

258
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,862
I hope you've given all your strength…

259
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:51,200
because that's the last time
you will hurt me.

260
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,494
Let's go.

261
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,912
We're not done yet.

262
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,667
We are done.

263
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,816
Don't tell me you believe it, Dad?

264
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,944
That's absurd. Beyond absurd.

265
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:28,779
Crazy even.

266
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:32,783
You don't know Aurora, George.

267
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:36,036
Even when we were kids, she did a lot of…

268
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:42,418
Just like what you said, beyond absurd.

269
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:46,380
But, why would she do that to her own son?

270
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:49,508
Why would she hide Paco's corpse?

271
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,152
Parent's love…

272
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,488
knows no logic.

273
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:19,955
George, when you give birth,
you'll understand.

274
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:24,376
Maybe you might do more
for your child than what Aurora did.

275
00:17:30,924 --> 00:17:32,760
Rest first, Paco.

276
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:37,389
Don't think about Sam's threat.

277
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:39,475
I am not afraid of her.

278
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,443
So, it's true.

279
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,572
You hid your son here.

280
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,283
How did you know, Galvan?

281
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:57,618
Oh, God…

282
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,286
It was Sam.

283
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,913
That despicable woman.

284
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,748
Don't blame Sam.

285
00:18:02,831 --> 00:18:05,250
We all know your secret, Aurora.

286
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:08,045
Oh, please, Galvan. Just leave me alone.

287
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,591
Are you out of your mind?

288
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,427
You made your son taxidermy?

289
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:20,140
I don't want to lose him, Galvan.

290
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,103
I wanted to be with my son.

291
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,606
All day, every day
for the rest of our lives.

292
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:32,194
Is that crazy, Galvan?

293
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,573
How selfish of you.

294
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:39,326
I wanted you to preserve Basil,
but you didn't agree.

295
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:42,287
But, it turns out
that you did it to your son.

296
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,916
Sarge, you should arrest Ma'am Aurora.

297
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,501
She kidnapped my sister.

298
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,753
Is that true?

299
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,589
Ma'am Aurora locked up Ma'am Sam.

300
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:53,966
She is crazy.

301
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,136
Only a crazy person would do what she did.

302
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:58,929
No wonder…

303
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,431
No wonder she was in a hurry
to cremate my husband's body

304
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:03,892
because she preserved it. She hid it.

305
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,110
I asked you before when Basil died

306
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:15,529
to preserve him.

307
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,782
I begged you

308
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:21,368
to make him taxidermy.

309
00:19:21,451 --> 00:19:22,661
Preserve my son.

310
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:24,329
Preserve? How?

311
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,332
Preserve my son,
just like your taxidermies.

312
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,834
Please.

313
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,211
- Please, I'm begging you.
- No, no.

314
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:32,796
- Please.
- I won't do that.

315
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,257
Please, preserve my son.

316
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:38,051
- I won't do that.
- Preserve him, please.

317
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:40,053
But, what did you do?

318
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,388
You rejected me.

319
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:44,558
Because I don't want anyone
to know what I'm capable of doing.

320
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,643
Just say you're selfish.

321
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,145
You want to be the only one who is happy.

322
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:51,148
You want for you
to be the only one to be with your son.

323
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:52,983
But, what about me?

324
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,985
I wanted my son to be with me.

325
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:00,699
I'm sorry, Galvan.

326
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:05,120
Even if I wanted to help you now,

327
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,538
it's too late.

328
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:08,832
Basil's body is already rotting,

329
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:11,585
unlike my son, Paco, here. Look at him.

330
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,129
No!

331
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,465
- You're unfair.
- No.

332
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:17,841
- Sir Galvan.
- You're so unfair.

333
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,426
Sir Galvan, Ma'am Aurora.

334
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,136
Stop fighting.

335
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,180
- What?
- You too.

336
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:24,932
Her great accomplice.

337
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,229
Wait…

338
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:31,730
That's prohibited.

339
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,357
You can't hide a dead body.

340
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,859
Especially in a residential area.

341
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,444
That's harmful to people.

342
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,696
She thinks Paco is alive.

343
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,782
I saw her talking to him.

344
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,077
She's talking to him.
She thinks Paco is replying to her.

345
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,079
She doesn't only need the police.
She needs a doctor.

346
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,039
She should be taken to a mental facility.

347
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,250
Where is Mrs. Palacios?

348
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,918
She's inside.

349
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,880
- Okay, I'll take care of it.
- Sarge, arrest her.

350
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,135
You've known about this
for a long time, haven't you?

351
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:04,012
And you didn't even tell me.

352
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,268
I promised Ma'am Aurora

353
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:11,061
that I would not tell anyone.

354
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,399
I will do everything for you.

355
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:17,818
I will give you everything, Paco.

356
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,905
Son, please wake up.

357
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,115
Please…

358
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,911
Please wake up, Paco.

359
00:21:36,503 --> 00:21:38,088
Help me.

360
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:47,055
Paco, my son. You're alive.

361
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:52,102
Say something. Say something, please.
Say something.

362
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,230
I will do everything.

363
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:57,691
I will do everything.

364
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:59,860
From now on,

365
00:21:59,943 --> 00:22:00,986
no one…

366
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,613
as in no one,

367
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:07,326
will ever harm you again.

368
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,618
No one.

369
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,204
Can you hear me?

370
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,290
My God.

371
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,043
Amando. Amando.

372
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,212
He's alive.

373
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:20,922
Paco is alive. He is alive.

374
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,341
Look at him. He's alive.

375
00:22:22,424 --> 00:22:25,844
My son is alive. Paco…

376
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,264
Oh, my God.

377
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,267
Can you see that he is alive? Look.

378
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,394
He is very much alive.

379
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,318
Why are you not moving?

380
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:43,153
Why are you just standing there?

381
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:44,488
Help me.

382
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,947
Let's carry my son.

383
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,492
He's alive, Amando.

384
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:52,913
No one… No one can know
that he is alive, Amando. Okay?

385
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,042
No one can know that my son is alive.

386
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:59,795
My God. He's alive, Amando. Look at him.

387
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,592
My God, look at my son.

388
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,552
He's alive.

389
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,847
My Paco, my son. I love you so much.

390
00:23:16,853 --> 00:23:19,272
Just say you're tolerating her.

391
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,024
Galvan, stop it.

392
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:23,401
That's enough. What's with you?

393
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:25,570
Stop picking on Amando.

394
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,782
He's just following my orders.

395
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,909
He's the only one I trust.

396
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:35,330
And no one was supposed
to know about this.

397
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:40,669
Hold on… Does she need
to be arrested right away?

398
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:44,005
Can we just reprimand her or talk to her?

399
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,508
What?

400
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,969
Hold on. I thought you were on our side?

401
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,220
Why does it seem
like you're changing your mind?

402
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:51,972
She is still my family.

403
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:53,849
If she has a mental problem,

404
00:23:53,932 --> 00:23:55,433
what she needs is a doctor,

405
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:57,686
not the police or jail.

406
00:23:58,478 --> 00:23:59,855
It's too late.

407
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,400
Sam has already reported it to the police.

408
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,443
Sergeant Royales is already outside.

409
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:14,494
That woman is really a traitor.

410
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,211
Paco…

411
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,806
Jericho, I don't want Mom
to get into trouble either.

412
00:24:35,473 --> 00:24:37,517
She's the grandmother of my baby.

413
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,686
But, enough is enough.

414
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:41,980
Her craziness has to stop.

415
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,148
Jericho…

416
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,316
she's crazy.

417
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,026
We don't know what she could do.

418
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,110
She could hurt me,

419
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,196
or my baby.

420
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,157
My baby is also part of your family.

421
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,785
Do you want her to hurt my baby?

422
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,376
Amando, you can leave us now.

423
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,045
But, madam--

424
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,796
I can manage.

425
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,090
I can answer all the questions

426
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:11,885
from Sergeant Royales all by myself.

427
00:25:11,968 --> 00:25:13,637
Thank you, Amando.

428
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:33,114
I supposed you're here to ask questions

429
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,742
about my son, Detective.

430
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,870
But, as far as I know, Detective,

431
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,331
there's no law saying

432
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,750
that I can't make my son, Paco, taxidermy.

433
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,669
And don't worry.

434
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,463
He is not a health hazard.

435
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:51,007
He is properly preserved.

436
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,511
If you didn't have your son cremated,

437
00:25:54,594 --> 00:25:56,471
who owns the ashes in your shrine?

438
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:05,814
Are you leaving?

439
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:09,567
Isn't it obvious?

440
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,112
We're leaving now.

441
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,780
The people living here are crazy.

442
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:15,949
Is the news true…

443
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:17,867
that Paco's corpse is still here?

444
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,494
Did you see it?

445
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:20,704
What does it look like?

446
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,045
The ashes…?

447
00:26:30,171 --> 00:26:32,716
It was just an old piece
of wood, Detective.

448
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,384
My gosh.

449
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:38,346
So, it's more important to you…

450
00:26:39,639 --> 00:26:41,850
for everybody to know
that you had Paco cremated?

451
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,562
Is that a crime, Detective?

452
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,981
What difference does it make

453
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:52,277
if my son Paco was cremated
or made into taxidermy?

454
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:04,122
The real crime is
that Sam pushed my son down the cliff.

455
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,875
You should be investigating her, not me.

456
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:11,171
This is not about Sam and Paco Palacios.

457
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:12,839
Mom…

458
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,341
I'm just curious.

459
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,134
Can we just take a look?

460
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,139
If I were you, I'd leave too.

461
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,893
Especially you, George,
as you are pregnant.

462
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:26,811
Your child is more important

463
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,022
than being a queen here
on the Palacios estate.

464
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,077
What I'm investigating here,
Mrs. Palacios,

465
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,996
is why you are hiding his corpse?

466
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,165
And if you are hiding something else.

467
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:48,958
Do you have a child, Detective?

468
00:27:49,709 --> 00:27:50,794
No.

469
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:54,381
Then you have no right
to ask me those questions.

470
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,681
You will never understand.

471
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:08,478
You will never know the bond
between a mother and her son.

472
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:09,896
Is that why, up till now,

473
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,148
you can't accept that Paco is dead?

474
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,733
What?

475
00:28:21,616 --> 00:28:24,327
Mrs. Palacios, is it true
that you're talking to your son?

476
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,453
Is that true?

477
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,853
Who told you that?

478
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,064
Answer my question, Mrs. Palacios.

479
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:56,359
I was told that you're talking to Paco.

480
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:58,403
Of course not.

481
00:28:58,486 --> 00:28:59,863
Never?

482
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:01,698
Not even once?

483
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:04,325
Sergeant Royales…

484
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:06,453
what are you implying?

485
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,706
That I am crazy? That I am insane?

486
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:10,999
God.

487
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,084
I am just grieving, Detective.

488
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,544
I lost my son.

489
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,839
Who is spreading that? Sam?

490
00:29:20,425 --> 00:29:23,011
I am not crazy, Detective.

491
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:24,429
I'm not crazy.

492
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,515
So, Ms. Samantha is lying?

493
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:30,894
She is a pathological liar.

494
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,897
How many times did
you catch her lying, Detective?

495
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:37,442
Didn't she make us all believe…

496
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,861
that Paco fell and was not pushed?

497
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,738
She acts very well.

498
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,575
She pretends to be a saint.
Don't believe her.

499
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,963
What's that smell?

500
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,720
It smells like something is burning.

501
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,314
If you want to leave, then just go.

502
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,732
Nobody's stopping you.

503
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,858
Don't involve us.

504
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,486
I'm just concerned about you.

505
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:23,446
If you don't want
to listen, that's up to you.

506
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,198
- Let's go.
- Let's go. Come on, let's hurry.

507
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,866
Hurry up. Let's go.

508
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,368
- Come on. Hurry up.
- What's happening?

509
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,869
- There's a fire.
- Let's go.

510
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,412
- Come on. Let's go.
- Let's go.

511
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,664
Don't take the car. It might catch fire.

512
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:34,415
Let's go. Get out of here.

513
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:35,875
Go there. It's much safer there.

514
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:37,460
- Let's go.
- Ma'am George, let's go.

515
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:38,753
Hurry. Hurry up.

516
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,213
Let's go.

517
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,014
- Mrs. Palacios, let's get out.
- No.

518
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,433
No, my house can't burn down.

519
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,435
We need to put it out, Detective.

520
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:55,937
With the size of your house,

521
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,355
we don't know
where the fire is coming from.

522
00:30:57,438 --> 00:30:58,815
Let's go, Mrs. Palacios.
It's dangerous here.

523
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,775
No. Let go of me.

524
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,236
My son, Paco…

525
00:31:07,448 --> 00:31:08,575
Yes, fire station.

526
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:12,328
Yes. There's fire here at Palacios Estate.

527
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,585
Okay.

528
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:20,670
Mrs. Palacios…

529
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,008
Mrs. Palacios?

530
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:27,343
Mrs. Palacios.

531
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,769
Let's go there.

532
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:38,855
- What's happening?
- Mother, be careful.

533
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:43,651
Let's stay here, Ma'am. Be careful.

534
00:31:48,323 --> 00:31:50,742
- Stay here.
- Be careful.

535
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:29,489
What happened?
Where did the fire come from?

536
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:30,782
We don't know.

537
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:31,950
It suddenly caught fire.

538
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,201
We just ran.

539
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,413
Could it be that Sam did it?

540
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:41,334
Remember when their house was
also burned down?

541
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:43,544
And that was the start of our suffering.

542
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,588
I can hear you.

543
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:47,966
Why are you blaming someone right away?

544
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:50,176
It's like you were in a hurry to leave.

545
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,261
- That's why maybe…
- Maybe what?

546
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,013
Why are you so defensive now?

547
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,890
You're so guilty.

548
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,351
Sam, stop it.

549
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,228
You too, Ruth. Stop it.

550
00:33:14,867 --> 00:33:16,035
Sam…

551
00:33:23,209 --> 00:33:24,210
Are you okay?

552
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,670
I don't know. How about you? Are you okay?

553
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,255
Sam. Sam.

554
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,716
I'm fine. I was just surprised.

555
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,843
Mom. Mom.

556
00:33:32,552 --> 00:33:33,845
- Sam, let's go.
- Sam.

557
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:35,304
- Mom…
- Sam.

558
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,640
Let's go, Sam.

559
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,812
Are you okay?

560
00:33:43,312 --> 00:33:44,355
Yes, I'm okay.

561
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,525
Sarge…

562
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,278
- Sarge, good thing you're safe.
- There's a problem.

563
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:51,988
It's Mrs. Palacios. She was left inside.

564
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,282
- What?
- Oh, my God.

565
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:57,326
Where are the firemen?
Did someone call the firemen?

566
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,704
I already called them.
They're on their way.

567
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:01,039
That will take a long time.

568
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,707
The fire station is far from here.

569
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,751
What about Ma'am Aurora?

570
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:10,923
Let me do it. I will go back there.

571
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,800
Ma'am Aurora.

572
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:15,053
Ma'am Aurora.

573
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:25,521
Sir Galvan, have you seen Ma'am Aurora?
I've been looking for her.

574
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,899
Weren't you with her?

575
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,819
She asked me to leave
when she talked to Sergeant Royales.

576
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:34,363
I think she was left inside.

577
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,282
Let's go back for her.

578
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,702
Are you crazy?

579
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,245
The fire is too big.

580
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,332
Jericho, it's too dangerous.

581
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,209
Let's just wait for the firemen.

582
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:49,378
Nothing will happen if I just stand here.

583
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,464
I need to go back for Ma'am Aurora now.

584
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,132
Are you sure?

585
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:55,176
You would risk your life for that woman?

586
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,011
She is still my family.

587
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,471
Even though she doesn't accept you?

588
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:00,181
Is that important?

589
00:35:01,516 --> 00:35:02,767
She lost her son.

590
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,812
Rebecca is also gone.

591
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:07,522
I'm the only one she can count on.

592
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,148
Wait, Jericho.

593
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,528
Just stay here, sir.

594
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:17,073
I will look for your sister.

595
00:35:19,909 --> 00:35:21,285
Ma'am Aurora.

596
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:23,454
Galvan.

597
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:28,376
We are still family no matter
how dysfunctional we are.

598
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:33,047
We're family. We're blood relatives.

599
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,010
Even when families fight,

600
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:40,138
they protect each other,

601
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:44,559
love each other,

602
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,978
and don't kill each other.

603
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,781
The firemen are on their way.

604
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:02,243
I'm still worried for Mom.

605
00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:04,787
Even though I'm mad at her,
I still don't want her to be in danger.

606
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:06,205
I know that.

607
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:12,753
Be careful, sir.

608
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,731
Sir Galvan is here.

609
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,357
- Dad…
- Yes, he's here.

610
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:34,984
- Sir…
- Sir.

611
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:37,111
It's Dad.

612
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,659
What happened?

613
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,703
- Where's Aurora?
- Sir Galvan…

614
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:49,332
Dad, what happened?

615
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:53,252
The ceiling fell on him
while he was looking for Ma'am Aurora.

616
00:36:54,295 --> 00:36:56,297
Mom? Where is Mom?

617
00:36:57,757 --> 00:37:00,009
We can't find her.

618
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,261
The fire is too big.

619
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,621
Be careful.

620
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,373
It's Aurora.

621
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,125
She's here.

622
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:36,837
- Aurora… Aurora…
- Ma'am Aurora…

623
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,509
- Aurora…
- Aurora…

624
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,011
Mom…

625
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,270
My son, Paco. Where is he?

626
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:53,896
Where's my son, Sam?

627
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,107
Galvan, where is Paco? Where is Paco?

628
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,817
Where is Paco? Where is my son?

629
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,860
Sam, where is Paco?

630
00:38:00,569 --> 00:38:02,613
Where is my son?

631
00:38:06,242 --> 00:38:08,953
Paco!

632
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:11,789
- Madam…
- My son.

633
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,583
Aurora…

634
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,168
That's enough.

635
00:38:16,252 --> 00:38:18,296
Paco.

636
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,630
That's enough.

637
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,758
It's too late. It's too late.

638
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,266
Galvan.

639
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,179
The fire started near Paco's body.

640
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,765
The mansion was burned down
to eliminate all the evidence

641
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,684
of Basil, Beverly, and Peter's deaths.

642
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,186
Did the serial killer burn it?

643
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:16,729
Yes, who else?

644
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,357
If you really don't want to accept me,

645
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,609
I will agree.

646
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:24,487
I will agree to this kind of setup for us.

647
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,074
But, please let me serve you.

648
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,951
Let me be your guide and support.

649
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:33,746
Sam is really brave, George, isn't she?

650
00:39:33,829 --> 00:39:36,916
She's already standing up
to being a killer.

651
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:40,044
That's why she's acting like a queen.

652
00:39:40,127 --> 00:39:43,422
Yes, Mom. She's really going
to be a queen…

653
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,799
in the city jail.

654
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,884
Do you also have something like that?

655
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:50,429
It's because my doctor
used to always wear that.

656
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,515
Who is your doctor?

657
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:53,599
Dr. Orly.

658
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,226
Belen.

659
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:56,977
Mom, is that you?

660
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:57,895
‪NEXT EPISODE

661
00:39:58,479 --> 00:39:59,480
Mom?
