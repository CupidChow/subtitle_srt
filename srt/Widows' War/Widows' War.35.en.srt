1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,725
You will help
Sergeant Royales investigation?

2
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:19,144
They are my family, Rico.
I want to protect them.

3
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:22,355
And that will only happen
if they catch that Palacios killer.

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:23,898
George, don't say anything yet.

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,233
What the hell are you doing here?

6
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:27,235
I'm here to represent George.

7
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,070
Did I get pregnant? Did I have babies?

8
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:30,405
No, Rebecca.

9
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:33,783
Then why did a nurse
from the hospital ask me about my twins?

10
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,619
<i>Then why am I hearing those babies crying?</i>

11
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,873
I don't know. You always hear things.

12
00:00:40,457 --> 00:00:43,376
- Did I have babies? Did I get pregnant?
- Rebecca, no.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,003
- Stop saying that.
- Oh, please tell me.

14
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:46,921
- Did I get pregnant?
- Get her. Take her back to her room.

15
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:48,339
- Did I have babies?
- Now.

16
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:49,591
No. Please tell me.

17
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:52,969
<i>How's my dear daughter-in-law?</i>

18
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:59,392
My suspicion before was right.
You pushed Paco off the cliff.

19
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:01,811
Mom, I don't know
what you're talking about.

20
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:06,107
You had an umbrella with you
the night Paco fell off the cliff.

21
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:09,194
You used that umbrella to push him.

22
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:12,864
That's why your footprints were
far from the cliff.

23
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,159
Why are you still here?

24
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:18,369
Dad, what's your problem with Iñigo?

25
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:21,790
<i>You haven't told this woman</i>
<i>why I don't want you?</i>

26
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,291
All right, Mr. Palacios.

27
00:01:23,374 --> 00:01:25,001
<i>You're not going to see me here again.</i>

28
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:27,879
You can tell me.
Whatever that is, it's safe with me.

29
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,548
I will eventually tell you, but not now.

30
00:01:30,632 --> 00:01:32,926
Mother, Sam, come on.
Let's get out of here.

31
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:34,677
Where do you think you're going?

32
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,264
One more step

33
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,810
and the next shot
will go through one of you.

34
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:45,355
Don't believe her. Come. get inside, Sam.

35
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,317
- Francis. Francis…
- Francis. Francis…

36
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:53,279
No Castillo will leave
the Palacios estate.

37
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,075
Both of you, get them
and bring them inside my house.

38
00:01:57,158 --> 00:01:59,119
Go. Now!

39
00:02:00,161 --> 00:02:03,414
Amando, talk to the security guards.

40
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:09,337
Tell them that if
any Castillo attempts to leave here…

41
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,885
shoot them all.

42
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:17,595
Yes, madam.

43
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,407
She denied it, Jericho.

44
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:42,704
Auntie Aurora denied
that I got pregnant and had babies.

45
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:47,375
Maybe she's telling the truth.

46
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:53,756
I feel something different.

47
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,886
I can feel it in my heart
that I have children.

48
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,029
George.

49
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,951
Have you talked to Sergeant Royales yet?

50
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,994
Yes.

51
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:25,246
So, are you acquitted now?

52
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:30,293
I can't say,
but even if they talk to me several times,

53
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,129
they can't prove
that I am the Palacios killer

54
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,797
because I'm innocent.

55
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:35,965
Of course, George.

56
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:38,384
But, you know, there's a latest rumor.

57
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,637
The issue about Paco came alive again.

58
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,513
Yes, Mother.

59
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,641
According to Cairo,

60
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:47,352
Ma'am Aurora is accusing Sam

61
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:50,230
because it was her
who pushed Paco using an umbrella.

62
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,023
What?

63
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,614
Calm down.

64
00:04:01,532 --> 00:04:03,743
I will help you find the truth.

65
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:04,661
But, how?

66
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,288
If Auntie Aurora refuses
to tell the truth,

67
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:09,832
do you think Uncle Galvan
would do it for me?

68
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,750
Of course not.

69
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,920
How about the nurse in the hospital?

70
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,589
I didn't get her name.

71
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:18,508
How about her face?

72
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,760
Can you recognize her face
if you see her again?

73
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,512
Yes.

74
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:23,888
Let's look for her.

75
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:30,770
George…

76
00:04:32,605 --> 00:04:34,357
I want you to replace your lawyer.

77
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,734
Why, Dad?

78
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,112
To ruin my defense?

79
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,532
So you can pin me down more
with your accusations against me?

80
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:43,783
I'm sorry, but no.

81
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,994
Just do as I say.

82
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,664
Get a different lawyer.

83
00:04:49,747 --> 00:04:51,082
No matter who, no matter how many,

84
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:52,542
I don't care,

85
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:53,626
as long as it's not Iñigo.

86
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,131
I don't want you
to have anything to do with that man

87
00:04:58,214 --> 00:04:59,966
or anyone from this family.

88
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:01,259
Family?

89
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,653
<i>You're an animal, Aurora. You hurt Sam.</i>

90
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:22,488
<i>You hurt Mother.</i>

91
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:23,906
<i>And you shot me.</i>

92
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,345
Detective…

93
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,141
What do you need, Ma'am Aurora?

94
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,145
I want to reopen Paco's case.

95
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,566
Did I hear that right, Dad? Family?

96
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:01,944
After you pinned me down,
I am still your family?

97
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:04,030
Do I have a choice?

98
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:06,991
You're forcing yourself here.

99
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:08,910
You are right.

100
00:06:08,993 --> 00:06:10,328
You don't have a choice,

101
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,414
but it's not because I am
forcing myself here.

102
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:16,000
It's because I am still your son's wife.

103
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,003
And Palacios is my last name.

104
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:20,963
Get out.

105
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,216
Get out of my house.

106
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,258
- Dad?
- Get out of my house.

107
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:25,468
- Dad, let go of me.
- Sir Galvan.

108
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,928
- Get out.
- Sir Galvan, don't.

109
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,554
- Get out of my house.
- Let go of George.

110
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:31,182
- Get out of my house.
- Dad. Stop it.

111
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:35,144
My son did not commit suicide.
He was pushed.

112
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,565
Ma'am, Sergeant Casas already
explained that to you.

113
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,151
That it was not feasible to push Paco.

114
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,903
It was Sam.

115
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,573
She used an umbrella
to push my son off the cliff.

116
00:06:48,616 --> 00:06:51,577
With all the people who investigated,
they didn't think about it.

117
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:52,912
I was right.

118
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,581
Sergeant Casas is useless.

119
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,794
I hope you're not like him,
Sergeant Royales.

120
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:00,920
I'm not.

121
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,964
Then prove it.

122
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:04,757
Arrest Sam.

123
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,554
- Dad, stop it.
- Let go, you're hurting her.

124
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,639
My son is gone. Basil is gone.

125
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:13,433
You are bringing nothing but trouble here.

126
00:07:13,516 --> 00:07:14,684
- Sir Galvan. Sir Galvan.
- Get out.

127
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,144
- Stop it.
- I don't want to see all of you here.

128
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,770
George is pregnant.

129
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:26,237
What?

130
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:27,905
Yes.

131
00:07:27,989 --> 00:07:30,867
That's what the doctor said yesterday.

132
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:36,706
George, is that true?

133
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,006
Just a second, detective.

134
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:47,884
Who's there?

135
00:08:00,104 --> 00:08:02,440
You know what's true, Dad?

136
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,151
That Basil is already dead.

137
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:07,778
My husband is already dead.

138
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,699
That's why there's no reason
for me, for us,

139
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:13,284
to stay in your house.

140
00:08:15,036 --> 00:08:16,287
Mom, Ward, let's go.

141
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,705
- We're leaving this house.
- Wait…

142
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,748
Wait, George.

143
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,708
Wait, George.

144
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,096
George is pregnant.

145
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,476
I'm going to be a grandfather.

146
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,242
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- What are you doing there?

147
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,285
I'm going to Ma'am Rebecca's room

148
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,621
to change the bedsheets.

149
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:00,456
Go.

150
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:06,546
Detective, let's talk in my office.

151
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,769
Congratulations, Dad.

152
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,188
You're going to be a grandfather.

153
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,482
I'm looking forward
to being a grandfather.

154
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:28,568
Wow, grandfather.

155
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,444
Who's going to be a grandfather?

156
00:09:31,529 --> 00:09:33,281
George is pregnant.

157
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:39,662
No, that can't be.

158
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,622
What do you mean that can't be?

159
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:45,126
But, isn't she barren?

160
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:46,836
That's not what the doctor said

161
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:50,131
when she was rushed to the hospital.

162
00:09:50,798 --> 00:09:52,383
George is pregnant.

163
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:54,760
Really?

164
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,679
Who's the father?

165
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:59,724
Mom, of course, it's Basil.

166
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,311
Are we sure about that?

167
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,658
Sam, your mother-in-law
wants you arrested.

168
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:19,702
What?

169
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:21,704
She has no basis.

170
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:24,415
She can't put me in jail.
There's a process.

171
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,292
Sam, let's not take a risk.

172
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,335
Let's get out of here.

173
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:31,881
Francis, do you think
we can get out of this estate?

174
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,341
Yes, Sam.

175
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,093
I already talked to Ronnie
the gardener. I'm friends with.

176
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,513
There's a gate at the back
of the estate for the staff.

177
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:40,848
We will sneak out from there.

178
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,894
Oh, my. Galvan, there you go again.

179
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,105
You always believe.

180
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:49,732
You easily believe

181
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:50,691
that's why…

182
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:52,526
That's why what?

183
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,695
That I am gullible?

184
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:56,822
Is that what you're saying?

185
00:10:57,531 --> 00:11:00,159
No.

186
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:02,620
That's not what I mean.

187
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,998
That's why you get abused easily

188
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,709
because you're too kind.

189
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:15,716
Stop it. Don't get mad anymore.

190
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,346
Didn't I promise you that I would change?

191
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,349
I'm a good girl now.

192
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:29,313
But, you know, Galvan…

193
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,525
Before you celebrate,

194
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,946
I think you should make sure…

195
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:41,534
that the baby in George's womb
is your grandchild, right?

196
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,661
Because…

197
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,123
didn't she meet her ex-boyfriend,

198
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,457
the investigator?

199
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:50,209
What's his name again?

200
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:53,045
It's Abdul, right?

201
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:58,175
And how many months is George pregnant?

202
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,262
Because here in the estate,

203
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,597
they always see George

204
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,724
and Attorney Iñigo together.

205
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,685
Mom, just stop it.

206
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:10,771
We all know that George
is not that kind of woman.

207
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,024
- She's decent.
- Okay, okay, fine.

208
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:16,110
Let's say that…

209
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,320
Sofia is right.

210
00:12:20,197 --> 00:12:21,574
The question is,

211
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,290
is George really pregnant?

212
00:12:33,878 --> 00:12:35,004
Francis, no.

213
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,047
What you're thinking is too dangerous.

214
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,217
- Have you forgotten what Mom said?
- What, Sam?

215
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:43,012
That the guards will shoot us if we leave?

216
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:45,181
Well, then go.
Let's see who'll shoot first.

217
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,309
Francis, why… Oh, my God.
Why do you have a gun?

218
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:50,769
Mother, I bought this from my inmate.

219
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,480
He got out the other day.

220
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,029
Maybe…

221
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:03,199
she just made it up.

222
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,701
She's pretending,

223
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,828
so she won't be accused.

224
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:10,498
Remember, she's being accused

225
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:14,210
of being the killer
here on the Palacios Estate?

226
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,047
So, she's pretending…

227
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,423
so she won't be accused.

228
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,218
That way,

229
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:25,387
your father will pity her

230
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,224
and she has an ally.

231
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,601
Right, Sofia?

232
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,774
Do you want to see proof, Vivian?

233
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,821
Proof, George?

234
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,909
That's easy to fake.

235
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:50,663
That's not a fake.

236
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:52,039
- What's with you?
- Don't touch me.

237
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:53,624
Vivian.

238
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,626
Galvan, she attacked me.

239
00:13:55,709 --> 00:13:58,462
I'm just defending myself.

240
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,089
Why won't I get ahead of you

241
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:01,674
when you're talking too much?

242
00:14:01,757 --> 00:14:04,093
My daughter is not pretending.

243
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:05,970
Well, then fine.

244
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,097
She's pregnant if she truly is.

245
00:14:08,597 --> 00:14:11,100
The question is, who is the father?

246
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,184
You're really a fool.

247
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:14,812
- Of course, Basil is the father.
- That's enough.

248
00:14:14,895 --> 00:14:15,729
That's enough.

249
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:16,897
I said stop it.

250
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,274
- What? He said stop.
- I said stop it.

251
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:19,191
- He said stop.
- Stop it.

252
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:21,026
- It's her…
- Stop it.

253
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:22,736
Stop it.

254
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:23,821
- You too.
- Talk to her.

255
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,698
- Stop it.
- She pushed me.

256
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,659
- Go ahead, talk more.
- Okay…

257
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:29,743
- Be thankful I've changed already.
- Oh, shh.

258
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:30,828
I said stop it.

259
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,663
- He said, stop it.
- Okay, fine.

260
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,582
Fine, fine.

261
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:35,833
No more.

262
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,503
To avoid all the doubts,

263
00:14:40,296 --> 00:14:42,423
I'll have the baby's DNA tested.

264
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,468
Are you insulting me, Dad?

265
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,723
You don't believe that Basil is the father
of the baby I'm carrying?

266
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:52,558
What are you trying to say?

267
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,394
That I flirted and had sex
with someone else?

268
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:59,481
It's a good thing Sofia sees

269
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,234
that I'm not that kind of a woman.

270
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,571
If that's really Basil's baby,

271
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:08,574
you will not refuse.

272
00:15:09,408 --> 00:15:10,451
Just like Beverly.

273
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,370
She had a DNA test before.

274
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,208
- Francis, no.
- Sam. Sam.

275
00:15:18,292 --> 00:15:19,460
- Give that to me. Give that to me.
- Sam.

276
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,629
You will not use that
because we are not leaving here.

277
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:22,963
Sam, let's leave.

278
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:24,965
I don't want you to go to jail.

279
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,967
I've experienced life in prison.

280
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,968
Sam, it's difficult.

281
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,889
You can't take it,
especially if you're pregnant.

282
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:35,267
No.

283
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,436
She can't put me in jail.

284
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,813
Francis, she doesn't have proof.

285
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:41,982
What's her proof? Her word?

286
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,026
Sam…

287
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:48,197
What if… she finds the video?

288
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,032
Video?

289
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:52,284
What video, Mother?

290
00:15:58,415 --> 00:15:59,667
Mother? Sam?

291
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:02,461
Is there still something
you haven't told me?

292
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,425
Francis…

293
00:16:10,594 --> 00:16:12,763
the night I pushed Paco,

294
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,977
Basil was able to record it
on his cellphone.

295
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:19,895
What?

296
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:29,363
Beverly was Basil's mistress.

297
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:31,657
She could've had other lovers too.

298
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,326
I was, I still am Basil's wife,

299
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:36,328
and I've been loyal to him.

300
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,247
That's why I'm sure he is
the father of my baby

301
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,748
and no one else.

302
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,042
That's what you say.

303
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:45,004
If what you're saying is true,

304
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:49,133
you shouldn't be scared of the DNA test.

305
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,093
I'm really not scared.

306
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:54,346
Now, if that's what
you really want, then fine.

307
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:56,724
Just tell me when and where.
I'll take that DNA test.

308
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:57,766
I'll be there.

309
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:58,809
Good.

310
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:01,437
I'll have it set up.

311
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:07,693
I'm telling you this, Dad,
especially you, Vivian.

312
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,653
You'll be embarrassed.

313
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,116
Because as God is my witness,
this is Basil's baby.

314
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:22,958
Let's see who will be humiliated.

315
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,752
Mommy, what's with you?

316
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:25,878
What?

317
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:28,922
- I'm not doing anything.
- You know…

318
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:29,882
What?

319
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:33,052
Sometimes it makes me think…

320
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,598
that your daughter
is more mature than you.

321
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:41,226
Listen to her sometimes.

322
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:45,272
I'm not doing anything.

323
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,234
Hey, you.

324
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:53,447
Don't humiliate me in front of others.

325
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:55,949
Especially in front of your daddy.

326
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:04,291
Then act like a mature woman, Mom.

327
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,294
Sometimes, you're more immature than me.

328
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,630
What?

329
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,508
This kid is so shameless. Sofia.

330
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,093
Sofia.

331
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:16,720
Sofia.

332
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,266
No wonder.

333
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:26,021
No wonder, when Basil was killed,
you keep on looking for your cellphone.

334
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:29,149
It turns out you were looking
for Basil's cellphone.

335
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,737
Sam, what are you doing here again?

336
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,280
I already told you this is off-limits.

337
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:36,657
You're so hard-headed.

338
00:18:37,574 --> 00:18:39,785
How did you know about the video?

339
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:43,705
Basil showed it to me.

340
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,417
Why didn't he surrender
that to the police?

341
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,470
He is asking for something in return.

342
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,889
I want you to kill someone for me.

343
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:02,558
Who?

344
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,395
Your best friend.

345
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,690
George?

346
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,569
He wants us to leave this estate.

347
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,363
He doesn't want…

348
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:18,782
me and George to be together here.

349
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,876
We really need to find that cellphone.

350
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,795
Because if we don't find it,

351
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:33,255
for sure the investigators will find it.

352
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,340
And if they find that,

353
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:36,925
no matter where we go,
no matter where we hide,

354
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,011
Sam, you'll become wanted.

355
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,930
We need to get ahead of them.

356
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,454
Hello, Sergeant Royales.

357
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,168
Interview?

358
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,671
Tomorrow?

359
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,557
Ms. Aurora is insisting

360
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,644
that she saw you
with an umbrella below the cliff.

361
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,939
Yes, detective. That's true.

362
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,567
But, I didn't kill Paco.

363
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,695
And no evidence will prove
that I killed my husband

364
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,614
because I didn't kill him.

365
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,037
And how do you explain this?

366
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,747
It shows your shoe print on the cliff.

367
00:20:52,167 --> 00:20:53,585
Yes, because I was there.

368
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,379
I was on the cliff.

369
00:20:55,462 --> 00:20:57,256
That's why I saw Paco.

370
00:20:59,883 --> 00:21:01,385
But, my question is,

371
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,428
Detective…

372
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:07,641
why were my shoe prints
only seen that night?

373
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,727
George and Mom Aurora were also there.

374
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:13,230
Mama Aurora even showed
where she was standing that night.

375
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,482
And George, she never denied it.

376
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,026
Actually, Ms. George also has shoe prints,

377
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,737
but Sergeant Casas set it aside.

378
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:24,574
And that's why George
was excluded from this case.

379
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,915
Sergeant Casas covered up for George?

380
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,837
Well, that makes her more
of a suspect than me.

381
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:39,923
We will also look at that angle.

382
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,678
And Mom Aurora, she was there too.

383
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,098
Yes.

384
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:50,100
And even if she accused you,

385
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,145
there's a possibility
that she's just transferring her sin

386
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:54,271
to someone else.

387
00:21:54,354 --> 00:21:55,981
But, then again, Ms. Samantha.

388
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,733
All of these are just theories

389
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,610
until we find a piece of strong evidence

390
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,988
to show if Paco Palacios
was really pushed,

391
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,865
or he intentionally jumped.

392
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:10,746
And let me confirm
your last statement to the police.

393
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,957
You believe that Paco
jumped off the cliff.

394
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,170
I will jump and I will take you with me.

395
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,422
- Come on.
- Let go of me.

396
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,058
Yes, Detective.

397
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,601
Because I heard his scream…

398
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,315
That's why I went
to him there, but it was too late.

399
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,358
He was already dead.

400
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:44,613
And if we're going back
to Basil's statement

401
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,156
that night…

402
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:48,992
he said he called Paco

403
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,411
and he told him
that he would commit suicide.

404
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:55,290
I was really hoping
that Sam really killed Paco.

405
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:59,920
So that what my cousin said
would not come true.

406
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:02,839
He will end his life at midnight.

407
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,593
Auntie, I called him
to talk about business.

408
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:09,846
But, when he answered, he was crying.

409
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,475
Okay.

410
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,561
Last question, Ms. Samantha.

411
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,565
Are you sure…

412
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,151
you didn't see anyone else on the cliff?

413
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:29,491
You'll regret doing this, Dad.

414
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:33,620
Really?

415
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,164
And why?

416
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:46,633
It's really expensive
to do a prenatal DNA test.

417
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,717
Oh, yes.

418
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,680
Galvan even paid ten times more
than its original price

419
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,767
to get the DNA test result right away.

420
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:58,436
- Is he in a hurry?
- Yes.

421
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,189
Because he wants to find out right away

422
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,609
that Basil is not the father
of George's baby.

423
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:15,745
Thank you. Thank you very much.

424
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:22,210
That night was dark…

425
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:26,506
and I was bothered, Detective.

426
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,427
But, from what I remember,

427
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,638
I didn't see anyone else until I…

428
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,683
until I reached the bottom of the cliff.

429
00:24:36,766 --> 00:24:37,934
I saw…

430
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,478
I saw my husband dead already.

431
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:44,441
Detective…

432
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:50,405
I just remembered.

433
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:56,536
This woman's shoe prints were
seen on top of the cliff.

434
00:24:57,162 --> 00:25:00,123
She was able to get away

435
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:02,500
because that useless
Sergeant Casas didn't think

436
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:04,044
that she used an umbrella.

437
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,879
Come on, Vivian.

438
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:07,756
Don't start.

439
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:09,799
I don't want to get into a fight.

440
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,259
My dress is new.

441
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,222
I don't want this
to be tainted by your blood.

442
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,599
Ruth, I've changed now.

443
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:18,683
Really?

444
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,352
Yes.

445
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,104
I don't fight with people like you…

446
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:28,235
who are cheap,
from the squatters, and loud.

447
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:32,155
Looks like you're just
describing yourself.

448
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,782
Not really.

449
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:38,453
I'm not as classy as Aurora,

450
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,957
but I'm not like you
who is without breeding.

451
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,833
Oh, my.

452
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,002
Vivian, you have no breeding.
You're stupid.

453
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,170
Because if you had breeding,

454
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,631
Sir Galvan would have married you
a long time ago.

455
00:25:50,215 --> 00:25:51,508
What did you say?

456
00:25:51,591 --> 00:25:52,592
Vivian.

457
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:58,306
I was so stupid.

458
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:01,059
I also overlooked this detail.

459
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,646
Because I stopped thinking

460
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,857
that it was you
who pushed my son, Samantha.

461
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,069
You made me believe that you're innocent

462
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:14,739
to the point
that I completely ruled you out

463
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:15,907
as a suspect.

464
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,703
You're so good.

465
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:23,790
You're so good at lying, Samantha.

466
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:28,503
You fooled Aurora Palacios.

467
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,010
Serves you right. What's that again?

468
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:36,261
Won't you really stop?

469
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,475
Galvan, I'm not doing anything.

470
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,810
It's Ruth's fault.

471
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,270
See?

472
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,563
She's insulting me.

473
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:49,232
Well, she keeps on saying
something about George.

474
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,567
Why?

475
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:52,736
Is it bad to tell the truth?

476
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,821
I'm just saying, Galvan,

477
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,531
that there's a possibility

478
00:26:56,614 --> 00:26:58,033
that Basil is not the father

479
00:26:58,116 --> 00:26:59,409
of George's baby, right?

480
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:01,411
Vivian, stop it.

481
00:27:05,206 --> 00:27:08,668
But, I will never let you
fool me again, Sam.

482
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:11,087
Mom…

483
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:14,674
I didn't fool you, Mom.

484
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:17,302
It's a good thing that you're here

485
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,721
because we were talking about
the botched investigation

486
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,473
of Sergeant Casas.

487
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:24,184
You don't have to tell me

488
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:28,271
that Sergeant Casas did such
a sloppy job investigating

489
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:30,565
because he let you be acquitted.

490
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,400
Mom, it's not me.

491
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,152
Mom, it's George.

492
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:38,114
Mom, Sergeant Casas covered up for George.

493
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,991
Mom, didn't it cross your mind?

494
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,659
Aren't you wondering?

495
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,745
There were three of us there that night,

496
00:27:43,828 --> 00:27:46,164
but they only saw our shoe prints.

497
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,500
Because Sergeant Casas
covered up for George

498
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:50,043
that night.

499
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,671
If my grandson comes out,

500
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:56,257
the baby George is pregnant with,

501
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,761
and you continue to taunt her family,

502
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,847
I'll send you back to Baguio.

503
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:05,100
No need, Dad.

504
00:28:06,351 --> 00:28:07,852
Because we're leaving.

505
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,354
There you go.

506
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:13,858
I just agreed to this stupid DNA test

507
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:17,195
to prove that I am carrying Basil's child.

508
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:21,991
But, I won't agree
to him growing up here with you.

509
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,413
So, what are you saying now, Sam?

510
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,207
That it's George?

511
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:31,626
Is it George who pushed Paco?

512
00:28:31,709 --> 00:28:34,629
Mom, all I'm saying is
if you have any doubts,

513
00:28:34,712 --> 00:28:36,005
don't just doubt me.

514
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,175
You, Mom…

515
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,095
You were there.

516
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,267
And before the police were able
to prove that Paco committed suicide,

517
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,770
they never considered you
as a suspect, Mom.

518
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,106
But, can you remember, Mom?

519
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:56,276
You and Paco were fighting before he died.

520
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:58,319
Stop insinuating…

521
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,948
that I pushed my own son.

522
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:07,954
Is this what you said earlier
that I will regret?

523
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,039
Yes.

524
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,334
Because I will take away
mine and Basil's baby.

525
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,005
I will not let him grow up here.

526
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,923
And my future child will know

527
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,800
that his grandfather doubted him

528
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:22,969
even though he was still in my belly.

529
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,220
Wait, George.

530
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:30,018
- You animal.
- Ma'am, stop it.

531
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:33,229
Don't do something that you'll regret.

532
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:34,355
I'll give you my word.

533
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,316
I'll dig deeper into this case.

534
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,443
Aside from what Ms. Samantha mentioned,

535
00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:42,447
I also saw a discrepancy
in Sergeant Casas' report.

536
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:43,948
In my watch,

537
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,827
I'll make sure that no detail is missed.

538
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,250
Mom…

539
00:29:54,334 --> 00:29:57,170
Mom, this is what I'm talking about.

540
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,131
Opening Paco's case will only hurt you.

541
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:02,342
And it will hurt me, Mom.

542
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,344
Because we'll just go back
to all the painful things

543
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,054
that happened that night, Mom.

544
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:07,388
Mom…

545
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:09,349
Mom, believe me.

546
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:12,936
I didn't kill Paco.

547
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,271
I believe he committed suicide.

548
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:19,526
That's also what Basil said before, right?

549
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,194
No.

550
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,031
My son didn't jump off the cliff.

551
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:28,243
- You pushed him.
- Ms. Aurora, please. Stop it.

552
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:35,375
And they have the nerve to be proud.

553
00:30:38,711 --> 00:30:40,505
Don't worry, Galvan.

554
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,174
They only want you to go after them.

555
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:58,147
Oh. I swear to God, Sam.

556
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,193
I will find evidence to prove

557
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,362
that you pushed my son.

558
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,574
You won't find anything, Mom.

559
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,909
- You won't find anything.
- There is.

560
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,955
I will use my money,

561
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:18,835
my power, my connections, Sam.

562
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:24,007
I can find evidence against you

563
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:27,302
because no sin goes unrevealed.

564
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,846
There is no stench that does not smell.

565
00:31:31,472 --> 00:31:33,766
You pushed Paco.

566
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:40,648
I will find evidence
that will pin you down, Sam.

567
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,860
Even if I have to invent one.

568
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:49,824
Ma'am, do you think

569
00:31:49,908 --> 00:31:52,869
I will accept fake and invented evidence?

570
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,829
Oh, Detective…

571
00:31:56,497 --> 00:32:00,335
If I will invent an evidence,

572
00:32:00,418 --> 00:32:05,256
I will make sure that even
you will be fooled.

573
00:32:12,639 --> 00:32:14,223
Ms. Samantha, excuse me.

574
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,816
Oh, my God.

575
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,116
Oh, my God.

576
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,077
Oh, my God.

577
00:32:52,095 --> 00:32:53,221
Francis…

578
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,264
Francis, we need
to find Basil's cellphone.

579
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:58,101
We need to find it.

580
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:05,483
Are you sure, Rebecca,
that you can recognize the nurse?

581
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,406
Maybe she's just here
in the hospital compound.

582
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,868
Jericho, I think she's the one.

583
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,955
Are you sure?

584
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:22,667
It's her.

585
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,383
Miss, excuse me.

586
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,384
Yes?

587
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,178
We just want to ask something.

588
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,275
- Sam.
- What, Francis?

589
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,318
- Did you find the cellphone?
- Not yet, Sam.

590
00:33:49,402 --> 00:33:50,403
Maybe it's inside Sir Galvan's house.

591
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:52,447
That's the only place
I couldn't enter. Maybe it's there.

592
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:53,906
I already looked there.

593
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:07,879
Not only once, but a lot of times.
But, there's nothing there.

594
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:11,549
Sam, could it be that someone else has it?

595
00:34:12,633 --> 00:34:15,219
His friends who attended the party.

596
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,847
Or, Basil gave it
to someone else for safekeeping.

597
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:20,808
To whom? With all the people
there in the party…

598
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:23,102
And besides, if someone has it,

599
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,021
why won't he give it to the police

600
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,522
when he knows they're investigating?

601
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,067
I don't know, Sam. I don't have an idea.

602
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,486
I'm just thinking of the possibilities.

603
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:35,114
Because if he gave his cellphone
to someone,

604
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:37,575
maybe we can find a way to get it.

605
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,370
I don't know, Sam. I'll find a way.

606
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,955
I'll sneak into the house.

607
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,541
I'm desperate to get that cellphone.

608
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:49,504
I'm also desperate.

609
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,090
Okay, let's try that.

610
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:57,762
Beatrice Royales, she's close to Basil.

611
00:34:58,513 --> 00:34:59,680
Hi.

612
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,850
- I'm Beatrice.
- Sam.

613
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:06,395
Okay, I'll find out where she lives.

614
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:10,274
Iñigo, he's Basil's best friend, right?

615
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:14,946
I'm sorry.

616
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:17,448
Wait.

617
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,699
Who else?

618
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:21,619
Who else could he give his cellphone to?

619
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:29,043
Miss, last time you approached me,

620
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,130
you were asking me about the twins.

621
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,589
How are you?

622
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,966
How are the twins?

623
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,051
Twins?

624
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:39,762
What?

625
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:42,014
I can't remember you.

626
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,641
Huh?

627
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:47,436
That's impossible. You were so sure.

628
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:48,646
There was just a Code Blue.

629
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:51,149
That's why you weren't able
to tell me right away and then you left.

630
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:54,152
Oh yeah, I remember.

631
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:57,155
I'm sorry, Ma'am. I made a mistake.

632
00:35:57,238 --> 00:36:01,033
I mistook you
for my former patient, Ma'am Esther.

633
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:02,535
I'm really sorry.

634
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,174
Miss, I'm begging you.
Please tell the truth.

635
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:19,635
I'm really sorry. I'm telling the truth.

636
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,721
I really made a mistake that time.

637
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,556
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

638
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:27,518
Rebecca…

639
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,812
Rebecca, wait.

640
00:36:38,654 --> 00:36:40,281
Hello, Sir Amando.

641
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:42,617
I already talked to Ma'am Rebecca.

642
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,537
Yes, sir. I did what you ordered me to do.

643
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:51,334
Kindly tell Ma'am Aurora that I apologize.

644
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:54,670
Sam, we need a copy of the guest list

645
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:58,174
because only Beatrice and Iñigo
are familiar to us.

646
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,803
Maybe it's better if we recall
what happened at the party.

647
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,598
Maybe we can think of a clue.

648
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:11,145
Wait, before Basil was poisoned,
he gave a speech.

649
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:17,360
To an extravagant year
and a fabulous future ahead of us.

650
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,821
Happy birthday to me.

651
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,782
Happy birthday.

652
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:27,411
Mom arrived and she asked me
to come up to the stage.

653
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:40,675
Before that, Ma'am Aurora
ruined Basil's grand entrance.

654
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,604
Sam…

655
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,107
could it be
that Basil's cellphone is in the…

656
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,859
…motorcycle.

657
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,825
What the hell?

658
00:38:05,908 --> 00:38:08,577
I've been thinking about a lot
of things and you're adding to it.

659
00:38:09,161 --> 00:38:11,539
Why didn't Palacios Mining

660
00:38:11,622 --> 00:38:13,791
submit the compliance reports?

661
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:16,085
And you only tell me

662
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:19,380
when the Department of
Environmental Protection

663
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,174
and Resource Management

664
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,969
gives a warning
of suspension of operations.

665
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,847
Madam, it was Sir Basil
who made the report.

666
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,181
What?

667
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,808
Basil is dead.

668
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:33,311
So, where is the report?

669
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:36,897
It's not in the office
computer of Sir Basil.

670
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:46,198
Amando, get Basil's laptop
in the other house.

671
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,284
I'm sure the report is there.

672
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,411
- Yes, madam.
- Go, now.

673
00:38:51,704 --> 00:38:52,663
God.

674
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:57,126
Sam, is that the one?

675
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:58,627
Yes, that's the one.

676
00:39:03,132 --> 00:39:05,217
I hope the key is here.

677
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,600
Here's the key.

678
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,603
- Here it is.
- Hurry up.

679
00:39:18,981 --> 00:39:20,399
Hurry up.

680
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,236
- I can't open it.
- Let's go.

681
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,322
- Someone is there. Come on.
- What? Hold on.

682
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,245
Sam, the key.

683
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,404
I think he's gone.

684
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:13,953
- Hurry up.
- All right.

685
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,294
There you go, Sam. There.

686
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:40,312
- This is it.
- That's it?

687
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,398
This is Basil's cellphone.

688
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,195
Amando, hurry.

689
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,450
Hurry. Amando. There's a password, madam.

690
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,909
I'll call Sir Galvan, maybe he knows.

691
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,202
No need.

692
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:03,544
Mario…

693
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,089
What is Basil's password on his laptop?

694
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:15,890
The Great Basil 04101989.

695
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:18,684
Yuck.

696
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,978
How narcissistic, Basil.

697
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:25,941
Great Basil…

698
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:32,948
04101989…

699
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,498
What?

700
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:45,169
I have access to everything, Amando,
and you know that.

701
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:57,640
Make sure, Basil,
that you've finished these reports.

702
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,475
Because if not,

703
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,312
I will dig you up from your grave.

704
00:42:07,274 --> 00:42:09,693
Francis, we need to dispose of this.

705
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,409
Wait, Sam.

706
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,873
Go ahead. There's no one here.

707
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:57,950
I just emailed the compliance reports.

708
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,786
Send them first thing tomorrow.

709
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:33,027
<i>I did not kill Doc Orly.</i>

710
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,613
<i>You don't know your father.</i>

711
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:39,408
Samantha.

712
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:41,410
NEXT EPISODE

713
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,496
You're so shameless
to visit my son's altar

714
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,958
after you pushed him off the cliff.

715
00:43:48,042 --> 00:43:50,252
<i>I will take my son away from here.</i>

716
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,254
I don't want him to grow up

717
00:43:52,338 --> 00:43:54,923
and know that his own grandfather

718
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,467
doubted him.

719
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:57,968
You're not going anywhere.

720
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,721
I won't allow it. My grandson stays here.

00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:03,432
<i>He will be born here,</i>
<i>he will grow up here,</i>

00:44:03,515 --> 00:44:04,350
<i>and grow old here.</i>

723
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:07,478
<i>I will count to three,</i>

724
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:09,438
<i>and if you still won't confess,</i>

<i>and mother to call.</i>

726
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:14,568

<i>- Don't.</i>

729
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,281
Three.

730
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:20,324
Yes!
