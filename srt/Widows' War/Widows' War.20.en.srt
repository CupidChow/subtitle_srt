1
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,150
Daddy! Daddy!

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,903
- Yes, Sofia?
- It's Bev. She's in danger!

3
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:10,904
- What?
- Come on!

4
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:12,072
We gotta go, Uncle.

5
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:13,239
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,407
Beverly?

7
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,330
No!

8
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,465
Look for the person who did this to her!

9
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:31,508
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir.

10
00:01:33,384 --> 00:01:35,011
Cairo, come here!

11
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,513
Cairo!

12
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,184
No one will leave this room

13
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,187
unless we are assured
that it's safe outside.

14
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:47,357
Anyone who tries to enter that door,

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,442
don't hesitate to shoot that person.

16
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,276
Who's there?

17
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,112
Mother!

18
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,281
Mother! Hold on! Hold on!

19
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:56,407
My God, Mercy!

20
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,159
We almost shot you!

21
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,119
I saw that.

22
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,621
That's what Bev's killer was wearing.

23
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,539
Listen to me first.

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,457
What else do I have to listen to?

25
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:05,875
I am a Palacios.

26
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,418
We're siblings, Ma'am Rebecca.

27
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,545
No, that's not true.

28
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:09,963
- What are you saying?
- Look at this.

29
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,715
No one should know that we're siblings,
especially Ma'am Aurora.

30
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:13,716
I'm looking for Papa.

31
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,301
But Papa is dead.

32
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:17,303
<i>I've been suspecting that he's</i>
<i>still alive for a long time now.</i>

33
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,180
<i>I opened his coffin and it was empty.</i>

34
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:27,981
Here.

35
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,668
Jerico, are you sure?

36
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,462
Yes, I am sure.

37
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,049
I opened it.

38
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:57,886
Papa's body wasn't there.

39
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,265
So maybe that's why…

40
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,394
Yes.

41
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,479
That's the reason why

42
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:10,732
I don't sense Papa's spirit.

43
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:13,610
Because he is still alive.

44
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:17,238
But where is he?

45
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,575
What happened to him?

46
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,162
That's what I want to find out.

47
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,164
So please, Rebecca,

48
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:29,500
I hope no one finds out that
we're siblings

49
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,962
until I find Papa.

50
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,049
"Our."

51
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,344
Our Papa.

52
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,806
We will look for our papa.

53
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:03,534
We're just at the back of the house.

54
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,249
The question is,

55
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:10,458
where is he?

56
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:17,757
Sir, there's…

57
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,556
Does this belong to the killer?

58
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,022
That's a woman's bracelet.

59
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,568
Does that mean Ms. Beverly's killer
is a woman?

60
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,990
I know who owns this.

61
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,373
Where is your daughter, who's a killer?

62
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:52,125
Killer?

63
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,459
Who's the killer?

64
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,627
George is.

65
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,338
She owns this, right?

66
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,340
I found this along the escape route

67
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,175
used by the person who killed Beverly.

68
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,473
Yes, that's George's.

69
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:09,684
Basil gave it to her.

70
00:05:09,767 --> 00:05:12,603
But that doesn't mean she killed Beverly.

71
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:16,190
Maybe she just dropped it.

72
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,321
Answer me.

73
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:23,281
Where is George?

74
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,452
She went out earlier.
She hasn't come back yet.

75
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,873
Alert all the security guards.

76
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:33,458
Look for George!

77
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:39,714
Sir Galvan, George is innocent.

78
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:42,800
I raised her well.

79
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,636
She's not even capable of hurting someone.
How could she kill someone?

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,263
She already did!

81
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:49,098
During the gender reveal!

82
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:50,767
<i>Don't come near us!</i>

83
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,936
I swear to God, I will stab this woman.

84
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,147
After humiliating me,

85
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:57,607
after embarrassing me,

86
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,984
why would I give you an inch of mercy?

87
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,612
But that was different.

88
00:06:03,404 --> 00:06:05,615
George is a good person.

89
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:07,784
She's a good daughter-in-law.

90
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,536
She would never do
what you're accusing her of doing.

91
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,746
She killed Beverly.

92
00:06:11,829 --> 00:06:13,372
She killed my grandson!

93
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:16,709
Sir Galvan, George is innocent.

94
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,044
Prove it!

95
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:19,879
Bring George to me,

96
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,633
or else I will personally
bring her to jail.

97
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:36,187
Ma'am Rebecca is already in her room
with Nurse Angie.

98
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:40,483
There's a guard
stationed outside her room, madam.

99
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,818
Good, Amando.

100
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:48,449
We can never be sure that we're safe
unless they catch the killer.

101
00:06:50,493 --> 00:06:52,912
Excuse me, madam.

102
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,206
Go, go, go.

103
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,837
Are you sure about that?

104
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,131
Over and out.

105
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,258
What is it, Amando?

106
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,140
They still haven't caught them, but…

107
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:14,225
they already know who the killer is.

108
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,438
Who?

109
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:20,815
George.

110
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:23,609
I knew it.

111
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,195
I have to go, madam.

112
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,374
Admit it.

113
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,585
You have something to do with
what happened to Beverly, right?

114
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,129
I don't.

115
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,466
I came back from the police station.
I was visiting Francis.

116
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,553
You are always lying to me!

117
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:51,721
Mother…

118
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:54,682
Mother, I didn't kill Beverly.

119
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:59,520
The only thing I'm guilty of was
telling Beverly that George is infertile.

120
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:01,355
It was you?

121
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,652
It was you who exposed that George
would never have a child!

122
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,700
My sister is not a killer!

123
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:16,621
She's just being wrongly accused.

124
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,627
I also don't believe what Mommy said.

125
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,755
Yes, she's mad at Beverly.

126
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,507
But murder?

127
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,050
That's too much.

128
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,552
What if we just look for your sister?

129
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,263
Let her clarify herself.

130
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,973
Wow.

131
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,101
Even if you look for your sister,

132
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,897
she can't escape.

133
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,610
Because we found her bracelet
near the crime scene.

134
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,988
What if someone planted that?
What if someone set her up?

135
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,992
He's right. I have read about
things like that happening.

136
00:08:55,076 --> 00:09:00,081
Someone else is framed
so the real killer won't be suspected.

137
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,458
So, who was it?

138
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:06,003
Ma'am Beverly doesn't have
any other enemies.

139
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:09,632
It was only George who was mad at her.

140
00:09:10,132 --> 00:09:14,470
Because like they said,
she was cheated on.

141
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:15,596
You're so arrogant!

142
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,889
Ward, Ward, Ward!

143
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:20,560
Hey, we are still the boss of you.

144
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,981
- You're just a servant here.
- Yes. I am just a servant.

145
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:30,152
But I am not a murderer.

146
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,696
- You're a jerk!
- Ward!

147
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:34,031
- Hey! Ward, please!
- Ward!

148
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,623
You told Beverly that George was barren?

149
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,333
Ruth, wait.

150
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,002
Sit down first and let's talk about it.

151
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,211
No! No!

152
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,632
This daughter of yours is the reason
Beverly and George fought.

153
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:56,012
Why did George get triggered
and cornered?

154
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,098
You just wanted to make it look like
my daughter is a bad person!

155
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:03,644
I only told the truth.

156
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,187
Even so!

157
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,108
You intentionally did that
so they would fight,

158
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:12,111
and George would look like the bad person.

159
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,406
What about it?

160
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,910
Are you still insisting that
your daughter is innocent?

161
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,371
Even when they are accusing her
of killing Beverly?

162
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:24,582
Maybe she even killed Basil!

163
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,417
Stop it, Sam.

164
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:28,544
Sam…

165
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,590
Why are you accusing George?

166
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:36,969
Weren't you friends before?

167
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,931
I know that you know in your heart

168
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:43,851
that my daughter is a good person.

169
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:49,231
What has she done wrong to you, Sam?

170
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,651
What of it?

171
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,903
What about my brother?

172
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:59,325
What has my brother done wrong,
and why is he rotting in jail…

173
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:04,622
while the real killer walks free?

174
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,168
So that's it.

175
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:11,253
So, the truth finally comes out.

176
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,756
You came up with this scheme

177
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,675
so George and Beverly
would end up fighting.

178
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,555
Or maybe…

179
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:25,476
it was you who killed Beverly

180
00:11:25,559 --> 00:11:28,521
and you just want George to be accused.

181
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,108
Don't try to pin this on me.

182
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:36,153
I didn't kill Beverly.

183
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,489
Go and ask your daughter who did!

184
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,370
- Hey, hey, hey!
- You fool!

185
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,414
Even if you are young,
I'll fight with you!

186
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,499
Don't disrespect my sister!

187
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,959
- You're a jerk.
- Stop it!

188
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:51,919
That's enough!

189
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,380
Go ahead!

190
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,340
Come closer!

191
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,218
Fight back!

192
00:12:01,679 --> 00:12:02,805
Come on, fight back.

193
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,473
Let it go, it's okay.

194
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:06,851
- Ward, let it go.
- What?

195
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:12,731
All right, I'll stop. Chill.
Why don't we do this?

196
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:17,403
Let's race to find your sister George.

197
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,363
- Oh, it's okay!
- Come on!

198
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:20,948
Just leave, please.

199
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,783
Bye-bye.

200
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,459
Hey!

201
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,210
Ward, calm down.

202
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:38,591
Hey.

203
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,237
Sir, Ms. George is not inside the estate.

204
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,947
What do you mean?

205
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:04,074
It's impossible that she's not here.

206
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,784
Sir, no…

207
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:08,037
Sir, her car is not outside.

208
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,082
She left this afternoon
and still hasn't returned.

209
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,629
Sir, could it be that
what Ms. Ruth said is true?

210
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,131
That Ms. George is not at the estate?

211
00:13:19,215 --> 00:13:21,425
Of course she has an alibi!

212
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,677
What's with you? George planned all this.

213
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:26,931
George made sure she wasn't around
when Beverly died

214
00:13:27,014 --> 00:13:29,350
so she wouldn't be accused.

215
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,102
But the thing is, she's stupid.

216
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:33,979
She left a piece of evidence.

217
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,356
Her bracelet!

218
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,902
Look for her.

219
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,950
I will give reward money
to whoever finds her.

220
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,120
Hon…

221
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,623
just relax.

222
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:55,918
Don't worry.
I already talked to the police.

223
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,419
They will look for George.

224
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:01,423
Just rest first.

225
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:05,177
I will not rest until I see
that woman arrested.

226
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:09,515
She will pay for what she did
to Beverly and my grandson!

227
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,267
Oh yes, she will.

228
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:18,023
And when that happens,

229
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:22,444
it's goodbye, George.

230
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,076
Come with me!
Explain everything you said to Sir Galvan!

231
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:31,203
- Let me go! I don't want to go with you!
- Come with me!

232
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,957
No, you have no choice!
You need to clear my daughter's name.

233
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,335
You have to tell him it's your fault
that Beverly and George fought.

234
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:40,129
- Let me go!
- Be careful with Sam!

235
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:43,674
Come with me! Clear George's name!

236
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:45,342
She's pregnant! She's pregnant!

237
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:48,762
- Mother! Mother!
- Come with me!

238
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:53,475
No, they need to know it's your fault
that Beverly and George fought!

239
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:59,356
- You need to clear her name!
- No! I won't clear her name!

240
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,359
- Let me go!
- Get your hands off Sam now!

241
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,278
Can you stop? That's enough!

242
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:16,498
I still can't contact George.

243
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,088
I'm sorry.

244
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,593
But you're the only one
I can ask for help.

245
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,309
Everyone here is thinking ill of George.

246
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,524
Okay.

247
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,653
I'll wait for you.

248
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,824
What did Attorney Inigo say?

249
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:55,913
He will help us search for George.

250
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,752
Ward.

251
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:03,671
Here, have a drink first.

252
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:15,099
Thank you.

253
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:18,811
You didn't forsake me.

254
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:20,354
What's with you?

255
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:21,605
We're friends.

256
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,109
One person's fight is everybody's fight.

257
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,989
But, bro, we heard Cairo talking,

258
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:35,953
Auntie Ruth is in the middle of a fight
that we can't meddle in.

259
00:16:37,121 --> 00:16:38,288
Why?

260
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,748
What's happening to Mother?

261
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,959
I just heard hearsay, bro.
You'd better check it out.

262
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:50,134
Ma'am Aurora, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to.

263
00:16:50,217 --> 00:16:51,510
It's Sam's fault.

264
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,932
I'm sorry.

265
00:16:57,474 --> 00:17:01,979
How dare you come into my house,

266
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,773
make trouble,

267
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,026
and hurt me

268
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:10,154
and the mother of my grandchild!

269
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,698
Ma'am, I just want to clear
my daughter's name

270
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,324
because she's not at fault.

271
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,701
George is innocent.

272
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,828
She didn't kill Beverly.

273
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:19,496
Ma'am, that's all.

274
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,588
Ruth.

275
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:29,548
Maybe you're right.

276
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:38,640
Maybe you think George
is incapable of killing.

277
00:17:45,022 --> 00:17:46,356
But I am.

278
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,615
Don't, please…

279
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:56,408
Don't kill me, ma'am.

280
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:58,243
Ma'am Aurora, I'm sorry.

281
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:00,079
I'm sorry. Ma'am.

282
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,497
- Ma, please…
- I didn't mean it.

283
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:04,500
Please, put down the gun. Please.

284
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,753
Ma'am. Ma'am Aurora.

285
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,881
Ma'am Aurora, let's not go that far.

286
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:14,051
Ruth is just stressed
because of what happened to George.

287
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,553
You're also a mother.

288
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:19,681
A mother would do anything
out of love for their child.

289
00:18:19,765 --> 00:18:20,933
Exactly!

290
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:26,647
I will not tolerate this woman
from hurting Sam.

291
00:18:29,566 --> 00:18:31,693
What if my grandchild dies?

292
00:18:33,862 --> 00:18:35,697
Can she take that back?

293
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,282
Tell me, Mercy.

294
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,495
Ma'am Aurora, I'm begging you.
Please don't hurt me.

295
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:43,622
Please don't kill me, ma'am.

296
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:46,750
Please, Ma'am Aurora. I'm really sorry.

297
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,418
- I'm really sorry.
- Ma'am Aurora.

298
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,379
Sorry.

299
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,964
Please, don't kill me.

300
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,508
Sorry, ma'am. I'm sorry.
Please, don't kill me.

301
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,260
Please, ma'am.

302
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:57,553
Ma'am Aurora…

303
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,388
Ma'am Aurora, please don't!

304
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,975
Just shoot me, not my mother!

305
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:04,643
Ward…

306
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,186
- Ma'am Aurora!
- No!

307
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:10,274
If my mother did something wrong,
let me… let me pay for it.

308
00:19:10,357 --> 00:19:12,067
- Ward!
- Ma'am Aurora!

309
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:14,611
Ward, get out of here.
I'll take care of this.

310
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:16,822
Don't play the hero. Just go, Ward.

311
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:19,283
Please, get out of here!

312
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:29,626
Hey, why did you stop?

313
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,880
Let's hurry. Think about the reward
we'll get if we find Ms. George.

314
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:40,179
Wait, why do you have that?

315
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,057
I'm just taking precautions.

316
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:49,563
Ma'am has a weapon
and you never know what could happen.

317
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,647
You're really something else.

318
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,234
- You'll fight with a woman?
- I will fight with anyone

319
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,111
as long as there's money at stake.

320
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:00,324
What's this?

321
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:01,950
You go first.

322
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,160
I'll follow.

323
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,536
Whatever.

324
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:19,885
Where are you, Father?

325
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,014
Where are you?

326
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,203
Hey, why are you taking a video of me?

327
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,704
Peter!

328
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,830
Don't come near me!

329
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,540
Don't come near me.

330
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,960
George is already missing.

331
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,670
I don't know where she went.

332
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:56,797
Now you're in danger too.

333
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,215
Ward…

334
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:04,346
Go ahead!

335
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,556
Shoot me!

336
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:08,725
No, don't!

337
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,769
So we can all be together!

338
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,062
Ma'am…

339
00:21:12,145 --> 00:21:13,981
- Ma, please! Please, please, please.
- Sam! Sam!

340
00:21:14,064 --> 00:21:16,817
I'm begging you, Ma.
Please. We're okay.

341
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,444
My baby and I are okay.
That's enough.

342
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,823
Please don't add to the bloodshed.
Ma, please, please.

343
00:21:22,906 --> 00:21:25,492
- Please.
- Ma'am Aurora…

344
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:29,204
Ma'am.

345
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,331
Mother…

346
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,254
Be thankful to Sam.

347
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,300
Because if it weren't for her,

348
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:46,888
you would both be buried
together with Beverly!

349
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:48,307
Thank…

350
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:51,518
Ma'am, thank you.

351
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,437
Now scram!

352
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,898
Get out of my house!

353
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,378
Are you okay?

354
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:23,216
Are you sure?

355
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:00,879
Peter, delete that.

356
00:23:00,962 --> 00:23:01,797
Oh?

357
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,633
Why?

358
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,387
What's wrong with what you did?

359
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:14,267
You were only looking at the picture
of your father, right?

360
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:17,521
Don't speak so loudly.
Someone might hear you.

361
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,066
Why are you being so paranoid?

362
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,487
Why don't you want to tell them
that you're a Palacios?

363
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,781
Who knows?

364
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,867
Sir Galvan might give you
a big inheritance.

365
00:23:30,951 --> 00:23:33,453
Especially now that
he doesn't have a grandson.

366
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,582
I don't care about
the Palacios family's money.

367
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,628
What I want is to know the truth
about my father.

368
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,924
So please delete that.

369
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:57,310
What are you talking about here?

370
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:09,489
If you were not pregnant,
I would hurt you.

371
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:11,158
You're lucky.

372
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,662
Mother, why are you so mad at me?

373
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:16,872
I am innocent.

374
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,166
I didn't kill Beverly!

375
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,753
But you made the fight between
George and Beverly worse.

376
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:28,717
Because of you, George did
what she's been accused of doing!

377
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,927
I didn't force George to kill Beverly.

378
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,513
She did that, Mother!

379
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,473
Are you not…

380
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:38,435
Are you not bothered
by your conscience even a little?

381
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,438
A lot of people have died already!

382
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,983
Including Galvan's grandson.
He's dead.

383
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,485
What do you want me to do about it?
What do you want me to do?

384
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,530
Do you want me to surrender to the police
and tell them that I am the reason

385
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,865
that there was murder here?

386
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:52,741
Is that it?

387
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,536
Mother…

388
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,831
Mother, can't you see?

389
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:02,792
George's true colors are coming out.

390
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:04,753
If she was able to kill Beverly,

391
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:07,631
then it's possible that she killed Basil.

392
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,850
Mother, I feel sorry.

393
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,271
I feel sorry
about what happened to Beverly.

394
00:25:24,522 --> 00:25:26,691
That's true, but…

395
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,736
I'm doing all this

396
00:25:29,819 --> 00:25:33,156
so that Francis can be free.

397
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,701
- Not in this way!
- Then in what way, Mother?!

398
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,535
In what way?

399
00:25:37,619 --> 00:25:43,041
Tell me because I don't know
anymore what to do.

400
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,501
I don't know!

401
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:48,171
I don't know because I can't just pray
the rosary and wait for a miracle

402
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:52,550
so they will set my brother free
like you are doing!

403
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,355
Are you arguing about something?

404
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,024
No.

405
00:26:09,567 --> 00:26:14,572
Peter, do you have a problem with Jerico?
Is there something I need to know?

406
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,575
Nothing.

407
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:22,539
Jerico and I were just talking about
the reward Sir Galvan's offering

408
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,292
if we catch Ma'am George, right?

409
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:27,836
Is that all?

410
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,087
Yes.

411
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,381
Okay, then continue on with the search.

412
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,842
I'm sure she hasn't gone far yet.

413
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,218
Look for George.

414
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:52,277
Here. Look at this.

415
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:55,905
Don't be paranoid anymore.

416
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:59,743
You know, Jerico, I'm on your side.

417
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:03,246
I won't tell them about your secret.

418
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,956
Okay?

419
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:11,588
If the day comes when you're ready
to tell them that you're a Palacios,

420
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:14,341
don't forget about me, huh?

421
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,659
Mother, go and rest first.

422
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,121
Inigo is on his way.

423
00:27:45,872 --> 00:27:47,791
We'll both look for George.

424
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,878
Why are they blaming George?

425
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:55,507
Why are they blaming us?

426
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,720
We'll overcome this, Mother.

427
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,933
How about you, Ward?

428
00:28:05,016 --> 00:28:09,646
You believe that George
is innocent, right?

429
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,065
Mother, I promise you,

430
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,693
even though you and George
think of me as a kid,

431
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,363
I will protect you.

432
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,281
Okay?

433
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:29,457
They will need to kill me first
before they can hurt you.

434
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,221
I am not a perfect person.

435
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,182
God knows

436
00:28:46,266 --> 00:28:49,853
that I am doing everything I can
to be a good mother to you and Francis!

437
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,522
Don't you dare tell me

438
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,901
that I'm not doing anything
for him and for you!

439
00:29:02,282 --> 00:29:03,825
I'm sorry.

440
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:06,494
I'm sorry.

441
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,704
Sorry.

442
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,000
We both know

443
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:17,255
that neither George nor I are the reason
Francis is in prison right now.

444
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,257
It's you.

445
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,387
You brought this problem to our family.

446
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,475
That's why I'll make up for it, Mother.

447
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:35,231
Mother, I can't do it on my own.

448
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,152
Mother, I need you.

449
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,363
I need an ally.

450
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:43,865
Mother…

451
00:29:46,993 --> 00:29:49,245
I don't know you anymore.

452
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:53,583
I don't know you.

453
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,463
You're not my daughter anymore.

454
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,090
I don't know you anymore.

455
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:04,928
- I don't know you anymore.
- Mother.

456
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,190
Hold this.

457
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,776
Hold this! Hold it!

458
00:30:21,694 --> 00:30:22,987
There.

459
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:24,280
Check if anything fell.

460
00:30:24,364 --> 00:30:25,615
Ma, this is wrong!

461
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,285
- What do you mean wrong?
- You're stealing George's jewelry.

462
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:32,664
- Someone might get ahead of us.
- I can't do this! I will report you.

463
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,665
To whom?

464
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,500
Who will you report me to? Your father?

465
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:39,003
He'll be on my side for sure because
all of them are mad at George now.

466
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:39,963
So you better stop.

467
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,881
I still won't tolerate this!

468
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,634
What do you mean, "won't tolerate"?

469
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,886
Hey! What are you doing?

470
00:30:48,179 --> 00:30:49,931
You are stealing from my daughter?

471
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,687
Have they caught George yet?

472
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:56,855
Not yet, madam.

473
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,356
But it won't take long.

474
00:30:58,773 --> 00:31:00,984
Most likely, tomorrow when you wake,

475
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,569
that woman will be in jail.

476
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,696
Good.

477
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:08,616
The obstacles in my estate
are gradually disappearing.

478
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,368
Two down.

479
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,412
But

480
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,373
it looks like Sam
will be staying here longer.

481
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:20,378
Some good things
are worth the wait, Amando.

482
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,673
You should rest, madam.

483
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,632
Auntie, it's just Mommy.

484
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:08,426
What of it?

485
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:11,471
Your daughter will be jailed.

486
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,181
Who's gonna use these?

487
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:15,350
So these are mine now!

488
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,476
You're so shameless!

489
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,685
- Give me that!
- Why?

490
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:19,812
Give me that. Ouch! What's with you?

491
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:21,940
- Are you a mad dog?
- Are you gonna stop or not?

492
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:23,858
- Come on. Let go of me!
- Let go of me!

493
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:26,694
Yes, I'm really a dog! I have rabies!

494
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,613
And I will bite you, so stop bothering me!

495
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:31,074
Hey you, you're really something else.

496
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:32,492
You have some nerve!

497
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:34,744
You are saying that
my daughter is a criminal.

498
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:37,705
But right now, who is the criminal here?
Who is the thief?

499
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,207
- So what?
- Mommy!

500
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:42,919
- So, you want this?
- Give it to me. Let go! You're so envious!

501
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,545
- Hey!
- Give me that!

502
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,589
- Mommy, let go!
- Give me that!

503
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:47,715
- You want this?
- Let it go!

504
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,467
- I got that first!
- Hey!

505
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:51,219
- Hey!
- Here, eat that!

506
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:54,138
Eat all of it! And I hope you choke on it!

507
00:33:17,286 --> 00:33:18,871
You've had this for five days?

508
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:21,040
- This is it?
- Yes, sir.

509
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:22,333
Why are there only 17?

510
00:33:22,417 --> 00:33:25,044
You stole Francis' morphine?

511
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,131
You put your brother in danger!

512
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,092
You're the reason he is in prison!

513
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,165
- You're really getting on my nerves!
- Stop!

514
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,750
Mother! Mother! Mother!

515
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:29,418
- That's enough, Mother.
- No, Ward!

516
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,839
- You're too much!
- She might sue you for this.

517
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:34,382
And why would you sue me?

518
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,092
You're the one who is stealing!

519
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:40,012
There it is! You might have swallowed it.
It's in your stomach!

520
00:35:40,096 --> 00:35:42,348
- Crazy!
- Mother, let it go! Let it go!

521
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:45,017
You're embarrassing!
Your mother is embarrassing!

522
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:46,227
This looks good on me!

523
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,355
Whatever! You're so cheap!

524
00:35:49,438 --> 00:35:52,066
You're so shameless! You call me cheap,
but you want to take it.

525
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:52,984
Please!

526
00:35:53,067 --> 00:35:54,193
Let it go!

527
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,695
Where is the other one?

528
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:57,071
Mommy!

529
00:35:57,155 --> 00:36:02,410
Do you know that you can go to jail
for up to 12 years for theft?

530
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:04,245
I am not a thief!

531
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:05,496
I'm just securing these.

532
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,165
Hey, you're such a liar.

533
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,833
You want to turn around and blame me?

534
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,626
Why, where is the jewelry?
With me or you?

535
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,627
- With you, right?
- Why not?

536
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:12,712
You want to steal them.

537
00:36:12,795 --> 00:36:14,547
- That's why I'm protecting them!
- Oh, whatever!

538
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,716
I know you want to get ahead of me!

539
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:18,634
- That's enough!
- You want to get ahead of me!

540
00:36:18,718 --> 00:36:20,303
That's enough!

541
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:22,388
- Ma, enough. You're getting carried away.
- That's enough!

542
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:23,931
- Mother, please!
- What?

543
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,099
That's enough!

544
00:36:26,225 --> 00:36:27,393
Let me go!

545
00:36:27,476 --> 00:36:28,769
- You want to get ahead of me!
- Sofia.

546
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,563
- I was the one who saw it first.
- What now?

547
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:32,523
What?

548
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,816
- Stop it.
- You're so shameless!

549
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,109
- You're worse!
- What?

550
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:38,738
- Stop it or I'll sue both of you!
- Let's go!

551
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,365
- Let it go.
- Sofia, take your mother out!

552
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:42,909
- Take her out!
- That serves you right!

553
00:36:42,992 --> 00:36:45,036
- Let it go.
- That's enough.

554
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,163
- Take her out! Take her out!
- Give me that!

555
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:48,748
I saw it first!

556
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:32,333
Ward, get your mother some water.

557
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,627
I don't want water!

558
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:37,755
I want to find my daughter!

559
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:40,883
I want to find George!

560
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,345
I'm already here.

561
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,722
I won't neglect you.

562
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:50,142
Why do you want to help us?

563
00:37:51,394 --> 00:37:53,562
We're not related to you.

564
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,857
Because George is the wife
of my best friend.

565
00:37:58,317 --> 00:38:01,362
I might have failed in protecting Basil,

566
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:05,116
but I'm not gonna fail his wife.

567
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,888
Sir, the SOCO team is here
and setting up.

568
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,726
Look for George.
I want her arrested right now.

569
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,979
Why do you think that it was Ms. Georgina
who killed Ms. Maison?

570
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,188
Envy!

571
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,192
She was envious because Beverly
was having a child when she couldn't.

572
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,361
You know what? This is a waste of time.

573
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:47,158
Just look for George
instead of asking me stupid questions!

574
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:52,288
Detective, can you leave us for a bit?

575
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,089
What are you doing here?

576
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:03,966
Ward called me.

577
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:08,137
So, you're here as the killer's lawyer.

578
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,099
We are not sure that it was George
who killed Beverly.

579
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:15,603
The evidence you found against her
is circumstantial.

580
00:39:19,482 --> 00:39:21,567
Let's be logical here for a minute.

581
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:24,320
I know you're grieving.

582
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:27,073
Don't assume how I'm feeling!

583
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:31,660
Because you don't know exactly
how I'm feeling right now.

584
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:37,249
You don't know the feeling of losing
a son, an in-law, and a grandchild!

585
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,920
Do you really think that George
would kill your grandchild?

586
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,672
Yes, she's hurt,

587
00:39:43,756 --> 00:39:46,509
but she knows how excited you are
to have a grandchild

588
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:48,969
and she wouldn't deprive you of that!

589
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:52,306
Why are you defending that woman?

590
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,100
You don't even know her!

591
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:58,312
Because Basil married her.

592
00:39:59,355 --> 00:40:03,526
If she's good enough for Basil,
she's good enough for me.

593
00:40:05,069 --> 00:40:07,988
Basil is a magnificent man.

594
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:12,076
I just don't trust his taste

595
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,622
when it comes to choosing a partner.

596
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,309
Ma…

597
00:40:37,393 --> 00:40:38,769
Are you following me?

598
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:44,275
I got curious when you walked by.

599
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,073
Where did you come from?

600
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,576
I went out.

601
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,416
I forgot the corkscrew.

602
00:41:05,504 --> 00:41:09,091
Well, I saw you carrying
two wine glasses earlier.

603
00:41:10,468 --> 00:41:12,011
Who are you drinking with?

604
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:16,807
Paco.

605
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,730
Paco?

606
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:24,315
Sam…

607
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,442
when I drink,

608
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:32,239
I sometimes imagine that
I'm drinking with my son, Paco.

609
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:36,911
It was our thing when he was alive.

610
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,288
So,

611
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:41,749
if you'll excuse me,

612
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:46,086
I would like to be alone
with my thoughts now.

613
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:48,714
Please.

614
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,562
If you were here,

615
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,273
I'd punch you in the face.

616
00:42:48,148 --> 00:42:51,485
You don't know how much trouble
you left behind for your family…

617
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:54,947
and me.

618
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,290
Sir Inigo, right?

619
00:43:04,373 --> 00:43:07,751
Sir Basil's best friend.

620
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:11,422
And you're his

621
00:43:12,214 --> 00:43:13,799
trusted staff.

622
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,384
You're Peter.

623
00:43:19,346 --> 00:43:23,434
Did he tell you something that…?

624
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:29,023
What do best friends tell each other?

625
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:33,652
They share secrets together.

626
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,323
Yeah. Okay.

627
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:52,504
Is Mr. Galvan Palacios here?

628
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,800
Sir, why?

629
00:43:57,926 --> 00:44:00,804
The body of a woman was found
in the river of Sitio Rosas.

630
00:44:01,513 --> 00:44:02,681
She jumped into the river.

631
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,101
She had no things or ID.

632
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:09,521
But based on the description,

633
00:44:09,605 --> 00:44:12,316
she's about the same age
as Ms. Georgina Palacios.

634
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:15,319
Have you found George?

635
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:16,987
I will go with you.

636
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:23,619
Let's identify her first.

637
00:44:24,286 --> 00:44:26,246
Identify?

638
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,542
Why? Can't George speak?

639
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,800
Why don't you just go with us?

640
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,968
What's happened to my daughter?

641
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,429
What's happened to George?

642
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,140
What's happened to George?

643
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:48,811
What's happened to George?

644
00:44:49,645 --> 00:44:52,189
What's happened to my daughter?

645
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,982
What?

646
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:10,791
I don't think…

647
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,127
I don't think I can do this.

648
00:45:14,336 --> 00:45:15,796
Okay.

649
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,257
I'll just check first.

650
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,304
I am her mother.

651
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,726
I should…

652
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:36,150
identify my daughter.

653
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,411
My child…

654
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,592
- Why do you look that way?
- What happened to you?

655
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,219
He got involved in a riot, ma'am.

656
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:47,387
Francis, are you okay?

657
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,805
I'm okay, Sam.

658
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,683
Actually, I'm already ready.
I'm ready to die.

659
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:55,145
Your sister and I will find a way.

660
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:58,273
Sir, maybe I can get my share?

661
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,942
Do you want to extort money from me?

662
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:02,402
- Sir, I need to pay for something.
- I said leave.

663
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,695
You don't want to leave?

664
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,240
Well, I don't want to see
your stupid face!

665
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:07,991
Are you stupid?

666
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,203
You mother of all gold diggers!

667
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:14,248
You even involved her. You should've
shown a little respect to Bev.

668
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,875
- Is that so, Vivian?
- Ma.

669
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:18,585
Ma, don't fight with her.

670
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:24,216
The murder happened around
6:55 p.m., and 7:00 p.m.

671
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:27,302
They have valid evidence
that disproves our claim.

672
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:28,971
Get out.

673
00:47:29,054 --> 00:47:30,097
NEXT EPISODE

674
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,723
All of you, get out!

675
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:35,185
Did you find a knife
in Ms. Beverly's things?

676
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,395
No, why?

677
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,606
Didn't Ms. Beverly ask for the knife
in the pig's head?

678
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:42,276
<i>Maybe that was used to kill her.</i>

679
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,111
Who disposed of the head of the pig?

680
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:45,862
Where is that person?
