1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:14,889
<i>You're an animal, Juliet.</i>

2
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,558
<i>You'll pay for what you did to me.</i>

3
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,059
That's what you deserve.

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,436
Why did you show yourself
to the Palacioses

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,729
without telling me?

6
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:22,480
I'm just carrying out our plan.

7
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:23,815
What will you get

8
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,400
if you find out about the past?

9
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,194
‪You cannot undo the past anymore.

10
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:30,155
‪Sam, what are you doing?

11
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:34,200
I heard that Basil's wife,
George, is pregnant.

12
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,619
Don't you ever hurt George.

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,954
Scary.

14
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,581
I know your family.

15
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,417
Tell me the truth.
Are you my father's mistress?

16
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,587
- Are you my father's mistress?
- Yes!

17
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:47,005
She ruined our family.

18
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:48,965
She destroyed your marriage.

19
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:51,718
I didn't ruin any relationship.

20
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,511
Before he met Mercy,

21
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:55,555
I was already part of your father's life.

22
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,265
He was mine first.

23
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,977
Why is that Juliet targeting my family?

24
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,145
Is she a former employee of the mines?

25
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,855
No, not her. It's her mother.

26
00:01:03,938 --> 00:01:05,648
Apparently, Manuella

27
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:08,276
was part of the group
that bombed the miners

28
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,611
who refused to join the movement.

29
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,196
She was caught, imprisoned,

30
00:01:11,279 --> 00:01:12,113
and died in jail.

31
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,823
That's why Juliet is seeking revenge?

32
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,158
Because of what happened to her mother?

33
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,493
Stop your delusion.

34
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:18,328
You seduced my father.

35
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,790
‪Go ahead. Ask your mom.

36
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:25,502
Your father mentioned a woman
to me before.

37
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:27,337
‪That was me.

38
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,214
Look for that Juliet.

39
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,675
Arrest all her accomplices.

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,553
She has something
to do with Basil getting poisoned.

41
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,971
We're also looking at that angle.

42
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:39,599
She needs to pay
for what she did to my family.

43
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:41,017
Even to Iñigo.

44
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,144
Why do you keep on saying

45
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:44,562
that man's name?

46
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:47,315
Is it my fault that I became his wife

47
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,400
- and not you?
- That's enough!

48
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,486
We're not done yet.

49
00:01:52,195 --> 00:01:54,823
PREVIOUSLY

50
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:07,085
Cheater.

51
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,295
Cheater.

52
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:11,714
What happened? Who is the cheater?

53
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:12,715
Mother.

54
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:15,301
Mother, that's enough.

55
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:17,137
Let's go inside.

56
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,181
I don't want to go inside Aurora's house.

57
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,433
That snake.

58
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:25,103
Who is the snake, Ma'am Aurora?

59
00:02:25,186 --> 00:02:26,312
Is it Aurora who fooled you?

60
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,856
Who did she steal? Was it Orly?

61
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,567
Orly, Mercy's husband?

62
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:32,861
Aurora was his mistress?

63
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,445
Please, don't add to it.

64
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:37,323
Well…

65
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,285
I understand why Orly fooled around.

66
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:41,452
Even Ma'am Aurora.

67
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,913
At least Aurora was richer,
more beautiful, and fresher,

68
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,415
not like…

69
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,708
Who?

70
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,460
Who, Ruth?

71
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,920
- What?
- Mom, please.

72
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:52,714
Go ahead with what you're about to say.

73
00:02:56,676 --> 00:02:59,429
Sarge, thank you for visiting.

74
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:03,725
I'm sorry about Ma'am George
and Uncle Galvan.

75
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,685
I thought I was the only one who noticed.

76
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,187
Why are they fighting
about Attorney Morales?

77
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,189
Ma'am George wants Iñigo

78
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,275
to be his friend,

79
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,360
but Uncle doesn't approve of him.

80
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,778
Did he say why?

81
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,908
The stories keep changing.

82
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,869
But, from what I know of Uncle Galvan,

83
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,746
He wouldn't be treating Iñigo that way

84
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:25,788
without a reason.

85
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,625
If you notice something different,
update me.

86
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:30,877
Especially with Attorney Morales.

87
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,505
At this point, you don't know
who is on your side.

88
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,966
The one you're calling an ally

89
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,593
may be Juliet's accomplice.

90
00:03:39,302 --> 00:03:40,762
- Okay, Sarge.
- Okay.

91
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,766
You have a lot of opinions.

92
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,059
Go ahead and talk.

93
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,310
Say it now.

94
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,311
- Mother, don't fight with her.
- Please. Let go of me, Mercy.

95
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:49,312
- It hurts.
- Come on.

96
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,689
Please, Mother. Stop it.

97
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,733
And you. You, Vivian.

98
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,902
Me? I have no comment.

99
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:56,819
Is there something you want to say?

100
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:58,488
No. No comment.

101
00:03:58,571 --> 00:03:59,447
It's Ruth.

102
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,658
She's the one with a lot of angst.

103
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,994
Ruth, you should understand me more

104
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,039
because we were both fooled
by our husbands.

105
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,374
What?

106
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:11,209
Just because I'm old,

107
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,795
I can be fooled?

108
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:18,841
Betrayal has nothing to do
with looks or age.

109
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,636
Let's go, Mother. Come on.

110
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,268
It's your fault.

111
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,028
Mother…

112
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,488
- Sit first.
- Samantha…

113
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,492
You were absent
from the security briefing.

114
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:48,496
Mother and I did something.

115
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,999
The manhunt operation for the suspect

116
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,501
of Beverly Maison's killer is
still ongoing.

117
00:04:54,335 --> 00:04:55,712
Please be extra careful

118
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,338
while the suspect is still at large.

119
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,591
How about my husband's mistress?

120
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,303
Can we have her imprisoned?

121
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,096
It depends on the case.

122
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:08,391
But, if that has nothing to do
with my investigation right now,

123
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:10,101
I can refer you to my colleague.

124
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:12,937
What if I tell you…

125
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,231
that Mom Aurora is my father's mistress,

126
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,692
and that it may have
a connection with his death.

127
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:22,322
It's your fault, Ruth.

128
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:25,408
You already saw that she was cheated on,

129
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,826
and then you were taunting her.

130
00:05:26,909 --> 00:05:28,536
Of course, she will fight with you.

131
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,747
That Mercy is really annoying.

132
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,459
You know Ruth, it just crossed my mind.

133
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:39,172
Aurora

134
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,174
stole Mercy's husband, right?

135
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,844
That's why Mercy stole your husband.

136
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,679
Exactly.

137
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,848
And she acts as if she's pitiful

138
00:05:48,931 --> 00:05:50,266
when she is a snake too.

139
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:53,019
True. You know silent people like her,

140
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:55,646
when they bite,

141
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,523
it's venomous.

142
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:59,317
That's why I hate people like her,

143
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,069
who steal your man.

144
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,737
Oh, my.

145
00:06:03,654 --> 00:06:04,989
But you know, Ruth…

146
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,159
I can…

147
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:10,620
I can help you with Mercy.

148
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:13,873
I mean I can help you seek revenge.

149
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:23,549
A week after he left us

150
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:24,759
for Mom Aurora,

151
00:06:24,842 --> 00:06:26,010
he suddenly died.

152
00:06:26,094 --> 00:06:27,261
Isn't that connected?

153
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,098
Your father's case
is already solved, Ms. Samantha.

154
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,767
But, if you want to open the investigation

155
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,602
of your father's death again,

156
00:06:34,685 --> 00:06:37,647
we need evidence
that there was really foul play

157
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,773
involved in his death.

158
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:41,442
That's the only time
we can reopen the case.

159
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,285
- Right?
- We'll gang up on Mercy?

160
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,248
- Yes.
- And then what?

161
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,125
She will be gone from our lives?

162
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,751
Possibly.

163
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,379
No thanks.

164
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,256
I'm not a killer. Maybe you are.

165
00:07:05,967 --> 00:07:07,593
Come on, Ruth.

166
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:10,263
I'm kidding.

167
00:07:10,346 --> 00:07:11,556
I'm just joking.

168
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,516
What's with you? I'm not a killer.

169
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,600
What do you think of me?

170
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,812
And besides, if she dies,

171
00:07:17,895 --> 00:07:21,399
what's Mercy's relevance to die?

172
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:23,151
Right? When she's nothing.

173
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,569
She's just a minion.

174
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:28,656
‪Gotcha.

175
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,531
Galvan.

176
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:12,116
Galvan…

177
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:15,411
Leave us first.

178
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:27,256
Galvan…

179
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,467
Sam's family knows the truth.

180
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,677
What truth?

181
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:34,472
The truth about you and Orly?

182
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,616
‪Why are you spying
‪on your father's mistress?

183
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:56,410
Do you already know?

184
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,829
‪Everybody knows.

185
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,000
Auntie Mercy's scene last night
has spread already.

186
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,460
She even fought Mom.

187
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:07,088
My mother has a right to get mad.

188
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,259
‪Life is so funny, no?

189
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,221
Of all the mothers-in-laws
you could have had,

190
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:19,100
you get your father's mistress.

191
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,769
‪Is that the reason

192
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,647
you pushed Paco off the cliff?

193
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,524
To get back at Auntie Aurora?

194
00:09:28,442 --> 00:09:31,487
Aurora, Aurora, Aurora.

195
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:36,284
I have been against your relationship
with that man for a long time.

196
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,911
It's your fault.

197
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,538
You always close your ears

198
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,415
whenever I give you advice.

199
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,088
‪And you, you, you.

200
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:53,593
‪You always made yourself available
‪to that man.

201
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:55,136
Please, Galvan.

202
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,554
Don't scold me anymore.

203
00:09:56,637 --> 00:09:58,472
‪Help me fix this.

204
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:01,017
Sam is investigating.

205
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,810
‪So…

206
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:04,604
‪let her.

207
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:07,315
What if…

208
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:11,527
What if she finds out
what really happened to Orly?

209
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,155
I just found out now about the affair.

210
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,784
So, will we seek revenge on her?

211
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,454
‪Are you going to attempt
‪to kill Auntie Aurora

212
00:10:21,537 --> 00:10:24,415
‪the way you attempted
‪to kill me and my baby?

213
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,334
George, please stop picking on me.

214
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:27,418
Because if not…

215
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:29,003
What will you do?

216
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,048
I will cut your tongue.

217
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,095
‪Come near me,
‪and I will rake you to death.

218
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:45,645
Sam. George.

219
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,564
Stop that. Stop it. Give me that.

220
00:10:50,566 --> 00:10:51,567
Sam…

221
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,611
We have a bigger problem.

222
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:59,700
‪Waring will not solve your problem.

223
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:02,912
‪So, tell me what to do, Galvan.

224
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:04,705
‪If things go wrong…

225
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,916
‪blame everything on Paco.

226
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,753
Tell them that it was Paco
who killed Orly.

227
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:13,589
They can no longer imprison

228
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,424
a person who is already dead.

229
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,134
‪No.

230
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,431
I will not tarnish my son's name.

231
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,017
Your son is already dead, Aurora.

232
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,645
‪What's the worst thing
‪that would happen to him?

233
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,855
Is there no other option?

234
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:32,942
Galvan…

235
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,528
We still haven't gotten justice

236
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,530
for Paco's death.

237
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,365
And now…

238
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,785
Now, you want him to be the bad guy?

239
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:46,414
Paco is the only scapegoat
that I can see now.

240
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:49,875
‪Besides…

241
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:52,711
‪he really did try to kill Orly.

242
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,047
‪Remember?

243
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,817
Vin, please leave it there

244
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,360
and then wait for me downstairs.

245
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,278
‪Yes, Ma'am.

246
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,530
Thank you.

247
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:23,325
Sir, keep a close eye on George,

248
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,745
since the Palacios killer
has not been caught yet.

249
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:28,164
‪Yes, sir.

250
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:29,165
Thank you very much.

251
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:30,666
‪Yes, sir.

252
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,544
- Thank you.
- Okay.

253
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,425
George, thanks so much for this.
You went out of your way.

254
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,595
I notice that all you eat

255
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,430
is hospital food.

256
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:47,433
No one else visits you here?

257
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:52,855
‪The secretary sent me some… cupcakes.

258
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,899
How about your siblings?

259
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,525
‪The only child.

260
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,527
How about your parents?

261
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,739
They've been gone for a long time.

262
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,410
My mother had a heart attack when…

263
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,621
When what?

264
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,084
Mother?

265
00:13:14,752 --> 00:13:16,712
There you go, Sam. Talk to Mom.

266
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:18,464
Mother, no one is leaving.

267
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,840
Mother, stop this.

268
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,383
If you want to stay, you can stay.

269
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,426
But, I will leave.

270
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,261
I don't want to stay under the same roof

271
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,763
with that snake, Aurora.

272
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:26,847
And then what, Mother?

273
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,766
She will just get away from all her sins?

274
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:29,934
That's it?

275
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,101
Mother, she needs to pay for all her sins

276
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:32,478
against us.

277
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:34,021
Mother, now that we have proven

278
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,481
that she was Dad's mistress,

279
00:13:35,564 --> 00:13:37,566
that means Paco had a reason

280
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:38,859
to get mad at him.

281
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,194
Think about it, Mother.

282
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,404
Mother, he may have been against
their relationship.

283
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,406
That's why he killed Dad.

284
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,033
It's possible that it was him
who gave Dad the drugs.

285
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,619
Those are all suspicions.

286
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:51,163
Sarge said if you want
to reopen the investigation

287
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:52,248
about your father,

288
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:54,667
you need to present evidence.

289
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:58,712
I know someone who can help us.

290
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,555
When what?

291
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,807
When Dad was imprisoned.

292
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,435
‪I'm sorry. I don't know.

293
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,563
‪You don't need to say sorry.

294
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,065
‪It's not even your fault.

295
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:24,321
‪It wasn't his fault either.

296
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,784
He was just framed…

297
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:31,704
by his enemies.

298
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:34,456
Is that the reason you became a lawyer?

299
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:40,671
Everything I do is for my parents.

300
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:43,883
If I failed to save them before,

301
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:46,886
maybe now…

302
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,722
I can save someone.

303
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,694
Cairo, why is the scaffolding still there?

304
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,905
Are they still not finished
with what they are doing there?

305
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,075
Sir, it's because…

306
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,287
they just finished installing the lights.

307
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,080
They can't remove it
because they are waiting

308
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,874
for the supplier of the CCTV.

309
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,960
Tell them to hurry.

310
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:22,588
Hi, Uncle Galvan.

311
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,257
I brought you cake.

312
00:15:29,595 --> 00:15:31,347
Cairo please bring this inside

313
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,057
so they can eat it later.

314
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,224
Thank you.

315
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,146
Be honest with me.

316
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,859
You didn't come here with a cake

317
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:46,028
just to say hello?

318
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,243
Do you need something?

319
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,245
‪What is it?

320
00:15:58,624 --> 00:15:59,750
What do you know

321
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,669
about my father's death?

322
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,674
Do we have a flat tire?

323
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,385
Ma'am two tires got flat.

324
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,512
We only have one spare tire.

325
00:16:12,137 --> 00:16:13,889
We can't leave.

326
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:14,890
How can we go home?

327
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,725
I already called Cairo.

328
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:20,187
Okay. I'll just go
to the washroom for a while.

329
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,355
Just wait for him in the lobby.

330
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:22,731
Okay, Ma'am.

331
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,871
George is your weakness.

332
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:40,791
Because of a woman,

333
00:16:40,874 --> 00:16:42,960
you turned your back on our mission.

334
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,005
That George Palacios
should be ready for me.

335
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:48,590
She's my next target.

336
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,591
Juliet?

337
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:40,184
Don't come near me.

338
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:41,894
Don't come near me.

339
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,062
‪Guard.

340
00:17:45,314 --> 00:17:46,148
‪Guard.

341
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:51,445
I don't know anything
about what you're saying.

342
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,239
Mom Aurora came here

343
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,116
after she admitted to us

344
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,993
about her affair with my father.

345
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,453
‪So…

346
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,998
Aurora always visits me.

347
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,209
We siblings are close.

348
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:06,710
‪Exactly.

349
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,254
That's why you know about the affair…

350
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:10,964
and how after a week,

351
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,092
my father left us.

352
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,635
He mysteriously died.

353
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,263
Cairo. Cairo.

354
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,312
Sam. Do you need anything?

355
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:27,731
‪Help me get inside.

356
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:31,568
You still haven't answered my question.

357
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,488
‪I have nothing else to say to you.

358
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,365
Let's go, Sofia.

359
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,792
‪Guard.

360
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,634
- Guard. It's Juliet.
- Sarge.

361
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,970
Sarge, it's Juliet.
She's running over there.

362
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:03,892
Good thing you arrived.

363
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:08,814
Sergeant Royales and I were
supposed to visit Iñigo.

364
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:10,941
Good thing we arrived
before you got stabbed.

365
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,571
Sergeant Royales called me.

366
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,865
He suspects that Juliet might come back

367
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,616
to the ancestral house,

368
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,410
or to Iñigo to kill him.

369
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:23,871
That's why we're here to check

370
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,706
if she'll show up again.

371
00:19:27,457 --> 00:19:31,128
It seems Juliet really
plans to kill Iñigo.

372
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,422
But, why?

373
00:19:34,089 --> 00:19:35,549
He's not a Palacios.

374
00:19:38,051 --> 00:19:40,971
How sure are you
that Iñigo is trustworthy?

375
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,975
And why does Juliet want to kill him?

376
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,154
Sofia!

377
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,174
‪What do you mean?

378
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,508
Iñigo is my friend.

379
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,427
He's my husband's best friend.

380
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,305
But, Uncle Galvan doesn't like him, right?

381
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,766
Didn't you think
that there's a possible reason

382
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:27,768
why Uncle doesn't want you to be near

383
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,852
that guy?

384
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,688
What's the reason?

385
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:32,898
When Dad and I talked

386
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:36,443
he couldn't give a clear reason.

387
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,074
George, Jericho…

388
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,913
The CCTV camera captured
Juliet Gambao leaving.

389
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,331
She's no longer here in the hospital.

390
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,208
‪Oh. Thank God.

391
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:52,542
And I already asked some policemen

392
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,461
to guard the vicinity.

393
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,713
Juliet may be just hiding within the area.

394
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:05,180
Sir, what happened?

395
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,431
Tell the contractor

396
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,976
that we were almost
in danger because of that.

397
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,436
We're okay, Cairo.

398
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,105
Daddy and I almost got into an accident.

399
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,482
‪If it weren't for Aunt Sam

400
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:16,733
‪Dad might be dead.

401
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,194
That's okay, Sofia.

402
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,988
Families are like that.

403
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,657
They help each other.

404
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:25,909
Sam…

405
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,913
If there's a way for us
to return the favor,

406
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,248
‪please tell us.

407
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:40,090
Sir, the taxi driver dropped off
the suspect over there,

408
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:41,758
in that apartment.

409
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:43,218
When we called,

410
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,178
the suspect went inside that apartment.

411
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:47,472
Let's surround the area.

412
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,684
Yes, dear. I'll go home there.

413
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:52,477
I'll let things cool off there.

414
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,650
Juliet Gamboa!

415
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:10,037
‪Juliet Gamboa, you're under arrest.

416
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:21,631
You really won't stop bothering me

417
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,675
until you get what you want.

418
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,344
Do you want to make it up?

419
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,305
I want to know the truth.

420
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,058
I know Dad, he's not an addict.

421
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:33,643
He did not commit suicide
like they all said.

422
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,687
‪Sam, believe it or not…

423
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:38,899
I was also surprised

424
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:41,026
when I learned that he committed suicide.

425
00:22:41,109 --> 00:22:42,152
‪All I know is…

426
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,446
‪he was in a lot of pain that time.

427
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,866
‪Pain? What do you mean pain?

428
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,662
How's your wound?

429
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,624
Do you already have a lawyer?

430
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,711
If you don't, we can get you one.

431
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,005
I don't need a lawyer.

432
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,632
What do you need?

433
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,592
Justice.

434
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,427
Justice?

435
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,347
For killing Beverly Maison?

436
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,230
Justice for all the people
the Palacioses stepped on and killed.

437
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:23,235
Days before he committed suicide,

438
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,277
I bumped into him.

439
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:26,530
‪I remember…

440
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,698
‪that was March 10.

441
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:33,120
<i>I was on my way home</i>
<i>from the ambassador's party</i>

442
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,746
<i>when I saw him.</i>

443
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,997
<i>He was limping</i>

444
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,624
<i>and trying to escape from someone.</i>

445
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:40,502
Dr. Orly.

446
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,546
Help me.

447
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,047
‪Who did this to you?

448
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:45,507
It was Paco.

449
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,177
He ran me over. Help me escape from here.

450
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,428
He will kill me.

451
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,722
Let's go. Let's go.

452
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:01,148
The suspect tried to hurt you?

453
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:02,607
Hey…

454
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,027
Your wound. Just relax.

455
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:07,571
She wasn't able to go near me.

456
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,781
Jericho arrived right away.

457
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,074
Even though.

458
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,451
You should be careful.
You shouldn't be alone.

459
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:15,287
Yes.

460
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,122
I will be extra careful.

461
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:20,167
Sergeant Royales' theory

462
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,128
is that the suspect has an accomplice.

463
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:24,671
Accomplice?

464
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,215
Who?

465
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,554
Paco tried to run him over?

466
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:36,224
Why?

467
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:37,851
Did they fight?

468
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,978
I don't know.

469
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:42,647
What do you mean you don't know?
You didn't ask?

470
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:43,899
You weren't surprised

471
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:45,442
that your nephew would run someone over?

472
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,319
‪I asked your father,

473
00:24:48,445 --> 00:24:49,779
but he refused to talk.

474
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,407
‪Then I asked Aurora what happened.

475
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:53,867
‪She told me…

476
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,578
‪there was just a misunderstanding

477
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:57,495
‪with Paco,

478
00:24:57,996 --> 00:24:59,039
‪and Doc Orly.

479
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,668
Is she the reason

480
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:05,921
you're seeking revenge on the Palacioses?

481
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,257
Your mother was jailed

482
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,176
because she bombed her fellow miners

483
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,595
who didn't join the strike.

484
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,723
It wasn't my mother who bombed them.

485
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:18,183
Who?

486
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,518
The Palacioses.

487
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:24,773
I supposed Paco
was against their relationship.

488
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:27,943
‪No one in the family approved of it.

489
00:25:29,653 --> 00:25:31,738
Is that what you were talking
about in the library

490
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:33,240
when I heard you?

491
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,992
Will you cover up for Paco again?

492
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,995
Just like how you covered up
for him for what he did to Dr. Orly.

493
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:42,415
‪Don't you ever mention that doctor again.

494
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:46,002
Why? Because you are scared
that they will find out the truth?

495
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:49,631
I thought your father would
report to the police,

496
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,008
but he wasn't able to do it.

497
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,678
‪They suffered an incident.

498
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:56,638
‪I go a call from Aurora.

499
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,474
Orly is gone.

500
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:00,642
He committed suicide.

501
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,312
He committed suicide or he was killed?

502
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,025
Do they know who the accomplice is?

503
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:11,820
Not yet.

504
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,571
They are still trying to find out.

505
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:17,492
What else did they say?

506
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,787
The accomplice helped Juliet

507
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,831
get inside the estate.

508
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,333
And that's why no one noticed

509
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,544
when she attacked Beverly.

510
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:30,547
I wonder who the accomplice is?

511
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,007
Do you have a hunch?

512
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,259
Why did you show yourself
to the Palacioses

513
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,802
without telling me?

514
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,762
I'm just carrying out our plan.

515
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:43,226
Paco didn't succeed in killing my father.

516
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,186
That's why she helped him.

517
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,163
Why would they hurt their miners?

518
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:05,123
From what I know,

519
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:07,250
those who got hurt

520
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,586
are the ones who didn't join the strike.

521
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,463
They were on the management side.

522
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,758
That's why the Palacioses killed them.

523
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,260
So the people would get mad

524
00:27:17,344 --> 00:27:18,970
at those who were on strike.

525
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,557
So the Palacioses would look like
the aggrieved party.

526
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,977
While the people fighting
their corrupt ways

527
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,437
would look like the bad ones.

528
00:27:29,397 --> 00:27:30,607
You don't want anomalies?

529
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,323
But, why did you kill Beverly Maison?

530
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,075
And you even involved her innocent child.

531
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,248
Paco tried to run Dad over?

532
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,585
That happened March 10
according to Uncle Galvan.

533
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,091
But, the police called us on March 19.

534
00:27:56,716 --> 00:27:58,676
Dad had been dead
for several days already.

535
00:28:00,512 --> 00:28:01,471
It's confusing.

536
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:02,764
What if we do a timeline, Sam?

537
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,350
Let's write it down.

538
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:10,438
Is there a paper somewhere?

539
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:11,898
None.

540
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:13,233
There's nothing here.

541
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:16,361
Here.

542
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:18,571
What is this?

543
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,365
Wait, let's take this out.

544
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,520
This is Paco's.

545
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,896
It's Paco's?

546
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:58,778
Galvan…

547
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:00,905
‪What did you tell Sam?

548
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:03,616
I saw you talking earlier.

549
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,493
What did you talk about?

550
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,009
It says here,

551
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,220
he went to Hong Kong on March 11,

552
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,056
and came back on March 20.

553
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,022
‪I told her about our plan.

554
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:36,024
‪Which is?

555
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,692
‪Put the blame on Paco.

556
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:41,196
He did run over Dr. Orly.

557
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,367
‪Aurora, it's easier to believe

558
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,621
that Paco has something to do
with Orly's death.

559
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:58,004
So, it means he wasn't here when Dad died.

560
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,188
But, he wasn't the one who killed him.

561
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,065
‪My son

562
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,275
‪is a good person, Galvan.

563
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,111
‪He is not capable of killing anyone.

564
00:30:22,195 --> 00:30:23,738
What would you prefer?

565
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,367
Let the truth about
what really happened come out?

566
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,702
You're not the only one
who will be involved.

567
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,996
‪If the truth comes out,

568
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,499
we will all be responsible.

569
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,043
‪That might be the end
‪of the Palacios name.

570
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,769
<i>‪I did not kill Doc Orly.</i>

571
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,229
<i>‪No one did.</i>

572
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,398
‪Because your father killed himself.

573
00:30:58,481 --> 00:30:59,941
You killed Dad.

574
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:01,818
I will spread this to the press
and social media.

575
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,361
- I will destroy you.
- Don't do it.

576
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:04,362
I will kill myself.

577
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:06,823
I will jump and I will bring you with me.

578
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,283
Let go of me.

579
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:15,915
There's no innocent Palacios.

580
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,418
Beverly's child

581
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,628
will grow up a demon.

582
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:25,717
He will also hurt and oppress others.

583
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,260
So, it's better that,

584
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,345
even if he hasn't been born yet,

585
00:31:30,013 --> 00:31:31,723
he is gone.

586
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:35,184
You're no different
to the people you hate.

587
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:38,396
Why are you on their side?

588
00:31:39,439 --> 00:31:42,525
You don't know how evil
the Palacioses are.

589
00:31:49,073 --> 00:31:50,325
Jericho…

590
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,747
Sergeant Royales sent a text message.

591
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,874
The suspect who killed Beverly
has been caught.

592
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,460
Where did they catch her?

593
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:02,921
The details are not yet clear.

594
00:32:03,504 --> 00:32:04,505
But, he said the suspect

595
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:07,258
is already in the police station
and being interrogated.

596
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:11,429
I hope she admits everything,

597
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,514
including who her accomplice is.

598
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,602
Sam…

599
00:32:21,105 --> 00:32:22,065
Francis…

600
00:32:24,567 --> 00:32:26,819
If you came here to convince me

601
00:32:27,862 --> 00:32:30,073
to continue with
the investigation, let's stop.

602
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,869
Maybe they are all correct.

603
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,040
Dad is already dead.

604
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,416
There's no point.

605
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,253
Our obsession with closure

606
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:45,922
‪is doing more harm than good.

607
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,717
But, Sam. We want closure, right?

608
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:52,470
‪At what cost?

609
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,600
Francis, Paco died…

610
00:32:59,852 --> 00:33:02,689
‪because I blamed him
‪for a crime he didn't commit.

611
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:10,780
Who is helping you sneak
into the Palacios estate?

612
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,410
No one.

613
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:18,788
I'm all alone.

614
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,498
What do you mean by no one?
That's impossible.

615
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,251
You passed through the secret tunnel.

616
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,336
Only a few people from the estate

617
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,671
know about that passageway.

618
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:30,508
Who helped you?

619
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,264
I will go there directly.

620
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:38,933
I'll go with you.

621
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,101
You can't.

622
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,769
The doctor hasn't cleared you yet.

623
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,856
I want to see the person who stabbed me.

624
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,157
Sam, if it wasn't Paco,

625
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,659
I'm sure someone did this to Dad.

626
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,578
Who?

627
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,707
Who else will we accuse?

628
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,126
Who else are we going to involve?

629
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,587
How many people should we blame?

630
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:12,008
Francis, I lost my husband.

631
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,432
Maybe we should just accept…

632
00:34:23,352 --> 00:34:25,438
that maybe Dad changed.

633
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,482
Maybe Dad was an addict.

634
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,901
Maybe he didn't love us.

635
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,321
Sam, that's not true.

636
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,324
Dad loved us.

637
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,744
He was supposed to come back to us.

638
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,586
I saw this among Paco's things.

639
00:34:58,387 --> 00:35:00,139
MY CHILDREN, WAIT FOR MY RETURN.
DAD.

640
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:33,589
Paco…

641
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:38,719
Thank God. You answered my call.

642
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,637
‪Come home.

643
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,306
Let's talk about this mess, Paco.

644
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:47,061
I can't take it
that you're far away from me.

645
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,522
It's over, Paco. Orly and I broke up.

646
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,567
Paco?

647
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:53,734
Paco…

648
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,882
Madam?

649
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:22,096
Dr. Orly is gone.

650
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,558
He is dead.

651
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,423
I know you're not alone.

652
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,717
You have an accomplice.

653
00:37:00,927 --> 00:37:02,053
Who is your accomplice?

654
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,973
Okay.

655
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:08,351
‪I can cut you a deal.

656
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:10,728
You can be a state witness.

657
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:13,689
Just tell us who helped you.

658
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,236
I will not go to jail?

659
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,987
We will find a way,

660
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,740
as long as you cooperate with us.

661
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:43,427
I want to say sorry.

662
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,307
‪Sorry for what?

663
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,104
‪For blaming Paco
‪for the death of my father.

664
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,066
Do we know him?

665
00:37:58,192 --> 00:37:59,652
Is he a Palacios?

666
00:38:03,155 --> 00:38:04,240
He is not a Palacios.

667
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:06,784
But, they know him?

668
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,579
Who?

669
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,208
It's the attorney.

670
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:16,210
Attorney?

671
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:18,629
It's Iñigo…

672
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:20,881
Iñigo Morales.

673
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:25,553
He ordered me to kill Beverly.

674
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:30,099
And he also killed Peter Pambid.

675
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,532
‪I found this.

676
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:52,246
‪He wasn't even here when it happened.

677
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,667
‪My son is not perfect.

678
00:38:57,918 --> 00:38:59,837
‪But, he would never…

679
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:02,548
‪kill another soul…

680
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,591
‪Samantha.

681
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,593
‪I'm sorry.

682
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,888
I let my anger devour me.

683
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,850
I blamed him for everything.

684
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:22,610
‪I'm really sorry, Sam.

685
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:26,864
‪It's just that you have
‪to accept the truth.

686
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,950
‪That your father…

687
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:31,410
‪committed suicide…

688
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,830
‪by overdosing from heroin.

689
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,958
My father did not commit suicide.

690
00:39:38,834 --> 00:39:39,752
Sam…

691
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,677
I saw this, among Paco's things.

692
00:39:48,761 --> 00:39:49,678
‪MY CHILDREN, WAIT FOR MY RETURN.
‪DAD.

693
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:52,181
"My children…

694
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,892
wait for my return.

695
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:57,686
Dad."

696
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,230
‪So?

697
00:40:00,314 --> 00:40:03,984
No person who is going
to commit suicide would buy a gift.

698
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:06,821
Wrap the gifts
so he could give them to us.

699
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,323
It's possible that he changed his mind.

700
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,825
‪Or, maybe…

701
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,621
‪someone stopped him
‪from coming home to us.

702
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,540
‪What?

703
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,709
It wasn't Paco who killed my father…

704
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:23,754
‪because he wasn't here when it happened.

705
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,257
‪But, you…

706
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,634
‪You were here.

707
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,722
Do you have something to do
with my father's death?

708
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:36,684
‪No.

709
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,897
Was it you who killed my father…

710
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,693
so he wouldn't come back to us?

711
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,158
He is not really Iñigo Morales.

712
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,660
His real name is Antonio Beringuela.

713
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,245
<i>If that Juliet has an accomplice,</i>

714
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,539
I'm sure he'll get back
at the Palacioses, especially you.

715
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,583
‪-I'm safe.
‪-But, you're safer with me.

716
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,042
<i>The son of José Beringuela</i>

717
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:05,337
who the Palacios siblings betrayed
and had him jailed.

718
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,589
<i>Why don't you come with me?</i>

719
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,756
<i>Let's go to a faraway place.</i>

720
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,467
‪I'm considering your offer.

721
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,385
I have solid evidence of our connivance.

722
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,345
‪These are four tickets to Singapore

723
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,890
for their wedding anniversary with Mother.

724
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,016
She chose to come back to us.

725
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,101
Orly already said goodbye to Mercy.

726
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:21,437
<i>There's no problem if someone courts you,</i>

727
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,397
but not Iñigo.

728
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:24,899
What's the problem with the both of you?

729
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:25,983
He seduced Basil.

730
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,359
Iñigo is gay!

731
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:28,944
<i>Come with us to the police station.</i>

732
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:30,571
- Ms. Georgina.
- You should be in jail.

733
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,572
Stay away from Attorney Morales.

734
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,073
He is one of the Palacios killers.

735
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,950
Let's continue our relationship,

736
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,702
but we can't let Paco know.
