1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,052
<i>Why are you hugging my niece?</i>

2
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,263
Is something going on
between the two of you?

3
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:56,264
He's my best friend!

4
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,807
Auntie…

5
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,435
Uncle, please, no, don't hurt Jerico.

6
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:02,520
Auntie, please.
He's just like a brother to me.

7
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,731
- Beat him up!
- Jerico!

8
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,441
- Rebecca, stop!
- No!

9
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:08,943
<i>I told Louie about what happened to Sam,</i>

10
00:01:09,027 --> 00:01:12,155
<i>and they want to help find out</i>
<i>who set her up.</i>

11
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,617
- I'll pass on that.
- Don't you want to know who set up Sam?

12
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,203
Okay, I'll join the investigation
of the Crimebusters.

13
00:01:18,286 --> 00:01:20,497
Stay away from the help, Rebecca.

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:24,000
Not Jerico. He is just like
a brother to me.

15
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,670
But just one hint that Jerico
is interested in you,

16
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,214
and I will kick him out.

17
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:31,132
<i>Don't worry about Angie, okay?</i>

18
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,218
<i>I've already found a replacement for her.</i>

19
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:35,845
Ma'am Rebecca, this is Loray,
your new nanny.

20
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,389
<i>What am I? Five?</i>

21
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,809
She's our new driver, Rochelle.

22
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,268
I prefer Rico.

23
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,062
Just call me Rico.

24
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,648
<i>Sir Paco hasn't been dead</i>
<i>even 40 days yet,</i>

25
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,525
<i>and we're already holding</i>
<i>a novena for Sir Basil.</i>

26
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:49,943
<i>Then we also have Ms. Beverly.</i>

27
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:53,029
The Palacios men are dying one by one.

28
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,240
Paco, Basil, and my grandson.

29
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,367
<i>- All of them are gone.</i>
<i>- Sir, there's one left.</i>

30
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,410
- There's still one more.
- What are you saying?

31
00:01:59,494 --> 00:02:04,415
Sir Rodolfo had a child with…

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,543
Jessica Clarito.

33
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:08,711
- Do you know who?
- Yes.

34
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:09,963
Yes, Attorney.

35
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,465
I'm looking for evidence against Jerico.

36
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:15,260
PREVIOUSLY

37
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,143
So how will we find out who set up Sam?

38
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:25,562
They say he could be the killer.

39
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,690
And because we've already found
the murder weapon,

40
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,942
we just need to look for the hoodie
and the gloves.

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,819
Here.

42
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,779
Use this to look for evidence.

43
00:02:39,534 --> 00:02:40,660
Ward.

44
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,581
So what now?

45
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,624
On three.

46
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:49,586
One, two, three!

47
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,170
Crimebusters!

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,926
Let's go!

49
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:18,990
Sam?

50
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,161
What are you doing here?

51
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:51,439
When a righteous person dies,

52
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,400
no one understands and no one intervenes.

53
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,279
But he is taken
to save him from destruction.

54
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:02,325
The life of a person who walks
in righteousness is peaceful

55
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:04,244
even if they die.

56
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:09,332
Let's take to heart and keep in mind
what is stated in the Book of Isaiah

57
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:14,045
because this is the only way
to achieve true happiness

58
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:16,005
and eternal life.

59
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,468
May the peace of the Lord Jesus Christ
be with you all.

60
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:25,723
In the name of the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit. Amen.

61
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:36,442
That's right. I forgot.

62
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,279
Excuse me, Uncle.

63
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:40,655
Love, restroom, please?

64
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:43,574
Down the hall, to your left.
The powder room is there.

65
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,285
Thank you. Excuse me.

66
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,457
Who is she?

67
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:55,044
A Lopez? A Royales?

68
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:00,341
A Balay.

69
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,135
A what?

70
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,555
Don't tell me she's a nobody.

71
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:08,850
What does it matter
what family she's from?

72
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:13,688
Once I marry this woman,
she'll be a Palacios.

73
00:05:13,771 --> 00:05:16,524
Our children will be a Palacios.

74
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,359
So why does it matter?
Isn't this what you wanted?

75
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,986
Of course it would matter to me!

76
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,155
Most especially to your Auntie Aurora!

77
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,701
You're a Palacios, for God's sake!

78
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,662
- You should be marrying someone who's…
- I should be marrying who?

79
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,372
Tell me.

80
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,415
Who?

81
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,043
I am not like you.

82
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,253
I don't follow the orders of this family.

83
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:40,339
I make my own decisions.

84
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:44,135
So you either accept this woman
as your daughter-in-law,

85
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:45,511
and our children,

86
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:48,890
or you could find your gun
and shoot me right now.

87
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,768
He really does love me.

88
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:06,908
I lost a son…

89
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,620
and a grandson.

90
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:16,167
No words can describe
the depths of my grief.

91
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,879
But moments ago,
I found a reason to smile.

92
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:26,803
It's no coincidence that we celebrated
my older brother Rodolfo's birthday

93
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,472
along with Basil's novena

94
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,851
because today, I have been introduced

95
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:35,353
to Rodolfo's child.

96
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:41,734
Yes.

97
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:47,240
I just learned earlier that
Rodolfo had a son

98
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:50,326
with his former girlfriend Jessica.

99
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:00,086
Oh my God, Jerico.

100
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:04,340
Peter's told Uncle Galvan that
you are a Palacios.

101
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:11,806
And here's right now with us.

102
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,228
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome

103
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,148
my nephew…

104
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,403
Peter Palacios.

105
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,697
What?

106
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,908
What?

107
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,698
You're the son of Rodolfo and Jessica?

108
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,367
Yes, sir.

109
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:18,331
I've been wanting to tell you this
for a long time, but…

110
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,793
I was scared that you might not accept me.

111
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,759
Tell me everything.

112
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,501
Come on, Peter.

113
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,919
Come.

114
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,979
So, Peter is a Palacios.

115
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,815
That explains why he had a lot to say
about wealth earlier.

116
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,400
Because he's a Palacios.

117
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,778
As for me, I am happy.
I have a millionaire friend.

118
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:32,196
It's okay to become a Palacios.

119
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,448
Their driver becomes a boss.

120
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:41,789
What craziness is this?

121
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,583
Aurora.

122
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,252
Listen to him first.

123
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,336
Let him talk.

124
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,756
Go ahead, Peter.

125
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,433
It's true, Ma'am Aurora.

126
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:07,231
I am the son of Rodolfo and Jessica…

127
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,485
your former secretary who…

128
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,864
Go ahead. Tell them everything.

129
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:22,204
The woman you sent to jail
when you found out

130
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,917
that she was having a relationship
with my father, Rodolfo.

131
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,419
But…

132
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,173
Papa helped Mama escape
before she could get arrested,

133
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:33,215
and…

134
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,301
he hid her in Isabela.

135
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:38,220
Until Mama got pregnant.

136
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:41,515
Mama told me that

137
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:46,270
I was just a year old
when Papa suddenly disappeared.

138
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,981
During their last conversation…

139
00:10:50,858 --> 00:10:52,401
Papa said that…

140
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,112
He needed to protect us.

141
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,368
Mama didn't tell me that…

142
00:11:01,702 --> 00:11:04,038
I was the son of Rodolfo Palacios

143
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,791
because…

144
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,585
because she knew that
I would look for him.

145
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:15,466
So Mama told me that Papa
was already dead.

146
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,137
But before he died…

147
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:22,765
…she told me who my real father was.

148
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:28,020
…she told me who my real father was.

149
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,313
No!

150
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:34,902
Anyone can make up that trash story.

151
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,946
I will not accept you.

152
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:39,031
I will never accept you!

153
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,411
You are not and will never be a Palacios!

154
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,620
No, Aurora.

155
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,040
Until the DNA proves it.

156
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,794
Galvan…

157
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,003
- What?
- Friends.

158
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,922
Thank you all for coming.

159
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,883
We appreciate your presence here.

160
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:00,970
Thank you.

161
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:02,847
Let's go, Peter.

162
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,515
- Let's talk first, okay?
- All right.

163
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,684
Peter! Peter!

164
00:12:08,602 --> 00:12:09,895
Peter!

165
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:13,983
All right. Go ahead and talk to him.

166
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,986
But pack your things
and come to the house.

167
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,195
Yes, sir.

168
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,699
You're a Palacios?

169
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:23,868
Why didn't you tell us?

170
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,870
His roommate gets to talk to him first.

171
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,881
You are investigating?

172
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:40,509
Yes.

173
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,304
We want to help, Sam.

174
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,521
You too, Ward?

175
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:56,942
Isn't your sister suspecting me?

176
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:06,368
Aurora, what's the problem?

177
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,915
You let a helper fool you
in front of our friends

178
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,501
and in front of the other helpers!

179
00:13:13,584 --> 00:13:16,629
Didn't you hear Peter's story?

180
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:18,422
The story about Jessica?

181
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:19,715
He didn't just make it up.

182
00:13:19,798 --> 00:13:22,593
That means he is telling the truth.

183
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:23,844
Oh, come on.

184
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:29,767
Galvan, that story was popular
even during pocketbook days.

185
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:32,645
That's why we'll have his DNA tested.

186
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:33,812
No!

187
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:37,733
We will not have
that opportunist's DNA tested.

188
00:13:37,816 --> 00:13:39,777
Such a waste of time!

189
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:42,196
Then it's my time I will waste.

190
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,282
Don't you feel any shame
for your son, Basil?

191
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:50,204
His body hasn't even rotted in his grave,
and you're already replacing him!

192
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,122
That is exactly my point!

193
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,626
I lost a son, Aurora.

194
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:59,004
I won't let this opportunity pass!

195
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:03,634
This opportunity
to be a father to my nephew!

196
00:14:06,845 --> 00:14:08,138
Peter!

197
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:09,473
Peter, wait a second.

198
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,059
What?

199
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,311
You fool! You're such an animal!

200
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,231
You're pretending to be me
in front of Sir Galvan?

201
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:20,067
Bro, I'm sorry.

202
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,444
I'm in dire need of money.

203
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,864
I have so many debts.

204
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:29,660
My mother goes in and out of the hospital
because she has breast cancer.

205
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,293
I tried to borrow money from a friend.

206
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:39,670
Turns out, he's a member of a syndicate

207
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,255
and now he's asking for payment.

208
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,425
He says that if I don't pay him,

209
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:48,679
they will do something bad to Mama.

210
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:51,307
If what you're saying is true,

211
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:53,517
you should've gone to Sir Galvan
and asked for help

212
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,477
instead of pretending that
you were a Palacios.

213
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,898
Bro, this was the only choice I had.

214
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,070
You are sick in the head.

215
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:10,534
You think that fake can replace Basil?

216
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,703
No!

217
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:14,914
- Never!
- I know!

218
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,459
I am not trying to replace Basil.

219
00:15:18,542 --> 00:15:20,336
It just so happened
that someone came to me

220
00:15:20,419 --> 00:15:22,087
who happens to be a Palacios.

221
00:15:22,171 --> 00:15:23,631
He introduced himself.

222
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:28,135
Now, if he's really the son of Rodolfo,

223
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,387
then I will accept him as family.

224
00:15:31,221 --> 00:15:32,598
And if not,

225
00:15:33,098 --> 00:15:37,269
I will be the first one
to drag him away from here.

226
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:41,398
Or if it will make you happy,

227
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,611
I'll be the first one to kill him.

228
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,197
You're a fool.

229
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,865
Stupid!

230
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,617
Gullible!

231
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,080
Basil, my God!

232
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,086
Please haunt your father
so he comes to his senses!

233
00:16:11,887 --> 00:16:13,889
Help me, just this once.

234
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:16,058
- Bro, just for a little while.
- No, Peter.

235
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,434
You betrayed me.

236
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:21,271
Rebecca and I were being very careful,
waiting for the right moment

237
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,232
to tell them that I am a Palacios.

238
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:25,442
And then you did this, you fool,

239
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,236
You destroyed all that.

240
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:33,659
Take back what you said to Sir Galvan.

241
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,953
Take it back!

242
00:16:36,745 --> 00:16:38,664
Fine. I will.

243
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,001
I will take it back…

244
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,420
but…

245
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:47,047
let him help me first.

246
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,674
No.

247
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:50,092
Take it back this instant.

248
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:53,053
Don't ask for his help. Take it back now.

249
00:16:56,932 --> 00:16:59,018
- Yes, I'll take it back.
- Do it now.

250
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,936
Hey, Jerico!

251
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,440
You're taking up so much of Peter's time.

252
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,066
Let us talk to him.

253
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,651
- Hey, you.
- Yes?

254
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,445
You didn't tell us you were our boss.

255
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:13,782
Don't you dare ask me to call you "Sir"
or I will kick your mouth.

256
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,701
No need.

257
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,329
Boss Peter, whatever wrong
I've done before,

258
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,374
I hope you'll forget about it.

259
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,835
I hope you will not fire me.

260
00:17:24,918 --> 00:17:26,587
- It's nothing.
- There you go.

261
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,172
Thank you.

262
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,299
Sir, can you lend us some money?

263
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,759
- For the two of us.
- Both of you?

264
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,761
- You'll borrow money?
- Okay, later, let's talk.

265
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,221
Later, we're getting free lunches,
and snacks too!

266
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,141
What's with you? Stop that.

267
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,434
Sir, let us some money.

268
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,729
He's not the same person anymore.

269
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:58,952
Jerico, what are the staff busy with?

270
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,747
The new Palacios, ma'am.

271
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:21,975
Everyone, out now.

272
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,394
Someone is coming.

273
00:18:24,478 --> 00:18:26,396
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

274
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:51,505
You didn't lock the door again, Peter.

275
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:08,225
Ms. Sam?

276
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,602
What are you doing here?

277
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,108
I am investigating.

278
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,820
And I found a piece of evidence.

279
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,660
Peter, is this your bed?

280
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:28,370
Yes, ma'am.

281
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,372
What's the matter?

282
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,460
Why is there blood on your shoes?

283
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,841
Did you kill Beverly?

284
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,153
Ma'am, it wasn't me.

285
00:22:03,613 --> 00:22:05,490
Then why is there blood on your shoes?

286
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:06,908
Peter,

287
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,702
don't tell me you're the killer.

288
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:11,330
It wasn't me.

289
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,541
That's not human blood.

290
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,168
That's pig's blood.

291
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,504
You can even send that to Sergeant Villa
to have it checked.

292
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,131
Pig's blood?

293
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,467
Yes, ma'am.

294
00:22:24,134 --> 00:22:27,054
That's from the pig's head.

295
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:30,265
The one we used to scare Ma'am Beverly.

296
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,976
Wait. There was no blood
when you buried it.

297
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,771
There was blood in it when I bought it.

298
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,899
She didn't only ask me
to buy a pig's head.

299
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,695
Beverly asked you to buy it?

300
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:47,741
Peter, admit it.

301
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:49,367
You already had a slip of the tongue.

302
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,881
Yes, ma'am.

303
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,383
It was Ma'am Beverly who did it.

304
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:09,096
She was the one who orchestrated it
saying that you were behind it

305
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:12,474
to get Sir Galvan's sympathy.

306
00:23:13,391 --> 00:23:15,894
Ma'am George, I'm sorry.

307
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:17,437
Sorry?

308
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:21,316
After you connived with Beverly
to make it look like I was the bad one,

309
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,734
all you can say is sorry?

310
00:23:23,693 --> 00:23:25,487
You're so evil, Peter.

311
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:28,115
Ma'am George…

312
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:30,450
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

313
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:34,162
She made me do it.

314
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:36,998
Maybe she paid you.

315
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,252
Peter.

316
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,965
Have you known Beverly for a long time?

317
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,051
<i>Are you okay now, Beverly?</i>

318
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,761
More than okay.

319
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:57,769
I called you in your province to tell you
that Sir Basil was dead.

320
00:23:58,228 --> 00:24:01,606
Without me, you wouldn't be here now.

321
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,744
Peter, I'm asking you.

322
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,038
Ma'am…

323
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,667
I only met Ma'am Beverly recently.

324
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,713
Ma'am,

325
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,631
I'm really sorry.

326
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:29,176
All right.

327
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,428
Getting angry about it
won't do me any good.

328
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:32,971
It's not worth it.

329
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,974
Besides, you're my cousin-in-law now.

330
00:24:38,185 --> 00:24:39,561
Cousin-in-law?

331
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,480
You didn't know?

332
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,527
Peter is a Palacios.

333
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:53,867
See? You weren't even updated.

334
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:59,289
You were too busy pointing fingers.

335
00:24:59,372 --> 00:25:00,832
But it turns out, you were wrong.

336
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,842
Yes.

337
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:14,054
Tell your boss I will pay him.

338
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,306
So stop calling me already.

339
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,737
What's with you, Peter?

340
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:40,330
He stole your identity!

341
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,292
I can't forgive what Peter did.

342
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:45,877
And I definitely can't.

343
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,296
You know what?

344
00:25:48,922 --> 00:25:51,466
There's actually one good thing
about what Peter did.

345
00:25:51,549 --> 00:25:53,510
You think there's something good
about what that jerk did?

346
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,304
Well, you saw how Uncle Galvan reacted.

347
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:58,306
Right?

348
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,100
He's welcoming.

349
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,778
I want you to leave this estate at once.

350
00:26:11,861 --> 00:26:12,904
No.

351
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:14,739
Auntie.

352
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:16,908
- Auntie Aurora.
- Oh, God!

353
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,076
Don't call me that!

354
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,537
How dare you call me Auntie Aurora?!

355
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,122
Get out of here!

356
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,750
You can't kick me out of here.

357
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,421
Only Uncle Galvan can kick me out.

358
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,217
You are not a Palacios.

359
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:35,677
- Get out of here!
- Ma! Stop!

360
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,220
You're shameless.

361
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,180
- That's enough, Ma.
- Come here! Come here!

362
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,099
- Come here!
- Ma!

363
00:26:41,182 --> 00:26:42,767
- That's enough!
- Let me go!

364
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,020
- Ma! Ma, that's enough!
- What now?

365
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,187
- What now?
- Ma, that's enough!

366
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:48,982
Hey.

367
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:50,400
You know what? Let's just…

368
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,403
Let's look for Papa some other time, okay?

369
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:58,325
Let's just tell Uncle Galvan
and Auntie Aurora the truth!

370
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,619
That you are the real Palacios.

371
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,206
So that Peter will stop pretending.

372
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,751
Before I can tell them
that I am a Palacios,

373
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,002
I need to have proof.

374
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:11,421
Then let's get a DNA test.

375
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:16,801
Thank you.

376
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,973
Get out of here!

377
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:25,852
I don't want to see your face here, Peter!

378
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,396
Remember that!

379
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,231
Auntie Aurora, that's enough.

380
00:27:30,315 --> 00:27:31,566
You too!

381
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:33,860
Get out of my face, George!

382
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:37,947
Why are you so mad at me?
What did I do to you?

383
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:40,950
I am annoyed by your face!

384
00:27:41,034 --> 00:27:43,078
Is that okay?

385
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,663
Then don't look at me.

386
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,874
What did you say?

387
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,293
Are you being sarcastic with me?

388
00:27:50,377 --> 00:27:51,795
Ma, that's enough. That's enough.

389
00:27:51,878 --> 00:27:53,713
Ma, stop it.

390
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,427
Get out of here!

391
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,388
Get out!

392
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,640
Get out! Get out!

393
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,146
Let's go. Uncle Galvan is looking for you.

394
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,193
Take that with you too.

395
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,795
Sam?

396
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:36,339
Are you back from seeing the doctor?

397
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,133
How's my grandchild?

398
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,760
I haven't gone yet.

399
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:42,971
I had my appointment moved
to this afternoon.

400
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,349
Is that so? You weren't at the 9th day
novena. Where were you?

401
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,979
I went to Jerico and Peter's room.

402
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:53,356
I investigated, but…

403
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,359
I didn't find anything.

404
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,738
From now on, you should be wearing these.

405
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:02,949
Since you're now a Palacios,
we'll go shopping next week.

406
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:07,954
Ma'am, I'm good with
Sir Basil's old clothes.

407
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:10,165
They still look new.

408
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,333
- Thank you.
- There's still some more.

409
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,960
I'm going to find some more.

410
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:16,171
And please, don't call me "ma'am."

411
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,006
Okay.

412
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:20,175
From now on, I'll call you George.

413
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,719
Peter,

414
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:27,182
don't let Auntie Aurora and Sam
belittle you.

415
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,516
Or even Vivian.

416
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,601
I'll take care of you.

417
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:32,729
Okay.

418
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,315
Did you know that Peter is a Palacios?

419
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,321
But Aurora doesn't believe it yet.

420
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,116
How about you? Do you believe him?

421
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,247
I don't know.

422
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:55,919
There's something about him.

423
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:57,712
What?

424
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:00,882
Peter.

425
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:04,260
Have you known Beverly for a long time?

426
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,473
Peter, I'm asking you.

427
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:10,391
Ma'am…

428
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,978
I only met Ma'am Beverly recently.

429
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,190
Tell your boss I will pay him.

430
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,526
So stop calling me already.

431
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,614
He seems to be hiding something.

432
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,785
Peter, let's go.

433
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:32,038
Dr. Dionela's assistant is on her way

434
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:34,833
to get your sample for your DNA Test.

435
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:39,420
Come on. Follow me upstairs.

436
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:41,256
Okay.

437
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:46,427
I'll just leave this here, ma'am.

438
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,054
George.

439
00:30:48,763 --> 00:30:51,266
George. Okay.

440
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,814
Maybe he was the one who…

441
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,816
What?

442
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,821
Who killed Beverly and Basil.

443
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,826
If he is a Palacios, why would he do that?

444
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:13,329
I don't know.

445
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,882
George, what was that?

446
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:26,551
Why are you being nice to Peter?

447
00:31:26,634 --> 00:31:30,138
Didn't he connive with Beverly
against you?

448
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,181
Just relax, Mother.

449
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:34,225
That's just a strategy.

450
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,977
I'm just looking for an ally.

451
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:40,023
People like Peter are capable
of committing a crime

452
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,774
just to satisfy their ambition.

453
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:02,879
What are you looking for, Sam?

454
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,092
Mother, Paco's favorite camera is missing.

455
00:32:08,801 --> 00:32:11,012
I cannot accept

456
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:15,016
that another outsider
will come into the estate.

457
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,940
The estate is already
overflowing with gold diggers.

458
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,240
Maybe Aurora took it.

459
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,868
I saw her here earlier.

460
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,036
She came in here.

461
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:37,830
What was she doing here?

462
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:40,583
She said she missed Paco,

463
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,252
and that's why
she looked at your pictures.

464
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:52,345
You look good in this lighting.

465
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,139
Not like that Peter.

466
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:59,102
He wouldn't pass as a Palacios
just based on appearance.

467
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:02,897
But…

468
00:33:03,898 --> 00:33:05,441
he knows Jessica.

469
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,408
He knows the story of Jessica and Rodolfo.

470
00:33:16,077 --> 00:33:18,037
What if…

471
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:23,835
Peter is a real Palacios?

472
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,384
So when will the results
of that DNA Test come out?

473
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,636
By tomorrow, there'll be a result.

474
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:37,015
No, I spoke to Dr. Dionela.

475
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:38,641
I asked him to have it rushed.

476
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,268
We need the results by tonight.

477
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,271
Okay, sir. Are we all set?

478
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,690
Yes, ma'am.

479
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,233
I brought something.

480
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,694
It has my saliva.

481
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,405
<i>No.</i>

482
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:35,782
No.

483
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,409
I won't allow it.

484
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:41,913
That leech is a stranger to me.

485
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:44,332
He didn't grow up a Palacios.

486
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:51,631
…turns out to be a Palacios…

487
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:59,597
I will get rid of him just like I got rid
of his mother, Jessica.

488
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,616
No outsider

489
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:22,078
can pretend to be a Palacios,

490
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,372
right?

491
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:38,678
Peter…

492
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:41,639
Palacios?

493
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,934
I'm sorry, sir,
but we can no longer use that.

494
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,435
It might be contaminated.

495
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,814
So we'll just get new samples, okay?

496
00:35:52,525 --> 00:35:54,026
Ma'am, I don't want to.

497
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,446
Peter, why are you refusing?

498
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,658
Are you hiding something, Peter?

499
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,495
Ma'am, no.

500
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,539
Well, there you go.

501
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,958
Then, why don't you want them
to get your blood sample?

502
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:14,839
Ma'am, I'm scared of needles.

503
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:19,760
We can also use your saliva for the test.

504
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,654
One of Basil's staff, Peter,
is his cousin?

505
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,449
They'll have his DNA tested,

506
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,035
but according to Papa,
his story checks out.

507
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:49,665
So there's a new Palacios
after what happened to Beverly's child.

508
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,627
You know, I pity Beverly.

509
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,254
She may be Basil's other woman,

510
00:36:55,338 --> 00:36:56,797
but she was still a person

511
00:36:56,881 --> 00:36:57,882
and a mother.

512
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,055
Do you know that before she died,
I even offered her money?

513
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,098
For what?

514
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,560
For her unborn child.

515
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,065
You gave Beverly money?

516
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,486
What did you want me to give her?

517
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:20,279
My name?

518
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:24,700
Inigo, I'm a married man.

519
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,921
Will you tell George that
you got another woman pregnant?

520
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:41,676
I don't need to tell George anything.

521
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,096
But she's your wife.

522
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,473
And so?

523
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,769
She's just a future mother of my child,

524
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:52,937
just like Beverly.

525
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:56,941
If anything, Beverly should thank me.

526
00:37:57,483 --> 00:38:00,069
I gave her such a huge amount of money.

527
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:04,532
So you're going to get your child
after she gives birth?

528
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,746
Beverly is just a peasant. All right?

529
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,540
And that kid…

530
00:38:12,873 --> 00:38:14,792
That kid you're talking about?

531
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,460
That's a Palacios.

532
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,336
My heir.

533
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:21,257
I'm the only one who has rights
over my child.

534
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,345
This will be such a big mess.

535
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,434
Well…

536
00:38:32,727 --> 00:38:34,812
I know Beverly won't say anything

537
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:37,773
because I just made her a rich woman.

538
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:40,985
So…

539
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,030
how will George find out?

540
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,077
Who will tell her?

541
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:52,788
How will my wife know?

542
00:38:56,083 --> 00:38:57,585
Unless…

543
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,299
Unless you will tell her.

544
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,512
Inigo…

545
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,810
are you planning to betray me?

546
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,105
I will never betray you.

547
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,024
Never.

548
00:39:25,988 --> 00:39:27,406
You're so silly.

549
00:39:27,490 --> 00:39:29,283
I know that.

550
00:39:32,995 --> 00:39:35,164
I know you won't tell on me.

551
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,042
And that's why

552
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,961
you're my best friend.

553
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,845
My bestest friend in the whole world.

554
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,263
Cheers.

555
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,275
I really wanted that baby

556
00:40:04,318 --> 00:40:06,612
because he was the son of my husband.

557
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,620
God, I miss my husband.

558
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:22,670
I miss him too.

559
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,765
I miss my friend.

560
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:43,983
My best friend in the whole world.

561
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,296
What will I do?

562
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,798
What do I do now?

563
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,803
I will be exposed.

564
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,650
Calm down.

565
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:27,651
Just calm down.

566
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,282
Think.

567
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:36,911
I knew you were going to come here.

568
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:41,165
You'll be late for your appointment
with your obstetrician. Let's go.

569
00:41:42,541 --> 00:41:46,212
Mother, I won't be at peace until
my questions about Peter are answered.

570
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:49,715
I know how important it is
for you to investigate.

571
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,175
I feel the same way too.

572
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,597
But it's more important
that your baby is healthy,

573
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,015
so let's go.

574
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:06,857
Come on.

575
00:42:12,655 --> 00:42:15,032
What now?

576
00:42:15,115 --> 00:42:16,659
What am I going to do?

577
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,607
Pa, please keep Basil's collection
of watches in your safety deposit box.

578
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,734
Some people come and go
in and out of the estate.

579
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:54,446
I mean, someone might sneak in.
I just want to be safe.

580
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:57,908
Okay. I'll bring them
when I go to the bank.

581
00:42:59,868 --> 00:43:01,036
Thank you.

582
00:44:16,362 --> 00:44:17,488
Peter?

583
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,327
Are you stealing Basil's watches?

584
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:28,123
But why? Why do you have to steal?

585
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,334
No, ma'am.

586
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:32,878
- Give me that.
- I'm sorry.

587
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,338
- I said give me that!
- This is mine, ma'am!

588
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,131
- Pa! Pa!
- Ma'am, don't.

589
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,383
- Pa!
- Don't!

590
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:40,344
- Ouch!
- Pa!

591
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:41,470
Pa!

592
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:42,721
Shut up!

593
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,931
Be quiet, ma'am.

594
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,225
Just let me take them, ma'am.
I just really need…

595
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,352
- Pa!
- Be quiet!

596
00:44:48,852 --> 00:44:50,521
Please, ma'am.

597
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:53,107
- Pa!
- Stop shouting, ma'am!

598
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,363
NEXT EPISODE

599
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:02,533
Help me find him.

600
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:03,700
What happened to Peter?

601
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,285
Why did he steal? He's a Palacios.

602
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:08,038
- That jerk is not a Palacios.
- What do you mean?

603
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:11,125
Start bonding with your dad.

604
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:14,461
Especially now that there's another
outsider here in the mansion.

605
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,755
Mommy, watch your mouth!

606
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:22,469
All these talks about Palacios Mining
losing its heirs are nonsense.

607
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:27,141
That's the reason why Peter's arrival
is perfect timing.

608
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:33,480
We can recover in the stock market once
we introduce him as the new Palacios.

609
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,025
Galvan, George caught Peter stealing!

610
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:38,193
A thief?

611
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:41,613
Oh my God! I'm shocked!
