1
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,150
You need to come with us.

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:07,984
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,112
<i>We're inviting you, Mr. Castillo,</i>
<i>for custodial investigation.</i>

4
00:01:11,196 --> 00:01:12,739
Hold on! Please believe me!

5
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:14,157
I had nothing to do with it, sir!

6
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,120
- Animal! You poisoned my son! Animal!
- Sir, it wasn't me!

7
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,707
Stop it! I said stop it!

8
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:24,542
Vivian, I'm a difficult enemy to face.

9
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:26,252
Don't you dare touch this room!

10
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:28,087
Why? What will you do to me?

11
00:01:28,171 --> 00:01:31,299
Are you going to kill me
like you killed your husband?!

12
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:33,843
<i>This is not what I understood from</i>
<i>what was whispered to me.</i>

13
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:34,928
There's something wrong.

14
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:36,012
Something is wrong.

15
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:37,597
There's something wrong.

16
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,600
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

17
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:41,643
Don't!

18
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,436
I'm begging you, don't!

19
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:44,562
Galvan!

20
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,856
<i>It's all my fault.</i>

21
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,275
<i>Francis just got dragged into it.</i>

22
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,904
I stole Francis' morphine.

23
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,324
I'm the one who placed it
in George's drawer.

24
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:58,868
That means the Castillos set you up!

25
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:00,328
That family is really shameless!

26
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:03,998
They want to destroy our family.
They are animals!

27
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:07,710
Why did Basil want George killed?

28
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,004
Why did you agree to do what Basil wanted?

29
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:13,091
Because he was able to record a video
of what happened on the cliff.

30
00:02:13,174 --> 00:02:17,095
Mother, I accidentally
pushed Paco off the cliff.

31
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:18,847
What?

32
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,766
You put your brother in danger?

33
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:24,477
You're the reason he's in jail!

34
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,857
Mother, forgive me. Forgive me, please.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:33,236
I will forgive you when you get
your brother out of jail.

36
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,404
<i>What happened?</i>

37
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:37,282
Ma'am, I'm sorry, but it seems
the car broke down.

38
00:02:37,365 --> 00:02:39,242
So how are we going to bring
the casket inside?

39
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,660
<i>We will carry it.</i>

40
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,703
Let me.

41
00:02:41,786 --> 00:02:42,829
Inigo?

42
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,207
<i>Sam, it's difficult here.</i>

43
00:02:46,291 --> 00:02:48,126
I'm scared of the inmates I'm with, Sam.

44
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,794
I can't sleep.

45
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,713
Who poisoned Basil?

46
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,590
Why am I being accused?

47
00:02:55,216 --> 00:02:56,759
Why have I been dragged into this?

48
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,636
<i>Excuse me. George?</i>

49
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,054
<i>I need you to meet someone.</i>

50
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,683
This is Attorney Inigo Morales.

51
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:05,685
He's Basil's best friend.

52
00:03:05,768 --> 00:03:08,730
I will do everything I can
to get you out of here.

53
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,690
I promise you that.

54
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,150
Nice to meet you, Attorney.

55
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,986
Why did Basil never tell me about you?

56
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,915
You know, Basil's just such
a secretive person.

57
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,709
He kept a lot of things from us.

58
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,471
Did you see that?

59
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:42,555
Who?

60
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:44,724
That guy. Sir Basil's visitor.

61
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:45,892
I wonder who it is.

62
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:48,811
I wonder what his connection is to them.

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,272
This is the first time I've seen him.

64
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,943
Let's go over there.

65
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:02,909
Thank you for coming.

66
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,543
Let's go.

67
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,344
- Sit here.
- Thank you.

68
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,854
No wonder Grandpa
chose Aunt Aurora and not you

69
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:13,938
to lead the company,

70
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,898
because you don't have the balls to do it!

71
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,413
You jerk! This. Try to avoid this.

72
00:05:31,456 --> 00:05:32,832
What?

73
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,484
Who else will replace him?

74
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:04,113
I have better options in mind
rather than you!

75
00:07:18,729 --> 00:07:21,441
Darling, this is an exclusive party.

76
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,942
Leeches are not allowed.

77
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,319
I'm gonna be here the whole night!

78
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:31,260
George,

79
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:32,762
you take care, okay?

80
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,326
Galvan, I'll go ahead.

81
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:57,119
Yeah.

82
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,096
George,

83
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:16,847
let's go.

84
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,812
You can go ahead, Pa.

85
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,440
I want to spend more time with my husband.

86
00:09:40,454 --> 00:09:42,999
George, we'll wait for you, huh?

87
00:10:53,152 --> 00:10:55,988
I will not let that woman hurt you again.

88
00:10:56,614 --> 00:11:00,326
You went through so much
because of that Sam Castillo.

89
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,203
I will not respect her.

90
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:09,043
Francis will pay
for what he did to you, love.

91
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:14,256
Not only Francis,

92
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:18,386
but his whole family.

93
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,305
Galvan…

94
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:07,768
I was planning to open this

95
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:12,356
at our family luncheon tomorrow, but…

96
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,525
now seems more appropriate.

97
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:19,113
Grieving and drinking don't mix well.

98
00:12:20,865 --> 00:12:23,742
Nor do parents with dead children.

99
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,088
To our failure.

100
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,133
As parents,

101
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,635
we did our best to

102
00:12:41,719 --> 00:12:43,345
protect our children.

103
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,973
To keep them away from the grave.

104
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:49,560
But yet, even the best parents

105
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,771
cannot stop the death of their child.

106
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,357
You mean murder.

107
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,220
For what it's worth,

108
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,639
Galvan,

109
00:13:27,473 --> 00:13:29,600
you still have Sofia.

110
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,937
As for me…

111
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,816
I'm looking forward to…

112
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,820
Sam and Paco's child.

113
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:50,538
It's unfair.

114
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,627
It's unfair!

115
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:02,049
Basil didn't even leave me
with a grandchild.

116
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:06,428
It's unfair.

117
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,882
There it is, the heavy rain
is about to fall! Hurry!

118
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:35,225
Jerico!

119
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,852
You dropped your wallet! Hey!

120
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:39,980
This is thick.

121
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,135
Jerico?

122
00:16:12,012 --> 00:16:13,514
You're a Palacios?

123
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:17,935
Why are you just a helper here?

124
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,526
Dude, let's talk.

125
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,521
What the hell are you doing here?

126
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,405
George, I need your help.

127
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:17,369
Talk to Sergeant Casas.

128
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,871
Tell them to investigate more.

129
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:23,125
They need to look for more evidence.
It wasn't Francis who killed Basil.

130
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,211
Excuse me?

131
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:32,509
Do you want me to help the man
who poisoned my husband?

132
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,678
Francis is innocent.

133
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:37,139
Please believe me, George. Please.

134
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:39,183
It's possible that Francis is innocent

135
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:42,728
because it was you who poisoned Basil.

136
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,483
You used your brother's morphine

137
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:51,278
and left some in my drawer to frame me up.

138
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,407
Why would I kill Basil?

139
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:57,910
Because you were envious of me

140
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,871
because I had a husband

141
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,915
and you no longer did!

142
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,377
You poisoned Basil
so that we'd be the same.

143
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,297
George…

144
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:15,010
I would never do that to you.

145
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:18,388
You're a liar.

146
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:24,394
You poisoned Basil
and you tried to frame me up.

147
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,399
And now you're pretending that
you want to be friends with me.

148
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,821
But I know it's all part of your plan…

149
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,783
so that you can force me into a corner.

150
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:40,869
You demon!

151
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,499
You're a demon.

152
00:18:45,582 --> 00:18:46,875
- Get out of here.
- George!

153
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,085
George!

154
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:51,463
- Let go of me, George!
- Come here!

155
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,341
- You're hurting me!
- Let's fight here!

156
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,135
Let go of me!

157
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:57,511
Let go of me!

158
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:58,762
Let go of me!

159
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:03,976
Why are you so eager to blame me
for your husband's death?

160
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:06,311
Could it be because it was you
who killed Basil?

161
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:07,521
Excuse me.

162
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,730
Is that your bag?

163
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,940
Yes.

164
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,317
Excuse us.

165
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,282
Why would I poison my own husband?

166
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,743
Remember? You were wondering
if Basil had a mistress.

167
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,162
Maybe that's the reason you killed him.

168
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,497
Are you having an affair with my husband?

169
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,293
What?

170
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:32,171
Are you flirting with Basil?

171
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:35,757
Or maybe you thought he would
find out your secret.

172
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,301
That you couldn't give him a baby.

173
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:38,886
That's why you poisoned him!

174
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,096
I'm so sorry, love.

175
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,642
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to give you a baby.

176
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,021
But you still promised me
the rest of your life.

177
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:53,442
How I wish you'd fulfilled
even just half of it.

178
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,197
You bitch!

179
00:19:58,655 --> 00:19:59,781
You're a beast!

180
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:01,742
Bitch!

181
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,035
Animal!

182
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,494
Take back what you said!

183
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:05,996
You're shameless!

184
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,873
Let me go!

185
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,666
You're so shameless!

186
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,129
I didn't kill your husband
and my brother didn't either!

187
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,006
- You're so shameless!
- Stop it!

188
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:18,592
You bitch!

189
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,758
Oh, I'm sorry.

190
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,344
Did I disturb your catfight?

191
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:06,223
And who the hell are you?

192
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,725
I'm Bev.

193
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:10,310
Beverly Maison.

194
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:16,441
Hello, babe?

195
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,152
Babe, I have good news.

196
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:24,199
Girlfriend of Basil.

197
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:41,508
Girlfriend of Basil?

198
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,971
That's what he calls me.

199
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,514
His girlfriend.

200
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,143
You're mistaken.

201
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,103
Basil doesn't have a girlfriend.

202
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:57,149
He was happily married to me and only me.

203
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,817
I think you are lost.

204
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,738
This is the Palacios mausoleum, right?

205
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:06,616
I have been here before.

206
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,162
Do you know her?

207
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,083
Look, miss.

208
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:17,794
I don't know who you are
or what you're up to,

209
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,629
but please can you leave us?

210
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,466
Can't you see we're fighting here?

211
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,470
I have no plans
of getting involved with you.

212
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,472
If you want, you can continue fighting.

213
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:38,940
I'm just here to grieve
the death of my baby's father.

214
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,034
You're pregnant with Basil's baby?

215
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:51,203
Who else?

216
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,663
It's too bad

217
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:56,041
he won't be able to see our baby.

218
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,627
He was even excited to hold the baby.

219
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,266
You're a liar.

220
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,393
I don't believe a word you say.

221
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,980
How would I benefit from lying?

222
00:23:19,397 --> 00:23:20,732
Money, of course!

223
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,234
What else but money?

224
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:24,236
You only want to extort money from us!

225
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,321
That's not the reason why I came here.

226
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,116
Look.

227
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,618
This isn't an original story.

228
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,455
An unknown pregnant girl suddenly shows up

229
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:38,416
claiming she got pregnant by a rich guy.

230
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:40,877
Well, guess what?

231
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,754
Basil is already gone.

232
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,132
No one can verify your claim.

233
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,095
George,

234
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:53,682
didn't you suspect that
Basil had a mistress?

235
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,935
Could she be the one?

236
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,231
Did Basil mention me before?

237
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:05,026
He told me to keep it as a secret
until I gave birth.

238
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,406
Don't give yourself too much credit.

239
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,700
You're just a lying gold digger

240
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,702
who wants a piece of his money.

241
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,579
Leave.

242
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:20,292
I said leave!

243
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,670
Leave!

244
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:24,838
Leave!

245
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,131
Go take your umbrella!

246
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:41,563
You too, Sam! Leave!

247
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,243
Did Basil get someone else pregnant?

248
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,745
That's what Beverly said.

249
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,873
But, Mother, remember?

250
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,334
George was having doubts before, right?

251
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:45,961
She suspected that her husband
had a mistress.

252
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,047
She even suspected that
I was the mistress.

253
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,678
Do you think it has anything to do
with Basil's death?

254
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:59,891
It means George had a strong motive
to kill her husband.

255
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:03,603
She could have killed Basil because
her husband was cheating on her.

256
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,403
Will Francis

257
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,864
be released tomorrow?

258
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,037
I don't know.

259
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,539
Maybe not yet.

260
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,625
Francis is still under
custodial investigation.

261
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:28,420
While the case is being investigated,
he'll be in the detention center.

262
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,213
They need to drop the case first.

263
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,341
Mother…

264
00:26:45,895 --> 00:26:49,983
For now, I won't be happy yet.

265
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,194
While he is still in jail

266
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:55,780
because of what you did,

267
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,074
I will not celebrate.

268
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:04,956
Go ahead.

269
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:08,126
Go to sleep.

270
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,005
Staying up late is bad for pregnant women.

271
00:27:12,088 --> 00:27:14,090
I will keep tidying Francis' things.

272
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:21,973
Go.

273
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,002
You would never betray me.

274
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,464
Right, love?

275
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,220
She is lying.

276
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:27,080
I don't want to.

277
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:28,998
You go.

278
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,754
George…

279
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:38,508
eat first.

280
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:50,019
If you need anything, just let me know.

281
00:29:11,958 --> 00:29:14,252
When will George be okay?

282
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,756
Don't rush it.

283
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,841
It's a long process.

284
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:23,428
But I know

285
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:26,055
that she can overcome this,
just like I did.

286
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,597
Okay.

287
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:09,599
You can… go now.

288
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,975
Is everything ready for lunch?

289
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,268
How about the dessert, is it okay?

290
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,312
Yeah, my sous chef is on top of it.

291
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:16,981
You know Basil. He wouldn't have
wanted any problems

292
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,608
on this kind of occasion.

293
00:30:18,691 --> 00:30:19,776
Yup.

294
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,070
No wonder why my cousin loved you.

295
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,281
You know what? You are so, so caring.

296
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:27,659
Anyway…

297
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,869
You can go over there. Go ahead.
Auntie is there already.

298
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:31,996
- Okay, thank you.
- All right.

299
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:42,090
You again.

300
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,552
How did you get in here?

301
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,178
George, I'm not here to make a scene.

302
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,805
I just want to talk to Sir Galvan.

303
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,640
You will do no such thing.

304
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:52,183
Guard!

305
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:53,935
Guard!

306
00:30:55,478 --> 00:30:56,813
Guard!

307
00:30:57,939 --> 00:30:58,898
Guard!

308
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:01,860
George, what's happening?

309
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,363
We have an unwanted guest, Mother.

310
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:11,911
Beverly?

311
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:14,330
You know her?

312
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:15,748
But of course.

313
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:19,711
She's our media relations officer
who resigned months ago.

314
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:22,130
Now, we all know why you left.

315
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,631
Who's the father, Beverly?

316
00:31:27,010 --> 00:31:30,096
Do we know the father
of the baby you are carrying?

317
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:32,098
Is it someone from the company?

318
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,112
It's Basil.

319
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:15,516
Sam, how did you know this?

320
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,978
She told us last night, George.

321
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,271
Right, George?

322
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:25,234
She was claiming
that she was Basil's girlfriend.

323
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,406
Basil had a mistress?

324
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,577
Beverly,

325
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,037
is this true?

326
00:32:36,996 --> 00:32:39,374
Did you have an affair with my son?

327
00:32:44,545 --> 00:32:47,674
Go ahead, tell them
what you told us last night.

328
00:32:47,757 --> 00:32:49,050
- Sam, please.
- It's okay.

329
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,510
Don't meddle.

330
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,221
Beverly, speak up.

331
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:57,141
I didn't intend to reveal
the truth this way,

332
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,061
but it's true.

333
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,940
Basil and I had an affair.

334
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:14,826
Hey.

335
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:18,246
Did you know there was a scene earlier?

336
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:22,000
Sir Basil had a mistress!

337
00:33:23,876 --> 00:33:25,920
He wasn't content
with Ma'am George's beauty.

338
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,422
Yeah, I don't know about him.

339
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,132
And not only that,

340
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:32,176
but the mistress is pregnant.

341
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,511
Come on.

342
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:37,265
Sir Galvan has an illegitimate child,
right? Ma'am Sofia.

343
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:38,057
You have a point.

344
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,810
So I'm not surprised
that Sir Basil did the same thing.

345
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:48,276
Because it's in the Palacios blood

346
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,819
to have illegitimate children.

347
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:04,000
So the baby you are carrying

348
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,710
is Basil's?

349
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,879
You're so shameless.

350
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:09,714
You had an affair with a married man!

351
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,802
George, I'm sorry.

352
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,096
I knew you were married already.

353
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,807
So you knew.

354
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,727
Why did you choose a married man?

355
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,606
I was lonely at the time.

356
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:28,816
My ex and I had separated.

357
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,652
He was there. He was comforting me.

358
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,571
I didn't plan to become a mistress.

359
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:36,991
It just happened.

360
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,994
But you couldn't keep your legs together.

361
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:42,622
How predictable!

362
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,207
Office affair.

363
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:50,588
After what happened between us,
I resigned from the company.

364
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:53,841
I was ashamed of what I'd done.

365
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:57,428
And then I found out
we were having a baby.

366
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,181
I knew it.

367
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:03,518
It's impossible that Basil
would have been loyal.

368
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,269
He was so good-looking.

369
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,188
Of course he'd have had an affair
with someone else.

370
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,774
You're really going to take the side
of this woman, huh?

371
00:35:09,857 --> 00:35:11,943
Well, it's because you're the same!
You're both mistresses!

372
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,028
What did you say?

373
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:15,863
If you don't stop,
I will sew your mouth shut!

374
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,115
- Really?
- Yes!

375
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,242
I will sew your mouth shut!

376
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,244
- Yeah, for real!
- Wait, wait, wait.

377
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:23,329
- You're shameless!
- You're more shameless!

378
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:24,580
- What, you're clean, is that it?
- Hey!

379
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:25,873
- You're both mistresses.
- Hey!

380
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,083
You're not clean yourself!

381
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:29,794
Dad was already a widower
before they got together.

382
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:31,420
- Hey!
- Don't raise your voice at my mother.

383
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:33,047
- Your mom is rude!
- Hey!

384
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,049
- She's so cheap!
- Hey! Listen to yourselves!

385
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:37,593
- Quiet, everyone! Quiet!
- Hey! Watch it!

386
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,387
- You better teach your kid properly!
- Please!

387
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,980
George. Beverly.

388
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,440
Follow me.

389
00:36:40,573 --> 00:36:42,575
I am going to have a grandchild?

390
00:36:44,035 --> 00:36:46,704
Feel the child so you can believe it.

391
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,792
Pa!

392
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:55,880
Do you honestly believe
that baby is Basil's?

393
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,299
We all heard her confession.

394
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,676
The night something happened
between her and Basil,

395
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,346
she'd just broken up with her boyfriend.

396
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:05,014
So?

397
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:09,852
"So"? It means that the baby could be
your ex-boyfriend's and not Basil's.

398
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,231
My ex and I used protection.

399
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:15,233
But you and Basil didn't?

400
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:17,818
What happened between us was unplanned.

401
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,906
Just say you only want the baby
to be a Palacios.

402
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,243
You're really involving your baby
in your scam?

403
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:31,165
You're just bitter because Basil and I
will have a baby, and you won't.

404
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:32,375
Enough!

405
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,710
George has a point.

406
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,592
We need to verify
if the baby you are carrying is Basil's.

407
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:46,264
You have to undergo
a prenatal paternity test.

408
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,855
Do you think I'm lying?

409
00:37:55,606 --> 00:37:57,775
What would I get from lying?

410
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:00,987
See, Pa?

411
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,323
I told you she's a fraud.

412
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:06,075
I know girls like that.

413
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,873
When do we do the paternity test?

414
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:25,845
This is called a non-invasive
prenatal paternity test.

415
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:30,933
We will compare the DNA and blood
of Sir Galvan

416
00:38:31,017 --> 00:38:35,187
and the DNA of your baby that will come
from your bloodstream, Ma'am Beverly.

417
00:38:35,688 --> 00:38:39,191
We have a 99.9% accuracy rate.

418
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,652
When do we get the results?

419
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,113
Normally, after seven days, sir,

420
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,741
but we can expedite as per your request.

421
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:53,331
All right, thank you.

422
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,802
Well, Pa, in less than a week,

423
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,222
we'll be able to confirm that
this woman is just fooling us.

424
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,060
That everything she said is a lie.

425
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:19,940
Amando,

426
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:24,570
light some incense on the altar.

427
00:39:24,653 --> 00:39:29,408
This house needs divine protection

428
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:33,621
from mistresses and illegitimate children.

429
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:45,549
Ma, do you believe what Beverly said?

430
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,429
I don't know her, but I know Basil.

431
00:39:51,013 --> 00:39:55,142
He's the type of man
who would betray his family.

432
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:56,268
Poor George.

433
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:01,565
Maybe I'm telling the truth.

434
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:04,944
The question is, can you handle the truth?

435
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:10,032
That Basil and I have a baby,
and, obviously, you don't.

436
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,660
What did you say?

437
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,247
Don't.

438
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,898
Could it be

439
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:47,778
that George has known for a long time
that Basil had a mistress,

440
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:49,488
and that's the reason why…

441
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,950
why she killed her husband?

442
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:56,454
Is that the reason

443
00:40:56,871 --> 00:41:00,374
why you exposed Beverly's secret?

444
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:07,131
To make us think that George
is a bitter, vengeful wife

445
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,800
who killed her own husband.

446
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,305
Ma, Francis is innocent.

447
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:17,433
He had no reason to kill Basil.

448
00:41:17,516 --> 00:41:19,643
The evidence is pointing at Francis.

449
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:20,895
Because he has been set up.

450
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,938
Why? Do you have proof?

451
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,490
Ma, I'm begging you.

452
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,158
Help Francis.

453
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:36,911
Help my brother, please.

454
00:41:38,662 --> 00:41:43,125
If your brother is really innocent
like you're telling me he is…

455
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,671
he'll be acquitted, Sam.

456
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,429
Let the authorities handle this.

457
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:57,556
Okay?

458
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,477
Francis.

459
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,479
Son, how are you?

460
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,027
- What's that?
- What's this?

461
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,821
Come on, sit down. What happened?

462
00:42:54,530 --> 00:42:56,407
Ugh! It's so itchy.

463
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:57,366
Don't scratch it.

464
00:42:57,449 --> 00:42:58,784
- It's itchy, Mom.
- Can I see it?

465
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,537
I think I got infected by
my fellow inmates.

466
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:06,375
- What is that?
- It's so itchy.

467
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:08,544
There's a lot here.

468
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,588
- Mother…
- Yes?

469
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:11,755
Mother, I don't want to stay here.

470
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,632
How much longer must I stay here?

471
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:18,262
I've already talked to three lawyers,

472
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:20,889
but they haven't gotten back to me yet.

473
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,184
At this rate, I'm going to die
because of this place, not cancer.

474
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,812
Francis…

475
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:31,025
Remember, I promised you
that I would help you.

476
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,569
I will get you out of here.

477
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,072
You should.

478
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:42,328
You should do everything you can for your
brother so that he can be released.

479
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:44,455
Mother.

480
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:47,082
Mother, don't get mad at Sam.

481
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:49,376
Let's trust her.

482
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,211
She says she'll get me out of here,

483
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:52,755
so she'll do it.

484
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:55,716
You will not forsake me, right, Sam?

485
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:14,610
Get out of this property. Get out!

486
00:44:14,693 --> 00:44:15,944
It's you who should leave.

487
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,196
Why would I leave?

488
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,281
I am the wife. I am the legal wife!

489
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,701
The only reason Basil married you
is because he felt sorry for you.

490
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,703
You're really asking for it, huh?

491
00:44:24,787 --> 00:44:28,082
<i>I recommend that she go on bed rest</i>
<i>for a couple of days.</i>

492
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,249
<i>And most of all,</i>

493
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,126
she should avoid stress.

494
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:34,046
From now on, Sam,
you shouldn't leave the house.

495
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,756
<i>You will help Francis?</i>

496
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:38,175
Your brother will get mad
if you'll meddle.

497
00:44:38,258 --> 00:44:42,930
He's too busy handling the drama between
George and Basil's mistress.

498
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,848
George, since when did you become violent?

499
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:46,975
I've known you for years,
but you never used to be like this.

500
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,896
Don't say that I'm your friend
because I will really hurt you.

501
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:51,855
Be careful.

502
00:44:51,939 --> 00:44:54,441
They might think that was your motive
for killing your husband.

503
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,984
I hate you!

504
00:44:56,068 --> 00:44:57,027
NEXT EPISODE

505
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:00,322
That's roughly around
ten million pesos' worth of jewelry.

506
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,407
You can have all of it.

507
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:04,076
I just want one thing in return.

508
00:45:04,159 --> 00:45:06,620
After you give birth,
you will give the baby to me.

509
00:45:06,703 --> 00:45:10,749
I will raise the child and I will treat
the baby like my own.
