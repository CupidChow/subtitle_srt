1
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:09,819
- Pa, I want that woman out of this house!
- I'll call you back.

2
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,071
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:13,990
We have a condo in Makati.
She can stay there.

4
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,992
She doesn't have to live here.

5
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,244
I want to monitor her 24/7.

6
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:22,957
And now you even want me to live under
the same roof with that whore?

7
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,251
Watch your mouth, woman!

8
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:27,545
<i>I want it simple.</i>

9
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:30,131
I don't want too much attention.

10
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:34,093
The people here see me
as Basil's mistress.

11
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,221
Don't you ever call yourself that.

12
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:39,098
With Basil's baby inside of you,

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:41,601
you can now wish for bigger things.

14
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,479
You just don't know how much
you've made me happy.

15
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,983
That's roughly around
ten million pesos' worth of jewelry.

16
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,401
You can have all of it.

17
00:01:50,485 --> 00:01:52,946
After you give birth,
you will give the baby to me.

18
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:57,075
I will raise the baby and I will treat
your baby like my own child.

19
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,410
My baby is not for sale.

20
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:02,080
<i>After I give birth,</i>

21
00:02:02,163 --> 00:02:05,083
<i>I can even get more than</i>
<i>what you can offer.</i>

22
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:10,505
You remind me so much of Paco.
You're so stubborn.

23
00:02:10,588 --> 00:02:13,758
Your doctor just told you that
you need rest, Sam.

24
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,469
I'm just looking for a lawyer for Francis.

25
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:18,638
I've printed out a list of prospects.

26
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,099
I already found one for you.

27
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:25,228
Sam, this is Attorney Joseph Kintanar.

28
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:27,814
Sam, a pleasure to meet you.

29
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,815
Nice to meet you.

30
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:31,109
You say your brother is innocent.

31
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:37,407
Who then do you think
poisoned Basil Palacios?

32
00:02:37,782 --> 00:02:40,660
Sergeant Casas, I wasn't expecting you.

33
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,204
Are you Ms. Beverly Maison?

34
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,582
Yes, that's me.

35
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,876
Can we invite you to the police station?

36
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,047
Beverly Maison was at home at the time
Basil Palacios got murdered.

37
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,801
But my gut tells me it's George.

38
00:02:56,885 --> 00:03:00,471
Infidelity has always been
the leading motive.

39
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:04,684
Uncover the secrets of George
and the people around her.

40
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,228
But I had nothing to do
with Basil's murder.

41
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:09,147
This is just routine questioning.

42
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,941
<i>We just want to ask her</i>
<i>about her statement</i>

43
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,818
<i>just in case we forgot something.</i>

44
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:15,069
<i>Don't say a word.</i>

45
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,487
<i>I will call my lawyer, okay?</i>

46
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,451
Me?

47
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,369
Yes.

48
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,288
I will be the one to investigate?

49
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,751
Why me? Why not the police or you?

50
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,002
Sam,

51
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:34,589
people are cautious with persons
in authority.

52
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:36,299
But what do I know? I'm just…

53
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,801
- I'm just an interior designer.
- Exactly.

54
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:42,055
No one will suspect that
you have a hidden agenda.

55
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,682
People will open up to you.

56
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,894
All you have to do is to earn their trust.

57
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,230
And how do I do that?

58
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,815
We're not accusing you of anything.

59
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,400
We just want to know where you were

60
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:58,154
at the time of Mr. Basil Palacios' party.

61
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:00,740
Let's just wait for my lawyer.

62
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,119
Hi.

63
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,163
I'm sorry, I'm late.

64
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,249
I am Attorney Cecil Velaria.

65
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:12,001
I'll be representing Beverly Maison.

66
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,394
By creating conflict.

67
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:34,107
People will look for allies
if they have enemies.

68
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:37,735
And you will be that ally.

69
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,155
That is how you earn their trust.

70
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,326
That is how you learn their secrets.

71
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:59,215
A lot of people were invited
to Basil's birthday party.

72
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,426
I was invited too.

73
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,722
But why on earth would Basil
invite his own mistress

74
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:07,015
to his birthday party

75
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,558
when I was there?

76
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,812
What, was he planning to announce that
he and Beverly were having a baby?

77
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,648
Basil always has a plan,

78
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:19,110
but definitely not this one.

79
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:23,156
He's not the type.

80
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,245
And…

81
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:35,501
he would never do this to his family.

82
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,332
Do you think…

83
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:20,129
Basil loved Beverly more than me?

84
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,381
Hey.

85
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:25,301
You're overthinking this.

86
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:13,224
What's happening?

87
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,654
Beverly!

88
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:29,198
What--

89
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:33,369
Who did this?

90
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:34,996
Beverly!

91
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:41,711
You did this!

92
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,047
You!

93
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,632
You did this to me!

94
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:49,051
George!

95
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,678
Did you do this?

96
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:54,182
Pa, I had nothing to do with it!

97
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,226
Who else is mad at me?

98
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,646
Ever since I arrived in this house,
you have been undermining me!

99
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,023
Why?

100
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,276
So I'll be scared? So I'll leave?

101
00:08:05,359 --> 00:08:07,987
So I will have a miscarriage
and lose my baby?

102
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:12,158
And you hated the idea
of Beverly living here.

103
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:15,786
But that doesn't mean I did this.

104
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,622
I hate to break it to you,

105
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,291
but I'm not going anywhere!

106
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,251
And maybe you should!

107
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:23,753
What?

108
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:26,797
Uncle…

109
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,509
Papa!

110
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,636
I want her out of this house!

111
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:47,860
Uncle,

112
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:50,154
throw George out of here.

113
00:08:50,905 --> 00:08:53,866
As long as she's here,
my child and I are in danger!

114
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,328
Look at what she did to my room!

115
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,622
I had nothing to do with this!

116
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,668
What's next?

117
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,380
You'll push me to kill me and my baby?

118
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,383
You're going crazy, Beverly!

119
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,470
You are the crazier one.

120
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,515
- So get out of here!
- Let go of me.

121
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,059
You have no right to throw me out of here.

122
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,603
This is my house and I am Basil's wife.

123
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,106
But I am carrying his child.

124
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:29,110
A pregnant mother is more valuable
than a dry widow!

125
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,027
Enough!

126
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:32,863
This is so petty!

127
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,866
Pa, believe me.

128
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,368
I didn't do this.

129
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:40,288
Uncle Galvan, Beverly,

130
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:41,706
I can attest to that.

131
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,500
George and I have been together
for quite some time.

132
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:47,086
It's impossible that
she had anything to do with that.

133
00:09:49,964 --> 00:09:51,132
No…

134
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,818
Both of you,

135
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,570
call everyone now!

136
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:13,654
- Yes, sir.
- Now!

137
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,126
George, what's happening?

138
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:34,175
Which of you put a pig's head
in Beverly's room?

139
00:10:35,384 --> 00:10:36,969
Most likely George!

140
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,347
I already said it wasn't me.

141
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,934
Beverly could have had a miscarriage
because of that incident!

142
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,063
I could have lost my grandchild!

143
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,856
It wasn't me, sir.

144
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,734
Ward? Sofia?

145
00:10:52,443 --> 00:10:53,903
It wasn't me.

146
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,406
It wasn't me either.
I was just watching TV.

147
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,244
None of you are going to come forward?

148
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:06,207
Sir, maybe the reason for that is that
none of us would ever do that.

149
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,835
You lot are the only people
who have access to Beverly's room.

150
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,798
Don't tell me it was the people
from Aurora's house?

151
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:28,604
One of you tried to scare Beverly.

152
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,982
Confess now!

153
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:37,029
No one will talk, huh?

154
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,657
Peter, get my gun.

155
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,575
Uncle,

156
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:45,079
let's not blow this out of proportion.

157
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,831
They need to learn their lesson.

158
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,001
I hope this is the last time that
something like this happens

159
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:53,421
because I don't want any trouble.

160
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,631
We all loved Basil.

161
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:59,593
Let's extend that love to this baby.

162
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,346
Maybe not to me, but at least to the baby.

163
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,564
Be thankful nothing happened
to Beverly or my grandchild.

164
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,026
But I'm warning each and every one of you,

165
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:19,822
do not hurt my grandchild!

166
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,794
<i>It's something else.</i>

167
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,756
All of a sudden,
Beverly is Sir Galvan's favorite.

168
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,595
George, do we really have to
go to her party?

169
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,475
If I could have it my way,
I would rather rest,

170
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,602
but I don't want Papa to get angry.

171
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,354
George,

172
00:12:53,564 --> 00:12:57,026
were you the one who hurt Beverly?

173
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,779
Why would I do that?

174
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,617
Well, to scare her so she'd lose her baby.

175
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:09,830
Mother, I'm not that kind of person.

176
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,124
And besides, that's still Basil's child.

177
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,548
George,

178
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,468
can you really accept Beverly's child?

179
00:13:33,854 --> 00:13:35,105
Of course not. What's wrong with you?

180
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:38,192
That's a reminder of Basil's infidelity.

181
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:41,070
Why are you asking if your sister
can accept the baby?

182
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,739
Well, who knows? Maybe…

183
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,200
You're unbelievable.

184
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:00,798
Ma'am Rebecca?

185
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:05,052
What did your cards say?

186
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:10,057
Is Ma'am Bev's baby a boy or a girl?

187
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:15,521
I haven't consulted them yet.

188
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,357
Why don't you do this, ma'am?

189
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,109
Go find out

190
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,989
and then tell me.

191
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:28,367
Because I heard

192
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,288
that Sir Galvan said the person
who can guess it right

193
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,039
will win a prize.

194
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,545
Hey.

195
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:41,130
You're a scammer too.

196
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:43,132
You'll try to earn money using Ma'am.

197
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,219
But, you know, actually, I had a dream.

198
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,514
It said

199
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:56,979
that there would be two new members
of the Palacios family.

200
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,272
That's it.

201
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:03,861
Could those be the babies
of Ma'am Sam and Ma'am Bev?

202
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:08,449
Two Palacios babies.

203
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,209
Just two?

204
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:22,796
There are no extra Palacios
family members?

205
00:15:24,548 --> 00:15:26,091
Even those…

206
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,303
who are just half?

207
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,602
Chill.

208
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,604
Let me help you…

209
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:43,567
Mr. Palacios.

210
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:18,936
Peter,

211
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,479
let's go out for a while.

212
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:22,648
Let's go.

213
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:50,384
We already talked, right?

214
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,678
No one should know about what I told you.

215
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,931
I didn't tell anyone that
you were a Palacios.

216
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:58,892
What about your side remarks earlier?

217
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,186
And you even did it in front of Rebecca?!

218
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:04,690
Bro, it was just a joke.

219
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,984
Who knows? She might have said
you two were siblings.

220
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:08,777
Peter,

221
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,696
I'm not joking with you.

222
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:11,989
It was just a joke.

223
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,744
Why won't you tell people
your real identity?

224
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,249
No one can know the truth

225
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:25,085
until I've found out the real reason
mine and Rebecca's father died.

226
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,758
So that's why you're kind
to Ma'am Rebecca.

227
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,179
You have the same father.

228
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:39,683
Okay.

229
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,260
So this is it?

230
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:17,930
It's so small.

231
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:21,433
It looks like they rushed
the preparation for the party.

232
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,185
Oh well.

233
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:25,020
Anyway…

234
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,691
Basil used to be so competitive.
Right, Sam?

235
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,987
And now he's even got ahead of Paco
in having a baby.

236
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:34,988
But never mind.

237
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,867
When it's your turn, Sam,

238
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:40,202
I will throw

239
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:47,000
a bigger, grander gender reveal
for you and our baby.

240
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:51,421
Come with me. Come on.

241
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:54,508
Amando.

242
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,320
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Palacios,

243
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:19,199
but it will take a miracle
for you to bear a child.

244
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,870
There's really nothing we can do.

245
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,880
Mrs. Palacios, congratulations.

246
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,590
I'm not…

247
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,009
So sorry.

248
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,595
Hon, what's with you?
She's not the one who's pregnant.

249
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,388
It's the other woman.

250
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,764
Apologies.

251
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:44,766
- Come on, let's go.
- I didn't know.

252
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,996
Sam?

253
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:07,998
Where are you going?

254
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:10,125
The party hasn't started yet.

255
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,837
I will just drink my vitamins.
I'll be right back.

256
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:15,380
All right.

257
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,011
Stop crying.

258
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,848
It should have been me, Mother.

259
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,894
It should be me throwing this party.

260
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,520
I should be the one celebrating.

261
00:20:30,604 --> 00:20:33,482
I should be the one
they're congratulating.

262
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:37,653
How I wish I was the one who was pregnant.

263
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:42,491
George,

264
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:45,911
forgive me.

265
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,829
Forgive me.

266
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,041
It's my fault.

267
00:20:52,376 --> 00:20:54,002
It's not your fault, Mother.

268
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,545
Yes, it is my fault.

269
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:58,590
I forced you to go to Singapore.

270
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:03,387
And because of what happened to you there,
you've developed a problem in your uterus.

271
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:10,811
It's my fault you became infertile,
George. Forgive me.

272
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,899
Forgive me, George.

273
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,113
What am I going to do with this?

274
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:05,657
Book a ticket.

275
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,076
Leave the country.

276
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,828
Get as far away as you can.

277
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:13,206
What about our baby?

278
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,752
Beverly, can you please lower your voice?

279
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,754
Someone might hear you here.

280
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,137
How do I raise this baby?

281
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,014
This baby needs a father.

282
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,143
Okay.

283
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:34,269
Look.

284
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:37,439
I will give you everything.

285
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:43,820
Money, medical help, everything.

286
00:22:44,988 --> 00:22:47,616
But once you deliver that baby,

287
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,868
I will adopt him.

288
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:55,999
George and I will raise the baby
as if it were our own.

289
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,878
What will happen to me?

290
00:23:01,963 --> 00:23:04,091
You will live like royalty.

291
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,926
Like a queen.

292
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:10,806
Like a wealthy, single woman.

293
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:28,490
So your daddy's plan for us
will still push through.

294
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,951
We will live like royalty.

295
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,580
Only this time, in the real palace.

296
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,458
And one by one,

297
00:23:39,292 --> 00:23:41,795
we will take out the people here

298
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,548
until we're the only ones left.

299
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,204
Hi.

300
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:19,958
Wow, you're blooming.

301
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,044
I hope I'm like that too
when I'm five months pregnant.

302
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,214
This is for you.

303
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,934
That's a nanny cam.

304
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:41,229
I heard there was trouble
in your house last night.

305
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:42,939
Someone went inside your room.

306
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:45,692
Thank you.

307
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,866
Do you have any idea who did it?

308
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,474
I just leave it to God.

309
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:21,436
There's no point in going to war
with something petty as that.

310
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,774
Ward is right there.

311
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:28,151
- Do we have to do this?
- Yes.

312
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,614
You guys know what to say, okay?

313
00:25:35,075 --> 00:25:37,410
Why are there gate crashers here?

314
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,041
Ward?

315
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:48,880
We came here to apologize.

316
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,052
We didn't mean to offend you
or your family.

317
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:55,262
Yeah.

318
00:25:56,972 --> 00:25:58,932
Let me make it clear.

319
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,601
My sister is not a killer.

320
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,105
She would never do that to Basil.

321
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:07,065
She loved him so much.

322
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,233
All right, man.

323
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,610
We believe you.

324
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,028
Here.

325
00:26:13,655 --> 00:26:14,781
A peace offering.

326
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:17,951
What's this?

327
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,161
See for yourself.

328
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,214
We all have a pair.

329
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,050
That's the official gadget of Foursquad!

330
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,638
We will investigate the murder
of your brother-in-law.

331
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:41,224
I will teach you what to do.

332
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:44,519
I've read a lot of murder mysteries.

333
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,730
Go, Foursquad!

334
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,399
How about…

335
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,861
Crimebusters?

336
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,112
You too.

337
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,905
That's it. I think it's okay.

338
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:58,450
- Crimebusters, I guess.
- Wow, okay.

339
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,823
If that happened to me, I would get mad.

340
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:41,409
I mean there's no sense of peace.

341
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,787
No diplomacy.

342
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,914
If that happened to me,

343
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,958
I would definitely make her pay.

344
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:51,878
Her?

345
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:55,173
Do you think it's a woman
who did that to me?

346
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:59,594
George is denying
that she did something like that.

347
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:22,909
Aurora. How nice of you to come.

348
00:28:24,577 --> 00:28:28,706
One million jackpot prize
for the lucky guesser?

349
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:36,131
Galvan, you're really pulling out
all the stops for this party.

350
00:28:36,214 --> 00:28:39,342
Come on, Aurora,
it's not just another party.

351
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,138
It's like the rebirth of Basil.

352
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,932
Oh, I know exactly how you feel.

353
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:52,105
Because I felt the same way
when I found out that Sam was pregnant.

354
00:29:02,657 --> 00:29:07,579
A piece of advice
from one pregnant woman to another.

355
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:12,041
Please protect yourself.

356
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,462
Protect your child.

357
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:19,132
You have no idea.

358
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:24,512
Some people are just bitter because
they can't conceive a baby.

359
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:29,726
George is infertile?

360
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,644
Oh my God.

361
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,482
Don't tell me you don't know?

362
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:41,821
Beverly, please promise me
you won't tell George.

363
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,158
I won't.

364
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,577
Now, I understand.

365
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:49,788
She can't conceive.

366
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:51,539
That's why she's mad at me.

367
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:02,634
I almost forgot that Sam's brother
poisoned Basil.

368
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:06,304
That bastard is already in jail, Galvan.

369
00:30:07,514 --> 00:30:09,349
What else do you want?

370
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,101
Justice.

371
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,480
Vindication.

372
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,322
Do you think…

373
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,242
Do you think Basil knew?

374
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,203
Of course!

375
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,372
That's why he's protective of me.

376
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:33,957
I'm his only hope.

377
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:38,169
I can't imagine how he was able to accept

378
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,881
that his own wife
couldn't give him a child.

379
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,219
That must have been really hard
for him to accept.

380
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,182
That is if…

381
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,519
he really accepted it.

382
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:07,907
Ma'am, didn't you get the memo?

383
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,869
If it's blue, boy.

384
00:31:10,952 --> 00:31:12,662
If pink, girl.

385
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:13,788
Well…

386
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:17,750
This is what my card tells me to wear.

387
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:20,920
So what gender is black?

388
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,382
Well, my cards never lie.

389
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:36,436
Oh well.

390
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,982
I guess we'll never know…

391
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:45,987
because Basil

392
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,365
was murdered.

393
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:17,143
Settle down, everyone.

394
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,319
All right!

395
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:28,363
Is everyone excited?

396
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:29,697
Yes.

397
00:32:29,781 --> 00:32:31,282
Five!

398
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,659
Four!

399
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,743
Oh my gosh.

400
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,619
Three!

401
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:35,995
Yes!

402
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,121
Two!

403
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,999
One!

404
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,628
- It's a boy!
- Yes!

405
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:47,757
- It's a boy! It's a boy!
- Congratulations!

406
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,133
Yes!

407
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,807
- Aurora, it's a boy!
- Thank you.

408
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,352
- A rightful heir!
- Thank you.

409
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,896
- Congratulations.
- Thank you!

410
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,524
- Proud grandfather!
- Thank you!

411
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,819
Oh, yes, I'm so excited.

412
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,572
I'm going to have a grandchild!
He's a boy!

413
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,448
You're here.

414
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,285
For you, not for her.

415
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,541
I guess we should choose
the lucky guesser.

416
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:22,750
All right, all right, let's do it.

417
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,002
Let's do it, come on!

418
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:26,671
- For the grand prize!
- Come on.

419
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,882
You know what? I've had enough of this.

420
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:32,218
I'll have some coffee outside.
Care to join me?

421
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:33,678
Let's go!

422
00:33:35,471 --> 00:33:37,223
Shake!

423
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,816
It's George!

424
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,910
George, you won a million.

425
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,416
George, come!

426
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,710
Get your prize.

427
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,171
One million pesos.

428
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:10,006
- Yes!
- It's okay, Pa.

429
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:12,425
You can give that to someone else.

430
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,136
Are you rejecting the blessing?

431
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,680
But that's for you.

432
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,308
I said I don't want it.

433
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:24,687
Just take it as a consolation.

434
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:29,984
Or you can use this money
for you to buy a baby…

435
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,247
since you can never conceive one.

436
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:51,380
What?

437
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:55,885
George cannot conceive a baby?

438
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:02,058
They didn't know that you're barren?

439
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,880
Is this true?

440
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,509
George is barren?

441
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:40,930
That's not true. Beverly is lying.

442
00:35:43,224 --> 00:35:45,017
Since when did I lie?

443
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:49,147
When I said that
Basil and I were having a baby,

444
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,149
I was telling the truth.

445
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,693
And the DNA test confirmed it.

446
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:55,820
I may be a mistress,

447
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,697
but I'm not a liar,

448
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,824
unlike you.

449
00:36:09,167 --> 00:36:13,588
Both of you, let's discuss this privately.

450
00:36:14,422 --> 00:36:16,215
It's embarrassing to the guests.

451
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:20,469
George is more embarrassing
because she's lying to everyone.

452
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,847
Shut up!

453
00:36:23,431 --> 00:36:25,850
Your daughter is infertile.
She never could have given Basil a child!

454
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:27,351
You shut up.

455
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:29,395
You don't know what you're talking about.

456
00:36:29,478 --> 00:36:30,980
But I do, George.

457
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:32,356
I do.

458
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,692
And that's the thing about the truth.

459
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,861
It stings like a bitch!

460
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:41,532
George, let's go.

461
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:43,910
Maybe the rumors were true.

462
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:50,666
When Basil found out that
George couldn't give him a child,

463
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,752
he wanted to leave her.

464
00:36:54,795 --> 00:36:56,881
That's why you killed him.

465
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,553
George, don't mind her.

466
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,139
Come on, let's go.

467
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,349
Let's go.

468
00:37:12,146 --> 00:37:13,981
- George! George!
- Sam…

469
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,025
- Come here!
- George!

470
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:18,402
- George!
- George, drop that, please.

471
00:37:18,945 --> 00:37:20,029
George.

472
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,448
Get away from her!

473
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:24,533
Don't come near us!

474
00:37:24,617 --> 00:37:27,745
I swear to God, I will stab this woman!

475
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:28,996
George, please.

476
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,082
Please, please, don't kill me.

477
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:35,127
Look who's begging now.

478
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,338
After humiliating me,

479
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,714
after embarrassing me,

480
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:41,425
why would I give you an inch of mercy?

481
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:42,677
George, drop that.

482
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,221
You're not a killer.

483
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,098
George.

484
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,516
George, please.

485
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,686
George, listen to me, please.

486
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:53,896
Drop that, please.

487
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:01,696
Please.

488
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:02,989
- George.
- No!

489
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,450
George…

490
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:10,246
Let's go.

491
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:19,171
You better thank your God
I'm not the killer you think I am!

492
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,684
- Beverly, are you okay?
- Yes.

493
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:32,810
- Do you want water?
- No.

494
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,145
What do you want?

495
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:36,147
Wow.

496
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:39,608
That's quite a scene she made there.

497
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:44,989
It seems like George is
more than capable of killing.

498
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:46,949
What do you think, Amando?

499
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:04,633
How did she find out about my condition?

500
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,510
I don't know, George.

501
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:09,138
Give your sister a glass of water first.

502
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:10,765
What about you, Ward?

503
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,892
Maybe you told your friends.

504
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:17,646
Remember, that Sofia and her mother,
Vivian, are very talkative!

505
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,023
Be careful.

506
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:22,401
Ma, I don't tell them about our secrets.

507
00:39:22,485 --> 00:39:24,278
You better make sure you don't.

508
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:29,742
What I did is embarrassing.
What will they think of me?

509
00:39:30,117 --> 00:39:32,870
George, they will forget about it.

510
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:35,623
Mother, I almost hurt Beverly.

511
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,249
Because she humiliated you.

512
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:39,168
In your shoes,
I would've done the same thing.

513
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,799
George, don't do that again, okay?

514
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:48,469
You had me worried.
I thought you would kill her.

515
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:51,639
I don't want you to go to jail, George.

516
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,396
I'm sorry, Ward. I promise that
it will never happen again.

517
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:01,273
Don't apologize to me, George.

518
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:04,193
Apologize to Beverly and Sir Galvan.

519
00:40:12,743 --> 00:40:14,537
Attorney, I will send you the video.

520
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,997
I was able to record George
going berserk at the party.

521
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:19,875
All right.

522
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:20,876
Bye.

523
00:40:32,054 --> 00:40:33,305
I knew it.

524
00:40:34,348 --> 00:40:36,976
You had something to do with
what happened earlier.

525
00:40:38,352 --> 00:40:39,603
Have a seat first.

526
00:40:41,147 --> 00:40:42,481
How are you feeling?

527
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:43,315
Peter!

528
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,567
Peter!

529
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,901
Are you okay?

530
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,654
Prepare the car.

531
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,197
We're going to the hospital.

532
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,824
Yes, sir.

533
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,576
Uncle, there's no need.

534
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:55,744
I wasn't hurt physically.

535
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:57,163
But…

536
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,832
what about the baby? Are you sure?

537
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,167
He's fine.

538
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:02,918
Here, feel him.

539
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:08,883
I just wouldn't know what to do

540
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,594
if something bad happened
to you and my grandson.

541
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,846
We're okay.

542
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,431
We just got a fright.

543
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:21,020
Sir, earlier, Ma'am George's eyes
were so angry.

544
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,315
It seemed like she was ready to kill.

545
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,400
Oh, please.

546
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:29,195
Don't remind me of it.
I just want to forget about it.

547
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,781
I'll take care of it.

548
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,784
No one will hurt you again.

549
00:41:48,255 --> 00:41:50,007
Don't lie anymore, Sam.

550
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:54,345
Mother, I need to expose George's secrets.

551
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,597
It's like the domino effect.

552
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,474
One will fall after another

553
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:02,102
until the truth comes out that she was
the mastermind behind Basil's death.

554
00:42:02,186 --> 00:42:04,355
Someone almost got hurt
because of your plan.

555
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,982
People are bound to get hurt, Mother.

556
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:09,818
This is war,
and Francis was the first casualty.

557
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:10,986
That's the thing.

558
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:12,655
Your brother got dragged into it first.

559
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,657
And now it's Beverly.

560
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:16,325
Who's next?

561
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:17,576
Will it be me, Sam?

562
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,912
Mother, I'm doing all of this

563
00:42:20,412 --> 00:42:23,165
so that I can find out who killed Basil

564
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,001
because I want my brother
to get out of jail.

565
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,420
But what is the price of his freedom?

566
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:33,467
Are you going to become like
the people you hate?

567
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,346
Mother, I love my brother!

568
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,558
There's nothing I wouldn't do
if it meant he'd be free!

569
00:42:42,101 --> 00:42:45,354
If your idea of
being a good mother to my brother

570
00:42:45,437 --> 00:42:51,485
is to do nothing but blame me
and say it's my fault that he is in jail,

571
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:59,410
then let me, as his older sister, help him
and do everything I can to free him.

572
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:15,134
Wait. Where are you taking my things?

573
00:43:15,884 --> 00:43:16,802
Ma'am…

574
00:43:17,886 --> 00:43:21,307
Ma'am, I'm sorry.
We're just following orders.

575
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,976
Who told you to touch my things?

576
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,065
I did.

577
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:33,986
Pa?

578
00:43:35,362 --> 00:43:38,324
I asked them to transfer
your things and your family

579
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:40,200
to the condo in Makati.

580
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,287
You're kicking me out?

581
00:43:53,255 --> 00:43:54,923
George has been missing for a while now.

582
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,467
She isn't answering my texts.

583
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,218
Why do you look like that?

584
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,219
What happened to you?

585
00:43:59,762 --> 00:44:01,263
Francis, are you okay?

586
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:03,349
Well, I'm getting used to this.

587
00:44:03,432 --> 00:44:05,267
Actually, I'm already ready.

588
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,770
Ready for what, Francis?

589
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,854
NEXT EPISODE

590
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:10,773
I'm ready to die.

591
00:44:10,856 --> 00:44:13,192
What are you looking at
in the other house?

592
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,069
Sir Galvan is going amok.

593
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:18,489
Maybe what's happening
is a serious problem.

594
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:20,866
<i>Sofia!</i>

595
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:21,784
<i>What's wrong?</i>
