1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:18,560
Your stupid father died
of a drug overdose.

2
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:20,228
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:22,063
I heard you and Sir Galvan.

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,274
<i>You were talking on the third floor.</i>

5
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:25,734
<i>No matter what you say,</i>

6
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,153
no one will believe you in court.

7
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:29,738
Because you have no proof,

8
00:00:30,363 --> 00:00:32,032
while I have.

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:34,743
<i>I will lock you up.</i>

10
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:37,203
Go ahead and continue that.

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:39,748
Just one touch
and this will go live on social media.

12
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:40,874
- Amando.
- Don't.

13
00:00:40,957 --> 00:00:43,418
Francis, give that to him. Francis, don't.

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,462
I could get in trouble
with what I'm about to do.

15
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,465
You indeed got pregnant before,
Ma'am Rebecca.

16
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:50,175
Are you telling the truth?

17
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:53,720
I saw your picture
while you were pregnant.

18
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,889
<i>Sir Amando saw us.</i>

19
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:58,141
<i>That's why Ma'am Aurora fired us.</i>

20
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,102
<i>Ma'am, promise me you won't tell them</i>
<i>that I told you.</i>

21
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,313
Ma'am Aurora will kill me.

22
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:05,106
<i>Auntie Aurora sent a message.</i>

23
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,192
It was Sam who pushed Paco.

24
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,152
Maybe she's the real Palacios killer?

25
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,945
Maybe she did poison Basil.

26
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:11,946
<i>Why do you want to do it now?</i>

27
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:13,448
<i>I keep hearing my babies crying.</i>

28
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,574
<i>That's why I want to know the truth now.</i>

29
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:15,992
Your Auntie Aurora is not here.

30
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,578
But, it's late. Where is she?

31
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,607
Rebecca…

32
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,734
she's not here.

33
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,532
Well…

34
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:57,992
it's a good thing she's not here.

35
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:01,871
It's easier for us to look for evidence.

36
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,540
Let's go. Go look over there.

37
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:04,499
Okay.

38
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:18,888
Rebecca.

39
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,182
Rebecca.

40
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,104
Yes?

41
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,647
This is the drawer that's locked.

42
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:43,788
Here. There is a box.

43
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:51,629
These are all pictures of Auntie and Paco.

44
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:54,048
Look some more.

45
00:02:59,137 --> 00:03:00,263
What are you doing here?

46
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:07,812
Are you still covering up for her?

47
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:09,230
Mom, no.

48
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,149
I can't remember.

49
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:14,235
But why is your reaction like that, Paco?

50
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,987
What should my reaction be, Mom?

51
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:21,951
You have evidence
that I was pushed by my wife, so?

52
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,747
I am here now.

53
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,207
Stuck in this hell hole.

54
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,002
You should get mad.

55
00:03:31,961 --> 00:03:33,838
You said it yourself, Paco.

56
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:37,217
You're stuck here because of that woman.

57
00:03:38,676 --> 00:03:40,553
Do you know what she said?

58
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:44,307
She said you jumped
off the cliff and you wanted to take her.

59
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,017
What?

60
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:50,813
I would never kill myself.

61
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,608
I know you won't.

62
00:03:54,317 --> 00:03:56,361
Son, I know you won't.

63
00:03:56,986 --> 00:03:58,196
So, please…

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,990
don't sit there

65
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:05,703
and act as if Samantha did nothing to you
because she did.

66
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,521
I want to talk to Auntie Aurora.

67
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:34,148
How about you? What are you doing here?

68
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,359
I am Ma'am Aurora's right-hand man.

69
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:39,404
It's my obligation to check if she's okay.

70
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,990
Why do you want to talk
to your Auntie Aurora?

71
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:45,410
Because I want to know
where you took my twins.

72
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:50,415
I can see in your eyes
that you're hiding something.

73
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,544
Nothing. Get out of here.

74
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:57,046
Don't add to Ma'am Aurora's worries.

75
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,464
Come on. Get out of here.

76
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,801
Your eyes…

77
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,725
I see…

78
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,644
No… Jericho is right.

79
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,063
You know something.
I can see it in your eyes.

80
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:16,065
Amando, please tell me the truth. Please.

81
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,276
Please tell me,
where did Auntie Aurora take my twins?

82
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:19,360
Please. Please.

83
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,571
Stop it, Ma'am Rebecca.

84
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,865
There's no child I can tell you about.

85
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,367
You didn't get pregnant.
You didn't give birth.

86
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,994
- No, no, no. Please.
- Get out of here.

87
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:29,037
- Please tell me.
- Please.

88
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,204
- I'm begging you, Amando.
- Get out of here.

89
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,790
- Amando, tell me the truth.
- Get out of here.

90
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,459
- Rebecca, that's enough.
- Hold on.

91
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:37,211
That fool will not admit it.

92
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:38,796
He is a minion of Auntie Aurora.

93
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,382
What did you say?

94
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,010
I don't think you're deaf.

95
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:49,640
- Jericho, please. Let's look for them.
- Come on, let's go.

96
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,225
Come on.

97
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:23,966
You were right, Sam.

98
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:27,470
We can fight this for self-defense.

99
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,972
They can say you did it intentionally.

100
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:32,683
But for me, it tells self-defense.

101
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:37,688
Still, it's the court who will decide.

102
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,693
Do you think we stand a chance?

103
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,324
I'm getting pissed with Rebecca.

104
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,700
She's annoying.

105
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,703
Well, Amando, whatever happens,

106
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,123
don't ever admit anything about her twins.

107
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:57,250
She'll get tired of asking.

108
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:01,003
I will take care of it, madam.
I won't let her go near you.

109
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:18,813
What the hell
are you doing here, Attorney?

110
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,232
- I'm representing Sam.
- No.

111
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,444
You're not representing that woman.

112
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,031
George, what's with you?

113
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,867
Please don't follow Sam.

114
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,827
Mom, I need to make sure

115
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,871
that she poisoned Basil.

116
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:36,831
Do you think she'll answer you?

117
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:38,499
She used to be my friend.

118
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,252
I'll be able to see
whether she's lying or not.

119
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,714
But, that woman is very good at lying.

120
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,258
She was even successful
in making it look like she was innocent.

121
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:52,472
Well, let's see if she can still manage
to lie with my hands.

122
00:07:57,602 --> 00:08:00,146
Wow…

123
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,273
Well played.

124
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,692
That's a good game plan.

125
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,990
I'm sorry, Mrs. Palacios, but…

126
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,493
No buts, Attorney Quintanar.

127
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,287
I'm the one paying you, Attorney.

128
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,915
So, I will call the shots.

129
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:24,504
You are paying me
to represent your daughter-in-law,

130
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:27,924
and that is what I've been doing,
then and now.

131
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,718
Mom…

132
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,555
I need to defend myself,

133
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,351
especially as what happened to Paco
was an accident.

134
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,104
But if you don't want…

135
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,982
I'm not talking to you, Samantha,

136
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,193
so don't answer.

137
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,655
You…

138
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:55,326
I will pay you double, triple.

139
00:08:55,409 --> 00:08:56,452
No.

140
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,162
Name your price.

141
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:00,790
Just don't help this woman.

142
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,668
It's a miracle.

143
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,462
Why does it seem like your tongue shrinks?

144
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:10,675
Vivian, my tongue never shrinks.

145
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,093
Please, shut up.

146
00:09:12,176 --> 00:09:15,137
Mind your own business.
Scratch your own itch, okay?

147
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,514
Let's go, George.

148
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:18,724
Hey, let me join you.

149
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:21,269
Didn't I say mind your own business?

150
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,354
Is that so?

151
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:24,772
Ouch.

152
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,940
What the heck?

153
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,233
Vivian, that hurt.

154
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:30,152
These earrings cost ten thousand pesos,
and you would destroy them?

155
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:32,113
Really?

156
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:34,365
- What now?
- Hey.

157
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,534
Let go of Mom, Vivian.

158
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,335
Please do not insult me, Mrs. Palacios.

159
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:48,754
I may not be as rich as you,

160
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:50,923
but I am also rich.

161
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:56,345
In fact, I am also considering
representing Sam pro bono.

162
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:04,103
You see, I have this reputation of…

163
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,148
fighting for the underdogs.

164
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,610
She's not an underdog.

165
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,570
She's a criminal.

166
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:15,323
She killed my son.

167
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,746
Don't you lay a hand on my client,

168
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:23,164
not even a finger.

169
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:26,375
Or else, I will sue you
for harassment, assault, and battery.

170
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,169
And I will make sure that I will win.

171
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,004
You know I will win.

172
00:10:30,671 --> 00:10:34,050
And I will tell the court
that Paco Palacios

173
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,219
inherited his violent streaks.

174
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:41,265
And that video that you made viral,

175
00:10:44,101 --> 00:10:46,687
which, by the way,
is also a case for cyberbullying,

176
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:49,732
can help me to prove that your son

177
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:53,110
attacked my client.

178
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,364
He wanted her to take him to the cliff.

179
00:10:56,447 --> 00:11:01,118
That's why Sam pushed him in self-defense.

180
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,705
That's enough, madam.

181
00:11:07,124 --> 00:11:11,754
You are a traitor, Attorney Quintanar.

182
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:13,756
You're a traitor.

183
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,972
You are a bully, Madam Aurora Palacios.

184
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,530
Galvan, good thing you arrived.

185
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:39,615
They were ganging up on me.

186
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,117
Dad, that's not true.

187
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,868
Yes, George. And I was just quiet here.

188
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,413
What do you mean no?
There were two of them. I was alone.

189
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,540
Enough! Pack your things.

190
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:52,128
I will send you and Sofia to Baguio.
You'll stay there first.

191
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:54,964
No, Galvan. I don't want to stay there.

192
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,590
I warned you.

193
00:11:56,674 --> 00:11:57,967
You're just making trouble here.

194
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,635
No, Galvan.

195
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,720
Didn't I tell you that I will change?

196
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:03,973
I'll be quiet and decent.

197
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,766
It's not safe here. There is a killer.

198
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,561
Aren't you worried about Sofia?

199
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:12,481
Then send Sofia to Baguio,
so she can be safe there.

200
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,651
No. I've made up my mind.

201
00:12:15,734 --> 00:12:17,153
You're going back to Baguio

202
00:12:17,736 --> 00:12:20,990
in the hopes that your attitude
will cool down.

203
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:24,368
I'll ask the security
to go with you so you'll be safe.

204
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,871
I don't want to go to Baguio.
It's so boring there.

205
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,373
Pack your things now.

206
00:12:46,765 --> 00:12:48,017
No.

207
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,102
No. No. No.

208
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,062
No.

209
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,861
I went here to cool my head.

210
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:01,363
But, it turns out your head is hotter.

211
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,782
Why? What happened to you?

212
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,410
I threw Vivian out.

213
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,537
She hurt George.

214
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:13,000
It's about time, Galvan.

215
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:17,046
Now we can lessen the mess
here in our estate.

216
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,800
Oh, wait…

217
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:26,388
You chose George over your mistress?

218
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,015
Why?

219
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,268
I don't want George to get stressed.

220
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:35,814
She's pregnant.

221
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,193
What?

222
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,030
Another Palacios?

223
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:44,657
Yes.

224
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,786
Another threat to your throne.

225
00:13:50,746 --> 00:13:54,124
There are two heirs
of Palacios Mining on my side.

226
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,336
My daughter and my grandson.

227
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,381
While you only have one.

228
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:06,762
You are outnumbered again, Aurora.

229
00:14:17,982 --> 00:14:20,609
Only your mom is asked
to go back to Baguio?

230
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,363
I hate Dad, Ward.

231
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,365
He's becoming a monster.

232
00:14:27,408 --> 00:14:28,576
I'd rather go with my mom.

233
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,788
I will miss you.

234
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:38,127
Hey. Hey. Ward. What's that?

235
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,421
- Why are you holding my daughter's hand?
- Mom.

236
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:41,338
That's not allowed.

237
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:53,475
Good thing I came here.
My head is cooler now.

238
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:56,437
But anyway…

239
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,523
How about you? Who are you
raging war with over the phone?

240
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,859
My useless lawyers.

241
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:04,028
All of them, they all agreed

242
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:08,157
that Sam has a strong case
of self-defense.

243
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,076
You can't do anything?

244
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:13,454
How can you put Sam behind bars?

245
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,748
I don't know.

246
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:21,378
My useless lawyers discouraged me

247
00:15:21,462 --> 00:15:23,380
to file for murder.

248
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:26,425
We can only file
for obstruction of justice.

249
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:30,763
Galvan, that's only six years maximum.

250
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:37,978
So, all your efforts
in looking for evidence are wasted.

251
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,775
Anyway, where did you get that video?

252
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,027
Well, from the laptop of…

253
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:10,886
<i>I didn't kill Dr. Orly.</i>

254
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,684
From your son's laptop.

255
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,687
Why does Basil have a copy?

256
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:21,689
Why didn't he release it?

257
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:25,317
Did he take the video?

258
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,697
Did he connive with Sam to kill my son?

259
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:32,700
What?

260
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,871
Did you know about this, Galvan?

261
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:41,500
Did you and Basil plan this?

262
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:45,087
You paid Sam to get rid of my son?

263
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:46,714
No.

264
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,884
Basil and I did not connive
with Sam to kill Paco.

265
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:52,261
Really?

266
00:16:52,928 --> 00:16:55,764
Then explain to me
why Basil hid the video,

267
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,600
and did not release it

268
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:00,728
during the investigation.

269
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,896
Is this yours and Basil's insurance

270
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:05,315
so Sam won't betray you?

271
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,650
No.

272
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:09,987
For God's sake,
we would never do that to Paco.

273
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:13,407
- Mom…
- Come here.

274
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,826
- Ms. Vivian.
- Your family is the reason

275
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:18,328
why we're being kicked out of the mansion.

276
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,330
And now you flirt with my daughter.

277
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,332
- Mom.
- You're so shameless.

278
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,334
- You're all the same, you and your family.
- Mom.

279
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:25,919
He's not doing anything, Mom.

280
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,671
What do you mean
by not doing anything? Stop it. You too.

281
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,340
Stop flirting with my daughter.

282
00:17:30,424 --> 00:17:32,718
Do you understand?

283
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,012
- Hey, Vivian. What's that?
- I don't want to…

284
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:35,929
- What?
- Mom…

285
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,723
- What's your problem?
- Don't hurt my brother.

286
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,349
You're really a fool.

287
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,480
Aurora, you once said, and I do remember…

288
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,648
our family is dysfunctional.

289
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:49,985
We fight and patch things up,
but we don't kill each other.

290
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,820
That's just me, Galvan.

291
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,988
Me and Paco.

292
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:56,158
We may hate you and Basil,

293
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,202
but we will never kill you.

294
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,912
We're just the same.

295
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,999
No matter what happens, we're family.

296
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,212
Killing each other is off the table.

297
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,839
We'll see about that.

298
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,979
- George, that's enough. Let's not fight.
- No.

299
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,482
I'm just trying to be patient
with this woman.

300
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:30,609
She can hurt me, but not you and Mom.

301
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:33,112
You are all pests in my life.

302
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:34,696
You're termites and bugs.

303
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,198
- You talk too much.
- Mom.

304
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,118
- Get out of here.
- Auntie.

305
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,704
- Listen to what I have to say.
- Sure.

306
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,499
- Mom.
- All of you, listen to what I have to say.

307
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,794
George is pregnant.

308
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:49,878
Mom.

309
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,630
She's pregnant.

310
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:56,009
I don't know who or what demon

311
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,220
that witch prayed to

312
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,471
because she's barren, right?

313
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:00,597
- She's barren.
- Mom.

314
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:04,184
But now, she's pregnant?

315
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:06,937
What's that?

316
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,023
So, all of you gossip about it,

317
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,484
spread it,

318
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:14,695
Post it on social media to make it viral

319
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,781
so it would reach the Palacios killer

320
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:19,992
- that George is pregnant.
- Mom.

321
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,121
Well, not unless one of them
is the killer.

322
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:27,624
Spread it and tell him

323
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,460
that he has a new target.

324
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,046
Because the baby in her womb

325
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,883
has Palacios blood.

326
00:19:35,966 --> 00:19:39,094
- So, let the killings begin.
- Mom.

327
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,014
- Get out of here.
- Mom, let's go.

328
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,099
You're the one who's dead.

329
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,020
She's about to leave
and yet she's causing trouble.

330
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:50,522
That witch is something else.

331
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:52,316
Now, she wants

332
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:54,026
the Palacios killer to kill your baby.

333
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,528
This woman really is something.

334
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:01,909
Let me remind you, Ms. Samantha.

335
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:05,704
You may face a case
of obstruction of justice.

336
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:09,499
This time I want you to be truthful.

337
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,710
Samantha.

338
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,923
Mrs. Palacios, I'm interviewing
Ms. Samantha.

339
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:20,510
I just want
to ask her something, Detective.

340
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:22,262
Aurora, you cannot just barge in.

341
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,513
Oh, shut up.

342
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:29,102
Sam, did you connive
with Basil and Galvan?

343
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,981
Connive about what?

344
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,944
Don't play dumb.

345
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:41,323
The issue here
is you pushing Paco off the cliff.

346
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,741
So, answer me.

347
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,994
Did you connive with Basil and Galvan?

348
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,412
Did they order you?

349
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,123
Sam, do not answer that.

350
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,173
I did not connive with anyone else.

351
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,635
See? I told you

352
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:03,345
there was no connivance.

353
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:06,765
We did not have Paco killed by that woman.

354
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,267
I don't believe you.

355
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,644
Basil wouldn't hide the video

356
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,939
if he didn't have anything
to do with what you both did.

357
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:18,527
Let me repeat it.
What happened was an accident.

358
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:20,153
You heard her.

359
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,739
And it's evident in the video.

360
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,743
Do you know anything about the video, Sam?

361
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:29,121
Because if you did not connive with Basil,

362
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:32,749
why he's hiding it?

363
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,383
I will ask you about that, Ms. Samantha.

364
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:43,927
Do you know about the video?

365
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,765
Yes, I know about the video.

366
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,892
How did you find out?

367
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,103
Basil showed it to me.

368
00:21:53,186 --> 00:21:54,938
Why did he show it to you?

369
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:58,942
Because he threatened me.

370
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,319
What do you mean he threatened you?

371
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,616
He threatened to release the video
if I didn't do what he wanted me to do.

372
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,416
That's blackmail.

373
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,168
That's not true.

374
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,670
Basil wouldn't do that.

375
00:22:18,754 --> 00:22:19,671
Get out of my way.

376
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:20,881
I said get out of my way.

377
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:22,466
Stop it, Galvan.

378
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,260
Assaulting a police officer is a crime.
Stop it.

379
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:28,680
Sergeant Royales,

380
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:33,226
I am both a lawyer
and a witness at this time.

381
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,438
Should you want
to retain my services as a lawyer,

382
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:39,858
we can file a case
against Galvan Palacios.

383
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,653
Just say the word.

384
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,409
That woman is really an animal.

385
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,788
Now the Palacios killer might target you.

386
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,539
It's your fault.

387
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:56,249
I've told you several times

388
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,752
to stay away from Sofia.

389
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:00,587
And you're blaming me, Mom?

390
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,173
It's you who won't stop fighting
with Ms. Vivian.

391
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:07,719
I wouldn't fight her
if she didn't pick on you,

392
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,012
and if she didn't pick on me.

393
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:12,808
What? Do you want me
to just let her slap you?

394
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,103
Ward, if there's one person here

395
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,064
who has the right to slap you, it's me.

396
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,858
Will you both stop.

397
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,237
But, Mom, you're too much.

398
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:30,742
Your accusations against Ms. Vivian,
that's what you're doing too.

399
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,327
You're just like her, Mom.

400
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,790
You're rude.

401
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:39,918
Just say the word.

402
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,337
No need, Attorney.

403
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,008
I need you to respect my position here.

404
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,510
If you repeat what you did

405
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:50,637
and disrespect me,

406
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:53,557
I don't need to sue you
for you to go to jail.

407
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:56,726
I will handcuff you and take you to jail.

408
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:04,901
Now, you may leave.

409
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,238
You too, Mrs. Palacios.

410
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,448
Wait, I'm not yet done.

411
00:24:10,532 --> 00:24:13,535
Sam, why is Basil blackmailing you?

412
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:15,370
What did he ask you to do?

413
00:24:17,289 --> 00:24:20,709
I didn't raise you to disrespect me.

414
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,837
Mom, that's enough.

415
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,714
Don't pick on Ward.

416
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:28,550
It's really your fault.

417
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:31,428
I told you not to tell anyone,

418
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,806
but you told Dad.
That's why it reached Vivian.

419
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:36,391
George…

420
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,769
I was just protecting you.

421
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:42,022
If I didn't say anything,
you might have fallen

422
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:45,483
from the stairs
when Sir Galvan dragged you.

423
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,987
I am just protecting you
and my grandchild.

424
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,241
But, there's a different way…

425
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,993
to stop Dad.

426
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,161
That's right.

427
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,831
So, you're ganging up on me now.
Is that it?

428
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,374
Mom, no.

429
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,211
We're just telling you your mistake.

430
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,671
There's nothing wrong with what I did.

431
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:10,175
Mom, please. Just accept your mistakes.

432
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,677
No.

433
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,430
I am not wrong

434
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,227
because it's not wrong
to protect you, my family,

435
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,895
that I love so much.

436
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,027
Ma'am, we're done.

437
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:31,738
I am the one asking Ms. Samantha, not you.

438
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:33,657
Please.

439
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,174
I'm sorry, Mom.

440
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,219
I didn't mean to answer you back.

441
00:25:56,513 --> 00:25:58,223
George, let's not fight anymore.

442
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,017
I'm sorry too, Mom.

443
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,854
I'm sorry too, my children.

444
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,275
I know I'm not perfect,

445
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,319
but remember,

446
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:14,614
I wouldn't do something intentional

447
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:16,491
to put you in danger.

448
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:20,161
We're the only allies here.

449
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,665
Next time, George and Mom,

450
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,625
let's be extra careful.

451
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,003
George…

452
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:32,716
I promise, I'll protect the baby.

453
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:50,191
You've been restless.

454
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,569
What happened in the interview?

455
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,660
Mother, I had to confess to the blackmail,

456
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,582
but I'm nervous because
Sergeant Royales will definitely dig up

457
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,751
the issue of poisoning Basil.

458
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:10,420
They will suspect me again.

459
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,090
Mother, I'm scared.

460
00:27:14,174 --> 00:27:15,508
I'm sure they'll find out

461
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,303
that I placed Francis' morphine

462
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:20,013
in George's room.

463
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:22,682
Sam?

464
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:34,110
You did that?

465
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,577
Sergeant Casas knew

466
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:45,372
that I placed that in George's room.

467
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,793
That's how they had evidence against me.

468
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,836
That's why I was imprisoned.

469
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:54,964
Sam, it was you who put it there?

470
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,843
You're the reason I went to jail?

471
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,683
- Mom?
- What?

472
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:08,561
What if Ward and Sofia end up together?

473
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:11,022
Vivian will become your in-law?

474
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,065
George…

475
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:18,279
Well, there's nothing I can do
but accept it.

476
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,073
I'm willing to make a sacrifice

477
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:22,951
for the happiness of my children.

478
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:26,287
You're too serious, Mother.

479
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:28,456
There you go again calling me Mother.

480
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,251
Didn't I tell you to call me Mom?
It's embarrassing to the dragonfly.

481
00:28:32,669 --> 00:28:33,753
But, son, I already stopped

482
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,674
your sister and Abdul from being together.

483
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,926
I will not do that again.

484
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,512
Vivian.

485
00:28:42,595 --> 00:28:46,641
If something happens to my grandchild,
I will never forgive you.

486
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,983
Sam, I'm asking you.

487
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,944
Francis…

488
00:28:58,903 --> 00:29:00,864
Francis, forgive me.

489
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,243
I really didn't know
what to do that night.

490
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,705
Basil threatened that he would
release the video

491
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,707
if I did not do what he wanted.

492
00:29:11,666 --> 00:29:13,168
So, even if I got in trouble,

493
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,920
you used my morphine.

494
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,548
Francis, I didn't know that would happen.

495
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:21,217
I thought… I thought it would be George
who would be in trouble.

496
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:22,385
I thought she was the one
who would go to jail.

497
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:24,345
I thought they would accuse her.

498
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,557
I'm sorry. Francis, I'm sorry.

499
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:31,227
Francis, I'm sorry.

500
00:29:40,487 --> 00:29:43,531
Pray hard that my grandchild will be safe

501
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,326
because I will get Sofia from you

502
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:49,746
and you will never see her again.

503
00:29:51,956 --> 00:29:54,709
Dad… stop that.

504
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:56,836
I'm sorry, George.

505
00:29:57,462 --> 00:30:00,590
I didn't know
that Vivian was spreading your pregnancy.

506
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,802
There's nothing we can do
about it anymore.

507
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,304
But, don't worry. I'll be careful.

508
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:09,182
She should be thankful that she's not here

509
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:11,601
because I might have strangled her.

510
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,979
Especially now that I want
to kill someone.

511
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,440
Why, Sir Galvan?

512
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:20,985
The video of Paco being pushed

513
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,112
came from Basil's laptop.

514
00:30:23,947 --> 00:30:27,408
And Sam said to Sergeant Royales

515
00:30:27,951 --> 00:30:30,078
that she was blackmailed by Basil.

516
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,247
- What?
- Yes.

517
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,249
She involved Basil.

518
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:36,918
That woman is an animal.

519
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:39,170
She will destroy my husband's reputation?

520
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:42,674
George, where are you going?

521
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:45,051
To Samantha Castillo-Palacios.

522
00:30:45,134 --> 00:30:47,053
I will confront that woman.

523
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,268
Do you know what kind of hell
I experienced in prison, huh?

524
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:58,106
Every night the criminals there
beat me up.

525
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,900
They picked on me. They pranked me.

526
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:08,533
- Son, what happened to you?
- Why do you look that way?

527
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:10,326
What did you do to my brother?

528
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,996
He got involved in a riot, ma'am.

529
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,123
And you didn't do anything?

530
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,001
Tell your brother
not to meddle in the riots.

531
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,132
But, there was nothing I could do.

532
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:28,011
There was nothing I could do because
I didn't stand a chance against them.

533
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:32,724
I wanted to give up,

534
00:31:33,808 --> 00:31:35,143
but you said no.

535
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,398
You promised me that you would get me out.

536
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,650
And I believed you.

537
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:47,572
Francis…

538
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:51,743
didn't I promise you that I will help you?

539
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:54,245
I will get you out of here.

540
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,835
Francis…

541
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,837
I endured all the hardships.

542
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:05,673
I endured hell.

543
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:15,308
Because I held on to your promise
that you would help me get out.

544
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,811
You kept your promise. You did get me out.

545
00:32:19,479 --> 00:32:21,731
But it turns out, you should do that.
You should.

546
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,442
- Francis…
- Because it's you…

547
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:26,778
It was you…

548
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,741
It was you who brought me to that hell.

549
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:36,996
Francis…

550
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:46,798
Francis…

551
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,102
George. George.

552
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:01,771
- Calm down.
- No, Dad.

553
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:04,148
I won't let this slide.

554
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:07,276
She needs to pay
for smearing Basil's name.

555
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,569
I know.

556
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,779
We are all mad.

557
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,157
But, you confronting her
won't do anything.

558
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,411
No, Dad. I need to do this.

559
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,329
- George.
- George, please.

560
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,957
Think about the baby. Please, George.

561
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,632
Okay. I will not confront her,

562
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,427
but I still need to let this out.

563
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:34,846
I want air.

564
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:39,183
I want air.
I need to breathe. I need to go out.

565
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:42,353
All right. Let's go.

566
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:43,896
I'll drive.

567
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,606
No, Dad.

568
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,400
You need to rest.

569
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:49,819
No. I won't risk it.

570
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:52,530
If you go out alone,

571
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:56,200
I will ask Cairo to go with you
so you'll be safe.

572
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,854
Yes, I went on my own.

573
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,482
I'll be careful. I promise.

574
00:34:28,441 --> 00:34:29,275
Yes.

575
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,278
You too. Take care.

576
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,150
Auntie Aurora and Auntie Hillary…

577
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,944
wrote to each other?

578
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:00,366
That's weird.

579
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,541
Cairo, give me the key and go back inside.

580
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:09,458
What?

581
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,961
I just want to be alone. Please.

582
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,046
- But, ma'am…
- Dad will not know.

583
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,340
I'll take care of you. I got you.

584
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:21,220
Thank you.

585
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:23,431
Francis. Francis, wait.

586
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,850
Let's talk. Francis.

587
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,812
Francis, let's talk. Francis.

588
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,148
Francis.

589
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,074
Sam.

590
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:07,516
<i>Hello, darling Auro.</i>

591
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,602
<i>I just want to say thank you.</i>

592
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,521
<i>You know, I wanted to kill myself</i>

593
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,982
<i>when I had a miscarriage</i>
<i>and lost mine and Alexander's baby.</i>

594
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:16,651
<i>But, you saved my life.</i>

595
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:21,364
<i>Thank you for letting me adopt</i>
<i>one of Rebecca's babies.</i>

596
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:23,074
<i>Hillary.</i>

597
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,957
A good friend of mine
persuaded me to adopt.

598
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,417
- So, yes.
- I didn't know that.

599
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:37,296
Well, maybe next time,
maybe you can bring them,

600
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,465
so I can meet them.

601
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,801
Of course, why not?

602
00:37:57,692 --> 00:37:59,318
You monster.

603
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,786
Auntie Aurora…

604
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:50,745
Why are you spreading rumors
that Basil blackmailed you?

605
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,915
Don't turn your back on me.

606
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,677
You monster.

607
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:10,348
You're a monster, Auntie Aurora.

608
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:16,354
Rebecca?

609
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,455
What are you doing here?

610
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,086
You gave away my babies?

611
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,845
Explain to me why you are destroying
my husband's reputation.

612
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,265
George, I'm not ruining
your husband's reputation.

613
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,976
Basil indeed blackmailed me

614
00:39:56,477 --> 00:39:58,187
to hide the video.

615
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,272
Why would he blackmail you?

616
00:40:00,356 --> 00:40:02,358
And what does he want you to do?

617
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,071
Trust me, George. You don't want to know.

618
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,741
You of all people, George.

619
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:13,911
Wait…

620
00:40:15,162 --> 00:40:16,664
maybe he did blackmail you.

621
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,584
Whatever it was, you didn't want to do it.

622
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,171
That's why you poisoned him,
so he wouldn't expose you.

623
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,139
Why?

624
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,892
Why did you give away my babies?

625
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,688
Why?

626
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,107
Why? Why?

627
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:46,735
How many times
do I have to tell you, Rebecca?

628
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:51,323
You didn't get pregnant
and you did not give birth.

629
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:54,952
No, that's not true.
I read Aunt Hillary's letter to you.

630
00:40:56,787 --> 00:40:58,539
- Rebecca.
- Give me your hand.

631
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,711
You can't deny it now.

632
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:05,087
Let me explain, Rebecca.

633
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:09,925
Give me back my children.

634
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:12,303
Why did you give away my children?

635
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:13,888
Why?

636
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,515
Rebecca, let me explain.

637
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,726
No. No.

638
00:41:18,809 --> 00:41:19,810
Give me back my children.

639
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,731
Rebecca…

640
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,279
Give me back my children.

641
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:31,906
Rebecca, no…

642
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,786
You monster!

643
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,331
- You poisoned my husband.
- Because…

644
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:42,416
Do you really want to know
what he wanted me to do?

645
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,002
<i>Your husband wanted me to kill you.</i>

646
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:46,212
<i>Amando, help.</i>

647
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,714
Where are my children?

648
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:51,050
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

649
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:52,760
Do you want to kill me?

650
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,094
You tried to kill me first.

651
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,304
<i>Think about your babies.</i>

652
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,056
- You're both pregnant.
- Are you pregnant?

653
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,974
Rebecca. Rebecca, no.

654
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,226
No, please.

655
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:03,229
Give me a reasonable explanation

656
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:07,149
as to why you gave away my children.

657
