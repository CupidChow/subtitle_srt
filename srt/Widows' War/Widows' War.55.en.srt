1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,015
George…

2
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:16,516
George, what happened?

3
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:18,476
It's Sam.

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:19,394
What did you do?

5
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,855
Did you make an attempt
on my daughter's life?

6
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:23,982
So, accept my letter of resignation

7
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:26,568
from serving you.

8
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,945
What did Ma'am Aurora do to you?

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,864
Don't meddle with me, Cairo.

10
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:35,035
Sir, whatever it is, just forget about it.

11
00:00:35,994 --> 00:00:37,954
Hey, why did you stop?

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,664
Go, continue.

13
00:00:42,667 --> 00:00:44,586
And who said we're fighting?

14
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,089
Oh, it's just one of our crazy banters.

15
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:52,135
But we are the best of friends.

16
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:54,721
- Right?
- Totally, Barry.

17
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:56,097
You attacked George.

18
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:57,807
You pushed her off the stairs.

19
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:59,601
She attacked me first.

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,895
Galvan, stop!

21
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:06,608
PREVIOUSLY

22
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,986
What the hell is happening here?

23
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,699
Ma'am, I'll leave you first.

24
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:16,117
Doc Anne is on her way.

25
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,368
Just wait for her.

26
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,120
- Okay, thank you.
- Okay.

27
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:28,505
George… How are you feeling?

28
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:35,470
Baby, just chill there.

29
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:39,516
George…

30
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:41,643
We can't ignore

31
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,269
what Sam did to you.

32
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:47,649
We need to sue her for physical injuries.

33
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,944
You're siding with that woman

34
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:53,488
after what she did to George?

35
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:55,073
Of course not.

36
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,575
But my point is, George said

37
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,077
that Sam pushed her.

38
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,371
But Sam here is saying

39
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,705
she pushed George accidentally.

40
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:05,917
Like what she claimed
when she pushed your son.

41
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,293
Yes, Mom.

42
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,838
Sam has committed
a lot of sins against us.

43
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:13,299
She needs to pay for all of it.

44
00:02:19,514 --> 00:02:20,557
George?

45
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,020
Call the doctor. Hurry. Hurry.

46
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,647
George, hang in there.

47
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,900
George…

48
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,278
Well, whether she pushed her
accidentally or not,

49
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,071
what's the issue, Galvan?

50
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,907
Did George die? No.

51
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,576
Did the baby die?

52
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:41,828
He didn't, right?

53
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:44,372
So, cut the drama.

54
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,499
If you want, you can sue Sam.

55
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,043
But don't you ever hurt Sam

56
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,421
because my grandchild might be affected.

57
00:02:56,968 --> 00:02:58,970
George… George…

58
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,975
George.

59
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,478
Ward!

60
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:09,689
Ward!

61
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,983
Get out of my way.

62
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,323
The moment something bad happens
to my grandchild,

63
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:19,699
you'll answer to me.

64
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,577
Uncle Galvan, I really didn't mean it.

65
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,495
She started it first. She pulled my hair.

66
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,539
That's why I accidentally pushed her.

67
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,875
Ward!

68
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,252
Ward.

69
00:03:31,336 --> 00:03:32,921
Ward, the doctor!

70
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,634
Doc, she started bleeding

71
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,969
and became unconscious.

72
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,559
No, Sam.

73
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,603
You did it intentionally.

74
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,773
You went to George's house

75
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,942
because you wanted

76
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,693
to accuse Ward again.

77
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:59,781
But you weren't content.
That's why you pushed her.

78
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,532
That's not true, Auntie Vivian.

79
00:04:01,616 --> 00:04:04,410
I went there to apologize to them.

80
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,204
Please don't meddle.

81
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:07,830
You're just messing things up.

82
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,790
And why not?

83
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:11,834
Because you're not a Palacios, Vivian.

84
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:14,128
So, shut up.

85
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,676
She's hemorrhaging.

86
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,264
Check the vitals.

87
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:25,765
Unresponsive.

88
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:29,185
- Stabilize it first. BP?
- 30/50, Doc.

89
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,938
Okay, start an IV line with normal saline.

90
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:33,398
- Yes, Doc.
- Wide open.

91
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:39,112
And you, Galvan.

92
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:41,614
Instead of fighting with Sam,

93
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:45,827
why don't we bring them
face-to-face to find out the truth?

94
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,791
Let's go to the hospital together.

95
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,298
Stop that already, Galvan.

96
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,799
Go change.

97
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,760
Let's meet here in an hour or so.

98
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,970
I will change too.

99
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:06,014
Go.

100
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,016
We need to keep her blood pressure up.

101
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,476
Doppler.

102
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,061
We need to check the fetal heartbeat.

103
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,689
- Doc.
- Okay.

104
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,742
It looks like there's no more heartbeat.

105
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,493
We need to take her to ultrasound.

106
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,536
- Come on.
- Yes, Doc.

107
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:35,460
Vivian, go!

108
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,755
Go.

109
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:48,681
Barry.

110
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:52,518
I don't know if I can still make it.

111
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:57,690
There's a new drama in my house.

112
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:03,571
Mom, stop crying.

113
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:06,365
Mom…

114
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,660
Mom…

115
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,662
Mom, George might wake up.

116
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,459
She can't see us crying.

117
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:23,257
I pity your sister.

118
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,552
She waited a long time to have a baby.

119
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:29,055
But now the baby's gone.

120
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,516
It's so painful.

121
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,729
We need to be strong

122
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,023
for George, right?

123
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,412
Come on. Come on, let's go.

124
00:06:54,789 --> 00:06:56,040
Ma'am Sam.

125
00:06:56,124 --> 00:06:57,458
Yes, Jericho.

126
00:06:57,542 --> 00:06:58,835
Auntie Aurora, Uncle Galvan.

127
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:00,336
What do you need?

128
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:03,548
George's baby is gone.

129
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,550
What?

130
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,717
What?

131
00:07:07,468 --> 00:07:08,761
Oh, my God.

132
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,367
Mom…

133
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,036
George…

134
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:38,082
How are you feeling?

135
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,462
Are you okay? Are you hungry?

136
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:44,005
Mom, how's my baby?

137
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,716
What happened to my baby?

138
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,271
No…

139
00:08:00,354 --> 00:08:03,024
What you're saying is not true.

140
00:08:03,107 --> 00:08:04,484
It can't be.

141
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,943
George's baby can't die.

142
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,612
It can't be.

143
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,947
No, that's not true.

144
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:12,825
No! My grandchild.

145
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,619
Sam!

146
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,247
What did you do?

147
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:19,373
This is your fault.

148
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,876
You animal. You killed my grandchild.

149
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,211
- Animal.
- Jericho.

150
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,004
- Vivian, take him back to his house.
- Animal.

151
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,006
- Galvan. Galvan.
- Animal.

152
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,258
- You'll pay for this!
- Take him back to his house.

153
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,932
Mom, please answer me.

154
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:38,893
What happened to my baby?

155
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,356
George…

156
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:48,069
Heaven gained another angel.

157
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:54,951
What…

158
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,412
Mom, no.

159
00:08:58,496 --> 00:09:00,873
It can't be. Mom…

160
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:03,376
George… George…

161
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,587
George…

162
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,174
Ward!

163
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,718
Ward!

164
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,845
What…

165
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:15,972
Mom…

166
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,434
The baby's gone?

167
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,270
My baby is gone?

168
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,605
You just came from the OR.

169
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,524
You had a D and C procedure.

170
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,030
What did you do?

171
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,409
- Animal.
- Go, Vivian. Take care of this.

172
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,745
I will make sure
that you will pay for this.

173
00:09:39,829 --> 00:09:41,455
You're an animal, Sam.

174
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,748
Why did you do this?

175
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:46,794
No, no, no, no…

176
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:47,878
No…

177
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,464
What?

178
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:54,343
Mom, my baby…

179
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,928
I want to see my baby.

180
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:57,430
George, you will see him,

181
00:09:57,513 --> 00:09:59,890
but not now. The doctor said

182
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,559
after you have recovered, okay?

183
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,603
No, Mom. I want to see him now.

184
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:06,022
No, George, you can't. You're still weak.

185
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,940
You can't manage.

186
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,400
Mom, I don't care.

187
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:11,485
George, George, no.

188
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,863
Don't… Don't…

189
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,115
Not now because you're still weak, George.

190
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,367
I will go with you. But not now, George.

191
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,744
- No, Mom, please…
- George…

192
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,162
Ward. Ward, call the doctor

193
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,122
and the nurse. Hurry.

194
00:10:23,205 --> 00:10:25,416
- I need my baby.
- Yes, George, I know.

195
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,543
I need to see my baby.

196
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,881
Mercy… Mercy…

197
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:34,425
Mercy, take Sam to your room,

198
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,385
and don't ever leave.

199
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:39,930
Galvan might attack Sam and kill her.

200
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:43,017
No. Not yet… It can't be.

201
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:47,063
Not until my grandchild is born…

202
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,732
God.

203
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:59,158
George, I'll go with you. I promise.

204
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,242
Please, please, Doc.

205
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:01,952
Let my daughter calm down.

206
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:03,663
Let go of me.

207
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:05,122
Let go.

208
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:07,166
I want to see my baby now.

209
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:10,711
- Mom, take me to my baby.
- Yes, I will take you there.

210
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:16,550
Take me to my baby now.

211
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,303
Nurse… Nurse…

212
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,765
Take me to my baby.

213
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:27,019
Please.

214
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,773
I need my baby.

215
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:34,485
I need to see my baby.

216
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,489
- Please…
- Diazepam given, Doc.

217
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:40,116
My baby…

218
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:45,913
I need my baby.

219
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:33,085
Was once not enough?

220
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,215
Do you have to repeat

221
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:40,801
the pain I've experienced before?

222
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,600
Lord, you gave me my miracle baby.

223
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,771
But you took it back.

224
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,610
Why, Lord?

225
00:12:58,777 --> 00:12:59,612
Why?

226
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:09,788
It's really my fault, Mother.

227
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,959
If I didn't provoke George…

228
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,004
If I didn't say anything bad to her then…

229
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:20,049
she wouldn't have gone amok.

230
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,843
She wouldn't have fallen from the stairs.

231
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:27,932
Sam, you didn't mean it.

232
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,100
- It was an accident. You didn't want what.
- Mother.

233
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:33,229
Her baby still died.

234
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,274
My God.

235
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:40,027
I don't know how I can forgive myself.

236
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,238
You're a fool, Sam.

237
00:13:42,821 --> 00:13:45,449
- Ruth.
- You're a murderer.

238
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,201
Ruth, please, don't.

239
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,160
She didn't mean it.

240
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,578
She didn't mean it,

241
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,913
but you killed my grandchild.

242
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,039
Have mercy, Ruth.

243
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,042
You killed my grandchild, Sam.

244
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:56,669
Ruth, please.

245
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,212
Have pity.

246
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,880
You weren't content.

247
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,908
Basil…

248
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,420
Let's stay in bed first.

249
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,256
But, you have a party later.

250
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:44,425
Your gifts are already coming.

251
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,804
There's only one gift I want.

252
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,055
What?

253
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,057
You.

254
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,853
George, wait.

255
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,730
Why do you seem happy

256
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:58,856
when you're hospitalized?

257
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,608
I'm pregnant.

258
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,818
I'll be an uncle, Mom.

259
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,028
Yes.

260
00:15:08,157 --> 00:15:10,075
Basil, I'm so sorry.

261
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:13,245
I failed to take care
of the most important gift

262
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,539
you left me.

263
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:23,881
Forgive me, Basil. Forgive me.

264
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:02,378
George…

265
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,301
George…

266
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,607
Have pity. She didn't mean it.

267
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:26,568
Why would I?
She killed my grandchild, Mercy.

268
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,570
Ruth, have pity.

269
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:31,323
You're a murderer, Sam.

270
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,660
You didn't pity my grandchild.

271
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:35,953
No.

272
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:43,252
You animal.

273
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,174
- Ma'am Ruth, stop it.
- You killed my grandchild!

274
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:52,094
- Ma'am Ruth, that's enough.
- You're not satisfied.

275
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:55,764
First, you had Ward beaten up by Cairo.

276
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:59,226
And now, you kill my grandchild.

277
00:16:59,309 --> 00:17:00,477
- That's enough, let's go.
- First, it was Ward

278
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,688
- and then my grandchild.
- That's enough.

279
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,149
Murderer!

280
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,080
Ward…

281
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,545
I will never have a baby.

282
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:32,259
This was my last chance to be a mommy.

283
00:17:34,595 --> 00:17:35,471
George…

284
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,307
You can still have a baby…

285
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:42,144
once you have a replacement for Basil.

286
00:17:46,273 --> 00:17:47,691
No, Ward.

287
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,736
No, it's no longer possible.

288
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,697
Because He just made me hope.

289
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,283
Right?

290
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,411
You just lead me on.

291
00:18:00,662 --> 00:18:02,164
You're ruthless.

292
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:08,545
Thank you.

293
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,091
You know, Auro. I'm honestly shocked

294
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,967
that you still attended the event.

295
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:18,388
Considering that George's baby died.

296
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:22,559
The baby wouldn't come back to life

297
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:25,813
if I stayed here,
or if I went to the hospital.

298
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,439
And one more thing, Barry,

299
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,984
I want Galvan to calm down and grieve.

300
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:33,987
Well, you have a point.

301
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,573
But still, my condolences.

302
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:37,741
Thank you.

303
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:38,784
That's still your grandchild.

304
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:43,372
Or should I say congratulations?

305
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:49,128
Your grandchild is
the only remaining future Palacios.

306
00:18:49,211 --> 00:18:50,838
I'm sure you're super thrilled.

307
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,049
I think this calls for a celebration.
What do you think?

308
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,843
Oh, Barry.

309
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:58,846
You're so good at twisting things.

310
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,392
Didn't you just say

311
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:05,435
that that's still my grandchild?

312
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:07,604
He's the baby of my nephew, Basil.

313
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,732
So, why would I celebrate
the baby's death?

314
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,860
- Hurry, the car.
- Samantha.

315
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,989
Get the car ready.

316
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,282
Where the hell are you going?

317
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:19,408
To the hospital.

318
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,909
What?

319
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:24,246
Didn't I tell you to just stay home?

320
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,249
I don't remember agreeing to that.

321
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,960
Watch your mouth, young lady.

322
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:31,044
You're rude.

323
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,674
So…

324
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,595
This is the infamous
daughter-in-law from hell

325
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:41,972
that you've been talking about, Auro.

326
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,225
She fits the description, right?

327
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,394
And she's got all the traits.

328
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,606
Rude, a war freak,

329
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:54,818
and let's not forget her gutter manners.

330
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:59,114
And now, baby killer.

331
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,700
Wow, what a character.

332
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:03,202
Oh, no.

333
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:06,538
It looks like Ms. Sam has a new enemy.

334
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:08,123
Who is that?

335
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,960
That's Barbara Sagrado-Dee.

336
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,545
She's cruel.

337
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,130
And a widow too.

338
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,549
Widows' war is the fad here.

339
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:20,928
What are you doing?

340
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,390
Just with her looks,

341
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,936
you can smell the stench
of canal character.

342
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:30,312
Right?

343
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:34,691
George…

344
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,570
Don't blame God.

345
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:43,116
You should blame the person who did this.

346
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:45,535
She should pay for this.

347
00:20:48,956 --> 00:20:50,624
And that's Sam.

348
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,001
Hush now.

349
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:56,838
Let go of me.

350
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,302
George…

351
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,480
It looks like
you'll just gossip about me here, right?

352
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,983
I don't think my presence is needed here.

353
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:18,485
Samantha. Samantha.

354
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:20,737
Oh, God.

355
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,867
You know, she's really like Jackie.

356
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,995
Why do these rich men

357
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:31,123
fall for this kind of woman?

358
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,917
I don't understand.

359
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:42,175
Are you gossiping about our bosses?

360
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:43,677
No, sir.

361
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,595
We're just waiting for orders.

362
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:47,639
You better make sure.

363
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:49,850
I'm reducing staff.

364
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,352
I might fire you two first.

365
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,528
It's your fault.

366
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:05,157
If we can't gossip about our bosses,

367
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,742
we can gossip about helpers.

368
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,536
Read this.

369
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:12,873
It's Sir Amando's love letter
to Ma'am Aurora.

370
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,006
Auro…

371
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,884
now I understand why you hate

372
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:24,968
your daughter-in-law so much.

373
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,971
She has no manners.

374
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:31,224
But you know, you've found your match.

375
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,684
You're a match.

376
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:34,603
The fight is very even.

377
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,815
Are you saying
that I don't have manners either?

378
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,401
No, silly.

379
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,653
But seriously, I think

380
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:45,655
you've found your match.

381
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:51,036
The woman who will cause
the downfall of Aurora Palacios.

382
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:54,331
Oh my gosh, I can't wait to see it happen.

383
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:56,083
I'm so excited.

384
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,335
You are so delusional, Barry.

385
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,504
That day will never come.

386
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,882
No one can bring down

387
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,551
the one and only Aurora Palacios.

388
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,138
Well, let's see about that.

389
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:37,499
You attacked Sam, Mom?

390
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,459
Let's talk about that later.

391
00:23:44,506 --> 00:23:45,590
George…

392
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,760
Do you want to eat now?

393
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,723
Mom, I want to be alone first.

394
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,600
No, that's not possible.

395
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,601
At a time like this,

396
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,937
you need Mom to take care of you

397
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,939
and make you stronger and happy.

398
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,774
Mom, what's with you?

399
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:06,069
Is my request difficult to understand?

400
00:24:07,028 --> 00:24:09,948
Ward, can you and Mom go out, please?

401
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,449
I just want to be alone.

402
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,785
Please, Mom.

403
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,495
Okay, George.

404
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:36,766
Rico, what's that?

405
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:39,436
It's Sir Amando's letter
to Madam that he threw away.

406
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,605
Look at this. Cairo picked it up.

407
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:45,692
Sir Amando is something else.

408
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:47,861
He has fallen madly in love.

409
00:24:47,944 --> 00:24:50,780
He will do everything in the name of love.

410
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,997
Mom…

411
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,665
What's with you? Why are you so annoying?

412
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,210
Didn't I tell you…

413
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,131
What are you doing here, you devil?

414
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,928
George…

415
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,516
I came here to tell you that…

416
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,811
what happened is painful for me too.

417
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:26,733
And I am here to comfort you, George.

418
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,447
And I will do everything…

419
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,366
to somehow lessen the pain

420
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,868
you're feeling.

421
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,081
You will do anything?

422
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:43,708
Anything.

423
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:47,587
I followed all your orders.

424
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,715
Even if I didn't want to,
even if it was against my will,

425
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,217
even if it's no longer right,

426
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,260
I still did it.

427
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,303
You are right.

428
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:58,598
Because of love,
a person can do everything.

429
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:01,184
Even if he ends up killing.

430
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:03,353
Can I have this?

431
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,938
What will you do with that?

432
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,357
Will you copy it
for the woman you're courting?

433
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,192
There's no originality.

434
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,111
Go ahead, you can have it.

435
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:25,500
George…

436
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,670
George… George…

437
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:34,134
What now? What?

438
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,137
Can you still take it?
Do you still want some more?

439
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,179
Should I go on?

440
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,936
Sam, why are you not answering?

441
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:50,692
Jericho? Are you with Sam?

442
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,736
Is that so?

443
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,323
All right. Is that so? Okay.

444
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,616
Excuse me.

445
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,745
I just want to ask.

446
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:04,456
There are people here
who look like helpers,

447
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:07,208
but they're not. Just like Vivian.

448
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,543
So, I just want to ask,

449
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,504
are you a helper here?

450
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:12,714
Can you please throw this?

451
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:14,632
I am not a helper here.

452
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,301
I am Aurora's in-law,

453
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,636
but okay, I'll throw this for you.

454
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,849
So, you're Mercy.

455
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:27,395
You're the mother
of that shameless baby killer,

456
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,813
Samantha.

457
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,565
What did you say?

458
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,196
If it will make you feel better.

459
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:40,367
Is that so?

460
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:42,285
Then…

461
00:27:43,870 --> 00:27:45,163
George?

462
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:47,415
George… George…

463
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,463
It would greatly reduce the pain I feel

464
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,299
if you also lost your baby, just like me.

465
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,888
What did you say about my daughter?

466
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:03,390
I'm sorry.

467
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,682
Are you deaf?

468
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:07,811
Is there something wrong
with your hearing?

469
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:09,646
I said--

470
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,814
I'm not deaf

471
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:13,441
and my daughter is not a baby killer.

472
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:15,485
Oh, my gosh.

473
00:28:15,568 --> 00:28:18,029
You are such a war freak.

474
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,406
You would slap me?

475
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:21,282
You know, that is so basic.

476
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,284
Oh yes, Barry.

477
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:27,372
She is a major war freak.

478
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:29,124
But what do you expect

479
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:32,877
from a cockroach raised in the slums?

480
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,673
You're so thick-faced to come here

481
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,426
after what happened.

482
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,970
George, don't blame me for what happened.

483
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,388
It was an accident.

484
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,598
Accident?

485
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,559
You pushed me. You killed my baby.

486
00:28:47,642 --> 00:28:48,893
And now you're saying it's an accident?

487
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,396
We both know what happened, George.

488
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,439
No.

489
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,066
George, I went there to ask
for your forgiveness.

490
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,901
I was there to say sorry to you.

491
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,028
I already said no,

492
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:00,447
but you still nagged me.

493
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,407
Because I don't want to give up on you.

494
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,408
I don't want to give up

495
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,702
on our friendship, George.

496
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,953
But, I already did.

497
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:10,707
I gave up on you, Samantha.

498
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,502
I gave up on our friendship.

499
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,924
No wonder Samantha behaves like that.

500
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:22,761
There is a genetic predisposition.

501
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:24,387
Don't insult my daughter.

502
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:25,889
You're a bunch of animals.

503
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:29,225
I didn't know you had a twin

504
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,352
as evil as you.

505
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:34,939
You're both the same.

506
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,816
You wear stylish clothes,

507
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:39,652
flawless and beautiful.

508
00:29:40,236 --> 00:29:44,324
But your attitude

509
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,493
is as filthy as a sewer.

510
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:47,702
How dare you.

511
00:29:59,464 --> 00:30:01,341
But you're so insistent.

512
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,273
George. George.

513
00:30:18,566 --> 00:30:19,484
Stop it.

514
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,568
Let go of me.

515
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,320
Stop it.

516
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:24,614
Stop it. George.

517
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:41,798
It's you who has a sewer-like
attitude, not me.

518
00:30:44,092 --> 00:30:45,343
Now I understand

519
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:48,555
why Orly chose you.

520
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,474
I know, right?

521
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,937
No decent man could endure…

522
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,065
this kind of woman.

523
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:01,901
Don't involve my husband here.

524
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,779
My husband that you killed, Aurora.

525
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:10,410
You will kill my baby?

526
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,537
Yes.

527
00:31:13,413 --> 00:31:17,292
Because that's the payment
for the death of my baby.

528
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:21,004
Blood for blood.
Flesh for flesh. A child for a child.

529
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:24,591
George, I know
what you're feeling right now is painful,

530
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,051
but don't involve my baby.

531
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,512
I can't lose my baby. No.

532
00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:31,347
Why not?

533
00:31:32,432 --> 00:31:34,976
Are you the only one
who can continue being a mother?

534
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,978
And I can't?

535
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:40,398
- You're a fool.
- Oh, my gosh.

536
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,233
You're a bunch of fools.

537
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:43,276
- Stop it.
- You fool.

538
00:31:43,359 --> 00:31:44,235
I said stop it.

539
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:46,446
Ouch.

540
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,909
The next time you go near Ma'am Aurora,

541
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,869
I will forget that you're a woman.

542
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,707
Thank you, Amando.

543
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,668
Let's go, Barry.

544
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,086
It's your fault.

545
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:05,256
You loiter around my mansion.

546
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:07,258
It's because your mansion is so huge.

547
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:09,302
I don't know where to go.

548
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:12,305
Now you've met the other crazy woman.

549
00:32:12,388 --> 00:32:16,434
Sam this is the second baby
that I've lost.

550
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:20,939
This was my second chance to be a mother,

551
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:23,107
my last chance.

552
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:55,890
What do you mean?

553
00:32:58,226 --> 00:33:00,269
Have you had a miscarriage before?

554
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,738
- Cheers, my dear Barry.
- Cheers.

555
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:12,699
My sexy friend.

556
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:20,373
- I love it.
- Yeah.

557
00:33:20,456 --> 00:33:22,709
Did you see Larry earlier?

558
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,211
Oh, my gosh. Did you see her outfit?

559
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:27,046
I know, right?

560
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,674
It's so… My gosh.

561
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,906
Do you know what it feels like

562
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,160
to be a mother of a dead baby?

563
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,247
You aren't able to see your baby,

564
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,457
touch…

565
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,876
or embrace it?

566
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:07,086
Do you know how that feels, Sam?

567
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,004
Do you know?

568
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,923
No.

569
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,550
Exactly.

570
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,262
Because you've never had a miscarriage.

571
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,891
And that's why I want you feel it.

572
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:22,977
George. George.

573
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,940
George. George.

574
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,612
George.

575
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,197
- George. George.
- George.

576
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,573
- George, that's enough.
- Ward.

577
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:37,617
George. George.

578
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,993
George.

579
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,912
George, stop it.

580
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,538
George. Mom.

581
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45,917
Stop it.

582
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,669
Why are you stopping your sister?

583
00:34:49,378 --> 00:34:51,589
We should let the baby killer pay.

584
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,550
And then what, Mom?

585
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,970
We will prove Sam's accusations about us?

586
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,474
We are not killers, Mom.

587
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:04,644
You.

588
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:08,606
You and your family are the killers.

589
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:13,945
So, just leave.

590
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,948
I'm begging you, Sam. Leave.

591
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,140
Call the nurse.

592
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,611
Sam, good thing you called.
I'm worried for you.

593
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:57,572
Why are you crying?

594
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,990
What?

595
00:35:59,073 --> 00:36:00,741
Are you near already?

596
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,618
Okay, I'll wait for you.

597
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,666
Amando…

598
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:12,253
I'm used to you always defending Aurora.

599
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,255
But I didn't know that…

600
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,092
you're capable of hurting a woman.

601
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:30,730
George…

602
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:47,830
George, I'm so sorry for your loss.

603
00:36:52,877 --> 00:36:54,837
Thank you, Sofia.

604
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:59,217
Mercy, I don't have time to talk to you.

605
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,052
If you want me to apologize

606
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:02,637
for what I did earlier,

607
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,846
don't expect it.

608
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,103
What else can you do
for your monstrous boss?

609
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:12,104
What else?

610
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,523
If you could hurt a woman,

611
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:18,361
could you also kill for her?

612
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,837
George…

613
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,173
Dad…

614
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:50,351
How are you feeling, my child?

615
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,563
Dad, I'm so sorry.

616
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,149
Dad, I'm so sorry.

617
00:37:57,233 --> 00:38:00,194
I failed to save your grandchild.

618
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,698
I'm so sorry.

619
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,967
What do you mean?

620
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:27,722
You heard what I said,
but I will say it again.

621
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,725
If you could hurt a woman,

622
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,436
could you also kill for her?

623
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:37,023
- I am not a killer.
- Mr. Namas!

624
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,110
If you continue,

625
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,321
we will sue you for physical assault.

626
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,867
Sergeant…

627
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,953
Why are you here?

628
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:53,956
Is there a development in Francis' case?

629
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,625
None yet, Ms. Mercy.

630
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:59,587
But we are here to talk to Mr. Namas.

631
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:24,945
I know how much
you wanted to have a grandson.

632
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:30,659
I swear, I really took
good care of that baby.

633
00:39:31,327 --> 00:39:34,330
Yes, I know you did, George.
I know you did.

634
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,211
But it's Sam…

635
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,465
She killed my baby.

636
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:47,802
She killed your grandchild.

637
00:39:57,228 --> 00:39:59,313
Sam, why?

638
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,940
What happened?

639
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,818
Why are you crying?

640
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,320
What happened?

641
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,072
Why?

642
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,658
That's enough, George.

643
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,369
Something might happen to you.

644
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,038
Stop it.

645
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:19,417
That's enough.

646
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,219
What's this, Sergeant Royales?

647
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,179
Didn't you already ask all the staff here

648
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,931
about Francis' case?

649
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,850
Yes.

650
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:38,477
And you told me that you were just here.

651
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,229
Yes.

652
00:40:41,021 --> 00:40:42,982
And you were with Mrs. Palacios.

653
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:44,150
Yes.

654
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,736
We talked to all the staff again.

655
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:52,408
Rico said there was an hour or two

656
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,035
when she was with Mrs. Palacios.

657
00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:00,374
Did I say
I was with Ma'am Aurora the whole night?

658
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,168
No, right?

659
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,169
Wait.

660
00:41:03,752 --> 00:41:05,337
Why are you interviewing me again?

661
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,591
Because of this, Mr. Namas.

662
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,111
We weren't able to give him a name.

663
00:41:29,195 --> 00:41:30,529
He has a name.

664
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:32,781
- It's Basilio Basil.
- My grandson.

665
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,034
Are you suspecting
that I was the one who ran Francis over?

666
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,243
You're being defensive.

667
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:37,995
I followed all your orders.
Even if I didn't want to.

668
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:40,039
Even if it's no longer right,
I still did it.

669
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:42,166
You're now the new person of interest

670
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,210
for running over Francis.

671
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:47,087
You're the only one
who should be the lone heir.

672
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:50,007
Whatever or whoever will stand in the way

673
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,091
must be gotten rid of.

674
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:53,135
George, I will do everything.
Just forgive me.

675
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,304
Only if you give me your baby.

676
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:56,931
No one can get my grandchild.

677
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:58,057
- Except you.
- Do you think

678
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,141
she can replace the baby

679
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,851
- that you lost?
- Yes.

680
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:03,562
The war is now starting

681
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:06,357
and it's all because of you.

682
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,691
Mom!
