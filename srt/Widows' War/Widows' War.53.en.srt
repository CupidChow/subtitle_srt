1
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:16,516
Ms. George was not telling the truth.

2
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,726
PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:17,809 --> 00:00:19,352
Ward knows how to drive.

4
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:20,478
What?

5
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,815
Yes, I taught him how to drive.

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:25,316
<i>Tell me Aurora,</i>

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,820
did you put that mask
on that boy's possession

8
00:00:29,988 --> 00:00:32,240
so you won't be the suspect anymore?

9
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,160
Where were you on the night
Mr. Castillo was run over?

10
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:36,327
I was…

11
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,705
in the village clubhouse.

12
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,790
Do you have a witness or evidence

13
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:41,916
that you were there at that time?

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,334
I do.

15
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,255
It's Mr. Arnel. He was the guard on duty
in the clubhouse that night.

16
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:51,593
Ward didn't drop by
the clubhouse that day.

17
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:55,430
I think the last time
he was here was last week.

18
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:57,432
<i>Vivian sent a text.</i>

19
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:00,268
To me too.

20
00:01:00,894 --> 00:01:02,270
<i>Good thing you called me right away.</i>

21
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:04,814
I was able to find a way

22
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:09,277
and destroyed the CCTV camera
in the lobby,

23
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:12,489
<i>It wasn't Ward who killed Francis.</i>

24
00:01:12,572 --> 00:01:14,866
It was Auntie Mercy
who was supposed to be run over.

25
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,535
Francis only saved her, right?

26
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:20,622
So what's Ward's motive
to do that to Auntie Mercy?

27
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:25,919
Answer me, Sam.

28
00:01:26,002 --> 00:01:27,337
What is Ward's motive

29
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,672
- to run Auntie Mercy over?
- I don't know!

30
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:33,092
I don't know.
All I know is that he killed my brother.

31
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:34,552
He killed my brother.

32
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,014
So what now, George?
Just because we're friends now

33
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:39,891
I will forget all the evidence

34
00:01:39,974 --> 00:01:42,811
that pinpoints your brother?
Is that what you want, George?

35
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:46,231
It's not Ward who did that to Francis.

36
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:49,234
- Someone framed him.
- That's so convenient, George.

37
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:50,860
It's so convenient.

38
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:53,363
That damn reason he was framed.

39
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:54,989
Stop it. That's enough.

40
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,366
Ms. Samantha, I'm begging you.

41
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:58,368
Let me handle this.

42
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,452
I'll just give you an update.

43
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,162
Please, Ms. Samantha.

44
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:02,747
Come on, Ms. Mercy.

45
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,082
Come on.

46
00:02:04,165 --> 00:02:05,291
I'll take care of it.

47
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,193
I will sue Ward for homicide.

48
00:02:32,277 --> 00:02:34,195
No, murder.

49
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,823
Ms. Samantha, you cannot sue
that carelessly.

50
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:39,617
Sergeant Tupaz, didn't you find
any other evidence

51
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:40,952
aside from what you have right now?

52
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,120
None yet.

53
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:44,581
The car that Edward used that night,

54
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,749
didn't match the length of the tire marks

55
00:02:46,833 --> 00:02:50,753
as the car used by the person
who ran over your brother.

56
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,088
There's a big difference.

57
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,216
Maybe he borrowed a car from someone else,

58
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,634
or rented one.

59
00:02:57,218 --> 00:02:59,012
We're still checking that, but for now,

60
00:02:59,095 --> 00:03:01,639
we don't have enough evidence
to sue Edward.

61
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:10,148
We shouldn't have comforted that woman.

62
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,026
It was wrong that we showed them kindness.

63
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:15,987
I'm so disappointed with Sam, Mom.

64
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:18,740
She easily believed that Ward was guilty.

65
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,701
Excuse me George,

66
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:27,498
but can you blame the person
when she lost a brother?

67
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,417
If that happened to you,

68
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,252
wouldn't you have the same reaction?

69
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,923
And then the evidence was found
with your brother.

70
00:03:35,006 --> 00:03:37,300
If you don't want Ward to go to jail,

71
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,177
then prove that he is innocent.

72
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:44,766
Find evidence that would
prove his innocence.

73
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:48,895
Then slap it in the face
of that crybaby Sam.

74
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:50,480
Right?

75
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,608
Ward, let's go
to the guard in the clubhouse.

76
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:56,611
Let's talk to him.
Let's ask him why he lied.

77
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,196
Maybe he has forgotten
that you talked to each other,

78
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:01,241
or maybe he's thinking about
another person.

79
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:04,118
It's important that you face each other.

80
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,246
Ruth,

81
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,583
didn't Sergeant Tupaz bring
Ward's picture?

82
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:15,129
I don't think that guard will deny
that he spoke to your son that night.

83
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:17,882
That's right. And is it true that…

84
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:23,304
you will just talk to the guard
in the clubhouse?

85
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:27,767
Or maybe you will talk
to the guard to lie for Edward?

86
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,102
What are you trying to say, Vivian?

87
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:31,479
That we're going to harass the guard?

88
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:34,649
I don't know about you.

89
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:37,193
It's you who knows your plans.

90
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,444
And…

91
00:04:38,528 --> 00:04:43,199
maybe Ward wasn't in
the clubhouse that night.

92
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,660
Excuse me, Auntie Vivian.

93
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,414
I was in the clubhouse that night.

94
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:51,749
Are you sure?

95
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,793
Are you really, really sure?

96
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,755
Or maybe you went to hear mass
at Santo Niño Parish?

97
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:12,228
How about the mask?
The mask that was found with him,

98
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,813
just like the mask of the Palacios Killer?

99
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,024
Isn't that enough evidence?

100
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:19,485
Forensics are checking
if they can find specs.

101
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,237
In case there is,

102
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,031
they will compare it to Ward's DNA.

103
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,241
What if the forensic's results
turn out as postive?

104
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:27,243
That's the only time
the case will move forward.

105
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:30,580
How about him lying
that he went to the clubhouse?

106
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,081
Doesn't that have bearings?

107
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,000
There is…

108
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,419
but since we don't have any CCTV footage,

109
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,880
we can't confirm
if the guard is telling the truth

110
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,298
that he didn't see Ward.

111
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,925
Aside from that, we don't have evidence

112
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:46,512
of where Edward was
the night your brother was run over.

113
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,806
We are still checking
if there's a sighting

114
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:50,600
of him near the church.

115
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:52,226
- But…
- But what?

116
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,479
But if he can prove that
he was in a different place

117
00:05:54,562 --> 00:05:58,441
at the exact time of the crime
as a solid alibi,

118
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:01,319
then it would prove that
someone framed him.

119
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:04,363
It wasn't Ward who killed your brother.

120
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,618
Excuse me, Vivian, can you repeat that?

121
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,787
Do I have to repeat it over and over?

122
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,291
I said, too bad.

123
00:06:15,374 --> 00:06:17,877
The security guard would have
been Ward's perfect alibi

124
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,881
that he really wasn't there
at the scene of the crime.

125
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,425
No, no, no…

126
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:27,053
you mentioned Santo Niño Parish.

127
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:31,057
That was the church
where Francis was run over.

128
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,061
So what? Santo Niño Parish,
what's with it?

129
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,105
Even if I say it over and over,
Santo Niño Parish.

130
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:39,732
Why? I'm just asking, George.

131
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,026
Mommy, no.

132
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,152
You were not asking.

133
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:46,864
You were insinuating
that Ward was there in the church.

134
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,700
Okay, fine. Fine, fine, fine. Okay, okay.

135
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:52,829
So he was in the clubhouse
if he was there.

136
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,081
But he said he wasn't there.

137
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:58,417
But okay, let's just say
Ward was in the clubhouse.

138
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,378
But was he there the whole night?

139
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:01,504
That's the question.

140
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:06,926
Was he there at the exact time
that Francis was run over?

141
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:10,680
Ward,

142
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,725
I hate to admit it,
but Vivian has a point.

143
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,770
Were you at the clubhouse the whole night?

144
00:07:26,404 --> 00:07:27,488
Sam, my child?

145
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:30,491
I won't let Francis
face the same fate as Dad.

146
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,702
That we failed to give him justice.

147
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,539
Is that what's making you sad
or is there a different reason?

148
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,833
Of course, I'm sad about what happened

149
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,793
to my friendship with George.

150
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,212
Sam?

151
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,554
George?

152
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,818
I waited for a long time for us to be okay

153
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:09,238
and then in a flash, this happened.

154
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:12,074
But there's nothing I can do.

155
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:17,330
I won't allow Francis not to get justice

156
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,707
just because of my friendship with George.

157
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,138
Why are you both looking at each other?

158
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,890
Are you hiding something?

159
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:38,309
Nothing, George.

160
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:39,769
Ward, it feels like
you're hiding something.

161
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:43,064
Go ahead and say it so we can help you.

162
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,067
Ward, we have to tell them.

163
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,611
Sofia, what are you talking about?

164
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,363
Do you know something about this?

165
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,994
Don't tell me
you've been conniving with Ward.

166
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:58,037
Mommy, no.

167
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:00,414
So, what?

168
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,585
So what? Sofia? Ward?

169
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:06,045
Say it.

170
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,258
Ward, if this will save you
from the possible case

171
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:11,425
that they will file against you,

172
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:14,262
then just go ahead and say it.

173
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:17,056
Ward,

174
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,810
what now? Why don't you want to talk?

175
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,854
Where did you go after the clubhouse?

176
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:26,023
Hey, you better talk,

177
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,400
or else my daughter
might get involved with you.

178
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,859
Mommy, just shut up.

179
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,320
What?

180
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,156
Ward, say it. What's that?

181
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,576
Ward, just tell us the truth!

182
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,245
Okay, okay.

183
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,543
I needed a companion that night.

184
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,922
That's why after I left the clubhouse

185
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,383
I called Sofia.

186
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,012
And…

187
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:01,142
- we went to a motel.
- What!

188
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:16,449
Did they do the job well, Amando?

189
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:17,950
Yes, madam.

190
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,208
- Arnel?
- Boss.

191
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,296
Did you do what I asked you to do?

192
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:34,175
Yes, Boss. Good thing
you called me right away.

193
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,344
I was able to find a way

194
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:40,014
to destroy the CCTV camera in the lobby,

195
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,224
including the footage
in the storage device.

196
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,684
I erased it.

197
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,104
That's good to hear.

198
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,066
Thank you, Boss.

199
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,696
Boss, I'm just curious
about what you asked me to do.

200
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,159
Get down.

201
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:03,954
Thanks for this, Boss.

202
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,837
Anymore updates?

203
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,591
George and Sam are fighting.

204
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,635
Ward is getting pinned down
for what happened to Francis.

205
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:19,178
Oh, good.

206
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:22,848
At least the suspicion about me
will be completely gone,

207
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,309
regarding Francis's death.

208
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,145
So Samantha will stop bothering me.

209
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,732
We're still not sure about that, madam.

210
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:39,323
Did you bring my daughter to the motel?

211
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:42,618
You prick!

212
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:50,543
- You…
- Wait.

213
00:11:50,626 --> 00:11:52,169
Dad, just wait. Stop.

214
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:55,214
Wait. Nothing happened
between me and Ward, okay?

215
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,595
It's true.

216
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,389
Ward and I,

217
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,684
we're attracted to each other.

218
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,939
But I changed my mind.
I realized I was too young.

219
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,568
And Ward, he respected my decision.

220
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:19,864
And we just stayed there.
I comforted him. That's all.

221
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:26,328
What do you mean, Amando?

222
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,123
Sam will not stop bothering you, madam

223
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:32,209
because her anger towards
you is deep-rooted.

224
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,629
What is it again?

225
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:42,845
Her insistent claim
that I killed her father?

226
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:46,015
Yes, madam. And you have
a relationship with Orly.

227
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,813
Know your place in this house, Amando.

228
00:12:52,897 --> 00:12:54,356
You're only my helper.

229
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:59,820
You have no right
to comment on my personal affairs.

230
00:12:59,904 --> 00:13:00,738
Now get out.

231
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,618
I said get out!

232
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:19,798
What?

233
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:24,845
Damn you, Ward!

234
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,640
You disrespected my daughter!

235
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,184
- No, he did not.
- Yes, he did.

236
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,894
He disrespected you.

237
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,063
He brought you to a motel.

238
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,315
And you went with him too.

239
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,234
I just wanted to comfort him, Dad.

240
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,486
- He was grieving, that's all.
- Shut up!

241
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:44,865
Comfort? Comfort, really?

242
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,158
Just say he's a maniac.

243
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:52,540
Why, you can comfort Ward here
in the house or the garden.

244
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,084
Coffee shop or somewhere else.

245
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,669
But to a motel?

246
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:59,004
Sofia, you let him bring you to a motel?

247
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:01,632
Not even to a hotel?

248
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,635
- How dare you.
- Hey. Hey, shut up!

249
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,305
You're a maniac! Maniac!

250
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:13,394
George, take your brother away from me.

251
00:14:13,477 --> 00:14:15,271
I might kill him.

252
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,735
Come here. You're also a flirt.

253
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:23,112
Maniac!

254
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,155
- Let's go.
- And you're also a flirt.

255
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:29,076
Hey Ward. You're a maniac.
Maniac! We're not done yet.

256
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,411
Maniac!

257
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,037
Maniac!

258
00:14:44,258 --> 00:14:46,135
I'm sorry, Barry.

259
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,680
Amando made me angry.

260
00:14:49,763 --> 00:14:53,517
<i>Do you have an LQ with your butler?</i>

261
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,436
What LQ?

262
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,066
Just one of those moments
with my meddlesome factotum.

263
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:07,615
The curse of having
a long-time family help just like Amando.

264
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,825
Just because we grew up together,

265
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:14,455
he thinks he can give opinions
about my life.

266
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:16,540
God.

267
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:19,501
<i>But servants like that are loyal.</i>

268
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,836
<i>I wouldn't be surprised</i>

269
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,380
<i>if you already ordered him</i>
<i>to kill someone.</i>

270
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,260
What kind of assumption is that, Barbara?

271
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:31,472
<i>I'm sorry. But anyway,</i>
<i>I have something to tell you.</i>

272
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,601
What's that?

273
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,854
Madam Sam, where are we going?

274
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,773
We're going to Santo Niño Parish.

275
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,149
We'll ask the people from the church,

276
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,359
or anyone within the vicinity,

277
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:45,110
if they may have seen Ward that night.

278
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,820
That night when Francis got run over.

279
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,039
You won't find anyone

280
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,249
or anything that will point to Ward there.

281
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,212
Sofia and Ward went to the motel

282
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,547
during the time Francis was run over.

283
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,177
That's the evidence.

284
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,639
They have a record there
because the staff of the motel

285
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,558
didn't believe that they were
already 18 years old.

286
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,852
That's why they presented their IDs.

287
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:26,568
Ward is innocent, Samantha.
My brother is innocent.

288
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,949
Wait a second, Barry.

289
00:16:34,034 --> 00:16:35,953
I'm getting drunk already.

290
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,204
You keep gossiping,

291
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:41,375
but you still haven't told me
why you called.

292
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:47,589
<i>Oh yeah, the AS3 Foundation</i>
<i>is hosting a charity auction.</i>

293
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:52,511
Oh, can I put my daughter-in-law
up for auction?

294
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:59,768
Oh but let's make it clear,
the baby is not included.

295
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:05,274
Once Samantha has given birth,
they will return the baby to me.

296
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,361
<i>You're really pissed</i>
<i>with your daughter-in-law.</i>

297
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:13,407
<i>I'm curious though</i>… <i>Did you know</i>

298
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,326
<i>that Samantha is the daughter</i>
<i>of Orly, your lover?</i>

299
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,495
Excuse me?

300
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:22,291
Orly, my lover?

301
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,254
<i>Sorry, you're Orly's mistress.</i>

302
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,881
Barbara!

303
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,599
It's easy to fabricate
documents like this.

304
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:41,310
Why, was there CCTV footage

305
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,353
of Sofia and Ward together?

306
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,440
They went to a cheap motel.

307
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,776
The CCTV Cameras were limited

308
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:50,611
and often malfunctioned.

309
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:51,862
Oh, come on.

310
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:56,825
George, you don't have to explain.
There's no CCTV footage. No video.

311
00:17:57,659 --> 00:18:00,204
Madam Sam, Madam George, what's with you?

312
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,872
Talk calmly.

313
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,418
I'm already showing you valid proof
of my brother's innocence.

314
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,878
Why do you still not want to believe?

315
00:18:07,961 --> 00:18:10,172
Because I know
that you're just covering for him.

316
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:11,840
You're protecting him.

317
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:16,929
Like I'm going to do everything
just to get justice for Francis.

318
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,848
Do you really see me that way, Sam?

319
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,727
Yes, I will protect Ward,
but I won't cover up for him

320
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:28,816
- if he has sinned.
- Of course, you would, George.

321
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,150
I'm also a big sister.

322
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:33,403
I know you will do everything
for your brother.

323
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:38,408
Are you saying that
in case Francis sinned?

324
00:18:38,492 --> 00:18:41,245
You will lie to protect him?

325
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,748
Yes, George and I can admit it.

326
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,585
How about you? Can you admit that

327
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,879
that's what you're doing for Ward?

328
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,388
You know what,
don't compare me to you, Samantha.

329
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:04,977
I won't tolerate Ward
if he does something wrong.

330
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,064
Come on George. I know you.

331
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,609
I know you will do everything
for your family.

332
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,070
I know you can kill for your family.

333
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,865
That's why we're friends, right?

334
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,241
Because we're the same.

335
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:23,412
You know what? This is pointless.
It's pointless!

336
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,666
No matter what I say or do,
you will not believe me!

337
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,962
It's official.
You just lost a friend. Again!

338
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,047
We're done.

339
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:39,720
I don't regret that
I comforted you when Francis died.

340
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,055
Because you also comforted Mom and Ward

341
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:43,765
when I was kidnapped.

342
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,643
But you know what I regret?

343
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:48,395
You know what breaks me?

344
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:52,649
I was hoping we could be friends again.

345
00:19:57,070 --> 00:19:58,405
I regret the fact that I was hoping

346
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:01,158
we could have what we had before.

347
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:05,412
That we could face the start
of our friendship together.

348
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:09,666
And we could pass that on
to our children someday.

349
00:20:10,417 --> 00:20:11,877
But that won't happen, Sam.

350
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:13,712
It won't!

351
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:26,642
Madam Sam… It's not that
I'm siding with George,

352
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:28,977
but she's right.

353
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,313
You already patched things up.

354
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:32,814
Don't you regret it?

355
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:37,861
Barry, stop saying the word mistress.

356
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:41,615
Orly and I were each other's first love.

357
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:45,202
We just picked up from where we left off,

358
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,578
and we reconnected.

359
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,207
So that's not called being a mistress.

360
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,541
<i>Fine.</i>

361
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:55,212
<i>But still, why did you allow</i>
<i>Paco and Samantha</i>

362
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:57,464
<i>to get married?</i>

363
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,883
Stop, please.

364
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,804
Just leave me. I need to be alone.

365
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,784
I objected to that, Barry.

366
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:30,914
But they ran off
and got married behind my back.

367
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,082
There was nothing I could do.

368
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:38,839
And then this woman brought her mother
and Francis, her brother, to my house.

369
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:42,926
Francis, you can leave if you want.

370
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,512
But not you, Samantha.

371
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,764
You are not leaving.

372
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:51,059
If my mother and brother leave,
I will leave too.

373
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,021
We came here as a complete family,
we'll leave this place together.

374
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,106
It's okay.

375
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,984
Francis is gone.

376
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:05,490
One down, one less problem, right?

377
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:10,037
<i>Oh, that's why Francis had to go.</i>

378
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,372
<i>Is that why you had him killed?</i>

379
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:19,463
<i>Silence means yes.</i>

380
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,632
<i>Is that an admission of guilt, Auro?</i>

381
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:25,886
<i>Did you have Francis Castillo killed?</i>

382
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,352
No. No.

383
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:39,232
No… Sam, stop, stop, stop.

384
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,113
It wasn't an admission, Barry.

385
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,991
But I won't deny…

386
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,328
that I'm relieved.

387
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:58,460
Imagine, Francis died
without me doing anything.

388
00:23:00,253 --> 00:23:03,799
So thank you

389
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,967
to whoever ran Francis over, right?

390
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:10,013
No.

391
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,893
No, you won't be carried away
with what George said.

392
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:19,731
You will look for justice for Francis.

393
00:23:25,445 --> 00:23:29,533
Whoever killed him did me a favor.

394
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,284
Too bad,

395
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,537
he only ran over Francis.

396
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,124
He did not include Mercy.

397
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,210
<i>Do you want to get rid of Mercy too?</i>

398
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,003
<i>I know some people.</i>

399
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:44,422
How much?

400
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:47,884
<i>Hello, Auro?</i>

401
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,345
<i>Hello?</i>

402
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:34,848
Can I file a murder case against Ward?

403
00:24:38,435 --> 00:24:41,188
Okay, I'll call you later.

404
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,410
Sergeant Royales.

405
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,373
Do you have an update
on the investigation?

406
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:02,250
Did you get any evidence?

407
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:05,045
Edward Balay has proven his innocence.

408
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:07,464
I came here to tell Ms. Georgina.

409
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:15,263
Thank you, Lord.

410
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,806
Thank you, Lord.

411
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:22,270
We've gotten close because you granted
all that I've prayed for.

412
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,481
Thank you so much.

413
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,066
Where is Ward?

414
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,276
He still doesn't know
that he's been acquitted.

415
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,486
What?

416
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,738
What did you say?

417
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:34,991
That maniac has been acquitted.

418
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,620
Hey, don't you dare call my son a maniac.

419
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,372
Why, Ruth?

420
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:41,581
When it's the truth?

421
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,792
Your son is a maniac. Maniac!

422
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:46,127
Okay, call him a maniac one more time

423
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,379
and I'll let you eat
this pearl necklace of mine.

424
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,005
Is that so?

425
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:50,757
You're so shameless.

426
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,717
You have the guts to threaten me.

427
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:56,221
Why? It's your son's fault
because he's a maniac.

428
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:59,266
He brought my daughter to a motel.

429
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:00,976
A motel, Ruth.

430
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,686
Isn't that being a maniac?

431
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,604
- Really?
- Mom…

432
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,398
- I'll make you eat this pearl necklace!
- Mom, stop.

433
00:26:06,481 --> 00:26:08,441
Your son is a maniac!

434
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:10,193
Mom.

435
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:13,446
Ward is innocent?

436
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,699
We have verified that Ward and Sofia

437
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:17,117
were really in the motel

438
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,286
at the time your brother got run over.

439
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,997
Aside from the records
that the staff gave,

440
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:23,456
a CCTV video of them was taken

441
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,208
by the establishment opposite the motel

442
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:27,836
from the time they went in
till the time they left the motel.

443
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,717
So he was really framed?

444
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:35,385
Yes.

445
00:26:36,011 --> 00:26:38,471
And that's the focus of our investigation.

446
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,974
To know who really did that to him.

447
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,525
Ward still committed a sin against Sofia.

448
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:53,320
Vivian has a right to get mad.

449
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:01,077
Vivian, we know that
what Ward did was wrong.

450
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,332
I will personally talk to him.

451
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:09,336
Please, forgive Ward.
That will never happen again.

452
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:10,295
I will talk to him.

453
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,672
That will never happen again.

454
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,175
George, you better make sure that…

455
00:27:16,009 --> 00:27:20,013
that maniac will never go
near my daughter.

456
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,681
Do we understand each other?

457
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:23,641
Is that clear?

458
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,478
Maniac!

459
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,818
Jericho, I was wrong.

460
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,197
I believed right away
that Ward was guilty.

461
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,325
George was right.

462
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:43,787
We even fought because of this.

463
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,297
Go ahead, Jericho, tell me
what you want to say.

464
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,051
I need that now.

465
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,265
You know that you're wrong,

466
00:28:05,308 --> 00:28:07,644
The problem is you didn't listen

467
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:09,604
to George and Ward's explanation.

468
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,980
You let your anger take control of you.

469
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,192
I know.

470
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:16,111
But this can still be fixed.

471
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,946
Humble yourself.

472
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:21,074
Talk to George and ask for forgiveness.

473
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,285
Don't waste your friendship.

474
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:30,417
No matter what I say or do,
you will not believe me.

475
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:35,004
It's official!
You just lost a friend. Again!

476
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,174
I hope George can still forgive me.

477
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:42,137
She can still forgive you, just trust her.

478
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,310
I'm sorry, George, about what I did.

479
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,648
You're right.

480
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:57,527
Ward is at fault.

481
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:02,741
Not only to Sofia
but to Vivian and Sir Galvan too.

482
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,371
But if Ward has wronged them,

483
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,332
Sam also has a fault with Ward.

484
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,252
She committed a huge sin.

485
00:29:14,836 --> 00:29:16,421
Let's sue them.

486
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,052
What case can we file against them?

487
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,513
Oral defamation? Slander?

488
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,266
Mom, we won't sue Sam anymore.

489
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:29,851
And why not?

490
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:33,229
After everything your brother
went through,

491
00:29:33,313 --> 00:29:38,485
she chose to pin down Ward
than believe us, especially you.

492
00:29:40,278 --> 00:29:41,654
What?

493
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:45,241
That street rat was exonerated?

494
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,494
Yes, madam.

495
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,704
It's not Ward who ran over Francis.

496
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,872
Damn it.

497
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:55,960
Now I'm back in Royales' crosshairs.

498
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:59,756
The investigation will focus on me again.

499
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,425
I don't think so, madam.

500
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:05,053
They don't have strong evidence
against you…

501
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,680
Aside from the gas mask.

502
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:11,518
That definately won't have your DNA.

503
00:30:11,601 --> 00:30:14,270
George, don't tell me
that your heart is getting soft

504
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,730
for that woman.

505
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:18,817
My heart will not soften for Samantha.

506
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,820
She even added to Ward's trauma.

507
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:26,199
Because of her, people see Ward
in a bad light.

508
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,618
They see him as a killer
even if he is innocent.

509
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,871
A maniac even if nothing happened
between him and Sofia.

510
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,083
There you go! Then why can't we sue her?

511
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:37,877
She doesn't matter to me anymore, Mom.

512
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,631
I'd rather focus on finding
the monster who framed Ward

513
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:43,550
than waste my time

514
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:46,135
on the person I want to curse.

515
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:55,687
And one more thing,
they're not focusing on who framed Ward.

516
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,400
Why? Do you think Sam…

517
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:05,113
won't accuse me again

518
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,949
for framing Ward?

519
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,868
You know that woman.

520
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:14,247
Every chance she gets
to pin me down, she'll grab it.

521
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,962
Amando, please leave.

522
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:23,965
Barry is calling.

523
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,175
Get me some more wine, please.

524
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:27,635
Yes, madam.

525
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,407
Ward…

526
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,285
What are you doing here, Sofia?

527
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,085
Hello, Barry.

528
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,173
<i>Auro, darling. Have you thought</i>

529
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,593
<i>about what we said about Mercy last night?</i>

530
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:14,265
What else did we talk about
aside from the charity auction?

531
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,936
<i>The hitman. I know the price tag now.</i>

532
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:24,233
We can't be seen together.

533
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,153
Why? We're not doing anything wrong.

534
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:31,658
I promised your mom and dad
that we'd never see again.

535
00:32:31,741 --> 00:32:32,784
What's with you, Sofia?

536
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,122
You really won't stop bothering Sofia.

537
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,208
Barry…

538
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:44,045
I don't remember us talking about that.

539
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:47,632
And I don't intend to result to murder.

540
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,177
<i>Did you ask me to call</i>
<i>my contact for nothing?</i>

541
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,138
I don't recall asking you for that.

542
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:56,724
Anyway…

543
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:05,108
I have something to give
for the auction of the AS3 Foundation.

544
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,403
Here.

545
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:12,073
Our matching watches with Orly.

546
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,825
<i>Are you serious, Auro?</i>

547
00:33:13,908 --> 00:33:15,284
<i>You'll get rid of them?</i>

548
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:21,124
There's no point in keeping
relics of the past.

549
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,752
<i>Are you erasing the memories of Orly?</i>

550
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:25,837
You too.

551
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,714
- You too, woman.
- Hold on…

552
00:33:27,797 --> 00:33:29,632
You too, you're really a flirt.

553
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,717
- Mommy!
- Cairo…

554
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,176
- I already talk to you, right?
- You know what to do.

555
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,095
You can't talk to each other.

556
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,304
- Mom!
- What?

557
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,556
You really don't listen, don't you?

558
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,766
- Cairo, what will you do?
- You can't come close to him!

559
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,851
I said you can't be with him!

560
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:40,977
Mom, we're really

561
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,186
- not doing anything.
- Don't.

562
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,896
What do you mean
you're not doing anything? You're talking.

563
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,732
You can't talk to each other.

564
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:47,358
- Ward.
- What?

565
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:50,820
Erasing them?

566
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:54,073
Barry, of course not.

567
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:57,118
What Orly and I had…

568
00:33:57,952 --> 00:34:00,872
is forever etched in my heart.

569
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:04,625
<i>But those watches</i>
<i>mean so much more, right?</i>

570
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,086
Well…

571
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,590
That Sam destroyed

572
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:13,551
the good memories of these watches.

573
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:20,224
What's left are the reminders
of the fights I had with that crazy woman.

574
00:34:22,477 --> 00:34:24,812
Why do you have
the same watch as my father?

575
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,982
And why are your names engraved on it?

576
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,693
Answer me.

577
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:32,987
Why do you have matching
watches with my father?

578
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:35,656
<i>But those are keepsakes.</i>

579
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,575
<i>Physical remembrances.</i>

580
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,536
<i>Something that will remind you</i>
<i>of the person you love.</i>

581
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:46,084
I don't need
any physical remembrance, Barry.

582
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:50,213
Orly left me…

583
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:55,968
with something far more precious
than any object.

584
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,847
A living remembrance.

585
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,433
A breathing legacy.

586
00:35:03,142 --> 00:35:05,853
<i>A living what? Oh my God.</i>

587
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,356
<i>Did you have a child with Orly?</i>

588
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:16,030
- Mom…
- Watch this clearly

589
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,615
so you'll learn your lesson.

590
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:20,868
Ward.

591
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:26,707
Ward.

592
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,292
Stop it, stop it.

593
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,795
Dad, tell Cairo to stop, please.

594
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,800
<i>Is that why there was a time</i>

595
00:35:35,883 --> 00:35:38,302
<i>you went missing for one whole year?</i>

596
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,805
<i>Where did have your pregnancy?</i>

597
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,974
<i>Where did you give birth?</i>

598
00:35:44,183 --> 00:35:45,059
What?

599
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:48,187
What nonsense are you talking about?

600
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:49,188
What?

601
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,774
What do you mean got pregnant?

602
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:55,278
What are you talking about, Barry?

603
00:35:55,361 --> 00:35:57,280
<i>Are we going to fool each other, Auro?</i>

604
00:35:57,363 --> 00:36:00,199
Orly and I didn't have a child.

605
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,535
We didn't, Barry.

606
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,957
Dad…

607
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,836
Let this be a lesson to you.

608
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:15,173
Next time you go near my daughter,

609
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,258
you will not only get that.

610
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:20,428
Don't tell George about this.
Do you understand?

611
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,641
Bill…

612
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,811
Take him out.

613
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:33,357
- Ward…
- Ward? What Ward?

614
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,030
- Ward.
- What now?

615
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,711
<i>If you say so.</i>

616
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,405
Sam, maybe they're not ready for you yet.

617
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:24,825
Mom, I won't be at peace
until I apologize to them.

618
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,330
Ward?

619
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:31,374
Ward, what happened to you?

620
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:32,875
Did someone hurt you? Who hurt you?

621
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,502
- Wait.
- Sam, don't.

622
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,379
Ward, wait.

623
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:37,672
Ward, what happened to you?

624
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:41,300
Why did you kill my brother?

625
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,927
You killed him!

626
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:45,596
- Sam…
- You can just beat him up.

627
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,181
Ward, wait. Let's just talk.

628
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,766
I'll just apologize to you.

629
00:37:48,849 --> 00:37:50,226
Sam, no don't. Don't hurt me.

630
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:52,436
- Ward, no. I won't hurt you. Wait.
- I don't want.

631
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:54,438
- I don't want!
- Hold on… Oh!

632
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,790
Hello?

633
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:16,794
Saint Ignatius Mental Facility.

634
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,298
Kindly connect me to Dr. De los Reyes.

635
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,802
Hi, Susan.

636
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,972
How's my…

637
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:31,183
my niece?

638
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,021
<i>Rebecca has responded well</i>
<i>to the psychotic treatment.</i>

639
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,772
<i>Her episodes</i>

640
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,900
<i>have decreased in frequency and intensity.</i>

641
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,444
Great.

642
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:46,657
This is the most hopeful news
I've had in weeks.

643
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,042
Susan, I'm sorry. I'll call you back.

644
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,463
What are you doing here, Amando?

645
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,342
Did you have a child with Orly?

646
00:39:04,884 --> 00:39:06,927
Didn't I tell you, Amando,

647
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,723
to know your place here in my house?

648
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:14,643
You have no right to ask me
anything about me and Orly.

649
00:39:15,227 --> 00:39:16,479
Ward?

650
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:18,272
- Mom, George!
- Ward, wait.

651
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,690
- Ward, stand up there.
- What are you doing

652
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,858
to my brother?

653
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,743
Is it Rebecca?

654
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,163
Is Rebecca your daughter?

655
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:35,998
What the hell?

656
00:39:41,087 --> 00:39:43,381
Get out of my room, Amando!

657
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:44,924
Get out!

658
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:50,721
George, I'm not hurting him.

659
00:39:50,805 --> 00:39:52,348
I just want to apologize to him.

660
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,599
I just want to talk to him.

661
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:55,017
That's true, George.

662
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,107
What did that woman do to you?

663
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,651
George…

664
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,910
Did you do this to him?

665
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,873
No. We saw him sitting there earlier.

666
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:19,458
We just helped him.

667
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,252
Ward, tell the truth.

668
00:40:22,169 --> 00:40:23,254
Ward…

669
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,632
Is she telling the truth? Who did this?

670
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:29,176
It's Cairo, George.

671
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:34,557
Let this be a lesson to you.

672
00:40:35,307 --> 00:40:37,852
Next time you go near my daughter,

673
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,770
you will not only get that.

674
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:43,315
Don't tell George about this.
Do you understand?

675
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,901
Sam ordered him to do this to me.

676
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:48,529
Ward…

677
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:51,866
That's not true.

678
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:05,838
<i>Thank you, Sarge. And you won't stop</i>

679
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,382
<i>from finding out who framed Ward.</i>

680
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,926
<i>I have a strong hunch</i>
<i>that this was done by the mastermind</i>

681
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,303
of the Palacios killer.

682
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,680
If you want to find out
who the mastermind is,

683
00:41:14,763 --> 00:41:17,183
I think you need to assign
a surveillance team

684
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:19,518
for Mom, Aurora, and Uncle Galvan.

685
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,936
I don't want to stay here anymore.

686
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,772
I think it's better if we leave this place

687
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:24,982
so we won't be involved in trouble.

688
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,942
Especially your baby.

689
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:29,695
NEXT EPISODE

690
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:32,198
<i>Aurora, I've loved you</i>
<i>for fifty years already,</i>

691
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:35,201
<i>but you only made me feel it once.</i>

692
00:41:35,284 --> 00:41:37,536
<i>I followed all your orders,</i>

693
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,330
<i>even if I didn't want to.</i>

694
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,457
<i>Even if it was against my will,</i>

695
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:43,876
<i>and no longer right.</i>

696
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,295
What the hell are you doing, Amando?

697
00:41:46,378 --> 00:41:48,464
Stop it! What's with you, Amando?

698
00:41:48,547 --> 00:41:50,591
All the pieces of evidence
are pointing at Ward.

699
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:52,635
You did the same thing for Francis.

700
00:41:52,718 --> 00:41:53,886
You even put him in jail, remember?

701
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,721
Do you think
I have forgotten that already, George?

702
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:57,389
- You're such a fool!
- What's with you?

703
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:59,642
- George?
- Take back what you said!

704
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,352
- Take back what you said!
- You fool!
