1
00:00:50,258 --> 00:00:52,469
What are you doing in George's room?

2
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,721
You're looking for evidence
against her, right?

3
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,933
Yes. I am looking for the murder weapon
that was used to kill Beverly

4
00:00:59,017 --> 00:01:00,852
because I want to clear my name.

5
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,687
George is my suspect too.

6
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:03,646
What is this again?

7
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,733
That woman! She is the one to blame
for George's accident.

8
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,901
Have her investigated!

9
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:10,528
Your daughter killed Beverly,
and then she escaped.

10
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:15,325
Then she orchestrated her own accident
to gain sympathy.

11
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:18,411
Ms. Beverly was the mistress
of your client's husband.

12
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,455
She was pregnant when she arrived.

13
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:21,498
That's motive.

14
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:24,501
And Ms. Georgina has made prior threats
to the life of the victim.

15
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:28,838
The timestamp shows that George was
at the gasoline station at 6:53 p.m.

16
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:30,924
According to your initial investigation,

17
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,344
the murder happened between
6:55 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.

18
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,763
Attorney Morales is right, Sir Palacios.

19
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,639
No!

20
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:40,058
We can't file a case against Ms. Georgina.

21
00:01:40,141 --> 00:01:43,520
There is valid evidence that
disproves our claim.

22
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,230
George, look!

23
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,148
He was supposed to be my grandson!

24
00:01:47,232 --> 00:01:48,775
Sir Galvan, stop it.

25
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:51,236
George's evidence is solid.

26
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,404
- My daughter is innocent.
- Really?

27
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:55,532
The truth is, I wanted Beverly dead

28
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:58,993
after she gave birth
so I could have the baby.

29
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,413
He would've been a way for me
to become a mother.

30
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:03,790
<i>From now on,</i>

31
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,376
someone will keep an eye on you
when you're outside your room.

32
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:08,211
- Why?
- George has an alibi.

33
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,046
Meaning the killer is still free.

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,926
I don't want, Sam, for you
and my grandchild to be next.

35
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,762
<i>Did you know that I tried to</i>
<i>buy him from Beverly?</i>

36
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:18,596
<i>What?</i>

37
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,682
<i>Because I really wanted the baby.</i>

38
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,600
After all, he is Basil's son.

39
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:27,272
He was supposed to be the last memory
Basil left for me. For us.

40
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:28,565
She's telling the truth.

41
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,942
<i>I was there, Dad. I witnessed it.</i>

42
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,735
Sorry, George.

43
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,738
I'm sorry if I accused you
of killing Beverly.

44
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:38,116
I will help with the investigation.

45
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:41,536
I will hunt down the monster
who took away my husband's son.

46
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,413
<i>The person who stabbed Beverly…</i>

47
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,706
I need to find that person.

48
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:48,918
Wait a second, is that the knife
that was used to stab Beverly?

49
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:52,046
PREVIOUSLY

50
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,007
What?

51
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:55,341
Hey, Omeng!

52
00:02:55,425 --> 00:02:59,470
How did it become 250,000 pesos?
I only owe your boss 200,000!

53
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,682
Okay.

54
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,603
Okay, tell him I will find a way.

55
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,069
Sir, can I talk to you?

56
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,905
About what?

57
00:03:17,405 --> 00:03:19,782
About your reward, sir.

58
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,451
Have you heard?

59
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:23,620
George is innocent.

60
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:27,415
But, sir, that wasn't the agreement.

61
00:03:27,498 --> 00:03:31,920
We agreed to tell you where she was,
and we did that.

62
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:32,921
What's this?

63
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,798
Do you want to extort money from me?

64
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,800
Not really, sir.

65
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,093
- I just need to pay…
- Leave.

66
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,097
- I just need to pay something.
- I said leave.

67
00:03:44,515 --> 00:03:45,850
You don't want to leave?

68
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:49,646
Well, I don't want to see
your stupid face!

69
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,693
You're such a snake!

70
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,615
George, Ward,

71
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:01,866
is that the one?

72
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,749
I think that's the one, Mother.

73
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,835
- Look, it has blood on it.
- That's right.

74
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,964
Why is it in your bag, George?

75
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,966
I don't know!

76
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:19,342
Someone must have put it inside my bag.

77
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:21,386
Someone is trying to frame me up again.

78
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,680
Oh no!

79
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:27,183
Oh! What the heck?!

80
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,935
What's going on here?

81
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,483
I heard someone screaming.

82
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,487
What's the fuss all about?

83
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,366
It's Mother. She feels like vomiting.

84
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,827
She had too much wine.

85
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,664
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,666
All right.

87
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,295
George?

88
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:59,090
About Basil's nine-day novena…

89
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,301
I'll take care of it.

90
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,262
Okay.

91
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:14,897
What now, Mother?

92
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,899
What are we going to do with this knife?

93
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,320
Are we going to tell Sergeant Villa?

94
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,698
And then what?
Have them investigate your sister again?

95
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:26,409
I don't want to.
They'll only try to pin it on George.

96
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,702
Just throw that away.

97
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:31,873
Mother, Bev's case hasn't been solved yet.

98
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,500
This is a piece of evidence.

99
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,502
I don't care about Beverly.

100
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,130
I'm only thinking about your sister.

101
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,591
No one will call Sergeant Villa

102
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,926
and no one will throw that away.

103
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,933
I know who it's from.

104
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:54,729
It's the same bitch
who left morphine in my drawer

105
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,939
to frame me up for Basil's death.

106
00:05:57,774 --> 00:06:01,986
Now, she wants me to be blamed
for Beverly's death.

107
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:05,156
Who?

108
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:07,950
Who else but Sam? What's with you?

109
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:12,163
I will return this knife to her.

110
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,915
That's right, George.

111
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,169
So she will be blamed for Beverly's death.

112
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:41,317
Sam, does George really have an alibi?

113
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,569
That's why she's no longer suspected
of being the real killer?

114
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:47,907
Maybe, since I wasn't able to
find evidence against her.

115
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,160
Could it be that she has an accomplice?

116
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:53,079
Ward or Ruth?

117
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,999
Ward has an alibi.

118
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:00,503
He was with Sofia when Beverly was killed.

119
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,549
Auntie Ruth was with the maid.

120
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,512
How about the staff here at the estate?

121
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:12,390
Mother, I know George.

122
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:15,143
She doesn't trust anyone easily.

123
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,728
If she was going to do something
this serious,

124
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:21,649
she wouldn't depend on others,
she'd do it herself.

125
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:26,195
If George didn't kill Beverly,

126
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,864
then who did?

127
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,952
That was my mistake.

128
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,330
I suspected George.

129
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,417
I was so focused on George
that I overlooked the clues

130
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,297
as to who really killed Beverly
and poisoned Basil.

131
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:51,387
Who else has a motive
to kill both of them?

132
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:59,145
If I need to roam around the entire estate
to find the killer, I will do it.

133
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,155
Ma'am Rebecca?

134
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:11,866
Ma'am Rebecca?

135
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,079
Ma'am Rebecca?

136
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,332
Your medicine is here.

137
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,713
Ma'am?

138
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:29,091
It's time to drink your…

139
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,052
What was that?

140
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:38,309
This mansion is really scary.

141
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,271
It's a good thing Nurse Angie
is able to endure this.

142
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,982
Why did that witch go on a leave?

143
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:49,779
Now I'm assigned to Ma'am Rebecca.

144
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,616
What was that?

145
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,849
Ma'am Rebecca?

146
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:22,061
OMG.

147
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:26,816
Ma'am Rebecca got pregnant before?

148
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,408
Wait a second, George.

149
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:38,578
Don't tell me you don't want to
push through with the plan?

150
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:43,416
Mother, what if we just report this
to the police?

151
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,835
And what will we report?

152
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,673
That you found the knife that was used
to kill Beverly in your handbag?

153
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,009
What if they don't believe you?

154
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,343
What if they suspect you?

155
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,264
George, only your car was seen
on the CCTV footage.

156
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,934
What if they say you had someone else
drive it so you'd have an alibi

157
00:10:02,018 --> 00:10:03,436
for killing Beverly?

158
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:08,274
But Mother, we're not sure that it was Sam
who planted it in my bag,

159
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:10,443
or that she killed Beverly.

160
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,194
George…

161
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:17,199
Even now, you still don't believe that
Sam is capable of killing?

162
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,411
Remember how when Paco died,

163
00:10:20,494 --> 00:10:24,415
you suspected her of killing
her own husband?

164
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:29,754
George, who else wants
to put you in danger?

165
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,341
Who else wants to pin everything on you?

166
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:37,053
Ever since we met them,
all she and her family have brought to us

167
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,680
is bad things.

168
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,188
Do I have to remind you

169
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,608
that Sam is the reason
why your father died?

170
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:53,903
- Father! Father!
- Bert! Bert! Bert!

171
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,321
Call an ambulance!

172
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:56,739
Wake up, Father!

173
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,285
The reason our family got destroyed?

174
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:06,040
The reason the three of us got separated
when you needed to go to Singapore?

175
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,335
Take care, George.

176
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,429
And while you were there, what happened?

177
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:24,058
- Idiot! You are so stupid!
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

178
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:27,186
- I'm so sorry!
- You are stupid woman!

179
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,773
Your boss oppressed you, remember?

180
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:32,775
She hurt you.

181
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:37,446
No! No, you can't!

182
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,866
You had a miscarriage.

183
00:11:47,706 --> 00:11:49,291
That's why you can't have a baby now.

184
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,919
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Palacios,

185
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,631
but it will take a miracle
for you to bear a child.

186
00:11:56,382 --> 00:12:01,011
And do you know how Beverly
found out that you were barren?

187
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,348
Mother, I did not kill Beverly.

188
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,100
The only thing I'm guilty of

189
00:12:06,183 --> 00:12:09,019
was telling Beverly that George is barren.

190
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,147
It was Sam.

191
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,732
What?

192
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:17,236
That's why I truly believe

193
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:20,489
that Sam was behind your accident,

194
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,117
that she placed the knife in your bag,

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,454
and that she was the one who put
the morphine in your cabinet.

196
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:39,633
Donita!

197
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:41,260
- Come here quick!
- What's that?

198
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,095
I learned something juicy.

199
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,138
What?

200
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,098
I saw this in the library.

201
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:52,980
Ma'am Rebecca was pregnant?

202
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,693
Yes. Could that be the reason why
she became like she is now?

203
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,029
Does Nurse Angie know?

204
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:02,072
What if we ask her when she comes back?

205
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,574
She's not coming back anymore.

206
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,451
This is just between us,

207
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:10,247
but I saw Sir Amando talking
to Nurse Angie when she was leaving.

208
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,624
She didn't go on leave.

209
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,167
She was fired.

210
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,210
What?

211
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,419
Why?

212
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,629
I don't know.

213
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,757
For sure, Queen Aurora ordered it.

214
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,383
But just keep it quiet.

215
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:23,969
Ma'am Rebecca doesn't know this.

216
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,518
So, Ma'am Rebecca got pregnant?

217
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,020
I wonder where her baby is.

218
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:37,149
I wonder who got her pregnant too.

219
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,859
Yes, I wonder who?

220
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:41,904
Delia, Donita!

221
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,156
What are you gossiping
about Ma'am Rebecca?

222
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,699
Nothing, sir.

223
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,160
I was only showing her
a picture of my niece.

224
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,291
- That's Ma'am Rebecca.
- No, it's my niece.

225
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,419
We're dead.

226
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,338
Oh no.

227
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,302
Where did you get this?

228
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,473
Answer me

229
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:11,559
if you don't want to get in trouble
with Ma'am Aurora.

230
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,061
What do we do?

231
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:16,564
Well?

232
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,225
George?

233
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:37,645
What are you doing here?

234
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:41,148
I just came from Sam's room.
She's not there.

235
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,902
She's temporarily staying
in the guest room.

236
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,320
Auntie Aurora had her things moved

237
00:15:46,403 --> 00:15:49,990
because they were fixing
her and Paco's room.

238
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,117
Why did you follow me here?

239
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,494
George, I will help you.

240
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,038
You just came from the hospital.
You're not that strong yet.

241
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,865
Ouch!

242
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,701
- Stop it.
- Come here, both of you.

243
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:37,746
Come here, both of you.
You fools!

244
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,670
Who gave you the right to feast
on Rebecca's private life?

245
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:48,132
You're so shameless!

246
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,258
Ma'am.

247
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,885
Think about the Kasambahay Bill.

248
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:53,470
They might sue you.

249
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,231
Why are you snooping around in my library?

250
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:09,737
You're only supposed to bring
Rebecca's meds!

251
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,407
Why are you meddling
with my things in my library?

252
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,993
Madam…

253
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,038
I didn't meddle, ma'am.

254
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,582
The book just fell.

255
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,876
- And then…
- And then what?

256
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,377
You meddled!

257
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:29,840
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
seen this picture!

258
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:35,429
I'm sorry, ma'am.

259
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:40,559
Pack your belongings.

260
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,518
Please, don't, ma'am.

261
00:17:41,602 --> 00:17:45,147
You leave this estate now.

262
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:46,774
Madam! Madam!

263
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:48,025
Both of you!

264
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,330
George, give me the knife.

265
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,915
The guard might come back.

266
00:18:02,998 --> 00:18:07,127
Ward, this isn't some game I'm playing
where you can just join in and play too.

267
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,380
I know and I'm serious.

268
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,133
I'm mad at Sam because she set you up.

269
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,302
I also believe what Mother said.

270
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,805
That she's the reason why
you got into that accident.

271
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,017
George, that was painful.
I thought you were dead.

272
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,645
So let me help you, George.

273
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:28,398
I will help you pay Sam back
for what she did to us.

274
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:37,366
Madam, I'm innocent.

275
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:39,201
Delia only told me that story.

276
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:43,038
It's your fault for being nosy
and gossiping!

277
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,708
Oh my God.

278
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,876
Amando!

279
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,253
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.

280
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,170
Forgive us.

281
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,256
Give their separation pay.

282
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:53,298
Madam…

283
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,718
Give them one year's worth of salary.

284
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:58,762
No.

285
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,306
Make it two years.

286
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,685
But make sure they sign the NDA.

287
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:06,270
Yes, madam.

288
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,858
- Ma'am, forgive us.
- Forgive us.

289
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:15,320
Don't tell a soul about any of this.

290
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,031
- Or I swear to God…
- Yes.

291
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:21,201
…I will hunt you down,
you and your family.

292
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:23,370
Do you understand me?

293
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:25,289
- Yes.
- Madam, I'm sorry.

294
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:29,042
Now get the hell out of my sight!

295
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,127
Now!

296
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,753
Leave!

297
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,508
Hurry!

298
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,080
Amando,

299
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:12,377
I told you to burn
all those damn pictures.

300
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,693
Ward, don't.

301
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:38,445
Just go back to the house.

302
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,531
George, why won't you let me help you?

303
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,035
Ward, don't get involved
in the problems of grownups.

304
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:48,247
Just focus on your own issues in life.

305
00:20:49,164 --> 00:20:51,333
George, I'm already involved.

306
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:55,170
If Sam succeeds and you go to jail,

307
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,130
I'll be affected too, right?

308
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,008
George,

309
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:05,639
I wasn't able to help
when Father died because of the Castillos.

310
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,225
I was so young then.

311
00:21:08,809 --> 00:21:13,313
But I can help you now,
so give me the knife.

312
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,489
Be careful, Ward,

313
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:24,283
Yes, George.

314
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:27,577
Put it in an area
where Sam can't easily find it,

315
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:30,956
but where Sergeant Villa will find it
if they conduct a search.

316
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,374
Be careful.

317
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:49,321
Guard?

318
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,664
Sam.

319
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:00,790
Sam.

320
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:05,420
Sam.

321
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,547
Sam!

322
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,674
Sam, my dear.

323
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,968
Sam! Sam, my dear.

324
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,845
- Sam.
- Mother, what happened?

325
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:14,846
Sam.

326
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:31,196
Didn't you say you weren't able
to get information about Papa

327
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,782
when you went to St. Ignatius?

328
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:38,536
We might find something else
where we're heading.

329
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,040
Where are we going?

330
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:47,003
Papa has a small cottage in the woods.

331
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,463
It was like his office.

332
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:53,510
We might find something
that could help us in finding him.

333
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,053
Like, I don't know…

334
00:25:56,096 --> 00:25:57,639
Like an address book.

335
00:25:58,348 --> 00:25:59,933
I followed your orders, madam.

336
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,644
Not only the pictures

337
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,106
but any evidence of the fact that
Ma'am Rebecca got pregnant,

338
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,482
I turned into ashes.

339
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,735
So how do you explain that picture?

340
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:14,197
Maybe Ma'am Rebecca was able
to hide it before she got sick.

341
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,365
I'm sorry, madam.

342
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:20,245
Most likely, she wasn't able to see this.

343
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,664
She could have, Amando.

344
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,333
So search the entire mansion

345
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:30,880
and make sure that there are no other
copies of that picture of Rebecca.

346
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:33,967
Yes, madam.

347
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,894
It was bad, Sam.

348
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:46,896
I dreamt of you.

349
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,108
- Why are you crying?
- Someone was stabbing you.

350
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,027
Just like what happened to Beverly.

351
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:56,156
Mother, stop crying.
It was just a dream.

352
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,615
Just stay here for now. Sit here.

353
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,243
- It was just a dream.
- It felt so real.

354
00:27:00,327 --> 00:27:02,412
- It felt so real, Sam.
- Mother.

355
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,789
- I saw it clearly.
- I'll get you a glass of water.

356
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,917
Goodness! Mother, calm down.

357
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,085
Sam…

358
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,756
It was just a dream.

359
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,383
I will get you a glass of water
to help calm you down.

360
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,885
Hold on.

361
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:19,346
Mother.

362
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,182
Mother, just a moment.

363
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:32,734
And we can contact the people he knows
and ask around.

364
00:27:33,568 --> 00:27:35,028
Yeah, all right.

365
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,363
We can do that.

366
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,789
Why did you stop?

367
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:49,167
I saw someone.

368
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,259
Sam!

369
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,971
- Mother…
- Sam, it felt so real.

370
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,640
I saw the killer.

371
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,308
I saw the killer.
He was holding the knife.

372
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:06,851
- He was stabbing you.
- It was just a dream.

373
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,396
- He kept on stabbing you.
- Drink some water first.

374
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,816
- Mother, drink some water first. Come on.
- He was stabbing you repeatedly.

375
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,568
- I don't want that to happen.
- It was just a dream, Mother.

376
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,820
Come on.

377
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,281
Rebecca.

378
00:28:22,742 --> 00:28:23,910
Ma'am Rebecca.

379
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,040
What are you doing here?

380
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,710
I saw someone there.

381
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:34,754
Go and check.

382
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,151
I'll take you to your room.

383
00:28:57,277 --> 00:29:00,155
And don't go out yet.
It's still dangerous.

384
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,788
Come on, I'll fix your bed.

385
00:29:08,872 --> 00:29:11,541
- Are you sure you're okay?
- I'm okay, Mother.

386
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,543
How about the baby?

387
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,549
You sure you're okay, Mother?

388
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,261
No, I need to go somewhere.

389
00:29:23,344 --> 00:29:28,725
Ma'am, Ma'am Aurora gave instructions
not to let you go out

390
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,686
until they have found the person
who stabbed Ma'am Bev.

391
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,480
So let's go.

392
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,191
Okay.

393
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,330
It felt so real, Sam.

394
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,625
My dream.

395
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:03,384
Why are your clothes on the floor?

396
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:04,844
They were fine before, Mother.

397
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:06,596
I will fix it. Don't worry about it.

398
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:09,182
- It's okay.
- No, wait. I will tidy them.

399
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:10,600
I will tidy them.

400
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:13,520
Oh!

401
00:30:17,023 --> 00:30:18,191
Mother?

402
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,485
What happened, Mother?

403
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,861
What's that?

404
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,279
- What?
- There's…

405
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:33,248
Before Ma'am George threatened
Ma'am Beverly during the party,

406
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:40,338
Ma'am George had already scared
Ma'am Beverly using a pig's head.

407
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:48,805
There was a knife in the pig's head,
and… the handle was orange.

408
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,020
- Ma'am Rebecca.
- Yes?

409
00:30:56,104 --> 00:30:57,730
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

410
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:28,219
Why is there a knife there, Sam?
Who placed that there?

411
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,471
I don't know.
It wasn't there earlier, Mother.

412
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:36,144
A knife.

413
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:41,274
Wait, isn't that the knife that
was used to kill Beverly?

414
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:45,987
There's blood. There's dried blood.

415
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:48,823
What?

416
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,961
Mother, did you touch the knife?

417
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,186
George, let's go. Hurry up!

418
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,270
Hurry.

419
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:21,314
Mother, did you touch the knife?

420
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:24,108
No. I didn't touch it, Sam.

421
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,277
Mother, are you sure?
Maybe it has your fingerprints on it.

422
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:29,405
No, Sam, I didn't touch it.
But why is it there?

423
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:30,740
Who placed it there?

424
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,200
- I don't know.
- Why is it in your laundry?

425
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:34,118
I don't know. I don't know.

426
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,286
Maybe it's the killer.

427
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:36,329
Oh my God.

428
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,206
- Oh my God!
- That means…

429
00:32:38,831 --> 00:32:40,583
the killer got inside your room?

430
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:43,169
Did the killer enter your room?

431
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,921
I don't know, Mother.
I don't know.

432
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,923
Do you mean

433
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:49,425
the killer came inside your room?

434
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:53,096
- Someone was in your room.
- I think so, Mother.

435
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:54,847
My God!

436
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,267
Someone wants to set me up.

437
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,560
Someone…

438
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:02,105
wants to frame me for Beverly's death.

439
00:33:02,188 --> 00:33:03,648
Oh my God!

440
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,108
What are we going to do?

441
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:11,823
- Was it a success?
- Yes, Mother.

442
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,450
That's good to hear!
I've been so worried this whole time.

443
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,202
What are we waiting for? Let's go home.

444
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,286
You can go ahead, Mother.

445
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,621
I'll call Sergeant Villa.

446
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:20,915
He needs to see the knife in Sam's things.

447
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:21,791
All right.

448
00:33:21,874 --> 00:33:23,501
Follow us right after, okay?

449
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,502
Okay.

450
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:26,254
George, hurry up, okay?

451
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:27,964
I got so worried about you.

452
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,924
That was tiring.

453
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,810
We need to dispose of that, Mother.

454
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,187
We need to dispose of it.

455
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,149
No, we can't, Sam.

456
00:33:46,232 --> 00:33:48,192
Let's show it to the police.

457
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:50,069
To Sergeant Villa. Let's show that to him.

458
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:51,362
- That's the right thing to do.
- Mother, no!

459
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:53,698
The police will just suspect me more
if they see that.

460
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,199
That's what the killer wants!

461
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,160
No, Sam.

462
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:58,077
We need…

463
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,830
We need to do the right thing.

464
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,914
I don't want…

465
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,541
I don't want…

466
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:05,501
I don't want you to go to jail, Sam.

467
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,336
You can't!

468
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:09,881
Francis is already in jail.

469
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,425
You can't go to jail too.

470
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,010
Mother, I won't go to jail.

471
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,261
- You can't.
- I won't go to jail.

472
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,805
We need to do the right thing.

473
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:34,572
Sergeant Villa, please answer my call.

474
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,824
I've been calling you for some time now.

475
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,482
Sam?

476
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,282
How is she, Cairo?

477
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:22,120
She's looking for Nurse Angie and Delia.

478
00:35:22,203 --> 00:35:25,456
She only wants them to bring her food.

479
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,667
Did you tell her my instructions?

480
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,627
Yes, madam.

481
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:33,548
She knows that Nurse Angie's
leave was extended

482
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:36,509
and that Delia had a family emergency.

483
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:39,512
Good, Cairo.

484
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:44,142
Rebecca doesn't need to know
that they are not coming back

485
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:48,896
because if she finds out,
she will have a meltdown for sure.

486
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:51,649
Nurse Angie won't be coming back?

487
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,485
What will happen to Ma'am Rebecca?

488
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,195
Who will be her nurse?

489
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:01,909
Am I paying you to ask questions, Cairo?

490
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,874
Leave us.

491
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:09,333
Yes, madam.

492
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:39,780
You're now caught red-handed, Sam.

493
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,658
You want to dispose of the evidence?

494
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,375
Jail will be waiting for you, Sam.

495
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:13,773
I'm so sorry, my dear Rebecca.

496
00:37:15,983 --> 00:37:19,654
Your nurse will no longer come back
because she's incompetent.

497
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:21,948
And the other maids…

498
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:25,785
I had to get rid of them so that

499
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:32,625
they wouldn't tell you
what they discovered.

500
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:44,428
I'm so sorry, Rebecca.

501
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,016
I needed to do that…

502
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:53,813
to protect you.

503
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,109
To protect our family.

504
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:34,979
Hello, Sergeant Villa?

505
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,939
Finally, you answered my call.

506
00:38:38,065 --> 00:38:39,859
I have something to report to you.

507
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,812
Jerico!

508
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,490
Sam!

509
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,116
Sam!

510
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,326
Sam, the police are here.

511
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,994
I think they found something.

512
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,662
Let's go!

513
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,626
Let's go!

514
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,479
What's going on here?

515
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,940
Someone gave the detective a tip.

516
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:05,069
Someone saw Sam burying
something here last night.

517
00:40:05,611 --> 00:40:06,570
What?

518
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,032
We'll find out soon, ma'am.

519
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,284
But my source suspects

520
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:15,287
a murder weapon was buried here
by Ms. Samantha.

521
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,470
It was Sam who killed Ma'am Beverly?

522
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,890
Maybe it was Ms. Mercy.

523
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:37,518
That's impossible.

524
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,395
She's the last person I'd suspect.

525
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,147
Bro, let me give you a pro tip.

526
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,483
Don't you know that
the last person you'd suspect

527
00:40:44,567 --> 00:40:46,777
often turns out to be the killer?

528
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,781
- Is that so?
- Yes.

529
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:02,877
Sam!

530
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,504
Did you bury something there?

531
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,575
They said it was here,
but there's nothing.

532
00:41:34,658 --> 00:41:36,368
We still haven't found anything.

533
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:44,126
Sir, negative.

534
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:46,253
We didn't find anything buried here.

535
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,171
What?

536
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:48,631
What is this?

537
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:49,840
Were you pranked?

538
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:52,718
I don't think so, Mr. Palacios.

539
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:57,056
We always verify
all the information given to us.

540
00:41:57,932 --> 00:42:00,809
Who gave you the tip,
and why did you believe it?

541
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,822
I can't tell you who our source is

542
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:19,995
because we need to protect their identity
in accordance with the law.

543
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,751
But I believe my source

544
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:28,963
because our source sent a video.

545
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,530
So, it's true.

546
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,866
Sam! You did bury something here.

547
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:01,620
Ms. Samantha…

548
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:05,291
What did you bury here last night?

549
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:12,089
Detective, you cannot force
my client to answer you.

550
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,013
She has all the right to remain silent

551
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:21,265
and not answer any of your questions.

552
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:23,392
Let me see the video.

553
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,791
Let me talk to my client first.

554
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:50,252
Mrs. Palacios,

555
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:53,130
do you have any room in the house
that we can utilize?

556
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:54,131
What for?

557
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:55,466
Legal matters.

558
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:58,093
All right.

559
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,205
We are surrendering
a potential murder weapon

560
00:44:26,288 --> 00:44:29,083
that may have been used
in killing Beverly Maison,

561
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,919
which my client found inside her room.

562
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:36,465
The real murderer, whom you have
not apprehended yet,

563
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:38,759
tried to…

564
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:41,970
frame my client.

565
00:44:42,054 --> 00:44:44,807
I informed her
that she may be facing charges

566
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:48,143
of tampering with evidence
and obstruction of justice

567
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:50,020
if she does not show that evidence.

568
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:54,733
But she is ready because she is innocent.

569
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:58,445
My client's fingerprints
are not on that knife.

570
00:44:59,238 --> 00:45:01,407
She never touched that.

571
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,243
Attorney…

572
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:08,831
your client could've wiped this, right?

573
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,543
Excuse me?

574
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:18,382
Are you insinuating
that Sam stabbed Beverly?

575
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,053
Detective,

576
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:28,225
you should know that
if you wipe off the fingerprints,

577
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,436
the bloodstains will also be erased.

578
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:40,654
Ms. Samantha, is this what you
buried last night?

579
00:45:41,655 --> 00:45:42,865
Yes, Sarge.

580
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,242
Then why did you not surrender
this to us right away?

581
00:45:49,037 --> 00:45:50,581
Because I panicked.

582
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,251
I didn't know what to do that's why…

583
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,339
I thought of burying the murder weapon.

584
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:01,884
But while I was doing it,

585
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,596
I changed my mind.

586
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,432
Why did you change your mind?

587
00:46:11,894 --> 00:46:14,313
Because I know it's
a strong piece of evidence

588
00:46:14,396 --> 00:46:16,773
that could lead to finding out
who killed Beverly

589
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:20,277
and also help with solving Basil's case.

590
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,871
George…

591
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:36,460
Can we talk?

592
00:46:53,852 --> 00:46:55,604
Detective, we have CCTV footage.

593
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:57,314
It's all shadows. He was good
at avoiding the CCTV.

594
00:46:57,397 --> 00:46:58,815
Just like the person who killed Beverly,

595
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,652
he knew where all the CCTVs
were placed in the estate.

596
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,821
Bro, help me get the reward
from Sir Galvan.

597
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:06,406
I don't want Sir Galvan to get mad at me.

598
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:08,742
You're no longer interested in money
because you'll soon be rich.

599
00:47:08,825 --> 00:47:11,119
Are you going to tell them
that you're a Palacios?

600
00:47:11,203 --> 00:47:13,038
<i>I think I know who the killer is.</i>

601
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:16,083
And I also know who sent the video
to Sergeant Villa.

602
00:47:16,166 --> 00:47:19,711
Whoever poisoned Basil
is the same person who killed Beverly.

603
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,755
- And who could it be, Sam?
- Jerico.

604
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:24,591
Let's tell everyone that
you're a Palacios!

605
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,553
The moment anyone finds out that
I'm a Palacios, I will kill you.

606
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:28,428
Are you a killer?

607
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:31,139
He was the one who told Uncle Galvan
that you were in the hospital.

608
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:32,849
He reported you.
Him and Peter!

609
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,310
What are you doing?
You're stealing Basil's watches?

610
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:37,229
- I said give me that.
- This is mine, ma'am!

611
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,772
- Pa! Pa!
- Ma'am!

612
00:47:38,855 --> 00:47:41,525
