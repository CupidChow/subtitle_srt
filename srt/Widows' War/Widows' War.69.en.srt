1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,851
<i>Forgive me, Lord,</i>
<i>for my evil plan against Sam.</i>

2
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:20,311
I don't want to take revenge
on Sam anymore.

3
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,938
<i>I don't want us to fight again.</i>

4
00:00:22,021 --> 00:00:25,191
<i>That's why I'm going to give</i>
<i>her baby back to her.</i>

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:28,111
I'm so glad you changed your mind.

6
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,487
You imbeciles.

7
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:33,992
None of you called me to tell me
that Samantha and Georgina were missing.

8
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,410
You're all fired.

9
00:00:35,493 --> 00:00:36,911
Try to fire me, Aurora.

10
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,164
I'm going to reveal your deepest secret.

11
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,958
Son, this is your Mommy George?

12
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,086
She loves you as much as I love you.

13
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,212
I'm Paco's father.

14
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:47,922
Amando, enough!

15
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:51,050
Does Paco know
that this jerk is his father?

16
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:51,968
Of course not.

17
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:55,138
I'm not stupid enough
to tell Paco about my one-night mistake.

18
00:00:55,221 --> 00:01:00,101
I've dedicated my entire life
to serving Aurora, to all of you!

19
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:01,311
Ungrateful people.

20
00:01:01,936 --> 00:01:03,646
Galvan…

21
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,982
Thank God you are safe.

22
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,233
Is that my grandson?

23
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,194
Your grandson and Aunt Ruth's.

24
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,446
We are the baby's family too.

25
00:01:11,529 --> 00:01:12,781
<i>You've already given birth, Sam.</i>

26
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:14,866
Can I look at him?

27
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,367
He looks like Paco.

28
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,328
My grandson…

29
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,081
Get him away from here
while you still have time.

30
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:23,666
Mom Aurora won't take him from me.

31
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,170
Hurry up before
the Palacios killer attacks again.

32
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,383
We're leaving the house. How about you?

33
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:33,384
<i>We're on our way out too.</i>

34
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:35,428
<i>Let's just meet in the garage.</i>

35
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:37,055
<i>Wait, Aunt Aurora?</i>

36
00:01:37,138 --> 00:01:38,515
I'm ready.

37
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:39,933
I'm carrying Francis' gun.

38
00:01:40,517 --> 00:01:41,684
Samantha.

39
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,527
You're not bringing my grandson anywhere.

40
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:54,989
Stop it.

41
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,534
You will never get my son.

42
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:04,833
Give me my grandson.

43
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,293
Amando, stop them.

44
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,504
Amando is gone.

45
00:02:09,587 --> 00:02:11,464
You fired him, remember?

46
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:14,968
You fired the only person
who would follow your every whim.

47
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,386
So, he is gone.

48
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:17,637
No one will help you.

49
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,514
Oh, yeah, Samantha?

50
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:24,227
Well, I don't need Amando's help
or anyone else's.

51
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:28,022
I challenge you

52
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:30,942
to use that against me.

53
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:35,238
I accept your challenge.

54
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:40,994
Jerico, cover the kid's ears.

55
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,878
What the hell, Samantha?

56
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:52,714
- Did you just shoot?
- I did.

57
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:56,050
And I won't hesitate
to shoot this in your skull

58
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,761
if you try to take my son.

59
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,064
George, wait.

60
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,610
Are you leaving?

61
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,778
Yes, Dad.

62
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,573
We want peace.

63
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,452
Aren't you going
to change your mind, George?

64
00:03:24,662 --> 00:03:25,872
Not anymore, Dad.

65
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,291
Sam and I have decided.

66
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,168
George,

67
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,796
please don't leave Daddy and me.

68
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:35,757
Please. We're a family.

69
00:03:38,092 --> 00:03:39,761
Yes, we are, Sofia.

70
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,347
But, Sam and I share a son now.

71
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,182
His safety is our priority.

72
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:48,353
We can't stay here
while Aunt Aurora threatens our child,

73
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,898
and while the Palacios killers
and the mastermind are at large.

74
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:55,276
We'll do everything
to protect the baby from Aurora.

75
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,239
Just please, George. Don't leave.

76
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,741
I'm sorry, Dad, but…

77
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,578
I don't believe you can
protect us from Aunt Aurora.

78
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:10,250
Maybe she'll even connive with you
in her plan to get the baby.

79
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,046
What are you trying to say, George?

80
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,426
Dad, Aunt Aurora is manipulative,

81
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,095
and conniving.

82
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,764
Not that I don't trust you. I do, Dad.

83
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,767
But, remember,

84
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,645
she can sway your decisions, right?

85
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,148
Remember what she did to Iñigo…

86
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,777
I mean, Antonio's parents?

87
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,822
She made you agree to her scheme.

88
00:04:42,782 --> 00:04:43,950
<i>Aren't you worried?</i>

89
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,288
Sergeant Royales will dig up
what you did to the Beringguelas.

90
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:50,873
What do you mean by "I did"?

91
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,125
We did.

92
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,043
Aurora, I was against it,

93
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:56,129
but you forced me.

94
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,922
Calm down.

95
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,552
Aunt Aurora is your sister.

96
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,721
You love her.

97
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,974
She can use that love to influence you.

98
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,603
You're right, George…

99
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,065
Because I love that spoiled bitch
and she knows

100
00:05:16,566 --> 00:05:19,986
how to manipulate me
to get what she wants.

101
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,323
I'm such a weakling…

102
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,534
especially when it comes to my sister.

103
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:32,749
I thought I could stand my ground,

104
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:34,959
but I was wrong.

105
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:37,587
I'm weak.

106
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,465
I'm so weak.

107
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,093
You just love Aunt Aurora

108
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:47,221
and you can't refuse her or reject her.

109
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:51,476
But, Dad. I hope one day,
you'll learn to say no to her.

110
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,021
I can't guarantee
that I can protect the baby

111
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:58,733
until I learn to say no to Aurora.

112
00:06:01,986 --> 00:06:03,571
I won't stop you.

113
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:09,118
But, George. Please promise me…

114
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:12,622
you'll still visit me here.

115
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:15,792
We'll still be a family.

116
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:55,623
Bill?

117
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,545
What are you doing here?

118
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,297
Didn't Aurora fire you?

119
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:05,675
Yes.

120
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:08,302
And you just let
Ma'am Aurora do that to me

121
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,804
even though you're my boss.

122
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,192
Ma'am George, are we going?

123
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:26,863
Ah…

124
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:32,201
Sir Galvan, I'm sorry.
I wasn't able to inform you.

125
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:36,330
Bill asked if George and I could hire him.

126
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:40,501
Well, he seems trustworthy, so I agreed.

127
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,172
This is what you're saying, George.

128
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,173
You're right.

129
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:49,635
I have this habit of letting Aurora
do whatever she wants.

130
00:07:49,719 --> 00:07:53,306
Even with my employees… she can fire them.

131
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,685
Come on. We'll walk you out.

132
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:05,318
Bill, keep a close eye on George,

133
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:06,819
especially the baby.

134
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,280
Let's go.

135
00:08:22,043 --> 00:08:25,129
Don't follow us or else
we'll end up killing each other.

136
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:26,714
Really, Samantha?

137
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,424
Are you willing to kill?

138
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,593
Yes. For my son, yes.

139
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,262
So, don't you dare follow us.

140
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,598
Come on.

141
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:47,777
Don't follow us.

142
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,404
Stay there.

143
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,281
Why?

144
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:53,824
Sam…

145
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,826
Check the lights.

146
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,163
Nothing, Mom.

147
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,219
<i>Hello, sis.</i>

148
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,221
We lost power here.

149
00:09:15,304 --> 00:09:18,057
Here too, but we're
on our way to the garage.

150
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,892
Okay, us too.

151
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,687
- Come on.
- Let's go.

152
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,729
Don't follow us.

153
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:24,897
Sam…

154
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,692
- Come on.
- Help. Help.

155
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,151
Rico.

156
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,028
- Jerico…
- Rico, what happened?

157
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,029
It's Kenneth…

158
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,906
<i>Kenneth.</i>

159
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:35,616
Kenneth…

160
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,659
Why?

161
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,786
What happened?

162
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,955
Someone stabbed Kenneth.

163
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:43,207
- What?
- Oh, my God.

164
00:09:49,797 --> 00:09:52,258
Sis, did I hear that right?

165
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:54,802
Someone stabbed the security guard
over there?

166
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,933
Hello, sis?

167
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,393
Hello?

168
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,980
I lost signal.

169
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:07,440
Me too, George.

170
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:11,819
Me too.

171
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:12,945
Why is that?

172
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,409
George, did a guard really
get stabbed in the other house?

173
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,494
The Palacios killer attacked us again.

174
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,663
- I'm scared.
- Mom…

175
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:31,213
What now? Why did the power go out now?

176
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,425
- Go back inside for George. Go.
- Okay, sir.

177
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:39,305
Jomar.

178
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,098
Jomar.

179
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,684
Why are you just sitting there?
Turn on the generator.

180
00:10:44,602 --> 00:10:45,519
Jomar.

181
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,063
Jomar.

182
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:54,362
You're all demons.

183
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,907
Get ready for me, especially you, Galvan.

184
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:00,493
You'll see…

185
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:03,913
how this poor man will retaliate.

186
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:06,624
Do you think I'm afraid
of someone like you?

187
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,084
Stop it.

188
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,378
Amando, get out of here.

189
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,671
Get out of my house.

190
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,007
Get out of our lives.

191
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:31,732
Why is that?

192
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,819
- Why did we all lose signal?
- Yes, that's right…

193
00:11:35,903 --> 00:11:38,239
Ma'am, the cell site is close to here.

194
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,865
Maybe it got hit by lightning earlier.

195
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:43,994
Bill, let me borrow your radio.

196
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,539
I need to contact Jerico to talk to Sam.

197
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:47,873
Can I do that here?

198
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,042
Yes, you can call Ma'am Sam.

199
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:51,794
It's a full duplex.

200
00:11:51,877 --> 00:11:53,796
Bill, where is Dad?

201
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,048
He is left outside.
He said to come back here for you.

202
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,091
No.

203
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,385
The Palacios killer might follow him.

204
00:11:59,468 --> 00:12:00,678
Let's go to him.

205
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:01,637
Let's go, Sofia.

206
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,730
Oh, what was that?

207
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,649
Dad.

208
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,239
Ward, don't go out yet.

209
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,041
Bill, open the door.

210
00:12:31,709 --> 00:12:33,210
- Dad.
- Dad.

211
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,503
Sir Galvan…

212
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:45,014
The Palacios killer killed Jomar.

213
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:48,058
Good thing, I got his gun.

214
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:50,728
I shot him, but he escaped.

215
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,522
Dad. Dad.

216
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,523
Dad, you're bleeding.

217
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,652
He stabbed me. He attacked me,

218
00:12:59,153 --> 00:12:59,987
but I'm fine.

219
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,324
I'm okay, Sofia.

220
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:10,289
Rico, did you see who stabbed Kenneth?

221
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,000
When I got there, he was dead already.

222
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:16,587
Maybe the Palacios killer stabbed him.

223
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,672
Maybe we'll all be killed.

224
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,716
We need to get help.

225
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,384
Let's call Sergeant Royales.

226
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:25,513
Mercy, get away from Rico.

227
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,058
How can we call for help?

228
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:31,769
Maybe the cell tower was
struck by lightning.

229
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,271
So, our phones have no signal.

230
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,066
Rico…

231
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,110
Maybe you're the Palacios killer.

232
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,987
Not me.

233
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,698
Then why are you still here?

234
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,159
I fired you already, right?

235
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,371
Jerico, Sam…

236
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,834
- George?
<i>- Sis…</i>

237
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:59,338
<i>Sis, the Palacios killer also</i>
<i>stabbed the security guard here.</i>

238
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:01,048
<i>He also attacked Dad.</i>

239
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,300
He also stabbed him.

240
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:04,218
<i>Oh, my God…</i>

241
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,138
Is Galvan okay?

242
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,015
I'm fine, Aurora.

243
00:14:10,099 --> 00:14:11,141
I'm okay.

244
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,020
Ruth is right.

245
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:22,278
The Palacios killer is
still here in the compound.

246
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:29,368
It's not me.

247
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:32,830
I am here, see.
How could I have stabbed Sir Galvan?

248
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:35,958
Cairo?

249
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,960
Where is Cairo?

250
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,420
I don't know, Ma'am.

251
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:40,838
We were supposed to meet
at the guardhouse.

252
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,673
We were planning to leave together.

253
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:46,010
Maybe the killer stabbed him too.

254
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,470
Maybe he's the Palacios killer.

255
00:14:57,688 --> 00:14:58,689
Stay here.

256
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,072
Help me.

257
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,282
That's Cairo.

258
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,451
<i>The Palacios killer attacked me.</i>

259
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:12,453
Don't open the door.

260
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,750
Bill, open the door.

261
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,252
Help.

262
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:28,177
Cairo…

263
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,349
- Cairo, hey…
- Help Cairo.

264
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,370
Cairo, what happened?

265
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:59,708
He slashed my neck.

266
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:04,088
Luckily, I escaped
and I was able to dodge.

267
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,341
If…

268
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:09,843
If it's not Cairo,

269
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:13,430
it's Amando, Galvan.

270
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,598
Remember?

271
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,600
He threatened us earlier.

272
00:16:17,267 --> 00:16:20,229
That's why I suspected him
of attacking me.

273
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,109
He also told us earlier
to hurry up and leave

274
00:16:25,192 --> 00:16:27,194
before the Palacios killer attacks again.

275
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,237
Didn't he, Sam?

276
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,488
Yes.

277
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,365
It seems he knows what's going to happen.

278
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:33,367
Get him out of here…

279
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,203
while you still have time.

280
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,455
That's exactly what we planned.

281
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:41,834
Mom Aurora won't be able
to get him from me.

282
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,627
Hurry up and leave.

283
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,548
Before the Palacios killer attacks again.

284
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,260
It's him.

285
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,512
It's Amando…

286
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:56,807
Amando is the Palacios killer.

287
00:16:57,725 --> 00:16:58,851
Aurora.

288
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:04,189
So, now you're accusing me
of being the Palacios killer?

289
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,193
<i>All of you?</i>

290
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:18,328
I was just in my room packing.

291
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,039
I just came out now.

292
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:26,253
The killer is outside,

293
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,839
not inside the two houses.

294
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:33,218
So, instead of you accusing others,

295
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:37,222
can we just find a way
to contact the police,

296
00:17:38,682 --> 00:17:40,726
so someone can help us get out?

297
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,562
<i>But, Sir Amando has a point.</i>

298
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,440
No one was killed inside the two houses.

299
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:51,528
It means the killer is outside,
not inside, not here with us.

300
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:55,616
Guards.

301
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,160
Guards, answer me.

302
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,244
Guards.

303
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:35,155
Samantha…

304
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:38,283
Can I carry my grandson?

305
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,701
No.

306
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,455
And why not, Mercy?

307
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:44,957
He's my grandson too.

308
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,710
I have all the right
to cradle my grandson.

309
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:50,295
Samantha…

310
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:52,381
please.

311
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,925
Even just for now.

312
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,885
Please.

313
00:19:10,858 --> 00:19:11,692
Jericho…

314
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:25,873
Hello.

315
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:34,965
Oh, my grandson.

316
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,970
You remind me so much of Paco…

317
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,515
when he was a baby.

318
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:47,561
You certainly look like him.

319
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:06,705
What are we going to do?

320
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,708
There's a… There's a lot of us.

321
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:12,502
Why… Why don't we go out together?

322
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,504
It's too risky, Ward.

323
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,133
Who could the killer be?

324
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:20,886
Sam,

325
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,346
<i>who's there with you</i>

326
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:25,933
<i>so we know who is missing?</i>
<i>He might be the killer.</i>

327
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,100
In this house, it's me,

328
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:31,480
Cairo, Bill, Dad, Mom, Sofia, and Ward.

329
00:20:31,563 --> 00:20:37,694
Here it's, Mom, Jericho,
Mom Aurora, Rico, and Amando.

330
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:42,532
Ando is not with you?

331
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,493
No, Aunt Ruth.

332
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:47,287
He must be the Palacios killer.

333
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,588
<i>Sir Galvan, Sir Galvan…</i>

334
00:20:56,672 --> 00:20:58,006
Who is this?

335
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,551
<i>It's Albert… Albert?</i>

336
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:04,304
<i>Sir, I was stabbed.</i>

337
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,558
Albert, did you see who stabbed you?

338
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,145
<i>No, he was wearing a gas mask</i>

339
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,773
<i>and a black raincoat.</i>

340
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,441
<i>He ran.</i>

341
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:18,944
<i>He ran to Ma'am Aurora's house.</i>

342
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:23,699
Oh, my God.

343
00:21:23,782 --> 00:21:25,742
Sam, be careful there.

344
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,161
Jericho, and Amando, please protect them.

345
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,623
So, Ando is the killer?

346
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,835
Maybe he's already inside.

347
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:39,214
We need to get out of here.
We need to find a safer place to hide.

348
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:40,716
I'll search.

349
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:43,427
Jericho, join them here.

350
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,358
Oh, my God.

351
00:21:58,442 --> 00:22:01,570
The killer is already
inside Aunt Aurora's house.

352
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:03,405
Sam and my baby…

353
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:23,216
Sir Amando hasn't returned yet.

354
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,845
Jericho,

355
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:32,350
I don't like this.

356
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:35,729
Something is off for some time now.

357
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:37,856
You noticed it too?

358
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,066
Yes.

359
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,818
Amando is suspicious.

360
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:46,156
And when he found out
that the killer came here,

361
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:51,161
he suddenly volunteered
to look for a place to hide.

362
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,539
And then he suddenly left.

363
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,167
What if he and Ando are conniving?

364
00:22:58,335 --> 00:23:00,962
And then he has a plan to kill all of us?

365
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,549
Mother…

366
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:07,135
Mother, let's leave this place.
My son is here.

367
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,429
I will… I will look for a place to hide.

368
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,431
Give me my grandson.

369
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:13,391
Wait… Wait a second.

370
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,228
I said give me my grandson.

371
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,287
Be careful.

372
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:57,936
I think it's better if we leave together.

373
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,188
Yes, it's better that way.

374
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,523
- Mother,
- Let's go.

375
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:04,109
Where are you going?

376
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,652
Why are you leaving?

377
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:16,288
It's okay…

378
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,790
I was planning to come back for you.

379
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,376
Let's go to the library.

380
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,461
- I have secured the…
- No.

381
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,673
Let's go to the basement.

382
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:29,801
It's safer there.

383
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:30,760
Not there.

384
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:33,013
And why not, Amando?

385
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,016
I haven't checked it.

386
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,767
Maybe Ando is there.

387
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,520
And how are we sure
that he's not in the library?

388
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,273
How would we know if this is a trap?

389
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,942
You will lead us there.

390
00:24:46,026 --> 00:24:51,198
Ando is there
and the two of you will ambush us.

391
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,574
No.

392
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,076
We will go with Jericho.

393
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,079
Jericho, let's go.

394
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,456
Let's go.

395
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,671
Be careful.

396
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:14,137
Mother…

397
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:17,557
Be careful, the baby.

398
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,144
Let's go to the library…

399
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:23,647
Let's go there.

400
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:25,523
Aurora?

401
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:28,151
Sam, Mercy…

402
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,445
it's safer in the library. Believe me.

403
00:25:31,947 --> 00:25:33,740
Ando.

404
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,410
Ando.

405
00:25:38,411 --> 00:25:39,454
Oh, my God.

406
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,790
Jericho.

407
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,625
Mother.

408
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:46,586
Ando is dead.

409
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,546
What?

410
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,340
Ando is dead?

411
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,842
<i>Yes, George. He was stabbed.</i>

412
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,678
Sir Amando is looking at us.

413
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:56,596
He killed Ando.

414
00:25:57,305 --> 00:26:00,558
And now he wants all of us
to go to the library

415
00:26:00,642 --> 00:26:01,851
so he can kill us all there.

416
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,813
That animal.

417
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,648
He's the traitor of the family.

418
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,650
He will pay. He's an animal.

419
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,818
Dad, no.

420
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:11,987
You can't go there. I won't let you.

421
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,822
I won't let you die.

422
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:18,326
Sam… Sam, where are we going?

423
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,454
Sam, let's go to the basement.

424
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,747
That's the safest place,

425
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,916
Let's go to my room.

426
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,169
That's the strongest part of the house.

427
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:31,256
<i>It's bulletproof like a fortress.</i>
<i>Come on, follow me.</i>

428
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:36,177
You'll both be trapped in that place
if there's an emergency.

429
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,348
Let's go to the library.
There are a lot of exit points if needed.

430
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,725
Stop it, Amando.

431
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,184
<i>Don't fool us anymore.</i>

432
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:46,354
You want to take us there
so you can kill all of us.

433
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,899
What Aurora? I didn't kill Ando.

434
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,901
And I won't put any of you in danger,

435
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,903
especially

436
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:55,989
Paco's son.

437
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,033
I know you know that, Aurora.

438
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,660
Stop it. You talk too much.

439
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,579
Come on, let's go. Follow me.

440
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:03,538
Come on.

441
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,165
<i>Really Aurora,</i>

442
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,042
while your lives are in danger,

443
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:09,711
you even manage to argue with Amando?

444
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,004
That's it.

445
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,173
Let's go to the family room.
Let's go, Mother. Let's go.

446
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,717
What foolishness is this Sam?

447
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:19,471
Don't contradict
what I'm saying. Let's go.

448
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:23,391
Go wherever you want to go,
but we will go to the family room.

449
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:24,559
- Let's go, Mother.
- Fine.

450
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,354
I will go where my grandson is

451
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,147
<i>so that if there's a problem,</i>

452
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,107
<i>I will be there to protect him.</i>

453
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,360
Let's go. Come on.

454
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:37,113
If you really want to go there, okay.

455
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,283
I'll go with you to make sure
that you're okay.

456
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:43,161
Is it still safe for Amando
to be with them?

457
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,080
Isn't it too risky?

458
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:49,709
Jericho, keep a close eye on Amando.

459
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:52,128
<i>He might be planning something bad.</i>

460
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,675
- Jericho, let's go down.
- Let's go.

461
00:27:58,426 --> 00:27:59,511
Let's go down.

462
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:09,270
Why do you have a knife?

463
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:13,775
It was you who stabbed Ando.

464
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:15,402
No,

465
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:18,363
I have nothing to do
with the killings here.

466
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:22,742
What are you waiting for?
Let's go. Follow me.

467
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,995
Stop accusing me Aurora.

468
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,331
The only reason I have a knife is
so I have protection

469
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,043
<i>for myself against the killer.</i>

470
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,463
For your protection.

471
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:37,590
I will protect you.

472
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,138
If I had killed the killer…

473
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:44,973
Mercy…

474
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,474
this should have blood.

475
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,892
- Here…
- Sam…

476
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,561
But, there's nothing.

477
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:52,063
- Sam…
- You could've cleaned that.

478
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:55,233
Get away from him. Get away.

479
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,119
<i>Jericho!</i>

480
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:11,708
- Mother. Mother.
- Don't … Ah.

481
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,462
Sam, what's going on over there?

482
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:18,131
Samantha, answer me.

483
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,967
- Enough. Enough. Enough.
- Stop. Jericho. Stop.

484
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,218
Stop it.

485
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,596
- Stop it.
- Jericho.

486
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:26,598
Don't you meddle with us.

487
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,516
Rico, take care of your bosses.

488
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,561
<i>- Amando, stop it.</i>
<i>- Let them go.</i>

489
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:34,022
Rico, keep an eye on them…

490
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,857
because I will protect them
from the killer.

491
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,734
Stop it.

492
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,278
- Jericho, stop it.
- That's enough.

493
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,238
That's enough.

494
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,283
Give me the baby.

495
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,121
Jericho and Amando are beating each other.

496
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,790
- Oh, my God.
- Stop it.

497
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:55,627
Ma'am Aurora give me back my grandson.

498
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,629
The baby.

499
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,340
My baby. My baby.

500
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:04,552
Did Aurora take the baby?

501
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,471
Yes, Mom.

502
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:10,767
Auntie Aurora added to their problems
in the other house.

503
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:11,851
George…

504
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,939
Sam might need help.

505
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:16,981
The baby.

506
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,617
Bill.

507
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,662
Go to the other house.

508
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,121
Take this.

509
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,748
Use this.

510
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,583
What about you, sir?

511
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,752
Cairo and I will take care of things here.

512
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:42,006
Don't forsake your Ma'am Aurora
and our grandson too.

513
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,591
Hurry.

514
00:30:44,384 --> 00:30:45,844
And Samantha too.

515
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:49,472
Make sure nothing bad happens
to her and Auntie Mercy.

516
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:52,183
- Go now.
- Please, Bill.

517
00:30:52,934 --> 00:30:54,561
Cairo, close the door.

518
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,157
Aurora… you animal.
Give me back my grandson.

519
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:10,243
Aurora, where are you?

520
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:12,161
Aurora, where's the baby?

521
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:20,753
My grandson is so cute and so behaved.

522
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,673
I will never return you to them.

523
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:25,884
You're all mine.

524
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,928
And don't worry. With me,

525
00:31:29,012 --> 00:31:32,432
my dear grandson, you are always safe.

526
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,058
Okay?

527
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:36,477
Where are you, Aurora?

528
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:37,770
Aurora.

529
00:31:37,854 --> 00:31:39,689
Give me back my grandson.

530
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,190
You have no right…

531
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:46,863
Look…

532
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,452
Look…

533
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:56,915
to take away Sam's son.

534
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,291
Aurora…

535
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,876
Aurora, give me back my grandson.

536
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,961
If something happens to my grandson
I won't stop bothering you.

537
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:03,755
I will kill you. I will do it.

538
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:16,643
Tell me why I shouldn't kill you, Jericho.

539
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,525
Where's Amando?

540
00:32:25,401 --> 00:32:27,320
Auntie, he followed you and Sam.

541
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,947
I still haven't seen him.

542
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:33,284
I am sure that
Sam is worried about her baby.

543
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,912
Return her baby to her.

544
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,538
No.

545
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,582
Don't come near me.

546
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:41,167
Auntie Aurora.

547
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:46,673
How would I know
if you and Amando are in connivance?

548
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,384
And your fight earlier was just a show.

549
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,136
Right?

550
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:56,224
Didn't Amando hire you to work for us?

551
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:58,476
Auntie, that's not true.

552
00:32:58,977 --> 00:33:02,355
Sergeant Royales verified my identity.

553
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,982
I am a Palacios.

554
00:33:04,482 --> 00:33:06,234
I am you brother's son.

555
00:33:08,444 --> 00:33:10,863
You know what you're doing
is wrong, Auntie.

556
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:15,451
So, please… put down your gun…

557
00:33:15,952 --> 00:33:18,121
and give me Sam's baby.

558
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:20,832
Think about it.

559
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,293
How about you? Would you agree
if they took Sir Paco from you

560
00:33:24,377 --> 00:33:26,254
while he was still young?

561
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:32,510
You're right, Jericho.

562
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,514
I wasn't thinking straight.

563
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:41,060
I shouldn't have taken him from Sam.

564
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,482
Here, take him.

565
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,663
You fool.

566
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:06,002
No one can take Paco's son away from me.

567
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,089
Come on, baby.

568
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:22,935
Who are you?

569
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,314
Whoever you are, I am not scared of you.

570
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,318
Who are you?

571
00:34:36,866 --> 00:34:38,159
Aurora, you animal.

572
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:39,952
Where are you? Give me back my grandson.

573
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,580
Aurora. Where are you?

574
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:43,915
Aurora.

575
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,751
Jericho?

576
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,629
Jericho. Oh, my God.

577
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,798
My God, Jericho.

578
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,674
Wake up, Jericho.

579
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,404
Ms. Mercy. It's me. It's me.

580
00:35:15,488 --> 00:35:17,281
- Rico…
- Jericho.

581
00:35:17,865 --> 00:35:20,243
Have you seen Aurora and my grandson?

582
00:35:20,326 --> 00:35:23,579
No… Jericho… Did Sir Amando kill him?

583
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:27,250
He's still alive, but you take care
of him. I will look for Aurora.

584
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:28,918
Aurora?

585
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,086
Jericho…

586
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,797
Jericho, wake up.

587
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,413
I will keep you safe, my grandson.

588
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,956
We're leaving this place.

589
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:11,961
We will live in peace together,
my little Paco.

590
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,964
Aurora, you animal.

591
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,841
Give me back my grandson.

592
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,259
No, Mercy.

593
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:22,180
I will save this baby
from the Palacios killer.

594
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:25,016
Sam and I will save him, not you.

595
00:36:32,148 --> 00:36:33,191
Go ahead.

596
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:37,695
Try Mercy and I swear to God
I will drop this baby.

597
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,781
Are you really that evil
that you will kill your own blood

598
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,700
just to take him away from Sam?

599
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,912
I have no plans of killing my grandson.

600
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:49,707
But, I can't accept
that he will not grow up with me.

601
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:52,168
So, I'd rather send him in heaven

602
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,629
than let him live with your daughter,

603
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:57,757
so we won't be fighting over something.

604
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,509
It's you who should go to hell.

605
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:19,987
Sam? What's happening there?

606
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,658
<i>I can't find Mommy Aurora and Mother.</i>

607
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:24,742
My God.

608
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,870
Please find Auntie Aurora
and get our son back.

609
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:28,913
<i>I will.</i>

610
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:30,915
Wait.

611
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:34,919
Maybe Amando can hear
our conversations over the radio.

612
00:37:35,002 --> 00:37:37,755
He might trace you. He might kill you.

613
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:42,551
Just turn off the radio.
Just get back to me once you find our son.

614
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,555
Sam, be careful with Amando.

615
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:48,808
Bill is on his way there.
Just wait for him.

616
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,396
You?

617
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,231
You're the Palacios killer.

618
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,453
Where did the shots come from?

619
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:39,442
Sam, what's happening there?
We heard some gunshots.

620
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,611
Oh, my God.
I asked Sam to turn off the radio.

621
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:44,905
How will we know
what's happening at the other house?

622
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,240
Damn it.

623
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,284
Maybe Amando killed someone again.

624
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,244
He doesn't have a gun.

625
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,662
All he has is a knife.

626
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:54,498
Bill…

627
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,293
Maybe, the shot we heard is from his gun.

628
00:38:57,793 --> 00:38:59,587
Maybe he finally caught Sir Amando.

629
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:01,005
I hope so.

630
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:04,675
I hope he was able
to shoot that animal, Amando.

631
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,678
Oh, my God. No.

632
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:09,638
- Oh, my God.
- Why George?

633
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:12,058
That's Bill.

634
00:39:12,141 --> 00:39:14,185
The Palacios murderer killed Bill.

635
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,229
Amando killed him.

636
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,468
Dad, is what Amando said true?

637
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,762
That he and Auntie Aurora
had a relationship before.

638
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,098
Something happened between them before.

639
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:55,393
If that's the case, he is Paco's father.

640
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,561
Sam's baby is his grandson.

641
00:39:59,021 --> 00:40:00,940
Dad, what are you doing?

642
00:40:01,023 --> 00:40:03,484
I don't want to be carried away
by my fear of that Amando.

643
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:07,238
I need to force him
to stop his threats to our family,

644
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,574
and also for me to seek revenge
for poisoning Basil.

645
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:14,662
But, how sure are you
that Amando poisoned Basil?

646
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,373
Because Paco and Basil are enemies.

647
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:19,458
And maybe that's why he thought

648
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:21,877
it was Basil who pushed Paco.

649
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,297
That's why he is seeking revenge.
He is seeking revenge on us all.

650
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:30,010
Dad, I also want Amando to pay if he is
really the one who killed my husband.

651
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,305
But, what you're thinking is dangerous.

652
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:35,307
Yes, Sir Galvan. The kids are right.

653
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:39,186
How can you be so sure
that Amando is moving all by himself,

654
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:41,230
and that he doesn't have an accomplice?

655
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,648
Mother?

656
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:44,275
Mother…

657
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:45,693
Mother?

658
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:48,988
Mother, what happened to you? Mother…

659
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:51,657
Why does the case seem rushed?

660
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:55,536
Because my superior meddled with the case.

661
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:57,163
Did you rig the case?

662
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,790
If you want to reopen the case,

663
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:02,710
here are the answers to your question.

664
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,670
Who overdosed him?

665
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:06,881
Amando Namas?

666
