1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>All the kindness you showed me</i>

2
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:54,471
<i>was a lie!</i>

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:56,598
Going with me to the hospital…

4
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:58,600
Even calling me "my child"…

5
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:01,436
<i>You did all of that to earn my trust</i>

6
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,812
<i>so I can be comfortable,</i>

7
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,981
<i>so you can betray me!</i>

8
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,734
<i>But that was before, Sam!</i>

9
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,944
All he talks about is Jerico.

10
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,031
<i>He doesn't care about Peter's death.</i>

11
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,574
Why waste time on Peter?

12
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:18,036
<i>He's a thief, and he's not</i>
<i>even their relative.</i>

13
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,789
He worked for our bosses
for several years.

14
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:23,500
The least they could have done
was see that justice was done for him.

15
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,293
<i>This is Jerico's room.</i>

16
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:28,129
<i>Ever since Peter died,</i>
<i>he's been the only one using this.</i>

17
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:29,297
<i>Thank you, Ms. Georgina.</i>

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,051
<i>Peter's murder case will be solved swiftly</i>
<i>because of your cooperation.</i>

19
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,302
<i>Sergeant Royales, look.</i>

20
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:37,472
Didn't you say that
the possible murder weapon

21
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:38,681
used to kill Peter

22
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,391
was either a pipe or a baseball bat?

23
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:42,936
<i>Jerico, who owns this house?</i>

24
00:01:43,019 --> 00:01:44,312
<i>It's Papa's.</i>

25
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,980
Papa was still a bachelor
when he had this built.

26
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:48,024
That may be the reason why you don't know.

27
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:53,071
<i>Who knows what memories</i>
<i>of Papa we can find here?</i>

28
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:56,282
PREVIOUSLY

29
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,162
<i>Can I also check the cabinet?</i>

30
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,872
<i>Yes, of course, Sergeant Royales.</i>

31
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,668
Jerico is the killer?

32
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:10,338
<i>They found a picture of Sir Basil</i>
<i>in Jerico's cabinet.</i>

33
00:02:10,421 --> 00:02:12,298
Jerico is Basil's killer?

34
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,425
And maybe Sir Paco's killer too.

35
00:02:14,509 --> 00:02:17,303
They also saw a picture of Sir Paco
marked with an X.

36
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:20,348
Maybe he had something to do
with Sir Paco falling off the cliff.

37
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:23,601
So it's confirmed? He's really the killer?

38
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,978
It's too early to assume.

39
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,438
But we found this baseball bat
with blood on it.

40
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:30,859
And, sir, we also found this
in the cabinet belonging to Mr. Palacios.

41
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,361
<i>Black hoodie and black gloves!</i>

42
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,864
Remember what Sofia told us?

43
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:37,740
That's what Beverly's killer was wearing.

44
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:40,577
<i>And we also found this</i>
<i>in your nephew's bag.</i>

45
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,247
That's the same type of morphine tablet
that was used to poison your son.

46
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,874
Let's go home.

47
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,208
Hold on.

48
00:02:47,292 --> 00:02:49,043
I'm not in the mood anymore.

49
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,295
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,463
Let's just go back to the estate.

51
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,843
Sam.

52
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,390
Once they catch that Jerico,
I'll have him jailed.

53
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:04,100
I might even have him killed!

54
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,227
Ma…

55
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:07,770
What?

56
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:10,732
He killed my son, Sam! Your husband!

57
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:14,569
If I could kill him
a million times, I would.

58
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:19,449
That is the punishment he deserves
for taking Paco's life.

59
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,459
Maybe you're getting stressed, Sam.

60
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:30,835
You should rest now.

61
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:35,423
And the next time Galvan
confronts you and screams at you,

62
00:03:35,506 --> 00:03:36,716
just let me know.

63
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,468
I'll take care of him.

64
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:40,970
No need.

65
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,223
I can take care of myself.

66
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:47,143
I don't need somebody else to defend me.

67
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:52,815
Sam…

68
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,777
Are you still mad at me?

69
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:00,865
No.

70
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:03,785
Because the truth is,

71
00:04:03,868 --> 00:04:06,120
it's good that I found out
about your real plan.

72
00:04:06,829 --> 00:04:10,583
That way, I know who my enemy is.

73
00:04:12,293 --> 00:04:16,172
We are not enemies, Sam, my child.

74
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,842
I hope not.

75
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:24,931
Because, Ma, I may look timid,

76
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:27,642
but I can fight back,

77
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:30,937
especially if it's for my child.

78
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:32,981
I know.

79
00:04:33,856 --> 00:04:35,984
And I also want you to know

80
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:39,612
that we'll both fight for your child.

81
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:42,699
For my grandchild.

82
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:46,619
Sam.

83
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:48,079
Sam!

84
00:04:48,162 --> 00:04:49,205
Sam!

85
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,707
Samantha!

86
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:54,961
Ma'am Aurora.

87
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:57,463
This is all your fault, Amando.

88
00:04:57,547 --> 00:05:00,174
Because you talked too much to Galvan,

89
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,759
look at what's happening now!

90
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:03,803
Sam is mad at me!

91
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:07,181
Let's think about that later, madam.

92
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,684
We have a bigger problem. It's Rebecca.

93
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,353
I thought

94
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,065
that Loray was going to
watch over Rebecca.

95
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,526
That's why we replaced Angie.

96
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,572
Rebecca is with Jerico right now.

97
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,699
What?

98
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,368
Something might happen to her.

99
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,412
Jerico might kill her, madam.

100
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,831
Oh my God.

101
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,472
Jerico…

102
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,100
Jerico, why are you being like this?

103
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,393
Why are you looking at me that way?

104
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:54,729
- Just stay there.
- What?

105
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:55,772
Don't move.

106
00:05:55,855 --> 00:05:57,190
Why?

107
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,233
No!

108
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:09,118
Jerico!

109
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,538
Thank you, Attorney.

110
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:18,377
Mother, the attorney just needs to wait
for the final SOCO report.

111
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:22,715
If they can prove that it was Jerico
who killed Basil…

112
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,884
Francis will be free?

113
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,427
Yes.

114
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,388
But is Jerico really the killer?

115
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:34,477
Because they said that he might have been
involved in Paco's fall.

116
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,856
We know the truth about that.

117
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,362
You don't believe me?

118
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:46,155
I'll show you! I'm doing this!

119
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:47,949
I will jump and I'll take you with me!

120
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:50,785
- Come on!
- Let go of me!

121
00:06:57,625 --> 00:06:58,626
I don't know.

122
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,758
The pictures they found
could mean a lot of things.

123
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,054
It could possibly just be a list of the
Palacios family members who have died,

124
00:07:10,888 --> 00:07:17,228
and Paco's death could have
nothing to do with Basil's death.

125
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:22,316
What's important is that we can prove
it was Jerico who killed Basil,

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,403
so my brother can be freed from prison.

127
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,076
Sam.

128
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:33,661
Sam!

129
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:37,081
Did you frame up Jerico?

130
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,835
What? Why would I do that?

131
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,963
So your criminal brother can be free.

132
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:47,508
That's what George always accuses you of.

133
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:50,386
That you may be involved
in all of these killings

134
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:54,682
so we will forget that it was
Francis who killed Basil!

135
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,684
Galvan?

136
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:01,689
What's going on here?

137
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:03,274
It's your daughter-in-law.

138
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,696
She planted Francis' morphine
in Jerico's things

139
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,075
so we'd think that Jerico was the suspect
and not her brother.

140
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,161
My brother is innocent.

141
00:08:15,244 --> 00:08:17,163
He had nothing to do with Basil's death.

142
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,917
He was in prison
when Beverly and Peter died,

143
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,128
while Jerico was here and free.

144
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,506
Why do you always accuse my brother?

145
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:31,636
Galvan, why are you always picking on Sam?

146
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:36,933
It was Jerico, whom you are so eager
to introduce as your relative,

147
00:08:37,016 --> 00:08:40,520
who killed your own son,
and my son too.

148
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,648
See? My suspicion was correct.

149
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,943
Galvan, Paco didn't commit suicide.

150
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,444
He was killed!

151
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,197
Jerico killed him.

152
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,115
But why would he do that?

153
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:56,410
He is a relative of Paco and Basil.

154
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:00,873
Why would he kill his cousins
and my grandson?

155
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,334
For money, Galvan.

156
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,004
He knows that he is a Palacios.

157
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:08,631
Once Paco's dead,

158
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:10,258
once Basil's dead,

159
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:12,510
once your grandson is dead,

160
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:16,347
he'll get a huge inheritance!

161
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,849
He's out to kill everyone

162
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,645
who would share our family's wealth.

163
00:09:58,347 --> 00:09:59,473
Gosh.

164
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,642
Thank you so much, Jerico.

165
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:03,019
You saved me.

166
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,855
I really thought you were
going to stab me.

167
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,859
Why would I do that? We're siblings.

168
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,652
I don't know.

169
00:10:11,736 --> 00:10:18,075
Maybe you found me annoying because
I suddenly wanted to go home.

170
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:21,037
Don't you want to stay here?

171
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,873
I thought we'd find memories of Papa.

172
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:26,375
Yes, but…

173
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,465
I remember Tonyo.

174
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:36,093
Tonyo, your ex?

175
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:42,475
Ever since I lost him, I lost my balance.

176
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,310
What did he die of?

177
00:10:45,186 --> 00:10:48,105
He was in an accident in the mines.

178
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:50,524
Let me guess.

179
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:52,109
They didn't recover his body.

180
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,694
How did you know?

181
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,156
That's what they also said about Papa.

182
00:10:57,239 --> 00:10:58,658
His boat sunk,

183
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:00,117
and they failed to recover his body.

184
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,329
A lot of accidents
have happened in this family.

185
00:11:04,121 --> 00:11:07,750
That's why sometimes it makes you wonder

186
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,086
if it was really an accident,

187
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,921
or if they were just making it
look like an accident.

188
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:19,428
So you're saying that
you have a conspiracy theory

189
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,263
about Papa's death and Tonyo's?

190
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,140
Not only theirs.

191
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:24,975
Basil's too.

192
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,853
How about you?
Do you think Francis killed Basil?

193
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,856
Well, the evidence points to him,

194
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,901
but as for the motive…

195
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,862
I'm not convinced.

196
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,031
What about Beverly and her son?

197
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,700
Even now,
it's still a mystery who killed her.

198
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:43,494
So what are you trying to say?

199
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:46,163
That the Palacios family is messed up.

200
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,290
Our family.

201
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,879
The people we are with
are hiding a lot of things.

202
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,261
Sorry, Auntie Aurora is calling.

203
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:02,555
Hello, Auntie?

204
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,515
Rebecca, I've been trying to call you.

205
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:06,392
Auntie, yes, I'm sorry.

206
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,353
Papa's old house has no signal.

207
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,021
Are you still with that man?

208
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:14,442
Yeah. I'm actually with him right now.

209
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,443
Why?

210
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:16,944
<i>Rebecca.</i>

211
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,530
Listen to me, and listen to me well.

212
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,325
I know you really trust
your illegitimate brother.

213
00:12:24,285 --> 00:12:26,328
But you need to trust me.

214
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,788
Run away from him

215
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,790
<i>and don't be too obvious.</i>

216
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,169
Get away from him as far as you can.

217
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,718
Attorney, how soon can you come here?

218
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:44,346
I need your legal advice
concerning the murder of Basil.

219
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,811
All right, thank you.

220
00:13:10,831 --> 00:13:11,957
Thank you.

221
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,008
Hon…

222
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:25,054
don't blame yourself too much.

223
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,516
Jerico fooled all of us.

224
00:13:28,599 --> 00:13:30,809
He was able to make us trust him.

225
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:35,105
We thought he was someone kind,

226
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:37,900
but it turns out he's a snake

227
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,737
who'll suddenly appear here
and bite all of us.

228
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,158
But for what it's worth,

229
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,245
at least now
you can make sure justice is done

230
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:53,040
for what happened to Basil
and your grandson.

231
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,087
He will pay for what he did to Basil.

232
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,227
Don't worry, hon.

233
00:14:14,853 --> 00:14:16,647
Whatever happens,

234
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,650
I am here for you…

235
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:23,237
and so is your daughter.

236
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:29,994
All your plans for Basil…

237
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:33,497
and then for Jerico…

238
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:40,713
All of those can still be fulfilled
and come true.

239
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:44,550
Only this time…

240
00:14:47,094 --> 00:14:50,764
through your daughter, Sofia.

241
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,327
Auntie?

242
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,703
<i>He killed Peter.</i>

243
00:15:12,786 --> 00:15:16,081
He was also the one
who killed Beverly and her son.

244
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,124
And even Basil.

245
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:19,293
He was the one who pushed Paco.

246
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:22,504
He is the Palacios killer, Rebecca.

247
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,155
Auntie Aurora must be worried about you.

248
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:50,532
Actually, she's really worried.

249
00:15:51,909 --> 00:15:54,912
You should have told her that you
were safe because I'm with you.

250
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,831
That's why she's worried.

251
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,124
Because I'm with you.

252
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:05,339
I am with the person who's been killing
the Palacios family.

253
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,424
What?

254
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,934
Ma'am Aurora's order is to do
everything possible to save Rebecca.

255
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:21,897
No more members of the Palacios family
are to be hurt by that killer.

256
00:16:21,981 --> 00:16:23,774
Men, let's go!

257
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:24,984
Wait.

258
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,736
I'll go with you.

259
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:41,792
Wait, hold on. So Jerico is now the one
who's been killing in the estate?

260
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:47,965
It's so confusing.

261
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:52,386
I understand his hatred towards Peter
because he stole his identity.

262
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,514
But what about the other murders?

263
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,684
Basil!

264
00:16:58,767 --> 00:17:00,477
That's enough, sir!

265
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,814
You jark! Here, let's see
if you can avoid this.

266
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:06,316
What now?

267
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,404
I have a guess about Sir Basil's case.

268
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,489
He pointed a gun at Jerico before.

269
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,284
He could've held a grudge.

270
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:18,871
Maybe he couldn't forgive someone
who oppressed him.

271
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:23,500
There are people like that, right?
They don't easily forget things.

272
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:29,882
If they get insulted or hurt,
that type of person

273
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,927
will forever remember it.

274
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:37,097
And they won't be at peace
until they seek revenge.

275
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,517
That's so confusing.

276
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,276
Tell me.

277
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,487
Tell me the truth!

278
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,782
Are you the one who has been killing
the Palacios family?

279
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,327
- What?
- Don't come near me!

280
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:00,704
Don't come near me.

281
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,082
Don't come near me.

282
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,295
Are my intuitions off?

283
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,799
Because I…

284
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,093
for me…

285
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:16,720
I see a positive aura in you.

286
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,099
But why is Auntie Aurora
telling me differently?

287
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,017
Rebecca, look at me!

288
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,936
Look at my aura!

289
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:27,022
Did something change there?
Did it become negative?

290
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,441
Then why are they telling me
that you're the killer?

291
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:34,071
They told me that it was you
who killed Peter, Beverly,

292
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:36,490
and even Paco and Basil.

293
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,284
Paco had an accident!
He fell off the cliff.

294
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,662
Did he fall? Or did you push him?

295
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:46,667
The other murder weapons
were found in with your things.

296
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,836
What murder weapon?

297
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,295
I have no idea. I don't know!

298
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:51,964
I don't know either!

299
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:55,467
I thought I could trust you.

300
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,556
I thought that finally,

301
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,100
I had found my ally,

302
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,769
my sibling.

303
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:12,693
So is this why you brought me here?

304
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,695
Is this why you invited me here?

305
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:18,198
Because you will kill me next,
after Peter?

306
00:19:18,282 --> 00:19:19,867
Is that it?

307
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,493
Is that your plan?

308
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,706
I've been longing for a family
for a long time.

309
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:29,835
Mama died early.

310
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:31,712
Papa didn't come back for me.

311
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:35,549
Now that I've found you
and learned that you are my sister,

312
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,385
do you think I would hurt you?

313
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:43,348
If I was going to kill you, Rebecca,

314
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,726
I would've let the snake bite you.

315
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,147
But I saved you, right?

316
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:53,901
Rebecca…

317
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,655
everything that I am showing you…

318
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,158
is real.

319
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,495
So please…

320
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,373
Please trust me.

321
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,753
It's still me,

322
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,714
your elder brother, Jerico.

323
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,106
I'm sorry.

324
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,086
Is that the police?

325
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:56,588
Did you know that the police
were on their way here?

326
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:58,507
Jerico…

327
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:00,133
Jerico, if you're innocent,

328
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:02,261
it will be easy to clear your name.

329
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,929
We'll just say that you were framed

330
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,807
and that someone planted the pieces
of evidence in your things.

331
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,268
Rebecca, when we showed them
the DNA results

332
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:10,769
proving that I was a Palacios,

333
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,439
did they believe us right away?

334
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:17,234
Did they accept me right away?

335
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,569
No, right?

336
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,532
Because they see me as a scammer.

337
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,825
A piece of garbage!

338
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,660
No, no, no.

339
00:21:26,743 --> 00:21:28,704
We will look for a good lawyer.

340
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:32,791
We will clear your name
and we will find the real suspect.

341
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:35,377
My intuition's never failed me, Jerico.
Come on, listen to me.

342
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,006
You're a good soul, you're a good soul.
We will prove that to everybody!

343
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:42,092
I hope he gets caught, that fool!

344
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,429
Everybody thought I killed Beverly

345
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,889
when it turns out that
he's the real killer?!

346
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,975
If he's the one.

347
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,353
What are you trying to say?

348
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:58,233
You were with me in Jerico's room
and you saw the evidence.

349
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:01,320
I'm not supposed to share
my theories with anyone.

350
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:05,449
I am the wife of one of his victims.
I want to know everything.

351
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:07,743
I need to know everything!

352
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,995
Rebecca, you don't understand

353
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:13,123
because you grew up a Palacios
just like them!

354
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,459
While me,

355
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:17,377
I only have the Palacios blood.

356
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,257
Rebecca, they look down on me.

357
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,384
They will not believe me!

358
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:27,804
Especially now

359
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:30,807
that they're looking at me as a suspect
and saying I killed Basil.

360
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,978
What do you think

361
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,272
the family will do?

362
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,902
Accept the illegitimate child

363
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:44,613
or jail the person who killed Basil?

364
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,579
It feels like something's wrong.

365
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,123
The actions of the suspect
were always so clean.

366
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,500
And so?

367
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,003
All of a sudden, all the evidence
is found in Jerico's room?

368
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:02,756
In his room where others can see it?

369
00:23:03,715 --> 00:23:06,426
Serial killers are like that.

370
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:11,473
They collect their victims' things
just like trophies.

371
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,558
I find it too clumsy.

372
00:23:13,642 --> 00:23:16,103
So what are you trying to say?

373
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,147
That someone planted that
in Jerico's room?

374
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:21,441
Who?

375
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,068
Who would do that?

376
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:27,489
Was it Sam?

377
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,164
<i>Did do you something bad to Jerico?</i>

378
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:39,751
<i>Does he have a reason to try and kill you?</i>

379
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:51,763
<i>They said he had something</i>
<i>to do with your death,</i>

380
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:54,599
<i>and we both know that's not true.</i>

381
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:23,461
<i>But if they think that it was Jerico</i>
<i>who killed you,</i>

382
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,882
<i>maybe that's better.</i>

383
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,274
Jerico Palacios!

384
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:46,151
Don't!

385
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,779
Release Ms. Rebecca Palacios
and come with us!

386
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,157
Rebecca.

387
00:24:58,663 --> 00:24:59,915
Ma'am?

388
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,250
Here's the wine you asked me to buy.

389
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,336
It's Sir Galvan's favorite.

390
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,769
I added some more.

391
00:25:25,565 --> 00:25:28,902
It looks like they will arrest Jerico now.

392
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,862
I will celebrate later

393
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,990
once he's really behind bars.

394
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:36,076
Please, please, put down your guns.

395
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:38,370
There's no need for violence.

396
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:41,289
Rebecca, what are you doing there?

397
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,332
Come here!

398
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:43,750
Come here!

399
00:25:43,833 --> 00:25:45,877
No, Uncle!

400
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,338
Jerico is not a bad person.

401
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,548
Someone just planted the pieces
of evidence in his things.

402
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,384
He's not the real suspect.

403
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:55,470
If that's the case, he should come with us
to the police station.

404
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:56,805
He should explain himself there.

405
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:58,515
Once Jerico is gone,

406
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:02,102
there will only be three new-generation
members of the Palacios family left.

407
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,354
Ma'am Rebecca,

408
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,898
Ms. Sam's baby,

409
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,900
and Sofia.

410
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,569
One with a mental illness,

411
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,613
and one that hasn't been born yet.

412
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,575
How can they compare with my daughter?

413
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,499
Ma'am, I'll get going.

414
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,469
Jerico, surrender, please.

415
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,930
Don't worry, I won't forsake you.
I promise.

416
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,266
I don't want to.
I'll just be like Francis.

417
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:42,976
I'll rot in jail.

418
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:45,061
Go ahead and arrest that man!

419
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,521
Put your hands up!

420
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:48,106
I will not surrender!

421
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,776
Jerico!

422
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:53,862
Jerico!

423
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:55,613
Sorry, Rebecca. I will not hurt you.

424
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:57,907
I just have to do this.
I don't want to go to jail.

425
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,578
Put down your guns.

426
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,204
Put them down.

427
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,125
Damn you, Jerico!

428
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,794
We took you under our wing!

429
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,213
We fed you, gave you a roof,

430
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,549
and accepted you as a relative.

431
00:27:14,632 --> 00:27:16,259
Is this how you repay us?

432
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:17,594
Repay me?!

433
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,013
Why did you kill Basil?

434
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,681
Sir, I'm innocent!

435
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,183
I didn't kill him!

436
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,560
You were not content with Basil!

437
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:27,896
You even involved my grandson!

438
00:27:27,979 --> 00:27:30,398
That baby was my salvation.

439
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,359
My vindication.

440
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:35,070
You did not just kill my grandson,

441
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,572
you killed my legacy!

442
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,407
You should've killed me instead.

443
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,576
Sir, believe me.

444
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,744
My conscience is clear!

445
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,287
I didn't kill any of them!

446
00:27:44,371 --> 00:27:46,331
You will pay for this.

447
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:49,084
You will rot in jail until you die!

448
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,837
- Don't!
- Go ahead!

449
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,636
Don't!

450
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,888
Uncle Galvan, please listen to Jerico.

451
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,140
He didn't kill Basil!

452
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,350
No, Rebecca!

453
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:07,352
He's already brainwashed you!

454
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,562
That guy is a killer.

455
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,231
He killed Basil!

456
00:28:11,314 --> 00:28:14,734
But I won't let him hurt another Palacios.

457
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:17,195
Jerico, go ahead and escape.

458
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:20,407
I will convince them that you're innocent.

459
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,033
Please.

460
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,410
Don't go near us!

461
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:26,704
Don't come near. I will kill her!

462
00:28:27,414 --> 00:28:29,541
Don't come near us!

463
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,251
I will kill her!

464
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,798
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- No! No!

465
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,925
- Rebecca, let go of me!
- No!

466
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:40,593
Rebecca?

467
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:42,429
Did you get hurt?

468
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:44,681
No.

469
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:32,061
I still can't believe
that Jerico is the killer.

470
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:36,149
What about you guys?
Did you suspect that it was him?

471
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:39,736
In mystery novels,
the suspects are always a surprise,

472
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:43,490
and the least obvious person
turns out to be the killer.

473
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:47,744
There you go again, Mr. Mystery Novels.

474
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,580
What you read is different from
what's happening here, bro.

475
00:29:51,581 --> 00:29:54,375
Jeff, is it possible?

476
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,587
That the person everybody thinks is guilty
turns out to be innocent?

477
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,141
<i>We took you under our wing!</i>

478
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,936
We fed you, gave you a roof,

479
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,104
and accepted you as a relative.

480
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:16,856
Is this how you repay us?

481
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,107
Repay me?!

482
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:20,652
Why did you kill Basil?

483
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:27,826
Animals!

484
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,287
You're a bunch of animals!

485
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,040
That guy is a killer.

486
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:37,836
But I won't let him hurt another Palacios.

487
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,547
You're so bad!

488
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,884
You're so, so bad!

489
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,351
Don't tell me you're Team Jerico now?

490
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:56,855
He's still the one who killed Basil,
your half-brother!

491
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,483
But of all the relatives that I have,
Jerico is the kindest.

492
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,404
In fact, he was even more
welcoming than Basil.

493
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,488
Even Daddy.

494
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:10,118
Just because he is friendly to you
doesn't mean he's not a killer.

495
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:11,286
Right, Louie?

496
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,054
Sofia's feelings are valid, Ward.

497
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:32,849
A person is not all black and white.

498
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:36,769
A person can both make a mistake and…

499
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,480
still try to become a better person.

500
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:46,404
Yes. It's been a while
since we last stayed in the house.

501
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:50,158
That's why I want it cleaned first
before we come back.

502
00:31:53,161 --> 00:31:54,412
Thank you.

503
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,127
Are you leaving?

504
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:04,881
I don't know about you two.

505
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:06,424
You're taking each other's side again.

506
00:32:06,507 --> 00:32:08,343
What are you doing here?

507
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:10,136
Go home!

508
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,387
It's not safe yet.

509
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,431
Jerico escaped.

510
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,433
Anything could happen.

511
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:18,061
He might kill someone again.

512
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:20,480
We'll go now. Louie, let's go.

513
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,153
Mom, what will happen to Jerico?

514
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:30,406
He'll be arrested. What else?

515
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:31,824
Well, sorry,

516
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,160
but they saw all the pieces
of evidence against him.

517
00:32:34,827 --> 00:32:40,583
If I were him, I'd rather just die.

518
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:45,421
I was planning to ask you
for permission, but…

519
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,925
since you heard it already,

520
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,345
yes, we're leaving this house.

521
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,889
But they haven't found Jerico.

522
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:59,143
What if he targets you and your baby?

523
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:01,771
All the more reason to leave this place.

524
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:04,983
I don't want to be dragged into
the problems here.

525
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:07,151
And the longer I stay here,

526
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:09,737
the more the safety of my child and my own
will be compromised.

527
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,950
What about my grandchild?
What will happen to him?

528
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,545
Go to your daddy.

529
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:28,047
Give this to him.

530
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:32,385
He is sad. He feels betrayed.

531
00:33:34,137 --> 00:33:37,932
He was betrayed by his protégé.

532
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:42,186
That's why it's the perfect time

533
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:45,898
for you to show him
that you're there for him.

534
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:48,276
His real daughter.

535
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,738
Really, Mommy?

536
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,781
Is that your priority right now?

537
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:56,242
For me to try and get close to Daddy?

538
00:33:56,743 --> 00:34:00,621
Sofia, you don't know
the things I had to do

539
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,915
so we could live in this house.

540
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,208
I won't stop now.

541
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,794
You can still visit us.

542
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:12,383
In my house, where my child
will grow up with me.

543
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:15,470
You will not leave this house, Sam.

544
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:17,180
Or what?

545
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,432
You will hurt me?

546
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,477
You will lock me up?

547
00:34:23,269 --> 00:34:24,645
That's kidnapping.

548
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,647
That's against the law.

549
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,901
And if you harm me,

550
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:32,737
you'll be even less likely to be able
to see your grandchild.

551
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:37,992
You want to bond with your daddy, right?

552
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:41,579
You want to get to know him, right?
You told me so.

553
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:43,623
So this is the perfect time.

554
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,626
Go.

555
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,254
Go.

556
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:56,886
Dad…

557
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:58,554
I brought you some wine.

558
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:01,349
Just put it there.

559
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,233
Is that Dash's replacement?

560
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:14,654
Dash can never be replaced.

561
00:35:16,405 --> 00:35:19,575
They're endemic to South Africa, right?

562
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,618
The macaws.

563
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:26,332
Also, North and Central America,
and the Caribbean.

564
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:29,293
Have you ever been to the Caribbean?

565
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,885
Ten years ago, with Basil.

566
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,266
The was the best overseas trip
I ever took.

567
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,936
The best week of my life.

568
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,400
God, I miss Basil.

569
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:01,492
I hope I can go to the Caribbean
with you someday.

570
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,495
- What the--
- I'm so--

571
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,997
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

572
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:09,250
I'm so sorry, I didn't mean to.

573
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,751
- I'll wipe it.
- You know what?

574
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:11,961
Never mind.

575
00:36:12,628 --> 00:36:14,130
I'll just go change.

576
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:37,904
You think you can take Paco's child
away from me?

577
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,073
You still don't know me, Sam.

578
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:48,456
You have no idea what I can do
to get what I want.

579
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:11,562
She can't take away my grandchild from me!

580
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,482
There's nothing we can do.

581
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,442
That's her right as a mother.

582
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,695
What about me?

583
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,989
How about me, Amando?

584
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:26,452
Don't I have rights over my grandchild
as the grandmother?

585
00:37:26,535 --> 00:37:27,995
Tell me!

586
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,124
Do you want me to make a move?

587
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,671
Let me make up for
what I said to Sir Galvan.

588
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:43,135
You won't touch Sam.

589
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:46,180
She knows how to be tough.

590
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,058
She's fighting back now.

591
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,978
Sam has always been a fighter.

592
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:57,191
She's not like Sir Paco's other girls
who easily gave up.

593
00:37:58,359 --> 00:38:00,403
That's why your son loved her.

594
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,489
He married her and there was
nothing you could do about it.

595
00:38:03,572 --> 00:38:06,617
Don't remind me of that, Amando.

596
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,369
Please!

597
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:12,748
- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- Let me out!

598
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,083
- Ma'am, stay there, please!
- Ma'am!

599
00:38:14,166 --> 00:38:15,793
Ma'am!

600
00:38:17,586 --> 00:38:18,963
Ma'am! Ma'am!

601
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,798
We need to go inside.

602
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:23,175
- No, I don't want to.
- Ma'am, it's not allowed.

603
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,677
And Ma'am Aurora has said

604
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:28,139
that you must stay here
till Jerico is caught.

605
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:30,850
Ma'am, Jerico wants to hurt you.
He will hurt you again.

606
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,103
No, my brother would never hurt me!

607
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:38,274
- Ma'am Aurora will get mad at us.
- Please, let me out.

608
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,608
- Ma'am…
- Let's go, ma'am.

609
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:42,737
- Please, let me out.
- Before Ma'am Aurora arrives.

610
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,030
Auntie! Auntie!

611
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,282
Let go of me! Auntie!

612
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:49,201
Rebecca.

613
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:50,202
Auntie, I don't think…

614
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,163
I don't think Jerico is the killer.

615
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:55,416
The evidence may be pointing at him,
but, Auntie, when I talked to him,

616
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,044
I felt his sincerity.

617
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:02,548
You know me. My intuition
has always been correct.

618
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:04,508
Jerico is a good soul.

619
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:07,094
He would never kill us.

620
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,639
Why are you so fond of poor people,
Rebecca?

621
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,309
First, it was your miner ex-boyfriend,

622
00:39:13,392 --> 00:39:15,478
and now it's Jerico!

623
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:20,107
You always prioritize them
ahead of your own family!

624
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:24,695
We are your family, Rebecca.
You should side with us!

625
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:28,491
Jerico is also our family!
We should help him!

626
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,493
Please, Rebecca!

627
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:36,290
I have a lot of problems to think about,
and you're adding to them!

628
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,376
Bring her inside her room!

629
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,419
No, please don't!

630
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:44,882
Please, if you don't want to go with me,
I will look for my brother alone!

631
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,883
Ma'am!

632
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,219
Auntie…

633
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:55,851
I said,

634
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,228
stop it!

635
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,153
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

636
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:09,698
I didn't mean it. I was just surprised.

637
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:14,412
You've never hurt me before.

638
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:20,042
Rebecca, I'm so stressed right now.

639
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:23,087
It's Sam. She wants to leave this house.

640
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,422
My grandchild will be far away from me.

641
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:27,216
And then there's Jerico and you!

642
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:32,221
- Are you saying that it's my fault?
- No. No.

643
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,306
That's not what I meant, Rebecca.

644
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:39,520
And then you ask me why
I choose to side with those poor people?

645
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,356
Here's your answer!

646
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:46,527
Because you are hurting me!

647
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,699
You also look at me like I'm dirt poor!

648
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:54,452
- Rebecca! Rebecca!
- No!

649
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,912
Rebecca! Rebecca!

650
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:12,219
If you're both still here
by the time I count to three,

651
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,554
you will be fired!

652
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:15,723
One!

653
00:41:58,349 --> 00:41:59,642
I'm sorry

654
00:42:00,476 --> 00:42:02,686
for only visiting you just now.

655
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,457
It's all right, Ma.

656
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,794
You came right on time.

657
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:42,142
Sir Galvan is offering a reward
of five million

658
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,312
to whoever can discover where Jerico is.

659
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,730
<i>You know, the truth is,</i>

660
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,734
I believe that your brother
was just framed.

661
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,735
By who?

662
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:56,365
Well, who benefits now that
your brother is wanted?

663
00:42:56,448 --> 00:43:01,745
I've noticed the way you
and that attorney look at each other.

664
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,832
What's wrong with Inigo and I
becoming close?

665
00:43:04,915 --> 00:43:07,209
He's a man and a lawyer.

666
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,752
He can protect me.

667
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,505
I want to become a better person
for my grandchild.

668
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,091
Sam, Sam…

669
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,426
I'm begging you.

670
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:16,719
Don't leave me.

671
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,596
Don't leave, please.

672
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:21,307
Don't take my grandchild
away from me, please.

673
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,309
NEXT EPISODE

674
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:31,900
<i>Only death can pay for a life.</i>

675
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:36,155
<i>Only death can save Jerico.</i>
