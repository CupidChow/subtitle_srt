1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,142
Look. They were also like that
when Sir Paco died.

2
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,977
<i>The crows are flying around.</i>

3
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,186
<i>Basil is already dead?</i>

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,980
Basil is already dead?

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:25,650
I have a feeling I did something,
but I just can't remember it.

6
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,444
There. That's someone, right?

7
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:29,863
And then there's a wine glass.

8
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:31,406
Isn't that Basil?

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,033
<i>Could this place be cursed?</i>

10
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,368
<i>Our bosses are dying one by one.</i>

11
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:39,372
<i>Are they dying, or are they being killed?</i>

12
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:42,041
I am Basil Palacios' cousin-in-law.

13
00:00:42,125 --> 00:00:43,626
<i>I'd like to get his things.</i>

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:47,338
<i>Ma'am, we didn't get any items from</i>
<i>Sir Basil when he was brought here.</i>

15
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:49,007
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

16
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,717
<i>Are you here to watch me grieve?</i>

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,677
I also lost a husband.

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,636
Exactly.

19
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,513
Maybe you prayed for this.

20
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,557
George, why would I pray for this?

21
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,143
Because you don't want me to be happy!

22
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,728
You want me to be like you.

23
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,146
No husband.

24
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:04,522
All alone.

25
00:01:04,606 --> 00:01:05,857
A widow!

26
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,233
<i>Ruth? How are you doing?</i>

27
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,735
<i>Have you talked to George yet?</i>

28
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,028
<i>Please, Mercy.</i>

29
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,362
Get real!

30
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,699
I know the feeling of a mother
whose daughter is grieving.

31
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:19,412
Hey, Mercy, I don't need any concern
from anyone in your family!

32
00:01:19,496 --> 00:01:20,914
- You're too much!
- My goodness!

33
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,999
You're worse! Stop bothering me!

34
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,417
One day you'll get what you deserve!

35
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:26,461
One day you will too!

36
00:01:26,544 --> 00:01:30,131
This is my way of grieving!
I'm looking for someone to hurt.

37
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:32,801
- Stop it! What the heck?!
- Come on, fight back!

38
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,469
PREVIOUSLY

39
00:01:34,552 --> 00:01:36,137
<i>I will not fight with you.</i>

40
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>Go back to your husband.</i>

41
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,015
<i>Cry for him.</i>

42
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,225
<i>Embrace him.</i>

43
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:42,519
<i>This is the last time</i>
<i>you'll be able to do that.</i>

44
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,480
<i>We found massive amounts of morphine</i>
<i>in Basil's system.</i>

45
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:47,273
<i>What? Morphine?</i>

46
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,443
Massive amounts of morphine
indicating foul play.

47
00:01:50,527 --> 00:01:53,863
There's no amount that would indicate
that this is not accidental.

48
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:55,448
<i>Basil is allergic to morphine.</i>

49
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:57,575
<i>He wouldn't just take it on purpose.</i>

50
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,911
Someone poisoned my husband.

51
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,789
- Who did this to him?!
- George, calm down.

52
00:02:02,872 --> 00:02:05,250
I'll have this investigated!

53
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,586
The person who poisoned
my husband will pay!

54
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,421
Jerico, do you think…

55
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:15,510
I did that to Basil?

56
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,537
Who poisoned you, Basil?

57
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,706
Who poisoned you?

58
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,544
Who?

59
00:02:49,627 --> 00:02:51,170
Who?

60
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,672
Oh, my…

61
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,220
Sam.

62
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,639
What's wrong?

63
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,559
I thought everything was fine
with the baby?

64
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,650
What? What?

65
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:57,570
I just thought of Paco

66
00:03:57,654 --> 00:04:01,032
because of what happened to Basil.

67
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,582
Ma, can we go home now?

68
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,084
Yeah, of course.

69
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,252
Of course, of course.

70
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,586
Come on, let's go.

71
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,004
Come on.

72
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,721
Careful.

73
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,769
Basil.

74
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,239
Son.

75
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:43,783
Basil!

76
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:47,287
Pa, I will find out who did this to Basil.

77
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:51,207
That's what I promised him, Pa.

78
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:58,673
And I won't stop until I find
the monster who poisoned him.

79
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:06,764
My son!

80
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:09,309
Basil.

81
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,022
Basil.

82
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,364
My son!

83
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:26,534
No…

84
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,581
You can't die.

85
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:43,384
Stop! Stop!

86
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:44,844
Stop what you're doing!

87
00:05:44,927 --> 00:05:46,304
Don't do anything!

88
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,680
Here, here.

89
00:05:49,807 --> 00:05:51,642
Ma'am George called.

90
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,063
She and Sir Galvan
will ask for an investigation

91
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,481
into everything that happened.

92
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,483
They will have it investigated?

93
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:04,280
Sir Basil's death was not an accident.

94
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,451
He was poisoned.

95
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,372
Animal.

96
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,209
Whoever did this to Basil is an animal!

97
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:18,753
Who?

98
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,380
Who did this to Sir Basil?

99
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:23,299
That's why they'll have it investigated.

100
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,095
So they can find out what really happened.

101
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:29,430
So they can find out

102
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,350
who poisoned him.

103
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,936
I will…

104
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:36,729
I will personally kill

105
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,732
whoever poisoned my son-in-law.

106
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:41,984
I will personally do it.

107
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,424
Sam!

108
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,634
Sam!

109
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,470
Sam, why are you hurrying?

110
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,266
Be careful, please.

111
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:15,393
That child is the future
of Palacios Mining.

112
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:20,231
I can't rely on Rebecca to succeed me.

113
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,900
Really, Aurora?

114
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:28,406
My son, Basil, just died,

115
00:07:29,031 --> 00:07:31,534
and you're still thinking
about the company?

116
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,536
You really don't care about my son.

117
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,122
Don't be a hypocrite, Galvan.

118
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:37,290
Earlier,

119
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:40,334
while Basil was in the ER,

120
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,588
you were still thinking about
the company, right?

121
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:46,132
You said that Basil
was going to succeed me.

122
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,385
Yeah, but he's gone.

123
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,389
Basil is gone! He's gone!

124
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:56,017
He's gone!

125
00:07:57,351 --> 00:07:59,729
- I'm sorry. That's enough…
- No, it is.

126
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:01,230
Stop crying.

127
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:03,983
You didn't even look at him in the morgue.

128
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,320
Why are you here?

129
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,323
Did you come here

130
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:13,784
to make sure that Basil died?

131
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:14,869
What?

132
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:17,205
"If you outlive me."

133
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,875
That's the last thing you told Basil.

134
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,924
You're really trying to steal
my moment, huh?

135
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,468
You're not just showing everyone here
that you have the most power

136
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:32,595
in the company and the family?

137
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,724
Good to know the message
was sent clear, Basil.

138
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,059
Pathetic.

139
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,812
Well, you need to remind everyone
that you're still the CEO.

140
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,483
Because soon, your reign will be over.

141
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,194
Why? Because you will steal it?

142
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:52,114
Dream on, Basil.

143
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,951
You will never steal my company from me.

144
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,410
Your company?

145
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,828
It's not yours!

146
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,497
It has never been!

147
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:03,251
It has always been Palacios Mining
for a hundred years now!

148
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:07,380
It was not, is not, and will never be

149
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,589
Aurora's Mining!

150
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,009
I'm also a Palacios.

151
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:14,136
I own it too.

152
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:16,138
Don't treat it as your own.

153
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,307
You're so greedy.

154
00:09:20,101 --> 00:09:22,895
That's why you lost your son,
whom you tried to control!

155
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,523
Because you're so greedy!

156
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,993
Enjoy it while you still can,
Auntie Aurora.

157
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,788
Because now that
your precious Paco is dead,

158
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:44,208
stripping away your position
will be as easy

159
00:09:44,292 --> 00:09:45,960
as flicking a switch.

160
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:52,675
You really think you can be CEO, Basil?

161
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,179
Your delusion will only happen

162
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:59,849
if you outlive me!

163
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,102
Because while I am still alive,

164
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:08,649
you will never be the CEO of my company!

165
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,176
You didn't want my son to outlive you.

166
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:36,927
That's why you poisoned him.

167
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:37,887
What?

168
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,597
It's you who poisoned him.

169
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,723
Well, that's ridiculous!

170
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,224
You murderer!

171
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,312
Pa! Pa!

172
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:47,647
Let go of Aurora!

173
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,080
Is that true?

174
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,083
Stay out of this, George.

175
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,710
You're not included in the conversation.

176
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,837
Let go of me.

177
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:20,429
I did not and will never harm
my own nephew.

178
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:23,599
Galvan, why would you even think that?

179
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,935
Because you were mad at him.

180
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,230
He's a big threat to replace you
in the company!

181
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:32,358
Yes, you bet he is!

182
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,985
But Basil is family.

183
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,029
Blood of my blood.

184
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,823
Yes, it's true.

185
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,118
I will never allow your son
to steal my position.

186
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,538
And I have hundreds of ways
to prevent that.

187
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:49,291
But killing my own blood
is not one of them.

188
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,713
Galvan, we are still family,

189
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,800
no matter how dysfunctional we are.

190
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:01,053
We're family.

191
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,555
We're blood-related.

192
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:08,060
And even if families fight,

193
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:09,645
they protect each other.

194
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,441
They love each other.

195
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,402
They don't kill each other.

196
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,648
Ward…

197
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:58,152
It was my dream to have a brother, George.

198
00:13:00,070 --> 00:13:01,697
I was given one,

199
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,409
but he was taken right away.

200
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,122
Stop crying.

201
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:11,749
Stop crying.

202
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,593
Is Basil really gone?

203
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:25,346
Is it true that he's gone?

204
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,558
What will happen to us?

205
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,229
Will they throw us out of here?

206
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,776
I'm sorry, George.

207
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:53,749
Condolences, George.

208
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:06,220
You will investigate Basil's case?

209
00:14:38,586 --> 00:14:40,504
I will take care of Ma'am Aurora.

210
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,964
You rest.

211
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,055
Sam.

212
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,016
Is what Mother and I heard true?

213
00:14:52,474 --> 00:14:54,727
It was morphine that poisoned Basil?

214
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:08,490
Morphine? Just like my medicine?

215
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,411
They might accuse you.

216
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,676
Sam, where are you going?

217
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:40,898
Shall we?

218
00:15:45,778 --> 00:15:47,404
The party started on time.

219
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,699
Almost all the invited guests came.

220
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:05,422
<i>Some of them I didn't know.</i>

221
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,926
Okay.

222
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:12,262
Did you notice anything unusual
or even suspicious?

223
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:20,062
Aside from Auntie Aurora announcing that
Sam was pregnant and the power outage,

224
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:21,897
it was a normal party.

225
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:25,359
So, you were with Mr. Palacios
the whole time?

226
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,986
No.

227
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:29,822
He was busy attending to the guests.

228
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:32,950
Most likely, they will look for a suspect.

229
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,787
And then they'll say…

230
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,163
he wasn't killed.

231
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,127
In the end, he committed suicide
just like Sir Paco.

232
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:44,837
No, Cairo.

233
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,047
Sir Basil was poisoned.

234
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,257
That's for sure!

235
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,344
So, who's the killer?

236
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,848
Who knows? Maybe he's with us now.

237
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,642
Right in our midst, roaming around.

238
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:01,895
Jerico!

239
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:07,067
Was it you?

240
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:11,739
I'm just kidding!

241
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,157
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Stop that!

242
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,200
- You jerk!
- You're also a jerk!

243
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,869
Why are you accusing me?

244
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:21,206
When you talked to Mr. Palacios
before he went up for his toast,

245
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,917
did he mention anything that
can be connected to this?

246
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,087
Nothing. We just talked about
some personal matters.

247
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,631
Basil, I can't get pregnant.

248
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,427
Don't cry, okay?

249
00:17:35,345 --> 00:17:36,680
It's okay.

250
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,224
Nothing changes.

251
00:17:39,683 --> 00:17:41,685
If we can't have children,

252
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,395
so be it.

253
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,898
It will just be you and me

254
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:47,816
from this day

255
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,861
until the end of our days.

256
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,614
But a few days ago,

257
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,199
I saw Basil

258
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,326
secretly talking to someone
over the phone.

259
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:00,496
I know.

260
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:04,666
Stupid girl.

261
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,044
It was just a joke.

262
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,963
- Just a joke!
- Guys, calm down.

263
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,467
You shouldn't even joke about that!
I might get punished!

264
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,344
Why? Because you're guilty, right?

265
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,971
- You're so violent! You're guilty!
- Me, guilty? Do you have an evidence?

266
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,014
- You're being violent!
- That's enough.

267
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,350
Maybe it was really you
who poisoned Sir Basil!

268
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,310
What did you say, DJ?

269
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,899
Jerico, you poisoned Basil?!

270
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,412
Ms. Georgina.

271
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,753
Answer me. Did you poison my husband?

272
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,924
That's not true, ma'am.

273
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:57,010
What is DJ talking about?

274
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,847
Ms. Georgina, please.

275
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,143
We have a potential suspect here!

276
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:07,312
DJ, go ahead and talk. Tell us the truth.

277
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,231
Why are you saying that he poisoned Basil?

278
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:12,651
We were just joking, ma'am.
It was really just a joke.

279
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,862
But Jerico got pissed off right away.

280
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,906
Maybe you don't know, ma'am,
but the other day,

281
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:20,450
Sir Basil and Jerico fought.

282
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,078
This is between me and this gutter trash.

283
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,329
What?

284
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,789
Hey!

285
00:19:25,873 --> 00:19:26,707
Basil!

286
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,417
You fool!

287
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,585
Basil!

288
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,878
Stop it, sir!

289
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:34,715
You jerk! Try to avoid this!

290
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,176
What?

291
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:41,221
And after they fought, Jerico said,

292
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,390
"It will soon end."

293
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,351
Those rich people
are really something else.

294
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,479
<i>Poor people like us</i>
<i>are just their punching bags.</i>

295
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:50,898
Don't worry.

296
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,357
It will soon end.

297
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:54,484
Just based on that, you think I did it?

298
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,903
I wouldn't know with you!

299
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,073
Basil aimed the gun at you.

300
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:03,660
That's why you got mad at him.
You have a motive!

301
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:05,746
This was your revenge!

302
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,414
- You poisoned Basil!
- Ma'am. Ma'am.

303
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,208
- You poisoned my husband!
- Calm down.

304
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,084
- How dare you?!
- Ma'am, enough.

305
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,211
Ma'am, that's enough!

306
00:20:12,294 --> 00:20:14,004
Stop abusing Jerico! Guys, please!

307
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,590
If you were mad at him,
you could've just beaten him up!

308
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:17,674
- Not poisoned him!
- Stop!

309
00:20:17,758 --> 00:20:20,093
No! No! Stop accusing Jerico!

310
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:21,345
He's innocent!

311
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:22,888
I'm the killer!

312
00:20:25,474 --> 00:20:28,227
I poisoned Basil.

313
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:35,359
I killed Basil.

314
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:41,823
He took Tonyo away from me.

315
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:44,159
Rebecca, shut up!

316
00:20:45,535 --> 00:20:48,247
Will you take responsibility
for everyone who died here?

317
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,665
No, no, no…

318
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,209
Look.

319
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:53,168
You see?

320
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,380
I'm not lying this time.

321
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:00,008
I killed Basil.

322
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:02,261
I poisoned him.

323
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:07,849
You poisoned him?

324
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,103
Yes, I did.

325
00:21:11,186 --> 00:21:12,813
I poisoned him.

326
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:17,442
With rat poison.

327
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,028
I did.

328
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,614
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry!

329
00:21:27,327 --> 00:21:30,872
You didn't give your boss her medicine!

330
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,709
Go take her inside!

331
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,876
But do you see? Look.

332
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,504
Get out of my face, Rebecca!
The both of you, get out!

333
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,464
- No, no, I'm telling the truth!
- Get out!

334
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:40,465
Ma'am, let's go, let's go.

335
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:42,467
Guys, please, listen to me!

336
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,886
I'm telling the truth! He's innocent!

337
00:21:45,345 --> 00:21:46,680
What's with you?

338
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:48,932
What are you waiting for?

339
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:51,852
This suspect is right in front of us!

340
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:58,400
We are talking about a very serious crime.

341
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:03,613
Don't joke about who the real killer is.

342
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,408
If you have any information

343
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:08,243
or if you want to tell me something,

344
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:11,705
say it to me during the interview.

345
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,832
I will talk to you individually.

346
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,254
But for now, leave. Go and leave.

347
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:21,757
Go on!

348
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,216
Abdul, what's with you?

349
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,426
What are you waiting for?

350
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,136
Why won't you arrest him?

351
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:30,432
George, that's not how
the investigation works.

352
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,977
I understand that you're mad

353
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:38,065
and that you want to find out
who poisoned your husband,

354
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:40,692
but you can't do this.

355
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:43,820
You can't accuse anybody without evidence.

356
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:48,784
Just because you pointed him out
doesn't automatically make him a suspect.

357
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:53,538
It's not that simple.

358
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:19,189
Ms. Samantha!

359
00:23:21,274 --> 00:23:22,859
Ms. Samantha,

360
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,529
where are you going?

361
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:30,450
Okay, you can go ahead.

362
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:35,705
I left my cell phone at the party.

363
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,541
Didn't we tell everyone

364
00:23:37,624 --> 00:23:40,335
that no one is allowed to enter
the crime scene?

365
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,987
Oh my God, Galvan!

366
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:08,697
You scared me.

367
00:24:13,076 --> 00:24:14,953
What are you doing here?

368
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,706
Will you be accusing me again?

369
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,670
I hate you for accusing me
of poisoning Basil.

370
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,515
But I understand you.

371
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:40,270
When Paco died, I accused Sam too.

372
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:42,898
I wanted justice.

373
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,774
I wanted someone I could blame

374
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,693
for what happened to my son.

375
00:24:48,028 --> 00:24:50,947
If you didn't poison my son…

376
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:56,369
why can't you face him?

377
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:01,583
Because Paco's death
is still fresh for me, Galvan.

378
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:07,047
I see my son in your son.

379
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:09,591
I don't want to feel the pain again.

380
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,971
Until when do you feel the pain
of losing a child?

381
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:16,765
- Until when?
- I…

382
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,226
I think it will never end.

383
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:26,733
Serge, I really need my cell phone.

384
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,903
Okay.

385
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,738
If we find something, I'll give it to you.

386
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,616
You had better go back.

387
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,251
- Sis?
- Sam?

388
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:46,711
Come on, let's go in.

389
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:48,546
Let's go in.

390
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:53,802
Let's go inside.

391
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:58,556
Let's go in. It's cold.

392
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,771
The pain will stay right here
as long as we live.

393
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:09,651
It hurts because we know that
we'll never see them again.

394
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:15,657
It hurts because we will never
embrace them again.

395
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,247
Do me a favor then.

396
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:25,083
What?

397
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,669
Preserve my son.

398
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,714
Preserve? How?

399
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,717
Preserve my son
just like your taxidermies.

400
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,847
They are dead,
but it's as if they are still there.

401
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,141
Aurora…

402
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,145
I don't want to lose Basil.

403
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,149
Even if he's already dead,
I want him to be there.

404
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,526
I still want to see him.

405
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,155
- Are you out of your mind? No!
- Aurora, please.

406
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:56,906
Aurora, please.

407
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:00,535
I still want to be able to see Basil.

408
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:03,330
I still want to be with him.

409
00:27:03,413 --> 00:27:06,166
Please, please, I'm begging you.

410
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,292
No. No.

411
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:08,710
- Please!
- I won't do that.

412
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:11,046
Please, preserve my son!

413
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:14,299
- I won't do it, Galvan.
- Preserve him, please.

414
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:15,967
Please.

415
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,261
Please.

416
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:27,520
Preserve my son, please!

417
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,233
I still want to see him.

418
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,528
I still want to see him.

419
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,740
Stop it, Galvan. Stop it.

420
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:40,867
Galvan, please stop.

421
00:27:57,759 --> 00:27:59,886
Sir Amando…

422
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,306
is George still there?

423
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,060
Why are you looking for her here?

424
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,814
I was thinking that maybe
she'd followed Sir Galvan.

425
00:28:10,897 --> 00:28:14,651
Sir Galvan was in the workshop earlier
with Ma'am Aurora,

426
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,570
but you can't go to the third floor.

427
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:18,780
It's not allowed.

428
00:28:23,076 --> 00:28:24,828
Just wait outside.

429
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,579
Okay, sir.

430
00:31:26,426 --> 00:31:27,552
Where is she?

431
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,589
Did you contact all the guests?

432
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,758
There are just a few
who are not here, sir.

433
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:52,261
But the ones we've contacted
are willing to be interviewed.

434
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,722
We've also secured the area

435
00:32:54,806 --> 00:33:00,979
and checked the paths that Mr. Palacios
possibly walked through,

436
00:33:01,062 --> 00:33:03,231
and examined the evidence
for possible leads.

437
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,071
Did Mr. Palacios use one of those glasses?

438
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,906
Hopefully, sir, one of those,

439
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,617
because we collected all the wine glasses

440
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,369
near the stage.

441
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:18,287
So I hoped one of these is…

442
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:20,415
Any other evidence?
How about his cell phone?

443
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:21,874
Maybe we can find a lead from that.

444
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,459
That's the problem.

445
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:28,339
We didn't find anything in the hospital
or on the stage.

446
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,843
Let's go. Let's start the interview.

447
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:50,153
Sam.

448
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,821
Sam, come here.

449
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,868
Sam, what are you doing here?

450
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:58,327
They already told you that
this area is prohibited.

451
00:33:58,411 --> 00:33:59,871
Why are you being so stubborn?

452
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,540
I'm looking for my cell phone.

453
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:04,917
Maybe you didn't misplace it here.

454
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,627
Maybe you lost it somewhere else.

455
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:09,213
If it had been lost here,
they would've found it by now.

456
00:34:10,882 --> 00:34:13,509
And Sam, why are you so worried
about that cell phone anyway?

457
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:18,556
What's inside that phone?

458
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:24,228
Sam?

459
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,442
You forgot your vitamins.

460
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:31,819
Thank you, Mother.

461
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,241
I need to go somewhere.

462
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,202
I'll be back later.

463
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,800
Mother,

464
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:55,384
I'll go ahead to the funeral chapel.

465
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,262
I'll ask Peter to come back to fetch you.

466
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,515
George, wait for me. I'll go with you.

467
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,683
Otherwise, you might fight with someone

468
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:05,686
just like you did with Rebecca and Jerico.

469
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:09,649
Mother, I'm just fighting with the people
who add to my stress.

470
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,031
What? What is it this time?

471
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:21,702
We need Mr. Palacios' cell phone
to look for possible leads.

472
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,330
Your husband's cell phone wasn't
among his possessions.

473
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,083
So Basil's cell phone is missing?

474
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,126
Go look for it then.

475
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:30,294
Well, that's why we're here.

476
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,505
We need permission to search the premises.

477
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:34,924
Fine, let's look for it.

478
00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:36,968
Let's go.

479
00:35:37,051 --> 00:35:39,095
Basil's cell phone is missing.

480
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:13,880
I hope Basil left his phone
here in our room.

481
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,719
I never saw it because I haven't
slept in here after…

482
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,381
Sergeant!

483
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,189
Whose drawer is this, Ms. Georgina?

484
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,107
That's mine.

485
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:58,276
Is Basil's cell phone there?

486
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,361
No, but we found something else.

487
00:38:00,444 --> 00:38:01,946
What?

488
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:04,573
Morphine tablets.

489
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:07,368
Wasn't this what was used
in your husband's death?

490
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:11,998
What's that morphine tablet

491
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,833
doing in my drawer?

492
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,420
Well, that's my question to you.

493
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:21,173
What is morphine doing in your possession?

494
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:56,334
Why are the remains of my nephew
still not here?

495
00:38:56,834 --> 00:39:01,255
It passed through forensic autopsy,
and they haven't released the body to us.

496
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,968
Just bring my nephew's body here ASAP
so my brother can mourn him properly.

497
00:39:06,719 --> 00:39:08,054
- Yes, ma'am.
- Now.

498
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:08,929
Okay.

499
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,681
Mrs. Palacios,

500
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:14,518
why do you have morphine in your drawer?

501
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,896
I don't know. It's not mine!

502
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:19,774
Look. I'm not that stupid.

503
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:23,319
If that was mine,
I wouldn't be letting you see it.

504
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:26,113
Well, then how do you explain this?

505
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:29,450
Someone might be framing me up.

506
00:39:29,533 --> 00:39:33,537
Maybe it's Basil's killer
who put that in my drawer.

507
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,376
It was morphine that poisoned Basil?

508
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:40,211
Morphine? Just like my medicine?

509
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,053
Sam, where are you going?

510
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:46,318
<i>I will follow your orders, Basil.</i>

511
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:50,322
<i>But I will make sure it's you</i>
<i>who will go to jail.</i>

512
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:53,451
<i>You will be accused of killing George.</i>

513
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,380
<i>I'm sorry, George.</i>

514
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:33,968
<i>It was Basil who I meant</i>
<i>to pin it on, not you.</i>

515
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:38,973
Believe me!

516
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:41,141
Someone is framing me!

517
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,936
What's your basis for saying that,
Ms. Georgina?

518
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,230
I received a letter.

519
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:48,315
A death threat.

520
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:02,663
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

521
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,040
At first, I thought it was just a prank.

522
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:11,672
But I started to get scared and worry
when someone almost ran me over.

523
00:43:17,636 --> 00:43:20,180
Ma'am, did you file a blotter
for the death threat?

524
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,140
No.

525
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:28,188
Because she called me
when the incident happened,

526
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:31,025
and I urged Ms. Georgina to report it.

527
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:32,401
But you didn't.

528
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:36,780
I had…

529
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:40,117
I had another problem at that time.

530
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:43,412
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Palacios,

531
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,291
but it will take a miracle
for you to bear a child.

532
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,711
There's really nothing we can do.

533
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:53,839
Is this about your husband?

534
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:56,717
Were there problems there?

535
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,886
That's personal.

536
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,639
Well, in a murder investigation,

537
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:04,975
it's usually the personal things
that matter.

538
00:44:07,353 --> 00:44:10,981
I was having problems
with Basil's birthday party.

539
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,317
I wanted it to be perfect

540
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:17,446
because Basil wanted everything done
according to his instructions.

541
00:44:18,405 --> 00:44:22,076
Little did I know that someone
would kill my husband!

542
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:24,995
And after turning me into a widow,

543
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,124
that killer wants it to look like
I poisoned Basil!

544
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,253
Ma'am Georgina,

545
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:35,464
the death threat you mentioned,

546
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:37,257
do you still have the letter?

547
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,760
Yes.

548
00:44:39,843 --> 00:44:41,136
It's in the library.

549
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,701
Abdul will not forsake George.

550
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,371
Don't worry about the morphine
we saw in her bag.

551
00:45:07,454 --> 00:45:10,791
First of all, no one should know
about that morphine.

552
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,837
And second, no one should know
about your sister and Abdul!

553
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,965
George is having an affair
with the investigator?

554
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,052
Someone else is trying to make a scene
at your husband's wake.

555
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:24,054
I'm telling you, Georgina,

556
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,389
if you're not careful,

557
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,433
you might lose your position in the estate

558
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,435
because of that mother and her daughter.

559
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,853
Protect your place.

560
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:34,148
Because if you don't, you will go back
to the slums you came from.

561
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:37,860
The wine glass that Mr. Palacios
used was found.

562
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,486
There are two sets of fingerprints on it.

563
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,529
Two sets?

564
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:41,989
So one of those may belong to the killer.

565
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,700
George, Mercy heard
my conversation with Ward.

566
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:47,578
She already knows about the morphine
and your relationship with Abdul.

567
00:45:47,661 --> 00:45:49,079
<i>George, I'm sorry.</i>

568
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:52,583
<i>You need to get ahead of them before</i>
<i>she exposes you to your in-laws.</i>

569
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:56,086
You and Sir Galvan need to know
something about George.

570
00:45:56,170 --> 00:45:59,548
- Mother.
- What about George, Mercy?

571
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,134
Mr. Galvan, do you already have a suspect?

572
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:05,637
Once the investigation is done,
you'll get your answers.

573
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:08,056
We have new evidence that points
to a new suspect.

574
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:08,932
Who?

575
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:10,476
Mr. Francis Castillo.

576
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,019
Shoot him!

577
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,562
- Mother! Mother!
- Shoot him!

578
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,230
Go ahead and continue! Shoot him!

579
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,608
