1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,808
I won't leave until I say goodbye
to my husband.

2
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:18,309
<i>So you want to say goodbye?</i>

3
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>Say goodbye to the person you killed!</i>

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:22,939
Back off!

5
00:00:23,022 --> 00:00:25,608
Be thankful my mother taught me
to respect others.

6
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,153
Because if she hadn't,
that's not all I'd have done to you.

7
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:31,740
Goodbye, Paco.

8
00:00:31,823 --> 00:00:34,325
Sergeant Major Casas, why are you here?

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,579
George, you left me
without any explanation.

10
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,331
Is this what you wanted?
To marry a rich guy?

11
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:41,207
Are you happy?

12
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,376
PREVIOUSLY

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:46,880
His soul is restless, Sam.
Because he was killed.

14
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:48,465
You killed Papa!

15
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,134
- We're over. It's over between us.
- Sam, no! Sam, no!

16
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:52,302
- I will destroy you!
- Don't do that!

17
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,678
Don't do that or I will commit suicide!

18
00:00:53,762 --> 00:00:55,138
- I will kill myself.
- Go ahead and commit suicide!

19
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:57,140
<i>- I don't care!</i>
<i>- You don't believe me?</i>

20
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,892
<i>You pushed him.</i>

21
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,394
I was there. Took a video of you guys.

22
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:03,438
It was an accident. I didn't mean to.

23
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:05,648
I will not leak the video,
but I need something in return.

24
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,900
I have a perfect life now.

25
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:08,860
There's nothing more I could ask for
with Basil.

26
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,862
I want you to kill someone for me.

27
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,656
I love him so much, and he loves me.

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,868
I want you to kill my wife.

29
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,369
George?

30
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,584
Is this some kind of joke?

31
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,170
Sam, look at me.

32
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,755
Look at me.

33
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,466
Do I look like I'm joking?

34
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:33,927
I'm serious as hell.

35
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:37,138
I want you to kill your best friend
the way you killed your husband.

36
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,016
Faultless. Something that
looks like an accident.

37
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,857
Look.

38
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,069
I don't know what kind of prank
you're trying to pull here, but…

39
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:53,404
but I have no time for this,
Basil, please.

40
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,409
I'm not yet done with you.

41
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,497
This conversation is not over
until I say it's over.

42
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,583
Are you out of your mind?

43
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,086
Do you want me to kill George?

44
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,546
Why?

45
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,090
Because I don't want her anymore.

46
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,593
I'm sick and I'm tired of George,

47
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:18,471
and I want George out of my life,
preferably dead.

48
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,183
Hey, where is your husband, by the way?

49
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,853
Tell him to drink with us.

50
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,563
- Yes, invite Basil.
- Yes.

51
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:28,231
What time is it?

52
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:29,816
Maybe Basil is hungry already.

53
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,318
Okay, okay, that's okay.

54
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:36,739
You need to take care
of your husband well.

55
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:38,950
You should be the best wife

56
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,995
so he can't live without you.

57
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:44,080
- So, you should go.
- You're right with that, Mother.

58
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,415
- Hold on, Mother, okay?
- Yes!

59
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,541
- Let's celebrate!
- Yes!

60
00:02:46,624 --> 00:02:47,917
Hey, son, the dance steps.

61
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,836
- There you go!
- Teach me.

62
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,964
But I thought you loved George?

63
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:55,383
I did. And now I don't.

64
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,931
If you and your wife have a problem,
don't involve me.

65
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:03,433
- Fix it.
- Exactly!

66
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,977
See? You understand. I am fixing it.

67
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:09,939
What do you do with something
you have no more use for?

68
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:12,442
You discard it, right?
You throw it away.

69
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,278
Only this time, you're helping me
take George out of the equation,

70
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:16,946
by killing her

71
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:18,781
and making it look like an accident.

72
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,366
I'm not a killer!

73
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,201
Yes, you are!

74
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:23,453
You killed your husband

75
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,455
and now you're gonna
kill your best friend.

76
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,040
Basil!

77
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,258
Basil!

78
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,385
No.

79
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:42,138
I can't do it. I can't!

80
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,723
My family and I will leave this place.

81
00:03:43,806 --> 00:03:45,767
We will stay away from this place.

82
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,768
Sam, you can only leave

83
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,062
once you're done with
what I ask you to do.

84
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,918
I will not kill George.

85
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,964
Okay, so you'd rather have everyone know
that you killed Paco?

86
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,298
I will say it was self-defense.

87
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,385
Self-defense or not,
you killed your husband.

88
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,761
You're a murderer!

89
00:04:21,844 --> 00:04:23,096
Why? How about you?

90
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,181
You're asking me to kill your wife, right?

91
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,140
You are a murderer.

92
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:27,934
I'm a murderer?

93
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:49,872
Me?

94
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:51,124
A murderer?

95
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,376
Why? Will you report me, Sam?

96
00:04:53,459 --> 00:04:56,587
- I will tell them you're blackmailing me.
- I will deny it.

97
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,923
I will deny everything.

98
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:01,884
And the people will believe me.

99
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,469
Why?

100
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,222
Because I'm a Palacios,

101
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,682
born and bred.

102
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:12,145
While you? You're just an intruder.

103
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,233
And I'm not the one
with the video of myself

104
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,193
killing my own partner.

105
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,630
Pa.

106
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,799
You look flustered.

107
00:05:42,383 --> 00:05:44,969
I'm sorry. I drank a little alcohol.

108
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,388
Mother and I are celebrating.

109
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,390
Celebrating what?

110
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,476
Haven't you heard, Pa?

111
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:53,770
The Castillos are leaving.

112
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,688
They're leaving?

113
00:05:58,191 --> 00:05:59,525
What's wrong?

114
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,070
It seems you don't want them to leave.

115
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:05,281
Wasn't it you who taught me

116
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,075
to beat your enemies so hard

117
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,494
to the point that
they can no longer recover?

118
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,080
Here it is. It's happening already.

119
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,875
The family who destroyed us will be gone.

120
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,222
Sam?

121
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,058
What are you doing there?

122
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:35,895
Why? Are you okay?

123
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,024
No. Why, are you in pain?

124
00:06:40,108 --> 00:06:41,734
What happened?

125
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,071
Nothing.

126
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:46,906
Sam, I thought we were leaving already?

127
00:06:46,989 --> 00:06:50,201
Mother got impatient,
so she asked me to fetch you.

128
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,162
Let's go.

129
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:03,256
Put all the things at the back
and get in the car right away.

130
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:04,757
Come on, hurry.

131
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,175
Mother, why aren't you in the car?

132
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,678
- Let's go. We need to hurry.
- Who called you earlier?

133
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,179
I don't want to worry you, Mother, please.

134
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,597
What do you mean?
Is there something happening?

135
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,474
Nothing. Just trust me, Mother, please.

136
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,892
- Come on, please.
- You're making me nervous.

137
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:17,103
Come on, Mother. Let's get in the car.
We need to leave.

138
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,688
- What happened?
- Nothing happened.

139
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,189
Just trust me, Mother.

140
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,482
Just trust me.

141
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,192
We need to leave. Let's go inside the car.

142
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,446
We need to leave. Francis, let's go.

143
00:07:26,529 --> 00:07:28,197
Come on, we need to go.

144
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,032
Are you leaving today?

145
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,290
We're going back to our old house.

146
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:39,167
You can't leave.

147
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,919
You can't leave.

148
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,338
Paco's memorial service
is scheduled for tomorrow.

149
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,716
Will you not attend the memorial service

150
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,718
of your own husband?

151
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,261
We'll just come back.

152
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,680
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

153
00:07:53,890 --> 00:07:55,600
You're worse than someone
trying to escape from something.

154
00:07:57,727 --> 00:07:59,979
Are you running from something, Sam?

155
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:06,486
Paco is the only reason why we lived here.

156
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:11,449
Now that Paco is gone,
there's no reason for us to stay here.

157
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,453
Knowing Paco,
Paco would want you to live here

158
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,330
even after he was dead.

159
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,584
But that's not what Ma'am Aurora wants.

160
00:08:21,667 --> 00:08:23,002
She doesn't want us. She doesn't…

161
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,879
Aurora is just grieving.

162
00:08:24,962 --> 00:08:27,256
She lost her only son.

163
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,509
Naturally, she's mad.

164
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,219
But not just with you.

165
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,720
With everybody.

166
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:37,725
I understand,
but for everybody's peace of mind,

167
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:40,102
I'll just leave her house.

168
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:41,812
Your house.

169
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:44,482
No, that's also your house…

170
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:48,110
literally, figuratively,

171
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:51,822
and soon, legally.

172
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,494
What do you mean?

173
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,247
As Paco's widow,

174
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:03,167
Sam will receive half of Paco's assets.

175
00:09:03,251 --> 00:09:06,837
His trust fund, his company shares,

176
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:10,675
his car collection, and that house.

177
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,136
Sam, you're rich.

178
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,346
You're rich already.

179
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:18,391
That's why you all have to stay here.

180
00:09:19,308 --> 00:09:21,602
And I will make sure…

181
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,230
that you will get what's rightfully yours.

182
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,107
Just trust me.

183
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,735
I'm your ally, Sam.

184
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:31,988
Sam can't leave.

185
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:32,947
Not now.

186
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,657
We need her.

187
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,451
What?

188
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,746
And what can Sam contribute to our family?

189
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:43,791
She's set to inherit
her husband's company shares.

190
00:09:43,874 --> 00:09:48,504
We need those to make sure
of Basil's ascension to the company.

191
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:53,884
Or else Aurora will still manage
Palacios Mining.

192
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:58,764
She will still be the one who's powerful,
not your husband.

193
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,308
Do you want that?

194
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:06,147
It might be a cliché,
but the saying is universally true.

195
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,401
Always keep your friends close

196
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:13,863
and your enemies closer.

197
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,580
Sam, congrats.

198
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,547
This is good.

199
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,675
That's great, Sam.

200
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,469
You're really rich.

201
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,513
Imagine, you can buy everything you want.

202
00:10:39,597 --> 00:10:41,349
Sam, just don't forget us, okay?

203
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:42,725
We're part of this. Right, Mother?

204
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,895
Let's prioritize your treatment first.

205
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,813
That's right, Mother.

206
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,525
Let's not wait for them
to give us the money.

207
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,527
Let's just leave.

208
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,404
I can work.

209
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,574
Sam, don't throw it all away.
What's wrong with you?

210
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,118
We're talking about big money here.
We're talking about billions.

211
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,913
I don't want them to think

212
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,457
that we're just waiting for the money,

213
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,376
or that I had ulterior motives
for marrying into their family.

214
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,337
Sam, don't think about it.
Don't worry about that.

215
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,924
Sir Galvan already said
that it's your right.

216
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:18,761
You're not a thief, and you didn't
take anything from them, right?

217
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,972
And the best thing here is that
you didn't do anything wrong, Sam.

218
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,252
Sam…

219
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,796
your brother has a point.

220
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,424
We can use that money.

221
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,467
And it was you who said

222
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,637
that if it's right,
you should fight for it.

223
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,692
You pushed him.

224
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:16,986
No.

225
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,446
<i>Yes, you did.</i>

226
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:19,447
<i>I was there.</i>

227
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,031
What do you want in return?

228
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,075
I want you to kill someone for me.

229
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,327
Your best friend.

230
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,515
Ma…

231
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,478
my family and I have decided

232
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:35,105
not to leave this place.

233
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:58,963
I can only imagine the pain

234
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,965
you must be going through right now.

235
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:07,680
And if there's a way

236
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:11,850
for me to lessen the pain you're carrying…

237
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,857
I'm here for you.

238
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:25,489
What?

239
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:32,121
Will your comforting ways

240
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,791
bring my son back to me?

241
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,548
Will he come back to life

242
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,468
if you reach out to me?

243
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,268
If it means he'll come back to life,

244
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:00,524
then okay,

245
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,820
I will embrace you.

246
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:11,994
I will accept you as my…

247
00:15:12,077 --> 00:15:14,455
as my daughter-in-law.

248
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:15,623
No.

249
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:21,670
I will love you as my own daughter.

250
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:27,426
I will forget all my anger towards you.

251
00:15:28,093 --> 00:15:31,055
I will accept you

252
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,349
and your family.

253
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,106
Just give me back my son.

254
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,462
But you can't do it, right?

255
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,300
Because you are not God.

256
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:55,264
I am also not God.

257
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:00,769
I thought I was powerful.

258
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:04,231
That I could do everything.

259
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:05,482
But…

260
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,319
but I was wrong.

261
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,999
I can't.

262
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,505
Hello, Basil.

263
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,632
I am here now. Where are you?

264
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,591
Basil?

265
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,594
Is that you?

266
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,686
I'm not playing with you.

267
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,938
I'm not joking with you.

268
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,826
You're a murderer.

269
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:22,035
You're a killer!

270
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,667
I'll take you with me!

271
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,046
Sam, wake up!

272
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:45,684
Sam.

273
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,019
My dear,

274
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:49,021
you were having a bad dream.

275
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:53,984
Have some water.

276
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,532
Is it Paco?

277
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,499
It's just normal.

278
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,960
Just fight.

279
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:13,879
Just fight, Sam.

280
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,965
Fight.

281
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,387
Among all of us,

282
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,390
you're the bravest.

283
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:28,727
You can handle…

284
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,313
everything.

285
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:44,553
Hello, babe?

286
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,514
Babe, I have good news.

287
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,891
I did it.

288
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,226
I know.

289
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:53,645
I told Sam everything.

290
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,192
Well, she has no choice.

291
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:01,236
She has to do what I asked her to do.

292
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,490
And after she kills George,
I will frame Sam.

293
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:11,663
And then she will lose her right
to Paco's inheritance.

294
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,417
I mean, I told you I would get everything.

295
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,878
Paco's money,

296
00:22:17,961 --> 00:22:20,088
freedom from my marriage,

297
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:22,883
and you.

298
00:22:24,301 --> 00:22:28,055
Babe, once all this is over,

299
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:31,016
we can be together again.

300
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,728
Yeah.

301
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,939
I know.

302
00:22:40,317 --> 00:22:41,943
I know, right?

303
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,196
Stupid girl.

304
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:52,662
<i>I have sinned against you, Paco.</i>

305
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:57,209
<i>If you make me pay in the afterlife,</i>
<i>then so be it.</i>

306
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,378
<i>But I will not let Basil control me.</i>

307
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:04,049
<i>I will not kill the person</i>
<i>I once treated like a sister.</i>

308
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:27,197
Sam?

309
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:28,949
Come in.

310
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:33,328
Sam, I don't have a jacket.

311
00:23:33,411 --> 00:23:34,412
Will this do?

312
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,581
Paco has a lot of jackets.

313
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:39,876
No one will use them now.
Wait, I'll get you one.

314
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,603
Here, see if this will fit you.

315
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:02,023
Thank you.

316
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:03,817
This is great, Sam.

317
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,110
Hold on.

318
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:12,701
Does it fit? There you go.

319
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:17,914
Yes, Sam.

320
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:21,501
I'll get going.

321
00:24:21,585 --> 00:24:23,211
Mother and I will wait for you.

322
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,921
Just wait for me downstairs.

323
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,883
Oh my God!

324
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:17,140
Oh my God.

325
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,266
Yuck!

326
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,645
Oh my God.

327
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:28,235
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

328
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:29,861
Yuck!

329
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:33,156
Girl, have some water.

330
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:39,204
You help someone who's drunk,
you don't laugh at them.

331
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:40,497
Give me that.

332
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,499
Oh my gosh, what the heck?

333
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:45,085
You're such a killjoy.
It was just a video.

334
00:25:45,168 --> 00:25:46,878
Oh my God.

335
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:48,797
Give me that.

336
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,341
- You're so rude!
- No.

337
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:53,385
Yuck.

338
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,262
I already deleted the videos.

339
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,639
They might have uploaded them
and they might have gone viral.

340
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,057
Gosh, that would have been so humiliating.

341
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,517
Are they your friends?

342
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,229
No.

343
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,275
They're my batchmates from the sorority.

344
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:13,905
Girl, if you have a sister like that,
forget about her.

345
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,199
Sisterhood should be about
protecting each other,

346
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:18,076
not destroying one another.

347
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,371
I don't have any friends on campus.

348
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,375
Well, you have one now.

349
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,377
Georgina.

350
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:33,341
It's okay.

351
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:35,176
Sam.

352
00:26:35,677 --> 00:26:37,012
Nice to meet you, Sam.

353
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,973
Drink the water, okay?

354
00:26:46,146 --> 00:26:47,731
I like this song.

355
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:49,232
You know this song?

356
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:50,442
You know this song?

357
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:51,985
It's my favorite.

358
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,572
Hey, we're alike.

359
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:00,535
Be careful.

360
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,537
Drink more water.

361
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,789
Love this song.

362
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,076
George?

363
00:28:33,211 --> 00:28:34,254
George?

364
00:28:35,004 --> 00:28:36,256
I'm home.

365
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,761
George?

366
00:28:43,471 --> 00:28:45,098
George…

367
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,394
George, can I ask for coffee?

368
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,236
George, please, I'm tired.

369
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,321
Where's the coffee?

370
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:12,459
George?

371
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,528
What do you think you're doing?

372
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,586
Sam, you're so basic.

373
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:41,214
Did you really think you can outsmart me?

374
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,883
Do you think that's the only video
of your murderous act?

375
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:48,471
I still have a lot of copies of that video
hidden in different places.

376
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:50,723
Let go of me.

377
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:35,393
Son…

378
00:31:40,481 --> 00:31:42,317
I'm sorry, son.

379
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:41,292
Sam, don't you get it?

380
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:43,503
You can't get away from this.

381
00:32:44,003 --> 00:32:45,755
Either you follow my orders

382
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,966
or I will expose the video.

383
00:32:49,175 --> 00:32:51,386
I will not do what you're asking me to do.

384
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,055
So you'd rather go to jail?

385
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,808
What happened to Paco was an accident.

386
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:58,601
This is different. What you're
asking me to do is different.

387
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:01,020
You're making me plan someone's murder.

388
00:33:02,021 --> 00:33:04,691
Sam, you know, at this point,

389
00:33:05,316 --> 00:33:06,776
I really don't care how you do it.

390
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:09,237
I just want it done.

391
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,698
You're wrong.

392
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,284
I am not a murderer.

393
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,456
Maybe you think I'm playing with you.

394
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,417
You'll see.

395
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,340
Oh, by the way, you can have this coffee.

396
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,679
You'll need it for what's coming for you.

397
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:15,178
Ma'am Aurora, I brought you your favorite.

398
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:17,930
Close the door, Amando.

399
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,745
You need to get up.

400
00:34:40,828 --> 00:34:43,581
Today is Sir Paco's memorial.

401
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,167
I don't want to go.

402
00:34:50,171 --> 00:34:52,924
It's embarrassing to the guests.

403
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:56,219
Do you think I care…

404
00:34:56,677 --> 00:34:59,597
about what the guests think?

405
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,226
I want to be alone, Amando.

406
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:07,605
Please, leave.

407
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,911
What about Sir Paco?

408
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,914
Won't you even say goodbye to him…

409
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:28,835
one last time?

410
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,100
How do you…

411
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:49,397
even say goodbye to your only son?

412
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,763
It's irritating.

413
00:37:03,846 --> 00:37:06,140
They're still here.

414
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,685
Now they have all Paco's wealth,

415
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:12,980
whereas we're still dependent
on your husband.

416
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,401
George, I didn't mean anything bad by it.

417
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,445
It's okay that we're getting an allowance.

418
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:22,281
At least your husband is alive
and he loves you.

419
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:29,705
I said, your husband loves you.

420
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:32,208
Why are you so quiet?

421
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:34,710
Is there a problem, George?

422
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,546
Nothing, Mother.

423
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:43,529
What are you looking at?

424
00:38:44,530 --> 00:38:47,575
Let's get this over and done with.

425
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:49,345
Paco always brought his camera with him

426
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,765
everywhere he went.

427
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,145
He loved taking pictures.

428
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,191
That was his dream,

429
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:05,569
to be a well-known photographer.

430
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:09,448
And he never gave up on that dream.

431
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,715
One time…

432
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:30,803
while he was taking my picture,

433
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,056
he told me,

434
00:40:35,182 --> 00:40:36,976
"Sam…

435
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,353
you have to know who you are…

436
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,399
or the world will tell you who you are."

437
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:03,002
I guess we can all agree when I say…

438
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:06,130
that Paco is a bit rebellious.

439
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,050
But that's one thing I liked about him.

440
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,599
He had principles

441
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,268
and convictions.

442
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:30,446
We should all be like Paco.

443
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,663
We shouldn't let others
dictate our choices.

444
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,542
Not even if we are threatened.

445
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:48,631
We should not be swayed
by what others want.

446
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:04,730
Excuse me.

447
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,358
I'd like to say something too.

448
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,118
Let's see where your courage takes you.

449
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:33,926
Hello, everyone, I know I'm not part

450
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,303
of the program but…

451
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:41,850
listening to Sam and her words
for my dear Paco,

452
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:43,769
I was moved.

453
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,147
And she was right.

454
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,858
Paco loved taking pictures.

455
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:52,987
And as they say,

456
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:56,240
a picture is worth a thousand words.

457
00:42:56,907 --> 00:43:00,035
So, a video…

458
00:43:01,495 --> 00:43:04,957
is certainly worth a million more.

459
00:43:09,336 --> 00:43:12,006
I'd like to show you guys something.

460
00:43:15,718 --> 00:43:16,802
Sam saw this already,

461
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:21,181
but it would be such a shame
if you didn't see this.

462
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,684
Right, Sam?

463
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:30,899
Sam, dear, what video is that?

464
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:36,113
You'd rather have everyone know
that you killed Paco?

465
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:38,115
You killed your husband.

466
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,283
You're a murderer!

467
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:53,505
Ladies and gentlemen,

468
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,549
I present to you…

469
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,721
the truth about Paco Palacios.

470
00:44:33,962 --> 00:44:36,340
Oops!

471
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,509
Silly me.

472
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,594
Wrong video.

473
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:49,937
<i>Hey, let's see who goes the farthest!</i>

474
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,772
<i>Game? Okay.</i>

475
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,441
<i>Basil, it must be beyond the frame</i>
<i>of the swing, okay?</i>

476
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,194
<i>Yes, do well because I know there's</i>
<i>a prize from Auntie Aurora.</i>

477
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,695
<i>- I know! What's the prize?</i>
<i>- There's a prize?</i>

478
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:00,572
<i>Yes!</i>

479
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,367
<i>- What now? Let's go.</i>
<i>- Game!</i>

480
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:07,538
<i>- I'll count now. In 3, 2, 1…</i>
<i>- Let's go. 3, 2…</i>

481
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,789
<i>Go!</i>

482
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,707
<i>Oh!</i>

483
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:12,334
<i>I effing won!</i>

484
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,086
<i>Basil's such a loser.</i>

485
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:17,506
<i>Loser!</i>

486
00:45:18,298 --> 00:45:20,050
<i>Basil!</i>

487
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:22,302
<i>What happened?</i>

488
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:23,262
<i>What happened?</i>

489
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,388
<i>I lost. I lost.</i>

490
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:26,598
<i>- He's a loser!</i>
<i>- Auntie Aurora!</i>

491
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,350
<i>Paco won.</i>

492
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:31,562
<i>Paco won.</i>

493
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:32,938
<i>No, it's okay.</i>

494
00:45:33,021 --> 00:45:34,398
<i>What's the prize?</i>

495
00:45:34,481 --> 00:45:36,358
<i>Secret, secret. Surprise!</i>

496
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:39,236
<i>- Auntie Aurora will tell you.</i>
<i>- A car?</i>

497
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:42,322
<i>- Another car? Wow.</i>
<i>- How about an apartment?</i>

498
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:43,574
<i>Apartment?</i>

499
00:45:43,657 --> 00:45:44,741
<i>- In Manila.</i>
<i>- I want a penthouse.</i>

500
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,119
<i>- Yeah?</i>
<i>- A penthouse in Manila.</i>

501
00:45:47,202 --> 00:45:49,246
<i>- That's mine.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

502
00:45:49,329 --> 00:45:50,247
<i>Loser.</i>

503
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:53,208
<i>Aw, Basil, do good next time!</i>

504
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,253
<i>Hey!</i>

505
00:45:57,337 --> 00:45:59,089
<i>Oh, these two.</i>

506
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:03,510
Paco has always been
the competitive Palacios.

507
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:05,971
Always wanting to be first.

508
00:46:06,054 --> 00:46:08,056
And even in death,

509
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:10,058
he got ahead of all of us.

510
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:14,188
My dear cousin…

511
00:46:14,855 --> 00:46:17,065
I miss you, my cousin.

512
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:21,111
Especially since I'll be celebrating
my birthday soon.

513
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,365
I promise

514
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,827
we will party in your name.

515
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:34,374
Party?

516
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,254
Paco just died, Basil.

517
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:41,256
And you'll have a party?

518
00:46:42,341 --> 00:46:47,012
No one is partying now or anytime soon.

519
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:48,514
But Auntie Aurora,

520
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:50,933
it's my birthday.

521
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,570
And it will be your last

522
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,739
if you push through with your party.

523
00:47:18,418 --> 00:47:20,879
This memorial is over.

524
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,924
This is only a waste of time.

525
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,851
You all talk

526
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,230
as if you know Paco well.

527
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:44,570
None of you knows my son the way I do.

528
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:52,369
None of you loves him the way I do!

529
00:48:56,850 --> 00:48:58,810
Aurora!

530
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,021
Aurora, hold on.

531
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,486
Aurora…

532
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,034
Aurora…

533
00:49:53,448 --> 00:49:55,701
Take care of my sister.

534
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,995
I'll take over leading this family…

535
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:02,207
while she is still grieving.

536
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,967
Paco!

537
00:50:21,768 --> 00:50:23,103
Aurora…

538
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,948
Slowly. You might get drunk.

539
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,369
Delete the video.

540
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,125
Not here.

541
00:51:28,835 --> 00:51:30,086
Come follow me.

542
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:40,096
Do this one favor for me.

543
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:42,557
Why me? Why don't you get a hitman?

544
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,851
I'm giving you until my birthday
to kill George.

545
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:46,603
- He wants you dead?
- Or replaced?

546
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:48,021
Who is this from?

547
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,022
