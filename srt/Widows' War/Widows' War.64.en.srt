1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,725
I just want you to know my stand on this.

2
00:00:16,808 --> 00:00:18,893
I am willing to return her child to her.

3
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:23,106
Don't do anything
that could destroy my lawyer's strategy.

4
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,985
Just make sure I don't need
to step inside the courtroom.

5
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,612
Based on her symptoms
and the baby's position,

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,531
she could give birth at any time.

7
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:34,200
So, you'd better make sure you're ready
with everything that needs doing.

8
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:35,285
I'm ready.

9
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:37,746
You admitted during direct examination

10
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,166
that you were diagnosed
with schizophrenia.

11
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:43,084
Yes, but I am well now.

12
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,627
Are you sure you're well?

13
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,880
I don't think Aurora can protect us.

14
00:00:46,963 --> 00:00:50,884
That's why we need to know
what's happening inside the court.

15
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:53,803
I know what's happening in the court.

16
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:56,848
You can go home now,
but I have a suggestion.

17
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:00,769
Let's go somewhere to relax. Are you game?

18
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,687
We already know where the kids are.

19
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,316
And my client will be filing
a separate petition for habeas corpus.

20
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,568
Do whatever you have to do

21
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:14,074
to stop what the other party
of that small attorney wants to do.

22
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,284
<i>Auntie Aurora gave</i>

23
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,330
my children to Auntie Larry
and Auntie Barry?

24
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:22,624
Will you let them destroy your character

25
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,834
so you won't
be able to get your children back?

26
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,045
No. No.

27
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,973
Ma'am, they will file a petition…

28
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:41,518
Habeas corpus.

29
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,198
Let's not overreact, ladies.

30
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,701
I promised you
that you would not be involved here.

31
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:00,787
My lawyers are already doing something.

32
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,455
Oh, come on.

33
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:06,960
Auro, darling. Please don't waste
your precious saliva explaining.

34
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:12,423
And besides, Barbara and I
have already reached a unanimous decision.

35
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,552
We're out.

36
00:02:16,553 --> 00:02:19,305
Out? Out of what?

37
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:23,017
Out of your side,
and we are already now on Team Rebecca.

38
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:24,519
What?

39
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,729
You can't be serious.

40
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:27,981
We're serious, Aurora.

41
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:32,485
We're going to give back
Rebecca's children…

42
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:37,490
before this whole mess explodes
and takes us down with you.

43
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:40,618
You traitors…

44
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:43,163
Call us whatever you want. We don't care.

45
00:02:43,246 --> 00:02:45,373
We are just protecting ourselves.

46
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:47,167
Just like I said,

47
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,044
we're going to give
the twins back to Rebecca,

48
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:53,298
since she is their real mother.

49
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,343
We can't take away that fact from her.

50
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:00,513
But, you agreed to adopt the twins.

51
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,393
Well, we had a change of heart.

52
00:03:05,476 --> 00:03:08,313
Something that you don't have.

53
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,359
Let's go.

54
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,470
Rebecca, are you stronger now?

55
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:44,557
Yes, Attorney.

56
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,434
That's good.

57
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:50,980
You need to be strong
to face all their defamation towards you.

58
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:54,400
I know what their next strategy is.

59
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:55,652
I also know that,

60
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,863
now we have proved to them

61
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,158
that my claims about my children
are not my hallucinations,

62
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:07,080
they will go against my capacity

63
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,749
to become a mother.

64
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:12,210
That's right.

65
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,005
They'll try to destroy you to doubt you.

66
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,717
Don't let them win, okay?

67
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:20,718
I won't.

68
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:22,553
I won't.

69
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,515
And thank you.

70
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,353
Thank you, Attorney.

71
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,148
Because you don't only treat me
as your client,

72
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:38,361
I'm like family to you.

73
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,407
Thank you so much because…

74
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:46,494
I can really feel your concern for me.

75
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,121
Thank you.

76
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:03,428
Leave, Amando.

77
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,430
I will leave but…

78
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,933
there's something I want to ask you.

79
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:13,646
What did Rebecca do wrong for you

80
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,692
to deprive her of…

81
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,861
her right to become a mother?

82
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,739
Is it because you're mad
at the twins' father?

83
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:25,199
That's why you can't accept

84
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,036
the children?

85
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,163
Shut up, Amando.

86
00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,998
If you love Rebecca…

87
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,834
just like you're saying…

88
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,632
you won't let her experience
what I experienced with Paco.

89
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,512
That he didn't know me.

90
00:05:49,348 --> 00:05:51,476
You didn't introduce me to him
as his father.

91
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,982
It's difficult to pretend
that you don't have a child

92
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:01,235
when you know that he's just there,

93
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:04,280
just within arm's reach.

94
00:06:06,657 --> 00:06:08,826
But you can't touch him.

95
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,371
You can't claim that he is your child.

96
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:19,587
If they call for me to testify,

97
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,382
I don't know what I'll say anymore.

98
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,636
If I will still do what
you asked me to do,

99
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:29,472
to contradict what Delia will say.

100
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,185
Or if I'll say what I know?

101
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,087
Hello?

102
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,713
Hello, Jericho?

103
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,382
Are you already in the parking lot?

104
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:07,051
Attorney and I are already here too.

105
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,053
We're on our way out of the office.

106
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,348
Attorney…

107
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,685
Come on. Please agree.

108
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,854
We'll just have dinner at home.

109
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,523
It's my way of saying thank you.
I will cook for you.

110
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:24,610
- Okay, but I won't stay long.
- Yes.

111
00:07:24,694 --> 00:07:26,112
I still have to study for my other cases.

112
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,114
Yes, I promise. I promise, really.

113
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:29,031
Thank you.

114
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,325
- Now, let's go.
- All right.

115
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,757
Rebecca, my child.

116
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:51,804
Ma'am Sam, please answer.

117
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,016
Please…

118
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,437
Rico…

119
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,522
What's happening to you?

120
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,108
Why have you been looking
so stressed for some time now?

121
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:05,610
Yeah, what's your problem?

122
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,904
You're really asking?

123
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,906
You're a bunch of jerks.

124
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:15,244
What are you doing here?

125
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,791
Rebecca, my child…

126
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,461
Forgive me.

127
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,299
Are you asking for forgiveness
because you're about to lose?

128
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:29,759
No.

129
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:36,140
I'm here to ask for your forgiveness
because I have wronged you.

130
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,019
But for all it's worth…

131
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:44,941
the things I told you before,
they're all true.

132
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,279
For my sake?

133
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:53,824
Yes. Yes, Rebecca.

134
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,452
You were so sick then.

135
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,704
You had episodes.

136
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:04,210
I was scared for the safety
of your children.

137
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,923
You can't even
take care of yourself, Rebecca.

138
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,217
You are seriously ill.

139
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,262
However good your intentions were,

140
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:20,476
you still had no right
to act like God to me and my children.

141
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,520
I know.

142
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:25,147
That's why I'm sorry.

143
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,776
I didn't know…

144
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:31,696
that everything would reach
this point, Rebecca.

145
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:34,115
Please…

146
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,200
Please forgive me.

147
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,246
Let's stop this.

148
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:43,416
Let's stop suing each other. You win.

149
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,043
I'll give you back your children.

150
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,505
I will talk to Larry and Barry.

151
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:52,800
But, please…

152
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,221
Please, Rebecca, my child.
I'm begging you.

153
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,764
Please forgive me.

154
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,435
I'm willing to forgive you…

155
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,188
and I'll drop the case.

156
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,200
But, I have conditions.

157
00:10:19,827 --> 00:10:21,162
First…

158
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:26,709
stop calling me your child.

159
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,005
You raised me like your niece, right?

160
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:33,799
Let us stay that way.

161
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:35,968
- Rebecca…
- Second…

162
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,722
Once I get my twins, we're done.

163
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,143
I don't want anything to do with you ever.

164
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,980
My children and I will leave
and you will not follow us.

165
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,274
You will not look for us.

166
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,658
- Go ahead, come closer. Come on.
- Hey, hey…

167
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:02,453
What's happening here?

168
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,205
It's Rico.

169
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,874
They ganged up on me
and dragged me. That's why…

170
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,042
Where are we going?

171
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,335
Hey, Ando, Bill. What's with you?

172
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:10,544
I'll be in trouble with Ma'am Aurora.

173
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,338
Ma'am George, Ma'am Sam, don't leave.

174
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:14,924
Ma'am Sam, don't. Don't leave.

175
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:16,926
Ma'am Sam escaped from me.

176
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,302
Escape from you?

177
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:19,804
What do you mean?

178
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,515
Ma'am Aurora asked me
to keep an eye on her and…

179
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,477
to never let her go out
of the compound, sir, until…

180
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,562
she gives birth.

181
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,109
<i>It's like Aurora is really</i>
<i>planning something with my grandchild.</i>

182
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,531
Why are you doing this to me, Rebecca?

183
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,827
Even if I never admitted to anyone…

184
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,579
that I'm your mother,

185
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,833
in my heart and mind,

186
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,254
I didn't erase the fact
that I'm your mother.

187
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,632
Rebecca…

188
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,760
I love you so much.

189
00:12:01,595 --> 00:12:03,514
I wasn't able to say that,

190
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:06,392
but I was able to make you feel that…

191
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:11,480
in every way, all the time.

192
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,607
Rebecca…

193
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,110
whenever you're happy,

194
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,821
I'm the first to be happy.

195
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:22,741
When you're sad,

196
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,370
I'm the first one who gets hurt.

197
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,788
Then why?

198
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,584
Why didn't you tell me…

199
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:34,503
that you're my mother and I am your child?

200
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:35,880
Why?

201
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,090
Because I got scared.

202
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:43,387
I didn't want to destroy
your image of me, Rebecca,

203
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:46,307
or everyone else's image of me.

204
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:50,102
I didn't want them
to find a fault with me.

205
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:53,564
For them to pinpoint…

206
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:56,692
Aurora Palacios' weakness.

207
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,613
That at one point in my life,

208
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:03,157
I was weak because of a man.

209
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:08,245
Is that the reason
why you killed Sam's father…

210
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,040
who happens to be my father too?

211
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,458
No.

212
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:16,754
That's not true, Rebecca.

213
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,340
I did not kill your father.

214
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,761
Apart from you and your brother, Paco,

215
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:28,224
there's only one man I loved
and that was Orly, your father.

216
00:13:29,266 --> 00:13:31,268
And even up till now,

217
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,354
I still cry over what happened to him

218
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,649
and your elder brother, Paco.

219
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,235
Rebecca…

220
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,154
Rebecca, please…

221
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,740
I'm begging you.

222
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,078
Please don't close your heart to me.

223
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,249
Because I don't want to cry

224
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,378
over you every day, Rebecca.

225
00:13:57,461 --> 00:14:00,214
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Auntie Aurora…

226
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,551
But, I've already stated
my two conditions.

227
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,764
Take it and we're good.

228
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,975
Leave it,

229
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,395
and I will push through
with my case against you,

230
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,522
and I'll even add more to it.

231
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,652
And I will make sure
that you will rot in jail

232
00:14:22,611 --> 00:14:26,031
for the rest of your wretched life.

233
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,870
Let's go, Attorney.

234
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:47,386
Sir Amando, what will I do?

235
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,764
If Ma'am Aurora finds out
that Ma'am Sam left,

236
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,141
I'm sure I'll be in trouble.

237
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:55,227
If you don't have plans
to go AWOL before she arrives,

238
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:58,063
prepare your cheeks.

239
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:01,108
What? Are there no other options?

240
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,861
You wanted to be
Aurora's assistant, right?

241
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:07,072
Well then, you should suffer.

242
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,744
Animals.

243
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,622
I can't leave this place.

244
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,874
All my plans will be destroyed.

245
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,375
Plan?

246
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,668
What plan?

247
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,045
Plan…

248
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,005
for my family.

249
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:27,635
I can no longer find another job
that will give me the same salary as here.

250
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:31,597
I will never forget this.

251
00:15:36,644 --> 00:15:39,605
Mom, answer my call.

252
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,106
Hello, George.

253
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,484
Why did you answer just now?

254
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:46,195
Of course, I'm checking
if there's someone here.

255
00:15:46,278 --> 00:15:48,906
Sam started going into labor earlier.

256
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:51,200
She could give birth at any time.

257
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:55,162
Well, then I can see my grandson?

258
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,497
Yes, Mom.

259
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:59,583
That's why you had better leave
that place now.

260
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:01,543
<i>Oh, my. Okay.</i>

261
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:03,671
But, I'm not done packing yet.

262
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:07,091
Mom, don't bring too many things.

263
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:12,304
Just get our passports in the folder
with the other important documents.

264
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,098
<i>What about Ward?</i>

265
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,433
We haven't told him anything yet.
What about him?

266
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:18,268
Mom, you take care of him.

267
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,980
What's important is for you
to leave there.

268
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:24,733
Just go directly to the airport.
The baby and I will wait for you there.

269
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,987
I already talked to Bong.
He'll take care of the tickets.

270
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:30,698
Okay. You and the baby must be careful.

271
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:31,865
Okay, George?

272
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,578
George…

273
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:38,831
What's taking you so long?

274
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:41,417
Have you been there for a while?

275
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,095
- Mom?
- What?

276
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,847
What's the urgent matter
that you messaged me about?

277
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,640
- What's that luggage for?
- Um…

278
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,726
We're leaving now, Ward.
That's what your sister said.

279
00:16:58,809 --> 00:17:01,854
This is our trip abroad.
We need to leave right away.

280
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:03,147
What?

281
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,065
If that's the case,
I need to say goodbye to Sofia.

282
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:06,942
- We have an agreement that…
- No.

283
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,819
There's no time to say goodbye to Sofia.

284
00:17:08,902 --> 00:17:11,405
Your sister said we need to leave now.

285
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,741
What's the problem, Mom?

286
00:17:13,824 --> 00:17:17,411
Are there Palacios killings again
and George is involved?

287
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:21,331
Wait, I have Sergeant Royales' number.

288
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:22,624
I will call him right away.

289
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,877
- We need to report this to him…
- No. No need.

290
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,010
Why do you look that way?
It's as if you've seen a ghost.

291
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,888
No, I was just surprised.

292
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:37,431
The road here is steep.

293
00:17:37,514 --> 00:17:39,058
You might trip.

294
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:40,392
No.

295
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,103
You were taking so long.
You said you would just change the tires.

296
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,021
Who were you talking to?

297
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,274
Auntie Mercy.

298
00:17:47,357 --> 00:17:51,570
I asked permission from her.
I told her we were not going home tonight,

299
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:55,657
that we'd spend the night
in an eco-friendly cottage by the sea.

300
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:57,785
What did she say? Did she agree?

301
00:17:58,410 --> 00:17:59,369
Yes.

302
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,456
Good thing you called her.

303
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,416
At least, I don't have to call her.

304
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,001
My phone is still turned off.

305
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,002
Rico is annoying me.

306
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,636
Mom, what's happening?
Why do you look so scared?

307
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:18,222
You're so hard-headed.

308
00:18:18,305 --> 00:18:20,599
George said we need to leave now

309
00:18:20,682 --> 00:18:23,685
because if not,
your sister will be in danger.

310
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,814
Okay, Mom. But, I need to warn Sofia

311
00:18:26,897 --> 00:18:28,690
in case something happens
to her in the compound.

312
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,402
- I don't want her to be in danger, Mom.
- Ward…

313
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:37,699
the Palacios killer has nothing to do
with our plan of leaving this place.

314
00:18:37,783 --> 00:18:39,451
Sofia has nothing to do with this either.

315
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:41,829
So, please, Ward. Just listen.

316
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:45,040
Because if not,
your sister's life will be destroyed.

317
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,125
Our lives will be destroyed.

318
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:49,128
So, please. Just listen, okay?
Just follow us.

319
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,715
Ms. Ruth, excuse me.

320
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,050
Can I ask a question?

321
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:58,971
Since Ma'am George and Ma'am Sam
escaped from me,

322
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,597
they are no longer
answering their cellphones, so…

323
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:03,934
maybe you can call Ma'am George

324
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:06,353
and tell her
to send Ma'am Sam home, please.

325
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,980
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:09,565
But we need to leave. We're in a hurry.

327
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:10,983
We can't be late.

328
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:12,317
Come on, let's go. Bring this.

329
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,446
Ms. Ruth, Ward…

330
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:17,698
I'm sorry.

331
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:24,955
Thank you, George.

332
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:26,290
Thank you so much.

333
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,419
I'm glad you're okay with my plan.

334
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,379
Yes, of course. Why would I not be?

335
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,008
The truth is,
if it weren't for Rebecca and Mother,

336
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,635
I would've left that house
a long time ago.

337
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,846
I'm always paranoid,

338
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:42,931
not only because of the Palacios killer,

339
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,267
but also with Mom Aurora.

340
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,437
Because she's been saying for a long time

341
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,273
that once I give birth,
she will get my baby.

342
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,777
I'm ready to kill for my baby.

343
00:19:56,862 --> 00:20:02,951
But still, part of me is scared
of how far she'll go to get my baby.

344
00:20:06,788 --> 00:20:09,041
What if we extend?

345
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,627
Let's ask Auntie Ruth, Ward, and Mother
to follow us.

346
00:20:12,336 --> 00:20:13,962
Okay, but…

347
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,633
tonight it's just the two of us,
so we can bond.

348
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,177
Okay.

349
00:20:21,845 --> 00:20:23,639
George, thank you.

350
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:27,434
Thank you for taking care of me
and our baby.

351
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,193
Auntie Aurora is too shameless
to confront you.

352
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:39,154
She should be thankful
I didn't go inside Atty. Lilet's office.

353
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,619
Rebecca, you've been quiet
for some time now.

354
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,872
Do you feel guilty
about what you told her?

355
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:51,124
Yes, of course.

356
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,378
Because that was painful for me too.

357
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,714
What child would want
to reject their own parent?

358
00:20:58,215 --> 00:21:00,342
But, she committed a huge sin against you.

359
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,929
It's so huge that she deserves
to be punished under the law.

360
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,766
I wanted to tell you earlier,

361
00:21:07,849 --> 00:21:11,061
that you can't just withdraw
from a kidnapping case

362
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,689
because you're fighting for something.

363
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,440
If you withdraw,

364
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,652
you need to file an affidavit
of desistance

365
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:21,655
stating that you only had
a misapprehension of facts.

366
00:21:21,738 --> 00:21:23,282
That's why you filed a case.

367
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:27,911
But, we all know what you went through
with Ms. Aurora your whole life.

368
00:21:28,537 --> 00:21:30,455
If I could have it my way,

369
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,709
I'd continue with the fight
and let the court decide.

370
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:37,421
But, if she returns my children to me,

371
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:43,510
it seems useless for me
to continue the case against her, right?

372
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:45,679
What I want

373
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:49,224
is for her to feel the pain that I felt

374
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:53,854
at losing a child.

375
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,566
And I'm aware that she loves me.

376
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,401
She just can't stand by it.

377
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:02,821
Or she can't give it to me completely.

378
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:06,033
And if I leave her too,

379
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:09,411
she will get hurt, right?

380
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,831
Rebecca, do you think,

381
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,792
with the conditions that you gave her,

382
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,670
will she fulfill her promise
to return your children to you?

383
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,187
Rico is nagging you too.

384
00:22:36,229 --> 00:22:37,397
Just let her.

385
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,359
Why don't we answer her? I pity her.

386
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:42,861
She might get fired.

387
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:44,529
Oh, well…

388
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:49,034
If I were her,
I would be thankful as soon as I get fired

389
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:52,496
because I would no longer
experience growing old as a slave.

390
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,665
Well, you're right. Just like Amando.

391
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:00,128
George…

392
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:03,131
George, I have a feeling that I'm leaking.

393
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:05,383
It looks like something is leaking…

394
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:10,764
Attorney…

395
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,934
Do you think Aunt Aurora

396
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:16,645
will back down from her offer
to give me back my children

397
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,647
in exchange for withdrawing the case?

398
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:23,735
Well, if she doesn't want to accept
the conditions you've given her,

399
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,946
she can always take back her offer.

400
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,074
But, we can still pursue a separate case

401
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:31,493
against the person in custody
of your children,

402
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:33,120
and we can proceed
with the kidnapping case

403
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:34,329
against Miss Aurora.

404
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,082
Okay, okay, okay. That's good.

405
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:40,502
But, we'll talk about that later

406
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,963
because we're here,

407
00:23:43,046 --> 00:23:45,048
because I promised to cook
dinner for you, okay?

408
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:49,511
Okay, okay.

409
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:55,600
- Rebecca.
- Uncle Galvan.

410
00:24:02,858 --> 00:24:04,568
I missed you, Uncle.

411
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:05,986
I missed you too.

412
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,284
Aunt Larry?

413
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:14,870
Aunt Barry, you're here.

414
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,539
Yes, Rebecca.

415
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,793
They're here tell you
about their surprise for you.

416
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,969
Is the pain getting worse?

417
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,013
Yes, George, it seems…

418
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,140
It seems the pain is recurring…

419
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,184
It feels like the contractions
are one after another.

420
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,854
Just relax. Maybe you're too tense.

421
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,773
George, can we go back to the clinic?

422
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,860
We're too far away.

423
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,654
Let's just go straight
to the rest house where we're staying.

424
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,657
Doesn't it seem harder there?

425
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:58,038
You'll stay with me for now, Rebecca,

426
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,249
so you can bond with Anastasia.

427
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,796
I've also brought baby Jed there
so you can bond too.

428
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:11,801
So that way, you can establish
a relationship with one another.

429
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,770
They're my twins?

430
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,438
Yes.

431
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:27,025
We'll return the twins to you.

432
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:33,073
We'll do it little by little,
so that when they get used to you,

433
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:36,201
you can establish your own family.

434
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,164
Thank you.

435
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:06,064
I'll just ask Doctor Flores
to follow us there.

436
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,192
The important thing is,
you can lie down properly

437
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,777
so you can relax.

438
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,154
Sis, don't worry.

439
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,324
I'm a registered nurse, remember?

440
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:19,327
I know what to do
while we wait for Doctor Flores.

441
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,539
Okay, hurry up.

442
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:29,254
Thank you.

443
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,755
Thank you so much.

444
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:34,175
I thought I'd never see my children again.

445
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:36,052
I'm sorry if…

446
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,931
we're only returning the twins
to you now because…

447
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,975
you know, right?

448
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:45,061
Aurora actually begged us not to.

449
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,648
I'm really sorry, Rebecca.

450
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,858
I'll admit it.

451
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:54,696
I wanted to help Auro
because she's my friend, but when your…

452
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:59,117
good lawyer here
filed for the petition of habeas corpus,

453
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,829
I knew she wouldn't stop
until we were punished too.

454
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:04,247
So, that's it.

455
00:27:04,331 --> 00:27:07,292
Hillary got scared, but I didn't.

456
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:10,712
I'm going to give
your baby boy back to you.

457
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:16,968
I've already talked to my lawyer boyfriend
about how to go about it.

458
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:20,263
Really, Barbara?

459
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,891
Are we going to betray each other?

460
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,853
I've admitted my sin.

461
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:30,482
Well, I was just stating a fact.

462
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,566
Really?

463
00:27:31,649 --> 00:27:32,776
- Yes.
- That's enough, Aunties…

464
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:36,321
Stop, please.

465
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,240
I don't want to fight anymore.

466
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:41,701
I don't want trouble.

467
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:47,916
What's important now
is that I can finally be with my babies.

468
00:28:09,062 --> 00:28:10,730
Thank you so much.

469
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,818
I owe you so much.

470
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,571
None of this would have happened
if it weren't for you.

471
00:28:19,239 --> 00:28:21,116
Thank you very much.

472
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,454
Thank you.

473
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,499
Aurora? Wait.

474
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,378
Why, Galvan?

475
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,423
Why don't you join us inside?

476
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:20,633
For what?

477
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,721
To make me look like I lost the case?

478
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:29,601
No one would have lost and won

479
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,561
if from the start,

480
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:34,314
you had returned Rebecca's
children to her.

481
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:36,900
You even took it to court.

482
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:40,653
Nobody gets me in this house, Galvan.

483
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:46,075
I took the twins away from Rebecca

484
00:29:47,327 --> 00:29:50,872
for the safety of the children,
and Rebecca too.

485
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:56,002
A decision I made
out of love and necessity.

486
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,464
I acted in good faith, Galvan.

487
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,635
I only saved Rebecca and her children

488
00:30:03,718 --> 00:30:06,054
because of Rebecca's mental
health condition.

489
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:11,518
And don't give me that crap
that Rebecca is well.

490
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:16,773
No. It's not impossible
for her illness to come back.

491
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:20,902
Rebecca just got better, Galvan,
not even a year ago.

492
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,323
With Larry and Barry,

493
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,493
the children are secure
until they grow up.

494
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:32,330
With Rebecca, who knows what will happen?

495
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:34,624
Yes.

496
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,087
There is a chance
that Rebecca's illness will return.

497
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,757
But, what if it doesn't?

498
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,804
What if her children continue to heal her?

499
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,976
Aurora, you don't own their story.

500
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:59,524
Not all your decisions
or desires are right.

501
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,235
Let go.

502
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,153
Loosen up.

503
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,781
Let Rebecca be happy.

504
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,456
Hello?

505
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,751
Okay.

506
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,963
Give me an hour to pack my things.

507
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,424
Who's that?

508
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,427
Our helicopter pilot.

509
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:29,554
Will you run away from your case?

510
00:31:31,431 --> 00:31:37,103
Aurora, even if Rebecca withdraws,
your case can still continue.

511
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,440
I won't escape, Galvan.

512
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:46,779
I'm flying to our private island
in Palawan.

513
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,865
I just want to breathe.

514
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,536
Then I will go with you.

515
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,541
For what? To watch over me
and make sure I won't escape?

516
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,542
No.

517
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,588
To make sure you don't harm yourself.

518
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,925
I don't want you
to lose control of yourself.

519
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:10,011
You might do something again.

520
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,016
Paco, my son.

521
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,893
Son, where are you?

522
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:19,604
Mom needs you. Paco, where are you?

523
00:32:19,687 --> 00:32:20,730
- Don't!
- Paco…

524
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,149
- Ma'am Aurora, don't.
- Paco!

525
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,902
- Aurora.
- Where are you, son?

526
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,739
Give me back my son.

527
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,532
Bring him out.

528
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:38,915
Aurora…

529
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:44,212
Believe it or not…

530
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:47,632
I care for you.

531
00:32:47,715 --> 00:32:49,175
I don't want you to die.

532
00:32:51,010 --> 00:32:54,430
Because our fight is not fair

533
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,641
if you die.

534
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,352
So, now…

535
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,063
whether you like it or not,

536
00:33:03,773 --> 00:33:05,900
I'm coming with you to Palawan.

537
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:35,054
My God…

538
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:37,598
Sam, what time is it?

539
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,815
<i>I'm sorry. The subscriber</i>
<i>cannot be reached.</i>

540
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:47,775
<i>Please try again later.</i>

541
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:50,194
<i>I'm sorry. The subscriber</i>
<i>cannot be reached.</i>

542
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:51,863
<i>Please try again later.</i>

543
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,534
Why is the answer always like that?

544
00:33:57,577 --> 00:34:02,081
Rebecca's trial court
is only in Metro Manila.

545
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,584
Besides, it's late already.

546
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:07,420
It's impossible that the hearing
is still ongoing.

547
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:08,838
Oh my, Sam…

548
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:12,550
Where are you?
Maybe something happened to you.

549
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:27,523
George…

550
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,942
I'm going to give birth anytime.

551
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,445
But, don't worry. I'm here.

552
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:33,905
I won't leave you.

553
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,990
George, call Doctor Flores.

554
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,241
She won't make it to the rest house.

555
00:34:37,325 --> 00:34:39,494
And can we just go back to Manila?

556
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,287
I'd rather give birth there, George.

557
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:42,622
It's safer there.

558
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,998
Wait. Where's my cellphone?

559
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,917
Where did I drop it? I plugged it in…

560
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,168
I can't find it.

561
00:34:47,251 --> 00:34:50,296
Here, use this. Use my cellphone.

562
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,425
Sis, you have no signal.

563
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:55,843
Oh, my God…

564
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,763
- George…
- I need to find my cellphone.

565
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,431
Maybe my phone has signal.

566
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:02,600
George, it hurts so much.

567
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:09,315
- Good evening, ma'am.
- Ando?

568
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:12,110
- Yes, ma'am?
- Your Ma'am Sam, why isn't she here yet?

569
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:13,694
Didn't you drive to get her?

570
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:17,573
Well, ma'am, Ma'am Sam didn't want me
to drive for her.

571
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:20,451
She said she and Ma'am George
can take care of themselves.

572
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:21,577
What?

573
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:24,831
The reason Ma'am Aurora hired you
is because there's a Palacios killer.

574
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:29,252
Even if George has a bodyguard,
you should still escort my daughter.

575
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:34,966
Better yet, ask Bill
where he and Ma'am George are.

576
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,844
Well, ma'am, he has no idea.

577
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:40,221
Ma'am George didn't let him
go with them either.

578
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,184
It was just her and Ma'am Sam who left.

579
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:50,231
What? Do you mean
the two of them left without security?

580
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,526
Ma'am, I'll go ahead.

581
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,737
If you need anything, just call me.

582
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,156
I'm sorry.

583
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,293
I already texted Doc even though
I didn't have a signal.

584
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:13,129
Let's go back to the clinic,
I'm begging you.

585
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:16,048
Sam, we're too far away.

586
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:18,301
If we go back to Manila,

587
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:21,137
you might deliver on the way.

588
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,472
If we go straight to the rest house
you can give birth there.

589
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,141
We won't have any problems.

590
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:27,560
Sis, don't worry.

591
00:36:28,227 --> 00:36:29,896
If Doc doesn't make it,

592
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:31,606
I know what to do.

593
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:37,278
I have experience in childbirth
when I was on duty as a nurse.

594
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:39,238
I've already delivered a baby.

595
00:36:39,739 --> 00:36:43,034
I will protect you and your baby,
and you know I'm true to my word.

596
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:46,913
We're not even close, remember.
I've already protected you.

597
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:50,416
Are those your friends?

598
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,836
My batchmates in the sorority.

599
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:56,464
Girl, if you're going
to have some sis like them,

600
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,257
never mind, don't do it.

601
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,885
Sisterhood should be
about protecting each other,

602
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:02,303
not destroying one another.

603
00:37:02,386 --> 00:37:04,722
I don't have any friends on campus.

604
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,766
Well, you have one now.

605
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,351
Georgina.

606
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:09,310
Sam.

607
00:37:11,187 --> 00:37:13,272
And from then on, we were inseparable.

608
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,108
Sisters for life.

609
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:19,654
Matching, really?

610
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,614
<i>How cute is that.</i>

611
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,116
<i>Don't you like it?</i>
<i>We're like twin sisters.</i>

612
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:44,136
We even have an official theme song,
do you remember that?

613
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:49,308
Of course. You know,
it's still number one on my playlist.

614
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:52,186
That's what stopped me when…

615
00:38:08,327 --> 00:38:10,413
Did you attempt suicide or something?

616
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,040
George…

617
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,008
- Ward?
- Mom.

618
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,344
Oh, did you put our bags in the car?

619
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,887
Yes, Mom. They're already in the car.

620
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:30,683
Sir Galvan's guests are annoying.

621
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:33,602
If they had left earlier,
we would have escaped earlier.

622
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,479
Escape?

623
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,066
Us? Why are we escaping, Mom?

624
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,193
Who are we escaping from?

625
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:44,030
<i>I won't sue Sam.</i>

626
00:38:44,113 --> 00:38:46,782
I'll make her believe
that we're okay again.

627
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:49,493
And when I regain her trust,

628
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,620
it'll be easier for me to get the baby

629
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:53,414
when she gives birth.

630
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:57,793
Shouldn't we tell Ward
about our plan to escape

631
00:38:58,294 --> 00:38:59,670
with Sam's baby?

632
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:02,006
But, sometimes Ward fails.

633
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,675
He can't keep a secret for long.

634
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,093
Yes, you're right.

635
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,095
Besides, this is too much for him.

636
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,138
He might not be able to handle it.

637
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,976
Mom, what's wrong with you and George?

638
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:15,603
Why are we escaping?

639
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,147
What? Escape?

640
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:20,858
Who said we were escaping?

641
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:22,693
You.

642
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:25,780
You said, if only Sir Galvan's
guests' cars hadn't blocked us,

643
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,406
we would have escaped sooner.

644
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,784
Oh.

645
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,661
We're not escaping.
I mean we could've gotten out.

646
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,664
I said, if their cars hadn't blocked us,

647
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,876
we would have gotten out earlier
and gone to your sister.

648
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,842
What? Are we going straight
to the rest house?

649
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,677
George…

650
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,138
It hurts. It really hurts.

651
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:53,974
My contractions are getting
a little longer.

652
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,935
It hurts. It hurts so much.

653
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:58,020
George, I'm scared.

654
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,605
What's with you?

655
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:02,608
Have faith in yourself.

656
00:40:02,691 --> 00:40:04,151
You're such a fighter.

657
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,570
Even a drunkard in the bar
doesn't stand a chance against you.

658
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,240
Do you remember?
You even fought with the best friend

659
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:10,991
of my date at the bar?

660
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:14,829
I'm bored.

661
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,790
There's a motel nearby.

662
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:19,291
Let's take a break?

663
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,669
You're rude.

664
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:22,837
You're playing too hard to get.

665
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,547
- Hey, hey, hey.
- You're so shameless.

666
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,549
You were something else at that time, Sis.

667
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,384
You're such an Amazon.

668
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,470
It's you.

669
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,264
You're braver than me.

670
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:36,016
Even though you have a love life,

671
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,270
you let it get ruined just to defend me.

672
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:41,772
You're the rude one.

673
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:44,024
- You're rude.
- Hey.

674
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,568
That's what suits you.

675
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,238
We're really a perfect tandem, aren't we?

676
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,782
Neither of us will give up.

677
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:53,367
We're both fighters.

678
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:56,704
That's why I know we can do this.

679
00:40:56,787 --> 00:41:00,833
Even if it's just the two of us,
we can deliver your baby.

680
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,170
George… it hurts so much.

681
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:10,342
Okay, okay, let's go.

682
00:41:10,426 --> 00:41:12,344
George… George, come on.

683
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:13,679
Let's go to the rest house.

684
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:16,265
- Come on, come on, come on.
- This is it, come on. Let's go.

685
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,645
- Oh, no.
- What happened?

686
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:25,691
I think the battery got discharged.

687
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:30,404
I turned off the engine, but I left
the air-conditioning and the lights on.

688
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:35,075
What? We have no signal.
The car won't start, George?

689
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,203
I'm so sorry, Sis.

690
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:39,163
But, don't worry.

691
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:42,124
I saw a nearby structure
that we could stop at.

692
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,043
George, I didn't see any houses.

693
00:41:44,126 --> 00:41:46,462
We've been driving for a while.

694
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,255
Yes, I saw something.

695
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,424
It's just near here. I'll take you there.

696
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,843
Let's take it easy.
We'll get there in time.

697
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:56,972
George…

698
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,643
George, my water just broke.

699
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:08,484
<i>I need to deliver your baby, Sam</i>

700
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,487
<i>because I'll be the one</i>
<i>to take your child later.</i>

701
00:42:16,408 --> 00:42:21,914
It looks like Miss George and Sir Galvan
have an evil plan for Miss Sam.

702
00:42:22,498 --> 00:42:26,043
<i>That's why Sir Galvan</i>
<i>accompanied Ma'am Aurora to Palawan</i>

703
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,921
<i>to make sure she can't go home</i>

704
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:31,090
<i>until Miss Sam gives birth.</i>

705
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:34,301
Mom, why do we have fake IDs?

706
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,303
<i>Many people are angry with the Palacios,</i>

707
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:39,640
so a lot of people could be
the suspect for masterminds.

708
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,726
Maybe you already know.

709
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,144
You're just not telling me.
