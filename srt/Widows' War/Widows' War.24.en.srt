1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,177
<i>So let me help you, George.</i>

2
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,513
<i>I will help you pay Sam back</i>
<i>for what she did to us.</i>

3
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:57,140
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:00:57,223 --> 00:00:58,224
Sam!

5
00:00:58,850 --> 00:00:59,809
Sam, my child.

6
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:02,062
Sam! Sam, my child.

7
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,064
Someone was stabbing you.

8
00:01:04,147 --> 00:01:05,774
Just like what happened to Beverly.

9
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,068
Mother, stop crying. It was just a dream.

10
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,819
I followed your orders, madam.

11
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:11,905
Any evidence of the fact that
Ma'am Rebecca got pregnant,

12
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,989
I turned into ashes.

13
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:17,660
Make sure that there are no other copies
of that picture of Rebecca.

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,747
- Why did you stop?
- I saw someone.

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,916
Ma'am Rebecca, what are you doing here?

16
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,501
- I saw someone there.
- Go and check.

17
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,044
Why are your clothes on the floor?

18
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,337
I will tidy them.

19
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:30,840
Mother?

20
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,008
What happened, Mother?

21
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:35,011
Isn't that the knife that was used
to kill Beverly?

22
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,304
- Was it a success?
- Yes, Mother.

23
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:38,932
That's good to hear!
I've been so worried this whole time.

24
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:40,183
I'll call Sergeant Villa.

25
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,352
He needs to see the knife in Sam's things.

26
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,271
We need to dispose of that, Mother.
We need to dispose of it.

27
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:47,315
<i>You're now caught red-handed, Sam.</i>

28
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:48,983
<i>You want to dispose of the evidence?</i>

29
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,860
Jail will be waiting for you, Sam.

30
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,153
What's going on here?

31
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:53,655
Someone gave the detective a tip.

32
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:56,407
Someone saw Sam burying
something here last night.

33
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,368
Sam! Did you bury something there?

34
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,995
Sir, negative. We didn't find
anything buried here.

35
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,623
Who gave you the tip,
and why did you believe it?

36
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,792
I can't tell you who our source is.

37
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:07,168
But our source sent a video.

38
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:09,712
<i>So it's true.</i>
<i>You did bury something here.</i>

39
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:12,215
I thought of burying the murder weapon.

40
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:15,176
But while I was doing it,
I changed my mind.

41
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,261
Why did you change your mind?

42
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:18,346
Because I know it's
a strong piece of evidence

43
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,515
that could lead to finding out
who killed Beverly

44
00:02:20,598 --> 00:02:22,934
and also help with solving Basil's case.

45
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:29,524
Ms. Samantha, please take note.

46
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:35,655
Basil Palacios' and Beverly Maison's cases
are totally separate cases.

47
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:40,243
Sergeant, I believe that the same person
killed Basil and Beverly.

48
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:41,870
That's your opinion.

49
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,958
Anyways, for now, let's focus on you.

50
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:51,296
Because now, we will be investigating you.

51
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,397
Ms. Mercy,

52
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,110
where did you find the knife
in front of you right now?

53
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:21,326
Oh!

54
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,455
In Sam's laundry hamper
when I was tidying her things.

55
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,042
Where were you at that time, Ms. Samantha?

56
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:33,463
I was tidying the bed because Mother
and I were about to sleep

57
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,131
when I heard her scream.

58
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,258
Mother, what's happened?

59
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,426
What's that?

60
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,761
- What?
- There's…

61
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,686
Hey, you two!

62
00:03:49,187 --> 00:03:50,438
Both of you are useless!

63
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,816
I assigned you here to guard Sam!

64
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:58,071
How did someone get inside her room?

65
00:04:01,115 --> 00:04:02,283
Mercy!

66
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:05,995
What were they doing at the time?

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,709
They were sleeping.

68
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,970
Both of you,

69
00:04:22,553 --> 00:04:24,681
get out of my face!

70
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,765
Now!

71
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,894
Stupid!

72
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,028
Madam, here's the CCTV footage.

73
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,626
Detective, we have CCTV footage.

74
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,128
Show them, Amando.

75
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,298
We have footage, but it's all shadows.

76
00:05:01,592 --> 00:05:06,764
But that still means something,
right, Detective?

77
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:09,058
Whoever that is,

78
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,478
they intentionally avoided
the CCTV camera.

79
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,106
He was good at avoiding the CCTV.

80
00:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,066
Just like the person who killed Beverly,

81
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:21,446
he knows where all the CCTVs are placed
inside the estate.

82
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,952
I actually saw someone last night.

83
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:34,292
Over there, quite far away.

84
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,046
But the thing is, I was far, so…

85
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,548
I wasn't able to see who the person was.

86
00:05:40,631 --> 00:05:41,549
But…

87
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,011
I saw someone watching outside.

88
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:47,680
Me too.

89
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:49,599
I saw it too.

90
00:05:50,349 --> 00:05:52,101
Were you two together last night?

91
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,273
No, Uncle.

92
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,818
Well…

93
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,112
we have video footage and witness accounts

94
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:08,534
that may confirm that someone is lurking
near the guest room last night,

95
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:13,873
and that someone might have left
that evidence there.

96
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,628
Attorney, for all we know,
someone may have just passed by.

97
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,800
Well, can I ask for a copy
of the CCTV footage

98
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:28,346
and the eyewitness statement
for further investigation?

99
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,116
Why are you looking at Jerico that way?

100
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,619
He's a bit suspicious, Mother.

101
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:55,498
He said he saw the person
outside our room last night.

102
00:06:56,541 --> 00:07:00,336
But earlier, I saw him looking at
the window outside our room.

103
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:02,255
As if he was hiding something.

104
00:07:04,298 --> 00:07:05,508
Jerico.

105
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,517
And then, when I called out his name,
he ran away.

106
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,737
What, DJ?

107
00:07:29,365 --> 00:07:31,993
Okay, it's up to you
if you don't want to come back.

108
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:36,873
He got scared.

109
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,793
He doesn't want to come back because
there have been a lot of killings here.

110
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:52,180
Someone planted the knife
in Ms. Sam's room.

111
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:53,598
The killer.

112
00:07:55,433 --> 00:07:58,060
They saw someone on the CCTV,
but it was just their shadow.

113
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,484
Damn.

114
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,153
The real killer is right here
inside the estate.

115
00:08:07,236 --> 00:08:08,613
That's right.

116
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:12,158
Don't even dare…

117
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:13,951
If that killer dares to try
and come near me,

118
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,662
I'll send them first to hell.

119
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:27,798
What happened?
You said you'd be careful.

120
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,094
Why did the CCTV capture it?
Why did someone see you?

121
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,495
You seem to be awfully quiet, Sam.

122
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,705
Is there anything you're not telling me?

123
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,591
I think I know who the killer is.

124
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,679
I just don't have any proof yet.

125
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,977
And I also know who sent the video
to Sergeant Villa.

126
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,691
Excuse me, Attorney.

127
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,950
George?

128
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,289
Can we talk?

129
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,059
Bro, are you okay?

130
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,687
Bro,

131
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:08,691
help me get the reward money
from Sir Galvan.

132
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,068
He's such a jerk.

133
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:14,363
He doesn't know how to keep
his end of the deal.

134
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,782
He already rejected you, right?

135
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,160
Who knows?

136
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,456
Maybe he'll give it to us
if we both talk to him.

137
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:25,833
Come on.

138
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,835
Help me, Jerico.

139
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,298
I'm sorry, bro.

140
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,091
But I don't want Sir Galvan
to get mad at me.

141
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,386
Why are you no longer interested?

142
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:41,432
Because you're going to tell them
that you're a Palacios?

143
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:45,144
Are you no longer interested in the money
because you're about to get rich?

144
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:50,316
It was you who sent the video
to Sergeant Villa.

145
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,779
Watch your mouth, Sam.

146
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,280
You don't have proof.

147
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,990
You think you're so good at hiding?

148
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,742
I saw you!

149
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,055
Wouldn't you have done the same?

150
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,306
Someone got killed.

151
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,475
You saw someone burying something.

152
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:26,602
Wouldn't you be suspicious?

153
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:27,978
Your intention was different.

154
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:29,605
You wanted to frame me.

155
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:32,233
Bro, it's not that.

156
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,568
But of course…

157
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,737
Brother, I found Papa's address book…

158
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:41,492
Sorry.

159
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,703
I can see you're talking about something.

160
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,289
I'll just go back.

161
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:52,920
"Brother."

162
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:57,383
She called you her brother?

163
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,346
I don't have to frame you

164
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:05,683
because it was you who stabbed Beverly.

165
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,854
You tried to get rid of the murder weapon,
but I saw you burying it.

166
00:12:09,937 --> 00:12:12,064
And now, you're making it look like
someone planted it…

167
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,984
- George, someone is framing me.
- …in your room.

168
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,112
The real killer,
and that's who I want to find.

169
00:12:18,195 --> 00:12:21,574
And that's what you should do too.
Look for the killer.

170
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:24,118
Especially the one
who really killed your husband.

171
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,078
So, you told her already?

172
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,373
You've already told Ma'am Rebecca
that you're a Palacios.

173
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:33,002
So that's why you're no longer interested
in the reward from Sir Galvan?!

174
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:34,503
What?

175
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:37,339
Bro, wait.

176
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,507
Let me explain.

177
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:40,551
Only Rebecca knows.

178
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,094
I haven't told anyone else.

179
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,179
Okay.

180
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,097
Fine.

181
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:47,725
Well then,

182
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:51,520
let's just tell all of them
that you're a Palacios!

183
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,396
Hey!

184
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,525
I don't have to look for them
because Francis is already in jail.

185
00:12:56,609 --> 00:13:00,112
Your brother poisoned my husband
and you stabbed Beverly.

186
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:02,114
No, George, no.

187
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,950
Whoever poisoned Basil

188
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,454
is the same person who killed Beverly.

189
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,248
And who could that be, Sam?

190
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,374
Who?

191
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,376
Jerico.

192
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,920
You fool!

193
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,132
What?

194
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,635
Answer me!

195
00:13:22,718 --> 00:13:24,178
You're scared, right?

196
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:30,351
The moment anyone finds out that
I'm a Palacios,

197
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,353
I will kill you.

198
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,524
He could be Basil and Beverly's killer.

199
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,817
Go ahead, Sam!

200
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,904
Keep pointing your fingers
at other people.

201
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:43,781
George, didn't it cross your mind?

202
00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:45,658
He is mad at your husband.

203
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,243
Basil aimed a gun at him.

204
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,704
And you, you even accused him, remember?

205
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,791
Basil aimed his gun at you!

206
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,086
That's why you got mad at him!
You have a motive!

207
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,171
This is your revenge!

208
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:00,839
You poisoned Basil!

209
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:03,717
- You poisoned my husband!
- Calm down.

210
00:14:03,801 --> 00:14:06,095
And he is a traitor, George.

211
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,681
He told Uncle Galvan that
you were in the hospital.

212
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,849
He reported you. Him and Peter.

213
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,268
They reported you.

214
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,938
Maybe your mother and Ward
told you about it?

215
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:18,691
I will kill you.

216
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:20,025
You'll kill me right away?

217
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:21,694
Why?

218
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,988
Are you a killer?

219
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,662
Or maybe you were the one who killed…

220
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:34,540
What about Beverly?

221
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,083
What was his motive for that?

222
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,172
That's what I want to find out.

223
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,675
Then investigate him.

224
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,760
I will only believe if you can prove

225
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,805
that it was Jerico
who committed both crimes.

226
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,021
Hey, what's wrong with the both of you?

227
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:58,522
Stop that!

228
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,611
What's happening with the two of you?

229
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,322
You better behave.

230
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:08,741
Otherwise, I will fire you both!

231
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,368
This place is already a mess
and you're adding to it!

232
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,001
Why are you fighting?

233
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,462
It's this jerk!

234
00:15:22,713 --> 00:15:26,091
He refuses to go with me to get
the reward from Sir Galvan.

235
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,969
You're both fools.

236
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,512
Go talk it out!

237
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:34,224
We're the only allies we all have here.

238
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,893
Go and patch things up.

239
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:38,354
Unless

240
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,189
you want to kill each other.

241
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:42,232
Do you want that?

242
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,777
Whatever. Do what you want.

243
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:59,333
Could those two have killed
Sir Basil and Ms. Beverly?

244
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,376
What do you think?

245
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,844
Omeng, stop bothering me.

246
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:12,763
Okay.

247
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:16,183
I'll talk to the person who owes me.

248
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,102
I'll collect the payment.

249
00:16:18,185 --> 00:16:19,478
Okay.

250
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:34,785
Pa, please keep Basil's collection
of watches in your safety deposit box.

251
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:36,996
Some people come and go
in and out of the estate.

252
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:41,125
I mean, someone might sneak in.
I just want to be safe.

253
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,586
Okay. I'll bring them
when I go to the bank.

254
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:47,715
Thank you.

255
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:16,785
What do you want?

256
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:19,413
Is this still about the reward money?

257
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,123
Reward money?

258
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,252
It's nothing, George.

259
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,713
Go away.

260
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:30,257
You won't get anything from me.

261
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,550
I said, go away!

262
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,844
Okay.

263
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,765
- Francis, why do you look that way?
- Francis?

264
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,559
What happened to you?
What did you do to my brother?

265
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,229
He got involved in a riot, ma'am.

266
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,356
What? And you didn't do anything?!

267
00:18:27,439 --> 00:18:30,234
Tell your brother
not to get involved in riots.

268
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:32,152
Sam.

269
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,113
That's enough. Just sit down.

270
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,989
- Sit down, Sam.
- Francis.

271
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,241
Sit down.

272
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,578
- Francis, son.
- Francis…

273
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:45,541
Are you okay?

274
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,877
I'm okay, Sam.

275
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:53,674
Well, I'm getting used to it.

276
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,385
Actually, I'm ready.

277
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,512
Ready for what, Francis?

278
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,932
I'm ready to die.

279
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,939
Francis, don't talk that way.

280
00:19:09,022 --> 00:19:10,774
That's where I'll end up.

281
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,943
That's why I've accepted it.

282
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,445
I have cancer, right?

283
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:17,197
I'll end up that way.

284
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:19,032
I will eventually die.

285
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,536
There's still hope.

286
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:26,748
Don't be like that.

287
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:30,002
Your sister and I will still find a way.

288
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,424
Francis…

289
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:22,471
Aren't the colors too bright?

290
00:20:23,889 --> 00:20:26,141
Well, it was Rebecca's idea.

291
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,811
Yeah.

292
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,607
I want to celebrate my father
as if he were alive.

293
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,444
Oh, yeah.

294
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:40,197
It looks really nice.

295
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:41,490
Thank you.

296
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,868
Pa, Geraldine wants you to approve
the photos we'll use for the AVP.

297
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:46,703
Sure.

298
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:59,174
Peter, kindly queue the AVP, please.

299
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,348
When did the setup start?

300
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,767
Just today. Almost done.
Ready for tomorrow.

301
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:33,458
I wasn't able to contact any numbers
in Papa's address book.

302
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,419
Everything's outdated.

303
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,089
I will just go to the addresses.

304
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,721
Have you talked to Peter?

305
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:54,521
Jerico, please.

306
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:59,276
Let's tell Uncle and Auntie
that you're a Palacios.

307
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,195
Because

308
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:06,366
otherwise Peter might beat you to it
and tell everyone.

309
00:22:06,867 --> 00:22:08,827
He won't do that.

310
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,370
He's scared of me.

311
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:17,878
Where is Rebecca?

312
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,965
I think she went to the restroom.
But it's okay.

313
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,842
Basil's AVP will be shown first.

314
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:25,635
Okay.

315
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:29,848
Let's see Basil's first

316
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:31,767
while Rebecca is still not around.

317
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:32,893
No, it's okay.

318
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,394
Let's just play it again later.

319
00:23:05,383 --> 00:23:06,760
Where's Rebecca?

320
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:19,731
What's going on here?

321
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:44,714
Why were you hugging my niece?

322
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:49,177
Is something going on
between the two of you?

323
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,804
Auntie, no!

324
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:53,140
Ma'am Aurora,
I'm not courting Ma'am Rebecca.

325
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,641
And you shouldn't be!

326
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:57,144
You're just a household help!

327
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,981
Don't you dare come near Rebecca!

328
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,524
- Sir, no!
- Come here!

329
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,442
- Rebecca!
- Come here!

330
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,735
- Come here!
- No.

331
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:06,653
No, no!

332
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,613
- Cairo, beat him up!
- No, Uncle!

333
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,699
He's my…

334
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:20,250
Yes, Attorney.

335
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,545
I'm looking for evidence against Jerico.

336
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,464
Thank you.

337
00:24:42,022 --> 00:24:43,815
<i>Whoever poisoned Basil</i>

338
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:47,068
<i>is the same person who killed Beverly.</i>

339
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,572
<i>And who could that be, Sam?</i>

340
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:51,573
<i>Who?</i>

341
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,866
<i>Jerico.</i>

342
00:24:57,579 --> 00:24:58,830
He's my best friend!

343
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,334
He's my best friend, Auntie.

344
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:05,170
Uncle, please, no, don't hurt Jerico.

345
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:07,380
Auntie, please,
he's just like a brother to me.

346
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,174
- No. Don't go near him.
- No!

347
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,634
- No!
- Rebecca!

348
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:12,552
What are you waiting for?
Beat him up!

349
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,179
Jerico!

350
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:15,972
- No!
- Rebecca!

351
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,016
- Rebecca!
- Auntie, stop! No!

352
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,226
Stop!

353
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,520
You stop.

354
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:28,068
Please don't hurt Jerico.

355
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:29,611
Stop it.

356
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:31,321
Stop it.

357
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:32,197
Stop.

358
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:36,243
I want Jerico.

359
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,204
Don't hurt Jerico.

360
00:25:40,497 --> 00:25:43,667
Don't hurt Jerico.

361
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:59,975
You said you'd be careful.

362
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:04,020
Why did the CCTV capture it?
Why did someone see you?

363
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,451
Ward.

364
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,663
What's wrong?

365
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,040
Nothing.

366
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,009
I told Louie about what happened to Sam,

367
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:38,221
and they want to help find out
who set her up.

368
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,432
What?

369
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,519
I'll pass on that.

370
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,648
Don't you want to know who set up Sam?

371
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,615
Okay.

372
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:00,869
I'll join the investigation
of the Crimebusters.

373
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:27,580
Stay away from the help, Rebecca.

374
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:30,583
Do you have a fetish for them
or something?

375
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:31,751
No!

376
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,712
No, I don't have a thing for him, Auntie.

377
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,841
Yes, we're close.

378
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,802
Okay? But not on a romantic level.

379
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:43,221
You know what?
We can just fire him, Aurora.

380
00:28:43,304 --> 00:28:44,806
No!

381
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,641
You can't do that!

382
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,185
You don't have the right to do that!

383
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,687
We're his boss!

384
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,606
We have all the right
to terminate his employment!

385
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,191
No!

386
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:56,776
Auntie, please!

387
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,904
I lost Nurse Angie.

388
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,574
She hasn't come back.

389
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:05,285
Please, not this time.

390
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,662
Not Jerico.

391
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,373
Please, Auntie, I promise.

392
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:14,586
I promise,
he is just like a brother to me.

393
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:17,005
The same with him.

394
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:20,759
He only treats me like a sister.

395
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:30,685
Very well.

396
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:33,813
But just one hint

397
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,900
that Jerico is interested in you,

398
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,110
and I will kick him out.

399
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:03,635
Rebecca…

400
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,846
don't worry about Angie.

401
00:30:07,305 --> 00:30:09,349
I've already found a replacement for her.

402
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:12,602
Amando.

403
00:30:16,397 --> 00:30:17,440
It's okay.

404
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:26,574
Ma'am Rebecca, this is Loray.
Your new nanny.

405
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:28,535
Nanny?

406
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,997
What am I, five?

407
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:35,750
Gosh.

408
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:46,177
Loray, don't worry about my niece.

409
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,887
She'll come around.

410
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,764
Just take good care of her

411
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:53,893
and make sure that she takes
her meds on time.

412
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:54,853
Yes, ma'am.

413
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:58,147
Also, I'm used to taking care of
people like Ma'am Rebecca.

414
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:03,319
What do you mean by, "You're used
to taking care of people like Rebecca"?

415
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,530
Are you insinuating something?

416
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,282
No, ma'am.

417
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,200
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- Loray.

418
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,702
I'll take you to your room.

419
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,250
I followed your orders, madam.

420
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:19,586
Not only the pictures

421
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:23,089
but any evidence of the fact that
Ma'am Rebecca got pregnant,

422
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,257
I turned into ashes.

423
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,356
Larry.

424
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,650
How are you, my dear?

425
00:31:44,444 --> 00:31:45,778
How's the kid?

426
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,365
Can we meet?

427
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,346
I just need to go somewhere.

428
00:32:53,429 --> 00:32:54,222
Okay.

429
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,723
Come back soon.

430
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:02,605
Hi! Are you for Basil or for Papa?

431
00:33:02,689 --> 00:33:04,816
Oh, you must be Rebecca?

432
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:06,025
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

433
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,735
I'm here for your papa.

434
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:09,028
I'm his old colleague.

435
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,613
- Really?
- Yeah.

436
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:12,657
That's great, sir.

437
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:14,409
Kindly sign up and put down
your contact details.

438
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:15,618
Okay.

439
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,334
Thank you.

440
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,598
Peter.

441
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:39,767
- Sir?
- Cairo.

442
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:40,685
Jerico.

443
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,314
She's our new driver, Rochelle.

444
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:46,941
I prefer Rico.

445
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:50,111
- What?
- You can just call me Rico.

446
00:33:50,194 --> 00:33:51,696
Okay, this is Rico.

447
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,574
Your new co-worker, and DJ's replacement.

448
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,492
Hi, I'm Rico.

449
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,493
Rico.

450
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,495
- Nice to meet you.
- Cairo.

451
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,290
Where are you from, Rico?

452
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,499
I'm from Davao.

453
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:06,878
Rico from Davao?

454
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,547
Okay, guys. Nice to meet you.

455
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:10,673
All right.

456
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,385
All right.

457
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,650
Sir Paco hasn't been dead
even 40 days yet,

458
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,070
and we're already holding
a novena for Sir Basil.

459
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,239
Then we also have Ms. Beverly.

460
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,289
Good thing Sir Basil's case
has already been solved.

461
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,500
Francis is already in jail.

462
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:47,710
His soul will be at peace.

463
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,674
Sir, be careful.

464
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:55,218
You might fall, sir.

465
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,011
Sorry.

466
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,978
I'm so glad I have you in my life, Peter.

467
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:07,897
What would I do without you?

468
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,527
Sir, you're my favorite boss

469
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,070
because you're kind.

470
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,202
If all my exes were like you,

471
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:25,581
I'd be one happy man.

472
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:42,431
I'm sorry, sir.

473
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:45,685
It's okay.

474
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,895
Maybe…

475
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:50,857
Maybe this is where you're supposed to be.

476
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:13,689
What the hell do you think you're doing?

477
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,691
- Sir, you said--
- What did I say?

478
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,653
- Sir, I thought--
- What did you think?

479
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,657
Do you think I'd fall for you?

480
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,368
I am a Palacios.

481
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:28,788
I am the next CEO of our company.

482
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,499
I don't sleep with the help.

483
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,921
Did you really think I'd fall for you?

484
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,465
And then what? Give you money?

485
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:43,177
I would sponsor someone like you?

486
00:37:47,473 --> 00:37:49,392
Know your place here, Peter.

487
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,895
<i>You're nothing but the help.</i>

488
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,114
Sir Basil's soul will now be at peace.

489
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,201
Maybe the two had a serious fight,

490
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,746
and that's why Francis poisoned Sir Basil.

491
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,290
It's not just a serious fight.

492
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,169
Your boss was a fool.

493
00:38:59,712 --> 00:39:01,547
That's why a lot of people hated him.

494
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,633
He deserved it.

495
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:06,552
Peter…

496
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,513
Are you mad at Sir Basil?

497
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,683
Maybe it was you who poisoned him.

498
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,310
No.

499
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,107
I'm just the help.

500
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:22,234
A driver.

501
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:30,284
What is it to me if Sir Basil dies,
or any of the Palacios family?

502
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:31,744
Why?

503
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,664
Will I inherit something from them?

504
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:39,043
Will I get money?

505
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,130
Will I get rich?

506
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,050
No, right?

507
00:39:47,927 --> 00:39:50,012
I don't know with you, Peter.

508
00:39:50,096 --> 00:39:52,014
You have a lot of angst.

509
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,548
This is George.

510
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,759
Nice to meet you, Uncle.

511
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,594
Likewise, dear.

512
00:40:31,887 --> 00:40:32,763
So, son…

513
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,224
Is she the one?

514
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,520
I don't know.

515
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,397
That's up to George.

516
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:44,608
Me? But you haven't asked me yet.

517
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,361
That's right. I forgot.

518
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,321
Excuse me, Uncle.

519
00:40:49,405 --> 00:40:50,781
Love, restroom, please?

520
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,617
Down the hall, to your left.
The powder room's there.

521
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,411
Thank you. Excuse me.

522
00:41:01,041 --> 00:41:02,293
Who is she?

523
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:04,503
A Lopez?

524
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:05,754
A Royales?

525
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,384
A Balay.

526
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,720
A what?

527
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,182
Don't tell me she's a nobody.

528
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,351
What does it matter
what family she's from?

529
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:24,273
Once I marry this woman,
she'll be a Palacios.

530
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,151
Our children will be a Palacios.

531
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,986
So what does it matter?
Isn't this what you wanted?

532
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,613
Of course, it would matter to me.

533
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,781
Most especially to your Auntie Aurora!

534
00:41:34,116 --> 00:41:35,993
You're a Palacios, for God's sake!

535
00:41:36,577 --> 00:41:38,996
- You should be marrying someone who's…
- I should be marrying who?

536
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,040
Tell me.

537
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:41,999
Who?

538
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,835
Don't compare me to yourself.

539
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:48,714
I don't follow the orders of this family.

540
00:41:49,548 --> 00:41:51,717
I make my own decisions.

541
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,970
So you either accept this woman
as your daughter-in-law,

542
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,305
and our children,

543
00:41:57,264 --> 00:41:59,558
or you can find your gun
and shoot me right now.

544
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:10,486
Sir…

545
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:17,243
How many times do I have to tell you?

546
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:21,664
Sir, I didn't come here for the reward.

547
00:42:22,414 --> 00:42:25,876
I came here to sympathize with you.

548
00:42:37,388 --> 00:42:40,683
The Palacios men are dying one by one.

549
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:44,895
Paco, Basil…

550
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,023
and my grandson.

551
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:49,858
All of them are gone.

552
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:52,611
Sam's child is the only one left,

553
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:55,531
but the baby isn't born yet.

554
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:00,286
Sir, there's one left.

555
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:01,745
There's still one left.

556
00:43:04,790 --> 00:43:06,292
What are you saying?

557
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:13,299
Sir Rodolfo had a child with…

558
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:16,468
Jessica Clarito, sir.

559
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,138
What?

560
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,224
Do you know who?

561
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:26,562
Yes.

562
00:43:31,483 --> 00:43:32,901
Tell me everything.

563
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:15,963
You're the son of Rodolfo and Jessica?

564
00:45:17,297 --> 00:45:18,465
Yes, sir.

565
00:45:22,928 --> 00:45:24,346
What craziness is this?

566
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,722
It's true, Ma'am Aurora.

567
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,225
I am the son of Rodolfo and Jessica.

568
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:31,520
You are not and will never be a Palacios!

569
00:45:31,603 --> 00:45:33,939
No, Aurora, until the DNA proves it.

570
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,524
- Peter, is this your bed?
- Yes, ma'am.

571
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:39,278
Why is there blood on your shoes?
Did you kill Beverly?

572
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,904
He stole your identity!

573
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:42,906
Did you pretend to be me
in front of Sir Galvan?

574
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,949
I'm in dire need.

575
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,993
You're stealing Basil's watches?

576
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,536
Why do you have to steal?

577
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,621
<i>Don't you feel any shame</i>
<i>for your son, Basil?</i>

578
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:53,917
His body hasn't even rotted in his grave,
and you're already replacing him!

579
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:56,128
<i>I won't let this opportunity pass!</i>

580
00:45:56,211 --> 00:46:00,048
<i>This opportunity</i>
<i>to be a father to my nephew!</i>

581
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,092
Basil, my God!

582
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:05,679
Please haunt your father
so he comes to his senses!

583
