1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,890
<i>I will not let Basil control me.</i>

2
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:19,519
<i>I will not kill the person</i>
<i>I once treated like a sister.</i>

3
00:00:19,602 --> 00:00:21,104
<i>Sam, you're so basic.</i>

4
00:00:21,187 --> 00:00:23,189
Do you think that's the only video
of your murderous act?

5
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:25,525
I still have a lot of copies of that video
hidden in different places.

6
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,861
Either you follow my orders,
or I will expose the video.

7
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,071
I am not a murderer.

8
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:33,074
What could Basil's reason be
for wanting you gone?

9
00:00:33,158 --> 00:00:35,535
What you saw earlier? That was nothing.

10
00:00:35,618 --> 00:00:37,370
Give me your cell phone.

11
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,288
<i>What's your problem?</i>

12
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,706
Your mother is so stupid!

13
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,790
PREVIOUSLY

14
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,335
Your wife is an evil, manipulative bitch!

15
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,712
<i>One of us has to go,</i>

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:47,881
<i>and it's not gonna be me.</i>

17
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:50,592
<i>Someone always dies.</i>

18
00:00:50,675 --> 00:00:53,720
<i>They're covered with blood.</i>
<i>I don't know who they are.</i>

19
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>Hello? Oh my God. What happened?</i>

20
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:59,100
I'm so glad nothing bad happened to you.

21
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:01,436
<i>- Where were you?</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

22
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:03,396
I almost got run over earlier.

23
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,773
I have a feeling it wasn't an accident.

24
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,025
The mall. I went shopping.

25
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,736
Let's just wait for the results
of the investigation.

26
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,363
<i>There's no CCTV.</i>
<i>There's no other witnesses.</i>

27
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:14,991
So tell me, how can we find the car
that almost hit the victim?

28
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:17,827
Because of your stupidity,

29
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,329
George is requesting a bodyguard.

30
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:20,371
How will you kill her now?

31
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,916
My birthday is coming up.
Your time is running out.

32
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,918
What's going on here?
Where are you taking that?

33
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:26,628
<i>Did you not get your invitation?</i>

34
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:29,297
You're trying to erase my son's memory.

35
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,341
Do you also plan
to erase him from the company?

36
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:32,842
Who else would his replacement be?

37
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:37,263
I have better options in mind
rather than you!

38
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:39,098
I'm so tired.

39
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:41,351
Give me the gun. Let's talk.

40
00:01:41,434 --> 00:01:45,188
I only want to talk to one person.
I only want to talk to Paco!

41
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:48,149
If Paco were here,
he would hate to see you like this.

42
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,193
Don't give up on your life.

43
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,820
Why would I kill myself?

44
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,823
- Don't!
- Stop!

45
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:58,118
You are the one who should die!

46
00:01:58,201 --> 00:01:59,244
Don't, please!

47
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,916
Auntie Aurora, please don't.

48
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,709
- Don't…
- And why not?

49
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,507
This woman is the reason

50
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,927
why my son died!

51
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:24,769
From the moment you came into Paco's life,
my son's life became a mess.

52
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,981
It's you who killed him!

53
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,150
- Mother.
- Don't! Don't!

54
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,819
That's why you should die!

55
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:34,487
She's pregnant!

56
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,094
You're pregnant?

57
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:06,936
Doc, what happened to me?
Why did I pass out?

58
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,688
Based on your blood test,

59
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:12,108
you are two months pregnant,
Mrs. Palacios.

60
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:28,625
Yes.

61
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,461
I'm pregnant…

62
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,384
with Paco's child.

63
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,612
It's good to hear that Sir Paco left
someone to remember him by.

64
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:43,283
We'll have a little Paco
here at the estate.

65
00:04:52,875 --> 00:04:58,089
It's just too bad that Sir Paco
won't see his child grow up.

66
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,453
I will become an auntie?

67
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,952
I don't need these, Mother.

68
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:37,331
I can't give Basil a child.

69
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,044
While Sam…

70
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,843
Why is it like that, Mother?

71
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,767
If it weren't for Sam and her family,
all this wouldn't be happening.

72
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,313
Father wouldn't have died.

73
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,774
I wouldn't have been forced
to work abroad.

74
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:11,157
I lost my baby before
because of Sam and her family.

75
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:16,787
I can no longer become pregnant
because of them.

76
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,707
It's so unfair, Mother.

77
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:23,503
I'm scared

78
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,129
because it is possible
that my husband will replace me

79
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,674
because I can't give him a child.

80
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:34,263
But Sam, who has already lost her husband,
still became pregnant.

81
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:42,480
Why is Sam the only one
who fell pregnant, Mother?

82
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:49,612
Sam is pregnant?

83
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:11,592
Sam…

84
00:09:12,426 --> 00:09:19,100
At least the sadness you feel because of
Paco's death will be lessened a little

85
00:09:19,183 --> 00:09:23,688
because he's left you
with a beautiful memory.

86
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,528
I will take care of our baby, Mother.

87
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,240
I will love our child.

88
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,825
I will not control our child

89
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:40,246
like Paco's mother controlled him.

90
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,081
Of course, Sam.

91
00:09:42,164 --> 00:09:44,584
And don't worry.

92
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,461
Because you won't be alone
raising the baby.

93
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,005
You have us.

94
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:53,801
Me? I will be his father figure…

95
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,345
if I don't die early from cancer.

96
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,805
- Oh my God, Francis.
- Francis!

97
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,432
Don't joke that way.

98
00:09:59,515 --> 00:10:01,392
- It's just a joke. A joke.
- I don't like that joke.

99
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,854
Of course I will get well.

100
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,606
I will get well, Sam,

101
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,066
so I can be there for you
when you're raising your baby.

102
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:10,985
Especially if it's a boy.

103
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,321
Who's going to teach him
how to play basketball?

104
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,156
Don't tell me Basil will.

105
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,575
Right, Mother?

106
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,286
It should be me.

107
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:32,048
Love…

108
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:35,801
Why are you crying?

109
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,514
She's just sad

110
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:43,517
because Sam got ahead of her
in getting pregnant.

111
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:53,027
She just got ahead of you.

112
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,697
Then why are you so affected?

113
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,408
I didn't realize we were on a race.

114
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:02,703
Unless…

115
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:06,791
Unless you can't give me a child.

116
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:09,919
No, no.

117
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,088
No, of course not, love.

118
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,091
Of course I can give you a child.

119
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,260
Next year, I promise. I will get pregnant.

120
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,559
Good.

121
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,446
Even in the afterlife,

122
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,282
you still didn't forsake me, son.

123
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,954
You saw me suffering,

124
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,832
so you gave me a gift…

125
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:51,252
A one-of-a-kind gift.

126
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,926
All this sadness, all this pain,

127
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,888
it suddenly disappeared, Paco.

128
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:08,853
I will raise your child…

129
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:12,940
the way I raised you, Paco.

130
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,569
I will love my grandchild

131
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,655
the way I loved you.

132
00:12:21,907 --> 00:12:23,742
I will double my love, my dear.

133
00:12:24,743 --> 00:12:25,828
No.

134
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:29,415
I will triple it.

135
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:32,668
I will triple my love for my grandchild.

136
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:19,048
Congratulations to the future grandmother.

137
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,301
Thank you, Amando.

138
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:24,136
Eat first.

139
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:26,555
No, I can't.

140
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,307
I have so many things to do.

141
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,267
Oh, and…

142
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:35,397
tell Basil that he can celebrate
his birthday here.

143
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,026
We have a million reasons
to celebrate, Amando.

144
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,120
Those are all our floral arrangements.

145
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:40,165
We still need to fix the tables
and the table settings.

146
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,166
Okay.

147
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,919
Everything is going according to plan.

148
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,796
- Okay.
- Yes.

149
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,589
The food is more than enough for everyone.

150
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,299
And then the band is coming?

151
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,676
I'm assuming the host is ready?

152
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,386
- Yes.
- All the spiels are correct?

153
00:16:52,469 --> 00:16:54,096
All right. We've got enough for guests?

154
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:56,265
Yes, the food is more than enough
for everyone.

155
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,183
- Okay. Drinks, especially?
- Yes.

156
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,853
Okay. It looks like everything
is taken care of.

157
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,771
If there's anything I think about,
I'll let you know.

158
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,148
- Okay.
- Good job.

159
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,448
I heard the news.

160
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,326
Instead of a reduction,

161
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,454
there's going to be an addition
to the Palacios' Estate.

162
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:03,874
Basil…

163
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:07,169
I know what you're gonna say,
and the answer is no.

164
00:18:12,257 --> 00:18:15,260
You cannot use your pregnancy
as an excuse.

165
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:17,471
I mean if anything,

166
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,348
that baby should motivate you

167
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,309
to finish what I asked you to do.

168
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,110
Can you imagine?

169
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:35,197
What will happen to this child
if you go to jail?

170
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,378
- Hey!
- Oh!

171
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,964
Oh!

172
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,813
Let's talk next time.

173
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:09,273
But remember,

174
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,858
your time is running out.

175
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:35,299
Did I scare you?

176
00:19:35,382 --> 00:19:36,425
Of course not.

177
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:39,303
Look, I'm a little lost.

178
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:40,804
I can't find Dad.

179
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,472
Do you know where he is?

180
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:48,729
What are you looking at?

181
00:19:48,812 --> 00:19:50,314
Just a moment.

182
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:52,566
I'm sorry, I need to tell
my sister something.

183
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:03,785
Rosemarie.

184
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:09,666
Is everything set for tonight's party?

185
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:10,709
Yes, sir.

186
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,212
Wow.

187
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,755
Love your setup.

188
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,715
- Thank you.
- Nice. It's beautiful.

189
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,649
The setup is nice, even the stage.

190
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:34,608
Hi, Dad.

191
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,151
Oh, Sofia.

192
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,988
I just want to drop by
this gift we got for Basil.

193
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,657
How nice of you to come.

194
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:45,702
Well, I convinced Mom
to just watch a movie with me

195
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,289
rather than join Basil's birthday.

196
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,749
Look.

197
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,918
Why don't you stay for the party?

198
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:53,919
Stay.

199
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,379
- No, it'll be fine.
- Have fun.

200
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,882
I'm sure Basil wouldn't mind.

201
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:00,175
Oh, wow.

202
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,344
You invited her?

203
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,098
Darling, this is an exclusive party.

204
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:07,683
Leeches are not allowed.

205
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:10,352
I don't see any leeches around.

206
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,311
Where?

207
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:13,272
Do you want a mirror to see?

208
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:15,315
Why don't you get along?

209
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,276
You're both my children.

210
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,570
Dad, I'm allergic to users.

211
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,365
Well, you better get used to it

212
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:26,410
because I'm gonna be here the whole night.

213
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:31,164
Dad, Mommy and I will no longer
watch a movie.

214
00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:33,542
Happy birthday, Basil.

215
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,044
Just know your place, peasant.

216
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,130
Oh, I know my place.

217
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:41,008
Here, annoying you.

218
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,592
A gift for you.

219
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:44,761
Take it.

220
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,140
Come on, I'll show you around.

221
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:00,819
Good evening.

222
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:02,029
Good evening.

223
00:22:03,238 --> 00:22:04,489
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

224
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:05,615
- Hello, good evening.
- Good evening.

225
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:07,868
Welcome, please enjoy.

226
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,287
- George, you look so beautiful.
- Thank you. You too.

227
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,747
Thanks. Of course,
I want to look good too.

228
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,415
- It'd be a shame if…
- There are lots of guests.

229
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,250
Yes. My goodness!

230
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:50,577
Who is that? Do you know her?

231
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:55,248
- Hello, I'm George…
- George Palacios.

232
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,334
Basil's wife.

233
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,588
I heard so many things about you.

234
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,093
It's nice to finally meet you.

235
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,017
Wait, Basil never mentioned me?

236
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:17,854
Our history?

237
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,233
That we fooled around before?

238
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:25,755
Ma'am?

239
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:29,634
What are you doing here?

240
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:47,402
But don't worry.
It's all in the past, fortunately.

241
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,655
But how typical of Basil not to tell you.

242
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,826
I'm Beatrice Royales by the way.

243
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,787
And this is my nephew, Louie Castor.

244
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,124
In fairness,

245
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,628
I super love what you did to the party.

246
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,173
Basil really has taste.

247
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:10,717
Ma'am?

248
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,179
What are you doing here?

249
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,640
There's a rat in my room.

250
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,644
What about you?

251
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,980
What are you doing here?
Shouldn't you be outside?

252
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:27,567
I'm looking for Ma'am Rebecca.

253
00:25:27,651 --> 00:25:29,319
It's time for her to drink her medicine.

254
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:31,696
I'll just look for Ma'am Rebecca

255
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,658
and then I'll help you catch
the rat in your room.

256
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:37,911
No need.

257
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,371
I can do it.

258
00:25:39,454 --> 00:25:40,497
Let's go.

259
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,095
She's beautiful, George.

260
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,388
And sophisticated.

261
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,600
I think Basil could fall for her.

262
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,520
Do you think she is Basil's mistress?

263
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:05,188
She said they have a past.

264
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,523
That's just the past

265
00:26:06,606 --> 00:26:09,859
but you're the present, so don't worry.

266
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,611
George…

267
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,991
I have a hunch who Basil's mistress is.

268
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:25,083
Ma'am, you forgot this.

269
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,787
So what if Sam and Basil were talking?

270
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,414
That doesn't mean anything.

271
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,048
But why do they have to talk in secret?

272
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,716
And George…

273
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,926
Basil touched Sam's tummy.

274
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:23,892
I'm telling you,
there's something between them.

275
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:28,688
You know, that Sam
takes after Mercy, her mother.

276
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:31,524
Remember, she did the same thing
to us before.

277
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,401
When her husband died,

278
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,987
she seduced your father.

279
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:40,658
Now Sam is the widow and she wants
to steal Basil from you. Is that it?

280
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:45,246
George, wasn't she the one
who gave you the death threat letter?

281
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,084
Maybe the reason
why nobody knows about that

282
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:53,838
is because it came from someone
inside the house.

283
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,049
Why would Sam do that?

284
00:27:56,132 --> 00:27:57,300
To destroy you,

285
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:58,676
so you two will fight

286
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,221
and Sam will steal your husband from you.

287
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,397
Francis?

288
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,514
<i>Mother, don't take morphine.</i>

289
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,598
It's bad for you.

290
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:48,226
Yes, Mother. Morphine is dangerous.

291
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,603
If you overdose on it, you can die.

292
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,815
I want you to kill someone for me.

293
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:54,941
Who?

294
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,317
Your best friend.

295
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,402
George?

296
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:47,327
Are you having an affair with my husband?

297
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,173
What?

298
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,551
Yes or no.

299
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,845
Are you flirting with Basil?

300
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,680
And why would I do that?

301
00:30:07,764 --> 00:30:10,183
The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.

302
00:30:10,266 --> 00:30:11,684
Your mother seduced my father,

303
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:13,770
and now you're trying to do the same.

304
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:17,398
Your husband is all yours.

305
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,033
George!

306
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,792
Don't you dare touch the mother
of my grandchild.

307
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:42,298
If I ever see you harassing Sam again,

308
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,135
I will personally cut that hand

309
00:30:46,219 --> 00:30:49,556
and hang it on the chandelier.

310
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:52,308
That's all.

311
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:55,395
Now, leave.

312
00:31:01,484 --> 00:31:02,819
Are you hurt?

313
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,321
How's the baby?

314
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,073
The baby's fine.

315
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:08,908
Good.

316
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,243
Now, come with me.

317
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,496
I said…

318
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,582
come with me.

319
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,395
I have no idea what she's up to.

320
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,814
Let's just keep an eye out.

321
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:43,026
Come on, let's go over there.

322
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,449
Is everything okay?

323
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:33,826
Of course. Why wouldn't it be okay?

324
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,581
Because I know a woman in trouble
when I see one.

325
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:42,126
I've been in that position before.

326
00:32:45,254 --> 00:32:46,923
You can talk to me.

327
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:49,926
Or not.

328
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,511
Up to you.

329
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,528
Can I have your attention, please?

330
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:16,911
It's my distinct honor to introduce to you

331
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:18,746
the birthday boy himself,

332
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,748
my son,

333
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,917
Basil Palacios.

334
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:46,107
Sir Basil is such a show-off.

335
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,417
Happy birthday.

336
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:04,811
What's happening?

337
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:08,147
Is this a part of your surprise entrance?

338
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:03,744
Ma'am Aurora's entrance is really grand.

339
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,392
Sorry.

340
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,435
What? What do you mean by
three thousand pesos?

341
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,728
Are you fools?

342
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:35,104
The jacket of my brother-in-law
is branded.

343
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:37,148
If that's the case, I'll just
sell that to someone else!

344
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,358
You jerk!

345
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,321
Are you selling Paco's things?

346
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,701
Does Auntie Aurora know this?

347
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,709
Good evening, everyone.

348
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,880
Galvan and I

349
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,717
are the sixth generation of Palacios.

350
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,636
The birthday boy here, Basil,

351
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:10,097
and my late son, Paco,

352
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,224
are the seventh.

353
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:16,228
And tonight, I'm happy to announce

354
00:39:16,312 --> 00:39:23,027
that the eighth generation of my family
has finally arrived.

355
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,322
Eight.

356
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:28,449
The luckiest number.

357
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,534
The shape of infinity.

358
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:35,539
Sam, can you join me here on the stage?

359
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:59,438
Ladies and gentlemen, my daughter-in-law,

360
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:03,025
Samantha Castillo-Palacios

361
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:05,444
is pregnant.

362
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,366
She's carrying my grandchild,

363
00:40:10,449 --> 00:40:14,412
the first of the lucky generation.

364
00:40:17,957 --> 00:40:24,713
The future of Palacios Mining
and this great family.

365
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:49,905
Congratulations, Sam.

366
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:51,949
Congrats.

367
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,437
Amando.

368
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,272
Please.

369
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,605
George, there you are.

370
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:07,233
Ward and I have been looking for you.

371
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:11,654
Goodness, stop drinking.

372
00:42:11,737 --> 00:42:14,031
You're even less likely to get pregnant
if you do that.

373
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,951
Mother, I already told you,
I can't get pregnant.

374
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:19,745
I can't give Basil a child.

375
00:42:29,171 --> 00:42:30,756
So…

376
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:36,428
that's your secret.

377
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,980
Don't worry, I won't tell.

378
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,731
But you have to tell Basil.

379
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:49,608
Now. Trust me.

380
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,778
The longer you keep a lie,

381
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,155
the bigger it will hurt.

382
00:42:57,950 --> 00:43:00,244
What if he leaves me?

383
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,667
No, he won't.

384
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:11,422
I've known Basil since we were teens.

385
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:15,259
I know how he loves.

386
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,804
He loves truly,

387
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,100
he loves deeply,

388
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,645
and he loves madly.

389
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,858
He is very mad when he is in love.

390
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:43,287
Louie, you're here too?

391
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:46,874
Yeah, you know. Nephew duties.

392
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:48,667
I just accompanied Auntie Beatrice.

393
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:51,503
How about you?

394
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:54,548
I thought you were mad
at your half-brother.

395
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,591
I am.

396
00:43:56,342 --> 00:43:58,344
So why are you here then?

397
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:04,016
Is it because you knew that
I was going to be here too?

398
00:44:04,099 --> 00:44:05,267
Please!

399
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,062
I stayed on purpose.

400
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:12,566
I just wanted to see Basil's reaction
once he sees our surprise for him.

401
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:14,234
That's all.

402
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,404
Yeah, right.

403
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,208
Happy birthday, Basil

404
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,292
Congratulations.

405
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:31,669
Thank you.

406
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,589
- Congrats on your baby.
- Thank you.

407
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:10,874
How dare you upstage me
at my own birthday party?

408
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:13,919
You really want to go to jail, huh?

409
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:17,381
Don't release the video.

410
00:45:18,382 --> 00:45:21,760
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

411
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:25,389
Because tonight…

412
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,599
George will die.

413
00:45:39,069 --> 00:45:40,737
Poison?

414
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:52,249
Make sure you do it properly this time.

415
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:01,049
There's the birthday boy! Basil!

416
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,551
Hi!

417
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:03,594
Hi, bitch.

418
00:46:04,052 --> 00:46:05,387
You're something else.

419
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,348
Hi.

420
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:11,143
I'm Beatrice.

421
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,227
Sam.

422
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,187
Hello.

423
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:18,192
Basil, your wife wants to talk to you.

424
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,819
Okay.

425
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,489
Nice to see you.

426
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,712
Sam, can you watch our drinks?

427
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,255
I need to take this call.

428
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,799
- Sure.
- Thank you.

429
00:47:13,121 --> 00:47:14,998
Basil, I can't get pregnant.

430
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:17,084
<i>My love for you won't change.</i>

431
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,379
<i>If we can't have children, so be it.</i>

432
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,422
<i>It seems you're softening towards Sam.</i>

433
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,425
<i>She's still carrying Paco's child.</i>

434
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,219
I won't let anything bad
happen to the baby.

435
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,221
That baby is the only thing

436
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:31,640
that's keeping me alive, Amando.

437
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:33,225
NEXT EPISODE

438
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:37,229
That's roughly around
ten million pesos' worth of jewelry.

439
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,438
You can have all of that.

440
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,941
I just want one thing in return,

441
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:42,109
I want your baby.

442
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,777
You're a Palacios?

443
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,405
Why are you just a staff member here?

444
00:47:47,656 --> 00:47:49,658
Tell me honestly, Amando.

445
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,578
Did you poison Basil for me?
