1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,808
On the count of three, you push.

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:21,563
One, two, three, push!

3
00:00:21,646 --> 00:00:23,481
As hard as you can, push.

4
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,400
Push!

5
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:29,404
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:00:30,155 --> 00:00:32,782
At last… you are here.

7
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:39,748
<i>Thank you, son.</i>

8
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,541
<i>You didn't fail me,</i>

9
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:45,211
<i>not like what that woman</i>
<i>did to me again and again.</i>

10
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,256
<i>That started when her family killed Dad.</i>

11
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,883
Mrs. Georgina called you?

12
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:53,094
Mom, remember, George called
you around 10 a.m.?

13
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:54,763
I'll have her number
pinned by the network,

14
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,223
so we can trace where
she was when she called.

15
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,601
And despite everything
that's happened to us,

16
00:00:59,684 --> 00:01:03,229
I'm happy that we've remained friends.

17
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:06,441
I want you to know
how important you are to me.

18
00:01:06,524 --> 00:01:10,028
And now, we are both his mothers.

19
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:18,369
If we get any information,
I'll update you.

20
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,872
Okay, thank you.

21
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,397
Aunt Mercy.

22
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,486
Ward?

23
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,197
Don't worry.

24
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,200
Nothing will happen to Sam or her baby.

25
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,204
I know George.
She will not neglect the two of them.

26
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,583
Thank you very much, Ward.

27
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,128
You're so kind.

28
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:12,590
Despite everything that's happened
to our family…

29
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:15,718
you've always been ready to support us.

30
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,097
Sam taught me that.

31
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,017
No matter how many times
she and George fight,

32
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,770
she still chooses to support us.

33
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:53,464
He's so beautiful to watch.

34
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:57,802
I will never get tired of watching him.

35
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:01,472
I know, but since
you were so tired earlier,

36
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:04,267
it would be better if you rested.

37
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,436
Get the baby to sleep with you

38
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,771
so you'll have energy again
when you wake up.

39
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,316
Thank you, Sis.

40
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:23,828
<i>Go to sleep, so my son and I can leave.</i>

41
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,339
- That's delicious.
- Go ahead.

42
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:36,633
Thank you.

43
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,218
I hope the Palacios killer or mastermind

44
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,429
didn't kidnap Ma'am George and Ma'am Sam.

45
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:44,641
Well, it's your fault too.

46
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,268
You didn't accompany your bosses.

47
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:51,689
You two even conspired with them
to escape from me.

48
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,151
I don't think they were kidnapped.

49
00:03:56,819 --> 00:04:01,866
It seems Miss George and Sir Galvan
have a bad plan for Miss Sam.

50
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,161
Think about it.

51
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,414
It wasn't just the Balays
who were angry with Miss Sam

52
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,250
when Miss George had a miscarriage,

53
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:13,211
Sir Galvan was too.

54
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,963
Have you thought about it?

55
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,261
I don't think I can do it, Sir Galvan.

56
00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:26,516
You just want me
to raise the price, right?

57
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,268
Fine.

58
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,271
Ten million pesos.

59
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:34,774
What kind of revenge do you want?

60
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:37,610
I can't kill anyone.

61
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:41,239
You won't kill Sam.

62
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,243
All I want is for her to be crippled.

63
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,745
Like what happened to me.

64
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,711
That's your plan A, Dad?

65
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,755
Cairo, leave us alone for now.

66
00:05:06,222 --> 00:05:07,932
I was curious,

67
00:05:08,016 --> 00:05:10,810
so I listened to their conversation
outside the door.

68
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:12,437
Yes, George.

69
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:15,356
That's my plan A.

70
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:19,610
I want to hurt Sam
for what she did to my grandson.

71
00:05:21,112 --> 00:05:22,947
Dad, I don't agree with your plan.

72
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:27,785
She killed your son, my grandson.

73
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,039
She deserves to be punished.

74
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,792
I don't want to see her
happily giving birth to a child,

75
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:39,005
while you mourn for baby Basil.

76
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,884
Not with the plan I have in mind.

77
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,428
She's the one who will mourn.

78
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,599
What do you mean?

79
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,394
We will steal her son.

80
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:57,190
Are you saying you'll get ahead of Aurora?

81
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,901
No, Dad.

82
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,945
We will help Aunt Aurora take the baby,

83
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,823
and then we will steal the baby
from Auntie Aurora.

84
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,658
How?

85
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:13,790
We will still sue Sam.

86
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,125
Once she is in jail,

87
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:20,296
it will be easier
for Aunt Aurora to get the child.

88
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:23,299
And then we will steal the baby
from Aunt Aurora.

89
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:35,186
Well, if that's what Ma'am George
and Sir Galvan have planned,

90
00:06:35,269 --> 00:06:37,980
it's possible that Ma'am George
kidnapped Ma'am Sam.

91
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:44,153
Will Ma'am George and Sir Galvan
compete with Ma'am Aurora

92
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,405
to steal Ma'am Sam's child?

93
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,407
Most likely.

94
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,829
That's why Sir Galvan
accompanied Ma'am Aurora to Palawan

95
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:57,834
to make sure she can't go home
until Miss Sam gives birth,

96
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,629
and until Miss George
doesn't steal the baby.

97
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:03,840
How about Ms. Ruth and Ward?

98
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:07,927
Well, I don't know.
Maybe they're just pretending not to know.

99
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:15,768
Mom?

100
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,480
Mom, have you called George yet?

101
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:28,239
Passport?

102
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,172
Okay.

103
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,508
Just let me know when you have a lead.

104
00:08:29,634 --> 00:08:30,551
Okay.

105
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:41,020
Sarge? Hey.

106
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:44,482
How's your investigation
into the other case?

107
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:49,904
Is Ms. Vivian the mastermind?

108
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:55,201
Her running over Francis
it's an isolated case.

109
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,703
It has nothing to do
with the Palacios murder.

110
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,748
Ms. Vivian is not the mastermind.

111
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,793
Who is your suspect for the mastermind?

112
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:10,841
Ms. Mercy needs to know this
so she can report it to Sergeant Royales.

113
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,803
Hey, wait a minute, no. This fool.

114
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,513
Are you going to get me into trouble?

115
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,473
Didn't I tell you I wasn't sure yet?

116
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,600
No, I'll tell Ms. Mercy.

117
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,602
Didn't I tell you…

118
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:24,605
- You're so annoying. I told you not to.
- Cairo, stop that.

119
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,232
Hey, Cairo, stop that.

120
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,110
What, Ando? Are you a smart aleck too?

121
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,071
Let's not interfere
in our bosses' troubles.

122
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,949
Let's leave them to their own issues.

123
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,247
It's your fault too.

124
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:48,421
Sir, have some coffee first.

125
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:50,756
- Sarge, I'll go out for now.
- Thank you.

126
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,592
- Sir.
- Okay.

127
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,891
Sarge, who's your suspect?

128
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,605
I don't have any solid evidence
for a suspect.

129
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:08,024
If there is…

130
00:10:08,107 --> 00:10:10,818
Sergeant Casas and Villa
weren't able to look into it before,

131
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:11,736
so it's not in the report.

132
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:14,697
They're so incompetent.

133
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,033
They've been lax in their investigation.

134
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,245
If you were the one assigned to this case

135
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,246
in the first place,

136
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,415
I'm sure you would have solved it.

137
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,336
I had you investigated, Sarge.

138
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,422
Almost all the cases you've handled

139
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:32,965
have been solved quickly.

140
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,052
But, I also had a hard time

141
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:39,764
with the two high-profile cases
I handled before this Palacios case.

142
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:44,352
The one with Alexander Sagrado III,

143
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:48,064
and your Uncle Gustavo Royales,
is that right?

144
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,734
Which one did you have more trouble with?

145
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,445
They were different,
so it's hard to compare.

146
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,157
For the one with Uncle Gustavo,

147
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,326
we couldn't pinpoint a prime suspect
until the end.

148
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:04,997
With S3, Alexander Sagrado III,
it was also different.

149
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,086
Tonight is going to be a night
I will never forget

150
00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:11,754
until the day I die.

151
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:14,173
A night that wouldn't be possible

152
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:16,759
without the help
of my lovely wife, Jackie…

153
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,471
and my sister, <i>Ate</i> Barbara.

154
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,432
Now, the big question
on everyone's mind tonight

155
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:29,105
is who will take the Sagrado Foundation
to its next 25 years,

156
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:32,108
and who will continue
the legacy of my mother?

157
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:33,984
Well, I'm happy to announce

158
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:38,114
that the next Executive Director
of the Foundation will be me…

159
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:44,370
Alexander Sagrado III
is the new Executive Director…

160
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,164
of the Sagrado Foundation.

161
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:50,876
I knew it was you.

162
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,338
You've always wanted
to kill me, didn't you?

163
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,398
You have the right to remain silent.

164
00:12:12,481 --> 00:12:13,524
Do you understand this?

165
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:16,444
Sir, I didn't kill him. I was framed.

166
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,279
Sir, I'm innocent.

167
00:12:18,362 --> 00:12:19,738
Tell me what happened.

168
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,907
Sir Xander called.

169
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:23,492
<i>He asked me to go to his place.</i>

170
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:28,289
Sir, someone hit me,
and I lost consciousness.

171
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,373
Who?

172
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,459
The woman ran away from the pool.

173
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:36,922
Sir, she might be the killer,

174
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:40,176
the one who killed Sir Xander and hit me.

175
00:12:40,259 --> 00:12:43,471
This woman you're talking about,
what does she look like?

176
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:44,680
Can you identify her?

177
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:46,599
Sir…

178
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,435
Sir, no. I don't know anymore.

179
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,811
It was dark.

180
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,606
I've met many criminals.

181
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,693
Everyone lies during the investigation.

182
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,279
Don't make up stories.

183
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,280
You were caught in the act.

184
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,200
You had the gun in your hand,

185
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,743
and the victim's watch in your pocket.

186
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:10,289
You killed Mr. Sagrado
because you wanted to rob him.

187
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,207
Is that right?

188
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:16,045
But, maybe your boss fought back,
so you killed him.

189
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:20,925
You got into a fight,
he hit you in the head, so you shot him.

190
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,969
You had a motive
for doing it, to kill him.

191
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,305
Don't torture yourself.

192
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:30,726
This conversation will be easier
if you confess.

193
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,063
I won't confess to anything
because I didn't kill him.

194
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,231
Frank, Frank.

195
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,191
Sir, the accusations
you're making against Frank,

196
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:40,402
they're not true because he was framed.

197
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,821
You said you were with Mr. Kerubin

198
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,281
when someone tried to kill him.

199
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:47,618
He was mistaken
for Mr. Sagrado at the clubhouse.

200
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,995
Yes, Sir, that's true too.

201
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,581
That happened over a week ago.

202
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:55,084
Frank was wearing his boss's jacket.

203
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:57,670
Then the man called him Sagrado.

204
00:13:58,587 --> 00:13:59,463
A man?

205
00:14:00,047 --> 00:14:02,883
He was wearing a mask,
but his voice was a man's.

206
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:05,094
Frank even shot him in the shoulder.

207
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:10,349
Your client said that the one
he saw in the pool was a woman,

208
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,600
but the one who allegedly tried

209
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,979
to assassinate Mr. Sagrado was a man.

210
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,523
Sir, they could be conspirators, right?

211
00:14:17,606 --> 00:14:19,483
Just calm down. You're pregnant.

212
00:14:22,319 --> 00:14:25,531
You solved both the AS3
and Gustavo Royales cases.

213
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,368
That's why I'm confident that

214
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,287
you'll solve this case too, Sarge.

215
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:36,083
Of course. I won't stop
until I solve this.

216
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:41,672
But, I admit, this is no ordinary case.

217
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,257
It's complicated…

218
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,386
There are many victims.
So, there's more than one suspect.

219
00:14:49,305 --> 00:14:51,015
There's serial killing happening,

220
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:54,184
and it started
with the poisoning of Basil Palacios.

221
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,066
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

222
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:04,194
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

223
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,112
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

224
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,448
Welcome. Please enjoy.

225
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,491
George, you are beautiful.

226
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,452
- You too, Mom.
- Thank you. Of course.

227
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,453
- It's a shame if I'm not.
- There are a lot of guests.

228
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,787
Yes, that's right.

229
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:14,747
Oh, my.

230
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:49,990
Who is that? Do you know?

231
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:54,662
- Hello, I'm George…
- George Palacios.

232
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,747
Basil's wife.

233
00:15:58,832 --> 00:16:01,001
I've heard so many things about you.

234
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:05,798
It's nice to finally meet you.

235
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:13,430
Wait. Basil never mentioned me?

236
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,393
Our history?

237
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,646
That we've fooled around before?

238
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,129
Sir Basil is such a show-off.

239
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,786
What's going on?

240
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,290
Is this a part of your surprise entrance?

241
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:17,429
Ma'am Aurora's entrance is so explosive.

242
00:19:56,570 --> 00:20:01,617
To an extravagant year
and a fabulous future ahead of us.

243
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,912
Happy birthday to me.

244
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,502
What the hell is this?

245
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,671
Basil?

246
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:16,256
Brother.

247
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:20,802
Basil.

248
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,762
Lance…

249
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,388
- Yes, Mr. Galvan?
- do everything for my son.

250
00:20:23,472 --> 00:20:25,474
- We will do everything, sir.
- Please.

251
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,602
- Start ambu bagging now.
- We are, Mrs. Palacios.

252
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:29,686
We are, Mrs. Palacios.

253
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,773
Nurse, please assist Mrs. Palacios out.

254
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,524
No, please. No, no.

255
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,568
Let me go, Ward. Let me go.

256
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:37,903
Basil…

257
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,404
Hurry up, please.

258
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:40,989
Galvan, stop it.

259
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,492
Basil will survive this, okay?

260
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,619
My son can't die.

261
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,536
Please…

262
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,538
Basil, please. Please.

263
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,541
Do something. Hurry up.

264
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,919
- Basil…
- Continue CPR. Thank you.

265
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:57,798
Basil, please wake up. Wake up.

266
00:20:57,881 --> 00:20:59,258
Let's do a rhythm check.

267
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,552
Please, please. Basil, please wake up.

268
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:05,973
Give the last epis, please.

269
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,683
No.

270
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:09,851
- Basil, wake up. Please.
- Continue CPR. Last round.

271
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:11,645
Please, Doc.

272
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,774
I'm sorry, Mrs. Palacios.

273
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,443
Time of death, 9:35 p.m.

274
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,405
No! Revive my husband. No.

275
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:22,572
No.

276
00:21:22,656 --> 00:21:25,617
If you don't revive him, I will.

277
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,369
Basil. Basil, please wake up.

278
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,079
- Basil, please.
- Ma'am. Ma'am, stop.

279
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:31,123
- Basil, wake up.
- Ma'am, please stop.

280
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,874
- Wake up, Basil.
- Ma'am, please stop.

281
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,086
No, let me go!

282
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,754
Basil!

283
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,841
My husband needs me.

284
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:43,135
Let me go, Ward.

285
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:44,886
Let me go!

286
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,221
Basil!

287
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,141
Let me go.

288
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:50,058
Basil…

289
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,935
What's happening? What's happening?

290
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:54,771
I'm sorry, Mr. Galvan.
We have done everything.

291
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,106
Basil did not make it.

292
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,816
What?

293
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,401
No.

294
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:01,528
No, he can't die.

295
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,405
Basil can't die!

296
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,325
No! No!

297
00:22:07,409 --> 00:22:08,410
No.

298
00:22:09,745 --> 00:22:11,204
Galvan, calm down.

299
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:14,541
How can I calm down?

300
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,055
Why can't I contact you?

301
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:29,473
I can't make a move.

302
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,602
George, what's our plan? What? Answer me.

303
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,313
Mom…

304
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:42,819
why are our names Evelyn,
Lucia and Marlo Reyes here?

305
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,614
Why do we have fake IDs?

306
00:22:47,282 --> 00:22:49,618
And why does the baby have a passport?

307
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:53,163
What's this for, Mom?
And who's this Gilbert Reyes?

308
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,042
These are my requirements for a passport.

309
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,668
Where are we going?

310
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:00,796
And when?

311
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:05,926
I'm excited. It looks like
we're going to a good place.

312
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,349
Why do you look that way?

313
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:16,394
This looks like a big surprise.

314
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:18,230
What's the urgent thing you asked me for?

315
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,023
What's that suitcase for?

316
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,109
We're leaving now, Ward.
That's what your sister said.

317
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,070
This is the trip abroad.
She said we need to leave now.

318
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:26,613
Well then, I have to say goodbye to Sofia.

319
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:29,282
- We had an agreement that…
- Oh, oh, oh. No, no.

320
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:30,992
There's no time to say goodbye to Sofia.

321
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:33,537
Your sister said
we have to leave right now.

322
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,539
What's the problem, Mom?

323
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:37,499
Is there another murder
among the Palacios family

324
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,084
and George is involved in this again?

325
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,293
Wait.

326
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,629
Mom, I have Sergeant Royales' number.

327
00:23:42,712 --> 00:23:43,880
I'll call him right away.

328
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,007
- We need to report this…
- Don't. Don't.

329
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:46,925
What is this?

330
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,846
Ward, don't mess with that. Give me that.

331
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:55,684
Mom…

332
00:23:57,477 --> 00:23:59,729
are you and George
hiding something from me?

333
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,190
Mom, don't deny it.

334
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,151
You and George
are hiding something from me.

335
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,944
Tell me the truth.

336
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:12,617
Ward, your sister, and I
will definitely tell you.

337
00:24:14,411 --> 00:24:15,745
Listen.

338
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,498
I'll explain everything to you.

339
00:24:50,113 --> 00:24:52,449
Don't cry, baby Gilbert.

340
00:24:52,532 --> 00:24:53,950
It's Mommy.

341
00:24:57,746 --> 00:24:58,747
George…

342
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,710
What happened to our baby?

343
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:05,295
Why is he crying?

344
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,842
Don't worry, he is okay. Just rest.

345
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,511
Maybe he is hungry. Give him to me.

346
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,638
Maybe he is hungry.

347
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:40,247
That started the deluge in this family.

348
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,209
The mess that still
hasn't been resolved to this day.

349
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:45,126
Please…

350
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,254
He is the future CEO of Palacios Mining.

351
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:50,048
I can't rely on Rebecca

352
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:52,884
to take over my position.

353
00:25:53,551 --> 00:25:54,803
Really, Aurora?

354
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,683
My son, Basil, just died,

355
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,478
and you're still thinking
about the company.

356
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:05,397
You don't really care about my son.

357
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,941
Don't be a hypocrite, Galvan.

358
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,150
Earlier…

359
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:12,195
while Basil was in the ER,

360
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:15,657
you were still thinking about the company,

361
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,993
that Basil will be my successor.

362
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:20,537
Yeah, but he's gone.

363
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,833
Basil is gone. He is gone.

364
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,419
He's gone.

365
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:30,046
I'm sorry.

366
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,507
- Stop.
- No, it is.

367
00:26:33,550 --> 00:26:35,760
You didn't even look at him in the morgue.

368
00:26:37,137 --> 00:26:38,722
Why are you here?

369
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:45,645
Did you come here
to make sure Basil would die?

370
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:46,896
What?

371
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:49,107
"If you outlive me…"

372
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,777
That's the last thing you told Basil.

373
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,784
You won't stay in the moment, huh?

374
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,119
You're not just showing everyone here

375
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:03,163
that you have the most power
in the company…

376
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,456
and the family.

377
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:08,585
Good to know
that the message was sent clearly, Basil.

378
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:09,919
Pathetic.

379
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:12,505
Well, if you think about it,
you need to remind everyone

380
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:13,673
that you're still the CEO

381
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:17,886
because soon your reign will be over.

382
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:20,055
Why? Because you will steal it?

383
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:24,142
Dream on, Basil.

384
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,811
You will never steal my company from me.

385
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,271
Your company?

386
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,689
It's not yours.

387
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:31,358
It has never been.

388
00:27:31,441 --> 00:27:33,568
It has always been Palacios Mining,

389
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,111
for a hundred years now.

390
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:37,864
It was not, is not,

391
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,450
and will never be Aurora's Mining.

392
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,995
I am also a Palacios.

393
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:45,997
I own it too…

394
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:47,999
so, don't think it is your own.

395
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:50,168
You're so greedy.

396
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:53,713
That's why you lost your son

397
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,924
who you are controlling.

398
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,384
Because you're so greedy.

399
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:08,812
Enjoy it while you still can,
Auntie Aurora.

400
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:12,649
Because now that your precious
Paco is dead,

401
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:15,902
stripping away your position
will be as easy

402
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:18,029
as flicking a switch.

403
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:24,202
Do you really think you can be CEO, Basil?

404
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:31,709
Your delusion will only happen
if you outlive me.

405
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:34,379
Because as long as I am alive,

406
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:40,510
you will never be the CEO of my company.

407
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,101
You didn't want my son to outlive you.

408
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:51,187
- That's why you poisoned him.
- What?

409
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:54,107
- It was you who poisoned my son.
- That's ridiculous.

410
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,900
You murderer.

411
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,152
Dad…

412
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,154
Dad.

413
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,947
Let go of Aurora.

414
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,784
Sir Basil was poisoned.

415
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,035
That's for sure.

416
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:10,081
So, who could the killer be?

417
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,626
Who knows? He could be among us?

418
00:29:14,210 --> 00:29:16,421
He's just here, roaming around.

419
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,758
Jericho?

420
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,846
Was it you?

421
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:30,935
Hey. Stop.

422
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,979
- You're a jerk.
- You're a jerk too.

423
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,189
Why are you accusing me?

424
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,483
When you were talking to Mr. Palacios

425
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:39,194
before he went up for his toast,

426
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:41,696
did he mention anything
that could be connected to this?

427
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,866
Nothing. We just talked
about some personal matters.

428
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,410
Basil, I can't get pregnant.

429
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,247
Don't cry, okay?

430
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,292
It's okay.

431
00:29:55,668 --> 00:29:57,003
Nothing changes.

432
00:29:57,587 --> 00:30:01,174
If we can't have children, so be it.

433
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:03,676
It will just be you and me

434
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,386
on this day…

435
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:08,640
until the end of our days.

436
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,392
But, a few days ago,

437
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,104
I saw Basil talking to someone
secretly over the phone.

438
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:18,274
I know…

439
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,237
Stupid girl.

440
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,823
I was just kidding.

441
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,950
- Calm down.
- Jericho, calm down.

442
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,993
- Calm down.
- Don't joke like that.

443
00:30:29,786 --> 00:30:31,287
I might be punished.

444
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:33,498
Why? You're guilty, right?

445
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,999
Guilty? Me?

446
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,793
- You're guilty.
- Me? Do you have evidence?

447
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:39,212
Maybe it was really you
who poisoned Sir Basil.

448
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:41,089
What did you say, DJ?

449
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,678
Jericho, was it you who poisoned Basil?

450
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,066
Ms. Georgina…

451
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,574
Answer me. Was it you
who poisoned my husband?

452
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,619
That's not true, ma'am.

453
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,789
Then what did DJ just say?

454
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:18,710
Ms. Georgina, please.

455
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,754
We have a potential suspect here.

456
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,383
DJ, go ahead and talk. Tell us the truth.

457
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,010
Why are you saying he poisoned Basil?

458
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,845
We were just joking, ma'am.

459
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,430
That was really a joke.

460
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:32,640
But, Jericho got pissed off right away.

461
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,726
Maybe you don't know, ma'am,

462
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,229
but the other day, Sir Basil
and Jericho fought…

463
00:31:38,313 --> 00:31:40,815
This is between me and this gutter trash.

464
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,066
What?

465
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,444
Basil…

466
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,322
Basil.

467
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,451
You're a fool. Here.

468
00:31:51,534 --> 00:31:52,452
Try to avoid this.

469
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:54,913
What?

470
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:57,665
And after they fought,

471
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:01,127
Jericho said that would soon end.

472
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,755
These rich people are terrible.

473
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:07,216
We poor people are just
their punching bag.

474
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,676
Just let him be.

475
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:09,802
It will eventually end.

476
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,221
Would I poison Sir Basil
just because of that?

477
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:13,598
I don't know about you.

478
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:20,146
Basil pointed a gun at you.
That's why you got mad at him.

479
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,397
You have a motive.

480
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:23,483
And this is your revenge.

481
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,151
- You poisoned him.
- Ma'am, stop.

482
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,945
- You poisoned my husband.
- Ma'am, calm down.

483
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,948
- You're shameless.
- Ma'am, calm down.

484
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:32,033
- You're a fool.
- Guys, please.

485
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,369
If you were mad at him,
you could've beaten him up

486
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,287
- instead of poisoning him.
- Stop. No.

487
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:38,831
No, no. Stop accusing Jericho.
He is innocent.

488
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,917
I killed Basil.

489
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,176
He took Tonyo away from me.

490
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,095
Rebeca, shut up.

491
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,808
Will you take responsibility
for everybody who dies here?

492
00:32:56,891 --> 00:32:57,809
No, no, no…

493
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:01,521
Look. Do you see?

494
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:04,732
I'm not lying this time.

495
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,319
I killed Basil.

496
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,613
I poisoned him.

497
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:16,202
You poisoned him?

498
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:18,913
Yes, I did.

499
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:20,748
I poisoned him…

500
00:33:23,543 --> 00:33:25,920
with rat poison.

501
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:29,549
I did. I'm so sorry.

502
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:31,175
I'm so sorry.

503
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:39,225
You didn't give your boss her medicine.

504
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:43,312
- Go take her back inside.
- What are you saying?

505
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,857
Get out of my face, Rebecca.
Both of you, get out.

506
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,775
- No, no, I'm telling the truth.
- Get out!

507
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:48,818
- Stop it, enough.
- Oh, my.

508
00:33:48,901 --> 00:33:51,571
Guys, please.
Listen to me, I'm telling the truth.

509
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,072
He is innocent.

510
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,200
Here, sir.

511
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:59,370
Here's the prescription
the doctor gave me five days ago.

512
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:03,541
You're right.

513
00:34:05,835 --> 00:34:08,171
You've had it for five days already.
Is this the one?

514
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,630
Yes, sir.

515
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,632
So, this should be 25 pieces.

516
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:12,925
Yes, sir.

517
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,727
Why is this just 17?

518
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:25,396
- What?
- Where are the eight tablets?

519
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,314
Seventeen?

520
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:31,652
Sir, impossible.

521
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,696
I've only taken five tablets.
Just a second.

522
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:45,917
- Let go of me.
- Animal.

523
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,627
You poisoned my son.

524
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,837
- Animal.
- Wait.

525
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,214
I will kill you too.

526
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,216
Don't.

527
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,676
- Animal.
- Stop it.

528
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,428
Hey. Where are you going?

529
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,347
- Go after him.
- Francis. Francis.

530
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,727
- Francis.
- Francis. What else are you waiting for?

531
00:35:04,811 --> 00:35:05,853
Shoot him.

532
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:09,107
Shoot him.

533
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:13,027
- Shoot him.
- No.

534
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,362
- Don't.
- Mr. Palacios, you can't do that.

535
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,947
- Don't.
- Let go of me.

536
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:18,282
- Mother?
- Mother.

537
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:19,909
- Mother.
- Don't.

538
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,287
Don't. Don't.

539
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,081
I'm begging you, don't.

540
00:35:25,164 --> 00:35:26,415
My brother is innocent.

541
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:32,588
- No, no…
- Mr. Palacios, I'm warning you.

542
00:35:32,672 --> 00:35:34,465
Put down the gun.

543
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,426
- Stop it…
- Dad, he poisoned Basil.

544
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,805
No. No, it wasn't him.

545
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:42,640
Sam.

546
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,064
Go, Villa.

547
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,066
Francis.

548
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,693
- Francis…
- What happened?

549
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,741
Animal.

550
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:03,119
Why did you kill my husband?

551
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,288
- Stop it.
- I didn't poison Basil.

552
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:06,539
- It wasn't me.
- Stop it.

553
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,291
Stop it.

554
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:09,834
My daughter was accused,

555
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:11,919
but it turns out
your brother was the one responsible.

556
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,505
That's enough. Ward, take them away.

557
00:36:14,589 --> 00:36:16,007
Go, George.

558
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,384
- Sam, I am innocent.
- Let's go, Francis.

559
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:19,468
- Wait.
- Help me, Sam.

560
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,180
- Wait.
- Wait. Sam, I am innocent.

561
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,806
Help me.

562
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:25,224
Go.

563
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,601
- Sam, help me.
- Go ahead.

564
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,894
- Sarge…
- Hold on.

565
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,228
- Sarge.
- Why did you kill my son?

566
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,813
Mr. Basil.

567
00:36:31,397 --> 00:36:33,858
- You're an animal.
- Galvan, that's enough.

568
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,739
Mother… Mother?

569
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,909
Mother… Mother…

570
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,669
You know… I just thought…

571
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:57,298
even if our baby will grow up

572
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,009
without a father and grandfather,

573
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:01,636
he is still lucky…

574
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,682
because we're both his mothers.

575
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:13,189
I want us to be equal.

576
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,650
We'll be co-parents.

577
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:17,193
We will raise him.

578
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,820
We will introduce him to the world

579
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,074
as the son of Georgina and Samantha.

580
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:31,249
Even if Basil
and Paco are gone, we'll do our best.

581
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,130
I have another idea. Come here.

582
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,094
Is it possible,

583
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:46,389
after all the problems
with the Palacioses,

584
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,475
let's leave that place together.

585
00:37:50,476 --> 00:37:55,982
You, me, baby, Auntie Ruth,
mother, and Ward…

586
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,234
Let's all live in one house.

587
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,611
We'll be a blended family.

588
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,448
Is that okay with you?

589
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:08,536
Let's talk about that next time.

590
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,999
Go ahead and rest first.
Just catch some sleep.

591
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:28,222
That's when the Palacios' hidden secrets
started to appear.

592
00:38:56,959 --> 00:39:01,422
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I disturb your catfight?

593
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,301
And who the hell are you?

594
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,388
I'm Bev. Beverly Maison.

595
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:15,936
Hello, babe…

596
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,356
Babe, I have good news.

597
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,277
Girlfriend of Basil.

598
00:39:30,451 --> 00:39:31,911
You won a million.

599
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,250
George, come.

600
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,710
Get your prize.

601
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:42,171
One million pesos.

602
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:44,006
- Yes.
- It's okay, Dad.

603
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,425
Give that to someone else.

604
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:49,095
Are you rejecting a blessing?

605
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,680
But, that's for you.

606
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,308
I said I don't want it.

607
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:58,771
Just take it as a consolation.

608
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:03,818
Or you can use this money
for you to buy a baby…

609
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:17,248
since you can never conceive one.

610
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:25,339
What?

611
00:40:26,882 --> 00:40:29,885
George cannot conceive a baby?

612
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:35,724
Didn't they know that you're barren?

613
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:39,687
Is this true?

614
00:40:40,396 --> 00:40:42,440
George is barren?

615
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,861
That's not true, Beverly is just lying.

616
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:50,948
Since when did I lie?

617
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:55,077
When I said Basil and I are having a baby,

618
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:59,623
I was telling the truth,
and the DNA test confirmed it.

619
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,544
I may be a mistress, but I'm not a liar.

620
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:05,754
Unlike you.

621
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:19,643
Both of you, let's discuss this privately.

622
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:22,229
It's embarrassing for the guests.

623
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,400
George is more embarrassing
because she's lying to all of you.

624
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,777
You, shut up.

625
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,780
Your daughter is barren
and she couldn't give Basil a child.

626
00:41:31,864 --> 00:41:33,324
You, shut up.

627
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,326
You don't know what you are talking about.

628
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,370
But I do, George. I do.

629
00:41:38,454 --> 00:41:41,582
And that's the thing
about the truth, it stings.

630
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,253
George, let's go.

631
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,214
Maybe the rumors are true.

632
00:41:51,634 --> 00:41:55,387
That when Basil found out
George couldn't give him a child,

633
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:57,389
he wanted to leave her.

634
00:42:00,017 --> 00:42:01,602
That's why you killed him.

635
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,828
That's roughly around ten million pesos
worth of jewelry.

636
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:22,581
You can have all of it.

637
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,671
I just want one thing in return.

638
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:31,507
I will not leave this house.

639
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,509
I want your baby.

640
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,846
After you give birth,
you will give the baby to me.

641
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:42,685
I will raise him
and treat him as my own child.

642
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:02,580
You can keep your diamonds.

643
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:04,582
My baby is not for sale.

644
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:07,293
Basil married me.

645
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:12,089
I am his wife.
That's why I should carry his child,

646
00:43:12,172 --> 00:43:13,299
not you.

647
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:15,718
Then why didn't you?

648
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,473
How much do you want?

649
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:25,728
Fifteen Million? Twenty Million?
Name your price.

650
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,563
Even if I do,

651
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:29,732
you can't afford it.

652
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:31,942
You see…

653
00:43:32,651 --> 00:43:36,030
this baby is priceless.

654
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,325
After I give birth,

655
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,828
I can get even more
than what you can offer.

656
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,646
Promise me we'll stop George.

657
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:10,064
We will do the right thing.

658
00:44:10,147 --> 00:44:11,899
But, I hope she'll listen to us

659
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,068
because it seems
she has decided on her plan.

660
00:44:14,151 --> 00:44:15,944
Please, stop crying.

661
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:20,407
Why don't you stop crying
when I'm the one carrying you?

662
00:44:20,491 --> 00:44:22,326
Are you hungry?

663
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:23,869
NEXT EPISODE

664
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:25,579
You need your mommy.

665
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,456
You're looking for her.

666
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,832
We have a lead.

667
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,209
They have found
the possible whereabouts of Ms. Samantha

668
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,669
and Ms. Georgina.

669
00:44:31,752 --> 00:44:35,089
I can't steal her baby from her.

670
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:36,840
<i>Mom, I am not that evil person.</i>

671
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,301
I still have a conscience.

672
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,095
George!

673
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,017
George!
