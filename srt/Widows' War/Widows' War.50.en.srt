1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,849
When I became a part of this family,

2
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:19,102
I didn't know
who or what to believe anymore.

3
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:21,312
You are all hiding something.

4
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:24,774
Do you have a suspect
for who ran over Mr. Castillo?

5
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:27,485
My mother-in-law, Aurora Palacios.

6
00:00:27,569 --> 00:00:29,487
<i>Can we have a ceasefire for now?</i>

7
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,323
Let's celebrate George's return.

8
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:35,910
Let's take a moment
to grieve for the Castillos.

9
00:00:36,494 --> 00:00:38,246
Why? What happened to the Castillos?

10
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,956
Francis is gone.

11
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:43,209
Are you the mastermind or…

12
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:44,502
‪PREVIOUSLY

13
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,921
someone you ordered?

14
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,466
Stop accusing Ma'am Aurora.

15
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,301
Just leave, Sir Galvan.

16
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:53,052
Who are you to tell me that?

17
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,347
And whoever the mastermind is
that Iñigo was talking about,

18
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:58,058
I hope he succeeds

19
00:00:58,141 --> 00:00:59,934
in killing all of you.

20
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:02,145
From the youngest to the oldest!

21
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,234
Juliet, let's go.

22
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,026
Mother…

23
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,864
Do you want to look at Francis?

24
00:01:56,407 --> 00:02:00,703
This is the last time
we will see him and be with him.

25
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:09,754
George…

26
00:02:09,838 --> 00:02:11,422
What now?

27
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:17,053
Juliet doesn't know who the mastermind is.

28
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:21,057
But she's so mad at the Palacios.

29
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,892
She wants all them to die.

30
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:25,895
This is Iñigo's fault.

31
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,480
He didn't tell you right away

32
00:02:27,564 --> 00:02:29,607
that there was a mastermind
when he kidnapped you.

33
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,194
He waited until he was about
to escape before he talked.

34
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:38,074
He's an animal. Now, what?
You're still in danger because of him.

35
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,964
Who is that from?

36
00:02:53,631 --> 00:02:56,676
Ms. Aurora Palacios sent this, ma'am.

37
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,348
That woman is really something else.
She's so shameless.

38
00:03:02,432 --> 00:03:04,934
She's a fool! She's an animal!

39
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:07,645
She's a demon. She's a demon!

40
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,230
Tell her not to come here!

41
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:11,566
She's a demon. She's a demon!

42
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,736
Animal! Animal.

43
00:03:15,904 --> 00:03:17,822
Yes, Barry.

44
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:21,993
I intentionally sent Samantha
those colorful flowers

45
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,453
so she'd be pissed off.

46
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:28,374
I know it's petty, but it felt good.

47
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,627
<i>You're evil.</i>

48
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:35,089
<i>She is already grieving</i>
<i>and yet you taunted her?</i>

49
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,675
Imagine, that stupid woman

50
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:40,094
attacked me.

51
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,805
If only she weren't
carrying my grandchild,

52
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,934
I would've thrown her out
of here a long time ago.

53
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:51,689
Madam…
Sergeant Royales wants to talk to you.

54
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:56,486
Barry, something has come up.
I will call you back.

55
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:00,823
Mom…

56
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:03,910
Can we stop blaming others?

57
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,746
That's what we've been doing
all our lives.

58
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,374
It's really his fault.

59
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:15,630
Mom, I'm also mad at Iñigo,
but there's nothing we can do.

60
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,091
The guy is already dead.

61
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:21,261
Mom, that's enough.

62
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:41,948
What do you need?

63
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,535
We want to ask you questions

64
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:47,370
about what happened to Mr. Castillo.

65
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,038
No.

66
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:53,126
I won't answer any of your questions,
Sergeant Royales,

67
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,462
because I have nothing to do
with Francis' death.

68
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,481
Sam.

69
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,411
Girl, drink water.

70
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:32,457
Are they your friends?

71
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,003
They are…

72
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,256
my <i>batchmates</i> in the sorority.

73
00:05:41,632 --> 00:05:43,468
Girl, if you only had sisters like them.

74
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,845
Never mind, don't bother.

75
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:50,016
Sisterhood is about protecting each other,
not destroying one another.

76
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,311
I don't have a friend on the campus.

77
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,315
Well, you have one now.

78
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,233
Georgina.

79
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,822
That's okay.

80
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,033
Sam.

81
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:08,993
Nice to meet you, Sam.

82
00:06:18,252 --> 00:06:21,089
Ms. Aurora, this is a serious matter.

83
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:23,508
We're talking about murder.

84
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,385
Refusing to answer questions

85
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:28,137
could raise more suspicions,

86
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,932
especially when you mentioned threats.

87
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:32,433
You can call your lawyer.

88
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,895
I already said, Sergeant Royales,

89
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:38,022
with or without a lawyer,

90
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:42,443
I am not answering any questions.

91
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,904
Are you deaf, Sergeant Royales.

92
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,364
I heard you.

93
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,034
But remember this.

94
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:55,540
If we find compelling evidence
tying you to Mr. Castillo's murder,

95
00:06:56,124 --> 00:07:00,711
you may be compelled
to cooperate in a more formal setting.

96
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:02,630
George…

97
00:07:20,898 --> 00:07:23,860
You think you can threaten me?

98
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,154
And you think you can intimidate us?

99
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,071
No.

100
00:07:27,155 --> 00:07:30,783
Ms. Aurora, just answer our questions.

101
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:32,952
If you keep silent,

102
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:35,413
we'll think that you're hiding something…

103
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:40,251
Or that you have something
to do with Francis Castillo's death.

104
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,884
George, how are you?

105
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,052
Did Iñigo hurt you?

106
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,054
No.

107
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,975
But I can never forgive him
for what he did to me.

108
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,520
I thought I was going to die, Sam.

109
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,856
When he was shot, I thought I was next.

110
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:07,195
It's okay. You're safe now.

111
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,990
No. Nobody's safe yet, Sam.

112
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,368
Maybe Sergeant Royales
has told you already

113
00:08:14,452 --> 00:08:16,871
that there's a mastermind.

114
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:19,081
I was here the whole time

115
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,042
when Francis was run over.

116
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:25,338
Check the freaking CCTV footage
of my house.

117
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,804
Can we know who you called on your phone?

118
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:36,224
Tell it to me straight, Sergeant Royales.

119
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,226
Do you want to know

120
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,479
if I called someone to give orders?

121
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,315
There.

122
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:49,278
Call all the people
I spoke with during that time.

123
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,782
What else?

124
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,368
Do you also want to search
for the stupid mask

125
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,453
that the attacker was wearing?

126
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,913
Go ahead.

127
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:03,209
Check my entire house.
You won't find anything.

128
00:09:03,292 --> 00:09:05,628
Juliet is Iñigo's accomplice,

129
00:09:05,711 --> 00:09:09,632
but she doesn't know
who the demon mastermind is either.

130
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,929
That's why we need
to be careful right now.

131
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,349
How about the baby? Is your baby okay?

132
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,685
Did you already have a checkup?

133
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,103
Yes.

134
00:09:22,186 --> 00:09:25,189
We dropped by the OB before we came here.

135
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,361
Sam, Mom said you were worried for me.

136
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:38,077
Thank you for your concern, Sam.
And thank you for your prayers.

137
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,788
How much is that?

138
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,711
Include this.

139
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:53,926
Here's my contribution.

140
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:00,766
Our superhero is here.

141
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:02,977
What are you talking about?

142
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,770
You're trying to be humble.

143
00:10:04,854 --> 00:10:08,190
No wonder you move that way
because you're a soldier.

144
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,860
And that's the reason
why Sergeant Royales is asking you

145
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,194
to help out in the investigation.

146
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,741
How about you? How are you coping?

147
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,245
It's difficult.

148
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,250
It's painful.

149
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,254
But I'm trying to handle it.

150
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,218
I know it's difficult but…

151
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:40,264
don't let that affect you.
Your baby might get affected too.

152
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,563
But… the killer is so sly, right?

153
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,315
No one can capture the killer.

154
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:52,693
And now there's a mastermind too.

155
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:54,236
Yes.

156
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,698
And speaking of mastermind,
does Sarge have an update yet?

157
00:10:58,407 --> 00:10:59,533
Not yet.

158
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:05,206
Why don't you ask Juliet Gambao?

159
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,833
Well, she didn't know

160
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:10,378
that Iñigo was conniving
with someone else.

161
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:20,054
You also saw the Palacios killer?

162
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,392
Yes.

163
00:11:24,475 --> 00:11:29,230
Just like the one who attacked you,
he was wearing a vintage gas mask.

164
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:31,273
But I think it's Mom Aurora…

165
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:35,111
or whatever demon she ordered.

166
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:50,501
So it was her or someone she ordered
who attacked me before?

167
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:14,150
You know, Mercy…

168
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,446
When George was kidnapped,

169
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,325
I almost went crazy with fear

170
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:25,786
that I would never see her again.

171
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,417
That's why I understand how you feel.

172
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,465
But I hope you won't…

173
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,843
let sadness defeat you.

174
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:52,354
That's okay. At least…

175
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:54,148
- We have something, right?
- Yes.

176
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:55,608
That's not bad.

177
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,067
This is a lot.

178
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,402
Yes.

179
00:12:58,486 --> 00:12:59,904
Good morning.

180
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:04,783
Jericho.

181
00:13:10,539 --> 00:13:12,875
You will bury Francis right away?

182
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,085
Why are you in a hurry?

183
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,215
To get rid of the pain.

184
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:24,345
So I can focus on finding justice for him.

185
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,682
Sam, I'm worried.

186
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,227
What you're planning to do is dangerous.

187
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:34,688
Why don't you leave the police
to investigate?

188
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,816
I won't be at ease if I don't do anything.

189
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:41,487
Let's go.

190
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:04,260
No matter how many times
you ask me, Sir Galvan,

191
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:08,639
I will tell you the same thing
about why I left the military.

192
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,058
And why I went to Palacios.

193
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,351
It's family.

194
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:15,688
Wait. Why…

195
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,942
don't you ask for help from Jericho?

196
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,152
He's a soldier. He can help.

197
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,073
- He's a soldier?
- Yes.

198
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,492
He was with Sergeant Royales

199
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:30,244
when I was rescued from being kidnapped.

200
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,246
Do you want me to talk to him?

201
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:41,297
Why?

202
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,176
Because that's what I don't have.

203
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,889
I grew up with my auntie…

204
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,516
because my mother died.

205
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:55,519
But she said…

206
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:57,771
that my father was alive.

207
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,984
That I should look for him and his family.

208
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:05,654
I have been looking for you
for a long time.

209
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:09,033
And when I saw you,

210
00:15:09,992 --> 00:15:11,660
even if…

211
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,246
this family is such a mess,

212
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:19,376
I said you are still my family.

213
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,005
That's why…

214
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,382
I'm sorry.

215
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,303
I won't leave.

216
00:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,056
I never thought this would happen.

217
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:34,475
After what happened to us.

218
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:36,977
You are still here.

219
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:40,064
Let's just bury the hatchet, Sam.

220
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,274
Let's not mention the past.

221
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,693
I don't want to.
Let's just focus on the present.

222
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,658
I really need someone right now, George.

223
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:56,497
Even if you throw me out
and do not accept me,

224
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,958
I won't leave.

225
00:16:01,418 --> 00:16:03,629
As long as my family is in danger,

226
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,340
I will stay here.

227
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,803
You can curse me, yell at me,

228
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,389
point a gun at me, or push me away.

229
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:17,142
But I will always come back.

230
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,314
I will protect my family.

231
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,862
Thank you…

232
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:33,617
And forgive me.

233
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,297
Mother still can't accept
that Francis is gone.

234
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,886
I need someone to lean on
because I might give up too.

235
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,305
I won't let that happen.

236
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,767
Sam, you just don't need anyone.

237
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,894
You need a friend.

238
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,855
You need me as much as I need you.

239
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:05,816
I'm just trying to be strong.
But deep inside, the trauma brought about

240
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:08,027
by what happened to me is still there.

241
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,448
I'm also here if you need
someone to talk to.

242
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:14,283
Samantha.

243
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,243
You bitch.

244
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:28,172
You're so shameless
to have me investigated.

245
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,049
What are you doing here?

246
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,467
Didn't I say

247
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,469
that you're not allowed to set foot here?

248
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,304
If you don't want us
to disrespect each other,

249
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,264
don't disrespect my brother's wake!

250
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,390
No.

251
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,226
If you want me to leave, Samantha,

252
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:43,520
take back your accusations about me.

253
00:17:43,604 --> 00:17:45,105
I won't take back anything.

254
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:47,775
You killed Francis.

255
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,276
You have no proof.

256
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,153
For now.

257
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,613
But I won't stop

258
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:53,947
until I find evidence

259
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:55,365
so I can put you in jail.

260
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,826
You won't find any evidence

261
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,621
because I didn't kill your brother.

262
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,458
Welcome to the family.

263
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,002
To our family.

264
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:25,312
Not long ago,
Sir Galvan was rejecting Jericho.

265
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:28,649
And he's a soldier.

266
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,026
Can he help?

267
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,029
He can help.

268
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:39,326
He can help make this family messier.

269
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,086
Auntie Aurora, please, just leave.

270
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,630
Shut up, Georgina.

271
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,173
And what are you doing here?

272
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,425
You're pretending to be nice to them?

273
00:18:55,509 --> 00:18:59,346
Not long ago,
you wanted to kill each other.

274
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:02,015
I'm warning you.

275
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:05,477
Leave before you regret coming here.

276
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,897
Why? What will you do, Samantha?

277
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:10,357
Will you slap me?

278
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,360
Will you pull my hair
in front of these people?

279
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,154
Well, go ahead.

280
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,459
Help me.

281
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,587
Let's help each other.

282
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,964
Let's save this family.

283
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,093
Because a family, no matter how messy,

284
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,637
even if they're fighting,

285
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:42,973
in times of troubles,

286
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,434
they should be siding with each other.

287
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,644
They should support each other.

288
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:54,860
Yes, Uncle Galvan.

289
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,508
Listen, everyone.

290
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:22,763
This woman is accusing me
of killing her brother

291
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:24,431
even though she doesn't have evidence.

292
00:20:24,514 --> 00:20:26,975
She's full of accusations,
but she can't prove it

293
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,644
because the truth is,

294
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,772
I didn't kill Francis.

295
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,358
Leave now.

296
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:35,734
One…

297
00:20:36,902 --> 00:20:40,405
Two, three. Now what?

298
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,828
- Sam, let go of me.
- Come here.

299
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,665
<i>Do you want to say goodbye</i>
<i>to the person you killed?</i>

300
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:51,959
Come here.

301
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,961
Say your goodbyes, Sam.

302
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:55,879
Now.

303
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:57,172
Sam, let go of me.

304
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,299
Let them deal with their issues,
woman to woman.

305
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:00,926
Move over, George.

306
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,929
Why are you fond of meddling
with Ma'am Aurora's fights?

307
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:04,972
You're such a sycophant.

308
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:09,434
Go ahead, tell my brother

309
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:10,394
that it wasn't you who killed him.

310
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,896
Tell him! Tell him!

311
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,356
Let go of me.

312
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,316
Let go of me, Samantha.

313
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,404
- Go ahead!
- Sam. Sam, that's enough.

314
00:21:20,487 --> 00:21:22,155
Let her go, Sam.

315
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:25,075
You're an animal!

316
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,327
- You're an animal.
- What? Are you not leaving?

317
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,288
- What?
- You're so shameless.

318
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:32,499
Now you know the feeling.
Remember that's what you did to me before?

319
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,377
Now, do it.

320
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:38,380
Go there.

321
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:44,094
Be thankful my mother
taught me to respect.

322
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:48,682
Because if she hadn't,
you wouldn't only get that.

323
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:16,501
I'm going to kill Samantha, Barry.

324
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,509
I will kill her!

325
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,345
Patience, my dear Auro.

326
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:32,142
Remember…
Your grandchild is yet to be born.

327
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,351
Why kill her now?

328
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:36,354
I want to snatch
my grandchild from her belly.

329
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,441
Relax.

330
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:41,651
<i>You can't get over it?</i>

331
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,070
I cannot.

332
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,530
I am extremely angry with that woman.

333
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,078
Francis…

334
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:55,624
Hug Dad tightly for me.

335
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,296
I love you so much.

336
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:14,851
I love you.

337
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:16,603
Sam…

338
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:31,159
You know, I see my sister-in-law in her.

339
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,786
Remember Jackie?

340
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:33,745
Your turn.

341
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:34,704
My turn.

342
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,458
I hope you're satisfied with what he said

343
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:39,709
and that it
has nothing to do with the case.

344
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:42,254
What makes you say that?

345
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:44,422
Did you talk to the detective?

346
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,634
Are you going behind my back too?

347
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,428
Are you hiding something from me, Barbara?

348
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:52,514
These witches.

349
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,226
They already stole our last names
by virtue of marriage

350
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,478
and they are the ones
who cause trouble in our families.

351
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:00,480
Exactly.

352
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:03,316
Barry, can we see each other?

353
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,861
I just want to vent my anger
and ill feelings.

354
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,156
Oh, I'm sorry. Not today.

355
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:10,866
I have an important appointment.

356
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:12,701
<i>All right, I have to go.</i>

357
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,869
Bye.

358
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,122
Simon, let's go.

359
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:35,974
Jericho, I need your help. I need…

360
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,809
Ma'am George mentioned it to me.

361
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,395
I will help you.

362
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,190
Let's find out who did this
to your brother.

363
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,734
Thank you.

364
00:24:45,817 --> 00:24:47,402
Thank you, Jericho.

365
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:53,033
Jericho is being a smart aleck.

366
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,868
That's nothing.

367
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,662
We got the response from the Telco.

368
00:24:57,746 --> 00:25:00,790
The sim used to call Iñigo

369
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:02,292
was illegally registered.

370
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,502
But they were able to trace the calls.

371
00:25:05,086 --> 00:25:08,089
Two calls were made through a cell tower
near the Palacios estate.

372
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,467
The last call connected

373
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,887
was made near Santo Niño Parish.

374
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,641
That's where Francis was run over.

375
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,227
Get out.

376
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:23,063
You are no longer welcome here.

377
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,149
I heard what happened.

378
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,151
How are you feeling, Aurora?

379
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,822
You're concerned? Oh please, Galvan.

380
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,367
After you accused me?

381
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,411
I didn't accuse you, Aurora.

382
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:39,788
I only asked you.

383
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,331
Asking me or accusing me.

384
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,209
They're the same bananas
with different colors!

385
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,878
You want to hear
that I have something to do

386
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:50,674
with Francis' death and Iñigo's shooting.

387
00:25:50,757 --> 00:25:53,677
Why? Galvan, why?

388
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:55,887
Because I know you did, Aurora.

389
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,931
I did not!

390
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:03,144
So it means,
that both crimes can be connected.

391
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:08,191
It's possible that whoever killed Francis
also killed Iñigo.

392
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,985
It's too early to jump to conclusions.

393
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:14,614
Francis getting run over almost coincides
with the shooting of Iñigo.

394
00:26:14,698 --> 00:26:17,575
It could be one person who did it,

395
00:26:17,659 --> 00:26:20,578
or it could be someone else.
We still lack evidence.

396
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,416
How about the gas mask? Did you find it?

397
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,210
It's not in Aurora Palacios' house.

398
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,644
What do you want from me, Galvan?

399
00:26:45,478 --> 00:26:46,646
The truth, Aurora.

400
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,482
So I could know how I can help you.

401
00:26:50,525 --> 00:26:52,652
And how I can protect you.

402
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:56,156
If you are really the person

403
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:58,867
behind what happened to Francis and Iñigo,

404
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,077
then let's work together.

405
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:04,706
Let's do something
so that you won't be caught…

406
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,708
like before.

407
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:11,880
Excuse me.

408
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,467
Sam, where are you going?

409
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,471
Miss.

410
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:24,476
Miss.

411
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:29,856
Sam, who was that?

412
00:27:31,608 --> 00:27:33,193
I don't know.

413
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,612
But she's been looking at me
for some time now.

414
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:41,409
I think she left something.

415
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,053
Jericho and I talked,

416
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:04,265
and he made me realize
the importance of family.

417
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:07,519
Aurora, it's just the two of us
still in this family.

418
00:28:08,269 --> 00:28:09,479
The real family.

419
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:13,858
The remaining full-blooded Palacios.

420
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,490
This is an old picture of Mom Aurora.

421
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,493
That's the gas mask behind her.

422
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:26,871
This is similar
to what was used by the person

423
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:28,915
who ran over Francis.

424
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:32,293
Mother!

425
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:34,587
Mother!

426
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,844
That's what the person
who attacked me before was wearing.

427
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,443
So let's be each other's ally.

428
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:57,610
Don't you want that?

429
00:28:57,694 --> 00:29:00,864
That's what I also want, Galvan.

430
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:06,244
For us to help and protect each other.

431
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,037
I welcome that.

432
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,959
Actually, I miss that.

433
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:16,671
You and me…

434
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,507
partners in crime.

435
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,721
But please, believe me, Galvan.

436
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,515
I am innocent.

437
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,771
I have nothing to do
with the death of Francis and Iñigo.

438
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,523
And I'm not the mastermind.

439
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,739
Simon, let's go.

440
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:44,157
Yes, ma'am.

441
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,290
If it's not you…

442
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:56,795
then good.

443
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,632
And from now on,

444
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:03,051
no more fights.

445
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,847
Come here.

446
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:36,084
Sergeant Royales.

447
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,723
Where did you get this photo?

448
00:30:51,391 --> 00:30:53,142
From someone anonymous.

449
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,353
It was given to Ms. Samantha

450
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:57,772
before Mr. Castillo' burial.

451
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,527
Okay.

452
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,488
This photo…

453
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:09,200
was taken in 1995.

454
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,412
This is the old Palacios Mining museum.

455
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:17,083
This is one of the things
Manuella Gamboa burned

456
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:19,836
when they went on strike in 1996.

457
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,966
Yes.

458
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,720
That's the group
of Juliet Gamboa's mother.

459
00:31:29,429 --> 00:31:33,850
So everything in this photo,
except myself,

460
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:37,562
got burned down and turned into ashes.

461
00:31:40,064 --> 00:31:42,442
I wonder who that woman is…

462
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,069
and why she wants to help me?

463
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,489
Don't think about that.

464
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,284
What's important is they gave you
some information.

465
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,912
Search it on the internet.

466
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,039
Palacios Mining Museum

467
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,916
was burned in 1996.

468
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,711
Did someone upload it
when it happened in 1996?

469
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,129
Just try it.

470
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,474
Here.

471
00:32:15,058 --> 00:32:16,559
Someone uploaded a scanned article

472
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:19,187
in Friendsbook.

473
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,980
Author J.G…

474
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,483
- Juliet Gamboa.
- Juliet Gamboa.

475
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,863
It seems that
what Mom Aurora said was true.

476
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,699
The museum got burned down in 1996.

477
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,788
But look, there are a lot
of comments here from J.G.

478
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:40,792
The people who rallied
have nothing to do with what happened.

479
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:48,257
Here. Look at the date.

480
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:52,053
May 1, 1996.

481
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:57,475
Were there casualties?

482
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:00,645
One. The guard on duty.

483
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,316
The evil people who were rallying
burned down the museum

484
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,276
during the night,
so there were no other casualties.

485
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:09,404
So, what?

486
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:14,283
Is there something else
you want to know, Sergeant Royales?

487
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:18,871
According to this article, there is a lot…

488
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,500
of mining equipment that was saved
from the burning of the museum.

489
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,379
But, look.

490
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:30,299
Look at the picture of the museum
compared to the picture of Mom Aurora.

491
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,344
It looks different.

492
00:33:33,428 --> 00:33:34,887
Look at the background.

493
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,226
It seems like it was taken here at home.

494
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:48,109
Could it be
that they are hiding the equipment here?

495
00:33:56,117 --> 00:33:57,243
Sam?

496
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,872
What are you and Jericho doing here?

497
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,334
Sergeant Royales, Sergeant Tupaz,

498
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:09,422
a lot of equipment was saved
from the burning of the museum.

499
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,718
Samantha, what are you talking about?

500
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:18,347
I read the article and I'm sure
you're hiding the equipment here.

501
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,934
Sergeant Royales, we still need
to search the house.

502
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,770
We already searched the house

503
00:34:23,853 --> 00:34:25,938
and we didn't find any vintage gas mask.

504
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,358
We will search Mr. Palacios' house.

505
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,361
You won't find anything, Sergeant Royales.

506
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,322
So you better stop this, please.

507
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:37,450
Okay, go look there
and I will search here.

508
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,577
Jericho, help me.

509
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,953
Let's go.

510
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,164
Where the hell are you going?

511
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:56,385
We have a search warrant

512
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,387
to search Mr. Palacios' house.

513
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:05,728
Sure, why not?

514
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:08,731
But you can't go inside Galvan's room

515
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,066
because that's his sanctuary.

516
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,902
No one can go in there but him, okay?

517
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,403
So, there is off-limits.

518
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:17,406
Miss, let's go to Mr. Galvan's room.

519
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,991
- Show me where that is.
- What?

520
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,076
- Wait!
- Over there.

521
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:21,369
- That's not possible.
- Sergeant Tupaz,

522
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:22,787
- You're not allowed there.
- let's start searching in the room, okay?

523
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:24,914
- Proceed now.
- Hey!

524
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:27,416
Hey. You're so stupid.
Why did you tell them where it is?

525
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,210
Hey, you can't go there.

526
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:31,629
That's an invasion of privacy.
I will sue you.

527
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:39,887
Samantha.

528
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,305
Jericho.

529
00:35:48,896 --> 00:35:51,607
Samantha. Jericho. Stop it.
Where are you going?

530
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,860
This is still my house.

531
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,624
Amando, go to the east garden.

532
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,626
Bring some guards.

533
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:11,878
Hurry up.

534
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:14,797
Ma'am Sam, what are we doing here?

535
00:36:14,881 --> 00:36:16,340
I'm looking for a passageway.

536
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,884
Maybe there's a secret room here.

537
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:20,469
You know the Palacios
are fond of secret rooms, right?

538
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,096
I was even locked up in one before.

539
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,360
Wait. Wait. This is prohibited.
What you're doing is not allowed.

540
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,862
- Search the cabinets.
- This is not allowed.

541
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,780
Hey, call the attorney.

542
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,157
Call the attorney.

543
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,159
Sergeant Royales, this is prohibited.

544
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,203
This is prohibited.
You can't enter his room.

545
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:47,872
Galvan said you can't enter his room.

546
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,081
I will make you viral.

547
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:50,416
I will take a video of you
and I will post it

548
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:52,293
on social media so that you will go viral.

549
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,377
This is not allowed.

550
00:36:53,461 --> 00:36:54,795
- Stop that.
- Ma'am Vivian.

551
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,965
The court has granted us a search warrant.

552
00:36:58,507 --> 00:36:59,926
We have a right.

553
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,636
- You read the warrant, remember?
- I don't care.

554
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,180
Galvan told me no one can enter his room.

555
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,473
- Go ahead and continue.
- Stop this!

556
00:37:05,556 --> 00:37:06,390
Go ahead.

557
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,100
- Proceed, guys.
- Galvan-- Who are you?

558
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,852
- Are you going to ransack this room too?
- Tupaz.

559
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,021
Get out of this room. This is prohibited.

560
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:13,022
What do you want?

561
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:13,981
- Let them check the other room.
- Are you going to steal from us?

562
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,108
Get out of here. Galvan.

563
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:20,112
Samantha. Jericho.
I told you to stop this.

564
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,948
Don't you dare try me.

565
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,116
Amando, stop her.

566
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,743
Don't meddle.

567
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:27,912
Jericho, there's something here.

568
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,538
Help me.

569
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,374
- Help me.
- Samantha, I told you to stop it.

570
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:33,709
Don't meddle! Why?
Are you hiding something?

571
00:37:33,793 --> 00:37:35,962
Sam. Sam.

572
00:37:36,045 --> 00:37:39,340
- Galvan, they are ransacking your room!
- Check the backboard.

573
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,300
What are you doing?
Do you want to steal from us?

574
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,843
- What are you doing?
- What's happening here?

575
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,805
- George, they're ransacking Galvan's room.
- Search every corner.

576
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,723
- They are searching the room.
- Check the bedside cupboard.

577
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,809
They are ransacking it.

578
00:37:50,393 --> 00:37:52,561
Galvan. Where is your Sir?

579
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:53,980
Ruth, where is Galvan?

580
00:37:54,063 --> 00:37:56,565
Galvan, come here.

581
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,693
- They are ransacking your room.
- What's the meaning of this?

582
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:01,404
Royales, get out of my room.

583
00:38:09,328 --> 00:38:11,247
I said get out of my room!

584
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:13,791
Sir.

585
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,256
Mom…

586
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:21,882
That's the mask of the Palacios killer.

587
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,576
Galvan…

588
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:53,289
Galvan, why do you have that?

589
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:56,125
Why do you have the mask of the killer?

590
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,127
Galvan, don't tell me that…

591
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,129
Don't tell me, Galvan.

592
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,297
No, you're not the Palacios killer.

593
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,507
Don't tell me
that you're the Palacios killer.

594
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,217
That's not possible.
We will be humiliated.

595
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,969
- We will be humiliated to the…
- Vivian, shut up!

596
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:48,844
One of our in-laws

597
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:51,222
is behind the killings, George.

598
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:52,556
They may be in cahoots.

599
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,225
The moment those two women's accusations

600
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:56,268
reach the media,

601
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,270
accusing us of being the murder suspects,

602
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,856
the shares of Palacios Mining
will definitely go down.

603
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,150
Do you think I will let that happen?

604
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,485
<i>Sergeant Tupaz, I was right.</i>

605
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,570
<i>I was right about my suspicions.</i>
<i>The gas masks are here.</i>

606
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:08,823
Sergeant Royales, they also
found gas masks here.

607
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,574
- Five.
- What? That's eight in total.

608
00:40:10,658 --> 00:40:11,992
<i>There are three missing.</i>

609
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:14,745
<i>Son, do you have something</i>
<i>to do with what happened to Francis?</i>

610
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:16,163
I will kill you, Francis!

611
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,623
- I will kill you!
- Stop it!

612
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:18,582
What's your plan?

613
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:22,044
Let's do what we did before
to José Beringuela.

614
00:40:22,128 --> 00:40:23,045
Another fall guy?

615
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,132
<i>We need to find out</i>
<i>who the real mastermind is.</i>

616
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,425
Who would it be this time?

617
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,218
<i>Someone from the household.</i>

618
00:40:29,301 --> 00:40:31,053
<i>Someone despicable.</i>

619
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:35,057
Problems must be eliminated by any means.
