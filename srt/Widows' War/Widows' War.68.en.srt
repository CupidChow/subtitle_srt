1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,517
<i>If Ma'am George and Sir Galvan had a plan,</i>

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,811
<i>it's possible that Ma'am George</i>
<i>kidnapped Ma'am Sam.</i>

3
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:24,107
<i>You solved both the AS3</i>
<i>and the Gustavo Royales cases.</i>

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,068
That's why I'm confident

5
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,820
that you'll solve this case too, Sarge.

6
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,989
And I won't stop until I solve this.

7
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:34,367
Don't cry, Baby Gilbert. Mommy's here.

8
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:35,285
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,202
George.

10
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,163
What happened to our baby?

11
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,080
Just rest.

12
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:41,416
That's where this family's deluge started.

13
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,084
You poisoned him.

14
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,044
- Well, that's ridiculous.
- You murderer!

15
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:47,922
The problem still hasn't been fixed.

16
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:49,048
You poisoned my child.

17
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,051
You animal.

18
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,012
I'll kill you.

19
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,599
That's when the Palacioses
hidden secret began to emerge.

20
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:59,059
I want your baby.

21
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:03,396
After you give birth,
you will give the child to me.

22
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,734
I will raise him
and consider him my own son.

23
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:11,571
Even though our baby boy will grow up
without a grandfather and a father,

24
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,449
he's still lucky
because we are both his mothers.

25
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,367
Let's live in the same house.

26
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,952
We'll be a blended family.

27
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,537
Let's talk about it later.

28
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,372
Okay, get some rest first.

29
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,832
<i>Take a nap first.</i>

30
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:28,087
The killings came one after another.

31
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,216
All those with Palacios blood
were targeted.

32
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,923
No one can know the truth
without me knowing

33
00:02:12,006 --> 00:02:13,716
the real reason why mine
and Rebecca's father died.

34
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,136
That's why you're so kind
to Ma'am Rebecca?

35
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:18,721
<i>You have the same father, right?</i>

36
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,882
Sam, there's blood.

37
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:38,092
There's blood…

38
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,146
Come back here. What are you doing?

39
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:53,441
Sam, it looks like
something happened to Peter.

40
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:02,951
Peter?

41
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,125
Peter?

42
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:19,968
Peter?

43
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,559
George, call an ambulance.

44
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,645
We need to get him to the hospital.

45
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:34,357
George, let's call an ambulance.
Call an ambulance.

46
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,695
Sam, he's gone. Peter's dead.

47
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,325
I didn't want this to happen.

48
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:48,079
All I want is
to get back what he stole. But, not this.

49
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:52,083
Who killed him, Sam? Who?

50
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:10,685
To this day, there's still no answer

51
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:15,815
to the question
of who is killing the Palacioses.

52
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,339
<i>I want us to be equal.</i>

53
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,968
<i>We'll be co-parents. We'll raise him.</i>

54
00:05:44,052 --> 00:05:50,433
<i>We'll introduce him to the world</i>
<i>as Georgina and Samantha's son.</i>

55
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,146
<i>No, Samantha.</i>

56
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:57,857
<i>I won't share him with you.</i>

57
00:05:58,357 --> 00:06:00,359
<i>Baby Gilbert is mine.</i>

58
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,029
<i>My son is mine alone.</i>

59
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,534
So, I convinced you all.

60
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:14,415
I guess I also convinced Sam
that I could forgive her.

61
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:21,339
Mom, I'll never stop being mad
at Sam until I die.

62
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,844
Wait, George.

63
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:30,223
So, you're just fooling Sam?

64
00:06:30,306 --> 00:06:31,641
Are you playing with her?

65
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:36,312
You're making her believe
that you've forgiven her,

66
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:37,772
but you will still sue her?

67
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:42,151
I really don't understand.

68
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,155
I'm not going to sue Sam.

69
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,158
I'm going to patch things up with her.

70
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,995
I'm going to make her believe
that we're okay again.

71
00:06:53,538 --> 00:06:54,997
I'm going to win her heart.

72
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,501
And once I gain her trust,

73
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,630
it will be easier for me
to get the baby when she gives birth.

74
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:06,342
I'm thinking Hong Kong.

75
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:09,053
No.

76
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:10,388
Europe.

77
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,102
I'll take Sam's future child there
and raise him.

78
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:18,813
I mean my future child.

79
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:30,199
My godchild, are you still
looking after him?

80
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,743
How is he? Have you been to your OB yet?

81
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,621
Not yet…

82
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,332
but I already have a schedule with her.

83
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:43,045
Sam, you should prioritize your baby.

84
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,424
I have a proposal.

85
00:07:46,507 --> 00:07:48,676
My OB is close by.

86
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:51,345
She's available for me anytime.

87
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:55,308
Do you want to switch OBs?

88
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,143
I can introduce you to her.

89
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,061
I'll always be with you
at your checkups too.

90
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:01,230
Will you do that?

91
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,940
Of course.

92
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:05,318
Since, you know…

93
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,112
I don't have a baby anymore.

94
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,240
I'd love to help you.

95
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,161
I want to be part
of your journey to becoming a mom.

96
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,122
That is if you'll allow me to.

97
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,041
Of course.

98
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,709
Of course, I'd love that.

99
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,423
George, you'll be the mother
of my child too.

100
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,259
Didn't I tell you,
you're not just a godmother?

101
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,178
You're his second mom too.

102
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,603
False alarm, Sam.

103
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,563
No cervical dilation.

104
00:08:42,647 --> 00:08:44,065
Your baby is stable.

105
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:45,942
Let's put this down slowly, okay?

106
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,902
- Just take it easy.
- So, Doc,

107
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,695
my delivery is still next week?

108
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,114
Most likely, yes.

109
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,951
Maybe you were just
stressed and overwhelmed.

110
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,122
That's why you had
Braxton-Hicks contractions.

111
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,042
I think she's stressed, Doc.

112
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,211
She's worried about her sister.

113
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,089
Sam, listen to me.

114
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,884
You have to focus on yourself.
The same goes for your baby.

115
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:16,556
Avoid thinking about
any stressful things around you.

116
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,807
Okay?

117
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,686
Oh, why?

118
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:23,688
What's with the face?

119
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,148
Nothing, I was just excited.

120
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:29,735
I thought I was going to see the baby.

121
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,239
Me too.

122
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,909
But, never mind.
You only have a week to wait.

123
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,831
We will wait.

124
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,138
So,

125
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,141
will Sam give birth next week, Kate?

126
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,351
No, George.

127
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:06,355
Based on her symptoms
and the baby's position,

128
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,107
she could give birth anytime.

129
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,234
What?

130
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,654
So, I need to do my plan.

131
00:10:14,155 --> 00:10:15,615
As in any moment?

132
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:18,075
Yes,

133
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,119
that's why you have to make sure

134
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,414
you're ready for what you're going to do.

135
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:25,958
Kate, I'm ready.

136
00:10:26,042 --> 00:10:27,543
I've been ready since last month.

137
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,964
Looks like I'm about
to see my Baby Gilbert soon.

138
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:51,085
George?

139
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,090
George?

140
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,687
<i>I want to be your baby's only mommy,</i>

141
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:12,857
in exchange of the child I lost
because of you.

142
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,733
George?

143
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,404
My child… my child.

144
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,783
Sarge, why are you
looking at me like that?

145
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,619
I was thinking,

146
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:28,831
maybe you know something
you're not telling me.

147
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:34,128
I have no idea either.

148
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:39,425
But, did you know
that I suspected Peter before?

149
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:42,303
But, he's dead.

150
00:12:42,928 --> 00:12:45,139
So, it's not Peter.

151
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:50,769
But, I also suspected Sergeant Casas.

152
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:52,563
Really?

153
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,064
Why?

154
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,151
That's the way it is, right?

155
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,361
You suspect almost everyone.

156
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,493
So, who do you suspect?

157
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:10,080
I studied all the videos
of his and Attorney Morales' conversation…

158
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:14,210
no other person was mentioned
in any of the discussions.

159
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:17,588
You know, I investigated Juliet again,

160
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,382
and I found out
that she really didn't know anything

161
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,885
about Attorney Morales'
alleged mastermind.

162
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:29,058
Sarge, my family's case
is really complicated.

163
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,729
The Palacioses aren't their only victim.

164
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:36,815
Even the killer has become a victim too.

165
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:40,653
Just like Attorney Morales.

166
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,739
Where is Attorney?

167
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,491
He followed the killer.

168
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:47,451
- Let's go to them. This way.
- Let's go.

169
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,869
Iñigo?

170
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,746
Iñigo…

171
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,706
Is she the one who stabbed you?

172
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,792
Yes, she's the one.

173
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,920
Attorney Morales betrayed Juliet.

174
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,130
But, Juliet betrayed him too.

175
00:14:03,425 --> 00:14:05,844
Who helped you sneak
into the Palacios estate?

176
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,054
The attorney.

177
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:08,430
Attorney?

178
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,598
It's Iñigo.

179
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:12,810
He's the one who
ordered me to kill Beverly…

180
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:17,648
and he's the one who killed Peter Pambid.

181
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,775
<i>How did you kill Peter?</i>

182
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:21,318
<i>I hit him in the head with a baseball bat.</i>

183
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,195
<i>His skull was fractured.</i>

184
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,827
Stay away from Attorney Morales.

185
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,204
He's one of the Palacios killers.
Juliet was his accomplice.

186
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:33,622
What?

187
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:38,085
George almost got in danger too.

188
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,131
- George, we have to go.
- Where are you taking me?

189
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,215
I'm not going with you.

190
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,383
- We have to go.
- Let me go, Iñigo.

191
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,343
- Let's go. Come on.
- Stop. Let me go, I said.

192
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:47,845
Hurry up.

193
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,514
Have you and Sam known
each other for a long time?

194
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:51,974
No.

195
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,269
Then why did you use
Francis' morphine as the poison?

196
00:14:55,352 --> 00:14:56,562
How did you get access?

197
00:14:56,645 --> 00:15:00,774
I wanted to kill Basil, but someone
got there first. The mastermind.

198
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:03,027
Who is the mastermind?

199
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:13,913
If we had found them sooner,
Iñigo might not have been shot.

200
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:17,625
And we would have learned from him
who this alleged mastermind is.

201
00:15:26,842 --> 00:15:27,885
Yes, Sarge?

202
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,227
We have a lead.

203
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:40,689
We have traced the possible whereabouts
of Miss Samantha and Miss Georgina.

204
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,449
George.

205
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:53,535
George?

206
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,047
George.

207
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,049
My child…

208
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,223
George.

209
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,774
Mom.

210
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:25,985
Mom…

211
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,488
Mom, what are we going to do?

212
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:32,992
Sam might have already given birth,
and George might steal her baby.

213
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,493
I don't know either, Son.

214
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,871
But, can we please not tell anyone yet?

215
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,999
Let's just wait for Sam's call first.

216
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:43,002
We will go to her.
Then we will talk to her, okay?

217
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:47,756
Yes, Mom. But, promise me
that we will stop George.

218
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,425
We will do what's right, okay?

219
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:52,011
Yes. I promise, Son.

220
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:53,971
I just hope she listens to us

221
00:16:54,054 --> 00:16:56,724
because she really seemed
determined to carry out her plan.

222
00:16:59,101 --> 00:16:59,935
George…

223
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:05,566
how was the doctor you recommended to Sam?

224
00:17:05,649 --> 00:17:07,359
That's all good, Mom.

225
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,988
I easily convinced Sam
to switch to Doctor Flores.

226
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:13,907
So, there are no more problems.

227
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,121
But, I don't know how
to convince Sam to have an ultrasound

228
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:21,290
with all her issues right now.

229
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:25,627
I need that as proof of the baby's sex.

230
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:29,173
George, whatever we get…

231
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,216
I will accept that.

232
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:35,512
Mom, I already talked
to my friend from Census.

233
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:37,097
They can't make a birth certificate

234
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:39,850
without identifying the gender.

235
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:43,228
I need that as proof that I am the mother.

236
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,648
You're really excited
to be a mother, George.

237
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,652
You're rushing everything,
even the birth certificate.

238
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,531
That is not everything
I'm dealing with, Mom.

239
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:59,036
I'm also preparing legal documents,
and processing the passport.

240
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:01,455
Why?

241
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,041
Because as soon as the baby comes out,

242
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:07,377
we will fly the baby
out of the Philippines.

243
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,340
She already talked to that Doctor Flores

244
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,635
who lost her license
because of malpractice.

245
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:17,262
And then, she also talked to the person
in charge with the documents.

246
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,265
If George is really that decided

247
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:22,976
then we must look for her
before Sergeant Royales finds her.

248
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,773
Because if not, George might fight back
and get in trouble.

249
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:29,191
Oh, no. You're right.

250
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,903
Gosh, why did I even support
your sister with her decision?

251
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,115
Mom.

252
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,284
Ruth, Edward. Sergeant Royales has a lead.

253
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:42,204
The police will find Sam and George.

254
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,548
It still won't start.

255
00:19:04,059 --> 00:19:05,185
Come on.

256
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:09,982
The sun's already up,
but there are still no cars passing by.

257
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,151
My child and I need to go faraway.

258
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,622
Baby Gilbert, stop crying.

259
00:19:25,706 --> 00:19:27,416
Baby…

260
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:31,670
Gilbert…

261
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,047
Baby Gilbert.

262
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,636
Why don't you seem glad with my news?

263
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,642
No, we're glad.
But, I still feel kind of nervous.

264
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,770
Because they still haven't found them.

265
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,274
That's why we'll be restless
as long as they're not here yet.

266
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,110
Well, don't overthink things.

267
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:58,739
Let's trust that Sam and George are safe.

268
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,868
They will come home to us.
That's why we should pray.

269
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:04,244
Come on. Let's pray.

270
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:18,467
George?

271
00:20:21,345 --> 00:20:22,554
George!

272
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:26,850
George?

273
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,232
George? George…

274
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,611
George.

275
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,534
George.

276
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,161
My baby…

277
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:50,582
Stop crying, baby.

278
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,087
Baby Gilbert, please stop crying.

279
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:03,303
Why won't you stop crying
whenever I'm the one carrying you?

280
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:05,180
Are you hungry?

281
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:16,984
You need your mother.

282
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,071
You're looking for her.

283
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,910
It's Sam.

284
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,625
I fooled her so I can get you from her.

285
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,053
Lord…

286
00:21:46,179 --> 00:21:47,639
Lord, I'm so sorry.

287
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,725
Please forgive me,

288
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:54,730
Lord, for my evil plan against Sam.

289
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,190
Lord, please forgive me.

290
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,414
There's a signal already.

291
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:23,258
Who art in Heaven, hallowed be thy name.

292
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,801
Thy kingdom come…

293
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,803
…as it is in heaven.

294
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,930
Give us this day our daily bread.

295
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,651
Ruth, who is calling?

296
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:46,406
It's just a number, but continue praying.

297
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,491
I'll just answer the call.

298
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,080
Hello, George.

299
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,040
Where did you take Sam?

300
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,502
George?

301
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,755
Is that the cry of a baby?

302
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,924
Yes, Mom.

303
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,510
Sam gave birth earlier…

304
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:09,846
But Mom, I can't do it.

305
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:11,389
I can't.

306
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,849
Huh?

307
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,060
What's the thing that you can't do?

308
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:19,189
I couldn't steal her baby from her.

309
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,651
Mom, I'm not that kind of evil person.

310
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:25,153
I still have a conscience.

311
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,822
Thank you, Lord.

312
00:23:27,489 --> 00:23:28,949
Really, George?

313
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:30,700
Yes, Mom.

314
00:23:32,202 --> 00:23:35,539
I don't want to seek revenge on Sam.

315
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:41,628
I know she didn't mean
what happened to me and my baby.

316
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,548
Mom, she's my best friend.

317
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,591
We patched things up already.

318
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,845
Sam?

319
00:23:54,516 --> 00:23:56,476
Let's just bury the hatchet, Sam.

320
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,228
Let's not bring up the past.

321
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,397
I really need someone right now, George.

322
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,940
You need me as much as I need you.

323
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,860
Same thing with me,
if you need someone to talk to.

324
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,447
Mom, I don't want us to fight again.

325
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:11,992
I don't want to.

326
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:16,955
That's why I'll return her baby to her.

327
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:19,916
George.

328
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:23,920
I'm so happy you changed your mind.

329
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:28,800
As of now, Sergeant Royales
and his men are looking for you.

330
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:33,597
So, let me know where
they will go so I can inform Sarge.

331
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:37,851
Yes, Mom.
And send an ambulance too, please.

332
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,104
Okay, George.

333
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:54,618
Excuse me, Mercy.

334
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:55,911
It was George who called.

335
00:24:58,288 --> 00:24:59,623
She and Sam are safe now.

336
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:01,374
They are safe.

337
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:03,126
And Mercy,

338
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:06,296
- you're a grandmother now.
- I'm a grandma?

339
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,547
Sam gave birth.

340
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:11,426
Sam has given birth.

341
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,220
- She's going home with her baby.
- Thank you, Lord.

342
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,930
- George is with her.
- My daughter…

343
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:16,806
Ward,

344
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,977
George will bring Sam and her baby home.

345
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,312
Thank you, Lord.

346
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,522
Thank you.

347
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,277
Thank you, Lord.

348
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,572
None of you informed me

349
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,368
that George and Sam
have been missing since last night.

350
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:42,415
Sir, Cairo and I tried to wake you up,
but you wouldn't wake up.

351
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,084
You were sleeping soundly.

352
00:25:44,167 --> 00:25:48,004
It looks like you had had
too much alcohol.

353
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:49,673
That's an emergency.

354
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:54,386
You should have forced me to wake up
even if you poured water on me.

355
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,643
You imbeciles.

356
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,647
None of you called
to tell me that Samantha

357
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,607
and Georgina are missing.

358
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:08,984
You're all fired!

359
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,486
Get out of here. Now.

360
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,113
Go.

361
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,160
And you?

362
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,788
What are you still doing here?

363
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,874
You're also fired.
I don't need you anymore.

364
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:29,838
You're just as useless
as those worthless helpers.

365
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,424
Try to fire me, Aurora.

366
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,427
I'll reveal your deepest secret.

367
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,514
Are you threatening my sister?

368
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,016
Are you?

369
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,143
Yes, Galvan.

370
00:26:44,102 --> 00:26:46,396
I'm tired of Aurora insulting me.

371
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,026
I've loved and protected her

372
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:53,695
for so many decades.

373
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:59,743
But, she has done nothing
but hurt and belittle me.

374
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,752
Do you love my sister?

375
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,796
Look at yourself.

376
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,716
You're just a servant.

377
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:16,968
You and Aurora don't look good together.

378
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,720
Do you know who is perfect for you?

379
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,972
A servant like you.

380
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:26,353
Take your illusions somewhere else

381
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:32,442
because Aurora will never fall
for a poor guy like you.

382
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,611
You're ambitious.

383
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,701
George!

384
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:43,828
Where is my son?

385
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:48,166
My baby…

386
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:52,003
George!

387
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,550
My baby…

388
00:27:58,885 --> 00:27:59,969
My baby…

389
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:02,806
I'm so sorry for worrying you.

390
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,557
Where did you take my son?

391
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:09,104
I was looking for a signal.

392
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,774
I brought him
because he might wake up and cry,

393
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,526
and wake you up when you need to rest.

394
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:17,112
But, he won't stop crying.

395
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,405
He is looking for you.

396
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,365
My God.

397
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:24,702
Maybe he's looking
for the scent of his mommy.

398
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:29,582
Look, he doesn't like me.

399
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:38,425
Come here.

400
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,224
My son,

401
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:49,144
this is your Mommy George.

402
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,022
If she carries you, don't cry.

403
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:57,026
She loves you as much as I love you.

404
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:00,530
Right, George?

405
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,659
Of course.

406
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:13,585
Did you find a signal?

407
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:17,213
Yes, the people who will
rescue us are on their way.

408
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,300
I also requested an ambulance,
so they can check on you and Baby.

409
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,093
Thank you, George. Thank you.

410
00:29:22,177 --> 00:29:25,555
My son.

411
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:30,018
George, why is my child turning black?

412
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,437
- What?
- Why is he turning black?

413
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,730
Relax. Relax, I know what to do.

414
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,273
What are we going to do?

415
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,776
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

416
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:39,944
Aurora fell for me, Galvan.

417
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,155
Something happened between us.

418
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,281
Amando…

419
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,657
Delusional.

420
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,785
I am Paco's father.

421
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,204
Amando, enough!

422
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,126
Aurora,

423
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,629
is that true?

424
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,219
You're disgusting.

425
00:30:04,302 --> 00:30:06,930
With Orly, I can understand it.

426
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,097
He's a doctor.

427
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,476
But, this poor guy…

428
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,353
Are you for real?

429
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:16,773
Does Paco know
that this jerk is his father?

430
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,733
No, of course not.

431
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:23,321
I am not stupid enough to tell Paco
about a night of my mistake, Galvan.

432
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:26,241
Amando, did you hear that?

433
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,409
You're just a mistake, so stop

434
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:30,829
with your illusions.

435
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:33,081
You're an animal, Galvan.

436
00:30:34,123 --> 00:30:35,625
You and your sister,

437
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,378
you belittle me…

438
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:41,256
as if I haven't done anything good
for your family.

439
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,217
I've given all my life

440
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:47,595
in serving Aurora and all of you!

441
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,348
You are so ungrateful.

442
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:54,102
You have no right to ask
for payment for debt gratitude.

443
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,020
We paid for all of your services.

444
00:30:56,104 --> 00:31:01,025
If weren't for us, your stomach
would be growling from hunger.

445
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,612
It's a good thing that Paco
didn't learn the truth

446
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:07,699
because he wouldn't accept
that you are his father.

447
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,702
Galvan.

448
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,288
- What's happening?
- His lungs are weak.

449
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:15,373
That happens to newborn babies.

450
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,876
- My God. My son.
- Baby Gilbert…

451
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:20,044
Baby… Son…

452
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:21,462
Baby, please.

453
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,591
- George, please. Help him, George.
- Please…

454
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:26,009
Oh, my God…

455
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,097
Oh, my God…

456
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,517
Baby, baby. Please.

457
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,019
Don't do this to me, Baby.

458
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:38,187
- Please, don't leave me,
- George, please…

459
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,731
- save my son.
- Baby Gilbert.

460
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,399
Oh, my God. Son…

461
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,026
My son…

462
00:31:45,028 --> 00:31:48,323
Please, Baby Gilbert. Please.

463
00:31:50,074 --> 00:31:52,452
Oh, God. Please help him, George.

464
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,038
- He stopped breathing.
- What?

465
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:58,291
My son. No, no, no…

466
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,459
George…

467
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,630
You are all demons.

468
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:07,342
You'd better be ready for me,
especially you, Galvan.

469
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:09,886
You will see…

470
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,348
how a poor guy seeks revenge.

471
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,059
Do you think I am scared
of someone like you?

472
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:17,518
Stop it.

473
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,979
Amando, get out of here.

474
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,442
Get out of my house. Get out of our lives.

475
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:40,917
Baby Gilbert, please don't leave us.

476
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,463
- George, please.
- Don't leave me. Son…

477
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,302
- Don't leave me.
- Son…

478
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:55,515
Thank God. You're okay, Baby Gilbert.

479
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,478
Thank God, Baby Gilbert. You're okay.

480
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:05,274
Baby Gilbert?

481
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,112
Really Aurora,

482
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,739
you fell for that jerk.

483
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:14,117
I was drunk Galvan.

484
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,077
But, go ahead,

485
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:17,578
insult me.

486
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,957
Go on. Laugh at me.

487
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,421
I'm too disgusted
to insult you or laugh at you.

488
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:32,051
You insulted me because I fell for Vivian,

489
00:33:32,135 --> 00:33:35,013
but it turns out you're worse than me.

490
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,432
You're cheap.

491
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,392
You're so cheap.

492
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,024
Wait…

493
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,735
I take it back.

494
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,529
I can't help but laugh at you.

495
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,086
I'm sorry…

496
00:34:07,587 --> 00:34:11,340
while thinking I named him Baby Gilbert.

497
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,760
In memory of Father…

498
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,054
but that's only on my mind.

499
00:34:16,137 --> 00:34:18,222
Don't worry. I'm sorry.

500
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:20,516
George.

501
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,187
You don't need to apologize.

502
00:34:25,646 --> 00:34:27,065
It's okay.

503
00:34:30,485 --> 00:34:34,614
We've been through a lot as friends.

504
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:39,619
And I think time has made us stronger.

505
00:34:39,702 --> 00:34:43,998
But, for the foundation
of our friendship to become stronger,

506
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,544
maybe we shouldn't listen
to what others say.

507
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,880
I agree.

508
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:54,675
Did you notice with our fights,
we easily explode right away

509
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,678
after hearing bad things about each other?

510
00:34:58,429 --> 00:35:00,932
We easily get mad…

511
00:35:01,015 --> 00:35:05,061
without knowing the truth from each other.

512
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,231
That's why from now on, George…

513
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,399
From now on,

514
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:14,112
if we hear something about each other,

515
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,030
let's calm down first.

516
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,699
Let's listen to each other's explanation.

517
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,992
Is that possible?

518
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,745
Yes.

519
00:35:22,829 --> 00:35:24,372
No more fighting.

520
00:35:25,081 --> 00:35:26,833
No more fighting.

521
00:35:54,902 --> 00:35:56,237
I'm sorry, my son.

522
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:10,042
Know your place in this house, Amando.

523
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,627
You are just my helper.

524
00:36:11,711 --> 00:36:17,216
You have no right
to comment on my personal affairs.

525
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,301
Now get out.

526
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,558
Amando,

527
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:30,938
not everyone we love
can love us in return.

528
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:36,611
I trust you with my life.

529
00:36:39,238 --> 00:36:42,992
I feel safe and protected
when I'm with you,

530
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:48,706
but that's just it for the both of us.

531
00:36:52,835 --> 00:36:56,255
It's a good thing
that Paco didn't learn the truth

532
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:59,592
because he can't accept
that you are his father.

533
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:18,694
Sam. George.

534
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:21,113
Thank God you are safe.

535
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,367
How are you and baby?

536
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:27,286
We're okay, Mother.

537
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,621
We needed to drop by the hospital,

538
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:33,000
so they can check baby, but we're okay.

539
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:34,919
Is this my grandson?

540
00:37:36,337 --> 00:37:38,339
It's yours and Auntie Ruth's grandson.

541
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:40,424
Really Sam?

542
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:42,218
Yes, Mother.

543
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,346
Because we are the baby's family too.

544
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,141
Thank you so much, Sam.

545
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,644
- Our Grandson
- Oh, so cute.

546
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,729
is so cute.

547
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,693
Jericho, did you carry out our request?

548
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,319
Yes, George.

549
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,363
We didn't tell anyone
that we already found you.

550
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:05,408
But, Uncle Galvan found out
from the head guard

551
00:38:05,491 --> 00:38:07,493
that you were missing last night…

552
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:12,039
That's why he and Auntie Aurora
came back right away from Palawan.

553
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:16,877
George, we'll still push through
with our plan.

554
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:19,547
What plan, Sam?

555
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:27,722
We just thought that once Mommy Aurora
finds out that the baby is here,

556
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:29,932
she will definitely get the baby.

557
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:35,313
That's why we've decided
to just stay away from here.

558
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:42,528
The Castilloses and Balayses will leave
this Palacios hell together.

559
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,782
Everything changed when the baby arrived.

560
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:52,246
We want to take him away
from all the troubles,

561
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:54,665
from all the Palacioses.

562
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:03,090
We asked Sergeant Royales to look
for the person who poisoned Basil,

563
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,968
the Palacios killer and the mastermind.

564
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:10,598
What's important for us is
the baby and his safety.

565
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:12,975
I agree with your plan.

566
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:16,520
I don't want
to put my nephew's life in danger.

567
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:19,565
I will help Sarge in solving the case.

568
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,778
As soon as I solve
the Palacios killer case,

569
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,739
I will focus
on your father's case next, Ms. Samantha.

570
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:29,033
Thank you.

571
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:33,954
If you need any assistance
with your transfer, just tell me.

572
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:37,249
And I also requested security
for the house you'll be transferring to.

573
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:39,627
- Thank you, Sarge.
- Thank you.

574
00:39:58,354 --> 00:40:00,147
So cute.

575
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:05,569
Cute.

576
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:08,823
You gave birth, Sam.

577
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:12,368
Can I

578
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:14,537
look at him?

579
00:40:16,455 --> 00:40:18,124
Can I look at

580
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,419
Paco's baby?

581
00:40:46,235 --> 00:40:47,945
Do you want to carry him?

582
00:41:06,964 --> 00:41:08,591
He looks just like Paco.

583
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,473
My grandson.

584
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:46,795
Ah,

585
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,131
I'm sorry.

586
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,592
I see

587
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,763
Paco as my son.

588
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,724
That's how I treat him.

589
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,309
That's why he's like

590
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,771
a grandson to me.

591
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,319
Sam,

592
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:17,117
take him away from this place
while you still have time.

593
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,623
That's already our plan.

594
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,001
Mom Aurora can't take him away from me.

595
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,920
You'd better hurry

596
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:32,132
before the Palacios killer attacks again.

597
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,063
<i>The Palacios killer killed Jomar.</i>

598
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:48,440
Dad, you're bleeding.

599
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,068
The Palacios killer is
still in the compound.

600
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:53,112
It's him.

601
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:54,029
NEXT EPISODE

602
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,323
Amando is the Palacios killer.

603
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,367
Aurora.

604
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:04,707
<i>The Palacios killer is inside</i>
<i>Auntie Aurora's house.</i>

605
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,001
<i>Mine baby and Sam's.</i>

606
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,587
Can I carry my grandson?

607
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,088
No.

608
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:13,674
<i>I will go where my grandson is.</i>

609
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:14,675
The child…

610
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:17,303
My son. My son.
