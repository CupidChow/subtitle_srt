1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:51,050
I won't hurt you.

2
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:52,135
Please don't hurt me!

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:53,803
Please.

4
00:00:53,887 --> 00:00:55,388
- Louie, help me!
- Sofia.

5
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:58,266
PREVIOUSLY

6
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:01,686
<i>Mommy!</i>

7
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,396
What's with you? Where have you been?

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,814
Where did you go?

9
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,734
It's dangerous outside,
and yet she was roaming around.

10
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,445
Did you ever even ask how I was doing?

11
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,739
Did you ever even ask if I got hurt?

12
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:17,327
<i>It's pointless hoping that I will get</i>
<i>the love I deserve.</i>

13
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,704
Is true that you attacked Sofia?

14
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,956
Do you also believe that I'm a bad person?

15
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,416
I'm not the one
killing the Palacios family.

16
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:25,001
- Then who is?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

17
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:26,586
All I know is that you're not safe.

18
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:29,005
Uncle!

19
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,840
<i>I will kill you, Jerico!</i>

20
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,843
You will regret the day you were born!

21
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:35,678
<i>Finally, I'm free.</i>

22
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:36,638
Attorney, thank you.

23
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,931
I was just doing my job.

24
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,975
You should thank Madam Aurora Palacios.

25
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,436
Regardless of whether
she helped us or not,

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,355
my brother would have
gotten out of prison.

27
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,856
And I've made my decision.

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,399
We're leaving this house.

29
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:51,653
When do we tell Sam that I'm here?

30
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:53,947
No one will know that you're here.

31
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:57,158
Not even your wife.

32
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,034
Rebecca?

33
00:01:58,118 --> 00:02:05,166
Is it true that Sam's brother has returned
to Aurora's house?

34
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,294
Meanwhile, your brother

35
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,379
is still wanted.

36
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:12,340
<i>Sofia, my child,</i>
<i>don't be upset because of Daddy.</i>

37
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,092
All I wanted

38
00:02:14,175 --> 00:02:17,262
was a complete and normal family,

39
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:21,558
where I am not embarrassed to say
that I am Sofia Palacios.

40
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:25,311
On your birthday, I will introduce you
to the public as my daughter

41
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,814
and the next heir of the Palacios family.

42
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:29,107
<i>Thank you, Daddy.</i>

43
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,984
Jerico is innocent.

44
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,485
Someone framed him.

45
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:36,322
I believe that your brother
was just framed.

46
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,157
By who?

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:42,996
Who is happy right now because
their family is all together again?

48
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,845
Only death can pay for life.

49
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:06,269
Only death can save Jerico.

50
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:37,508
Sam!

51
00:03:41,429 --> 00:03:42,639
No, Rebecca!

52
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:54,234
You should die!

53
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,364
Jerico is a Palacios

54
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,199
and he is also the killer?

55
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:07,497
They found evidence in his room
connecting him to the murders,

56
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,374
including Basil's.

57
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:18,258
Jerico killed his relatives, Inigo.

58
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:21,010
Basil. Beverly's baby in her womb.

59
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:23,054
But why?

60
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,266
Why would you kill your own family?

61
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:36,150
- Rebecca!
- Mother! Mother!

62
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,903
- Don't! Stop it, Rebecca!
- No! Let go of me!

63
00:04:38,987 --> 00:04:39,904
Why?

64
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,781
My daughter didn't do you any wrong.

65
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,076
No, I need to kill Sam!
I need to kill her.

66
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,287
- Take her away.
- No!

67
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:48,329
What's with you?

68
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:50,581
- Rebecca, stop!
- Mother!

69
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,458
- Come here!
- Mother!

70
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,794
- Stop! Stop!
- No! Sam!

71
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,421
I will kill you!

72
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:58,923
- Ma'am, stop it. Ma'am, stop it.
- Get off me!

73
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:04,053
Let's just hope that
they catch Jerico right away

74
00:05:04,554 --> 00:05:08,433
so that finally,
justice can be done for Basil.

75
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,812
Thank you.

76
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,773
For what?

77
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,318
For being Basil's friend

78
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,194
and now mine.

79
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,031
I may have inherited Basil's money,

80
00:05:23,114 --> 00:05:25,325
but it can't comfort me right now.

81
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,410
You can.

82
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:31,289
Your friendship is a better inheritance
to me than Basil's money.

83
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:39,130
- No! Jerico can't go to jail!
- Hold her.

84
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,298
Or else…

85
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:44,552
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

86
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,262
Are you hurt?

87
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:47,722
How's our baby doing?

88
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:51,434
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

89
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,020
I don't want to!

90
00:05:55,354 --> 00:05:57,982
I heard the screaming.
What happened?

91
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,367
Rebecca was about to hit Sam.

92
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:10,328
I can't let that happen so…

93
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,581
Mama Aurora got hurt saving me.

94
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,832
Ma.

95
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:18,086
Why would my niece hurt you?

96
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:23,716
Because she's blaming me for
what happened to Jerico.

97
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,384
That's why she wants to kill me!

98
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:29,263
Jerico has poisoned Rebecca's mind.

99
00:06:29,347 --> 00:06:32,016
Our niece, Galvan!

100
00:06:38,064 --> 00:06:41,150
Even though you knew you'd get hurt,

101
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:44,904
you still chose that over letting me
and my baby get hurt?

102
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:49,534
I didn't do it just for the baby, Sam.

103
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,077
I did it for you.

104
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,287
Believe it or not,

105
00:06:53,996 --> 00:06:56,457
I love you like my own daughter.

106
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:01,129
And a mother won't let her child get hurt.

107
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:08,511
Are you sure you're okay?

108
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:39,584
That's Jerico.

109
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,472
Yes, that's him.

110
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:55,558
Call for backup.

111
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:01,981
All available units!
I repeat, all available units…

112
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:06,819
- Hello? I'm here now.
- Jerico!

113
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,490
- This is a setup.
- Don't run.

114
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,660
You better surrender!

115
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:18,057
Jerico!

116
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:20,351
I am innocent!

117
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:23,145
Someone else is targeting
the Palacios family.

118
00:09:23,229 --> 00:09:25,231
Investigate our family.

119
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,650
They are hiding a lot of things!

120
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,820
What things?

121
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,824
Find out where the body
of Rodolfo Palacios is.

122
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:37,243
And Rebecca too! Her ex.

123
00:09:37,326 --> 00:09:39,245
Jerico, come out.

124
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:43,124
I promise I will help you,
but just surrender first.

125
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,945
What?

126
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:56,155
Go ahead.

127
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,699
Jerico, don't.

128
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:21,764
Are we not leaving anymore?

129
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:25,101
Maybe not for now, Mother.

130
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,813
I pity Ma'am Aurora.

131
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,734
My conscience can't take leaving her,
especially when…

132
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:37,780
You risked your life to protect Sam?

133
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:40,991
I was protecting your child, Paco.

134
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:45,329
I would do the same for any woman
who was carrying my grandchild.

135
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:49,125
What if she takes your child?

136
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,257
I don't think she'll do that.

137
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,679
We talked last night, and she looked
sincere about what she said.

138
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,723
And if she betrays me,

139
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,686
I will face her in whatever court
we end up in.

140
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,399
So your heart hasn't softened for Sam.

141
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,028
That woman drove a wedge between us, Paco.

142
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,615
I can never forgive her.

143
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,832
That's right, Sam.

144
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,876
Be kind,

145
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,004
but be cautious.

146
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,257
A person who betrays you once

147
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,551
will betray you again.

148
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:45,055
But Rebecca…

149
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,308
what about her?

150
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:51,437
Last night, she was so eager to hurt you.

151
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:55,274
Ma'am Rebecca?

152
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:58,152
Ma'am Rebecca!

153
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,279
Ma'am!

154
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,655
Looks like there's no one there.

155
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,117
Maybe she had too much
of the sedative you gave her.

156
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,660
- What?
- Ma'am?

157
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,162
Where's the key?

158
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:09,872
Get the key and open the door!

159
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,294
We need to stay away from Rebecca.

160
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:21,217
But I was told that they'll add
more security and nurses for Rebecca

161
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,677
to keep an eye on her to guard her more.

162
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:28,974
Hurry.

163
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,267
Ma'am?

164
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:31,435
Ma'am?

165
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,103
Ma'am!

166
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:35,606
- Loray!
- What?

167
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:36,941
Look!

168
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,861
Oh no! Ma'am Rebecca's escaped!

169
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:45,741
I'll go to your brother first.

170
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,424
Who was it? Who pushed Sam?

171
00:14:43,924 --> 00:14:46,010
No one wants to answer? Okay, fine!

172
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:47,928
How about now?

173
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,014
Paco, that's enough!

174
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:53,809
If Sam gets hurt one more time
because of all of you,

175
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:56,604
I will kill you all!

176
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,107
I saved myself for the right man!

177
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,108
For you!

178
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,818
Sam, you're not leaving.

179
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:05,613
If you leave, I will kill myself!
Watch me!

180
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,448
I will go to your funeral.

181
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:09,867
Paco, what are you doing?
Have you gone crazy?!

182
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,243
- Stop it.
- Sorry, Sam.

183
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:30,179
Amando, what are you doing here?

184
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,973
I will just check on Sir Paco.

185
00:15:34,433 --> 00:15:35,893
He's resting.

186
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:41,482
You don't believe me, Amando?

187
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,776
My son is resting.

188
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,155
Madam,

189
00:15:48,906 --> 00:15:51,408
what you did, hiding Sir Paco here,
is wrong.

190
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,128
Paco, please, wake up, my son.

191
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,965
Please.

192
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:16,058
Wake up, Paco!

193
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:23,232
Wake up!

194
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:30,072
You have no right to question me, Amando.

195
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,118
- I also have a right--
- Leave!

196
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:39,415
Amando, leave now, or else

197
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,168
you will never see Paco again.

198
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,601
What?

199
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:02,688
You mean Rebecca attempted to hurt Sam?

200
00:17:03,564 --> 00:17:05,232
Oh my God!

201
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,443
What if…

202
00:17:08,485 --> 00:17:11,739
Rebecca and Jerico
are actually helping each other?

203
00:17:12,322 --> 00:17:16,368
What if they are working together to kill
here at the Palacios' Estate?

204
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,371
That's impossible.

205
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,588
<i>What if you'd just told me the truth</i>
<i>about who you really were?</i>

206
00:17:27,671 --> 00:17:30,591
<i>That you were somehow involved</i>
<i>in my father's death?</i>

207
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,470
<i>Maybe I would've understood you.</i>

208
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,723
What do you mean it's impossible?

209
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,016
Galvan.

210
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:42,352
Rebecca is close to Jerico.

211
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,065
Don't you see?
Rebecca always helps Jerico.

212
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,901
Who knows? Maybe later,

213
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,361
it'll turn out that
they're helping each other

214
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,782
and that they want to kill off
the Palacios family one by one!

215
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:59,912
Rebecca is just mentally unstable.
She's not a murderer.

216
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:03,415
And so what? What will you do now?

217
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:07,044
Won't you at least have her locked up
in a mental hospital?

218
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,214
Of course not.

219
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,260
<i>Maybe you'd still be alive.</i>

220
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,514
<i>Maybe you'd still be with us.</i>

221
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,061
<i>Maybe you would have met our child.</i>

222
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,237
Her nurse is keeping a tight guard on her.

223
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,199
Galvan, Rebecca is dangerous!

224
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:38,534
She's capable of hurting others.

225
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:44,081
What if after this,
she hurts Sofia, our daughter?

226
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:45,916
What if Sofia is put in danger?

227
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:47,334
What then?

228
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:48,919
I won't let that happen.

229
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:51,505
No one is permitted to touch Sofia.

230
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,103
Sam?

231
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,110
Come with me to the third floor.

232
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:16,613
You'd better make sure of that, Galvan.

233
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,992
Because if something happens
to my daughter…

234
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:21,785
I'm sorry Galvan,

235
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,829
but even if she's a relative of yours,

236
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,914
she will rot in hell!

237
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,207
I swear.

238
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,002
Rebecca wouldn't do that.

239
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,846
Third floor?

240
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:45,100
But only you, Paco, and Amando
are allowed to go up there.

241
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,518
Nonsense.

242
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:49,980
You are my daughter, Sam,

243
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:54,026
so you are free to go to
any part of this house.

244
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:55,235
Come.

245
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:58,822
I'll show you the nursery for your baby.

246
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:00,282
Come.

247
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:01,241
Come on.

248
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:08,332
They should lock that crazy woman
in a mental hospital.

249
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,459
Ma'am…

250
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,501
What?

251
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,587
Do you spend your free time
hanging out at cockpits?

252
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,590
Why?

253
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:19,343
You're good with cockfights.

254
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:22,012
You were able to make
Ma'am Rebecca and Ms. Sam fight

255
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,472
without breaking a sweat.

256
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,022
I told you, didn't I?

257
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:39,071
My daughter will be
the sole remaining Palacios in this house.

258
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,407
Just you wait and see.

259
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:51,250
Ma'am Aurora! Ma'am Aurora!

260
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,086
Ma'am Rebecca is missing. She's escaped.

261
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:58,257
Why are you telling me that?
Why don't you look for her?

262
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,551
Maybe she hasn't gone far yet!

263
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,345
- Go!
- Okay.

264
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:11,812
Jerico, please.

265
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,815
Jerico, please, please, pick it up.

266
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,026
Where are you?

267
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,070
Jerico, please.

268
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:21,071
Please, Jerico.

269
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,157
Jerico, please.

270
00:21:24,908 --> 00:21:26,702
Ma'am Rebecca!

271
00:21:29,746 --> 00:21:31,081
Oh no.

272
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,125
I need you, Jerico.

273
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,377
Please, let's stay together.

274
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,508
Jerico, please pick it up.

275
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,427
Where could she be?

276
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,138
Ma'am Rebecca!

277
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,729
Ma'am Rebecca!

278
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:57,983
Why is she obsessed with that man?

279
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:02,779
When Jerico and I saw each other,

280
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:07,326
he mentioned to me that his father's body
and Rebecca's ex's body were both missing.

281
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,661
I told Jerico

282
00:22:10,537 --> 00:22:13,623
that our brother's body was lost at sea.

283
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,793
What is he thinking?

284
00:22:17,461 --> 00:22:21,006
That we're hiding the body of our brother?

285
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,218
What about Rebecca's ex?

286
00:22:32,434 --> 00:22:34,269
He was buried in the mines

287
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,938
and we couldn't retrieve his body.

288
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:38,899
Detective,

289
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,111
will you be able to help us find
Ma'am Rebecca or not?

290
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:45,572
We will do our best.

291
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,033
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

292
00:22:48,116 --> 00:22:49,409
I will walk you out.

293
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:50,744
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

294
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,525
Jerico is a Palacios

295
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,194
and he is also the killer?

296
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:28,281
Jerico killed his relatives, Inigo.

297
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:31,034
Basil. Beverly's baby in her womb.

298
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:33,245
But why?

299
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:36,206
Why would you kill your own family?

300
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,679
Uncle Galvan punched you?

301
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:51,847
Because he's a weakling.

302
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:54,641
He can't fight with his younger sister.

303
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,643
That's why he vents his anger on me.

304
00:23:57,352 --> 00:24:00,355
What's Auntie Aurora's hold
on Uncle Galvan?

305
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:03,108
I don't know and I don't care!

306
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:05,360
You know, I asked him that before,

307
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:07,237
and do you know what his answer was?

308
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:09,114
"Because we're family."

309
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,615
There are just two siblings left.

310
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,620
You know, this whole family…

311
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:18,331
this whole family, we're crazy!

312
00:24:19,916 --> 00:24:21,960
You're just saying that
because you're mad.

313
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:24,254
No. Listen.

314
00:24:24,337 --> 00:24:27,716
I have a father who doesn't have
the balls to go up against his sister,

315
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:31,178
an aunt who's a control freak,
a cousin who's a monster,

316
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,681
and another cousin
who literally has monsters in her head!

317
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:36,016
This whole family?

318
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,518
This whole family is crazy!

319
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,357
It seems I'm the only sane one
in this family.

320
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:48,945
Are you sane?

321
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:52,449
It looks like you're the craziest one
in your family!

322
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,786
Well,

323
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,872
you do know me the best.

324
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:02,876
But, you know,

325
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,463
it seems that, yes,

326
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,466
I'm crazy too, just like my family.

327
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:10,550
The Palacios?

328
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:13,553
It literally runs through our veins,
the craziness.

329
00:25:14,512 --> 00:25:16,473
One word to describe this family?

330
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,016
Crazy.

331
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,393
We don't deserve a place in this world.

332
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:33,073
Playing the hero to Sam was effective.

333
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,951
She and her family are no longer leaving.

334
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,160
Really?

335
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,287
Good for you.

336
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:41,498
Good for us.

337
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,292
I can look after Sam better.

338
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:45,669
I mean,

339
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:51,675
I can look after the baby
growing in her womb.

340
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:57,097
So all is well in the house
of Aurora Palacios?

341
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,015
Not really.

342
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,310
It's your troublemaker cousin.

343
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:03,812
Rebecca?

344
00:26:04,771 --> 00:26:06,314
Who else?

345
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:09,150
She is still missing even now.

346
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,904
She went crazy over her poor brother.

347
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:15,699
You gave us a hard time, Ms. Rebecca.

348
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,327
You know, if we'd failed to find you,

349
00:26:19,953 --> 00:26:22,747
most likely your Auntie would have said
we were useless.

350
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,833
Gosh, let me out!

351
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:26,751
My brother needs me.

352
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,962
Your brother is a killer.

353
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,507
Why do you want to go to him?

354
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,552
Are you his accomplice?

355
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:36,886
No!

356
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:39,973
My brother is not a killer.
Please believe me.

357
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:43,768
Why won't you believe that
my brother is innocent?

358
00:26:44,394 --> 00:26:45,770
But you're the police, right?

359
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:49,149
You shouldn't just believe things
unless you have evidence.

360
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,777
We already have a lot of evidence
against your brother.

361
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:55,238
It's not his!

362
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:58,408
What's with you? Someone just
placed it among his things!

363
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:01,328
My brother is innocent.
Jerico is innocent!

364
00:27:01,411 --> 00:27:03,079
Santos, hold her tightly.

365
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:05,081
Don't let her go, or she might escape.

366
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:06,458
I'll just call her aunt.

367
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,804
The police.

368
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,223
Good news?

369
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,267
I hope so.

370
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,646
Sergeant Villa?

371
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,106
Hello, ma'am.

372
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:32,567
We're here with your niece.

373
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:34,569
Thank God.

374
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:37,989
Finally, you did something right.

375
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:42,619
Ma'am, can you just say thanks?

376
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:46,331
Then thank you, officer,
for a job well done.

377
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,963
Your auntie is something else.

378
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,628
Oh my! Karma acts fast with the Castillos.

379
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:37,507
Francis was released from prison,
but Rebecca almost killed Sam.

380
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:44,264
Ma'am, you have a visitor.

381
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:52,021
I've noticed that he often visits you.

382
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:54,691
Maybe he's courting you.

383
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:56,776
- Inigo.
- Can I disturb you?

384
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,194
Of course. Have a seat.

385
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,321
- Coffee for our guest, please.
- Auntie.

386
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,907
Please, have some cake. Anything.

387
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:03,950
- Okay.
- Thank you, Auntie.

388
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:05,243
Okay, I'll leave you first.

389
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:06,536
Okay.

390
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,083
George, I already spoke to the police.

391
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,503
They say that Jerico is hovering
around the estate.

392
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:18,715
If he can even hurt his relatives,

393
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,010
what's stopping him from hurting
any one of you?

394
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:31,811
George, you need to be careful.

395
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:39,110
Basil, George loves you.

396
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,488
I'm a Palacios!

397
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,865
Of course everyone loves me.

398
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,450
For my money,

399
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:46,701
not for who I am.

400
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,328
Not everyone.

401
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,874
Basil, please, I'm begging you.

402
00:29:53,875 --> 00:29:55,710
Think about what you're planning to do.

403
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,129
Do you think I haven't thought about it?

404
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:03,134
I thought about my situation with George,
and that's why I have this plan!

405
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,971
What's with you? Release me!

406
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,890
- Sit down!
- Let me go!

407
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,017
What's with you?!
Ouch, you're hurting my shoulder!

408
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,524
It's you?

409
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,777
What you're doing to me is illegal.

410
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,570
- This is kidnapping!
- Shut up!

411
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,783
Sarge, this is wrong.

412
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,702
We'll get in trouble if he reports us.

413
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,289
What will you do?

414
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:34,707
Report us to the police?

415
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,335
Let me go!

416
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:40,129
Let's talk.

417
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:44,717
Why are you killing the Palacios family?

418
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:46,928
I'm not killing anyone.

419
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,430
Is it for the money?

420
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,936
And why do you have this?
Where will you use this?

421
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:01,234
But your plan is to murder your wife!

422
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,865
Your wife is just barren.

423
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,826
She didn't have an affair.
She's not a criminal.

424
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:11,828
So please, think about it.

425
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:13,037
You don't need to kill her!

426
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:14,247
She lied to me!

427
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,418
She made me believe that
we would have a child.

428
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,461
And that's a crime.

429
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,798
And it's only punishment is death.

430
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,633
By what law book?

431
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,469
Go ahead, Basil. Enlighten me.

432
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:31,264
I am a lawyer
and I haven't read anything like this.

433
00:31:31,347 --> 00:31:32,849
In my book,

434
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,684
if you fool me,

435
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,477
the only punishment is death!

436
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:39,272
But you can leave her!

437
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,025
There's no divorce in our country, Inigo.

438
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,694
Annulment. How about annulment?

439
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,780
That's such a long process.

440
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,825
We can't wait that long.

441
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,080
As long as George is alive,

442
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,166
I'll be tied to her
for the rest of my life.

443
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:04,088
I want to be free, okay?

444
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:05,965
I want to be free.

445
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,885
Not for me.

446
00:32:08,968 --> 00:32:10,345
For us.

447
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,265
Babe,

448
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:17,977
George needs to die

449
00:32:18,978 --> 00:32:20,104
for us.

450
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:34,118
Thank you for your concern, Inigo.

451
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,137
For my protection.

452
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,764
Protection against what?

453
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:56,724
Against who?

454
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:58,935
The real killer.

455
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,104
Don't take us for fools!

456
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:06,109
Mrs. George Palacios and I saw
the evidence in your room!

457
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,821
Those pieces of evidence
were just planted on me.

458
00:33:09,904 --> 00:33:13,533
Would I be stupid enough to put those
there where I could get caught?

459
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,540
You're also not convinced
that I'm the killer, right?

460
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:25,253
Because if you thought I was the killer,
you would have arrested me.

461
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,505
There would have been no need
for you to kidnap me.

462
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:31,759
The results of the fingerprint analysis
came out.

463
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,555
The evidence found in your room is clean.

464
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,557
We didn't find your fingerprints.

465
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,476
That's because it wasn't me.

466
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,312
Those pieces of evidence
were planted on me

467
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:45,356
to make it look like I was the suspect.

468
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:50,153
The killer is stupid
because when they planted those,

469
00:33:50,236 --> 00:33:51,571
they didn't have my fingerprints.

470
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:55,575
So you want the killer to be intelligent?

471
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:59,579
Do you want the killer
to have made you touch them

472
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:02,665
so that when we saw the fingerprints,
there'd have been no way out for you?

473
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:03,624
Is that it?

474
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,335
No.

475
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,087
Of course I don't.

476
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,048
But the killer is just stupid.

477
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,259
The killer is not stupid.
They've killed three people already.

478
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:17,430
They could have killed more
and we just don't know about them yet!

479
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:19,682
Ma'am.

480
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:21,476
Ma'am, what's with you?

481
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,810
- Loray, please.
- Ma'am.

482
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,814
- Ma'am! Ma'am! Ma'am!
- No, no, no, no, no!

483
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:30,902
Come here, ma'am.
Let's go back to your room, please.

484
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:32,487
- Ma'am.
- Please, let me go.

485
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:34,030
I need to find Jerico.

486
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:35,990
- But ma'am…
- Please, listen to me.

487
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,034
He's the only family who understands me.

488
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:41,162
- I'd rather be with him than you.
- Please. Please.

489
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:43,581
Rebecca, calm down.

490
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:46,000
Just follow Loray.

491
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,920
Jerico is a suspect. He's a dangerous man.

492
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,130
No, he's not. He's innocent.

493
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:53,424
Maybe he's more innocent than you.

494
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,884
Let go of me.

495
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:08,648
I see blood on your hands.

496
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,661
Who would want to plant
evidence against you?

497
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,250
Who has so much hatred for you that
they'd frame you for these cases?

498
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:28,876
I don't know.

499
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,255
Maybe Auntie Aurora.

500
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,465
She can't accept me.

501
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:38,177
If she dislikes you openly,
why say it openly?

502
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:43,558
She could keep it secret
and just frame you for Peter's murder.

503
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:49,147
And besides,
Peter died in a violent death.

504
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,982
He was hit by a baseball bat.

505
00:35:51,899 --> 00:35:57,780
And it seems like Mrs. Aurora wouldn't
be able to do that with her build.

506
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,743
Plus, Ms. Aurora has a shotgun.

507
00:36:02,827 --> 00:36:06,372
She always takes it out
when she wants to scare someone.

508
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:11,377
If that's the case, who is the killer?

509
00:36:11,961 --> 00:36:14,213
What blood? What are you talking about?

510
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:17,175
I had a vision that in the future…

511
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,511
there will be blood on your hands.

512
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:23,723
And you're so scared.

513
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:25,183
Panicking, even.

514
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,645
What happened? Whose blood?

515
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,189
I don't know.

516
00:36:32,565 --> 00:36:34,066
I can't be certain.

517
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:37,528
I-- I just see snippets of the future.

518
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,405
But there's one thing I can be sure of.

519
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,157
George.

520
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,202
George, my visions never lie.

521
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,081
That's what we're going to find out.

522
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:51,667
How?

523
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:53,669
With your help.

524
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,715
Sarge, he's a civilian.

525
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,053
Okay.

526
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:03,179
I agree.

527
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:05,890
Let's look for the real killer.

528
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,727
I don't want to lose my family.

529
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,313
The family I've been looking for
for a long time.

530
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:22,281
Sarge…

531
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,784
forgive me for saying this,

532
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,203
but what you're doing is absurd.

533
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,788
I'll get in trouble for this.

534
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:31,832
You kidnaped him,
and now you'll make him an asset?

535
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:37,630
We need a spy inside the Palacios' Estate
to learn the secrets of the people there.

536
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,258
But why Jerico?

537
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:45,429
How can we be sure we can trust him?

538
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,849
Because I see my old friend in him.

539
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:55,064
His dream was also to be with his family
whom he didn't know.

540
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,275
Which friend?

541
00:37:57,358 --> 00:38:02,697
I think it was wrong that I accepted
Father's offer to help my siblings.

542
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:05,950
They've become worse.

543
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:10,496
There's no hope, Napoy.
They are cruel, just like Sir Gustavo.

544
00:38:10,579 --> 00:38:12,039
They are monsters too.

545
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:15,584
That's why it was not my ambition
to be known as a Royales.

546
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:18,754
Because I don't want to be
like this family.

547
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,339
As for me,

548
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,591
I think there's still hope.

549
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:30,975
If you really want your family
to be whole, Sir Napoy,

550
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:34,854
you should help your siblings to forgive.

551
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:42,361
An old acquaintance from an old case
who became a friend too.

552
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,955
Hello, this is Villa.

553
00:38:54,707 --> 00:38:55,708
What?

554
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,837
What is it?

555
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,965
There's trouble again at
the Palacios' Estate.

556
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:10,389
I'm excited to see my wife
and our future baby.

557
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:14,977
I don't want to be
a prisoner here forever!

558
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,396
Why are you so insensitive to George?

559
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,982
Telling the truth
is not being insensitive.

560
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:24,195
<i>Ever since Basil died,</i>
<i>I've lost my sense of purpose.</i>

561
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,822
<i>I am not someone's wife anymore.</i>

562
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:29,408
<i>I'm just a sad, lonely widow.</i>

563
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,118
Aurora?

564
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:34,413
NEXT EPISODE

565
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,627
<i>We've found a common link</i>
<i>between all the targets.</i>

566
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:43,047
<i>All of them fought with one person.</i>

567
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,049
Who is the common link between them?

568
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:46,425
You, Mrs. Palacios.

569
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,054
There.

570
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:51,639
Aurora?

571
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:56,852
Why the hell are you rearranging
my shelves, Vivian?
