1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,016
Whose car is this?
Why is it blocking the driveway?

2
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,935
You? You're the one who is helping us?

3
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:21,187
You treat me and Mother so badly.

4
00:00:21,271 --> 00:00:24,190
That's just my front
so Aurora won't suspect.

5
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:26,651
She is the reason why my husband died.

6
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,445
The last clue, how sure are you

7
00:00:28,528 --> 00:00:29,946
that they have a child?

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,949
<i>‪You have to look</i>
<i>‪for a certain birth certificate.</i>

9
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,577
I have Rebecca's birth certificate.

10
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,370
Her declared father is Dad.

11
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:38,788
Rebecca is my sister.

12
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:41,958
‪I think you earned your rest.

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,377
‪Until our next activity.

14
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,087
PREVIOUSLY

15
00:00:47,046 --> 00:00:47,881
‪Mother!

16
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,717
‪I came to talk to you.

17
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,261
Sam, I want to patch things up with you.

18
00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:55,096
George, forgive me.

19
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,765
I forgive you now.

20
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:57,932
<i>Ward and I are just the same.</i>

21
00:00:58,016 --> 00:01:00,310
Remember, Ward was framed too.

22
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,937
‪But we need to tell Sergeant Royales
‪about the gas mask.

23
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,981
We need to dispose of the gas mask.

24
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,274
How are we going to do that?

25
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:08,568
Let's put this in Aurora's things.

26
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,320
- What?
- If you don't want to, then don't!

27
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,082
Sorry if I startled you earlier.

28
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,711
I was planning to approach you but…

29
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:29,380
it seems you have a new challenge,

30
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,008
so I don't want to meddle.

31
00:01:32,091 --> 00:01:34,219
But since you caught me,

32
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:37,847
the thing I heard about Rebecca…

33
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:38,765
‪is it true?

34
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:51,986
So, Rebecca is indeed your sister?

35
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,323
She's the daughter
of Auntie Aurora and Uncle Orly.

36
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,202
What did you say, Ma'am George?

37
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,124
Rebecca is the daughter of Auntie Aurora?

38
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:16,594
Vivian…

39
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,638
‪Tell me the truth.

40
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:22,642
Are you behind all the killings here?

41
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:25,812
‪Did you poison Basil?

42
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:28,148
‪No. No.

43
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,569
No, no.

44
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:35,738
- Get your bearings together!
- No.

45
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,199
Jericho…

46
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:42,537
I was also shocked.

47
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,583
But here.

48
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:51,212
Rebecca's last name is Castillo.

49
00:02:51,838 --> 00:02:53,423
She is my father's daughter.

50
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:58,303
I am her sister, not you.

51
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,310
But didn't you and Rebecca
have a DNA test before?

52
00:03:05,393 --> 00:03:07,312
And the results showed
that you are siblings?

53
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:09,272
How did that happen?

54
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:12,984
I don't know.

55
00:03:13,484 --> 00:03:16,946
What I know is
I am the son of Rodolfo Palacios.

56
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:22,660
No, Galvan. No.

57
00:03:23,578 --> 00:03:25,663
I am innocent, Galvan.

58
00:03:25,747 --> 00:03:27,332
Believe me.

59
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,584
It was just a set up.

60
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,628
That gas mask doesn't belong to me.

61
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,379
- No.
- Dad.

62
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,758
Mom is not the Palacios Killer
or the mastermind.

63
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,509
‪Someone just framed her.

64
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,719
‪Framed her?

65
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:41,095
‪And you believe her?

66
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,265
That excuse is so worn out.

67
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,393
All this woman does

68
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:48,811
is make trouble.

69
00:03:48,895 --> 00:03:52,315
And now, she will connive with you…

70
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,068
to plant the evidence on Aurora.

71
00:03:57,445 --> 00:04:00,698
I admit. I made a mistake
because I panicked.

72
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,200
But please…

73
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,077
I'm innocent.

74
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,662
It was just a setup.

75
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,830
Please, Galvan. Believe me.

76
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:08,790
I was just framed.

77
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,250
‪Stop lying.

78
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,128
‪Please.

79
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:32,272
Most likely Ma'am Aurora is behind this.

80
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:36,276
Maybe she has known for a long time

81
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,528
that you are the son of Uncle Rodolfo.

82
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:41,906
And to hide her secret and Dad's,

83
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,326
she made it look like
Rebecca is your sister.

84
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,249
That woman is an animal.

85
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:53,543
She has a lot of secrets.

86
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,336
She's hiding a lot of things.

87
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,547
Sam…

88
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:00,091
Will you go to Auntie Aurora?

89
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:02,427
‪Take it easy.

90
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,512
Something might happen to your baby.

91
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,180
I don't want
something bad to happen to him.

92
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,558
He should be healthy
until you give birth to him.

93
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,101
I'm taking care of my baby, George.

94
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,436
It's okay.

95
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:12,687
I'll go with you.

96
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:14,147
No, let me.

97
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,065
I'll go with her.

98
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:30,788
Galvan, please believe me.

99
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,707
I am innocent.

100
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:35,626
I was framed just like Ward.

101
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,086
That gas mask is not mine.

102
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,422
That was just placed in my things.

103
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,716
‪Please, Galvan. Please believe me.

104
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:44,010
I am not lying. Please!

105
00:05:44,093 --> 00:05:47,138
Sofia, did you touch that mask?

106
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:49,432
‪No, Dad. Just the box.

107
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:50,933
‪Good.

108
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:54,270
I'll have that investigated
by Sergeant Royales.

109
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,191
So we can find out who is framing Vivian.

110
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,529
So we'll find out
who that mastermind is, once and for all.

111
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:06,032
That is if…

112
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,744
your mommy is telling the truth.

113
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,666
Sofia, keep an eye on your mommy.

114
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,669
Don't you ever touch this.

115
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:38,981
Why did you bring that?

116
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,233
Where is Amando?

117
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,860
He is still talking
to the newly hired staff.

118
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:46,239
Mom Aurora.

119
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,075
Mom Aurora.

120
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,786
‪What the hell, Samantha?

121
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:53,454
What is your problem again?

122
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,665
Answer my question,

123
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,085
is Rebecca your daughter with Dad?

124
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,338
Is Rebecca my sister?

125
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:10,346
Mommy, I'm sure you can prove
that you're innocent.

126
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:15,226
Sofia, I'm scared.

127
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:20,314
Sergeant Royales might not believe me.

128
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:23,443
I'm scared, Sofia.

129
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,611
- Mom, just tell them the truth.
- I'm scared.

130
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,406
That's all you have to do.

131
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:48,968
No.

132
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,762
What are you talking about, Samantha?

133
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,183
I saw Rebecca's birth certificate.

134
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,979
You gave birth to her in France

135
00:08:00,062 --> 00:08:01,147
and Dad is her father.

136
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,857
Is this true?

137
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,817
Is she my sister?

138
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,909
Where did you get this?

139
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:15,870
From your basement.

140
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:17,955
You gave birth in France

141
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,917
and Castillo is her last name.

142
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:24,795
Just like my Dad's last name.

143
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:31,344
And the DNA results
of Jericho and Rebecca,

144
00:08:32,553 --> 00:08:34,430
how did it show that they are siblings?

145
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,224
Are you behind that too?

146
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:39,227
I have no idea what you're talking about.

147
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:42,271
Really, Samantha?

148
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:47,652
You would go this low to fabricate

149
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:50,488
these cheap things?

150
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,657
‪And I don't even remember

151
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,409
that I'm hiding this kind of document

152
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:57,119
in my basement.

153
00:08:58,037 --> 00:09:01,123
And one more thing, you have no right

154
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:04,210
to rummage through my house.

155
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,088
I have a right to know the truth!

156
00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:09,924
I have nothing to admit to you, Samantha.

157
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,011
You were gone for a year.

158
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,513
You went to Europe.

159
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:18,307
The same year that Rebecca was born.

160
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,102
How did you know that?

161
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:27,275
Whoever that freaking person is
who told you that,

162
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,734
she just made that up.

163
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:32,405
And I'm certain, this document is a fake.

164
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:35,992
And this was just planted
for you to easily find it.

165
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:39,453
‪I guess there's only one way to find out.

166
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,874
I will call the French Embassy.

167
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,334
I'll verify it.

168
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:46,252
‪No.

169
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:47,795
‪No!

170
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,713
‪No.

171
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,801
Samantha, you have no right
to dig up anything

172
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:55,595
about Rebecca's life.

173
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,346
I won't allow it.

174
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:00,099
‪Over my dead body.

175
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,560
Animal. Animal.

176
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:03,728
‪Now, get out.

177
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:05,896
Rico, take them out.

178
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:08,149
Animal. You're such an animal.

179
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:09,191
- I won't stop
- Leave.

180
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:10,776
until I find out the truth.

181
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:11,944
Jericho, get out.

182
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:14,697
You're a liar! You're a liar.

183
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,490
There's another way

184
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,908
to find out if we're sisters.

185
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:20,161
We'll have our DNA tested.

186
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:40,139
You're an animal, Samantha.

187
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,270
You will not stop searching
for something against me.

188
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,655
‪Hello.

189
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,908
About the thing
I called you about a while ago.

190
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:04,330
Sam…

191
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:07,333
Think carefully about your plan.

192
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:10,127
‪Given Rebecca's condition,
‪I don't think it's a good idea

193
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:13,464
that you just go to her
and tell her that you are siblings.

194
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:15,007
Why don't you consult
a psychiatrist first?

195
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,301
Ask if that's the right thing to do.

196
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,763
I won't go to the facility

197
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:22,681
to tell her about what I found out.

198
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:26,143
There you go again
with your issues with Auntie Aurora.

199
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,148
How about my godchild?
Are you focusing on him too?

200
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:33,692
Have you seen your OB yet?

201
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,487
Not yet,

202
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,073
but I have an appointment with her.

203
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,158
‪Sam,

204
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,994
‪you should prioritize your baby.

205
00:11:45,704 --> 00:11:46,789
‪I have a proposal.

206
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,583
My OB is close by.

207
00:11:49,667 --> 00:11:51,836
‪She's available for me anytime.

208
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,173
Do you want to transfer to a new OB?

209
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:58,134
I can introduce you to her.

210
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,010
I'll accompany you to all your checkups.

211
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,179
You would do that?

212
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:03,472
‪Of course.

213
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,808
‪Since, you know…

214
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,061
I don't have a baby anymore.

215
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:11,897
‪I'd love to help you.

216
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:16,110
I want to be a part
of your journey into becoming a mom.

217
00:12:16,861 --> 00:12:18,612
‪That is, if you allow me to.

218
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,573
‪Of course.

219
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,450
‪Of course, I would love that.

220
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,830
George, you will also be
the mother of my child.

221
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:30,541
Didn't I tell you
you're not only a godmother,

222
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,127
but you're also his second mom.

223
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,473
‪Good.

224
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,767
‪Make sure to report to me everything.

225
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,896
I want to know everything, every detail.

226
00:12:57,776 --> 00:13:00,738
You will not win against me, Samantha.

227
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:01,655
‪Never.

228
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,074
I will eventually find out

229
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,869
who is helping you…

230
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,424
So, is it okay, Sis?

231
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,844
I'll set up an appointment
with Dr. Flores within the week.

232
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,305
Thank you, George.

233
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:28,933
Ma'am Sam. Ma'am Sam.

234
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,312
I called the Saint Ignatius
Mental Facility.

235
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,774
It's Rebecca. She's missing. She escaped.

236
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:37,775
What?

237
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,739
It looks like Mom Aurora let her escape,

238
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,950
so I wouldn't push through
with the DNA testing.

239
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:53,749
Where is Rebecca?

240
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,171
Why are you asking me?

241
00:13:59,255 --> 00:14:01,799
‪She's in a mental facility, you idiot.

242
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,594
‪And you're not allowed
‪to go there, Samantha.

243
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:07,429
Rebecca is missing.

244
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:09,223
She escaped from the mental facility.

245
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,017
‪What?

246
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,769
‪Stop acting.

247
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,271
I know you're behind this

248
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:17,231
because you want to hide your secret.

249
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:18,857
‪No.

250
00:14:19,567 --> 00:14:21,235
Rebecca can't be lost.

251
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,695
Stop pretending.

252
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:23,696
Tell us where Rebecca is.

253
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:25,531
I know you know where Rebecca is.

254
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,579
Dr. De Los Reyes, is it true
that Rebecca is missing?

255
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,165
What?

256
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:36,667
‪God. So it's true?

257
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,168
‪Why didn't you tell me?

258
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,048
‪Damn you, Susanne.

259
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:46,886
I'm paying you a huge amount
to take care of Rebecca.

260
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,971
If something bad happens to her,

261
00:14:49,054 --> 00:14:50,139
‪I will sue you.

262
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,267
I will have
your mental facility shut down.

263
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:56,979
‪How did you know about this, huh?

264
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:57,897
‪How?

265
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,565
I am a soldier.

266
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,108
I have my ways.

267
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:05,738
General Alejaga…

268
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,949
Rebecca escaped from the mental facility.

269
00:15:09,033 --> 00:15:10,159
‪Find her.

270
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:12,453
‪I don't care how much it costs.

271
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,913
‪Just please…

272
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,457
‪Please, please.

273
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,833
‪Bring back my Rebecca.

274
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,293
‪I can't lose her.

275
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:20,961
She's the only one I have.

276
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,838
General Alejaga, please.

277
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:31,931
God, no…

278
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,405
The first time your mom

279
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:51,909
saw the gas mask inside the box,
you were there already?

280
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:53,702
Yes, she was there.

281
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:56,705
I was trying on clothes
to wear for the me…

282
00:15:56,789 --> 00:16:00,334
For the mass… the Sunday mass.

283
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:04,713
I wanted to match it with a bag

284
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:09,051
that's why I asked
for Sofia's help to get my box.

285
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,680
What was your Mommy's reaction, Sofia?

286
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:15,683
Well…

287
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,477
she was speechless.

288
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:21,021
Sofia…

289
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:25,484
It's not in your Mom's personality
to just be quiet.

290
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,486
When we searched your Dad's room,

291
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:28,904
she was so noisy.

292
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,364
- Check the cabinet.
- This is not allowed.

293
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,907
Wait, call the lawyer.

294
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,701
Call the attorney.

295
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,703
Sergeant Royales, this is not allowed.

296
00:16:35,786 --> 00:16:37,121
This is not allowed.

297
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:40,541
Galvan said you can't go into his room.

298
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:42,459
I will make this viral.
I will take your videos

299
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:44,920
and post them
on social media. So you'll go viral.

300
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,921
This is not allowed.

301
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,339
- Stop that.
- Ma'am Vivian.

302
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:50,134
‪The court has granted us
‪the search warrant.

303
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,428
We have a right.

304
00:16:52,511 --> 00:16:54,221
You read it right?

305
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:56,223
Could it be that you're changing the truth

306
00:16:56,306 --> 00:16:59,143
to fit with your mommy's narrative

307
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:01,395
that there's someone else
who put that in her things?

308
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,981
Wait a second.

309
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:07,609
It seems your line
of questioning is unfair.

310
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,655
You're putting things in
my daughter's mind

311
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:13,323
that you want her to think

312
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,950
so that's what she'll say,

313
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,535
so I will be pinned down.

314
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,203
That's what you're doing.

315
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,041
Sarge, accompany Ms. Trano outside

316
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,584
so I can interview Sofia.

317
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:24,626
- Go.
- No.

318
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:27,713
You can't talk to my daughter alone.

319
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:29,548
My husband will get mad.

320
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:30,674
That's not allowed.

321
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:32,134
Galvan!

322
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,137
Galvan, come here.

323
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,306
The investigators are harassing us.

324
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,025
George…

325
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:49,902
I've been looking
for you for some time now.

326
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:51,779
Did you know

327
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,531
that Sergeant Royales
is talking to Vivian?

328
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,909
They found a gas mask with her

329
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,536
that's why she's screaming
that she's been framed.

330
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,371
Really?

331
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:07,294
Is that you're only reaction, George?

332
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:10,756
I don't know, Mom.

333
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,634
It's because that gas mask

334
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,719
appears to be on someone.

335
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,638
Maybe it's true…

336
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,473
that someone just planted it on Vivian,

337
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,891
just like what happened to Ward.

338
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,685
With Ward, it was really planted.

339
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:26,021
But with Vivian, oh my, George.

340
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,358
Wait a second.

341
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:32,194
Why does it seem
like you're not even curious?

342
00:18:33,529 --> 00:18:37,366
I am focusing on something
more important now.

343
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,953
On how I can get my baby from Sam.

344
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,876
Galvan, we're being harassed here.

345
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,630
It's Daddy who asked
Sergeant Royales to come here

346
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,714
‪to investigate.

347
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,092
So he will not help you.

348
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:56,468
‪So please, stop shouting.

349
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,095
What do you mean stop?
When they are disrespecting us here?

350
00:18:58,178 --> 00:18:59,054
Vivian!

351
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,516
What's your problem this time?

352
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:05,102
They want me to step out of the room.

353
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,979
Your voice is so annoying.

354
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:07,896
It's so sharp.

355
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,439
If you shout

356
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,234
and won't stop,

357
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,194
please do it on a lower pitch,

358
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,696
so it doesn't hurt our ears.

359
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:17,322
Galvan, it's your investigators.

360
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:18,699
They're asking me to step out.

361
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:20,534
‪I said on a lower pitch.

362
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:21,618
‪Okay.

363
00:19:21,702 --> 00:19:23,495
Galvan, the investigators

364
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,330
want to talk to Sofia

365
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,915
without adult supervision.

366
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,333
That's not allowed.

367
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:32,004
Sir, we won't be able

368
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,672
to interview Sofia properly

369
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,965
with Ms. Trano around.

370
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,967
What you want is not allowed.

371
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,552
‪For goodness sake, Vivian.

372
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,430
‪Sofia is 18 years old.

373
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,932
‪She can speak on her own.

374
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:46,059
‪There is just an interview.

375
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,561
‪We need to know the truth.

376
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,563
So you'll be acquitted, right?

377
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,693
You're not hiding anything, right?

378
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,739
So there's no reason for you
to think of anything.

379
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:04,536
George, how's the…

380
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:08,040
doctor that you recommended to Sam?

381
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:09,666
That's okay, Mom.

382
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:11,376
I was able to convince Sam easily

383
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,462
to transfer to Dr. Flores.

384
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,215
So there's no more problem, George.

385
00:20:17,507 --> 00:20:18,926
But I don't know

386
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:21,303
how to convince Sam to have an ultrasound

387
00:20:21,386 --> 00:20:23,680
with all her issues right now.

388
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,682
I need proof

389
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,101
if the baby is a girl or a boy.

390
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,605
George, whatever goes to us,

391
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,690
I'll accept that.

392
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:37,861
Mother, I already spoke
to my friend from the census.

393
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,655
Until we know the baby's gender,

394
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,865
she can't make a birth certificate.

395
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,702
I need that as proof
that I am the baby's mother.

396
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:52,376
Sofia, we will just talk.

397
00:20:52,459 --> 00:20:53,669
‪Unless you're hiding something,

398
00:20:53,752 --> 00:20:55,337
there's nothing for you to be scared of.

399
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,549
Sofia, you're not hiding anything, right?

400
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,302
‪Or do you want me to call my lawyer…

401
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,388
so you'll be comfortable?

402
00:21:04,471 --> 00:21:05,764
‪You can speak to him first.

403
00:21:06,348 --> 00:21:07,641
That's it, Galvan.

404
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:09,768
A lawyer. That's what we need.

405
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,187
Right, Sofia? We need a lawyer.

406
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,981
Galvan, come on…

407
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,942
- Come on.
- No need.

408
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,571
I will just say the same thing
to Sergeant Royales and to the lawyer.

409
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,783
How about you, Vivian?

410
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,494
Are you hiding something?

411
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:37,212
Galvan, what am I hide?
I'm not doing anything.

412
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,214
I have nothing to do with this.

413
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,009
Even if you twist the questions
you want to ask us,

414
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,845
Even if you change your questions,

415
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:48,348
my daughter and I will
still give you the same answers.

416
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,350
Because we're not lying

417
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:52,144
and we're not hiding anything.

418
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,981
The gas mask was just planted on me,

419
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,942
That gas mask is not mine.
We just saw it inside the box

420
00:21:59,026 --> 00:22:00,569
and that's the truth.

421
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,362
Right, Sofia?

422
00:22:03,113 --> 00:22:04,197
‪Huh?

423
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,700
Yes.

424
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:08,535
‪It's settled then.

425
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,163
‪Let's go, Vivian.

426
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:14,583
‪Let's go.

427
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,338
Sarge, kindly follow up on the forensics.

428
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,423
Ask them if they have secured the car

429
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:22,799
we're looking for in the rent-a-car.

430
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,384
- Okay.
- Okay.

431
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,443
You're really excited
to be a mother, George.

432
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,447
You're expediting everything,
even the birth certificate.

433
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,326
That's not the only thing
I'm busy with Mom.

434
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,578
I'm also preparing the legal documents

435
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:53,830
and the passport.

436
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:56,249
Why?

437
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:58,752
Because as soon as the baby is born,

438
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,963
We will fly him out of the country.

439
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,943
Sergeant Tupaz, you're here.

440
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,570
Is Sergeant Royales with you?

441
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:27,197
I've been calling him for some time now.

442
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,616
Yes, he's in Mr. Polacios' house.

443
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:31,952
He's interviewing Sofia.

444
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,913
We also found a gas mask with Ms. Vivian.

445
00:23:34,996 --> 00:23:37,290
We're investigating it right now.

446
00:23:37,374 --> 00:23:38,667
Ms. Vivian?

447
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,170
Did she run Francis over?

448
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,966
It looks like Ms. Vivian is panicking

449
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,717
about what's happening.

450
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,971
If a piece of evidence
was planted in your things,

451
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,389
you might pee in your pants too
because of fear.

452
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:55,100
But was she just framed,

453
00:23:55,183 --> 00:23:56,434
or is she the mastermind?

454
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,312
If her daughter is the remaining Palacios,

455
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:02,107
she can act like a queen here.

456
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,358
Stupid.

457
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:06,236
As long as Ms. George
and Ms. Sam are alive,

458
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,404
that will never happen.

459
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,823
There's still Ma'am Aurora

460
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,533
and Sir Galvan.

461
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,619
Of course, she will kill all of them.

462
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:17,330
They first killed Sir Basil

463
00:24:17,414 --> 00:24:19,416
and then Ma'am Bev's baby.

464
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:20,542
What's next?

465
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:23,420
Ma'am Vivian is not like that.

466
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:25,797
She's just a nagger,

467
00:24:25,881 --> 00:24:27,924
but when it comes to killing,

468
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,384
I don't think so.

469
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,219
Let's make a bet.

470
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:40,645
Ms. Samantha, we are still
investigating Ms. Vivian.

471
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:42,981
She claims someone planted the gas mask.

472
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,650
She may be a victim of a frame-up

473
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,402
like Edward Balay.

474
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:53,074
She better make sure
that she didn't kill my brother.

475
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,411
Wait… Why are you looking
for Sergeant Royales?

476
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,749
I want to ask for his help.

477
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:03,668
Rebecca escaped from the mental facility.

478
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,880
Okay, I'll update Sergeant Royales,

479
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,215
so he can call you.

480
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:10,300
Thank you.

481
00:25:10,967 --> 00:25:11,885
Sam…

482
00:25:13,053 --> 00:25:15,138
Is what the staff is saying true?

483
00:25:15,222 --> 00:25:17,933
That Rebecca is your Dad's daughter?

484
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,603
Answer me.

485
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,067
How about you? Why are you quiet there?

486
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:29,402
You talk too much about Ma'am Vivian,

487
00:25:29,486 --> 00:25:31,238
I can't butt in.

488
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:32,989
What I heard is juicier.

489
00:25:36,284 --> 00:25:37,410
Here it goes.

490
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:41,915
Ma'am Rebecca escaped from the mental.

491
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,168
Yes, that's true.

492
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:46,670
And not only that,

493
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,756
I have a bigger revelation.

494
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,007
Are you ready?

495
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:55,845
Rebecca is Ma'am Aurora's daughter.

496
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:57,847
What?

497
00:25:57,931 --> 00:25:59,391
I'm not joking.

498
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:01,977
What did you say?

499
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,071
I said answer me.

500
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,949
What? Will you cover up for your father?

501
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:19,452
Mother, no.

502
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,582
But I want to make sure

503
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,585
that the birth certificate is legitimate.

504
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,754
Your father is so evil.

505
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:33,675
He got his mistress pregnant.

506
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:35,468
They are evil.

507
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:39,347
He and Ma'am Aurora are both evil.

508
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:49,107
Whose itchy tongue told you that?

509
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:52,277
Answer me.

510
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:54,988
Sir…

511
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,948
It was Ma'am Sam and Jericho.

512
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,743
They confronted Ma'am Aurora

513
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,996
because they saw

514
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,248
Ma'am Rebecca's birth certificate,

515
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,709
who was born in France.

516
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:21,973
‪Thank you, Sofia.

517
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,433
You can go out now.

518
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:25,852
Ms. Trano…

519
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,781
How did you first see
the gas mask that you claimed

520
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:41,034
was left in your things
by the Palacios killer?

521
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,288
Just like I told you earlier,

522
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,250
I was trying on clothes…

523
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:51,461
for the Sunday mass.

524
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,255
And then I wanted to match it with a bag.

525
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,674
That's why I asked Sofia

526
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:58,385
to get the box.

527
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,137
When I opened it…

528
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,724
the gas mask was there already.

529
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:10,230
What happened after?

530
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:13,566
Sofia wanted…

531
00:28:16,444 --> 00:28:19,114
to throw the gas mask away

532
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,868
because she got scared for me

533
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,163
because I might be in danger.

534
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,417
But I told her that was wrong.

535
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:34,337
We should surrender the gas mask to you,

536
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,048
so you could investigate it.

537
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,426
And she agreed.

538
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:43,346
‪Mommy, no.

539
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:48,935
Sofia, Sergeant Royales

540
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,979
is done interviewing you.

541
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,939
You should leave.

542
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:54,816
‪Go.

543
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:56,860
‪Miss Sofia.

544
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:01,698
‪Please stay.

545
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,451
There's something
I want to clear up with you.

546
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,539
Ma'am Aurora wants to ask you

547
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:12,709
if you have found Rebecca,
General Alejaga.

548
00:29:16,212 --> 00:29:17,380
Thank you.

549
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,008
Thank you, General.

550
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:21,593
Aurora…

551
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,143
Is it true that Rebecca
is your daughter with Orly?

552
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:34,981
Please, Galvan.

553
00:29:35,064 --> 00:29:37,233
Rebecca is missing.

554
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,819
Can we focus on that first, rather than…

555
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,572
believe my daughter-in-law's fake news?

556
00:29:42,655 --> 00:29:44,115
Answer me first.

557
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:48,119
For six months you sent me to Peru

558
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:50,413
‪for a business venture.

559
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,749
‪Eight months after, you left for Europe.

560
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,752
When I got back,
Rebecca had already been born.

561
00:29:56,419 --> 00:29:57,921
You and Rodolfo said

562
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:00,298
he got a woman pregnant,

563
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:01,800
but she died while giving birth.

564
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:04,803
‪Was this all a lie?

565
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,179
Galvan.

566
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:09,224
Is it true that Rebecca
is your daughter with Orly…

567
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,437
that you and Rodolfo covered up?

568
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,275
Does this have anything
to do with Orly's death?

569
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:22,362
Did Paco find out?
That's why you killed Orly?

570
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:25,907
‪Galvan, stop.

571
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:27,075
‪Please.

572
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,286
‪We need to find Rebecca.

573
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,038
Help me find Rebecca.

574
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:34,165
Is Rebecca your daughter?

575
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:36,835
- Galvan.
- Answer me!

576
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:39,462
Is Rebecca your daughter with Orly?

577
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:40,797
Yes!

578
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:46,010
Orly and I have a daughter,
and it's Rebecca.

579
00:30:59,482 --> 00:31:01,734
That was Rodolfo's idea.

580
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:03,903
He doesn't want a scandal.

581
00:31:05,196 --> 00:31:07,282
That's why when I gave birth in France,

582
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:09,075
he asked Orly to follow.

583
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:14,163
We needed to make
a birth certificate for Rebecca,

584
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:19,294
so we could get her
a passport back to the Philippines.

585
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:24,173
When we got back here, that's when Rodolfo

586
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,259
made a Philippine birth certificate

587
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,095
‪claiming Rebecca as his daughter.

588
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:31,097
That's why I'm so mad at Jericho.

589
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:34,142
Because he claims
that Rebecca is his sister.

590
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,894
But I kept quiet, Galvan.

591
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,523
Because I didn't want anyone
to know the truth.

592
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:45,904
Ma'am Aurora…

593
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,531
Who iare Rebecca's real parents?

594
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,498
Rebecca and I are not siblings.

595
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,501
This DNA test result,

596
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,962
I meddled with it.

597
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:05,965
I made it look like
Rebecca and I were siblings

598
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:07,842
because I have grown to love her
and I don't want her to get hurt.

599
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,429
‪Then prepare to go to jail, Jericho.

600
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,431
‪For pretending to be a Palacios.

601
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,642
I indeed have Palacios blood.

602
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:18,227
That's what came out
in the DNA Test results.

603
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,731
And it will show the same result
if we both take the DNA test.

604
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:30,907
But it that test also showed

605
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,951
that it's impossible
for Rebecca and I to be siblings.

606
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:37,038
And that could only happen
if her parents are different.

607
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,166
The question is, who?

608
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,336
It's impossible that it's Sir Galvan

609
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,673
because it's not in his character
to hide his illegitimate child.

610
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,967
There's Sofia and she's with us.

611
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,970
Ma'am Aurora…

612
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:55,223
Are you Rebecca's real parent?

613
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,729
I have no obligation

614
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:05,316
to answer any of your questions.

615
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,860
You said you love Rebecca

616
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,655
and you don't want her to get hurt

617
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:13,574
‪So, stop asking questions.

618
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,578
Or else, even if you're Rodolfo's son,

619
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:19,872
‪I will make sure

620
00:33:19,956 --> 00:33:22,458
that you will never go near Rebecca,

621
00:33:22,542 --> 00:33:25,503
or any member of my family.

622
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:29,215
Didn't you say…

623
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,093
you're only after your family?

624
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:34,470
‪Well…

625
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,432
‪Welcome to the family, then.

626
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,809
‪Bastard of the Palacios.

627
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,526
Now that you know everything, Galvan…

628
00:33:50,403 --> 00:33:51,237
‪Please.

629
00:33:52,363 --> 00:33:53,197
‪Please.

630
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,200
Please, Galvan. Help me.

631
00:33:56,951 --> 00:33:59,370
‪Help me find Rebecca.

632
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:02,540
Just like I said earlier,

633
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,585
my daughter and I agreed

634
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:09,338
to surrender the gas mask to you,

635
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:11,257
so you could have it investigated.

636
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,886
If you have an agreement
like that with your Mom,

637
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:17,764
why were you arguing
when Sir Galvan caught you?

638
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,850
TBecause…

639
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:22,852
Sofia changed her mind.

640
00:34:24,103 --> 00:34:25,480
Right, Sofia?

641
00:34:26,272 --> 00:34:28,441
My daughter got scared for me because…

642
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,403
She thought that I might be in danger.

643
00:34:34,322 --> 00:34:35,490
That's why…

644
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,534
She wanted to throw the gas mask away.

645
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,912
But I said no.

646
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,998
We shouldn't do that.

647
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:46,793
We should just surrender it to you
because that's a piece of evidence.

648
00:34:46,876 --> 00:34:48,211
Is that true, Sofia?

649
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,379
Sofia, answer him.

650
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:52,799
Tell him that what I'm saying is true.

651
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,675
Sofia, what really happened?

652
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,053
Sofia please, tell them the truth.

653
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,263
‪-Please.
‪-Mommy, I'm so sorry.

654
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,808
‪I can't do this anymore.

655
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:05,394
Let's not change the story
and just admit the truth.

656
00:35:06,395 --> 00:35:07,688
Sofia…

657
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:10,733
What are you saying?

658
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,494
Galvan, please. Paco is dead.

659
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,246
I already lost a son,

660
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:27,166
I can't afford to lose Rebecca,

661
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:29,418
my daughter too, Galvan.

662
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:31,879
You're so evil.

663
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,632
‪You made us all believe

664
00:35:35,258 --> 00:35:37,468
that Rebecca was just our niece.

665
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:43,224
You fooled us all. Especially Rebecca.

666
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:00,867
Amando…

667
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,287
Amando, help me… Amando, help me…

668
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,122
Help me Amando.

669
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,669
‪I've pleaded several times

670
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,212
to have Rebecca

671
00:36:13,296 --> 00:36:15,089
if you couldn't take care of her.

672
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,341
But you didn't agree.

673
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,052
You even accused me of using her

674
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,305
to get her company shares.

675
00:36:22,805 --> 00:36:24,974
It turns out, it's you who used her.

676
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,142
You abused her!

677
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,855
You treated your daughter like a thing.

678
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:33,482
Now…

679
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,945
Don't you dare ask me for help
to find her.

680
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,199
‪She's better off on the streets

681
00:36:41,282 --> 00:36:43,284
than living with you.

682
00:36:54,086 --> 00:36:55,588
Amando.

683
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,007
‪How could you, Amando?

684
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,010
Why did you not protect me from Galvan?

685
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:10,853
Mercy…

686
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:13,522
What are you doing here?

687
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:15,524
You deserve to be spat on.

688
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,443
Mother.

689
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,488
Amando.

690
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:27,787
- Sofia.
- Ms. Trano.

691
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,622
Why are you changing everything
that happened?

692
00:37:29,705 --> 00:37:31,666
Everything I said was true.

693
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,086
Someone placed a gas mask in my things.

694
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,339
But we didn't see it together, Mommy.

695
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,467
Let's not lie anymore.

696
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:42,927
Just admit the truth.

697
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,096
I have nothing to admit

698
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:47,098
because I'm not lying.

699
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,016
- I am innocent.
- Miss Trano.

700
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:51,602
That gas mask is not mine.

701
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:53,229
I am not the Palacios killer

702
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:54,730
and I'm not the mastermind.

703
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:57,817
I have nothing to do with those killings.

704
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,859
Believe me.

705
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,903
Don't turn the tables on me, Sofia.

706
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,030
I am innocent.

707
00:38:04,156 --> 00:38:05,992
Sofia.

708
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,536
Sofia, don't talk anymore.

709
00:38:09,578 --> 00:38:12,373
Don't talk until we have a lawyer.

710
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,250
- Do you understand?
- Sofia…

711
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,546
‪You have a choice. It's your choice.

712
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,716
You can clarify the story now,

713
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:23,175
or we can wait for your lawyer.

714
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,760
‪No, Sofia. No.

715
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,930
Don't lie here.

716
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,016
I want to end this.

717
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:33,227
Sofia…

718
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:44,488
Mother, Mother, Mother, Mother…

719
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:45,906
That's enough.

720
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,825
Mother, that's enough. Let's go.

721
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,537
Mother.

722
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,502
‪What the hell is wrong with you, Amando?

723
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,381
Why didn't you protect me from Galvan?

724
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:07,094
And you let Mercy spit on me, huh?

725
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,602
Why do you look at me like that, Amando?

726
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:22,693
Amando!

727
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,237
Amando, come back here.

728
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,906
Amando!

729
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:32,161
‪Damn you, Amando. Damn you all!

730
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:49,387
You would really spit at
and hurt, Mom Aurora?

731
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,138
Yes, because she's disgusting.

732
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,390
Her and Orly are both disgusting.

733
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:53,808
She confessed.

734
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,061
Rebecca is her daughter with Orly.

735
00:39:58,229 --> 00:39:59,313
What?

736
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,023
She confessed?

737
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,237
So I don't need a DNA Test.

738
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,448
She's an animal.

739
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:13,244
If you hadn't arrived, I would've
spat on her and hurt that woman.

740
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:14,328
Then I would get even with her.

741
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,539
- I will come back for her.
- Mother.

742
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:17,665
Mother, stop it.

743
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,542
She might sue you.

744
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,001
Then go ahead and sue me.

745
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,795
I will face her in court.

746
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,135
Really, Mother?

747
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,011
You can face her in court?

748
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,722
Mother, that's easy to say,

749
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:37,518
but we both know
that she's hard to fight with.

750
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,856
Right, Mother? Let's not create
any more problems.

751
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,942
So I'm a problem for you now, Sam?

752
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,404
Mother, that's not what I meant.

753
00:40:48,487 --> 00:40:49,572
What I meant was,

754
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,532
let's not make any decisions

755
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:53,159
that we haven't though about

756
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:55,703
because I have
a lot of problems right now.

757
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,873
Like Rebecca escaping
from the mental hospital.

758
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,332
And Ms. Vivian…

759
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,710
There's a possibility
that she killed Francis.

760
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,628
It's possible that
she's the Palacios killer,

761
00:41:04,712 --> 00:41:06,338
and the mastermind of everything.

762
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:08,507
I don't know what to prioritize.

763
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,134
What?

764
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:12,303
Was it Vivian who ran Francis over?

765
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:14,597
And instead of you confronting her,

766
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,725
you're focusing on
your father's illegitimate daughter?

767
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,977
What kind of sister are you?

768
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:26,066
Sam, I'm on your side.

769
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,735
I'm not the enemy here.

770
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,777
‪NEXT EPISODE

771
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:29,695
What's happening?

772
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,197
Sam, the baby.

773
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,325
<i>My OB is available</i>
<i>for me anytime. Let's go.</i>

774
00:41:34,408 --> 00:41:35,701
I need to make sure that my baby--

775
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:39,330
My godchild is well and fine.

776
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:41,248
What is your issue?

777
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,625
It's about our son, Paco.

778
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,877
You never told him

779
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,087
that I was his real father.

780
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,590
You made my daughter lie for you?

781
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,300
You really are a worthless mother.

782
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:54,845
Sergeant Royales, do what
you have to do with this woman.

783
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,224
Arrest her, sue her. I don't care.

784
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:01,101
Just take her away from me
and my daughter.

785
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,770
I can now push through with my plan.

786
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,647
Plan?

787
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,649
What plan?

788
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:10,236
Dad, it's Mommy. She escaped.

789
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:13,405
‪Jericho, alert all security. Now!

790
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,657
<i>Yes.</i>

791
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:17,284
Where are you going?

792
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,953
You are still under investigation, right?

793
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:20,788
Go ahead and come closer.

794
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,164
Come closer.
