1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,350
<i>Stop your illusions</i>
<i>about marrying this woman.</i>

2
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:18,518
You don't like me?

3
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,978
Then I don't like you either.

4
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:23,189
<i>I will choose who I want to marry.</i>

5
00:00:23,273 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>Let's get married.</i>

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,152
<i>Paco said you just got back</i>
<i>from your honeymoon?</i>

7
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,362
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- I'd love to meet your wife.</i>

8
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,364
<i>You're Basil's wife?</i>

9
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,950
So you're <i>that </i>Sam Castillo.

10
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:34,784
Palacios.

11
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:36,953
Sam Castillo-Palacios.

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:37,954
She's my wife.

13
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:40,957
<i>Why did you choose a scandalous wife?</i>

14
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,000
You jerk!

15
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:44,210
<i>How dare you hurt my son?!</i>

16
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:48,965
Paco's life is more valuable
than you and your father combined!

17
00:00:49,048 --> 00:00:52,051
<i>If I tell you to apologize, apologize!</i>

18
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:54,637
<i>Don't you ever disrespect</i>
<i>your Auntie Aurora again!</i>

19
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,223
<i>This is why Auntie Aurora and Paco</i>
<i>look down on us!</i>

20
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:59,642
<i>You let your sister boss you around</i>
<i>even though you're the older brother.</i>

21
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,937
No wonder Grandfather chose Auntie Aurora
and not you to lead the company.

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,731
Because you don't have the balls to do it!

23
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,483
<i>Disrespectful!</i>

24
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:09,194
PREVIOUSLY

25
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:11,946
Don't you ever forget,
I'm still your father!

26
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:14,991
Yes, you're my father.

27
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,119
My weak, weak father!

28
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,498
Don't worry.

29
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,875
I'm not like you.

30
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:26,211
I can make our family rise.

31
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,963
I will take what's rightfully ours,

32
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,049
something you couldn't do for us.

33
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,926
You're so arrogant.

34
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,970
Maybe you've forgotten something.

35
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:40,099
If it weren't for
this weak father of yours,

36
00:01:40,183 --> 00:01:42,811
you would still be rotting in jail.

37
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:06,835
Where's my charger?

38
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,238
What are you looking at?

39
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,327
I was looking for my charger.

40
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,203
I thought I left it here.

41
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,330
Really?

42
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:29,125
That doesn't look like a charger to me.

43
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,171
Your pictures are beautiful.

44
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,965
You looked beautiful here
when you were still young.

45
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:40,553
Is this Paco's father?

46
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:41,846
Where is he?

47
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,098
He died.

48
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,059
A long time ago.

49
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,689
But you're still using
the Palacios family name?

50
00:03:53,191 --> 00:03:54,734
You didn't get married?

51
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,194
Why?

52
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,366
Why are you so interested
in my family, Sam?

53
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,203
Your family?

54
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:09,749
Sorry.

55
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:15,129
I thought when Paco and I got married,
I was now a part of this family.

56
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,848
Madam. Madam!

57
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,476
Madam, it is Rebecca.

58
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,978
Rebecca is missing.

59
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:38,486
Rebecca!

60
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:41,197
- Rebecca!
- Rebecca!

61
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:45,076
- Rebecca!
- Rebecca!

62
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,494
Rebecca!

63
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:48,413
- Becca!
- Rebecca!

64
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:50,456
Rebecca!

65
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,125
Rebecca!

66
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,920
Rebecca!

67
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,380
Rebecca!

68
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:59,590
You! All of you, come here!

69
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:04,220
If anything bad happens to Rebecca,
you'd better start praying!

70
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,055
You and your family!

71
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,265
Look for her!

72
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,516
- Yes, ma'am!
- Rebecca!

73
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,978
It's your fault!

74
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,731
Why did you neglect Rebecca?

75
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:18,109
Don't blame me!

76
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:20,361
I provided everything for her.

77
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:23,281
Well, if you did,
this wouldn't have happened!

78
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:26,451
If you can't take care of Rebecca,
just give her to me,

79
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,077
and I will take care of her.

80
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,956
I know what you're trying to do.

81
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:35,418
You want to get Rebecca
so you can get her shares.

82
00:05:35,501 --> 00:05:36,753
What for?

83
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,505
Because you want to be
a majority shareholder!

84
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,884
What? Is that really how you see me?

85
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,511
I love Rebecca.

86
00:05:45,595 --> 00:05:47,597
Then go find her!

87
00:05:49,307 --> 00:05:52,310
And remember this!

88
00:05:52,393 --> 00:05:54,937
You will never get Rebecca from me!

89
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,613
Rebecca!

90
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,822
Rebecca!

91
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,492
Rebecca!

92
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,161
- Rebecca!
- Rebecca!

93
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:11,412
Rebecca!

94
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,164
- Rebecca!
- Rebecca!

95
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,208
- Rebecca!
- Rebecca!

96
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,459
Rebecca!

97
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:21,255
- Let me go!
- Ma'am Rebecca, don't fight back anymore.

98
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,591
Let me go! What's wrong with you?
Enough!

99
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:27,428
- Obey us, please!
- I need to get married!

100
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,806
Don't fight us anymore.
You'll only get hurt.

101
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,557
Tonyo!

102
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,644
- Let's go, let's go!
- Stop it.

103
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:36,979
Let me go.

104
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,689
Ma'am Rebecca, don't fight back anymore.

105
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:40,858
No!

106
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,735
Rebecca. Rebecca?

107
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,154
Rebecca. Rebecca. Rebecca!

108
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:47,865
After her! Catch her!

109
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:50,785
- Rebecca!
- Go after her.

110
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:51,744
Rebecca!

111
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:52,912
Help me.

112
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,914
Help me find Tonyo.

113
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,582
We're getting married.

114
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,876
Help me. Help me, please.

115
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,794
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait!

116
00:06:59,877 --> 00:07:01,754
- Calm down.
- Get her.

117
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:04,799
- Bring her to her room!
- Hold on.

118
00:07:04,882 --> 00:07:06,926
- All right, ma'am.
- Bring her to her room!

119
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,595
- Okay, go ahead.
- We're getting married!

120
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,931
What happened to Rebecca?
Who is Tonyo?

121
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:15,601
That's none of your business.

122
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:21,107
Amando!

123
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:28,906
- No!
- Ma'am!

124
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:32,535
Ma'am, please.
Ma'am, calm down, ma'am!

125
00:07:32,618 --> 00:07:34,620
- Ma'am.
- No!

126
00:07:35,371 --> 00:07:36,289
No!

127
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:39,584
- No!
- Ma'am, please, ma'am.

128
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,501
- Please, ma'am.
- Tonyo!

129
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,295
- Ma'am, ma'am…
- Tonyo!

130
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,884
- Ma'am.
- Please don't.

131
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,720
Ma'am…

132
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,889
Ma'am, she's okay now.

133
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,559
Now leave!

134
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,386
I'm sorry, Rebecca.

135
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,224
We have to do this to you.

136
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:40,686
But this…

137
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,273
this is all for you.

138
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,738
This is all for you.

139
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,566
Don't touch that!

140
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,789
Sorry.

141
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:48,791
It's okay. Let me.

142
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:58,843
Is that human blood?

143
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,512
No, it's animal blood.

144
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,973
Ma'am Rebecca asked me to buy it.

145
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:05,891
You'll get used to it.

146
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,560
No one gets hurt.

147
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,732
Do you believe in stuff like this?

148
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:16,944
Can you really talk

149
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:19,780
to the dead?

150
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,785
I believe in heaven.

151
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:29,790
I believe we all go there when we die.

152
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,918
If we were good people.

153
00:12:33,836 --> 00:12:35,713
But what about bad people?

154
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,649
Who was that?

155
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:17,588
Hey.

156
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,965
Pretty.

157
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,091
Yes.

158
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:25,054
Why are you dressed like that?
You look like a beggar's son.

159
00:13:25,137 --> 00:13:28,474
Why don't you be more like your sister
so you can marry someone rich?

160
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,851
What is that? Go ahead and change.

161
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:32,645
You noticed me again.

162
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:42,238
George, I saw Sam gossiping
with one of the staff.

163
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:44,907
That Sam is so shameless.

164
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,075
What's her plan?

165
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,910
To penetrate the Palacios family

166
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,453
and even the servants

167
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,704
so they will take her side?

168
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,705
What else?

169
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,374
Like mother, like daughter.

170
00:13:53,457 --> 00:13:55,334
I became part of this family first.

171
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,128
This time, I won't allow us
to be left with nothing

172
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,713
because of that Sam.

173
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,082
What's happening?

174
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:37,585
Mother's called for a family meeting.

175
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,720
What is this meeting all about?

176
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:43,901
Only Rebecca is missing.

177
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:46,737
Let her rest first.

178
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,531
She's not involved in our business.

179
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,355
Now that everyone is back at the estate,

180
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,695
all of you may resume working
for the company.

181
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,113
Yes.

182
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:30,781
I'm so ready.

183
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:32,282
Good, Basil.

184
00:16:32,866 --> 00:16:37,871
But there will be changes
in your positions in the company.

185
00:16:37,955 --> 00:16:39,999
Of course, Paco here,

186
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,918
since he finished his MBA,

187
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:47,089
will replace Galvan as COO,

188
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:50,467
while Galvan
will be transferred to finance.

189
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:51,677
What?

190
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:53,971
Wait…

191
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,933
I will just be a consultant?

192
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:02,563
I'm OIC!

193
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,774
On the way to becoming a director!

194
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:08,485
Basil, you took a break,

195
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:11,447
so you need to reorient yourself again

196
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,284
about what's happened in the company
while you were away.

197
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,285
Bullshit!

198
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:19,788
This is unfair!

199
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,875
Are you getting back at me
because of my fight with Paco?

200
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,252
When I'm definitely more capable
than your son?

201
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:29,798
Hey, I have nothing to do with that.

202
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,467
That's Mom's decision.

203
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,177
Will you shut up?

204
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,721
- Mama's boy!
- Basil, calm down.

205
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:41,560
Auntie Aurora, Sam and I
will be your second assistants?

206
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,644
Yes.

207
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:46,190
But after three months,
one of you will be terminated.

208
00:17:49,526 --> 00:17:53,655
Because I want to see which of you

209
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,282
is better.

210
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,409
Wait, wait, hold on.

211
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,246
Aurora, can we talk about this first?

212
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,666
My decision is final.

213
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:06,835
- Your decision is nepotism!
- But Aurora…

214
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,090
It's nepotism! You only got your position
because you're the son of Auntie Aurora.

215
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,884
You don't deserve to be CEO. I do!

216
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,886
I'm the future of this company, not you!

217
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:19,473
- Is that so? You better watch your mouth!
- I won't watch my mouth, nepo baby!

218
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:23,727
Just because your son finished his MBA,
he can take my position?

219
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:24,978
Why not?

220
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:27,064
And Basil? Why did you demote him?

221
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:27,898
That's it!

222
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,985
- You want your son to replace you!
- That's what your decision is all about?!

223
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:34,655
- What's your problem?
- You're my problem, you punk!

224
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,574
- You think he's capable?
- What's with you?

225
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,450
Why now?

226
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:40,911
- What do you mean why now?
- Why without asking me?

227
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,539
Why do I need to ask you, Galvan?

228
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,833
- You've gone too far!
- Bring it on!

229
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,459
Do you really think you can
handle the position?

230
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:48,418
Shut up, Paco!

231
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:52,089
- You're not capable of being the CEO!
- See?

232
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,384
I don't have to do anything
to make you suffer.

233
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:57,803
Welcome to your own hell, Sam.

234
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:01,014
It's so fun to be a Palacios, right?

235
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:05,644
Why is it like that?

236
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:08,647
I'm the one managing here, remember?

237
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,567
Do you have the right to make decisions?

238
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,485
Or am I the only one
who can make decisions?

239
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:14,862
Yes, you're the only one,

240
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,530
but you should've asked me.

241
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,739
And why would I ask you?

242
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,283
- Let go of me.
- I'm the CEO!

243
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:21,451
- I run the estate.
- Sam? Sam? Are you okay?

244
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:25,914
- I'm the one running our company.
- Yes, but can you even manage it properly?

245
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,458
- Dad! Say something!
- Hon, are you okay?

246
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,878
Why don't you want to contradict her?
You're her older brother!

247
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,629
- Shut up!
- You're the-- You shut up, Paco!

248
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,089
You shut up, Basil!

249
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,511
Who was it?

250
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,431
Who pushed Sam?

251
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:58,447
Who?

252
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,284
No one wants to answer? Okay, fine!

253
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:04,995
How about now?

254
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:06,830
Answer me!

255
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,290
Who pushed Sam?!

256
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:19,927
Well?

257
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,429
Answer me!

258
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,944
- Who?
- Son!

259
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:38,820
Paco!

260
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,864
That's enough!

261
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:47,287
If Sam gets hurt one more time
because of all of you,

262
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:50,457
I will kill you all!

263
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,712
Did you hear me?

264
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,506
I will kill you!

265
00:21:11,728 --> 00:21:13,730
This is ridiculous!

266
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:25,075
Amando, have all this cleaned.

267
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,929
This is not right!

268
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,956
Amando, refill, please.

269
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,875
Thank you.

270
00:22:20,756 --> 00:22:22,507
"This is not right."

271
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,594
Come on, Galvan.

272
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,810
Did you see all that?

273
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,520
Have this cleaned up, Amando.

274
00:22:35,604 --> 00:22:37,606
- Yes, ma'am.
- Now!

275
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:41,151
Wow.

276
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:44,654
Paco was scary earlier.

277
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,823
Do you think he'd really kill someone?

278
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,951
His eyes were so angry.

279
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:52,788
He was just showing off to his wife.

280
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:55,290
I wasn't expecting that.

281
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,835
From what I knew of him,

282
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,506
I thought he was a chill type of person.

283
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,926
He teased you and joked around,

284
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,344
but

285
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:11,348
I didn't know that he had a violent side.

286
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:14,392
Because you don't know him very well.

287
00:23:15,185 --> 00:23:16,686
But me…

288
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:19,481
I knew that a long time ago.

289
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,401
Paco has a violent streak.

290
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:26,488
Okay, boys.

291
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,699
You want to join our fraternity, right?

292
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:31,660
Is that all you can do?

293
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:32,786
Ten, Master!

294
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:34,329
Ten?

295
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:37,082
I like it. Dedicated.

296
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:43,004
That's enough.

297
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,715
He wants to join our frat.

298
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:47,843
He needs to endure it.

299
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,886
Can you still take it?

300
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,222
- Yes, I can.
- There you go.

301
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,642
Paco!

302
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,520
Paco, that's enough!

303
00:24:00,188 --> 00:24:02,649
Paco is a sadist?

304
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,986
That's difficult to believe.

305
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:08,738
Trust me.

306
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,825
He's good at hiding it,

307
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:16,163
but behind those puppy eyes,

308
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,707
that boyish charm of his,

309
00:24:19,332 --> 00:24:20,792
trust me,

310
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,753
there's a beast inside of him.

311
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,904
Are you all right?

312
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,698
It's you I'm thinking about.

313
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,201
I'm worried about you.

314
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,287
About what you said to your family.

315
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:44,334
You've seen how dysfunctional
my family is, right?

316
00:25:45,252 --> 00:25:47,170
They're fighting over what?

317
00:25:48,213 --> 00:25:49,881
A company position?

318
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,550
And they will involve you too?

319
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,640
I don't want them to think that
they can bully you.

320
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,853
These people are monsters.

321
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,355
I grew up with them.

322
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:08,650
And the truth is,
I can't stand them anymore.

323
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,619
I'd rather build a family with you.

324
00:26:51,318 --> 00:26:52,485
Hi.

325
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:00,827
Oh, hi, hi, hello.

326
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:04,998
I am preparing pork kebab.

327
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,750
You should try this. It's good.

328
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,251
Oh sit, sit, sit.

329
00:27:10,712 --> 00:27:13,006
Oh, yeah, by the way, I forgot.

330
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,591
I'm Rebecca.

331
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,261
We've met already.

332
00:27:22,557 --> 00:27:23,725
When?

333
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,352
Yesterday.

334
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:34,611
Yesterday?

335
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:38,031
I can't remember.

336
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,450
Are you sure that it was me?

337
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:42,994
Maybe it was someone
who just looked like me.

338
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:48,625
Oh, by the way, do you like salmon?

339
00:27:49,793 --> 00:27:51,836
I cook delicious salmon.

340
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,924
You'll forget your own name
once you taste it.

341
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,844
Every Tuesday, I ask them to buy some.

342
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:01,846
Today is Thursday.

343
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,307
Are you sure? Thursday?

344
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,894
From what I remember, Monday…

345
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:12,399
Well anyway…

346
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:14,901
We can cook steak. We can have steak.

347
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:17,237
I'm good at grilling steak.

348
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,115
Okay, that's what I'll ask them to buy.

349
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:24,452
Do you want to try it?

350
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:26,413
It's cooked already. Here.

351
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:40,051
Maybe she's forgetful or she has amnesia,
and that's why Rebecca can't remember.

352
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:44,848
No. I don't think Rebecca is capable
of hurting someone.

353
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:49,102
How about your husband, Sam?

354
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:50,520
Is he hurting you?

355
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,689
No.

356
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,357
Where did that come from?

357
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,443
Are you drunk? Are you drinking?

358
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,361
Sam, I don't drink anymore.

359
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:01,030
I've also stopped smoking.

360
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,491
Promise?

361
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:09,748
All the money you're spending on me
will be wasted if I don't behave.

362
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:11,583
Really?

363
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:15,378
- Bring this upstairs.
- Let me, Sam.

364
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,880
Just remember, Sam.

365
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:20,633
If someone hurts you
or if your husband's family oppresses you,

366
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:22,260
just let me know.

367
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:23,303
I'll take care of you.

368
00:29:23,386 --> 00:29:25,221
Yes.

369
00:29:26,973 --> 00:29:28,725
I'll just take this upstairs.

370
00:29:35,899 --> 00:29:36,858
Francis?

371
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,943
Francis?

372
00:29:39,027 --> 00:29:40,361
Francis!

373
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,823
Francis! What's--

374
00:29:43,907 --> 00:29:44,949
Mother!

375
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:47,118
Francis!

376
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:48,787
Mother!

377
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,627
I came as soon as I could.
What happened?

378
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,798
It's okay. It's the effect of his chemo.

379
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:04,177
They've put him on an IV drip for now,
but he'll be discharged later.

380
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,096
But he has to rest in bed
for a week. Right?

381
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,557
Are you feeling any other pain?

382
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,895
Because if you want,
we can seek a second opinion.

383
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,980
I have doctor friends

384
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:18,024
and they're all good.

385
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:23,029
She just said that I'm okay.

386
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,823
Sam, why did you ask him
to follow you here?

387
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,494
Don't talk to your
brother-in-law that way.

388
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,079
I'm sorry.

389
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,622
He's just sick.

390
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:37,752
Even if Francis weren't sick, he's a snob.

391
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:45,176
Well, if you need anything,
food or medicine,

392
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,387
just let me know.

393
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:49,222
I'll take care of the bills.

394
00:30:52,433 --> 00:30:56,062
Actually, I thought that maybe
we could get Francis

395
00:30:56,145 --> 00:30:58,898
a private nurse who can watch
over him 24/7

396
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:01,693
because Santiago is
so far away from Manila.

397
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:05,280
I won't be at peace if they're going back
and forth to the hospital without me.

398
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,447
Right.

399
00:31:07,156 --> 00:31:09,117
Why don't they stay with us at our place?

400
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,202
I mean, we have a big house.

401
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:13,037
There's not many of us staying there.

402
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,123
And I'm sure you would be happy
to have them around.

403
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,750
Isn't Ruth there?

404
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,503
Yeah, but it's a big compound.

405
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:25,383
It's just me, Sam, Mama, and Rebecca
living in the house.

406
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:29,762
George is staying in the other house.

407
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:33,725
And if worst comes to worst,
I'll handle them.

408
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,646
It's okay with me.

409
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,691
Really?

410
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:45,987
Even if you were mean to Paco earlier?

411
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,657
Sam, I'm not the only one
who needs guarding.

412
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:50,783
You do too.

413
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,452
I have to make sure that

414
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,871
your husband's family
isn't oppressing you.

415
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,218
Use that pain to make you win this time.

416
00:32:52,178 --> 00:32:53,137
What?

417
00:32:55,723 --> 00:32:59,060
Do you think we don't know
your history with Sam?

418
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,232
We all know about your past.

419
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,776
We know your present.

420
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,863
We might even dictate your future.

421
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:18,663
Pa, that family destroyed my family.

422
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:21,249
After we helped them and took them in,

423
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,209
we ended up losing everything.

424
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:26,212
Use that anger.

425
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,339
Use that pain.

426
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:33,928
Not to get into a catfight, that's petty.

427
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,848
But use it to get ahead of her.

428
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,808
In business.

429
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,184
In life.

430
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,896
Show Sam that you're the better person.

431
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,315
The better wife.

432
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,401
The better woman.

433
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:53,656
You won't get mad if there's trouble?

434
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:55,033
Trouble?

435
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:01,581
That's in the DNA of the Palacios family.

436
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:04,584
You know what?

437
00:34:04,667 --> 00:34:06,669
The first time I saw you,

438
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,338
I instantly liked you.

439
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,091
Do you know why?

440
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:14,385
Because you're scheming.

441
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:18,473
Sure, you're not rich or glamorous

442
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,183
or overachiever,

443
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,644
but you're a fighter.

444
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,106
The right woman for my son.

445
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:36,115
I just hope I'm not wrong about you.

446
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:28,835
Come in, come in.

447
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,545
- Thank you.
- It's okay.

448
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:32,755
Come in.

449
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:38,678
Let me handle it.

450
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:45,810
Mother.

451
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,107
This is beautiful.

452
00:35:51,607 --> 00:35:54,068
- Thank you for destroying nature.
- Francis.

453
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:54,986
Come here.

454
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,574
Thank you, son.

455
00:36:04,328 --> 00:36:07,039
Ma, this is my family.

456
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:09,584
This is my mother, Mercy,
and my brother, Francis.

457
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,169
This is Mama Aurora.

458
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:14,589
So, you are Sam's family.

459
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,007
Good day.

460
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:18,092
I have something for you,
my son-in-law's mother.

461
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,468
These are delicious.

462
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:27,268
"Ma'am."

463
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,479
I'd prefer you to call me "Ma'am Aurora,"
not your in-law.

464
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,066
Oh.

465
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,030
All right.

466
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:40,656
Yes, ma'am.

467
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,366
You know the rules, Sam.

468
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:46,454
You're permitted
to roam around the common area,

469
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:50,208
but the third floor is exclusively mine.

470
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,087
Yes, Mama.

471
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:58,090
Thank you for accommodating my family.

472
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,508
Oh, don't thank me.

473
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,469
Thank your husband.

474
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:03,888
This was all his plan.

475
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,514
Because if I'd had it my way,

476
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:10,353
I'd have preferred not to
turn my house into an evacuation center.

477
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,563
Now if you will excuse me…

478
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,275
I will just feed my dogs.

479
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:17,777
Thanks for this.

480
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,626
That's the gazebo.

481
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:37,505
We often hang out there
because it's in front of the pool.

482
00:37:37,588 --> 00:37:39,590
Wow. It's so relaxing.

483
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:41,592
Tomorrow, we can go swimming.

484
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,302
- All right.
- Right?

485
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:46,389
Or we can have a picnic
since the place is huge.

486
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:49,558
My goodness,
I'm sure you'll enjoy it here, Mother.

487
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,519
There are a lot of places
around the compound you can go.

488
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:54,272
- There are a lot of trees.
- And the pool is there.

489
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,817
- Well?
- The air is fresh here.

490
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,612
You know, Francis,
you will recover here easily.

491
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,284
Mother, just say I might die here.

492
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:10,162
You saw how Paco's mother
talked to us earlier.

493
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:12,748
Imagine it. We'll see her every day.

494
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,169
What's with you?
You'll get used to it eventually.

495
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:18,713
Just remember, if she says something,

496
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,923
let it go through one ear
and out the other.

497
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,842
As for me, I'm just ignoring it.
What's important to me is…

498
00:38:22,925 --> 00:38:24,343
What are you doing here?

499
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:33,060
They're going to live here
in my house with Paco.

500
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:34,645
Is there a problem?

501
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,441
Your envy of our family is something else.

502
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:41,736
First, you destroyed our family.

503
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,489
Now, you're going to mess up our house.

504
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,199
What did you say?

505
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,326
"Your" house?

506
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,037
You are also just staying here.

507
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,039
Your family name isn't Palacios.
It's Balay, right?

508
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,749
That's nothing like "Palacios."

509
00:38:56,125 --> 00:38:57,335
That's enough.

510
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,086
Let's just leave.

511
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,880
Get out, you immoral people!

512
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,965
Though, if you think about it,
the mother is immoral,

513
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:05,217
so it makes sense that
the children are too!

514
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,720
You're too much!

515
00:39:07,803 --> 00:39:08,679
- Mother.
- Mother.

516
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:10,639
You know, I was being patient with you!

517
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,100
- You can insult me, but not my children!
- Well, it's the truth!

518
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:15,353
You are termites! You destroy houses!

519
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,480
Termites, really?
Who are you calling termites?

520
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,774
- You're going too far!
- Mother! Mother!

521
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,525
- You are too much.
- Stop it.

522
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:23,027
- Let go of me!
- Wait. Wait!

523
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,195
That's enough. Mother!

524
00:39:24,278 --> 00:39:26,572
What the hell is happening here?

525
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:29,367
- Please stop it.
- Mother!

526
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,451
Mother!

527
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:37,291
- You witch!
- Enough, Mother! Stop it!

528
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,752
- Enough, Mother.
- You're all troublemakers!

529
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,879
- Did you see what happened?
- Mother…

530
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:46,884
You turned my house into a market.
A wet market.

531
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,346
And you, Ruth…

532
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,307
Why don't you have a little class?

533
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,309
Or at least fake it,

534
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,478
like how your daughter is faking it.

535
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:07,029
My goodness, these people!

536
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:24,839
It's your fault, Mother.

537
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:28,259
You should've called us first
before you confronted them

538
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:30,219
instead of going three versus one.

539
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,929
Of course you were at a disadvantage!

540
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,515
That Mercy is so irritating.

541
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,975
Don't worry, Mother.

542
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,601
We'll get back at them.

543
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:39,395
Hey, you too.

544
00:40:39,478 --> 00:40:41,730
Ceasefire first.
No one will cause trouble.

545
00:40:41,814 --> 00:40:43,065
What, you just want to let it slide?

546
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:45,526
You want us to do nothing?

547
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,445
No retaliation?

548
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,238
That's not fair!

549
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,825
We are the aggrieved party here, George.

550
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,786
They are the reason Father died.

551
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,539
You were an adult already when he died.

552
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:03,586
At least you were able
to spend a long time with him.

553
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,588
What about me?

554
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,756
I was just a kid then, George.

555
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,719
I lost my father.

556
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:14,472
And now what do you want?

557
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,390
For us not to do anything here?

558
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,187
Who says we won't be doing anything?

559
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:23,105
Who says we won't seek revenge?

560
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,110
I don't want the Palacios family
to think that we're war freaks.

561
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,906
But make no mistake,
we will get our revenge.

562
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:36,160
We will be Sam's family's karma.

563
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,967
I'm sorry about earlier, Sam.

564
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,677
I wasn't able to control myself.

565
00:41:53,761 --> 00:41:56,055
And because of that,
Ma'am Aurora picked on you.

566
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:57,515
Don't worry about it, Mother.

567
00:41:58,224 --> 00:41:59,266
That's nothing to me.

568
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:03,687
They're not the reason why I'm here.
I'm here because of my husband.

569
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,314
I love Paco.

570
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:11,779
But you know, Mother, I'm also surprised
by how much he loves me.

571
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,451
He is willing to give up all this
just for me.

572
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:23,415
They are so rich. Wow.

573
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:26,126
Never in my life

574
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:28,879
did I think

575
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:32,007
that we'd live in this kind of house, Sam.

576
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,636
They are rich,

577
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,514
but are they happy?

578
00:43:01,954 --> 00:43:03,122
Paco…

579
00:43:03,956 --> 00:43:06,000
You need to get rid of them.

580
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,085
What?

581
00:43:08,168 --> 00:43:10,754
Send Sam's family away.

582
00:43:10,838 --> 00:43:13,465
They are turning my house
into a wrestling arena.

583
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,925
It's embarrassing!

584
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:19,513
What's the next scandal they will
inflict on our family?

585
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:22,057
Our family has had scandals
for a long time,

586
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,976
they've just been hidden.

587
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:27,229
Let them leave now.

588
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,233
Okay.

589
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:34,028
Okay.

590
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,701
I'm just packing away my photography stuff

591
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:44,330
so that I can focus more
on my role in the company.

592
00:43:49,043 --> 00:43:51,462
I guess I'll just find
another job in Manila.

593
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,589
Are you threatening me?

594
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,174
I'm just saying

595
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:57,593
that wherever Sam and her family are,

596
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:59,178
that's where I'll be.

597
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,096
They're my family too.

598
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:04,767
What about me?

599
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:06,810
I'm your mother.

600
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,312
Your own blood.

601
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,231
I carried you inside me, Paco.

602
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:13,901
That woman is my wife.

603
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,199
Next time, don't make me choose

604
00:44:21,408 --> 00:44:24,286
because you won't like my choice.

605
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,522
If you called for me

606
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:53,524
because of what happened
between Mother and Auntie Mercy,

607
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:56,026
I'd like to apologize for that.

608
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,986
It will not happen again.

609
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,948
That's not the reason
why I called you, George.

610
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,617
You and me,

611
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,786
we have a common enemy.

612
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,454
It's Sam.

613
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,790
She ruined your family

614
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,544
and she stole my son away from me.

615
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:17,589
I'm no longer surprised that
there's trouble here

616
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,217
because she's a termite.

617
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,720
Every house she goes to gets destroyed.

618
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:31,728
You can easily exterminate termites.

619
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,315
You will kill her?

620
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,529
Don't be ridiculous, George.

621
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:44,158
Do I look like a killer to you?

622
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:50,414
You've known Sam since college,

623
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:54,793
so you know her better than
anyone in this house.

624
00:45:55,294 --> 00:45:57,671
Tell me more about Sam.

625
00:45:57,754 --> 00:45:59,840
What is she like?

626
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:02,342
Sam is intelligent.

627
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,677
She is a fighter.

628
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,263
She is principled.

629
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,641
She will fight for what she believes in

630
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,269
and she loves her family.

631
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,690
Family-oriented.

632
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,651
Interesting.

633
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:24,490
When it comes to her family,
she is ready to kill.

634
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:26,575
She and her brother.

635
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:32,915
A person's biggest strength
is also her biggest weakness.

636
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,417
Did you say family?

637
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,880
Do you think

638
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:44,384
that if we make Sam choose
between Paco and her family,

639
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,514
she will choose them or him?

640
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,980
Good.

641
00:46:57,814 --> 00:47:00,108
You've answered my question.

642
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,694
That's all. You may go.

643
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,549
What was that all about?

644
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,927
Why are you paranoid, Paco?

645
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:32,015
George and I just had a casual talk.

646
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,393
Nothing is ever casual with you.

647
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:38,564
There is always a motive.
There is always an agenda.

648
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,026
Why did you talk to George?

649
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,322
Before, you never
paid attention to her, right?

650
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:53,453
Why the sudden interest
in my wife's mortal enemy?

651
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:58,542
So…

652
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:01,420
you feel

653
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,839
this has something to do with Sam.

654
00:48:05,799 --> 00:48:06,883
Paco,

655
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,762
if you and Sam really love each other,

656
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:13,140
then you shouldn't be bothered.

657
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:17,436
Nothing and no one can ruin your marriage.

658
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:19,938
Not even me.

659
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,457
<i>Have you heard?</i>

660
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,168
<i>Your son and his wife had a fight.</i>

661
00:48:41,251 --> 00:48:43,086
<i>They hardly know each other.</i>

662
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:44,379
<i>Well, if you think about it…</i>

663
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:48,967
What if she finds out what Paco did
five years ago?

664
00:48:49,051 --> 00:48:50,844
Shut up, Galvan!

665
00:48:50,927 --> 00:48:51,803
Really, Aurora?

666
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:53,430
You'll cover for Paco again?

667
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:55,974
Just like you covered for him
after what he did to Dr. Orly?

668
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,809
<i>Did you have something</i>
<i>to do with his death?</i>

669
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:00,270
No! I had nothing to do with Dr. Orly.

670
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,023
He didn't commit suicide.
He was killed!

671
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,691
Paco did something to Papa!

672
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:06,234
Calm down, Francis.

673
00:49:06,318 --> 00:49:08,028
I will not calm down.
I need to do something.

674
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,614
NEXT EPISODE

675
00:49:10,697 --> 00:49:12,491
You killed my son!

676
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,869
I didn't kill him.

677
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:17,579
I love Paco!

678
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,247
I love Paco…

679
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:20,999
I also came to see you.

680
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,250
I want to talk to you.

681
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:24,086
The investigation is over, right?

682
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:25,128
It's about us.

683
00:49:25,212 --> 00:49:28,215
I don't know why you gave me
that kind of investigator.

684
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:29,383
Replace him!

685
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,510
And don't accept any statement from Basil.

686
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,427
He's a liar.

687
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,262
Have you found anything out yet
about what happened to Paco?

688
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,430
Did he really do it?

689
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,557
- Did he commit suicide?
- Shut up, George!

690
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,518
Stop the investigation.
There's no need for that!

691
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:40,644
It was me!

692
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:42,771
I killed Paco!
