1
00:01:06,024 --> 00:01:08,026
<i>Some people are just bitter</i>

2
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,695
because they can't conceive a baby.

3
00:01:10,779 --> 00:01:11,529
PREVIOUSLY

4
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,239
George is infertile?

5
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:17,327
One million jackpot prize
for the lucky guesser?

6
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,330
You're really pulling out all the stops
for this party.

7
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,998
- It's a boy!
- Yes!

8
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:24,709
- It's a boy!
- It's a boy!

9
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,753
- It's a boy!
- Congratulations!

10
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,088
- We should choose the lucky guesser.
- All right, all right.

11
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,217
It's George!

12
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,510
Yes!

13
00:01:33,593 --> 00:01:35,929
Get your prize. One million pesos.

14
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,013
It's okay, Pa.

15
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:38,807
You can give that to someone else.

16
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,976
You can use this money
for you to buy a baby

17
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,728
since you can never conceive one.

18
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:47,023
What? George cannot conceive a baby?

19
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:49,526
<i>They didn't know that you're barren?</i>

20
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:52,737
I swear to God, I will stab this woman!

21
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,739
- George.
- Wow.

22
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:57,325
That's quite a scene she made there.

23
00:01:57,408 --> 00:02:01,788
It seems like George is
more than capable of killing.

24
00:02:01,871 --> 00:02:03,498
What do you think, Amando?

25
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:08,586
Ma'am George's eyes were so angry.
It seemed like she was ready to kill.

26
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:11,965
Oh, please! Don't remind me of it.
I just want to forget about it.

27
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,591
<i>You had something to do with</i>
<i>what happened earlier.</i>

28
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,010
Mother, I need to expose George's secrets.

29
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,178
It's like the domino effect.

30
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,513
One will fall after another

31
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:22,016
until the truth comes out that she was
the mastermind behind Basil's death.

32
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,435
<i>- Who told you to touch my things?</i>
<i>- I did.</i>

33
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,355
I asked them to transfer your things
and your family

34
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,523
to the condo in Makati.

35
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:30,150
You're kicking me out?

36
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,488
I am not kicking you out.

37
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,950
I'm just giving space
between you and Beverly.

38
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,910
Don't worry.

39
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:44,998
You will still get your monthly allowance,
and for your family.

40
00:02:45,456 --> 00:02:46,666
But I was here first.

41
00:02:46,749 --> 00:02:48,376
Why do I have to adjust?

42
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:51,880
Because she is pregnant and you're not.

43
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,134
George cannot conceive a baby?

44
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,054
They didn't know that you're barren?

45
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,057
Yes, I'm barren,

46
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,768
but that was never an issue with Basil.

47
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:10,231
In fact, when he found out the truth,
he still accepted me.

48
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:12,025
It's okay.

49
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,776
Nothing changes.

50
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,486
All right?

51
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:18,364
My love for you will never change.

52
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,950
If we can't have children,

53
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,535
so be it.

54
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:24,454
It will just be you and me,

55
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:26,706
from this day

56
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,876
until the end of our days.

57
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,004
When did this happen?

58
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:35,256
During his birthday party.

59
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,383
You're just telling it to me now?

60
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,303
How would I know
if you're telling the truth?

61
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:44,057
You already lied about your condition.

62
00:03:47,268 --> 00:03:49,270
I will apologize to Beverly.

63
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:52,023
I will kneel in front of her if I have to.

64
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,107
Don't…

65
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,028
you ever go near Beverly again!

66
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:05,787
I can't believe this.

67
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,790
Guys.

68
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:11,709
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

69
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:12,961
No.

70
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:17,507
We promised Ward that
we would never suspect his family.

71
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,510
But we all witnessed what his sister did.

72
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,762
She almost hurt Beverly

73
00:04:24,055 --> 00:04:25,974
and your future nephew.

74
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:27,850
- I know but--
- Sofia!

75
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:31,771
Don't tell me
you're going to side with Ward?

76
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:36,901
The reason we created Crimebusters
wasn't only to solve mysteries.

77
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:41,656
Our friendship and loyalty
are important too.

78
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:42,532
Oh my God.

79
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:46,160
So now is not the time to drop Ward.

80
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,371
Open your eyes, Sofia!

81
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:50,331
Oh my gosh.

82
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:51,457
Sofia?

83
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:53,459
Please, Sofia.

84
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,461
Don't side with that family!

85
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:58,089
You might get dragged into
that mess later on.

86
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:01,843
Please don't do this to me.

87
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,136
I'm begging you.

88
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,391
I'm giving you one day

89
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:11,936
to pack your belongings.

90
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:52,560
And you, what are you still doing here?

91
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,689
Go home! Party's over!

92
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,025
Go!

93
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:05,364
Mommy!

94
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,574
You too?

95
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,036
Do you believe that George
is capable of murder?

96
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:22,340
I don't know.

97
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,969
But one thing's for sure.

98
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:30,056
Once they've proven

99
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,310
that George killed Basil,

100
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:38,523
she will definitely not be
inheriting anything.

101
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:42,652
And if that happens…

102
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,864
it only means one thing.

103
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,493
Your inheritance will be bigger.

104
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:45,024
No one can know the truth

105
00:08:45,107 --> 00:08:47,777
until I've found out the real reason
mine and Rebecca's father died.

106
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,738
So that's why you're kind
to Ma'am Rebecca.

107
00:08:50,821 --> 00:08:52,865
<i>You have the same father.</i>

108
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:33,698
Finally, Galvan has come to his senses.

109
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,617
George and her family are leaving.

110
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:38,452
One family down,

111
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,288
a few more to go.

112
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:43,958
Is that why you want to celebrate?

113
00:09:45,835 --> 00:09:48,087
You may leave now, Amando.

114
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:51,757
I want to enjoy this meal all by myself.

115
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:55,386
Oh, and don't forget
to lock the door, please.

116
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,763
Thank you, Amando.

117
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,494
Are you here to visit someone, ma'am?

118
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,204
Yes. Francis Castillo.

119
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,122
- Yes.
- Just sign there, ma'am.

120
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,666
Thank you.

121
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:22,765
Castillo, you have a visitor.

122
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,435
Who is it, sir?

123
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,484
So much is happening in this house

124
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,696
even I couldn't keep up.

125
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,542
You would love it.

126
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,303
Aren't you drinking?

127
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:45,473
It's your favorite, pinot noir.

128
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:17,856
George?

129
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:27,658
- George! George!
- You destroyed my whole life!

130
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:30,369
- Hold on, George!
- You're the cause of all my misfortunes!

131
00:14:30,452 --> 00:14:31,787
- Wait!
- My problems just keep coming non-stop.

132
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,665
George! George, I'm innocent!
I didn't kill Basil, George!

133
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,042
You didn't just kill my husband!

134
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,336
You killed my hopes, my dreams,
and my protection!

135
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,131
- George, believe me. I'm innocent!
- You fool!

136
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:45,217
George! George, believe me!
I'm innocent, George!

137
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:47,136
- George, I didn't kill Basil!
- You're a monster.

138
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,389
Let go of him!
Don't hurt my brother!

139
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,941
He deserves far worse than this!

140
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:03,319
Francis is innocent.

141
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,613
No Castillo is innocent!

142
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,615
Your brother, your mother, and you too!

143
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,867
All of you bring nothing but trouble
into my life!

144
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:18,959
George!

145
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,295
George!

146
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,339
What, Sam?

147
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,633
What do you want to hear from me?

148
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:27,635
Congratulations! You won!

149
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,136
You have everything!

150
00:15:30,387 --> 00:15:32,640
You have the Palacios name,
you have that baby,

151
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,143
and you will have the whole estate
all to yourself!

152
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,480
You're leaving?

153
00:15:42,942 --> 00:15:43,817
George, you can't leave.

154
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:46,278
Francis' case is not yet over.

155
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,280
Really, Sam?

156
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:51,700
I will lose a house,

157
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,495
but your only concern is your brother!

158
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,626
You know, I shouldn't leave.

159
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:05,547
I should just stay here
until your brother rots in jail.

160
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,550
Francis is innocent, George.

161
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:12,554
As soon as Francis is sentenced,
I will target you next, Sam.

162
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:16,016
And your mother too, and Beverly.

163
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:20,062
All of you who destroyed my life will pay!

164
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,651
George cannot conceive a baby?

165
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,114
They didn't know that you're barren?

166
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,391
Where are you?

167
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:41,393
Are you on the way?

168
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:04,458
George?

169
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,834
- Is that Ward?
- Wait, that's Ward.

170
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,169
George!

171
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,212
Ward…

172
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:11,340
Why are you still here?

173
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,300
We heard what happened.

174
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:14,843
You're leaving?

175
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,764
We're packing our things.

176
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:22,059
Do you need help?

177
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:24,853
It's…

178
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,565
George has been missing for a while now.

179
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,276
She isn't even answering my texts.

180
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,237
Isn't she inside?

181
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,031
- Ward, maybe she's somewhere around.
- I don't really know.

182
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,950
- Yeah.
- We'll help you find her.

183
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:40,577
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

184
00:18:40,661 --> 00:18:42,204
Sofia, let's go.

185
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,392
Protect…

186
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:46,935
Household…

187
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,813
Evil…

188
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:03,410
Protect this household from evil spirits.

189
00:20:28,393 --> 00:20:33,857
Protect this household from evil spirits.

190
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:42,741
Protect this household from evil spirits.

191
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:50,165
Protect this household from evil spirits.

192
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,505
Protect this household from evil spirits.

193
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:01,218
Protect this household…

194
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,347
from evil…

195
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:09,268
spirits.

196
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,033
Who are you?

197
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,911
Don't hurt me.

198
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,248
Don't come near me.

199
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,125
Help! Help!

200
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:35,377
Help me!

201
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,087
Help me! Help!

202
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,549
George!

203
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,967
George!

204
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,176
George, where are you?

205
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,638
Where are you?

206
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,521
- Jeff?
- Yeah?

207
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:56,690
What if you and Ward go to the garden?

208
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,483
- Okay, Louie. Let's go, Ward.
- Sofia and I will check here.

209
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,443
Hurry up.

210
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,004
Help me!

211
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,342
Help me!

212
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,978
Why?

213
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:36,688
Why are you shouting?

214
00:22:38,732 --> 00:22:40,317
- What's wrong?
- What's up?

215
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,488
It's Bev!

216
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,490
She needs our help.

217
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,657
What?

218
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,207
Oh…

219
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:57,000
Oh no.

220
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,504
Ward, we gotta go.

221
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:01,379
Let's go.

222
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,592
Help!

223
00:23:05,675 --> 00:23:07,636
Help! Help me!

224
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:10,597
Help!

225
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:12,641
Help!

226
00:23:16,394 --> 00:23:17,854
Daddy!

227
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:18,897
- Yes, Sofia?
- It's Bev!

228
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,357
She's in danger!

229
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,566
- What?
- Come on!

230
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,318
Gotta go, Uncle! Let's go!

231
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,750
Oh!

232
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:44,339
Protect this household from evil spirits.

233
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:50,679
Protect this household from evil spirits.

234
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:11,324
Beverly!

235
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:13,201
Open this door!

236
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,704
- Help!
- Beverly!

237
00:24:16,538 --> 00:24:17,664
Beverly!

238
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:19,916
Open this door!

239
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,042
Beverly!

240
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,044
Beverly!

241
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,589
Protect this household from evil spirits.

242
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:30,135
Protect this household from evil spirits.

243
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,057
Beverly!

244
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,857
- No! Please!
- Beverly!

245
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,402
Protect this household

246
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,488
from evil spirits.

247
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:52,657
Come on! Beverly!

248
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,700
No!

249
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,868
Beverly!

250
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,326
Beverly!

251
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,246
Beverly!

252
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:42,582
Look for the person who did this to her!

253
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,125
- Hurry up!
- Yes, sir.

254
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:45,001
Beverly!

255
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:46,294
Beverly!

256
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,097
Who did this to you?

257
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,235
Oh no!

258
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:12,737
Let's go.

259
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:13,905
Let's go!

260
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,117
Hurry up. Let's go!

261
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:20,036
Beverly!

262
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,294
- Peter!
- Sir!

263
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:29,087
Call an ambulance!

264
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,588
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir.

265
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,840
Beverly!

266
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,717
Beverly!

267
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:34,843
Hello?

268
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:37,345
Hello?

269
00:26:38,972 --> 00:26:41,141
Sir, I didn't see anyone.

270
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:43,268
The person who stabbed Beverly
was right here!

271
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,104
The person who killed her
is still close by!

272
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,397
Find that person!

273
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:48,857
Find them!

274
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,696
You're really pulling out all the stops
for this party.

275
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:57,741
Come on, Aurora.
It's not just another party.

276
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,911
It's like the rebirth of Basil.

277
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:02,912
Beverly!

278
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:06,082
No! Beverly…

279
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:07,667
Beverly…

280
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:08,585
Sir!

281
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:11,671
The ambulance and the police
are on their way, sir.

282
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:12,964
What's the use?

283
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:14,841
Beverly is dead!

284
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,217
My grandson is dead!

285
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,218
They were killed!

286
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,679
God!

287
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:21,473
Beverly…

288
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:26,478
- Look for the person who killed her!
- Okay, sir.

289
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:30,857
My grandson…

290
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:32,817
My grandson…

291
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:52,128
Cairo, here!

292
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,213
Cairo!

293
00:27:53,671 --> 00:27:54,672
Cairo, here!

294
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:32,210
Ma'am, you can stay here. That way,
you'll be near Sir Galvan's room.

295
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,297
And, ma'am, here.

296
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,926
If you need anything, just call me.

297
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:42,137
Thank you.

298
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:44,764
Thank you.

299
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:46,057
Okay, ma'am.

300
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,393
I'll go ahead.

301
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:49,728
Hold on.

302
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,521
Can I have that?

303
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:01,614
So that just in case someone tries
to hurt me, I can defend myself.

304
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:15,962
Are you okay, Beverly?

305
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:18,089
- Are you okay here?
- Of course.

306
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,175
More than okay.

307
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:21,259
Okay.

308
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,510
So…

309
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:24,846
Don't forget our agreement, okay?

310
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,766
One million pesos.

311
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:29,893
What for?

312
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,481
I called you in your province

313
00:29:34,564 --> 00:29:38,818
to inform you that Sir Basil was dead.

314
00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:45,033
So, you wouldn't be here now
if it hadn't been for me.

315
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,162
A million? Just for that?

316
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:50,872
Are you a scammer?

317
00:29:51,456 --> 00:29:54,834
Don't double-cross me, Beverly.

318
00:29:57,378 --> 00:30:00,006
Because I'm different when I get mad.

319
00:30:47,303 --> 00:30:48,388
Ma'am!

320
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,806
Madam!

321
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,808
Ma'am Aurora!

322
00:30:51,891 --> 00:30:53,142
- What?
- Ma'am!

323
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:56,271
Madam!

324
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:58,189
Ma'am Aurora! Madam!

325
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:00,233
What's with you? My goodness!

326
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,485
What?

327
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,362
Your voice is so annoying!

328
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,947
I'm sorry!

329
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,367
I'm sorry, but Ms. Beverly
has had an emergency.

330
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,953
So what are you waiting for?
Bring her to the hospital!

331
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,413
It's too late.

332
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,039
She's dead.

333
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,333
Oh my God, what?

334
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,085
Someone stabbed her.

335
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:21,921
Who stabbed her?

336
00:31:22,338 --> 00:31:25,717
I don't know,
but they're looking for the killer now.

337
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:30,597
And, madam, they said that
the killer is still in the area.

338
00:31:34,309 --> 00:31:35,935
Where's Samantha?

339
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,312
Let's look for Sam!

340
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:38,605
Go, go, go, Angie!

341
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,482
Is Ma'am Samantha there?

342
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,359
Oh my God.

343
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,821
Our Father who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy Name.

344
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:50,241
Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

345
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:52,452
Why is there still a lot of blood?

346
00:31:54,203 --> 00:31:55,663
Bev is still moving.

347
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:58,291
Her hand is still moving.

348
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:03,212
- It's called rigor mortis.
- What?

349
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:08,217
When a person dies, their body
makes unnecessary movements.

350
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:14,474
The muscles soften and the body goes limp,

351
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,562
and the liquids from the dead
are also released.

352
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,522
- Louie.
- What the heck, man?

353
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,580
Be quiet there and just help me pray.

354
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,957
What's with you?

355
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,000
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

356
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:44,128
Blessed art thou amongst women
and blessed is the fruit…

357
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,922
Hey, hey, where are you going?

358
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:47,131
Just stay here!

359
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,300
The killer is on the loose!

360
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,719
That's the thing.
The killer is on the loose.

361
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,346
They might hurt George.

362
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:55,723
- Ward…
- Hey, Ward!

363
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,892
Ward, come back here!

364
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,936
My God, this kid.

365
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,981
Lord, Lord, please,
Lord, help them.

366
00:33:03,856 --> 00:33:07,527
Protect this household from evil spirits!

367
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,823
Protect this household from evil spirits!

368
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:16,619
- Protect this household from evil spirits.
- I'll just go to Mother.

369
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:17,954
- Hold on.
- No, Sam!

370
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:21,124
- Protect this household from…
- You stay here.

371
00:33:21,207 --> 00:33:22,542
I already told you.

372
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,252
Your mother is safe.

373
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:31,676
No one will leave this room unless
we are assured that it's safe outside.

374
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:32,969
Do you understand?

375
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:34,721
Yes, madam.

376
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:39,642
Amando, anyone who tries
to enter that door,

377
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:42,228
don't hesitate to shoot them.

378
00:34:19,849 --> 00:34:24,520
Protect this household from evil spirits.

379
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:28,858
Protect this household from evil spirits!

380
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:31,944
- Protect this household…
- Come with me, Ma'am Rebecca.

381
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,571
…from evil spirits!

382
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:34,822
Who's there?

383
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,617
Who's there?

384
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:41,329
Who's that?

385
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:52,924
Mother!

386
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:02,600
Mother! Hold on, hold on!

387
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:03,768
My God, Mercy!

388
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:05,895
We almost shot you!

389
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,356
I thought you were inside your room!

390
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:10,566
I was worried about Sam.

391
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,819
Mother, come here.

392
00:35:12,902 --> 00:35:14,403
- What happened?
- Are you okay?

393
00:35:14,487 --> 00:35:16,364
I'm okay. How about you?

394
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:18,324
What's happening?

395
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,034
Mother.

396
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:21,244
Sam.

397
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,204
My God.

398
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:25,873
I'm so sorry, Sam.

399
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:37,135
Go, go, go.

400
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,221
Thank you. Thank you.

401
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,306
Amando, what is it?

402
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:45,184
Everyone is safe to go outside.

403
00:36:16,257 --> 00:36:17,300
Ma'am Rebecca?

404
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,552
What are you doing here?

405
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:24,724
Well…

406
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:31,606
I was bothered when you kept
asking about Papa last night,

407
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:37,195
so I came here to clear things out.

408
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,328
But I saw that.

409
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,131
That's what Bev's killer was wearing.

410
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,223
Was it you…

411
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,602
who killed Bev,

412
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,271
Jerico?

413
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,323
Ma'am Rebecca, no.

414
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,283
I had nothing to do with
what happened to Ma'am Bev.

415
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:32,500
Ma'am Rebecca…

416
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:34,043
- Please, ma'am.
- Let me go.

417
00:37:34,126 --> 00:37:35,753
Okay. Okay. Ma'am.

418
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:36,712
Ma'am.

419
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,256
Ma'am, okay.

420
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:41,717
Okay, if you have doubts about me,
have me investigated.

421
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,971
You can even give that hoodie
to Sergeant Casas.

422
00:37:45,846 --> 00:37:47,807
But please, listen to me first.

423
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:49,892
What else do I have to listen to?

424
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:55,231
The reason I'm asking about
your papa is because…

425
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,859
Because?

426
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:00,361
Why?

427
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,492
I'll talk to the investigator.

428
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:08,452
What the--

429
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,954
I am a Palacios.

430
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,001
I am the son of Rodolfo Palacios.

431
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:17,628
Your father.

432
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:21,090
We're siblings, Ma'am Rebecca.

433
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,884
No, that's not true.

434
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:27,263
What are you saying?

435
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,269
What's that?

436
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,312
Look at it.

437
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:54,749
No…

438
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:03,341
No…

439
00:39:13,225 --> 00:39:14,685
Papa…

440
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,772
This is Papa.

441
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,943
I am the little boy he is carrying.

442
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:30,701
No…

443
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,789
I miss Papa's voice.

444
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,565
How did you learn that song?

445
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:05,361
Papa made that song for me.

446
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,947
My mother memorized it

447
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:12,535
and she often sang that to me after

448
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,787
Papa didn't return.

449
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:21,168
<i>Hush, my baby</i>

450
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:23,921
<i>Don't you cry</i>

451
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:28,801
<i>In a starry night</i>

452
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,971
<i>Look up at the sky</i>

453
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,726
<i>Spread your wings</i>

454
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:45,943
<i>Spread your wings and start to fly</i>

455
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,574
<i>Go to sleep</i>

456
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:58,414
<i>With my lullaby</i>

457
00:41:10,801 --> 00:41:12,178
You know what?

458
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:14,638
Papa used to sing that song for me too.

459
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,477
But as far as I remember…

460
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:24,899
only the two of us knew about that.

461
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:41,957
So, the dream I had of two new members
of the Palacios family…

462
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:47,379
You're the second Palacios,
not Bev's baby.

463
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:52,009
Oh my God.

464
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:53,260
Just…

465
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:56,889
I can't believe that I have a brother.

466
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,727
So…

467
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,564
I'll call you "big brother"?

468
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:08,442
Oh, please, don't call me ma'am.

469
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,069
Don't call me "ma'am," okay?

470
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:17,785
Wait, yes! I should prepare
a welcome party for you!

471
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:18,744
Don't!

472
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:20,287
Why?

473
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,499
No one should know that we're siblings,

474
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:25,626
especially not Ma'am Aurora.

475
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,461
Because

476
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,630
she might do to me
what she did to my mother.

477
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,841
What did Auntie Aurora do to her?

478
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,224
When she found out

479
00:42:41,183 --> 00:42:43,227
that my mother was Papa's girlfriend,

480
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,689
she made it look like my mother
stole from the company.

481
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:48,983
Auntie did that?

482
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,693
Yes.

483
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:54,780
Papa helped her escape
just before she could get arrested

484
00:42:54,863 --> 00:42:57,658
and hid her in the provinces.

485
00:42:57,741 --> 00:42:58,826
So…

486
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,496
Wait.

487
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,415
You mean to say…

488
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:09,878
the reason you're here is because you're
seeking revenge on Auntie?

489
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,338
What?

490
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:12,673
No.

491
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,091
I'm looking for Papa.

492
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,884
But Papa is dead.

493
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:17,469
He died a long time ago.

494
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,887
Rebecca, no.

495
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,890
I've been suspecting for a long time
that he's still alive.

496
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,310
I opened his coffin and it was empty.

497
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:36,614
What?

498
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:31,251
<i>A gold digger can bury herself</i>
<i>if she digs in too deep.</i>

499
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:34,713
So, others should be careful.

500
00:44:34,797 --> 00:44:36,382
If you dig for gold,

501
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:40,678
sometimes what you end up seeing
is the Angel of Death's sickle.

502
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,221
NEXT EPISODE

503
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,139
<i>Stabbing was the method of killing,</i>

504
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:45,933
but the murder weapon is missing.

505
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:49,853
Sir, did you find a knife
in Ms. Beverly's things?

506
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,021
No, why?

507
00:44:51,105 --> 00:44:54,983
Peter, didn't Ms. Beverly ask for
the knife in the pig's head?

508
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:57,277
Maybe that was used to kill her.

509
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,071
<i>What did you do to my brother?</i>

510
00:44:59,154 --> 00:45:00,739
He got involved in a riot, ma'am.

511
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,116
<i>I'm okay, Sam.</i>

512
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,492
<i>I'm getting used to it.</i>

513
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:04,910
Actually, I am already ready.

514
00:45:04,993 --> 00:45:06,412
Ready for what, Francis?

515
00:45:06,495 --> 00:45:07,871
I'm ready to die.

516
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:09,915
Francis, don't say that.

517
00:45:10,416 --> 00:45:11,708
That's where I'm headed.

518
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:13,502
<i>I have cancer, remember?</i>

519
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,087
<i>That's where I'll end up.</i>

520
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,755
<i>I will die too.</i>
