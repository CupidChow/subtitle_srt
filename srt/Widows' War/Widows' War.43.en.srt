1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,348
Why did you ask me to come here?

2
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:17,684
This is about the death of my father.

3
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:20,186
I have a strong hunch
that there was a foul play.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:22,230
You need an evidence or a witness.

5
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,566
<i>Belen, the caretaker. She knows something.</i>

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,068
<i>Rico, where is Belen?</i>

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:28,028
<i>Oh, Ma'am, she just left.</i>

8
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:30,530
Sir Amando asked me to take her
to the bus terminal going to Leyte.

9
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:32,657
Sarge, there's a cover-up happening here.

10
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,451
Help me get justice for my father.

11
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,494
Welcome to my office.
So, what do you want?

12
00:00:36,578 --> 00:00:37,620
What do I want?

13
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:38,830
To sue Sam.

14
00:00:38,913 --> 00:00:39,748
Forget about her.

15
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:41,624
But, I promise you,

16
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:45,086
if Sam hurts you again,
I will take action against her.

17
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,087
Go. Go.

18
00:00:46,171 --> 00:00:47,172
- Dad.
- Hey.

19
00:00:47,255 --> 00:00:49,174
Slowly, you'll get well.

20
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:50,550
I don't want to be in a wheelchair,

21
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:52,177
especially if I face the board.

22
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,221
There's no need to do that, Galvan.

23
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,266
I can handle the affairs of my company.

24
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,018
Did you escape from the facility?

25
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:04,731
After a few threats
here and there, they released me.

26
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,316
<i>We have a more important mission.</i>

27
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,735
We need to find something

28
00:01:08,818 --> 00:01:10,487
that connects Mother Aurora to our father.

29
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,280
PREVIOUSLY

30
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,827
Francis, this is
father's prescription note.

31
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,761
Get out of here. Traitor. Cheater.

32
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:17,887
Mercy, forgive me.

33
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,222
This was the first time
I became happy again.

34
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:23,852
Go and be with your <i>"Mi Amore"</i> in hell.

35
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,436
Traitors.

36
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,192
I won't forget my obligation
to you and the children.

37
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,944
I will still send money.

38
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:37,031
We don't need you. Get out of here.

39
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,700
Get out of here. Get out.

40
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:43,413
Leave. Get out here.

41
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:45,290
Cheater.

42
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,584
Traitor.

43
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,598
Sam, it was our father who wrote this.

44
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:03,433
This is his handwriting.

45
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,398
Hello.

46
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,447
Why are you looking at me like that?

47
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,157
Aren't you glad to see me?

48
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:24,704
We're happy that you're here already,

49
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,789
so you can answer our questions.

50
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,417
What question, Sam?

51
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,462
Why did my father write this to you?

52
00:03:38,134 --> 00:03:41,846
Take a tablet

53
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:46,392
once a day.

54
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,492
<i>Take good care of your heart</i>

55
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:08,289
<i>because your heart means so much to me.</i>

56
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:12,543
<i>Your favorite doctor, Orly.</i>

57
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:40,238
Doc Orly prescribed that to me.

58
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:42,448
Why? Is there a problem?

59
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,327
"Your heart means so much to me?"

60
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,955
Is this how
a doctor writes to his patient?

61
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:52,959
Your dad was an unusual doctor, Sam.

62
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,795
Did you have an affair with my father?

63
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,680
You're so evil.

64
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:11,728
Even though I gave you everything…

65
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,774
you still left me.

66
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,076
You still left me.

67
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:34,834
Even though I got hurt…

68
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:41,382
Even though…

69
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:45,303
even though you hurt me…

70
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,809
I still can't get mad at you.

71
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,645
Because…

72
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,733
I love you very much.

73
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,325
I still love you very much.

74
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:25,843
Why did you do that? Why did you do that?

75
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,846
What do you mean by an affair?

76
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,768
An illicit relationship,
extra-marital involvement.

77
00:06:33,851 --> 00:06:34,977
A secret love affair.

78
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,522
Did you become my father's mistress?

79
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,363
What's funny?

80
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:49,117
This. Look at your faces.

81
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:55,790
I thought I'd surprise you
with my return, but lo and behold,

82
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:57,750
I was the one who was surprised.

83
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,086
But, you still didn't answer my question.

84
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,048
Did you become my father's mistress?

85
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,466
No.

86
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:09,137
Does that answer your question, Samantha?

87
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:17,895
So, thanks for the ride,
and text me when you get home.

88
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:19,439
Sure.

89
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,940
Take care.

90
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,409
Hi, George.

91
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,662
Is that Attorney you were talking to?

92
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:36,080
Yes, why?

93
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,459
Why didn't you ask him to come in?

94
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,960
We have a lot of food there.

95
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,712
I could've prepared something for you.

96
00:07:44,088 --> 00:07:45,923
We were just avoiding trouble.

97
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,300
We don't want to trigger Dad.

98
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:53,389
George, this is just a question, okay?

99
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,809
Why doesn't Galvan like Attorney?

100
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:02,482
I'm just wondering
because he's handsome, right?

101
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,859
And he's kind,

102
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:11,073
educated, smart, a lawyer, and rich too.

103
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:18,498
He said Iñigo gave Basil the wrong advice.

104
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:22,418
To be honest, I find that reason shallow.

105
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:26,172
I think there's more to it,
but he just won't say it.

106
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:29,509
What did Attorney say?

107
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:33,930
To just let it be.

108
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,811
George…

109
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:47,777
Well, this is something
that I just thought.

110
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,072
Could it be…

111
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:58,162
I hope you don't mind,
but maybe they're not just best friends,

112
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:01,958
Basil and Iñigo.

113
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,418
I'm sorry?

114
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:06,254
What I mean is…

115
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:12,677
Maybe the reason Galvan
doesn't like Attorney

116
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,473
is because he and Basil
became lovers before?

117
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:21,936
If you were not his mistress,

118
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,521
why did he write to you this way?

119
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,356
"From your favorite doctor?"

120
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:27,775
How many times did he check on you?

121
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,819
My father wasn't that type.

122
00:09:29,902 --> 00:09:32,321
He was professional with his patients.

123
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,825
What do you want me to say, Sam?

124
00:09:35,908 --> 00:09:38,452
Why did my father treat you that way?

125
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,204
Because I'm his boss.

126
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,375
You were also a former employee, right?

127
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:49,380
Don't tell me you never tried
to brownnose your boss?

128
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,717
No. Never.

129
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,845
You got that attitude from Mercy.

130
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:59,432
In the few times that I was with Doc Orly,

131
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,394
he was very cordial.

132
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,147
That is why our miners liked him so much.

133
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,482
They were all devastated

134
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,819
when we found out
that he overdosed on heroin.

135
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:24,915
Iñigo and Basil are best friends,
they are not boyfriends.

136
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:30,338
George, I didn't say now, of course.

137
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,048
That was before.

138
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:34,675
And I'm sure before Basil married you,

139
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,553
for sure he broke up with Iñigo, right?

140
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,015
So, what are you trying to say?
That they're gay?

141
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:45,394
Well…

142
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:48,648
it's possible.

143
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:53,819
But, George. Times are different now.

144
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:58,699
Some gays fall for women.

145
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,868
Some men fall for gays.

146
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:04,538
There's nothing wrong with that.

147
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:06,123
I mean…

148
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:10,336
no judgment because I'm not judgmental.

149
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,796
But…

150
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:19,053
I smell something different from Iñigo.

151
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,055
What?

152
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:24,141
His looks.

153
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:30,272
George, just look at his eyebrows, right?

154
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:36,362
And also Basil, he's like…

155
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:39,156
What?

156
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,409
He's like…

157
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,913
He's like that.

158
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:47,998
He seems soft.

159
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,960
His fingers seem to flutter.

160
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,628
And a bit effeminate.

161
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:55,297
My husband is not gay.

162
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:16,318
I'm happy you're back, madam.

163
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,698
But, there's a new problem.

164
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,076
I know.

165
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:26,370
It's Sam.

166
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:32,168
She thinks I had an affair
with her father.

167
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,629
She's also investigating
her father's death.

168
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,965
She wants to know what really happened.

169
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,677
She can't know the truth, Amando.

170
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:45,222
I'd rather she thinks
that I'm a flirt than…

171
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:52,354
than find out who really killed Orly.

172
00:12:57,151 --> 00:12:58,736
Basil is straight.

173
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,446
He wanted us to have children.

174
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,657
George,

175
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:08,829
I know a lot of gay people,
but they have families.

176
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:11,457
They have wives and children.

177
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:14,335
No judgment there, I am not judgmental.

178
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:18,714
In fact, most of the gay people
I know with families,

179
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:23,219
are better people than those straight men.

180
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,803
Hey, I'm not really judgmental.

181
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,388
You are being judgmental.

182
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,641
You're thinking that the guy is gay.

183
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:33,687
George, I just said that, but…

184
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,774
but it's okay if you don't
want to believe.

185
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:42,279
You know, I'm just wondering
why Galvan is so mad at Iñigo.

186
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:45,991
But, don't be defensive.

187
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:48,327
Don't get mad, okay?

188
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,788
I'm not judgmental.

189
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,123
I just thought about that. It's nothing.

190
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,835
Well, I'm telling you now,
Vivian, that you're wrong.

191
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:58,879
Basil is a real man, okay?

192
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,881
He is my husband, and I know him better.

193
00:14:01,465 --> 00:14:02,341
Okay, fine.

194
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:13,602
Basil is a real man.

195
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,190
No one would know what
really happened to Dr. Orly.

196
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:23,821
Don't be noisy, Amando.
Someone might hear you.

197
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:28,158
What are we going to do, madam?

198
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,244
From what I know about Sam,

199
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,372
she won't stop until
her questions are answered.

200
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,844
I will give her the closure she wants.

201
00:14:49,847 --> 00:14:52,057
Just not the right one.

202
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:12,077
<i>I know a lot of gay people,</i>
<i>but they have families.</i>

203
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,204
<i>They have wives and children.</i>

204
00:15:16,206 --> 00:15:17,791
George?

205
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:26,634
Mom, Basil is not gay, right?

206
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:32,431
Oh, gosh. George,
please stop talking to Vivian.

207
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,725
You know, she's just
pretending to be nice.

208
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:36,769
Even if snakes change their skins,

209
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:37,728
they are still snakes.

210
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:40,606
Look, she already poisoned your mind.

211
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,069
Mom…

212
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,364
Basil is not gay, right?

213
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:52,326
No, George.

214
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:57,039
You got married, and you're having a baby.

215
00:15:57,122 --> 00:16:00,918
And he even got that villain,
Beverly, pregnant, remember?

216
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:07,383
George, is there a gay who wants a man,

217
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,469
and then looks for a female mistress?

218
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,727
So, what Vivian said is not true?

219
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:23,524
George…

220
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:28,028
Is there a reason for you to think

221
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:31,031
that your husband is having
an affair with a man?

222
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,219
I'll do it.

223
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,846
You both look familiar to me.

224
00:16:54,847 --> 00:16:57,099
Do we know each other? Where did we meet?

225
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:00,019
Sam, do you know him?

226
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:04,398
Maybe we just look like
the people you're talking about.

227
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:05,607
Yeah.

228
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:08,152
Do you know Dr. Orly Castillo?

229
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,654
Yes, he is our father.

230
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:12,698
Why? Are you his patient?

231
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:15,325
Not me, my wife.

232
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,494
Your father is good.

233
00:17:17,578 --> 00:17:20,706
He used to treat my wife's fever,

234
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,584
until he started warming up my wife.

235
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,091
Iñigo…

236
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:35,012
Are you gay?

237
00:17:38,015 --> 00:17:40,392
Hold on, our father
is not that type of person.

238
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:43,562
Where is that Doc Orly <i>"Mi Amore"?</i>

239
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,564
He still owes me a beating.

240
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,858
Our father is long gone.

241
00:17:47,941 --> 00:17:48,776
Let's go.

242
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,236
His soul must be burning in hell.

243
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,198
You're ill-mannered.
Why are you badmouthing our father?

244
00:17:55,324 --> 00:17:56,992
If something really happened
between him and your wife,

245
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,243
then blame your wife.

246
00:17:58,327 --> 00:17:59,578
Take your anger out on her.

247
00:17:59,661 --> 00:18:02,039
She's married, and she
entertained a married man.

248
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:04,041
- Francis…
- You're arrogant.

249
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:05,876
You take after your father.

250
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:08,462
Why, huh? Why don't I punch you instead?

251
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,008
What did you say?

252
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:15,135
Are you gay?

253
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,434
Why are you asking me that?

254
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,355
I'm not going to judge you.

255
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,484
I will accept whatever your response is.

256
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,070
Just answer my question.

257
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:43,747
No.

258
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:45,582
I am not gay.

259
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,626
I am straight.

260
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,924
- Francis, come on. Let's hurry.
- What?

261
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,134
What? What, huh?

262
00:18:55,217 --> 00:18:56,426
Are you going to fight me?

263
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:58,387
Wait a minute. Guard. Guard.

264
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,558
That's enough. Guard. Guard.

265
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,684
Guard…

266
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,061
He ran away.

267
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,896
Francis, are you okay?

268
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,356
I'm okay.

269
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,442
My God.

270
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:14,486
I'm okay.

271
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,240
Why?

272
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,617
What happened?

273
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,587
Why are you suddenly
asking me these things?

274
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,755
Never mind.

275
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:36,842
George…

276
00:19:36,925 --> 00:19:38,552
I answered your question.

277
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,470
It's your turn.

278
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:46,685
Why are you asking me… about my gender?

279
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:54,193
Someone suggested that
the reason why Dad is mad at you

280
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:56,111
is because…

281
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:58,697
you and Basil had a relationship.

282
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,952
Who is that?

283
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,080
Just forget it.

284
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,499
There's just some malicious people

285
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,835
who give meaning to everything they see.

286
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,921
I'm sorry.

287
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,221
If I ever come across that man again,

288
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:23,347
I will beat him to death.

289
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,807
Francis, that's enough. Calm down.

290
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:27,226
Francis?

291
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,310
Sam.

292
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,105
Who did your brother fight with?

293
00:20:32,189 --> 00:20:34,191
Sam, just keep it. Mother, it's nothing.

294
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,609
What do you mean nothing?

295
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,860
Just because you're adults now,

296
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,862
it doesn't mean I'll stop being a mother.

297
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:40,322
Admit it.

298
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,032
Tell me what happened.

299
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,827
We bumped into someone
at the grocery store.

300
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,497
He said…

301
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,833
that he is the husband of Dad's mistress.

302
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,759
I've received the CCTV footage I requested

303
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:04,012
outside the Palacios Estate
while it was still burning.

304
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,223
Good thing that was recovered.

305
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,433
Yes, my technician just took so long,

306
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,269
but what's important is it was recovered.

307
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,062
Watch this.

308
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:16,650
This was the exact time
that the Palacios Estate was on fire.

309
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,915
Look. He was running away
from the Palacios Estate.

310
00:21:31,999 --> 00:21:33,875
Could it be that he was
the one who burned the estate?

311
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,086
To destroy all the pieces of evidence?

312
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,254
That's possible.

313
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,631
Do you have an idea who he is?

314
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:42,801
None, Sarge.

315
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:43,802
It's okay.

316
00:21:44,594 --> 00:21:47,806
At least we have
an identifying mark. It's the jacket.

317
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:50,892
Once we figure out who owns this jacket,

318
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:54,646
we will know who the Palacios killer is.

319
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,650
Mother, that's not true, right?

320
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:00,736
No.

321
00:22:00,819 --> 00:22:02,362
Your father was kind.

322
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:06,116
A few of
his patients' husbands got jealous of him

323
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:08,368
because he was kind.

324
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,829
That's right, Mother. That man is crazy.

325
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:13,582
He called Dad Dr. Orly, <i>"Mi Amore".</i>

326
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,917
Get out of here.

327
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,794
Traitor. Cheater.

328
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:18,795
Mercy, forgive me.

329
00:22:18,879 --> 00:22:20,255
This was the first time
I became happy again.

330
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:24,885
Go and be with your <i>"Mi Amore"</i> in hell.

331
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,678
Traitors.

332
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,222
<i>Mi Amore?</i>

333
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,699
I did it.

334
00:22:48,325 --> 00:22:50,660
I finally did it, <i>Mi Amore.</i>

335
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,454
Did what?

336
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,917
I left my family.

337
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,670
Why?

338
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:03,965
Isn't this what you wanted?

339
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:05,801
You said you don't want
to be called a mistress.

340
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,135
This is it.

341
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,428
I'm giving you your wish.

342
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,351
Abandoning your family

343
00:23:14,434 --> 00:23:17,354
does not make you a single man, Orly.

344
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,316
Mother…

345
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:23,944
is <i>Mi Amore</i> familiar to you?

346
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:26,947
No, Sam. That's nothing.

347
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,365
Mother…

348
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:32,160
Mother, I know you're hiding
something from us.

349
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:36,915
You told me
that Dad had a mistress before.

350
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,375
Was that <i>Mi Amore?</i>

351
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,418
I don't know.

352
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:42,796
I didn't meet your father's mistress,

353
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:47,801
but he almost left us for that woman.

354
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,850
- Does your family know that I am the…
- Not yet.

355
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,061
I'm still looking
for the right time to introduce you.

356
00:24:01,189 --> 00:24:02,732
They will accept us.

357
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:04,734
They are old enough.

358
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:08,697
Francis, my youngest.

359
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,866
he'll soon be finished with ComSci.

360
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:12,784
They will understand us.

361
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,162
But, not Paco.

362
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,540
My only son will go amok

363
00:24:18,623 --> 00:24:20,542
if he finds out about us.

364
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,172
Dad would leave us?

365
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,261
Your father told me before

366
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,431
he was leaving us…

367
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,976
and he was going with his mistress.

368
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,316
You said you love me.

369
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:48,570
And you believed that, Orly?

370
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:52,240
You expected that I'd stand by
for someone like you?

371
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,367
You expected that I'd marry
someone like you?

372
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:56,536
Oh, come on, Orly.

373
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,787
God.

374
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:03,627
He replaced us with that woman.

375
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,712
No…

376
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,673
Father was not like that. He loved us.

377
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,925
He loved his children.

378
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,635
He would not do that, Mother.

379
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:14,387
That's why I couldn't tell you.

380
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,556
I didn't want…

381
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,726
I didn't want you to think
that your father is a bad person.

382
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:22,354
I didn't want
to destroy his good memories.

383
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,189
Dad is such a jerk.

384
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,524
Francis, that's what
I didn't want to happen,

385
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,193
that you'd get mad at him.

386
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,570
Who?

387
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,365
Who is the woman?

388
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,562
Our problem with Sam is already solved.

389
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:08,483
Our guy already faced Sam.

390
00:26:09,484 --> 00:26:11,653
It seems like Sam believed…

391
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:14,155
that it was the wife
of our staff who Dr. Orly

392
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:15,240
had a relationship with.

393
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,871
If Auntie Sam and Auntie George
are out to hurt each other,

394
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:24,582
well, they are just doing
the killer a favor.

395
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,252
It's not George who put the oil.

396
00:26:27,335 --> 00:26:29,796
And it wasn't Sam who placed
the Rubik's cube

397
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,589
so George would slip.

398
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,220
Could it be that
it was the killer who did that?

399
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,889
That's what I thought.

400
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:43,476
I have no idea
who your father's mistress is.

401
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,854
I never…

402
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,231
confronted Orly.

403
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,899
Mother, you're the wife.

404
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:52,944
If you felt something,
you should've asked Dad.

405
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,697
You had a right to confront him.

406
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,283
I thought…

407
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:00,493
it wouldn't last.

408
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,496
That your father was just tired. And…

409
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,959
he was just sad and got tempted.

410
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:13,173
Sir, delivery for Aurora Palacios.

411
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,175
I'll just check, ma'am.

412
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,345
Ma'am, there's no schedule for today.

413
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:21,097
But, just a second, ma'am.
I'll just double-check.

414
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,393
Hello?

415
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:30,732
Rojas, do we have a delivery today?

416
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,020
- Ward, Ward, Ward…
- Yes?

417
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,230
That woman.

418
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:14,067
She's the one I saw
by the window that night.

419
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,902
By Bev's window.

420
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,821
She's the killer.

421
00:28:17,904 --> 00:28:19,781
She killed Beverly.

422
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,704
But, I didn't expect
that it would reach the point

423
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,624
that he'd abandon his family.

424
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,669
So, that's how much he loved his mistress.

425
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:34,212
He would replace us?

426
00:28:36,089 --> 00:28:37,257
When was this?

427
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,426
When did this happen, Mother?

428
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:44,222
A week before he died.

429
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,642
Are you sure?

430
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:48,560
Yes, Ward.

431
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,145
I can't be wrong.

432
00:28:50,228 --> 00:28:51,938
She's the woman by the window.

433
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,232
She's the one who stabbed Beverly.

434
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,234
- Hey.
- What?

435
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,902
She might hurt you.

436
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,946
If she's the killer, it's dangerous.

437
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:06,578
I didn't inform you
that we got separated because…

438
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:12,417
before I could tell you the truth,

439
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,462
your father died.

440
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,173
I didn't want…

441
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,885
to destroy your good memories of him.

442
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,597
This happened

443
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,891
and then father died from an overdose.

444
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,934
Could it be that the woman is connected

445
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,644
to father's death?

446
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,354
He deserves that

447
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,690
because he's a cheater. That's his karma.

448
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:37,275
Good thing he died.

449
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,068
Francis…

450
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:44,699
Ward…

451
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,034
Sofia?

452
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,535
What are you doing here?

453
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,622
Jericho, the woman at the staff entrance.

454
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:55,210
It was she who killed Beverly.

455
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,337
Okay, copy.

456
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,508
I'm in a hurry.

457
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,385
Ma'am, there's no
scheduled delivery today.

458
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,638
This is a rush.

459
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,474
Your boss asked me to deliver it.

460
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:11,059
Even if you come with me inside.

461
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,195
Francis…

462
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:25,114
don't talk that way.

463
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,533
He is still your father.

464
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,868
Mother, I don't have
a father who is a cheater.

465
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:30,620
He has hurt you, Mother.

466
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:32,872
Why didn't you tell us, Mother,

467
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:36,626
that Dad left us already?

468
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,545
Yes, Mother, why didn't you tell us?

469
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,380
We looked like fools.

470
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,215
What kind of father is he?

471
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,300
Francis…

472
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,642
Sam…

473
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,942
Francis…

474
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:02,235
- You're a cheater, Dad.
- Francis.

475
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,028
You're a cheater. You're a cheater.

476
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:06,114
Francis, stop that.
You will only hurt yourself.

477
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,283
What's wrong with you? Stop it.

478
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,659
Stop it.

479
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,743
Sam…

480
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,745
leave me alone first.

481
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,123
No, I won't let you hurt yourself.

482
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:16,583
Stop it.

483
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:17,834
Stop it, Francis.

484
00:31:17,917 --> 00:31:20,003
Do you think I'm not hurting

485
00:31:20,086 --> 00:31:21,296
with what I found out about Dad?

486
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:23,798
I'm also hurt, but that's enough.

487
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:28,553
There are important things
that we need to face.

488
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,431
Go inside first.

489
00:31:31,514 --> 00:31:33,600
Don't come out until it's safe.

490
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,685
- Let's go.
- Go ahead. Go in.

491
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:45,904
Hello.

492
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:47,739
Hello, sir.

493
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:48,865
This is Jericho.

494
00:31:48,948 --> 00:31:50,408
<i>There's a woman there, right?</i>

495
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,285
- Yes, sir.
<i>- Listen to me.</i>

496
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,495
Don't be obvious.

497
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:55,872
That woman is a criminal.

498
00:31:55,955 --> 00:31:57,665
<i>Don't let her go.</i>

499
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:00,043
<i>I'll ask Sergeant Royales to come.</i>

500
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,085
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

501
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,171
Okay.

502
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:08,092
I'm not as tough as you.

503
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:12,972
We need to go back to the grocery store.

504
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,391
We need to go back to the man there.

505
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,809
Maybe someone knows him.

506
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:19,354
We need to know who that woman is.

507
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,315
Why? What for?

508
00:32:23,358 --> 00:32:24,734
She needs to tell us

509
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:27,028
why she had an affair with Dad.

510
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,490
Why Dad would leave us for her.

511
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:32,951
Why Dad committed suicide…

512
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,745
Why Dad was killed.

513
00:32:40,166 --> 00:32:41,542
Dad.

514
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:45,296
Dad, Beverly's killer is here.

515
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:47,131
What?

516
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:49,842
- Where?
- By the staff entrance.

517
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,178
Jericho said he'll take care
of the killer.

518
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,222
Ma'am, have a seat first.

519
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,473
We need to double-check something.

520
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,482
Just stay there.

521
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:09,320
Ouch.

522
00:33:10,738 --> 00:33:12,240
Are you okay?

523
00:33:16,202 --> 00:33:17,787
Who is the killer, Ward?

524
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,038
I don't know, Mom.

525
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,582
Is the killer from the estate?
A maid, cook, or what?

526
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,292
Auntie, we really don't know.

527
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,336
This is the second time I've seen her.

528
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,714
The first time was
when she killed Beverly.

529
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,675
Who is she?

530
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:33,594
Why did she kill Beverly?

531
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,805
Why is she killing my family?

532
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:37,724
She hasn't gone far.

533
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,017
Call all the guards.

534
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,476
Keep an eye on all the entrances.

535
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,728
We'll put the mansion on lockdown.

536
00:33:41,811 --> 00:33:43,646
No one can come in or go out.

537
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,857
That woman shouldn't hurt any Palacioses.

538
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,066
Okay, Boss.

539
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:50,611
Vic. Vic.

540
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:52,697
Secure the mansion.

541
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,699
No one must go out. Secured.

542
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,784
Ma'am, are you leaving?

543
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:57,994
The entire compound is on lockdown.

544
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,287
You're not allowed to go out.

545
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,248
Why is it on a lockdown?

546
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:04,083
It's not yet clear to us why,

547
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,960
but the orders came from Jericho.

548
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,671
We don't care about the lockdown.

549
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,174
My brother and I are leaving.

550
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,342
We need to fix a lot of things.

551
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,969
Let's go.

552
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,352
Sergeant Royales' group is on the way.

553
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:24,937
There are assigned guards here

554
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:26,272
and at Auntie Aurora's house too.

555
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:28,733
How about the killer? Where is she?

556
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,652
Someone is looking for her.

557
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,030
We're not sure if she escaped already,

558
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:36,282
but there's a possibility
that she's still here

559
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:39,494
in the compound hiding
and waiting to attack again.

560
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:43,247
Sofia, don't leave the house.

561
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,416
Don't leave of my sight.

562
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,087
No one should leave
while it's still unsafe.

563
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,090
The killer almost entered our compound.

564
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,966
We don't know when she'll attack again.

565
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,803
Sir Galvan. Sir Galvan.

566
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,638
George is not here.

567
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,556
Where the hell is she?

568
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,933
For you.

569
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,314
Why are you giving me flowers?

570
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:14,153
Why do men give flowers?

571
00:35:14,821 --> 00:35:16,864
To show their appreciation.

572
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:22,036
To tell a woman how important she is.

573
00:35:26,624 --> 00:35:29,252
You shouldn't have gone
out of your way. Oh, you.

574
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,589
It's enough for me
that you're a good friend.

575
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:35,508
But, what if…

576
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:40,096
I want us to be more than friends?

577
00:35:44,892 --> 00:35:46,477
But…

578
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:48,271
But, before you say something…

579
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:52,650
I want you to know

580
00:35:52,733 --> 00:35:55,111
that I understand your situation.

581
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:57,321
Basil is my best friend.

582
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:00,867
Basil just died.

583
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:02,493
And…

584
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,329
your father-in-law doesn't like me.

585
00:36:06,497 --> 00:36:08,499
And I'm having a baby.

586
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,049
Sam, wait.

587
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:19,969
Be careful.

588
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:25,016
Sam, I'll go around the parking,

589
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:27,143
and you talk to the grocery staff.

590
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,313
Maybe they will recognize
the man we're looking for.

591
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,075
What's taking Vivian so long? Call her.

592
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,494
- Yes, sir.
- Hurry.

593
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,580
Vivian.

594
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:49,040
Yes. Yes.

595
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,292
- What?
- I'm coming…

596
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:53,586
Wait.

597
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:57,131
Galvan, I looked for it in your office.

598
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,382
It's really not there.

599
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:00,051
It's impossible for my gun
not to be there.

600
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:02,011
That's where I kept it.

601
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,305
Maybe it's in the room.

602
00:37:04,388 --> 00:37:06,140
Where did you last use it or keep it?

603
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:08,851
It can't be missing there.

604
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,603
I need my gun.

605
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,940
Can you take care of someone else's child?

606
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:15,524
Of course.

607
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,694
That's Basil's baby too.

608
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:23,157
I will treat your baby as my own.

609
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,498
Iñigo, I'll be honest with you.

610
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,168
I'm not yet ready.

611
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:39,215
Have you seen a man in red

612
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:41,384
and he's this tall?

613
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,927
- No.
- None?

614
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,595
Okay, thank you.

615
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,185
Sir, didn't you see a man this tall?

616
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:54,272
And he is wearing a red shirt.

617
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:57,400
I didn't notice, ma'am.

618
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,194
Thank you.

619
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:01,529
Sam.

620
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,655
- What?
- Sam, I can't find him.

621
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:04,031
I really couldn't find him.

622
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:14,292
That's Ms. Belen.
I think that's Ms. Belen.

623
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,209
Ms. Belen.

624
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:19,088
Ms. Belen, wait.

625
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:20,840
Ms. Belen…

626
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,259
- Wait.
- The entire place

627
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,720
is full of guards.
There are guards everywhere.

628
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,555
And the whole mansion is on lockdown.

629
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,515
That's my protection.

630
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,351
I need that gun.

631
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,229
Damn these legs.

632
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,901
Why did this happen?

633
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:44,363
How can I find the killer?

634
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,074
How can I give my family protection?

635
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,538
Galvan…

636
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:55,499
I am here now.

637
00:38:57,752 --> 00:39:00,588
I will protect you for now.

638
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,693
I am thankful

639
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,155
because when Basil died,
you became my friend.

640
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:32,578
But, if I'm going
to be fair to you, I admit…

641
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,998
I can't repay your love.

642
00:39:40,753 --> 00:39:41,837
- Ms. Belen, wait.
- Ms. Belen.

643
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:42,838
Ms. Belen.

644
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,256
- Ms. Belen.
- We just want to ask something.

645
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,841
- Wait, Ms. Belen.
- Please.

646
00:39:45,925 --> 00:39:48,219
Why did you suddenly leave the house?

647
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,805
Ma'am, I'm sorry,

648
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:53,974
but I can't talk to you anymore.

649
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,102
Who told you that? Amando?

650
00:39:58,020 --> 00:39:59,438
Why?

651
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:01,941
Do you know anything
that we shouldn't know?

652
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:04,110
They will get mad.

653
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:06,112
Ms. Belen, who will get mad?

654
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,738
Is it Sir Amando? Who?

655
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:10,783
Is this about my father's mistress?

656
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,494
Do you know about it?

657
00:40:18,999 --> 00:40:21,043
My mother told us that my father

658
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:23,003
had a mistress.

659
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,466
But, do you know who is his mistress?

660
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:36,350
George, I'm not in a hurry.

661
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:40,020
You don't have to say yes now.

662
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:43,149
I just want you to know…

663
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:46,152
how important you are to me.

664
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:51,657
And… I'm always here for you.

665
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:57,538
Whenever you need anything and…

666
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:01,876
I mean…

667
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:03,961
Excuse me. I have to answer.

668
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:09,925
Hello, Mom. Why?

669
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:12,678
What?

670
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:17,016
Beverly's killer is
in the ancestral house.

671
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,226
She pretended to be a delivery girl.

672
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,567
Just ask them.

673
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:29,862
Please don't involve me.

674
00:41:29,945 --> 00:41:31,614
Ms. Belen…

675
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:34,867
my father helped you when you needed help.

676
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:40,331
Maybe now you can help us, his children.

677
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,838
Just ask Ma'am Aurora.

678
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:50,466
Why Mom Aurora?

679
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:53,427
It's because…

680
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,097
she had a relationship with Dr. Orly.

681
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:05,105
Ma'am Aurora had an affair
with your father.

682
00:42:13,989 --> 00:42:14,990
<i>Let's help her.</i>

683
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,408
<i>No, George. Look at her.</i>

684
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:17,826
Didn't you tell me

685
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,370
<i>that the killer went to your house</i>

686
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:21,038
<i>and pretended to be a delivery girl?</i>

687
00:42:21,121 --> 00:42:22,831
<i>George, stay here. Lock the door.</i>

688
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,625
The whole surrounding is secured, madam.

689
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:26,794
My priority is Sam's safety.

690
00:42:26,877 --> 00:42:28,754
I'm calling her, but she's not answering.

691
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:29,672
Did they go out?

692
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:32,091
They want to find out
who their father's mistress is.

693
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:33,676
Sam, father's mistress
became your mother-in-law?

694
00:42:33,759 --> 00:42:36,720
Your husband had a mistress,
took drugs, and died.

695
00:42:36,804 --> 00:42:38,389
What's so hard to understand about that?

696
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:41,141
<i>She even gave Dr. Orly a watch</i>

697
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,226
<i>that matched hers.</i>

698
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:43,811
Everyone is troubled here.

699
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,312
It's scary to go out.

700
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,564
What's scarier,

701
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:48,732
if the killer stabs you up-front

702
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:49,733
or if the person you treated is family

703
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:51,902
stabs you?
