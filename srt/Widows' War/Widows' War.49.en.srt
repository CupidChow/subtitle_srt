1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,391
Why are you killing the Palacios?

2
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,351
Because they are monsters.

3
00:00:18,435 --> 00:00:19,853
<i>Lord…</i>

4
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:23,523
<i>I'm begging you.</i>

5
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:26,693
<i>Please save Francis.</i>

6
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,486
What are you smiling about?

7
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,865
Are you happy
with what happened to Francis?

8
00:00:31,948 --> 00:00:33,658
Of course not.

9
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,993
PREVIOUSLY

10
00:00:35,076 --> 00:00:37,370
Maybe it's you who is happy, Aurora.

11
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:40,290
I am not Iñigo Morales.

12
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:44,794
My name is Antonio Beringuela.

13
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,589
What's that supposed to mean, Vivian?

14
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,508
You malicious gold digger.

15
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,887
Doc, what do we need to do?

16
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,223
Right now, the best thing to do is…

17
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,184
<i>be there for him.</i>

18
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:00,935
<i>Stay positive.</i>

19
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:02,604
<i>Basil was a good man!</i>

20
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:03,688
No.

21
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:06,191
Basil was as evil as his father.

22
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:08,526
Sam was telling the truth.

23
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:11,279
Basil ordered her…

24
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:14,741
to kill you because he found out
you can't have children.

25
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,242
No!

26
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:17,535
That's not true!

27
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:19,412
It is the truth!

28
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:23,917
Evil is flowing in the blood
of the Palacios.

29
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:28,505
Basil admitted to me before

30
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:31,216
that being crazy is in their genes.

31
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,676
It has something to do with the gold dust

32
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,470
that they inhale.

33
00:01:35,553 --> 00:01:38,431
That's why Juliet and I pushed through
with our plans…

34
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:39,933
to kill them,

35
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:43,937
and we won't leave anyone behind.

36
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,316
Francis, you can do this.

37
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,193
Please, fight.

38
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:51,694
Francis, my dear.

39
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:55,115
Francis. Francis.

40
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,413
Nurse! Nurse!

41
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,963
Nurse! Nurse!

42
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:11,631
Nurse!

43
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:21,808
But I met you…

44
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,189
And I loved you.

45
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:35,446
I don't want to push through
with the plan.

46
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:38,950
All I wanted to do was to protect you…

47
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,411
and your baby.

48
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,546
Francis… Francis…

49
00:02:55,174 --> 00:02:57,176
Ma'am, excuse me. Ma'am, excuse me.

50
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,595
Mom, Mom.

51
00:03:06,644 --> 00:03:08,438
- Francis!
- No! No! No! No!

52
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:09,522
- Francis!
- Francis!

53
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:12,191
Francis!

54
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:15,695
- Francis, my dear! Francis!
- Francis!

55
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:17,739
Francis!

56
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,241
- Francis! Francis!
- Francis!

57
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,119
- Francis!
- Francis! Francis, my dear!

58
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,290
George, I love you…

59
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,962
And I've never felt anything
like this before.

60
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,969
I hope you find it in your heart
to forgive me…

61
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,139
and learn to love me.

62
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:47,268
No, Iñigo.

63
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,814
I can't love a murderer.

64
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:56,069
I would rather die…

65
00:03:57,153 --> 00:04:00,615
than love a monster like you.

66
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,493
Francis…

67
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,203
Francis…

68
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,083
Francis, my son…

69
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,883
Francis!

70
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:22,220
My God…

71
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:28,559
Please…

72
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,040
I will not force you.

73
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,377
I know you can't accept me.

74
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,213
I'm a monster.

75
00:04:58,381 --> 00:05:00,049
But please remember this.

76
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,510
This monster…

77
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,013
is deeply in love with you.

78
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,350
George, I hope you can forgive me
for what I did to you…

79
00:05:10,435 --> 00:05:11,602
and to your baby.

80
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:16,816
I love you.

81
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:26,784
Asystole.

82
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:28,161
Another defib.

83
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,420
Charge 250 joules.

84
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:42,050
- Everybody clear?
- Yes, Doc.

85
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,177
One, two, three.

86
00:06:01,444 --> 00:06:04,363
I would rather die…

87
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:08,159
than love a monster like you.

88
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,090
Continue CPR.

89
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,132
Keep bagging.

90
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,971
Third epinephrine, Doc.

91
00:06:29,055 --> 00:06:30,264
Rhythm check.

92
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:31,641
Okay.

93
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:34,268
Asystole.

94
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,436
Continue CPR.

95
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,921
George…

96
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:04,882
I almost shot you.

97
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,511
Why are you following me?

98
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,430
Because we're not done yet.

99
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,723
There's still something
I need to know from you.

100
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,476
We have nothing more to talk about.

101
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:18,396
Iñigo. Iñigo.

102
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,356
I need to know something from you.

103
00:07:21,065 --> 00:07:22,066
What?

104
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:25,528
Have you known Sam for a long time?

105
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:28,197
Are you her accomplice in poisoning Basil?

106
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,574
What?

107
00:07:30,074 --> 00:07:31,117
No.

108
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,120
Then why did you use Francis' morphine?

109
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:36,330
How did you have access?

110
00:07:41,836 --> 00:07:45,089
Unfortunately, we still
haven't revived the patient.

111
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,968
There's still no heartbeat or respiration.

112
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,720
Doc, help my brother.

113
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,847
Help my brother, please.

114
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,599
Will we still continue CPR?

115
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:58,144
Please bring my son back to life.

116
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,730
Continue CPR.

117
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:01,981
Keep bagging.

118
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:09,447
George, what I mean is,

119
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,908
I didn't poison Basil.

120
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,660
Juliet and I only wanted to kill

121
00:08:14,744 --> 00:08:17,038
Peter and Beverly.

122
00:08:17,705 --> 00:08:20,458
But when I killed Peter,

123
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,251
I thought he was a Palacios. My mistake.

124
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,170
But believe me.

125
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,298
I didn't kill Basil.

126
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:29,884
Someone else did it.

127
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:34,347
If it wasn't you, then who?

128
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,806
Seventh epi given, Doc.

129
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,726
VTAC.

130
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,269
Defib tayo.

131
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,275
Charge 300 joules.

132
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,238
Everybody clear?

133
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,447
Yes, Doc.

134
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,990
One, two, three.

135
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:57,537
I wanted to kill Basil…

136
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:02,124
But someone got ahead of me.

137
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,211
It's the mastermind.

138
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:07,171
Mastermind?

139
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:09,131
Who is the mastermind?

140
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,842
There's a mastermind for all the killings?

141
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:14,845
Someone is giving you orders?
I thought it was just you and Juliet.

142
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:18,349
There is a mastermind, okay?

143
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,103
It was he who told me
to kill all the Palacios.

144
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,814
Who is the mastermind, Iñigo?

145
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,856
Who?

146
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:47,878
Asystole.

147
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:49,755
Time of death?

148
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:53,509
1:45, Doc.

149
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:09,877
Help!

150
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,088
- Help us!
- Ms. Georgina!

151
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,130
- Sarge.
- Miss Georgina.

152
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:15,383
- Sergeant Royales, Jerico!
- Miss Georgina.

153
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:17,051
Someone shot Iñigo.

154
00:11:17,551 --> 00:11:19,011
Did you see who shot him?

155
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:21,514
He was in a black car and went over there.

156
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:23,182
Ask me later.

157
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:25,434
Let's take him to the hospital.

158
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:28,187
Francis…

159
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:32,024
I'm so sorry, Sam.

160
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,778
We've given him
the last dose of epinephrine,

161
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:38,155
but there was no response.

162
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,740
- Sorry for your loss.
- Doc!

163
00:11:39,824 --> 00:11:41,867
- No!
- Condolences.

164
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,620
No! No…

165
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,249
Francis…

166
00:11:48,332 --> 00:11:50,084
No… No…

167
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,961
Francis…

168
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:53,879
Francis, my dear.

169
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,923
Francis, my son.

170
00:11:56,924 --> 00:12:00,136
Team, please proceed near
the entrance of the property.

171
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:02,221
Now! Move it!

172
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,440
Inigo, wait!

173
00:12:15,526 --> 00:12:17,319
Francis, my son…

174
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:20,948
Francis…

175
00:12:23,159 --> 00:12:24,660
Francis, my son…

176
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:28,914
Francis, don't leave us.

177
00:12:37,798 --> 00:12:40,885
No…

178
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,472
Francis, no.

179
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,557
Francis, my son.

180
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,393
Jericho, may I borrow your cellphone?

181
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,617
- <i>Mom.</i>
- George?

182
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,368
Thank God!

183
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,037
How are you?

184
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,997
Did Iñigo hurt you?

185
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,125
Mom, I'm okay. Don't worry about me.

186
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,211
Oh my, thank you, Lord.

187
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,171
Thank you so much.

188
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:18,422
Thank you!

189
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:21,383
Team Alpha, Team Bravo, location, please?

190
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:25,346
Why is it noisy there? Where are you?

191
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:28,307
<i>We're waiting for the ambulance.</i>

192
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,852
Mom, someone shot Iñigo.
We're taking him to the hospital.

193
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:36,899
Why are you going to the hospital?
Why do you have to save that killer?

194
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,442
Mom!

195
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:40,027
That killer must die

196
00:13:40,110 --> 00:13:42,655
so the killings will end
here in the Palacios.

197
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:49,578
George, I'll call you later.

198
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,372
Go home.

199
00:13:51,455 --> 00:13:53,457
Don't go to the hospital.

200
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,716
Who's there?

201
00:14:04,843 --> 00:14:06,136
Ward?

202
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,567
Ward?

203
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:23,779
Ward?

204
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:20,753
I think Sir Galvan…

205
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,630
is going crazy.

206
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,049
Earlier he was screaming,

207
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,842
now, he is laughing.

208
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:02,002
Sam? Mercy? How is Francis?

209
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:05,756
He is gone.

210
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,716
What?

211
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,642
Sir Galvan can stand already?

212
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,693
Why is he still pretending
that he can't walk?

213
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,079
Sam…

214
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:41,041
Ando told me

215
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:44,670
that Mercy is the real target.

216
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,882
Because if that's the case,

217
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:51,593
I think I know who did it.

218
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:57,349
I am not sure.

219
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:01,895
But I think it's Aurora.

220
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,028
And you, Mercy, be ready.

221
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,655
You will pay for what you did to me.

222
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:15,367
Why? What will you do?

223
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,793
Sam…

224
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,881
Is it true?

225
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,175
Francis is dead?

226
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:34,762
I'm sorry, Sam.

227
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:38,432
My condolences, Mercy.

228
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,855
You killed my brother.

229
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,733
You killed Francis!

230
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,204
What?

231
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,540
Why would I kill your brother?

232
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,835
You wanted to have Mother run over,

233
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:51,630
but Francis saved her. That's why he died!

234
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:55,259
I didn't run Francis or your mother over.

235
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,053
Have you ever seen me drive, Sam?

236
00:18:58,137 --> 00:18:59,638
I don't know.

237
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,223
You ordered someone.

238
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:04,268
- You hired someone.
- No, Samantha!

239
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:06,979
I have nothing to do with
what happened to Francis.

240
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,899
And stop making a habit
of pointing your finger at me!

241
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,110
I didn't kill your brother!

242
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:16,488
Iñigo…

243
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:19,741
Iñigo, we'll take you to the hospital.
The police car is on its way.

244
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:21,243
Men, hurry.

245
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,203
We need to take the suspect
to the hospital

246
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,872
- Inigo…
- Go.

247
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,832
Iñigo, who is the mastermind?

248
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:29,418
Iñigo, say it!

249
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,962
Who?

250
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:34,840
You're a liar.

251
00:19:34,923 --> 00:19:37,050
You killed my brother!

252
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,719
- Let go of me!
- Animal!

253
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,679
- You fool!
- How dare you!

254
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,097
You fool!

255
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:45,350
- Stop it, Sam! That's enough!
- What's with you?

256
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,813
Aren't you thinking, you idiot?

257
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:53,942
I talked to your bodyguard.

258
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:59,489
You said it was the Palacios killer
who ran Francis over.

259
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,950
The same masked man who attacked George!

260
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,952
You were the person behind the mask!

261
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,038
You are the Palacios killer!

262
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:09,833
The Palacios Killer kills a Palacios!

263
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:14,254
Why would I kill my own blood?

264
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,007
Because you only want you
and your grandchild

265
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:18,717
to be the remaining Palacios!

266
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,636
That's what you want.

267
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:23,722
Iñigo, who is the mastermind?

268
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:25,807
- Iñigo!
- Jericho, please.

269
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,893
It's just right for Jericho to ask

270
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,020
as long as Attorney can still talk.

271
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:32,439
Who is the mastermind?

272
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,776
Attorney Morales, who is the mastermind?

273
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:40,155
Iñigo, please don't give up on us. Please!

274
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,076
Iñigo…

275
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,371
Who, Iñigo? Who is the mastermind?

276
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:50,582
Who poisoned Basil?

277
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,542
Iñigo!

278
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,796
Iñigo, please, don't die.

279
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,507
Iñigo!

280
00:20:59,216 --> 00:21:01,134
- Iñigo!
- Iñigo, please!

281
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:04,554
Why would I kill Francis?

282
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:07,391
He's a Castillo not a Palacios.

283
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:09,142
You wanted to kill my mother

284
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,978
but Francis stepped in the way,

285
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,312
that's why he died.

286
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:16,692
And you will not stop
until you kill all my loved ones.

287
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:18,944
And you will kill me after I give birth.

288
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,282
Let's go! Let's go, hurry!

289
00:21:34,626 --> 00:21:35,711
What?

290
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,754
You're an animal!

291
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,506
Sam, stop it.

292
00:21:39,589 --> 00:21:42,009
You're so evil. Animal.

293
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:46,888
Animal. You're so evil. You're so evil.

294
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,725
You're so evil.

295
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,822
Francis…

296
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:09,328
George, we were so worried about you.

297
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,166
Good thing you're already home.

298
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:20,005
I don't care about any wealth, George.

299
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,424
You and Ward are
the only important things to me.

300
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,844
If you want us to leave this place,
I won't object anymore.

301
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,055
What's important

302
00:22:28,138 --> 00:22:31,224
is you're all safe
and won't be in trouble.

303
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,732
Bea, Beatrice, calm down.

304
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:42,319
You are the emergency contact
of Attorney Morales.

305
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:43,487
That's why I called you.

306
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:46,114
He no longer has an immediate family?

307
00:22:47,365 --> 00:22:48,825
I see.

308
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,286
So you're the person
I'll talk to moving forward.

309
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:56,041
His remains are currently
in police custody for autopsy.

310
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,376
Okay, bye.

311
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:00,128
George…

312
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,380
Thank God you're back.

313
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,802
Cairo, help me stand up.

314
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,906
Let me see your pictures
of the tire marks.

315
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:29,825
Here, Sarge.

316
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,621
Wide tread.

317
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:37,999
It's possible that it's a sports car
or it could also be a sedan.

318
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,671
The indentation is deep.

319
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:43,672
He's in a hurry.

320
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:47,217
Send this to the crime lab immediately

321
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:50,178
so they can cross-match
with the database of the forensics.

322
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:52,180
- Yes, Sir.
- Okay.

323
00:23:58,770 --> 00:24:00,772
I got so worried about you.

324
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,536
I called Royales.

325
00:24:15,912 --> 00:24:17,205
So, Iñigo's dead.

326
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:21,209
Good.

327
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,253
Juliet is in prison.

328
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,964
There's no more Palacios killer.

329
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:27,257
We're all safe.

330
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,051
And Basil…

331
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:33,054
got the justice he deserves.

332
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,267
Dad, it wasn't Iñigo or Juliet
who poisoned Basil.

333
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:41,688
And they are not the only
Palacios killers.

334
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:43,690
What?

335
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,901
What do you mean?

336
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,657
- Jericho?
- Sarge.

337
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:55,827
They saw this in the crime scene.

338
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,206
It's Attorney Morales' cellphone.

339
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,625
There's no password.
That's how they accessed it.

340
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:02,918
There are no messages.

341
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:05,921
But there's a recurring call
from one number.

342
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:09,424
Yesterday, last night,
and one hour before he was shot.

343
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,135
That could determine who the shooter is.

344
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,887
File a court order right away

345
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:17,057
to request the Telco provider
for call tracing.

346
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,725
- Okay, Sarge.
- Okay.

347
00:25:23,521 --> 00:25:26,316
Iñigo said before he died

348
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,778
that there is a mastermind.

349
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:33,657
That jerk just made that up.

350
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,618
What mastermind? Who?

351
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:40,997
Maybe the same person who shot him dead?

352
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:51,132
Dad, go back
to all the people you have oppressed.

353
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,134
Just like…

354
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,763
José Beringuela.

355
00:25:57,847 --> 00:26:00,392
Maybe that could lead you
to the mastermind.

356
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,061
José Beringuela?

357
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:05,647
I don't know him.

358
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,649
Are you sure, Dad?

359
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,651
He is the father of Iñigo…

360
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,280
Antonio Beringuela,

361
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,950
who you and Auntie Aurora
ordered to be killed.

362
00:26:17,033 --> 00:26:18,493
Ordered to be killed?

363
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,799
Mother…

364
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,013
Do you want Francis to wear this?

365
00:26:50,942 --> 00:26:53,445
Impossible. I've only used
five tablets from the lot.

366
00:26:54,654 --> 00:26:57,532
Mr. Castillo, you need to come with us.

367
00:26:57,615 --> 00:27:00,327
Sir, I really have nothing to do
with this.

368
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,454
Sir, I'm telling the truth.

369
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,496
I am innocent.

370
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,832
Francis, please forgive me.

371
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,251
I didn't know what to do that night.

372
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,711
Basil was threatening me.

373
00:27:10,462 --> 00:27:12,464
So even if it got me in trouble,

374
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,924
you still used my morphine?

375
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,426
I'm sorry.

376
00:27:16,509 --> 00:27:19,179
Did you know that Sam was almost in danger

377
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,056
while looking for you?

378
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,350
What?

379
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,936
Sam, are you okay?

380
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,897
How about the baby?
How's the baby? Is the baby okay?

381
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:31,274
Sam…

382
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,818
We're okay. I'm okay.

383
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,409
I said I'll make it up to you.

384
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:46,456
Now, I can never do that.

385
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:53,213
Aurora and I didn't kill anyone.

386
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:57,300
Then why is Iñigo seeking revenge?

387
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,471
Because I stopped his plan

388
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,181
to extort money from Basil.

389
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:05,392
You're unbelievable.

390
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:08,019
That guy already kidnapped you.

391
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:10,605
You were almost in danger.
My grandchild too.

392
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:14,025
And now you believe him more?

393
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:16,027
Let me guess.

394
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:20,657
He was able to fool you
with his tears and begging?

395
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,284
Just what I thought.

396
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,745
He did the same thing with Basil.

397
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:30,834
Ma'am, Sargeant Tupaz.

398
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:32,627
Ma'am.

399
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:33,837
Thank you.

400
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,380
My condolences, Ms. Samantha.

401
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:37,465
Thank you.

402
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,678
Do you have a suspect for
who ran your brother over?

403
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:45,515
Someone who is mad
at your brother that could…

404
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,517
It's Mother.

405
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,936
Mother is their target.

406
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,522
They want to run Mother over.

407
00:28:53,106 --> 00:28:54,315
Who is mad at her?

408
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,234
My mother-in-law.

409
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,154
It's Aurora Palacios.

410
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,993
You're so gullible.

411
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:06,536
You are so easy to believe.

412
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,164
Do you know why, Dad?

413
00:29:10,331 --> 00:29:13,418
Because since becaming
a part of this family,

414
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:16,671
I've not known
who or what to believe anymore.

415
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,215
You are all hiding something!

416
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,469
You, Auntie Aurora, Paco.

417
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,679
And it's not only Iñigo who lied,

418
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,891
but Basil too. And you covered it up.

419
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,728
So now, you believe Iñigo more?

420
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,730
George…

421
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:36,191
If you want us to be allies,

422
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:40,361
don't believe the people
who are destroying the Palacios so easily

423
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:44,449
because you're also carrying
the Palacios name

424
00:29:44,532 --> 00:29:47,452
that you should be protecting.

425
00:29:47,535 --> 00:29:49,871
How can I protect the name I am carrying

426
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:53,082
if I only now find out
all the evil things you did?

427
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:55,502
Dad, you stepped on a lot of people.

428
00:29:55,585 --> 00:29:57,879
You oppressed a lot of people.
That's why a lot of people hate you.

429
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:02,467
Give me one solid proof

430
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:05,178
that those accusations are true.

431
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,013
I challenge you.

432
00:30:07,096 --> 00:30:08,932
One solid proof.

433
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:12,143
Not just stories or sob stories of others

434
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,937
to get sympathy.

435
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:16,231
Give me one solid proof!

436
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,234
What now?

437
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,528
There's nothing you can say

438
00:30:22,111 --> 00:30:26,115
because you have nothing
but the words of that jerk.

439
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,368
Who happens to be Juliet's accomplice.

440
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:30,370
They are both killers.

441
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:33,790
And yet, you choose to believe Iñigo.

442
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,551
I'm so disappointed in you.

443
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,555
Just when I started
to care about you as a daughter.

444
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,393
Cairo, let's go.

445
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:06,406
It's Sergeant Royales.

446
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,867
Hello, Sarge?

447
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:11,494
I'm now with Ms. Samantha.

448
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,413
I'll put you on loudspeaker.

449
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:19,002
Sergeant Royales, how is George?

450
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:21,087
She's safe now. We saved her.

451
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:22,881
<i>She's home now.</i>

452
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,800
<i>But Attorney Morales is dead.</i>

453
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:27,594
He was shot.

454
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,054
Who shot him?

455
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,431
<i>That's what I'm going to find out.</i>

456
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:48,364
Who is that? What's with you? Wait!

457
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:12,931
Welcome back, George.

458
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,395
You're really ungrateful.

459
00:32:20,855 --> 00:32:24,442
Do you know how much
Galvan worried about you?

460
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,778
And then what? What did you do?

461
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,531
You believed all the fake news about him.

462
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,618
Sergeant Tupaz, update on Mr. Castillo.

463
00:32:33,701 --> 00:32:35,787
Nothing concrete yet,

464
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:40,333
but eyewitnesses said that
it was a black car that ran him over.

465
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:43,252
Aside from that, we're still in the dark.

466
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:45,630
Wait… Are there tire marks?

467
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:46,798
There are skid marks.

468
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,258
I already sent the photos
to the crime lab.

469
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:51,469
Do you have a picture on your cellphone?

470
00:32:51,552 --> 00:32:54,722
Send me a copy.
I'll compare the tread pattern to the car

471
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:57,100
used by the person
who shot Attorney Morales.

472
00:32:57,684 --> 00:32:59,102
Yes, Sarge.

473
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,440
What's with you, Galvan?

474
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,901
Why did you wake me up?

475
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:09,862
It's Iñigo, Aurora.

476
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,867
He is Antonio Beringuela,

477
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:18,079
the son of José and Zenaida.

478
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:22,750
He's the kid that we couldn't find before
who we thought was dead too.

479
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,800
No wonder…

480
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:34,971
he is one of the Palacios killers.

481
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:39,600
He outsmarted us
without us knowing, Galvan.

482
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,896
But where is he now?

483
00:33:44,439 --> 00:33:45,314
Dead.

484
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:48,026
Hey, Vivian. Can you please
shut your mouth?

485
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:49,360
- Because if you don't…
- What?

486
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,029
What will you do? There's your daughter.

487
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,447
- Mom!
- What?

488
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,073
Are you fighting again?

489
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,950
Your mother won't stop.

490
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,077
Can we have a ceasefire for now?

491
00:33:58,161 --> 00:34:00,705
Let's celebrate George's return.

492
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:05,126
Let's take a moment
to grieve for the Castillos.

493
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:08,546
Why? What happened to the Castillos?

494
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,631
Didn't you know?

495
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,759
Francis is gone.

496
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,013
What happened to him?

497
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:28,608
Do you think both cases are connected?

498
00:34:28,691 --> 00:34:30,526
I will find that out.

499
00:34:31,569 --> 00:34:33,404
What Ms. Samantha said,

500
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,907
it that it was the Palacios killer
who killed her brother.

501
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:40,536
Attorney Morales said,
there's another Palacios killer.

502
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:41,871
The mastermind.

503
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,873
There's a mastermind?

504
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,376
Maybe that's Aurora Palacios.

505
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,297
She is behind all the killings here.

506
00:34:57,303 --> 00:34:59,097
Aren't you worried?

507
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:03,434
Royales might dig up what you did
to the Beringuela couple.

508
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,937
What I did?

509
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,271
What we both did it!

510
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:09,232
Aurora, I was against it.

511
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,275
But you forced me.

512
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,027
Calm down!

513
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:16,948
Galvan, José died in prison.

514
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,699
Zenaida committed suicide.

515
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,493
We have nothing to do with that.

516
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:23,704
Royales is focusing on the case.

517
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:27,125
What if he digs deeper and finds out…

518
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,335
the connection between Iñigo,

519
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:32,130
the Beringuelas, and the Palacios?

520
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,133
I already told you to calm down, Galvan!

521
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,885
We are untouchable.

522
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:41,764
Have you forgotten
the people who helped us before?

523
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:46,310
Most of them are even more powerful now.

524
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:50,231
Others became mayors. There's a judge too.

525
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:54,026
You are such a scaredy cat.

526
00:35:56,612 --> 00:35:57,572
What now?

527
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,866
Are you okay now?

528
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,035
May I go back to sleep now?

529
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:05,538
Iñigo said,

530
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:10,251
it's not only him and Juliet
who are the Palacios killer.

531
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,670
There's a mastermind.

532
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,299
A mastermind?

533
00:36:20,386 --> 00:36:25,683
Galvan, we Palacios are really in demand…

534
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:30,271
with people who want us dead.

535
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:38,112
You look unfazed, unbothered.

536
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:41,741
Aren't you surprised
that there's a mastermind?

537
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:47,371
Do you know the mastermind Iñigo mentioned
before he died?

538
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:50,333
- No!
- Is it you?

539
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:52,376
Are you the mastermind?

540
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,795
Why the hell would you think that?

541
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,048
I heard it…

542
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,010
Sam is accusing you of killing Francis.

543
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:05,556
Are you behind the mask
of the Palacios killer

544
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,266
who ran him over?

545
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,310
Or…

546
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:14,065
someone who you ordered?

547
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:19,487
Was it you who shot Iñigo?
Or did you hire someone to shoot him?

548
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,822
Damn you, Galvan!

549
00:37:22,573 --> 00:37:25,618
I have nothing to do with those murders.

550
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:29,413
You're like Samantha.

551
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,833
You think stupidly.
You ask stupid questions.

552
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:35,211
Why would I kill Francis

553
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,798
if I were a Palacios killer
or if I were the mastermind?

554
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:40,800
Why?

555
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:43,135
Is Francis a Palacios?

556
00:37:43,219 --> 00:37:47,640
I don't know what's going on
in your mind, Aurora.

557
00:37:47,723 --> 00:37:50,726
Maybe you want to wipe out
not only the Palacios,

558
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,603
but everyone around us,

559
00:37:52,687 --> 00:37:54,647
even your accomplices,

560
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,858
so that you alone will remain

561
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,404
and seize the wealth of the Palacios!

562
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,781
Stop accusing Ma'am Aurora!

563
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:05,616
Just leave, Sir Galvan.

564
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,743
Who are you to tell me that?

565
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:09,161
I am not leaving

566
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,998
until Aurora answers me.

567
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,792
- You don't want to leave?
- Let me go!

568
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:17,003
- Don't meddle with me.
- Amando!

569
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:19,005
- Animal!
- Galvan, stop it!

570
00:38:19,088 --> 00:38:21,132
What's with the both of you? Stop it!

571
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,135
What's with you?

572
00:38:24,218 --> 00:38:25,261
- You animal!
- Stop it!

573
00:38:25,344 --> 00:38:26,762
- You're just a helper here!
- Cairo!

574
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:27,805
Cairo!

575
00:38:27,888 --> 00:38:29,348
- You're just a helper!
- Take your boss out!

576
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,934
- Stop it! What's with you?
- Stop it, Sir.

577
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,644
- Stop it, Sir.
- Amando…

578
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,187
Amando…

579
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:37,982
Animal!

580
00:38:38,482 --> 00:38:39,942
You're just a helper here!

581
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:41,944
Stop it!

582
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:43,237
Get out!

583
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,531
Cairo, take your boss out!

584
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,209
Amado, are you all right?

585
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:01,756
Did Galvan hit you badly?

586
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,091
I'm okay, Madam.

587
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,885
Are you sure?

588
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,679
- Yes, Madam.
- Good.

589
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:38,250
You?

590
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,419
I thought it was my sibling.

591
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,004
What do you need?

592
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,882
Who is the mastermind, Juliet?

593
00:39:48,427 --> 00:39:49,261
I don't know.

594
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:51,013
It's impossible that you don't know.

595
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,183
It's your sister!

596
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,019
Mom…

597
00:39:57,103 --> 00:39:59,021
Mom, just sit down.

598
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:03,442
Juliet might do something to your sister.

599
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:07,071
Sergeant Royales is there.
They will take care of George.

600
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,324
I already told George not to follow.

601
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:12,993
Please, Juliet, say it.

602
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,956
I need to know who poisoned my husband.

603
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:18,749
Come on.

604
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,584
I already said I don't know.

605
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:22,253
I was also surprised

606
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:25,214
when that Attorney said
there was a mastermind.

607
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,174
But you know, that's not impossible.

608
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,510
Because of the many people
who are mad with the Palacios.

609
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,846
Most likely, Attorney
was talking to someone else.

610
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,306
You have been talking to Iñigo
for a long time.

611
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,517
That's why I don't believe you doubt

612
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,310
that he's conniving with someone else!

613
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,312
Say it, Juliet.

614
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,649
What's happening?
What's taking your sister so long?

615
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:45,901
Mom, let's just wait.

616
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,612
I said I don't know!

617
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:51,240
All I know is
they are a curse in our lives.

618
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:53,659
They are a curse to the miners!

619
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:55,828
That's why they should all die!

620
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,037
Juliet.

621
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,417
If Iñigo hadn't fallen in love with you,

622
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,461
our plans would've pushed through.

623
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:06,088
We would've continued our plan
of killing all the Palacios.

624
00:41:06,172 --> 00:41:08,090
But Iñigo was a jerk.

625
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,758
He fell for Basil,

626
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,343
and he also fell for you!

627
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:13,637
Let go of me!

628
00:41:13,721 --> 00:41:15,598
I will kill you!

629
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,516
And I will kill the baby in your womb

630
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,478
so there won't be any Palacios born!

631
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:23,439
And whoever the mastermind is,

632
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,984
I hope he succeeds in killing all of you!

633
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:29,320
From the youngest to the oldest!

634
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,410
- Who is this from?
- I intentionally sent Samantha

635
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:39,205
<i>those colorful flowers</i>
<i>so she'll be pissed off!</i>

636
00:41:39,288 --> 00:41:39,955
NEXT EPISODE

637
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:42,791
We want to ask you questions
about what happened to Mr. Castillo.

638
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:45,711
- No.
- You killed Francis.

639
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,379
You have no proof.

640
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,799
<i>Even if this family is a mess,</i>
<i>you are still my family.</i>

641
00:41:50,883 --> 00:41:53,093
As long as my family is in danger,
I will stay here.

642
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:54,512
Welcome to the family.

643
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,640
What's this? Galvan said
you can't come into his room.

644
00:41:57,723 --> 00:41:59,433
<i>Aurora, it's just the two of us</i>
<i>left in this family.</i>

645
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:02,186
The real family.
So let's be each other's ally.

646
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:04,813
Let's help each other.
Let's save this family.

647
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,315
That's the mask of the Palacios killer.

648
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,609
- Galvan, why do you have that?
- <i>Leave. One…</i>

649
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,402
Two, three.

650
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:11,695
<i>Now what?</i>

651
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,072
Tell my brother

652
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,573
that it wasn't you who killed him.

653
00:42:14,657 --> 00:42:16,742
Tell him! Tell him!
