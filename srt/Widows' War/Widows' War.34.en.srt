1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,724
Who is the common link
between of all of them?

2
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:17,058
It's you, Mrs. Palacios.

3
00:00:17,142 --> 00:00:18,268
Why me?

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:21,312
All this time I've been looking for
the suspect, and it turns out, it's you.

5
00:00:21,396 --> 00:00:22,981
Dad, I'm innocent.

6
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,191
Yes, I had issues with them,

7
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,235
but that doesn't mean killed them.

8
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:28,570
Go ahead, arrest her.

9
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:30,613
- Just come with us.
- No!

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,450
If the Palacioses think
that they have a hold on me

11
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,577
for the rest of my life,

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,287
they are wrong.

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:39,497
I am smart even if I didn't graduate.

14
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:44,794
I will find out
what your secret is, Aurora Palacios.

15
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,131
So, I will have a hold on you.

16
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:50,300
Mrs. Palacios, what's happening?

17
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,469
My stomach is aching.

18
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,554
George… why are you bleeding?

19
00:00:54,637 --> 00:00:56,306
PREVIOUSLY

20
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:57,849
I don't know.

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,854
Knock, knock.

22
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:08,860
Aurora, put that down. That can kill.

23
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,820
Isn't this what you're looking for?

24
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,490
You're so interested to find out

25
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:16,117
what's inside my office.

26
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,369
Now, here's your answer.

27
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:26,920
Don't come near me, Aurora.
I will shoot this.

28
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,087
Go ahead.

29
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,507
Shoot me.

30
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,551
I only loaded one bullet in that.

31
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:39,557
That shotgun you're holding
is just as useless as this umbrella.

32
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,934
I'll take care of her.

33
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,478
- This will not happen again.
- Let's go, Galvan.

34
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,438
Your sister is crazy. Let's go.

35
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,731
Rico, come up here.

36
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:47,732
Stand up there.

37
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,778
I finally figured it out.

38
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,198
I want you to pack
your things and leave this house.

39
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,616
Get out of my house.

40
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,327
I should've let Aurora hurt you.

41
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,620
Probably, you deserve it.

42
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:02,747
You are weak.

43
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,166
You are weak. You're such a weakling.

44
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,709
You are weak.

45
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:09,546
<i>Maybe you had too much stress.</i>
<i>That's why you were bleeding.</i>

46
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:10,880
I will just prescribe some medicines,

47
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:13,258
so that the baby
will have a stronger hold.

48
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:15,677
- Baby?
- Didn't you know, Mrs. Palacios?

49
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,553
You're pregnant.

50
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:19,639
Sam, you won't believe this.

51
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,933
What? Has the killer been caught?

52
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:25,436
I know now how Paco fell from the cliff.

53
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,065
Sam, are you listening?

54
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:31,192
Sam.

55
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,530
A baby was conceived
during Basil's birthday?

56
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,418
- Hon?
- Hey.

57
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:49,752
Good morning.

58
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,589
Happy 35th birthday.

59
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,632
Good morning.

60
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:58,052
It's still early.

61
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,597
Let's stay in bed.

62
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,684
But, you have a party later.

63
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:06,978
Your gifts are already arriving.

64
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,067
There's only one gift I want.

65
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,277
What?

66
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,237
You.

67
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,285
Oh, my God.

68
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:28,041
It was your birthday
and yet you left me with a gift.

69
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,711
Thank you, love. Thank you.

70
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,005
Thank you, love.

71
00:03:35,798 --> 00:03:37,717
Lord, thank you.

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,471
Thank you, Lord, for this miracle.
Thank you for this baby.

73
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,514
Lord, thank you.

74
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:46,893
Oh, my God. I'm going to have a baby.

75
00:03:46,976 --> 00:03:49,562
A Palacios baby.

76
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,773
I'm going to be a mother.

77
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:55,401
Thank you, Lord.

78
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,405
Thank you, Lord. Thank you.

79
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:03,910
Thank you.

80
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:09,290
- Yes, Mom.
- I know how the perpetrator did it.

81
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:13,211
He pushed Paco using an umbrella.

82
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,176
I am not weak,
do you understand? I am not weak.

83
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,179
That was solid.

84
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,224
Good thing Sir Galvan gave her an example.

85
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:30,270
You know, even if she's a woman,
she's really annoying.

86
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,063
You'd want to fight with her.

87
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,523
Someday…

88
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:39,570
you'll find out that I am not weak.

89
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:47,328
You know, Sir Galvan
should've done that a long time ago,

90
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:49,247
so she'd knows her place.

91
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,298
Paco was pushed with an umbrella, Sam.

92
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,717
Mom, but…

93
00:05:02,552 --> 00:05:04,304
according to the investigation,

94
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,099
- Paco jumped.
- No, Sam.

95
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,435
Paco wouldn't jump off on his own.

96
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:14,397
He couldn't do that.
Someone pushed him off that cliff.

97
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:17,775
I always felt
that there was something wrong

98
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,652
with the investigation, Sam.

99
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:21,112
But, now I know.

100
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:25,241
I know how that animal escaped

101
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,409
from his sin.

102
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,830
Do you already know who the suspect is?

103
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,542
Do you have any idea…

104
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,795
who could possibly do this to him?

105
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,713
<i>None so far.</i>

106
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:42,467
But, once I figure out who he is…

107
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,177
Oh, Sam…

108
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,637
the things I would do to that demon.

109
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:49,640
You'll send him to jail?

110
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:54,645
Oh, no. Worse, Sam. Much, much worse.

111
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:58,816
I will make that person experience hell.

112
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:02,945
<i>I will kill the members</i>
<i>of his family one by one,</i>

113
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:08,576
so he'd know how to lose a loved one.

114
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,208
Oh, my God.

115
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,710
Thank you, Lord. Thank you so much, Lord.

116
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:20,838
Thank you, Lord.

117
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:22,799
George, what?

118
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:25,593
- Are you okay, George?
- What happened to you?

119
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,096
- I'm doing okay.
- Oh, my.

120
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,305
Hold on.

121
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:33,476
What did we hear
that Sir Galvan is pinning you again,

122
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:35,770
and this time for all
the killings on the estate.

123
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,147
What's the problem with that old monster?

124
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,066
Mom, watch your mouth.

125
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,651
He's indeed a monster

126
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,070
because he won't
stop accusing your sister.

127
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,698
George, wait a second, why…

128
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:51,244
Why does it seem like
you're happy you've been hospitalized?

129
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,913
I am pregnant.

130
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:56,290
What?

131
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:02,213
Aren't you thrilled about my news, Sam?

132
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:09,011
Of course, Mom.

133
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:12,473
I will have my son's case reopened.

134
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,144
Are you sure about that, Mom?

135
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:20,648
Because if we reopened Paco's case,

136
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,400
and we find out…

137
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,112
that he really jumped off
the cliff, you might get hurt.

138
00:07:28,656 --> 00:07:31,576
Thank you, Sam, for your concern, my dear.

139
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:36,622
But, I can face all the pain

140
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:37,874
for Paco.

141
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:42,795
What's important is justice will be served
for my son's death.

142
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:44,672
But, Mom…

143
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,467
I'm sorry, Sam.

144
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:49,385
I need to go. I'll call you later, okay?

145
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,361
I will be an uncle, Mom.

146
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:08,863
Yes.

147
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,410
But wait, George.

148
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,496
Are you sure? Because, you know.

149
00:08:17,371 --> 00:08:19,499
You are barren,
remember? How did that happen?

150
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,793
It's a miracle baby, Mom.

151
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,546
I will become a mother.

152
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,134
Finally, a miracle.
I thought it would never happen, but…

153
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:33,221
the Lord granted my prayers.

154
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:41,479
Hello, baby. This is your Mommy Ruth.

155
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,688
Mommy Ruth?

156
00:08:43,773 --> 00:08:45,233
Of course, I don't
want to be called Grandma.

157
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:47,777
Yuck. It's embarrassing to my baby face.

158
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,278
It's embarrassing to my earrings.

159
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:53,241
Sam…

160
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,951
why are you crying?

161
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,453
Mother…

162
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:01,624
It's Ma'am Aurora.

163
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:05,044
She already knows…

164
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:08,381
that someone pushed
Paco using an umbrella.

165
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,968
How did she know? Who told her?

166
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:14,554
I don't know. I don't know.

167
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:18,432
- What else did she say?
- That's all. That's all she said.

168
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:23,271
Sam, what are we going to do
if Ma'am Aurora finds out

169
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,942
that it was you who pushed Paco?

170
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:32,738
Francis?

171
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,003
You pushed Paco off the cliff, Sam?

172
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,429
Oh, my George.

173
00:09:56,512 --> 00:10:01,017
Sir Galvan should
know that you're pregnant.

174
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,101
Is this the proof?

175
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:04,353
I'll slap this on his face,

176
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:07,815
so he stops pinning this on you
and accusing you.

177
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,900
No, Mom.

178
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,030
- Dad must not know.
- What?

179
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:20,411
Francis, I didn't mean it.

180
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:23,873
You didn't mean it?

181
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,916
When you pushed Paco?

182
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,668
I accidentally pushed him.

183
00:10:27,752 --> 00:10:31,547
I didn't pushed him intentionally.
I didn't mean it.

184
00:10:38,137 --> 00:10:40,431
Why didn't you tell me this?

185
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,434
Wait, what?

186
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,187
Is there something
else you haven't told me?

187
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:49,106
Mom? Sam?

188
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,442
Was it also you who poisoned Basil?

189
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,780
Why not, George?

190
00:10:55,863 --> 00:10:57,365
You should be proud.

191
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,701
You just said it, that's a miracle baby,

192
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,037
and deserves to go viral.

193
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,082
And now you'll keep it
a secret from your father-in-law?

194
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,501
I don't get it.

195
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,379
The baby in my womb is a Palacios.

196
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:14,131
If someone knows that I'm pregnant,

197
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:17,760
I might be
the next target of the Palacios killer.

198
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:20,930
Oh, yeah. I get it.

199
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,559
We need to protect your baby.

200
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,978
But, what if your tummy grows big?

201
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:30,064
We can no longer hide it.

202
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,149
What, Sam? Was it you?

203
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,818
Was it you who killed Basil?

204
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:37,905
Did you use my morphine to poisoned him?

205
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:39,365
I went to jail because of you.

206
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,035
I didn't poison Basil, no.

207
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:46,288
Francis, your sister is not a murderer.

208
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:49,125
What happened to Paco was an accident.

209
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,001
Francis, please.

210
00:11:51,085 --> 00:11:54,505
Please don't think ill of me. Please.

211
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:02,596
If my tummy is already obvious,

212
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,516
maybe they've found the Palacios killer?

213
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,227
Oh, my. We're not sure about that.

214
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,896
Look, the case is not even moving,

215
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:14,608
and instead of solving it,
they are ganging up on you.

216
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,611
I'm ready to face them, Mom.

217
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,031
I will prove my innocence quickly…

218
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:24,243
so they'll focus on looking
for the Palacios killer

219
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,036
and catching him.

220
00:12:26,871 --> 00:12:29,957
And I can face my pregnancy peacefully.

221
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,461
- Mom.
- Why?

222
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,546
There's someone outside.

223
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:44,263
Sorry.

224
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,892
Sorry, Sam. It's good a thing because…

225
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,102
it would be painful if
you had something to do

226
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,353
with why I was imprisoned

227
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,814
for poisoning Basil.

228
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,359
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,207
Oh, my God.

230
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:14,585
It's just you, Rebecca. You scared us.

231
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:20,424
Rebecca… George is pregnant.

232
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:22,676
Your sister just said it, remember?

233
00:13:23,552 --> 00:13:25,095
That's right.

234
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,975
Rebecca, maybe we can just
keep it a secret for now?

235
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:34,939
The Palacios killer might attack her next.

236
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,568
Of course. I won't tell a soul. I promise.

237
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,199
George…

238
00:13:45,282 --> 00:13:46,825
is it true?

239
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,500
- Congratulations, George.
- Thank you.

240
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:00,506
How are you?

241
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:01,799
How are the twins?

242
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,634
Twins?

243
00:14:05,427 --> 00:14:07,972
Twins? What twins?

244
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,974
Don't you remember me anymore?

245
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,607
What's wrong, Rebecca?

246
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:24,572
Rebecca?

247
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,620
I'm just happy for you.

248
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,561
How's the investigation with George?

249
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,022
We still haven't interviewed her yet.

250
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,441
What? Why?

251
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,152
She needs to rest. Doctor's advice.

252
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,490
She found an excuse.
What happened to that woman?

253
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,993
Stress, according to her doctor.

254
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,580
If that woman is
discharged from the hospital,

255
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:15,998
arrest her right away.

256
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,751
I was right.

257
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,545
Paco, you didn't commit suicide.

258
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:24,423
Son, you didn't commit suicide.

259
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,259
I knew it. You could never do that.

260
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,640
Paco…

261
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,310
someone pushed you with an umbrella.

262
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,023
But, why didn't you tell me?

263
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,026
Who, Paco?

264
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,445
Who pushed you?

265
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:56,330
Arrest her? She's not yet
a suspect, Mr. Palacios.

266
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,707
She's just a person
of interest for questioning.

267
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:01,168
But, it came from you.

268
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,296
She is the common link of the victims.

269
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:07,341
Everyone who was killed
had an altercation with George.

270
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,260
She even threatened Beverly's life.

271
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,513
But, that's not enough to sue her.

272
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,722
How about Basil?

273
00:16:14,682 --> 00:16:17,810
My son found out that George is barren.

274
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:20,104
George said it was just okay with Basil.

275
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:23,482
But, you know, knowing my son,

276
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:26,902
I'm sure he wanted
to separate from that woman.

277
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:29,196
Maybe George found out

278
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,281
that's why she killed Basil.

279
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,244
Her other motives with Beverly and Peter,

280
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,246
should I spell them out one by one?

281
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:41,333
You don't know who?

282
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:49,216
Did you turn your back
when that animal pushed you?

283
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:51,135
Answer me.

284
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:55,055
I remember…

285
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,143
nothing.

286
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,105
Okay, let's say she has motives

287
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,983
and opportunities. She has the means,

288
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,610
but where is the solid evidence?

289
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,864
Aren't you the investigator?

290
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:13,574
- Then find them.
- Exactly.

291
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,117
And that's what I'm doing.

292
00:17:15,909 --> 00:17:19,038
I studied all of Sergeant Casas' reports.

293
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,582
I went back to the witnesses' testimonies,

294
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:23,417
even the pieces
of evidence that were gathered.

295
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,587
So, I hope you won't get
ahead of what I should do.

296
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:28,839
You are so slow.

297
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,633
You're no different from Casas.

298
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:35,345
Or, maybe you're
covering up for George too.

299
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,972
Mr. Palacios!

300
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:43,896
Everything that happened
on the cliff is a blur in my mind.

301
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,987
Don't worry, Son.

302
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:56,658
I will find out the truth.

303
00:17:58,619 --> 00:18:01,663
I will find out who pushed you.

304
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:08,128
My sweet, sweet, boy.

305
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,519
Did you just shout at me in my own house?

306
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:24,853
You don't show respect.

307
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,107
If you're looking for respect,
you have to respect me too.

308
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,111
Don't say I'm biased

309
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:34,905
because that's what I hate most.
Don't think of me that way…

310
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,156
Sir.

311
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:40,577
But…

312
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:43,038
don't worry, Mr. Palacios.

313
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,875
If Ms. George is really the killer,

314
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,086
I will make sure that she goes to jail.

315
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,714
But, again. At this point,
she's only a person of interest.

316
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:55,425
The evidence against her is weak,

317
00:18:56,385 --> 00:18:58,011
so she's not a suspect.

318
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,807
So, please. Treat her as such.

319
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:21,952
Oh, my God.
I thought Paco's case was over.

320
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,746
It's still here.

321
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,917
Sam, let's just go somewhere far.

322
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:32,212
Let's go to the province or abroad.

323
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,257
You'll get an inheritance from Paco.

324
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,435
Sam, don't answer.

325
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:02,492
Hello, Mom.

326
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,370
Sam, pack your things.

327
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,789
You'll go back to the estate tomorrow.

328
00:20:13,587 --> 00:20:19,009
- What?
- Help me find your husband's killer.

329
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,678
We will play detectives.

330
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:35,108
<i>I need you here, Sam.</i>

331
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:39,821
I need you to help me find the demon
that killed your husband.

332
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,408
Tomorrow at 7:00 a.m.,
I'll have someone fetch you. Is that okay?

333
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:46,370
But, Mom. Isn't it still dangerous?

334
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,664
Don't worry, Sam.

335
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:50,624
I will triple your security.

336
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,546
Mom…

337
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:02,135
can we just do it next time
after they've found the killer?

338
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,553
<i>Don't you want to catch</i>

339
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,847
who killed your husband, Sam?

340
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:08,684
Are you not happy that I have a lead?

341
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:10,686
<i>Why does it seem like you're not happy?</i>

342
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,731
Why does it feel like
you don't want to know who killed Paco?

343
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,320
Mom, I'm just scared but…

344
00:21:21,905 --> 00:21:25,158
All right. Okay, tomorrow. 7:00 a.m.

345
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,120
Good.

346
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,959
Sam?

347
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:37,713
Sam? Sam, why did you agree?

348
00:21:40,048 --> 00:21:41,508
She might suspect.

349
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,261
She might suspect
if I don't agree, Francis.

350
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:46,763
But, you will help her find the person

351
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,850
who pushed Paco? But, that's you.

352
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:52,602
No.

353
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,396
I won't let her catch me.

354
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:57,024
I will do everything
so she won't catch me.

355
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,359
I won't let her catch me.

356
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,237
Okay, and I'm just here.

357
00:22:02,321 --> 00:22:03,822
I will help you.

358
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,533
I will not leave you in whatever battle.

359
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,578
We will mislead Ma'am Aurora,

360
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,455
so she won't catch you.

361
00:22:19,129 --> 00:22:20,339
You will help?

362
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:24,176
You will help
with Sergeant Royales investigation?

363
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,845
- Yes.
- I'm impressed with you.

364
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:30,849
Even if the Palacioses don't accept you,
you're still concerned about them.

365
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,726
They are my family, Rico.

366
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,561
I want to protect them.

367
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:38,273
And that will only happen
if they catch that Palacios killer.

368
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:40,400
How can you fight the killer?

369
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:41,985
How many victims did he kill already?

370
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:43,862
Well…

371
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:47,783
I won't just stand here
while he kills my family one by one.

372
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,495
Even if our bosses are driving us away,

373
00:22:51,578 --> 00:22:53,371
especially Ma'am Aurora?

374
00:22:58,376 --> 00:22:59,503
Paco…

375
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:04,341
Paco…

376
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,927
I won't leave this place.

377
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,096
I won't leave Rebecca.

378
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:13,308
Especially as the Palacios killer
is just around.

379
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:17,312
You have a good heart, Jericho.
I hope they see that.

380
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:21,066
And they shouldn't
let you stay here in the staff room.

381
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:22,275
You're a Palacios.

382
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:25,153
I don't want to force myself on them.

383
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:26,488
I'm okay here.

384
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:31,493
As long as I'm here
to protect Rebecca and the Palacioses.

385
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,121
If the Palacios killer attacks the person

386
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,498
who likes you the least,
which is Ma'am Aurora,

387
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,291
- will you save her?
- Yes.

388
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:42,337
Yes, as long as
they're a Palacios, I will protect them.

389
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,929
Paco… Paco, my son.

390
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:54,975
Paco…

391
00:23:59,187 --> 00:24:00,355
<i>Paco?</i>

392
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,818
- I'll go ahead.
- Where are you going?

393
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:06,736
To the mansion.

394
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:11,616
I will just check
that the security are doing their rounds.

395
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,202
I want to be sure
because the killer might outsmart them.

396
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:15,287
All right.

397
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:16,955
Ever since you came here,

398
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:19,916
every night you always
check if your family is safe.

399
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,920
Hey.

400
00:24:24,588 --> 00:24:26,089
- Hey.
- Jericho.

401
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,177
- Rebecca.
- Jericho…

402
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,469
What happened to you?

403
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,638
I can't sleep.

404
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:36,141
I can't sleep.

405
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:39,352
I can't stop thinking about
what happened earlier in the hospital.

406
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,855
What happened in the hospital?

407
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,984
There's a nurse, okay?

408
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:48,403
There's this nurse who came to me.

409
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:51,364
And she was looking for my twins.

410
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:54,284
What? What twins?

411
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:57,662
I don't know. I don't know.

412
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,540
Oh, maybe…

413
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,000
Could it be?

414
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,545
Could it be what?

415
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,299
I thought I got pregnant…

416
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,803
and gave birth to twin babies.

417
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,055
What?

418
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:19,601
You can't remember that you gave birth?

419
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:21,686
So, where are they?

420
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,313
I don't know.

421
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:26,149
And you know my condition.

422
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:28,902
Well…

423
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,947
When I was in the hospital,

424
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:34,950
it felt familiar.

425
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:37,452
And then I remembered…

426
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,038
there was a nursery…

427
00:25:42,582 --> 00:25:44,251
But, my memory was hazy.

428
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:48,505
Do you think…

429
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:53,134
Do you think I gave birth to twin babies?

430
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,057
There's only one way to find out.

431
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,018
You need to ask your Auntie Aurora.

432
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,312
I'm sure…

433
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,399
they'd know if you got pregnant

434
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:08,566
and gave birth.

435
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,755
My son, Paco.

436
00:26:31,464 --> 00:26:32,424
<i>Paco?</i>

437
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:35,218
Paco!

438
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:44,352
Wake up.

439
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,236
Paco…

440
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,199
Ma'am Aurora…

441
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,660
I heard you moaning.

442
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:02,579
You're having a nightmare, madam.

443
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:04,873
Sam?

444
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,293
What about Sam?

445
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,966
It was Sam who pushed Paco from the cliff.

446
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,196
Let's just proceed with the interrogation.

447
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,828
Is your lawyer on the way?

448
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,122
Yes, but we can start now.

449
00:27:46,206 --> 00:27:48,792
I can and will answer everything.

450
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:12,065
Oh, Rebecca…

451
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,825
Is something wrong?

452
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,329
When did I start getting sick, Auntie?

453
00:28:28,873 --> 00:28:30,375
I think…

454
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,587
five years ago. Why?

455
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,590
Before I got sick…

456
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,009
Yes?

457
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,971
Did I get pregnant?

458
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:47,350
So, where will we start?

459
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:49,728
- With Basil?
- Yes.

460
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:53,398
Well, what else have
Sergeant Casas and Sergeant Villa

461
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,776
not asked yet?

462
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,236
Go ahead and ask.

463
00:28:59,487 --> 00:29:01,573
Okay, Ms. Georgina.

464
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,617
George, don't say anything yet.

465
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,828
What the hell are you doing here?

466
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,247
- Don't meddle here.
- I'm here…

467
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:15,295
Auntie…

468
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,714
did I get pregnant?

469
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,300
Did I have a baby?

470
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:29,058
Why are you asking this nonsense, Rebecca?

471
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:31,436
This is funny to you?

472
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,397
No. Of course not.

473
00:29:34,481 --> 00:29:35,732
Then answer me.

474
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:39,944
Did I get pregnant? Did I have a baby?

475
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:41,905
No, Rebecca.

476
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,200
Then why did a nurse
from the hospital ask me

477
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,743
about my twins?

478
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,495
What?

479
00:29:48,578 --> 00:29:51,539
Who's that nurse? What's her name?

480
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:54,459
I'm here to represent George, Uncle.

481
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,252
Don't call me that.

482
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:59,923
All right, Mr. Palacios.

483
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,008
Sir, may I?

484
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,976
Why do you want to know?

485
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:16,606
To stop her from telling me the truth?

486
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,859
Oh, please, Rebecca.

487
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:23,488
You didn't get pregnant.
You didn't give birth.

488
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:24,697
Liar.

489
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:27,283
Then why am I hearing those babies crying?

490
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:37,335
I don't know.

491
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,714
You always hear things. Remember, Rebecca?

492
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,341
You have visions.

493
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:46,678
Maybe those cries are from your future.

494
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,305
They're not. Of course,
I know the difference

495
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:51,140
between the past and the future.

496
00:30:51,224 --> 00:30:54,686
Those babies crying,

497
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,939
I'm sure those are from my past.
Please tell me the truth.

498
00:30:58,022 --> 00:30:59,983
I'm telling you the truth.

499
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,818
No, you're not!

500
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:05,655
George…

501
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,703
Okay, let's start?

502
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:15,748
Sure, let's start. I just have a question.

503
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,335
Are you sure that George is
the only common denominator

504
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:21,462
in all the killings
here inside the estate?

505
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,923
Because there are a lot
of people with a common link.

506
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:30,388
Like… Mrs. Palacios.

507
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,683
Let's just say she has
an axe to grind with the three victims.

508
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,519
She has possible motives.

509
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:40,648
With Basil, they were fighting
over the company's position.

510
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:45,486
With Beverly, she is carrying Basil's baby
who is older than Sam's baby,

511
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:49,824
who they want to be the heir
to Palacios Mining.

512
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:53,328
With Peter, Auntie Aurora
couldn't accept him

513
00:31:53,411 --> 00:31:54,746
when he pretended to be a Palacios.

514
00:31:57,999 --> 00:32:00,001
Please tell me the truth.

515
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:02,211
Did I get pregnant?

516
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:05,882
Did I have a baby?

517
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:12,138
Auntie… tell me.

518
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,432
Did I have a baby? Did I get pregnant?

519
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,892
Rebecca, no.

520
00:32:15,975 --> 00:32:17,894
No, Rebecca! No.

521
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:19,562
- I need to know the truth.
- Loray.

522
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:20,480
- I need to know the truth.
- Rico.

523
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:23,024
- It's in my mind, Auntie.
- No.

524
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:25,693
- Calm down, Rebecca.
- Please, calm down.

525
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,445
No.

526
00:32:27,528 --> 00:32:28,404
- Stop saying that.
- Please, tell me.

527
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:29,739
- Did I get pregnant?
- Take her back to her room.

528
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:30,823
Take her back to her room.

529
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:31,950
- Did I have a baby?
- Now.

530
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:33,701
No, please let me.

531
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,912
- I know it in my mind.
- No, Rebecca. No.

532
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:39,457
And in my heart, I know it.

533
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,752
Please. Auntie.

534
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:45,880
Tell me. Did I get pregnant?

535
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,299
Did I have a baby?

536
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,634
Please.

537
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,477
- Ma'am Aurora?
- What?

538
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,021
Sam and her family are here already.

539
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,067
Let them wait.

540
00:33:08,736 --> 00:33:11,990
I need to calm down, Amando.

541
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:27,714
Even Vivian could have possible motives.

542
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,135
We all know here
that Basil didn't like her.

543
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:34,470
And they were only able
to enter the estate

544
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,763
when Basil died.

545
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:40,476
Sofia is an heir.

546
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,106
Beverly's baby is a threat to her.

547
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,816
Peter is also a threat to her.

548
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:49,402
- Attorney Morales…
- Please…

549
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,904
Emil, let me finish.

550
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,075
We shouldn't have gone back here.

551
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,994
We're here already.

552
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,787
Just remember what we talked about.

553
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,081
Ma'am Aurora must not know anything about…

554
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,332
Mother.

555
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,917
Someone might hear you, Mom.

556
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,755
Hello, Sam.

557
00:34:09,338 --> 00:34:11,340
- Hi, Mom.
- No, no, no.

558
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:12,675
You stay there.

559
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:18,347
So…

560
00:34:19,015 --> 00:34:22,268
How's my dear daughter-in-law?

561
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,022
I'm okay, Mom. Just a bit…

562
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,986
Sam.

563
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:35,698
Lastly…

564
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,659
Mrs. Samantha Palacios.

565
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:40,787
She practically has the same motives

566
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:44,332
as all the other
possible persons of interest I mentioned.

567
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,834
Paco and Basil were enemies.

568
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:52,090
And George is also an enemy of Sam.

569
00:34:54,425 --> 00:34:56,302
Sam is carrying a Palacios baby.

570
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:58,554
Beverly's baby was a threat

571
00:34:59,138 --> 00:35:00,723
and Peter was a threat too.

572
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,019
It was you, Sam.

573
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,815
My suspicion before was right.

574
00:35:09,607 --> 00:35:12,735
You pushed Paco off the cliff.

575
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:14,570
Why did you push my sister?

576
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:18,407
Why don't you ask
your sister who is a killer?

577
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,370
Mom, I don't know
what you're talking about.

578
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,539
You're pretending to be innocent, Sam?

579
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,332
You're acting like a saint?

580
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,584
Don't play dumb with me.

581
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,003
It was you who pushed my son.

582
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,548
It was you who killed your husband.

583
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,843
So, tell me.

584
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,846
Why are you saying that George is
the only common denominator?

585
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,931
Just so you'd know, Attorney,

586
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,517
we are looking into all this.

587
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:49,480
We're just checking all
the avenues to make sure.

588
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:51,440
And with what you said,

589
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,777
it's all here on my list.

590
00:35:59,866 --> 00:36:03,870
So, now, can we interview Ms. Georgina?

591
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,168
Sure.

592
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,423
Sam, I remember.

593
00:36:21,387 --> 00:36:23,723
<i>You had an umbrella with you</i>

594
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:26,517
<i>the night Paco fell off the cliff.</i>

595
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:30,271
<i>You used that umbrella to push him.</i>

596
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:34,192
That's why your footprints
were far from the cliff.

597
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:38,863
You got through that investigation
because the investigators were stupid.

598
00:36:38,946 --> 00:36:40,281
You fool.

599
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,035
Francis. Francis.

600
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,661
- Francis.
- Stop it.

601
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:46,746
- Stop it.
- Ma'am…

602
00:36:46,829 --> 00:36:48,039
You fool.

603
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:50,291
Francis.

604
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:57,173
Iñigo, thank you. I really appreciate it.

605
00:36:57,256 --> 00:36:58,507
Don't worry about it.

606
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,010
You know I would do everything for Basil,

607
00:37:01,802 --> 00:37:04,722
and… of course, for you.

608
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,851
You know, I think you don't need me here.

609
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:13,147
I am confident
that you didn't do anything bad.

610
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:14,649
You can easily defend yourself.

611
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,069
Thank you for the vote of confidence.

612
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,404
- You're welcome.
- You.

613
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,406
Why are you still here?

614
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,660
Didn't I tell you
not to let him come here?

615
00:37:32,792 --> 00:37:34,168
- You're too much.
- Mother…

616
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,504
- Mother. Mother.
- Don't hurt my mother.

617
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,630
Francis.

618
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,298
That's enough.

619
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:41,467
Stop it, stop it.

620
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,096
Stop it… Stop it…

621
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,224
- Stop it.
- Stop it.

622
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,560
I didn't push…
I didn't push Paco off the cliff.

623
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,979
Please, stop it.

624
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,773
Mr. Palacios,

625
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:57,692
my client and I are just talking

626
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,944
about her interview earlier
with the investigators.

627
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:01,821
You should talk outside.

628
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,532
You can do it anywhere,
even in hell, but not here.

629
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,827
Dad, what's your problem with Iñigo?

630
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:09,495
He knows what the problem is.

631
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:12,498
Right, Iñigo?

632
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,127
What the hell?

633
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:18,921
Dad…

634
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:25,094
Didn't I tell you
to stay away from my son?

635
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:26,012
<i>Dad.</i>

636
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,805
Go, just go.

637
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:31,142
Just go. Just go.

638
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:34,812
You haven't told this woman…

639
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:37,273
why I don't want you?

640
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,235
Or, you want me to tell her?

641
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,073
You're a liar.

642
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,951
We both know you did it.

643
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,579
You pushed my son off the cliff.

644
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,373
You murdered my son.

645
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,460
- You fool.
- Stop it.

646
00:38:57,543 --> 00:38:59,462
You too.

647
00:38:59,545 --> 00:39:01,130
Stop it.

648
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,924
Stop hurting my children.

649
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,343
Stop it.

650
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:07,470
What, Iñigo?

651
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:10,806
Iñigo, what is Dad saying?

652
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,853
Don't mind him.

653
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,068
All right, Mr. Palacios.

654
00:39:22,651 --> 00:39:24,362
You will not see me here again.

655
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:26,781
I will not come back here anymore.

656
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:30,201
George, if you need to consult something,

657
00:39:30,826 --> 00:39:32,745
let's just meet in the office.

658
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:35,831
Good.

659
00:39:42,421 --> 00:39:43,464
Iñigo…

660
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:45,716
You can tell me.

661
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,843
Whatever that is, it's safe with me.

662
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:55,351
What kind of monster are you, Sam?

663
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,980
After everything my son did for you,

664
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:02,024
you did that to him?

665
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:08,280
I didn't do anything bad to Paco.
I didn't do anything.

666
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:12,118
Go ahead, Samantha. Keep saying that.

667
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:16,997
And even if you keep
saying that over and over,

668
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,794
it won't change the fact
that you pushed and killed my son.

669
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:28,426
It's nothing, George.
Don't worry about it.

670
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,719
What did you do?

671
00:40:30,803 --> 00:40:35,224
Uncle Galvan and Basil fought before
because of me.

672
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:37,893
Can we just not talk about it?

673
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:40,980
Okay.

674
00:40:43,315 --> 00:40:44,650
I will eventually tell you…

675
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:47,111
but not now.

676
00:40:48,237 --> 00:40:49,196
Not just yet.

677
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,369
Thank you.

678
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:03,627
Stop your accusations, Aurora.

679
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:05,087
You have no proof.

680
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:08,048
Mercy, stop defending your daughter

681
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,718
who is a murderer.

682
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:15,097
Remember, what I told you, Sam?

683
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:20,644
I will make that demon

684
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:24,565
who did this to my son experience hell.

685
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:30,613
I will kill
the people he loves one by one.

686
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:36,076
That means you, Castilloses.

687
00:41:37,161 --> 00:41:40,206
I will kill all of you…

688
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,791
because of the sin of that woman!

689
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,056
Mother, Sam, come on.
Let's get out of here.

690
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:02,770
- Where do you think you're going?
- It's none of your business.

691
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,271
We're leaving this place.

692
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:15,032
One more step

693
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,911
and the next shot
will go through one of you.

694
00:42:31,590 --> 00:42:33,217
George, I want you to replace your lawyer.

695
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:35,594
Why, Dad? So you can pin me down more

696
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,971
with your accusations against me?

697
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,514
- I'm sorry but, no.
- Get out of my house.

698
00:42:38,597 --> 00:42:39,890
- Let go of me.
- Sir Galvan.

699
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,808
Get out.

700
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:42,434
<i>I want to reopen my son's case.</i>

701
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,645
<i>My son did not</i>
<i>commit suicide. He was pushed.</i>

702
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,355
It was Sam.

703
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:48,357
<i>Detective, why were only</i>
<i>my shoeprints seen that night?</i>

704
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,193
George and Mom Aurora were also there.

705
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:52,695
Sergeant Casas covered it up.

706
00:42:52,778 --> 00:42:54,905
Sergeant Casas covered up for George?

707
00:42:54,989 --> 00:42:57,408
<i>That makes her more of a suspect than me.</i>

708
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,743
- Dad.
- George is pregnant.

709
00:42:59,827 --> 00:43:02,079
It was you who pushed my son, Samantha.

710
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:02,955
You were there.

711
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:08,002
I just agreed to this stupid DNA test
to prove that I am carrying Basil's child.

712
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:11,130
But, I will not agree
to him growing up here with you.

713
00:43:11,213 --> 00:43:14,592
She still denied
that I got pregnant and had a baby.

714
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,011
I saw your picture that you got pregnant.

715
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:19,054
DNA results came.

716
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:21,515
I will keep my baby
with Basil away from you.

717
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:23,475
You and Paco fought before he died.

718
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:24,518
You're an animal.
