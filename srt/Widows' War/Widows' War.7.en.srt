1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,641
<i>Mrs. Palacios and Ms. Georgina</i>

2
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,728
<i>said they saw you</i>
<i>in front of Mr. Palacios' dead body.</i>

3
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:21,730
He took me to a sex party.

4
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:24,065
I didn't like it. That's why we fought.

5
00:00:24,149 --> 00:00:25,483
I wanted us to separate.

6
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,068
You need to come with me.

7
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:29,988
<i>Ms. Samantha, Ms. Georgina,</i>

8
00:00:30,071 --> 00:00:32,032
<i>are those the sandals</i>
<i>you were wearing last night?</i>

9
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,199
PREVIOUSLY

10
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,827
Sir, Ms. Samantha's are a match.

11
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,038
Yes, I came here last night!

12
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,416
But I didn't make it in time to stop Paco.
He'd already jumped off the cliff!

13
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:42,959
You're a liar!

14
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:44,377
Why did you lie?

15
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:46,004
That is what I would think.

16
00:00:46,087 --> 00:00:48,506
That you were there and that it was you
who pushed Mr. Palacios.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,633
It wasn't me. I didn't kill him.
Please, believe me.

18
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,302
But you lied.

19
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:54,179
I won't bury my son.

20
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,265
I will have him cremated.

21
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:01,728
<i>I want his ashes</i>
<i>to be with me all the time.</i>

22
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:08,485
Ma'am Aurora gave instructions
not to let you go near Sir Paco.

23
00:01:08,568 --> 00:01:11,154
<i>If she wants respect,</i>
<i>she should respect me too!</i>

24
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,575
How dare you touch my son's ashes?!

25
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,508
PACO'S COUSIN

26
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:34,552
PACO'S MOTHER

27
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,179
PACO'S WIFE

28
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:37,138
PACO'S COUSIN'S WIFE

29
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,094
- No!
- Ma'am! Ma'am Aurora!

30
00:02:58,177 --> 00:03:00,263
- Ma'am Aurora, stop it.
- My husband.

31
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:01,306
Ma'am, stop it.

32
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,724
- Why are you letting this girl…
- Ma'am! Ma'am!

33
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,851
- …come closer to my son?
- Ma'am, that's enough!

34
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:06,269
Wait! Let me go!

35
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:07,186
Hey, you fool!

36
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,689
Let go of my sister!

37
00:03:09,772 --> 00:03:10,565
That's enough.

38
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:11,983
- Come on, that's enough!
- Let go of me!

39
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:13,234
You can't do this to us!

40
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,485
Hold on! Hold on!

41
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:15,862
You can't do this to us!

42
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:17,071
Wait!

43
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,156
Sam!

44
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,616
Let go of me!

45
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,117
- Let go!
- Stop it!

46
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,620
Stop it! We're leaving now.

47
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,331
Stop it. Stop it.

48
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,374
There's nothing we can do.

49
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:31,127
Let's go. We don't stand a chance
against those people.

50
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,333
As instructed by General Alejaga,

51
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:12,919
we are here to give you details.

52
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:28,935
As of now, we don't have
enough evidence to file a case

53
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,520
against Ms. Samantha Palacios,

54
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:32,105
our primary suspect.

55
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:33,481
What?

56
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:38,861
She was there! She pushed my son!

57
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:45,451
It's impossible that she pushed
Mr. Paco Palacios.

58
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,208
<i>The shoe prints belonging to Ms. Samantha,</i>

59
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,462
<i>they stopped at 2.5 meters</i>
<i>from the edge of the cliff.</i>

60
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,922
<i>From where she was standing,</i>

61
00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:00,758
<i>no matter how she pushed Mr. Palacios,</i>

62
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,885
<i>he wouldn't have fallen off the cliff.</i>

63
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:10,059
<i>Now, if Ms. Samantha had moved</i>
<i>another meter closer,</i>

64
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,602
<i>then it would have been possible</i>

65
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,689
<i>that she'd pushed Mr. Palacios</i>
<i>off the cliff.</i>

66
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,442
And we were able to get
the initial results

67
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,444
of the autopsy of Mr. Palacios,

68
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:23,114
and we found high levels
of alcohol in his system.

69
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:32,498
Mr. Paco Palacios was drunk.

70
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:37,128
He was drunk the night
he fell off the cliff.

71
00:05:37,211 --> 00:05:38,713
So you're saying that he committed sui…?

72
00:05:38,796 --> 00:05:43,468
Mr. Paco Palacios' death may have been
caused by him accidentally falling down.

73
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,305
No! No!

74
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:51,434
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

75
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,606
No! No, Paco!

76
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:58,816
No!

77
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,569
No! Paco!

78
00:06:10,369 --> 00:06:13,039
Paco, no.

79
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:30,932
My son, my son!

80
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,392
Paco! Paco!

81
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,665
No! No!

82
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,630
It's over, Sam.

83
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,257
Your ordeal is over.

84
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:08,970
Lord, I'm not fond of praying

85
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,096
but thank you so much.

86
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,014
Thank you, thank you.

87
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,599
Sam, you're already acquitted.

88
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,976
You should be happy.

89
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,898
How can I be happy, Francis?

90
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,778
I lost a husband.

91
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,367
I'm not yet ready.

92
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:36,456
No woman is ready to become a widow, Sam.

93
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:40,960
It's difficult and painful.

94
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,920
You need to accept it.

95
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,093
Don't let sadness defeat you.

96
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,595
Fight, Sam.

97
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,558
Sam…

98
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,602
you can do it.

99
00:07:57,685 --> 00:08:00,563
We can do it. Mother and I are here.

100
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:01,439
You monster!

101
00:08:01,522 --> 00:08:03,065
- Come here!
- Ma'am Aurora!

102
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,444
Ma'am Aurora, that's enough!

103
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:07,987
You will pay for what you did

104
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,280
- to my son!
- Ma'am, stop it!

105
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:11,699
Ma'am, stop it!

106
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,578
That's enough! Ma'am, stop it!

107
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,497
You fool!

108
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,082
Come here! You fool!

109
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,751
- Ouch!
- Stop it!

110
00:08:21,834 --> 00:08:23,044
- Ma'am, what's with you?
- You fool!

111
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,546
Stop it!

112
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,008
Let go of me!

113
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,013
You're so shameless!

114
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:38,768
I gave way to you before
because you lost your son,

115
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,979
but I won't let you hurt me now!

116
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,068
Come on!

117
00:08:48,277 --> 00:08:49,362
What, Sam?

118
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:53,074
Do you think you can escape from
what you did?

119
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,452
No, the investigation is not yet over!

120
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,287
The truth will come out.

121
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,915
You killed my son!

122
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:11,342
Galvan, call General Alejaga.

123
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,929
I want more thorough investigation.

124
00:09:15,012 --> 00:09:17,098
Replace that investigator!

125
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:22,478
Even if General Alejaga himself
were to investigate this case,

126
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,856
Sam would still be proven innocent

127
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,901
because she did not kill Paco.

128
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,112
What?

129
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:36,617
Auntie… Paco committed suicide.

130
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:41,581
He killed himself.

131
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:45,167
Paco will never commit suicide! Never!

132
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,420
Auntie, it's true.

133
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,507
He told me.

134
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,303
Love, you said Paco would never do that.

135
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:58,556
I was only saying that
because I didn't want it to be true.

136
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:02,143
I was really hoping that
Sam really killed Paco

137
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:07,064
so that what my cousin said
would not be true.

138
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,984
That he would end his life at midnight.

139
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:13,738
Auntie, I called him.
We were supposed to talk about business.

140
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,991
But when he answered, he was crying.

141
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:21,704
He said he was scared that
Sam would leave him.

142
00:10:22,913 --> 00:10:25,416
You're just making this up, Basil.

143
00:10:26,417 --> 00:10:29,545
Auntie, Paco has always had
abandonment issues, remember?

144
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,297
When his Papa died,

145
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,174
even when he was still young then,

146
00:10:33,257 --> 00:10:35,009
he said he felt abandoned.

147
00:10:35,092 --> 00:10:36,552
- He was traumatized.
- Shut up!

148
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,430
- Shut up! Shut up!
- When we were young…

149
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:42,683
Auntie, when we were young,
when we were teenagers,

150
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:44,727
his first girlfriend left him

151
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,438
and he attempted suicide even back then!

152
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:50,232
I was only able to convince him
not to do it.

153
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:57,114
The moments you were fighting,

154
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:59,617
when you were forcing him
to co-manage the company

155
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,452
against his will!

156
00:11:03,746 --> 00:11:04,830
He told me…

157
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,211
He said that he felt abandoned,
even by his own mother!

158
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:11,879
No! No!

159
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,131
No! No! No! No! No!

160
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,092
No! No! No!

161
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:17,385
No!

162
00:11:45,996 --> 00:11:50,418
Let's sue that devil
mother-in-law of yours!

163
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,044
She almost killed you earlier.

164
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:55,256
Mother, I don't want any more trouble.

165
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,007
Let's just understand her.

166
00:11:57,091 --> 00:12:01,053
Let's just think about
where she's coming from.

167
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,556
She's a mother. She's just lost her son.

168
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,767
Let's just understand her.

169
00:12:06,851 --> 00:12:08,352
Sam, you're so kind.

170
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:11,605
Come here

171
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:14,442
Ouch.

172
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,610
Sorry.

173
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,279
You scared me earlier.

174
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,740
If something had happened to you,

175
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:24,243
I could have killed that Aurora!

176
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:29,790
I wish they'd just beat me up.
They could do it as much as they liked.

177
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:33,627
But if they try to hurt you, Sam,
I'll fight them to the death.

178
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:03,908
Sam, what's your plan now?

179
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:13,334
Let's leave this place.

180
00:13:15,419 --> 00:13:19,840
Let's just go back
to our simple, quiet life.

181
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:23,260
But we aren't prepared for that.

182
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,553
Neither of you have a job.

183
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,764
Francis can't go back into construction,

184
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,057
and you…

185
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,808
Mother, it's okay.

186
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,268
Don't worry, okay?

187
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:33,187
Sam will just call her boss.

188
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:34,647
I'm sure they'll ask her back.

189
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:38,150
She's the best interior designer
in their company.

190
00:13:39,568 --> 00:13:42,696
Mother, we don't need to rely on
the Palacios family to live.

191
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,742
We were able to manage before, right?

192
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,994
We can do this.
We still have each other, right?

193
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:56,335
Let's go and pack our bags
so we can leave.

194
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,881
Let's go tomorrow.

195
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:04,843
I want to say goodbye

196
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:07,638
to my husband properly before…

197
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:09,223
I leave this place.

198
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,162
Fix this, General Alejaga.

199
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,664
I don't know why you gave us

200
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,250
that kind of investigator. He's worthless!

201
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,210
Replace him

202
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:40,337
and don't accept any statement from Basil.

203
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,255
He's a liar.

204
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:43,007
Do you understand?

205
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:46,010
- Yes.
- Go and do something.

206
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:48,554
Replace him!

207
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:51,557
General Alejaga, please leave.

208
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,894
No!

209
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,854
You leave. I don't need you here.

210
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,272
Aurora, stop.

211
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,901
I'm asking you, please leave.

212
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:13,412
Auntie, Sam is innocent.

213
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:15,748
That investigator and his team know it.

214
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:22,254
Do you think if you replace them,
they won't talk?

215
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:28,594
We know Sam. She's a fighter.

216
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,804
And don't you forget.

217
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:33,641
Her connection to Dr. Orly.

218
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,645
Do you think…

219
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,939
that won't come out

220
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,608
if you force that investigation
with others?

221
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:48,197
The people will talk about
the Palacios name.

222
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,950
And our competitors will take
advantage of it.

223
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,160
Look, Aurora…

224
00:15:57,164 --> 00:16:01,168
Even if we often fight,

225
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:04,254
we are still family.

226
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,548
We have a name to protect.

227
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:11,011
Everything we keep should remain hidden

228
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,264
within the confines
of the Palacios' Estate.

229
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:22,940
It's just…

230
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:26,694
It's just that I really want Sam to pay.

231
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,740
That leech costs me my Paco.

232
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,496
Basil…

233
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:41,083
my son killed himself all because of her.

234
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,922
Auntie…

235
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,800
we have to protect the Palacios name.

236
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:52,553
And in doing that,

237
00:16:52,636 --> 00:17:01,061
you want me to let
that evil lowlife go scot-free?

238
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,521
Basil…

239
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,028
Leave.

240
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,530
Please, leave me alone.

241
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:42,436
Know your place, Amando.

242
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,564
You're just a servant here.

243
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,831
Good job, son.

244
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,416
You hit the nail on the head.

245
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:08,629
You took Sam's side to hurt Aurora.

246
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:09,880
And now,

247
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,550
the queen is starting to crumble.

248
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:20,409
Ms. Sam was acquitted.

249
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,494
That's old news.

250
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:24,538
The latest

251
00:19:24,621 --> 00:19:30,294
is that Sir Basil confirmed that
Sir Paco did commit suicide.

252
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,423
Could it be that he's just doing it
to destroy Sir Parco's reputation?

253
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,844
Destroy his reputation?
Then what was the drama I saw earlier?

254
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:40,762
Is he pretending to have loved Sir Paco?

255
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:43,015
Hey, stop it.

256
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:48,020
Even if the two were fighting,
they were still family. Agree?

257
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,188
Okay.

258
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,565
Right?

259
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:52,900
All you do is gossip.

260
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,009
Love, Papa has other companions.

261
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:41,156
Hon, when will you bring us here?

262
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,909
Let's talk about it some other time, okay?

263
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:45,786
- Mom.
- What?

264
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,954
Let's not be ambitious.

265
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,666
We're not welcome here,
and we'll never be.

266
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:54,294
Sofia, this is not the right time
to talk about it.

267
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:55,837
That's what you always say.

268
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,547
This is not the right time
to talk about it.

269
00:20:57,631 --> 00:20:59,591
When will it ever be the right time?

270
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,425
George?

271
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,468
- Let's go, Mom.
- Soon.

272
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,221
- Who's that pretty girl over there?
- Very soon.

273
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,430
That pretty one.

274
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,269
That's Sofia. She's Basil's half-sister.

275
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,063
Is this the first time you've seen her?

276
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,898
She's your schoolmate.

277
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,901
She's studying in the school
where you transferred.

278
00:21:17,985 --> 00:21:21,989
- We are here at my nephew's wake.
- Mom, just let it go.

279
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,157
So when will it be the right time?

280
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,287
Soon, okay?

281
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:31,331
Leave.

282
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,917
You're not family.

283
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,003
Oh, but we are.

284
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,964
Or at least my daughter is.

285
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:43,427
You see even if I'm just
your father's mistress,

286
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:49,099
my daughter, Sofia,
is Galvan's daughter too.

287
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:50,809
So, she's family.

288
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:54,855
And that makes her your sister.

289
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,525
Okay, half-sister.

290
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,110
But sister nonetheless.

291
00:22:00,193 --> 00:22:02,612
She's your flesh and blood. Your family.

292
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,033
And there's nothing you can do about it.

293
00:22:06,116 --> 00:22:07,409
And the reason we are here

294
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:10,954
is because Sofia and Paco are cousins.

295
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,540
- And we want to pay…
- I'll say it once again.

296
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:15,125
Leave.

297
00:22:16,543 --> 00:22:18,920
Come on, can your trash outside.

298
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:20,339
Don't bring it in.

299
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,673
Vivian, I told you not to…

300
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,343
I told you already, Mommy.
We're not welcome here.

301
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:26,887
He said we're garbage.

302
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,014
Sofia.

303
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,557
Canal language.

304
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:31,933
How dare you?!

305
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,393
You deserve that.

306
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:35,353
Vivian.

307
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:57,292
- I'll just go to the bathroom.
- Okay.

308
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:25,946
Sorry.

309
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,908
I'm Edward.

310
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,160
Ward for short.

311
00:23:33,245 --> 00:23:34,538
You are?

312
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,501
It's none of your business!

313
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:44,172
Nice name but it's long.

314
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:47,926
Hey, wait!

315
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,554
None of your business?

316
00:23:51,805 --> 00:23:53,932
We'll see each other again…

317
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,018
Sofia.

318
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,696
Louie?

319
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:11,992
What are you doing here?

320
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,828
Nothing.

321
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:16,079
I just passed by.

322
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,685
- Don't, Sam.
- I'll just say goodbye.

323
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:40,103
I said don't!

324
00:24:52,616 --> 00:24:53,575
Not now.

325
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,497
Come back later around dawn.

326
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:03,001
What?

327
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:05,253
I'm doing this for Sir Paco.

328
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:07,881
He loved you.

329
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:12,135
I know he'd have wanted you
to say goodbye to him.

330
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:36,660
Well, well, well, if it isn't the killers.

331
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,536
You're still here?

332
00:25:39,412 --> 00:25:41,081
Don't you have any shame?

333
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:45,502
You're already overstaying
your welcome, Mercy.

334
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,337
This is our last day here.

335
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,923
Can you really not let it slide
just this one time?

336
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:51,925
- Mother, stop it.
- Mother!

337
00:25:52,008 --> 00:25:53,593
- That's enough.
- Mother.

338
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,638
- Mother! Mother!
- You're all animals! You're insulting us!

339
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:57,722
- Mother!
- Do something!

340
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,934
- Mother. Mother, stop it.
- Mother!

341
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,061
You just--

342
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,438
- Mother, stop it.
- Stop it.

343
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:08,024
- Just for tonight--
- I said stop it! What's wrong with you?

344
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:09,109
- Stop it!
- Mother!

345
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,403
- Mother, that's enough.
- Stop it.

346
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,155
- Your mother started it.
- Let her go!

347
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:16,533
You're all nuisances!
What's wrong with you?!

348
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:20,620
- That's enough, please.
- You've brought us nothing but shame.

349
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,497
- Mother, that's enough!
- That's enough!

350
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,873
- Stop it!
- Your mother started it.

351
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,792
I said enough. You're just making trouble.

352
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:28,628
- Auntie.
- What's with you?

353
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,171
- Stop it!
- That's enough.

354
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,214
Mother.

355
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:33,758
- Mother!
- Let go of me!

356
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,844
Hey, you uneducated people!

357
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:42,976
You uneducated people!
You have no respect for my family!

358
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,646
And you!

359
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:49,649
Why are you still here?

360
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:56,906
All of you, get out of my house!

361
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,451
We will leave! Tomorrow!

362
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,703
Tomorrow? What do you mean tomorrow?

363
00:27:01,786 --> 00:27:03,621
Leave now!

364
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:07,125
I won't leave
until I say goodbye to my husband.

365
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,545
Fine.

366
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,839
So you want to say goodbye?

367
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:16,176
Ma'am! Ma'am Aurora!
That's enough, ma'am! Ma'am!

368
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,345
Ma'am Aurora, stop it, ma'am!
That's enough, ma'am!

369
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:22,140
Say goodbye to the person you killed!

370
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,308
Come here!

371
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:25,643
There!

372
00:27:27,812 --> 00:27:29,606
There!

373
00:27:30,732 --> 00:27:32,859
Say your goodbyes, Sam.

374
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,070
Now! Now!

375
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,279
Do it!

376
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,157
Back off!

377
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:48,375
Be thankful my mother taught me
to respect others.

378
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:51,044
That's why I can still respect you.

379
00:27:51,127 --> 00:27:54,756
Because if she hadn't,
that's not all I'd have done to you.

380
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:02,389
Come back here!

381
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:04,641
Come back here, you evil woman.

382
00:28:19,781 --> 00:28:21,908
Let go of me.

383
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,841
Goodbye…

384
00:28:39,134 --> 00:28:40,927
Paco.

385
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:23,112
Sergeant Major Casas, why are you here?

386
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:27,909
Well, I was going to return
the personal effects of Mr. Palacios.

387
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,538
And I came to see you.

388
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,250
I want to talk to you.

389
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,294
The investigation is over, right?

390
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,004
George, come on.

391
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:47,428
You know what I'm talking about.

392
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:51,641
It's about us.

393
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:59,399
George, you left me
without any explanation.

394
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:05,738
Is this what you wanted?

395
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:09,617
To marry a rich guy?

396
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,749
I have nothing to explain to you, Abdul.

397
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,839
Are you happy?

398
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:26,676
Are you happy with your decision?

399
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:30,054
Of course, I'm happy.

400
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:33,182
I have achieved all my dreams in life.

401
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:15,725
Paco…

402
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:46,232
Sam, we'll never come back to this place.

403
00:33:46,315 --> 00:33:49,777
Never! I despise this house so much!

404
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:56,075
You can go ahead.

405
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,036
I'll follow.

406
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,288
Let's go, Mother.

407
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:26,981
Sam!

408
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,359
Sam, wait for me!

409
00:34:32,487 --> 00:34:33,988
Sam!

410
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,282
Sam! Sam!

411
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,117
Sam, I saw Paco.

412
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,911
I saw him.

413
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:42,663
Have you seen him too?

414
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:44,290
Did he show himself to you?

415
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,584
No.

416
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:49,420
Sam, his soul is restless, Sam…

417
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,547
because he was killed.

418
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:53,883
Someone killed him.

419
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:57,804
He needs our help, Sam.

420
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:03,684
Don't go.

421
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,353
Please.

422
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,563
Sam, don't go.

423
00:35:08,022 --> 00:35:08,856
Please.

424
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:09,774
Ma'am Rebecca!

425
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,859
Sam, please. Please.

426
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,861
You have to believe me. I saw Paco.

427
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,656
- I pitied what Paco looked like.
- Ma'am Rebecca!

428
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:18,825
- Sam, please listen to me.
- Ma'am Rebecca!

429
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,535
Paco needs our help.

430
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:21,744
He needs our help, Sam.

431
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,372
- Ma'am Rebecca, let's go.
- I pity Paco.

432
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,499
No! Paco needs our help.

433
00:35:26,582 --> 00:35:28,000
- Let's go. Let's go.
- No!

434
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,794
- Let's go!
- Sam!

435
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,421
No! Sam!

436
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:34,340
Sam!

437
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,578
Tell me the truth.

438
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,080
I did not kill Dr. Orly.

439
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,373
No one did!

440
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:10,001
Because your father killed himself.

441
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:14,630
I gave you a chance to explain yourself.

442
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:15,590
- Sam…
- I let it slide.

443
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,217
Sam, you don't know your father!

444
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,303
He took advantage of the miners.

445
00:36:21,762 --> 00:36:26,184
He got money from them
just to sustain his own addiction.

446
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,394
You're so shameless!

447
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,521
Just to defend yourself,

448
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:32,356
you will destroy my father's memory?!

449
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,318
- You're so shameless!
- Sam, I'm telling the truth!

450
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,778
Your father was a bad person!

451
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,697
He was hiding a lot of things from you!

452
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:40,907
He was a liar!

453
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:43,159
It's you! You're the liar!
You and your mother!

454
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:45,119
- Sam!
- You're the ones who are lying!

455
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,495
Your family is hiding a lot of things.

456
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,206
Sam, don't twist things back on us!

457
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,957
I don't have to do that.

458
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,169
I know what I heard!

459
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:55,546
Yes.

460
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,715
That your mother has been
defending you for a long time.

461
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,675
That your family has been covering for you
for quite some time.

462
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,930
You killed my father!

463
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,528
Sam.

464
00:37:20,279 --> 00:37:21,239
Sam.

465
00:37:27,286 --> 00:37:28,412
Sam…

466
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:33,960
I already know everything
just by seeing your face.

467
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:36,754
- We're over. It's over between us.
- Sam, no! Sam, no!

468
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:39,215
- We're done!
- Sam! Sam, no!

469
00:37:39,298 --> 00:37:42,593
I can't have you arrested now
because I have no evidence,

470
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:44,762
but I will leak this to the press
and social media.

471
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,097
- I will destroy you!
- Don't do that!

472
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,431
Don't do that or I will commit suicide!

473
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,225
- I will kill myself.
- Go ahead and commit suicide!

474
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:50,685
I don't care!

475
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:52,103
You don't believe me?

476
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:53,896
I'll show you! I'm doing this.

477
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,564
I will jump and I'll take you with me!

478
00:37:55,648 --> 00:37:56,440
Come on!

479
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:57,900
Let me go!

480
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:35,896
Finally, the Castillos will be gone!

481
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,399
Yes, sir!

482
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:47,241
George…

483
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:49,660
What is it?

484
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:54,790
George…

485
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,959
What's the problem?

486
00:38:58,210 --> 00:39:00,212
Mother, I saw Abdul.

487
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,797
He was nagging me.

488
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:04,383
He wants us to talk about
what happened to us before.

489
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:08,679
Oh, why are you reacting that way?

490
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:12,892
George…

491
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:15,519
don't tell me you still feel something

492
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,563
for Abdul?

493
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,861
George, you and Abdul
have been done for a long time.

494
00:39:23,944 --> 00:39:25,821
Forget about him.

495
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,992
Your life is better now.

496
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,245
You're so lucky with Basil.

497
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:38,626
You're right, Mother.

498
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,252
I have a perfect life now.

499
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,589
There's nothing more I could ask for
with Basil.

500
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:47,551
I love him so much, and he loves me.

501
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:49,720
That's right!

502
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,556
So, are you okay now?

503
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,267
We can now continue our celebration

504
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,103
because the Castillos are gone!

505
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,105
Can we? Okay!

506
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:04,193
Let's go and dance!

507
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:08,239
Yes!

508
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:10,699
- Hey, get the wine!
- Wine!

509
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:14,120
- What kind of celebration has no wine?
- Faster. Let's celebrate with wine!

510
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:21,293
Hurry up, Ward! Hurry!

511
00:40:21,377 --> 00:40:22,711
What's taking you so long?

512
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:23,879
There you go.

513
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,423
There should be wine.

514
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,758
- Yeah!
- Of course, there.

515
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,722
Yes!

516
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:36,851
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

517
00:40:37,977 --> 00:40:39,228
Goodbye, Sam!

518
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,648
- Goodbye, Castillos!
- Goodbye, Castillos!

519
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:50,030
Aurora…

520
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:55,703
Leave me alone, Galvan!

521
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:57,830
That's enough.

522
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:16,765
<i>The National Police Force has released</i>
<i>the results of the initial investigation</i>

523
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:21,145
<i>into the death of the COO</i>
<i>of Golden Palacios Mining Corporation,</i>

524
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,230
<i>Mr. Paco Palacios.</i>

525
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:27,651
<i>According to Sergeant Abdul Casas,</i>
<i>the lead investigator,</i>

526
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:31,030
<i>the fall of Mr. Palacios from the cliff</i>
<i>was an accident.</i>

527
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:32,698
Shut up!

528
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,205
Shut up!

529
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:43,334
No! No!

530
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:05,022
Sam, my child?

531
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:06,732
Sam, what's wrong?

532
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:08,943
What is it?

533
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:16,367
Nothing.

534
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,289
I'll follow you in a bit.

535
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:25,668
Okay, we'll wait for you.

536
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:33,592
Hello?

537
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:36,095
<i>I know what happened.</i>

538
00:42:42,184 --> 00:42:43,811
Who is this?

539
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:47,356
What are you talking about?

540
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,441
<i>Look at the bridge.</i>

541
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:07,376
Just a little chat.

542
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,086
Or else…

543
00:43:09,169 --> 00:43:12,798
everybody will know what happened to Paco?

544
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,626
What do you want to talk about?

545
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,838
My cousin's death.

546
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,800
Paco committed suicide.

547
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,845
Did he?

548
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:03,140
I don't know what your deal is

549
00:44:03,223 --> 00:44:05,476
but I don't have time for this.

550
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,230
You pushed him.

551
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,028
No.

552
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,781
Yes, you did.

553
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,532
I was there.

554
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:21,909
I witnessed it.

555
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:31,627
<i>It's not true that I called Paco</i>
<i>and he was crying.</i>

556
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:33,837
<i>It was still early when I called.</i>

557
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:37,508
<i>In fact, we'd said that</i>
<i>we'd meet each other at around twelve.</i>

558
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,509
<i>Midnight.</i>

559
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,306
<i>I was on my way to him, and</i>

560
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:45,808
<i>I saw him on the cliff.</i>

561
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,060
<i>He was restless.</i>

562
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,023
<i>I was about to approach Paco, but then…</i>

563
00:44:53,107 --> 00:44:54,525
<i>I saw you.</i>

564
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:08,831
So, I took my phone out
and took a video of you guys.

565
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,085
<i>You know, for entertainment purposes.</i>

566
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:17,423
But then…

567
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,067
Sam…

568
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,780
Do you want to see it?

569
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,533
Here.

570
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:46,827
Go on.

571
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,637
Sorry.

572
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:08,056
I'm sorry.

573
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:11,727
I didn't mean to. It was an accident.

574
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,229
- I didn't…
- Yeah?

575
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,939
Accident?

576
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:19,818
It doesn't look like an accident.

577
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,614
In fact, no one who sees this,

578
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,449
who watches this video,

579
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,868
will believe you.

580
00:46:32,331 --> 00:46:34,208
Relax, Sam, stop crying.

581
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,709
Okay?

582
00:46:35,792 --> 00:46:37,794
I will not leak the video…

583
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:42,591
but I need something in return.

584
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:46,553
Basil, I don't have money.

585
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:52,643
But okay, if you want, I will give you
everything I inherit from Paco.

586
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:56,605
- You can have it all. Everything.
- Sam, please, don't insult me.

587
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,900
I'm rich. I have a lot of money.

588
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,404
What do you want in return?

589
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:09,159
I want you to kill someone for me.

590
00:47:10,744 --> 00:47:12,204
What?

591
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,641
Who?

592
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:37,271
A person who is an obstacle in my life.

593
00:47:39,856 --> 00:47:41,358
Is it Ma'am Aurora?

594
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:54,454
Do you want me to kill Ma'am Aurora?

595
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:07,759
Can you imagine?

596
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:12,180
They haven't even been here for a year,
and yet they're being evicted already.

597
00:48:12,264 --> 00:48:13,557
That's what you call karma.

598
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,933
That's right!

599
00:48:15,601 --> 00:48:18,103
But you know, that's okay

600
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,479
because from now on,

601
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:24,818
you're the one and only princess
in this castle.

602
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:28,530
And Basil is my one and only
Prince Charming.

603
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:29,531
- That's right.
- Cheers!

604
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,699
George is amazing.

605
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,035
I know, right?

606
00:48:35,912 --> 00:48:37,623
No, no, no.

607
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:41,209
I can't kill Ma'am Aurora.
I'm not a killer.

608
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,919
Sam, yes, you are a killer.

609
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,340
You even killed your husband.
Why not your mother-in-law?

610
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,633
Take it back.

611
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,718
But don't worry.

612
00:48:51,261 --> 00:48:52,763
It's not Auntie Aurora.

613
00:48:54,181 --> 00:48:55,265
Then who?

614
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,019
Your best friend.

615
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,189
George?

616
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:17,371
I want you to kill my wife.

617
00:49:30,884 --> 00:49:35,722
You should be the best possible wife
so he can't live without you.

618
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:38,350
I'm sick and tired of George,

619
00:49:38,433 --> 00:49:41,144
and I want her out of my life,
preferably dead.

620
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:43,355
- I am not a killer!
- Yes, you are!

621
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,816
<i>Do you want everyone to know</i>
<i>that you killed Paco?</i>

622
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:46,942
<i>You can't leave.</i>

623
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,318
Are you running from something, Sam?

624
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,903
- Sam, can't leave.
- What?

625
00:49:49,986 --> 00:49:52,906
<i>She's set to inherit</i>
<i>her husband's company shares.</i>

626
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:56,410
We need those to make sure
of Basil's ascension to the company,

627
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,831
<i>or else Aurora will still manage</i>
<i>Palacios Mining.</i>

628
00:50:00,914 --> 00:50:02,374
<i>I'm here for you.</i>

629
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:03,917
<i>If it means he'll come back to life,</i>

630
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,045
I will love you as my own daughter.

631
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,339
<i>I have good news. I did it!</i>

632
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:11,007
<i>Well, I told you I'd get everything.</i>

633
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,802
<i>What do you do with something</i>
<i>you have no more use for?</i>

634
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:15,887
<i>You discard it, right?</i>
<i>You throw it away.</i>

635
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:17,681
