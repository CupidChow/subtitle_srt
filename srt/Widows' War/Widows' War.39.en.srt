1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,434
<i>Sam said Basil blackmailed her.</i>

2
00:00:17,517 --> 00:00:22,188
<i>Apparently, Basil witnessed Sam</i>
<i>pushing Paco off the cliff.</i>

3
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,982
- To do what?
- To kill me.

4
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,692
- What?
- Is that true, Iñigo?

5
00:00:25,775 --> 00:00:27,402
<i>Your wife is just barren.</i>

6
00:00:27,485 --> 00:00:29,029
She didn't have an affair.

7
00:00:29,112 --> 00:00:30,238
She's not a criminal.

8
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:32,782
So, please. Think about this.
You don't need to have her killed.

9
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:34,159
She lied to me.

10
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:37,328
Basil will never ever think
of killing you.

11
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:43,042
Your grandchild will be safe
only if George dies.

12
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,252
<i>Where is George now?</i>

13
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:47,756
<i>I don't know and I don't care.</i>

14
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:49,591
Bill, what happened to you?

15
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:51,551
PREVIOUSLY

16
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,386
<i>Paco?</i>

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,680
Where are you, Paco?

18
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,850
Paco! Where are you, Paco?

19
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,687
Help.

20
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,571
Paco, I've been looking for you.

21
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:13,031
Where have you been?

22
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:15,700
I was just outside the door.

23
00:01:15,784 --> 00:01:17,994
The Palacios killer attacked again.

24
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:20,288
And who was the victim?

25
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,623
It was George.

26
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,208
Did you see who attacked you?

27
00:01:23,291 --> 00:01:25,502
Yes. But, I can't describe

28
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,588
the height and build because it was dark.

29
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,048
Did something happen before this?

30
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:33,384
Maybe we can get a lead,
or any possible suspect?

31
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,636
It could be Sam.

32
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,763
George almost ran her over
the other night.

33
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:38,223
Maybe she's retaliating.

34
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,849
Oh, my God. My God,
it's getting too dangerous here.

35
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,768
We need to get out of here.

36
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:43,853
You can leave if you want.

37
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,439
But not you, Samantha.

38
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,733
You are not leaving.

39
00:01:48,817 --> 00:01:50,360
We came here as a complete family,

40
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,986
and we will leave together as well.

41
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,114
I don't think you heard me.

42
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:59,786
You are not leaving, Samantha.

43
00:02:00,495 --> 00:02:01,538
Francis.

44
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:06,584
Go ahead and shoot.

45
00:02:07,293 --> 00:02:08,878
Kill your own grandchild.

46
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:14,759
It seems you've suddenly
become brave, Samantha.

47
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,386
Where did that come from?

48
00:02:17,053 --> 00:02:18,471
From my child.

49
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,099
He is already growing in my womb,

50
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,184
and he needs a brave mother

51
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:25,812
who will protect him from the killer…

52
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,063
and from you.

53
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,481
How dare you.

54
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:30,150
How dare you, too.

55
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:32,527
What?

56
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:34,404
Are you going to shoot?

57
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,906
Because we're leaving now.

58
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,033
Don't dare me, Samantha.

59
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,451
I dare you.

60
00:02:59,053 --> 00:03:00,430
Can we go now?

61
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:03,224
You won, Samantha.

62
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,729
Be thankful that my grandchild saved you.

63
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,734
Leave… but not tonight.

64
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:17,071
The Palacios killer
could still be out there.

65
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,408
Leave tomorrow.

66
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:22,368
And I want you…

67
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:25,747
to take all the garbage

68
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,541
you brought inside my house.

69
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,954
You're all stupid.

70
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,705
Useless.

71
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:08,957
There are a lot of you,

72
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,960
but none of you saw the Palacios killer.

73
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,089
Especially you,
you're the head of security.

74
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,548
I'm sorry, sir.

75
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:20,927
My grandchild almost died last night,

76
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,553
and all you can say is sorry?

77
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,597
You're fired.

78
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:32,105
Sam, will you put something in here?

79
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,565
- I'll close this.
- It's okay. Close it.

80
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,537
Sam…

81
00:04:52,792 --> 00:04:54,294
I'm really sorry, sir.

82
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,171
I'm doing my job properly.

83
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:59,841
If you're doing your job properly,

84
00:04:59,924 --> 00:05:02,010
why are we talking now?

85
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:03,761
Leave.

86
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:08,683
Now…

87
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,143
All of you…

88
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:15,398
Who wants to volunteer
to be the head of security?

89
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,235
No one?

90
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,778
You're all cowards.

91
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:22,613
You're useless.

92
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,959
You?

93
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:42,592
What are you doing here?

94
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,929
I assure you we're not taking any garbage

95
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:48,931
from your house.

96
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:51,100
Sam…

97
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,606
Don't waste your tears.

98
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,401
You've used that trick on me before.

99
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:02,528
It will never work again.

100
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,864
Sam…

101
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,909
Sam…

102
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,244
I'm begging you.

103
00:06:10,328 --> 00:06:13,289
I'm begging you. Don't leave, please.

104
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,791
Don't leave, please.

105
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:17,126
Don't take my grandchild
away from me, please.

106
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,128
I'm begging you, please.

107
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,547
Please, please, please.

108
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,758
Mom…

109
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,353
You're right.

110
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:40,399
Why do I even bother?

111
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:48,491
I came to give you a farewell gift.

112
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,505
My gift for my grandchild.

113
00:07:16,727 --> 00:07:18,855
You're taking away my temper.

114
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,524
I didn't know that you're a comedian.

115
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,443
I am serious.

116
00:07:24,068 --> 00:07:27,155
I want to protect the Palacioses.
My family.

117
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,616
My family?

118
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,577
Our family.

119
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,579
Don't include yourself.

120
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,832
I want to protect the Palacioses.

121
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,960
Especially those who are still
in the womb.

122
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,879
They can't protect themselves.

123
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:47,425
What do you know about protecting people?

124
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,802
You're just a helper.

125
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,721
I'm not just a helper.

126
00:07:51,804 --> 00:07:53,723
- I am a former…
- A former what?

127
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,485
Go on. Take it.

128
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:07,778
Transfer it to your name.

129
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:10,239
I'll sign the papers, Sam.

130
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,339
Thank you.

131
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,008
I'm glad you accepted it.

132
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,887
Why not?

133
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,598
I can sell this.

134
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:36,599
What?

135
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,771
You're a former what? Answer.

136
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,649
Community guard.

137
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:47,443
See?

138
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,904
You really are a comedian.

139
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,199
Please agree.

140
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:55,785
I want to protect the Palacioses.

141
00:08:56,744 --> 00:08:58,287
And why would I agree?

142
00:08:58,913 --> 00:09:01,207
Why would I trust you?

143
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,543
Maybe you're the killer.

144
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,003
I'm not a killer.

145
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,880
I am also a Palacios.

146
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,799
I couldn't kill my family.

147
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,884
You're only a Palacios
because of the Palacios blood

148
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,678
in your veins.

149
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,471
But, it ends there.

150
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,265
I don't know you.

151
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,059
I don't know how you were raised.

152
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,645
You are a total stranger to me.

153
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,735
I know what you're doing.

154
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:32,905
You're giving us this property

155
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,409
so you can come to us anytime you want.

156
00:09:37,618 --> 00:09:38,911
Let me tell you.

157
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,998
When I get out of this hell,

158
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:45,751
you will never see me again.

159
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:49,046
Don't be so sure, Samantha.

160
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,257
I still cannot condone
what you did to my son

161
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:55,261
by pushing him off the cliff.

162
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:59,265
You will still see me in court.

163
00:10:00,224 --> 00:10:01,809
That's right.

164
00:10:01,892 --> 00:10:03,936
In court, yes.

165
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,397
But, in other places…

166
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,358
never…

167
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:12,945
because I will leave you.

168
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,823
I will stay away from you

169
00:10:15,906 --> 00:10:18,117
because I don't want to see you,

170
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,454
feel you, smell you.

171
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,379
Don't speak too soon, Samantha.

172
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,675
The world is small.

173
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:37,553
We will still see each other.

174
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,389
Right.

175
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:42,933
The world is small.

176
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,562
But, in mine and my child's world,

177
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,941
you will never exist.

178
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,863
Francis, hurry up.

179
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:19,345
I've accepted that you
and Ma'am Aurora can't accept me,

180
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:23,808
but I will protect Sofia,
Ma'am Sam, and Ma'am George.

181
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:24,975
Maybe all of them…

182
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,811
can accept me.

183
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,857
I will not allow Sofia to accept you.

184
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,528
And George, after what you did to her,

185
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:37,238
will she accept you?

186
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:41,242
There's only one person
you've fooled to accept you,

187
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:42,618
and that's Rebecca,

188
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:44,412
who you took away from me.

189
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:47,123
Took away?

190
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,749
You didn't know?

191
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,377
Your sister sent her
to the mental facility.

192
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:53,337
What?

193
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:56,215
Aurora…

194
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,013
Aurora.

195
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:18,737
No one has ever made me angry like this.

196
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,406
Only Samantha.

197
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,001
Sir Galvan, calm down.

198
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,253
Give me the gun.

199
00:12:34,336 --> 00:12:35,671
Don't meddle.

200
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:38,591
Aurora.

201
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,691
How dare you disturb me, Galvan.

202
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,359
Can't you see?

203
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:59,778
I'm releasing my anger.

204
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,697
All right.

205
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,282
Let's release our anger.

206
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,535
Why did you send Rebecca to the facility?

207
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:09,997
Francis, is everything complete?

208
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,207
Yes, Sam. Everything is complete.

209
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:12,458
Are you sure we didn't leave
anything behind?

210
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,126
I don't think we left anything.

211
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,882
Sadly… you're now leaving.

212
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,928
But, it's better,
so you won't get stressed.

213
00:13:24,595 --> 00:13:27,223
Especially Ma'am Sam.
They're gossiping about her again.

214
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,976
Is it still about Paco?

215
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,561
There's something new.

216
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,938
The Balays said

217
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,441
you're the Palacios killer,
or the mastermind.

218
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,609
What?

219
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,654
Who is accusing her?

220
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:44,156
Sir Galvan and Ma'am George.

221
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,116
That's what Cairo said.

222
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,453
That woman won't stop picking on me.

223
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,538
Sam.

224
00:13:58,837 --> 00:14:00,506
She needs rest.

225
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,384
Of all places, you would put her there?

226
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:06,095
Because that's where she will get better.

227
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,722
Rebecca is getting worse, Galvan.

228
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,684
She attacked me with the katana.

229
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:12,768
Would you believe?

230
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,770
She almost killed me.

231
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,274
Oh, come on, Aurora.

232
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:20,985
Rebecca wouldn't kill someone.

233
00:14:21,068 --> 00:14:21,944
It's true, Sir Galvan.

234
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:25,281
Our niece is going crazy, Galvan.

235
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,242
She's uncontrollable.

236
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,411
What do you want?

237
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,163
Do you want her to attack George,

238
00:14:33,247 --> 00:14:35,040
and kill your grandchild?

239
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:38,127
Of course not.

240
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:39,545
Then…

241
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,257
are we done arguing?

242
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,717
Yes.

243
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,386
And Rebecca stays in the facility.

244
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,138
Good.

245
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:50,639
Rebecca is not crazy.

246
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:58,981
- Don't.
- Mother, no.

247
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:01,442
- Just let them be.
- They're pissing me off, Mother.

248
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:02,735
- Don't. Just let them be.
- Sam…

249
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,404
All they do is talk.
They don't have proof.

250
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,947
Sam, just let them be.

251
00:15:07,031 --> 00:15:09,241
They're just looking for someone to blame.

252
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,994
They're pitiful. The killer attacked them.

253
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:16,373
Don't waste your time on them.

254
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,543
Let's leave all the people
who have hurt us, Sam.

255
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,345
I will not miss this house.

256
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,142
You sent Rebecca to the mental facility

257
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,353
because she found out
that you gave away her children.

258
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,980
What are you talking about?

259
00:15:40,064 --> 00:15:41,482
Rebecca has no children.

260
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,984
You're also crazy.

261
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:45,653
You're like your sister.

262
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,404
It's you who is crazy.

263
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:50,741
You're crazier than Rebecca.

264
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,619
It's you who should be sent
to a mental facility.

265
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,624
Amando.

266
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:02,378
Get rid of this trash.

267
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,923
Stop meddling, Jericho.

268
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,300
Let me go.

269
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,760
I can walk by myself.

270
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,057
Galvan.

271
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,435
I'm getting pissed with that bastard.

272
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:21,981
Don't mind him. He's nobody to us.

273
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:25,150
Why are you so hot-headed?

274
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,653
You've been throwing tantrums
for a while now.

275
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:31,615
It's Samantha. They are leaving.

276
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,450
You let her?

277
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:37,246
I tried to stop her, but she's stubborn.

278
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:41,000
She would rather die than live here.

279
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:47,464
So, you don't have a grandchild anymore.

280
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:51,677
Don't be too excited, Galvan.

281
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,389
As long as Sam is alive,
I still have a grandchild.

282
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,517
But, she has already left you.

283
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:05,399
There's nowhere she can hide
where I can't find her.

284
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,174
What's taking your sister
so long? Go and fetch her.

285
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,759
It will rain soon.

286
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,135
Okay, Mother. I'll go to her.

287
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,274
Sam. Sam.

288
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,574
Sam?

289
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:58,786
Cairo, have you seen Sam?

290
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:00,746
No.

291
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:05,000
Mother. Mother, it's Sam.

292
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:09,004
Sam.

293
00:18:09,546 --> 00:18:10,714
Let's go on a staycation.

294
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,592
Look, there are a lot of beautiful places.

295
00:18:13,675 --> 00:18:16,845
I want you to stay in the hotel
for the meantime.

296
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,555
You're safer there.

297
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,641
That is if you want to.

298
00:18:20,724 --> 00:18:22,935
I love it. Let's go, George.

299
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,437
I'll think about it, Dad.

300
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,201
Cairo…

301
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:41,286
Where are you going?

302
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,665
Sir, I'll help out in searching for Sam.

303
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:47,209
Why are you searching for Sam?

304
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:50,587
She is missing. Someone took her.

305
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,214
- What?
- What?

306
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,395
Ma'am Aurora.

307
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,316
Why are you still here?

308
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:14,736
Did Sam change her mind? Will you stay?

309
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,196
Don't pretend.

310
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,406
Where is Sam?

311
00:19:18,031 --> 00:19:19,324
Why are you looking for her here?

312
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,285
Aren't you together?

313
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,871
Because you had her abducted.

314
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:27,457
Don't you dare accuse me, Mercy.

315
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,169
I didn't have your daughter abducted.

316
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:37,509
How was she abducted? Where?

317
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,179
On the grounds.

318
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,347
They were about to leave
when she went missing.

319
00:19:42,431 --> 00:19:44,141
Excuse me, sir, ma'am.

320
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,934
Just go.

321
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,357
You're concerned for Sam?

322
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,944
Yes, George. Why are you so concerned?

323
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,866
Someone was abducted here on the estate.

324
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:03,702
Whether it was Sam
or anyone else, that's alarming.

325
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,662
It's really dangerous here on the estate.

326
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,832
That's why I want you
to stay in the hotel.

327
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:10,959
That's right, George.

328
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,669
First of all, there's nothing we can do

329
00:20:12,753 --> 00:20:14,254
about what happened to Sam.

330
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,048
We have nothing to do with that.

331
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,967
What's important is
that we're not the ones being abducted.

332
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,222
Dad, do you have something to do with it?

333
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:30,771
You are the only one who could abduct Sam.

334
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:33,065
Really, Mercy?

335
00:20:33,148 --> 00:20:34,274
Do you have amnesia,

336
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:38,362
or are you just stupid?

337
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,113
There's a Palacios killer.

338
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,789
Amando…

339
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,625
Order all the people on the estate.

340
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:54,670
Tell them to look for Sam.

341
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,172
Also, call Sergeant Royales.

342
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:02,427
I have nothing to do with it, George.

343
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:04,930
Why does it seem like you're happy?

344
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:09,393
That means there will be no competition.

345
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,561
Competition?

346
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:15,107
If Sam is gone, so is her baby.

347
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:19,903
There will be no rival
for Sofia, and my grandchild.

348
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,124
Stop pretending

349
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:34,835
because we're sure
that it was you who had Sam abducted.

350
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,422
Will I be this concerned, Francis,

351
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:40,799
if I had your sister abducted?

352
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:42,968
I'm worried for my grandchild.

353
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:45,679
And in the first place,

354
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,098
weren't you together?

355
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,059
Why did you let her be abducted?

356
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,026
You're a neglectful mother, Mercy.

357
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:03,488
Aren't you ashamed
to call yourself a mother?

358
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,741
If something happens to my grandchild,

359
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,701
you should be ready for me.

360
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:08,869
My mother is not neglectful.

361
00:22:08,952 --> 00:22:10,746
You too.

362
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,415
You should be protecting your sister.

363
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,376
You're a useless brother.

364
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,962
Yes.

365
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,965
It was my fault, Ma'am Aurora.

366
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,633
Please help us find her.

367
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,135
Mother, why are you asking her for help?

368
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,597
And who will help you, Francis?

369
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,896
What the hell are you looking at?

370
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:37,898
Okay.

371
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:39,733
If it was not you who abducted Sam,

372
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:40,859
who would do it?

373
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,198
If it's not the Palacios killer…

374
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:51,536
I still have two people in mind
who could possibly have done it.

375
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,247
Who?

376
00:23:41,795 --> 00:23:43,088
Based on your description,

377
00:23:43,171 --> 00:23:45,674
those are the possible matches
for the gas mask

378
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:47,300
worn by the Palacios killer.

379
00:23:47,384 --> 00:23:48,718
It's not here, Detective.

380
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,973
Okay, I've asked them to search
for some more.

381
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,063
Detective, any update about the case?

382
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:00,981
Which one?

383
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:03,400
The attack on Ms. Georgina,

384
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:05,110
or the abduction of Ms. Samantha?

385
00:24:05,694 --> 00:24:07,863
I don't care about Sam's case.

386
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,115
Because you know where she is.

387
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:33,597
Where am I?

388
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,600
Mother?

389
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:40,270
Francis?

390
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,440
Where am I?

391
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:51,072
Aurora, I didn't have Sam abducted.

392
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,658
You have a motive and so does George.

393
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,076
You want Sam gone

394
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:58,955
so Sofia and George's child
won't have a rival.

395
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,707
Why would I be involved?

396
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,334
I have nothing to do with this.

397
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,085
And why would I have her abducted?

398
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:07,130
Because you think that the Palacios killer

399
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:08,882
who attacked you is Sam.

400
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,717
You want revenge.

401
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,594
Wait a second, Ma'am Aurora.
What's your problem?

402
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,304
Shut up, Ruth.

403
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:16,890
Release Sam.

404
00:25:17,474 --> 00:25:19,684
Help. Help.

405
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,353
Help me.

406
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,940
Mother. Francis.

407
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:27,984
Help me.

408
00:25:37,535 --> 00:25:38,912
Aurora…

409
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,039
Stop pointing fingers at us.

410
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,040
No.

411
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:45,669
Not as long as
Sam and my grandchild are missing. Never.

412
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:47,629
Stop pointing fingers at others.

413
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,257
A lot of problems have happened here.

414
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,759
Mr. Palacios, Mrs. Palacios,

415
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,178
it's too dangerous here on the estate.

416
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,264
Have you considered transferring?

417
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,060
We already talked about this, remember?

418
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,605
No one can know you're here.

419
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:07,941
Not now.

420
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,567
Not yet.

421
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:11,987
But, until when?

422
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,740
Until when will I hide here?

423
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:21,162
You'll be free, Paco,
before your baby comes.

424
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:23,540
I promise you that, Paco.

425
00:26:24,374 --> 00:26:28,336
You will see your child, okay?

426
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,547
No.

427
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:32,173
No.

428
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:33,967
I'm not leaving my house.

429
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,929
Detective, do you think
that if we transfer,

430
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:39,639
the killer will not follow us?

431
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,475
- All I'm saying is--
- No.

432
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:47,480
Galvan, I'm giving you until tomorrow.

433
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:50,066
If you don't release Sam,

434
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,485
we'll end up killing each other.

435
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:09,002
Mother. Francis.

436
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:10,086
Open the door.

437
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,213
Let me out of here.

438
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,674
Mother. Oh, my God.

439
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:17,177
How can I open the door?

440
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:21,348
Mother. Francis. Help.

441
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,390
Help…

442
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,100
Hello, Sam.

443
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:28,521
Did I scare you?

444
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,024
You?

445
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:33,234
Welcome to your new home.

446
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,737
You fool. Why did you lock me up here?

447
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,030
You fool.

448
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:08,395
Team Bravo…

449
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,941
check everything, and search the area
around the mansion, okay?

450
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,983
Yes, sir.

451
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,443
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

452
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:16,986
All right.

453
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:22,659
Team Charlie, did you check
all of the estates' exits and entrances?

454
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,083
Okay, Team Delta, any leads?

455
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:40,719
Bro, what's your problem?

456
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:00,280
Good morning, sleeping beauty.

457
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,490
I brought you food.

458
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,375
It seems that you are in a deep sleep.

459
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,335
Well…

460
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:18,673
This is way, way better
than sleeping pills.

461
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,341
Right, Sam?

462
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,204
I'm mad at you

463
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:52,582
because you were one
of the reasons I was jailed.

464
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:57,212
But, I need your help.

465
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,797
What help?

466
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,090
To find Sam in the mansion.

467
00:30:02,801 --> 00:30:04,803
It was Ma'am Aurora who had Sam abducted.

468
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:07,013
Are you sure?

469
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:10,433
Not yet, but I'm observing her.

470
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,601
Her actions are different.

471
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:14,020
When Mother and I confronted her,

472
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,523
she wasn't surprised that Sam was missing.

473
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,942
She got mad right away.

474
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:20,151
It's obvious that she already knew.

475
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,653
Ma'am Aurora.

476
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,781
Why are you still here?

477
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,699
Did Sam change her mind?

478
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,201
Will you stay?

479
00:30:28,284 --> 00:30:29,744
Don't pretend.

480
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:30,870
Where is Sam?

481
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,831
Why are you looking for her here?

482
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,749
Aren't you together?

483
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:37,335
Because you had her abducted.

484
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:41,089
Don't you dare accuse me, Mercy.

485
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,633
I didn't have your daughter abducted.

486
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,885
And then when she confronted Sir Galvan,

487
00:30:46,594 --> 00:30:47,720
there was something different about her.

488
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,138
Her reaction was high.

489
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:51,224
It's like she was acting.

490
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:53,226
The attack on Ms. Georgina,

491
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:54,727
or the abduction of Ms. Samantha?

492
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,230
I don't care about Sam's case.

493
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,148
Because you know where she is.

494
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:03,903
Galvan, I'm giving you until tomorrow.

495
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,197
If you don't release Sam,

496
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,491
we'll end up killing each other.

497
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:13,204
Jericho, I know we're enemies,

498
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,206
- but maybe--
- I will help you.

499
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:18,793
Thank you.

500
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:27,510
Whatever you're planning,

501
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:29,387
don't push through with it.

502
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:09,052
But, Sarge…

503
00:32:09,135 --> 00:32:11,262
Francis, are you a police officer?

504
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:13,848
Sarge, I'm the brother
of the missing person.

505
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,433
Are you a police officer?

506
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,812
- No.
- There you go.

507
00:32:20,396 --> 00:32:21,940
Don't do our job.

508
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:28,029
Yes, Team Charlie?

509
00:32:31,407 --> 00:32:33,159
Let's look for Ma'am Sam.

510
00:32:41,084 --> 00:32:42,377
Hello?

511
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,087
Hey, handsome.

512
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:45,880
Hello?

513
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,591
Why are you not replying to my texts?

514
00:32:50,802 --> 00:32:51,886
Love life?

515
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:53,012
What?

516
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:55,139
Why did you only tell me now?

517
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,016
Okay, I'll go there now.

518
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,067
Hello? Hello? Hello?

519
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,986
- Can you hear me?
- Yes, I can hear you.

520
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:09,904
I'll search on the third floor,

521
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,447
or wherever there's a clue that shows

522
00:33:11,531 --> 00:33:13,199
where she's hiding Ma'am Sam.

523
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,660
And you follow Sir Amando, okay?

524
00:33:15,743 --> 00:33:16,577
All right.

525
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:25,545
There. He's here.

526
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:52,739
Okay, fine.

527
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,033
But, please reply to my text messages,

528
00:33:55,116 --> 00:33:56,784
so I know what's happening to you.

529
00:33:58,453 --> 00:34:00,204
Okay, take care. Bye.

530
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,460
God, you look so tense.

531
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,378
Who were you talking to?

532
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:08,379
It's George.

533
00:34:08,463 --> 00:34:10,631
She was attacked by the Palacios killer.

534
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:13,342
Oh, my God. What?

535
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,098
You know, Iñigo,

536
00:34:19,182 --> 00:34:21,017
it's okay to be concerned.

537
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:24,687
But, your reaction is too much.

538
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,938
George is okay, I suppose.

539
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,315
You were able to talk to her.

540
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:29,275
Her life was in danger.

541
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,778
I know.

542
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,906
But, you don't have to be
so concerned like a lover.

543
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,115
Just chill.

544
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,208
Wait…

545
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,086
Oh, my God.

546
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,413
He didn't go to his room.

547
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,792
Maybe he's going
to where they are hiding Sam.

548
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,293
<i>Keep your distance.</i>

549
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:30,461
Yes.

550
00:35:36,509 --> 00:35:38,136
Oh, my God.

551
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,680
Wait…

552
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,308
Are you falling for George?

553
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,692
You are.

554
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,236
What if I am, Bea?

555
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:23,723
Why are you following me?

556
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,311
I am not following you.

557
00:36:28,394 --> 00:36:30,521
I'm going to Sam's room.

558
00:36:32,273 --> 00:36:34,400
I just want to tell you
that Mother and I won't leave this place

559
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:36,194
until we find Sam.

560
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,533
Wait, wait, wait…

561
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:43,576
Wait.

562
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,871
Let's clear things up.

563
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,332
Aren't you gay?

564
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:53,419
I am not.

565
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,380
Basil was.

566
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,257
Wait…

567
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:40,967
But…

568
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,512
But, you were madly in love.

569
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,140
Basil…

570
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:54,105
was the only man I got involved with.

571
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:57,024
Before him, I had a lot of girlfriends.

572
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:01,195
I never felt for any other guy
aside from Basil.

573
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:03,656
And now…

574
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,326
you're falling for George?

575
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:09,870
For real?

576
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:33,936
<i>Jericho, Jericho…</i>

577
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,980
<i>I lost Sir Amando.</i>

578
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,815
<i>Are you in Ma'am Aurora's office?</i>

579
00:38:37,898 --> 00:38:38,899
Yes.

580
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:42,194
I came from her room.
But, I didn't find any clues.

581
00:38:43,154 --> 00:38:44,947
I'll check if I can find something here.

582
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,867
<i>Okay, I'm already near her office.</i>

583
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,619
<i>I'll guard the door. Be alert there.</i>

584
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,704
Okay.

585
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,837
Mother.

586
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,351
<i>Jericho, Ma'am Aurora is on her way.</i>

587
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,936
Okay, bro. Thank you.

588
00:42:07,816 --> 00:42:08,943
Hello?

589
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,362
Francis, she's not here anymore.

590
00:42:11,445 --> 00:42:13,322
<i>What? She hasn't come out yet.</i>

591
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,782
<i>Ma'am Aurora is still inside there.</i>

592
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:41,517
What? But, she's no longer here.

593
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,103
<i>How did that happen?</i>
<i>When I was looking at the door?</i>

594
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,981
But, she's not here anymore.
You can even come in here.

595
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:51,402
What's wrong, crying lady?

596
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,616
You're a demon. Let me go.

597
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,577
Why did you lock me up here?

598
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,329
To make sure you won't take away

599
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:04,582
my grandchild, Samantha.

600
00:43:04,665 --> 00:43:06,000
Don't worry.

601
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:07,376
You won't stay here long.

602
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,503
I will eventually release you

603
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,215
after you've given birth to my grandchild.

604
00:43:19,471 --> 00:43:20,598
Jericho.

605
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:27,855
She's not here.

606
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:29,648
But, how did it happen?
She hasn't come out yet.

607
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:31,275
What? She suddenly disappeared?

608
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:36,864
Could it be…

609
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:39,283
A secret room?

610
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,660
That's what I'm thinking.

611
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:47,207
You really are an animal.

612
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,835
A demon or an animal…

613
00:43:49,918 --> 00:43:51,629
What is it, Sam?

614
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,297
Make up your mind.

615
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:56,634
Relax, Samantha.

616
00:43:58,135 --> 00:43:59,845
You will enjoy it here

617
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:05,851
because you will be reunited
with your husband.

618
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,314
What?

619
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:11,940
You heard me.

620
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:18,155
You will be staying here with Paco.

621
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,701
You're going crazy.
What will you do to me?

622
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:24,495
Paco is dead.

623
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,458
That's what everybody thinks, Sam.

624
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,293
But, he's not.

625
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,587
Paco is alive.

626
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:36,215
Let me show you.

627
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:45,349
NEXT EPISODE

628
00:44:45,432 --> 00:44:46,266
It's dark here.

629
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:47,935
Where did Auntie Aurora go?

630
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:49,186
Maybe Sam is here.

631
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:53,524
- What's all this? TNT?
- That's dynamite.

632
00:44:53,607 --> 00:44:55,401
Help. Help.

633
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:57,903
Help me.

634
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,368
Could it be that Sam did that?

635
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:07,621
Remember, there was a fire
in their house before,

636
00:45:07,704 --> 00:45:09,706
and that was the start of our suffering.

637
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:10,958
Aurora…

638
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:11,917
Sir Galvan…
