1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,516
<i>If you're mad at me, confront me.</i>

2
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,809
<i>Why? What will you do, Sam?</i>

3
00:00:17,892 --> 00:00:19,394
<i>Will you also kill us?</i>

4
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,855
I pushed Paco by accident,

5
00:00:21,938 --> 00:00:24,023
and I did not kill your husband.

6
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:25,442
But, if it is for my family,

7
00:00:25,525 --> 00:00:27,569
I am willing to kill.

8
00:00:27,652 --> 00:00:28,737
<i>Sofia can stay,</i>

9
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,780
but you, you are trouble!

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:33,033
If you really don't want to marry me,

11
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:35,618
I will agree to this kind of setup.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:38,913
But, let me be of service to you.

13
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:41,207
Let me be your guide and support.

14
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,042
Please, just give Mommy a chance.

15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:44,753
Fine.

16
00:00:44,836 --> 00:00:47,380
If I were Auntie Aurora,
since you pushed my son,

17
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:49,466
I would not only kick you out,

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,259
I would have you jailed.

19
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:54,763
But, Ma'am Aurora is not
in her right mind.

20
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,016
That's why Sam is acting like a queen.

21
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,642
She's going to be a queen…

22
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:00,685
in the city jail.

23
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:03,313
<i>Iñigo and I will see each other today.</i>

24
00:01:03,396 --> 00:01:07,025
<i>We will discuss what charges</i>
<i>I can file against Sam</i>

25
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:09,360
<i>for threatening to run me over.</i>

26
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:12,947
‪PREVIOUSLY

27
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,491
<i>I will not leave this place</i>

28
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,993
because there's something I want
to find out from Mom Aurora.

29
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,704
- What's that, Sam?
- Her connection with Dad.

30
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:21,122
<i>With Orly?</i>

31
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,711
<i>There's only one person we know</i>
<i>who owns a Rubik's cube.</i>

32
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,588
<i>- Who?</i>
<i>- It's Sam.</i>

33
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,340
What do you plan to do now?

34
00:01:30,423 --> 00:01:32,091
I will teach her a lesson.

35
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,761
<i>Before, I just let things slide.</i>
<i>But, now I won't.</i>

36
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:37,388
<i>My baby was almost put in danger here.</i>

37
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:38,973
<i>There's a commotion downstairs.</i>

38
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:42,894
It's Sir Galvan. He is planning
to send Ma'am Aurora to a mental facility.

39
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:44,354
She shouldn't leave this place.

40
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:47,649
You have to pass through me
before you can get to Ma'am Aurora.

41
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,110
I'm the head of this family. Do as I say.

42
00:01:50,693 --> 00:01:51,861
Do you really have to do this?

43
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,949
I'm just giving her
the proper that care she deserves.

44
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:58,868
What's all this commotion?

45
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:10,505
I hope Sam can stop them
from taking Ma'am Aurora to the hospital.

46
00:02:11,381 --> 00:02:13,007
She won't get well there.

47
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:16,052
What they're saying is that she'll just
get worse in the mental hospital.

48
00:02:16,845 --> 00:02:18,763
Ma'am Aurora needs help.

49
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,516
You saw how she was the other day?

50
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,644
It's like she has gone crazy.

51
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,568
I was resting in my room.

52
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,653
You were so noisy.

53
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:36,489
Mom…

54
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:38,616
You look…

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,660
What, Sam?

56
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:44,330
Is there something wrong…

57
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:45,832
with the way I look?

58
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:48,126
Oh, let me guess.

59
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:51,546
Is it the shoes?

60
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,465
Doesn't it match my outfit?

61
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,426
Sir…

62
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,344
Is she the patient?

63
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:01,806
She looks different from your description.

64
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,143
And who is she?

65
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:07,812
She's the doctor I got for you.

66
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:14,027
Your brother told me
that you're having a mental breakdown.

67
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,237
Me? When?

68
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,407
Do I look crazy to you, Doc?

69
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:21,534
Come on, Aurora.

70
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:23,328
Cut the drama.

71
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,746
You need help.

72
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,539
You're not in your right mind.

73
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,875
You even made your son a taxidermy.

74
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,502
What's wrong with that, Galvan?

75
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:36,841
I mean, I make my pets taxidermy
because I don't want to miss them.

76
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,510
Why can't I do that to my son?

77
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,764
It's not like…

78
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:45,642
I hurt anyone in the process.

79
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:50,230
It's better that we talk
in my clinic, Mrs. Palacios.

80
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:53,316
Mom, I'll go with you.

81
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:56,527
No, I can manage on my own, Sam.

82
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:58,029
Thank you.

83
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,031
And besides,

84
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:04,827
I have a good feeling that Doc
and I will get along.

85
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:06,120
Shall we?

86
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,705
Okay.

87
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,083
Excuse us.

88
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,722
Ma'am Aurora went with the people
from the mental facility, Attorney.

89
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:29,060
I hope you can find a way
for her to come home soon.

90
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:31,729
Thank you, Attorney.

91
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:37,652
How is Mom Aurora?

92
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:41,864
She should stay here

93
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:44,158
at home rather than in the hospital.

94
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:47,745
If a doctor is needed, they can come here.

95
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:49,330
Do you agree with me?

96
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:51,374
Why?

97
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,335
Why do you want Ma'am Aurora to be here?

98
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:57,839
Because it seems that there's something

99
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,465
she's not telling me about my father.

100
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:38,046
Are you crazy?

101
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:40,757
Are you really throwing
a Rubik's cube at me?

102
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,384
What if that hit my head?
What if I got hurt?

103
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,803
What do you think you are
doing to my family?

104
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,764
Do you want to kill me?

105
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:49,807
You tried to kill me first.

106
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,275
My child…

107
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:02,862
even if your daddy is gone,

108
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,823
I am here.

109
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:11,370
Remember this…

110
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,166
your Mommy is not weak.

111
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,585
I will fight for you.

112
00:06:19,796 --> 00:06:22,340
I won't allow others to hurt us…

113
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,094
Especially you.

114
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:41,067
Dr. Orly?

115
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:44,946
Last night she was crying,

116
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:46,489
and she mentioned Paco's name…

117
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:49,909
and my father's.

118
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:52,912
How close were they?

119
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:56,791
Dr. Orly was the resident doctor
in the mines.

120
00:06:56,874 --> 00:06:58,501
Ma'am Aurora was his boss.

121
00:06:58,584 --> 00:06:59,877
No.

122
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,630
With the tone of her voice,

123
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,883
it seemed like
they had a deeper relationship.

124
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,469
Paco also knew my father.

125
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:11,722
What did they have?

126
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,183
I don't know.

127
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:17,687
I injected Ma'am Aurora with a sedative.

128
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,064
Maybe that's why she said a lot of things

129
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,858
as a side effect.

130
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:27,280
So, you're saying
that Mom Aurora is crazy.

131
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:32,452
Amando, don't deny it anymore.

132
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,870
I know you know something.

133
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,205
I know you're hiding something.

134
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:40,042
Why are you suddenly asking questions
about your father and Ma'am Aurora?

135
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,255
To divert the investigation

136
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,466
about you pushing Sir Paco?

137
00:07:47,842 --> 00:07:49,677
What happened was self-defense.

138
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,264
No matter what court she takes me to,
I can defend myself.

139
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,224
Let's see.

140
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,151
Ouch.

141
00:08:06,235 --> 00:08:07,403
Does it hurt?

142
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,088
Yes, Iñigo.

143
00:08:30,384 --> 00:08:31,594
What's that?

144
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:39,685
<i>Mom?</i>

145
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:00,998
What's your problem?
Why did you throw that at me?

146
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,294
I'm just returning what you left behind.

147
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,966
Come on, Sam. Stop acting dumb.

148
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:13,219
It doesn't suit
a demon like you to play stupid.

149
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,098
You're so evil.
You would even involve my child?

150
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:18,849
What?

151
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:22,979
It was you who left
that Rubik's cube on the stairs.

152
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,273
And because of that, I almost fell.

153
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,026
George, I left that in the garden.
It wasn't me.

154
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,238
Really? So, who left that?

155
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:34,991
It was only you who planned to kill me.

156
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,868
Remember that you even
threatened me last night.

157
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:40,913
George, are you serious?

158
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,874
If I were going to kill you,
I wouldn't use a Rubik's cube.

159
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,169
And I would never use something
that I own.

160
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,588
Stupid.

161
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,089
Really?

162
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,342
Just like the car you used to run me over.

163
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:58,347
Don't tell me you even rented
a different car to use as a murder weapon.

164
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,608
There you go.

165
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:13,487
It's the start of World War III.

166
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:16,032
I love it.

167
00:10:18,534 --> 00:10:19,660
George, please.

168
00:10:19,744 --> 00:10:22,913
I don't have time
for your baseless accusations.

169
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:26,959
Come on. Why don't you check your CCTV?
If you can find me there, fine,

170
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,044
have me jailed.

171
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,795
I will really put you behind bars.

172
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,841
You really won't stop.
Are you planning to eliminate all of us?

173
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:37,094
Paco, Basil, me, and my baby.

174
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,430
George…

175
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:42,266
George, I'm pregnant too.

176
00:10:42,350 --> 00:10:44,143
And I'm going to be a mother
just like you.

177
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:46,270
I won't do anything bad

178
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:49,440
because the karma might get to my baby.

179
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,400
Good.

180
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,028
So, you also believe in karma.

181
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,657
Don't worry. You'll face her soon.

182
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,952
Her name is George.

183
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:34,193
There you go, George.

184
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:38,155
I'm now seeking revenge on Sam
on your behalf.

185
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:40,783
See, I'm fair.

186
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:45,579
And I hope that Sam has a miscarriage,

187
00:11:45,663 --> 00:11:47,665
so let's put some more.

188
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:49,500
That way,

189
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:52,211
the war between you two will continue

190
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:55,297
and you will get tired.

191
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:59,760
So, when you're both tired and drained,

192
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,720
what will happen?

193
00:12:01,804 --> 00:12:05,057
Sofia and I will reign

194
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,309
here on the Palacios estate.

195
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:15,025
So, good luck, Sam.

196
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,407
Sam did that?

197
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,700
Yes, Sir Galvan.

198
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:24,827
She wanted George to fall off the stairs

199
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,495
so she would have a miscarriage
and lose our grandchild.

200
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,997
How's the baby?

201
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,415
Mom.

202
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,169
Damn that woman.

203
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,755
George, where have you been?

204
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,966
Dad, I just talked to Sam.

205
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:41,469
What? You just came from an accident

206
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,262
and now you're looking for trouble?

207
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,097
What if she hurt you?

208
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,765
Be careful.

209
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,058
You're carrying my grandchild.

210
00:12:48,142 --> 00:12:49,643
Really, Dad?

211
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:53,105
She almost killed my baby,
and you want me to do nothing?

212
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:55,691
I'm just worried about your baby.

213
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,861
That woman killed her husband.

214
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,280
She almost ran me over before.

215
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:04,200
And now, she wants to kill my baby.

216
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:07,161
Who knows, maybe she was the one
who poisoned Basil.

217
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:10,831
If you and Auntie Aurora
can let that slide, fine.

218
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,208
But, I can't.

219
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,961
I will get justice
for what happened to my husband.

220
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:21,133
I told you already,
let's leave this place.

221
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,093
It's all trouble here
on the Palacios estate.

222
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:24,803
Mother, I didn't start it.

223
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,139
It's George who is accusing me
of a lot of things.

224
00:13:28,724 --> 00:13:30,518
Aren't you the one who really did that?

225
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:33,771
Mother…

226
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,900
Do you think I can hurt a baby?

227
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,277
I just want to hear it
straight from your mouth

228
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,112
because I have a feeling

229
00:13:42,196 --> 00:13:44,281
that you're no longer the Sam
that I raised.

230
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,494
Mother, this is still me.

231
00:13:49,578 --> 00:13:52,998
I'm just braver because
of the things I'm fighting for.

232
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,875
Like what?

233
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,587
Like what I found out about Dad.

234
00:14:02,383 --> 00:14:05,427
But, you should have
called the authorities,

235
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:07,054
like Sergeant Royales.

236
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,848
And then what?

237
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:12,643
Another long investigation?

238
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:14,895
I can't wait that long anymore.

239
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,192
What do you mean?

240
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,406
What's that bible quote again?

241
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,535
An eye for an eye.

242
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:32,121
A tooth for a tooth.

243
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:36,834
A life for a life.

244
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:43,841
What are you trying to say?

245
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,720
What do you want to happen, George?

246
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:48,929
Seek revenge?

247
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:50,848
Kill Sam's baby?

248
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:57,021
Is that more important than peace of mind?

249
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,858
Mother, even if we leave,
I still won't be at peace.

250
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:04,612
I will be uneasy
until I find out the truth.

251
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:08,657
Sam, we managed the last five years.

252
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,702
Stop digging about your past.

253
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:14,163
Just focus on your baby.

254
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:17,917
That's the reason I'm doing this.

255
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,920
This is for my baby.

256
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,257
He will grow up without a father
and grandfather.

257
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:28,177
I might have failed
in my relationship with Paco,

258
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,346
but I still want him to grow up knowing

259
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,391
that I did everything to find out
the truth about his grandfather.

260
00:15:34,475 --> 00:15:36,268
But, there's a different way.

261
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,729
You shouldn't be the one investigating.

262
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,358
It's not just me, Mother.

263
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,694
I already called Sergeant Royales.

264
00:15:46,236 --> 00:15:48,113
I already asked for his help.

265
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,126
Sam. Sam…

266
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,336
Mother.

267
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:10,552
- Ouch.
- Mother, are you okay?

268
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,179
How about you? Are you okay?

269
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,432
I'm fine. Why is it slippery here?

270
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,397
It seems there's oil here.

271
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,401
Is this oil? Who spilled oil here?

272
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,904
Who could it be?

273
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,408
So, you also believe in karma.

274
00:16:33,242 --> 00:16:36,203
Don't worry. You'll face her soon.

275
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,164
Her name is George.

276
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:43,752
Who else?

277
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:49,091
It's the person who wants
to hurt me and my baby.

278
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,517
George, are you serious about that?

279
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,148
Of course not.

280
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:08,444
I'm not as evil as Sam.

281
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,780
I'm just so frustrated.

282
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:17,202
I want to get justice
for what happened to me and Basil,

283
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:20,873
but she always gets away with it.

284
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,834
What will I say to my baby

285
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:25,919
once I give birth to him?

286
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,006
I'm sorry, my child,
your father was poisoned.

287
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:31,341
He was poisoned
by the woman living in the other house.

288
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,929
I understand you, George.

289
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,016
And the worst part is…

290
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:41,435
I have a feeling
that I don't have an ally.

291
00:17:42,436 --> 00:17:45,731
I feel so alone in my fight for justice.

292
00:17:56,617 --> 00:18:00,037
Me, George, I am your ally.

293
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,588
Mother, does it hurt?
Don't you want to go to the hospital?

294
00:18:09,671 --> 00:18:10,923
No need, I'm okay.

295
00:18:11,006 --> 00:18:12,966
It's just this foot.
It feels like I sprained it.

296
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,259
Put it here.

297
00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:16,136
I hope George experiences karma.

298
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,597
Francis, don't talk that way.

299
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,101
We're not sure if it was her who did that.

300
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,727
Mother, who else?

301
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:27,231
She threatened that
I would soon face my karma.

302
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,817
That woman is really crazy.
She should be ready for me.

303
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,485
Francis, where are you going?

304
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:32,694
Mother, I will talk to them.

305
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,238
What she did is not acceptable.

306
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,781
She put my nephew in danger.

307
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,033
I don't care if she's a woman.

308
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,910
We're talking about my nephew here.

309
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,079
Francis.

310
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:56,260
You may think I am weak, but you're wrong.

311
00:18:57,261 --> 00:18:59,721
I am a fighter too
when it comes to family.

312
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:01,765
And you are family, George.

313
00:19:02,516 --> 00:19:05,435
You and my grandchild.

314
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,523
Will you help me seek revenge on Sam?

315
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:11,525
Is that what you want?

316
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,653
I just want justice.

317
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:20,117
I want my son to grow up
in a peaceful environment.

318
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,327
A place where no one will hurt him,

319
00:19:22,911 --> 00:19:24,621
where no one will kill him.

320
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:28,750
Where there's no serial killer around.

321
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:32,963
That's also what I want for my grandchild.

322
00:19:34,256 --> 00:19:38,260
But, Sir Galvan,
Sam has a strong hold on your sister.

323
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,888
Even if she pushed Paco off the cliff,

324
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:44,558
she's still living there
in Ma'am Aurora's house.

325
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,852
Where is Aurora right now?

326
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,355
She's not here, right?

327
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:55,194
So, no one will save Sam now.

328
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:11,960
Oh, my. It's so quiet.

329
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,464
What's taking them so long to react?

330
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,477
Did Sam slip?

331
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:30,854
George! George!

332
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,440
George! George!

333
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:34,816
Hey, Francis. Why?

334
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,819
Where is George?

335
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:41,156
Why are you here? It's late
and you're disturbing us.

336
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,076
George. George, come out.

337
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,912
- I said don't disturb us.
- George, where are you? Come out.

338
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,497
- Just go home.
- You!

339
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,957
Serves you right.

340
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:53,669
Why are you making trouble here?
What do you need?

341
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,804
Okay, thank you.

342
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:10,477
Ma'am… Do you need anything?

343
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,772
No, I'll just return this.

344
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,526
I placed this on my mother's foot
because it's a bit swollen.

345
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:18,443
Let me do it.

346
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,486
No, it's okay.

347
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,530
It's Belen, right?

348
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,573
Yes, that's me.

349
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,409
I'm the caretaker

350
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:27,786
here in the Palacioses ancestral house.

351
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,791
- Let me. I'll do it.
- Okay, thank you.

352
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:36,628
Ma'am, do you also have that?

353
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,381
This one?

354
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,675
Yes, my father gave me this.

355
00:21:43,427 --> 00:21:47,514
It's because my doctor
used to always wear that.

356
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,809
He said it was for good luck.

357
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,603
- Really?
- Yes.

358
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,607
Actually, that's what my father said
when he was still alive.

359
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,401
That this absorbed the illnesses

360
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,362
of his patients before.

361
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,117
By the way, who is your doctor?

362
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:10,620
Orly. It's Dr. Orly.

363
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,540
Orly Castillo?

364
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,167
Yes.

365
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:20,047
He's the doctor who treated my pneumonia.

366
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:23,508
That's why I don't have asthma now.

367
00:22:23,592 --> 00:22:24,801
I'm no longer asthmatic.

368
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,850
But, his clinic is a bit far from here.

369
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,102
How did you become his patient?

370
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,147
When he came here with Ma'am.

371
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:39,941
Ma'am?

372
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,029
Ma'am Aurora?

373
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:45,947
Yes.

374
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,992
They came here several times.

375
00:22:49,576 --> 00:22:52,704
And then, Dr. Orly noticed
that I was coughing a lot.

376
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:55,791
So, he treated me.

377
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,590
What did my father do here
with Mom Aurora?

378
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,927
Father? Dr. Orly is your father?

379
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,846
Belen.

380
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:20,857
It's George. She placed oil on the floor.

381
00:23:20,941 --> 00:23:22,567
My mother slipped.

382
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:26,363
Excuse me. I did not put oil on the floor.

383
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:28,907
Believe it or not,
I don't have the DNA of a killer.

384
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,992
I wish I did,
but I'm not that kind of person.

385
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:32,661
I play fairly.

386
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:33,745
Liar.

387
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,997
It's only you who wants
to seek revenge on my sister.

388
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,916
What? Is this your way
to get even with what happened to you?

389
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,501
George…

390
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,087
Did you do it?

391
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,883
Dad, of course not.
I was with you the whole night.

392
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:51,930
If George said she didn't do it,

393
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,932
she didn't do it.

394
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,101
So, what now? Just like that.

395
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:58,061
I should just accept what she says?

396
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,481
No. Let's look at the CCTV.

397
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,986
That's right. That's right.
Let's get the CCTV.

398
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,657
Is there a CCTV?

399
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,453
Yes, there's a CCTV outside.

400
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,832
Let's see if George
is really telling the truth.

401
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,175
Sir, here is the CCTV footage

402
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,343
of outside Ma'am Aurora's house.

403
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,109
So, where am I?

404
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,445
I'm not there, right?

405
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:49,988
So, how could I have left the oil.

406
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,324
Wait. Let's wait for it.

407
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,959
You know Francis,
I don't know what kind of brainwashing

408
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,502
your sister is doing to you,

409
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,005
but obviously I didn't enter your house

410
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:08,924
to do what you're accusing me of.

411
00:25:13,803 --> 00:25:16,097
Wait. There. What's there?

412
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,392
Someone is coming. See?

413
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,644
Who is that?

414
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,896
It's clearly seen. Who is that?

415
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:25,732
You?

416
00:25:33,406 --> 00:25:35,075
Rico has been looking for you.

417
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:38,203
You have a lot of cleaning to do outside.

418
00:25:38,870 --> 00:25:39,996
Okay, sir.

419
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,414
Wait.

420
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,209
We are still talking.

421
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:46,586
I'll be the one to answer your questions.

422
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,505
Go ahead, Belen.

423
00:25:49,464 --> 00:25:50,882
Okay, ma'am.

424
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:01,518
So, my father came here before.

425
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,436
This is far from the mines.

426
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:05,647
Why did he come here?

427
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,945
Vivian, what did you do?

428
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,781
Was it you who left the oil?

429
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:15,907
There you go.

430
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:18,994
Don't deny it anymore
because your face is caught on camera.

431
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:20,245
There, you see.

432
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:23,748
You even brought something with you.
What's that? Is that the oil?

433
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:27,544
No. No, that's not oil.

434
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,546
That's food.

435
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:35,051
Because I cooked carbonara for Sam.

436
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,138
Why?

437
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:42,017
Because I want her to be my friend.

438
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:47,063
Because I promised Galvan

439
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,108
that when he allowed me
to come back here to the house,

440
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:52,444
I would be good to everyone.

441
00:26:53,611 --> 00:26:57,198
That's why I wanted
to be good to everyone,

442
00:26:57,949 --> 00:26:59,117
even to Sam.

443
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:04,205
I was with Rico.
If you want, you can ask her.

444
00:27:11,087 --> 00:27:13,340
You said you would answer my questions.

445
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,260
Why did my father come here?

446
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:21,264
Ma'am Aurora often comes here

447
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,016
when she's loaded with work.

448
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:26,978
Sometimes she asks the employees

449
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:28,355
to come here for a meeting.

450
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:30,857
They can think better here

451
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,026
if they're not in the office.

452
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,153
Meeting?

453
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:37,822
What kind of meeting?

454
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,658
My father was a doctor.

455
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:48,249
Budgets. Conditions of the miners.

456
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,170
It wasn't just your father who
Ma'am Aurora asked to come here.

457
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,507
Don't give meaning to what you found out.

458
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:13,233
Yes, sir. Ma'am Vivian gave carbonara.

459
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,860
It's delicious. I tasted a little of it.

460
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:19,823
She went to the comfort room quickly
and went home.

461
00:28:22,826 --> 00:28:24,202
I already told you.

462
00:28:26,955 --> 00:28:30,417
I wasn't the one who put
the oil on the floor.

463
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,879
Why would I do that?
What would I benefit from it?

464
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,718
Why are you accusing me?

465
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:43,054
I'm the one who wants
to befriend everyone.

466
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,727
It's okay. It's okay.

467
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,067
What now, Francis?

468
00:28:56,776 --> 00:28:59,195
Next time, don't just accuse anyone.

469
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,491
And respect the boundaries of this home.

470
00:29:05,285 --> 00:29:08,538
Don't come into this house uninvited.

471
00:29:08,621 --> 00:29:09,789
Do you understand?

472
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,710
Yes.

473
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:39,903
It's embarrassing that it's you
who has come to the office

474
00:29:39,986 --> 00:29:42,030
when you've just had from an accident.

475
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:45,950
You know, if it were possible,

476
00:29:46,034 --> 00:29:47,327
I would go to you.

477
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,914
But… Uncle Galvan would get mad.

478
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,752
I still don't get why Dad is mad at you.

479
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,966
What the hell?

480
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:05,845
Dad…

481
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:14,687
Didn't I tell you to stay away
from my son?

482
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,064
Dad.

483
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:17,398
Go. Just go.

484
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:19,734
Go. Just go.

485
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,777
Just go.

486
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,324
Forget about it.

487
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:29,160
I'm happy that we're seeing
each other here again.

488
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,748
So…

489
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,627
Welcome to my office.

490
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,878
This is it.

491
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:42,549
Coffee? Tea?

492
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,134
Oh, you're not allowed
because you're pregnant.

493
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,970
So, what do you want?

494
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,264
What do I want?

495
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,808
To sue Sam.

496
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,107
I'm sorry about what happened to you.

497
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,109
How are you and your baby?

498
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:04,404
We're okay. I came from my OB earlier.

499
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:07,657
Well, my baby is healthy
and the heartbeat is strong.

500
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,826
That's good to know, Ms. Samantha.

501
00:31:09,909 --> 00:31:11,786
Why did you ask me to come here?

502
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,372
Is that to find out
who put the oil on the floor?

503
00:31:15,248 --> 00:31:17,083
If you can help me.

504
00:31:18,751 --> 00:31:22,422
But, I have a more urgent concern, Sarge.

505
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:25,675
This is about the death of my father.

506
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:28,970
What case will you file against Sam?

507
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,973
Frustrated murder?

508
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,310
Something that…

509
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:38,104
will put her behind bars for a long time.

510
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:42,191
I don't know. You're the lawyer.
You should know better.

511
00:31:43,276 --> 00:31:44,777
George…

512
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,662
It's not that easy to file a case,

513
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,499
especially if you don't have a witness

514
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:01,169
who can confirm
that Sam was present at the crime scene.

515
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:04,213
The burden of proof lies with you.

516
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,931
How about this Rubik's cube?
This belongs to Sam.

517
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,059
All the information you need is here.

518
00:32:18,853 --> 00:32:22,273
I think his death is connected
to all the killings that are happening.

519
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,738
Is he a Palacios?

520
00:32:29,656 --> 00:32:30,615
No.

521
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,202
Why was he killed?

522
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,788
I don't know.

523
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,957
That's why I'm asking for your help.

524
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,627
It's stated here
that your father committed suicide.

525
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:45,797
Sarge, I have a strong hunch

526
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,632
that there was foul play.

527
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:54,639
That's just circumstantial evidence.

528
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:57,183
She can easily claim that…

529
00:32:57,266 --> 00:33:00,019
someone took it and placed it
on the stairs.

530
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,481
So, what am I going to do now?

531
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,818
Are you saying that I shouldn't sue Sam?

532
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,569
Is that what you said?

533
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,697
Am I just wasting my time here?

534
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,948
George…

535
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:13,866
George…

536
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,624
Sarge, will you help me look into it?

537
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,459
He died five years ago.

538
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,420
Five years ago.

539
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,214
For sure, this has been
investigated before.

540
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,718
What if there was a cover-up
in the investigation?

541
00:33:31,801 --> 00:33:34,971
What if they made it appear
like my father committed suicide?

542
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,056
Sarge, what's happening now is different.

543
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,516
There's already a Palacios killer.

544
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:40,059
What if he was one of the first victims

545
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:42,478
of the killer?

546
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,941
It's possible that the killings happened
as early as five years ago.

547
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,985
That's quite a stretch.

548
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,237
All you have are just theories.

549
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,489
You need evidence or a witness.

550
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:00,913
Ms. Belen, the caretaker.
She knows a lot of things.

551
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,083
She saw my father visit this place.

552
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,254
I know why you're doing this.

553
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,591
You want revenge.

554
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:14,844
I want to see her suffer.

555
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,930
I want to see her in jail.

556
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:21,517
George, this is not the way to go.

557
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:24,687
Filing a case is too much work.

558
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,982
There's pretrial,

559
00:34:28,066 --> 00:34:29,609
the investigation, and the hearing.

560
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:33,654
Those things will take up
so much of your time.

561
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,700
Time that you could spend
with your family,

562
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,036
with your baby.

563
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:42,705
What about Sam?

564
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,248
Forget about her.

565
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,918
Focus on yourself.

566
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,547
George…

567
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:55,551
But, this I promise you.

568
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,763
If Sam hurts you again,

569
00:35:00,181 --> 00:35:01,474
or your baby,

570
00:35:02,475 --> 00:35:04,477
I will take action against her.

571
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,564
Thank you, Iñigo.

572
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,526
Thank you for being such a good friend.

573
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,250
Rico.

574
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,044
Where is Ms. Belen?

575
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:31,712
Oh, ma'am. She just left.

576
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:32,880
What time is she coming back?

577
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:34,465
Sir, I don't think she will come back.

578
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,175
She took all her things with her,
and Sir Amando asked me

579
00:35:36,259 --> 00:35:39,220
to take her
to the bus terminal going to Leyte.

580
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,681
Do you know her number?

581
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,726
Here.

582
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:53,317
<i>I'm sorry. The subscriber</i>
<i>could not be reached.</i>

583
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,236
Her cellphone is already turned off.

584
00:35:57,905 --> 00:36:01,159
See? Sarge, there is
a cover-up happening here.

585
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:05,329
Sarge, please help me.
Help me get justice for my father.

586
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,086
Wait. Okay, there.

587
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,172
Okay. Slowly, slowly.

588
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:15,673
Be careful.

589
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,883
Okay?

590
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:18,718
Does it hurt anywhere?

591
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,678
Okay.

592
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,013
Hold on. I can do this.

593
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:24,098
- Hold on.
- Okay, go.

594
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:25,933
You can do this. Concentrate.

595
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:27,185
Okay, come on.

596
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:28,603
Okay. Go, Galvan.

597
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:29,687
Go. Go.

598
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,105
Okay, that's it. That's it. Come on.

599
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,273
Go. Go.

600
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:33,274
Almost got…

601
00:36:33,357 --> 00:36:34,692
- Hey.
- Dad…

602
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:45,494
Sam, I wonder who put oil on the floor.

603
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,664
I don't know. I don't care.
And I don't want to think about it.

604
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,458
We have a more important mission.

605
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,169
- What's that?
- We need to find something

606
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,963
that would connect Mom Aurora to Dad.

607
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:59,508
They said that Dad came here
several times.

608
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:03,221
Maybe he left something, or anything like…

609
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,223
A diary, maybe.

610
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:07,016
Start searching.

611
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:08,226
I'll check here,
and you can try over there.

612
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:21,113
Oh, my God. Please be careful.

613
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,532
- Are you okay?
- It seems that you can't do it yet.

614
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,161
I want to stand already.

615
00:37:28,371 --> 00:37:31,040
I don't want to stay here.
I don't want to sit down.

616
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,418
Don't rush it.

617
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,671
Slowly.

618
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,506
You'll get well.

619
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,341
You don't have to rush.

620
00:37:40,424 --> 00:37:41,592
Listen to your body.

621
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,053
Don't worry, I am here.

622
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:46,347
I will help you, I will not neglect you.

623
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,349
I don't want to be in a wheelchair,

624
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,184
especially if I have to face the board.

625
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:51,769
Board?

626
00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:54,397
You are going to work again?

627
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:57,984
Now that Aurora is gone,

628
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,988
I have to take over her position
as the interim CEO.

629
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,284
Well, that's good.

630
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:09,120
That's a very valid point.

631
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:14,917
Seeing you strong there makes
a difference, doesn't it?

632
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,044
Let's do this.

633
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:21,257
The next time we do
your walking exercises,

634
00:38:21,841 --> 00:38:26,804
just imagine that you're inside
the boardroom.

635
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:30,099
You have a board meeting,
and all the members are there.

636
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:32,393
And they are welcoming you.

637
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:36,480
Ladies and gentlemen, let's all welcome

638
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,608
the new CEO of Palacios Mining,

639
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,361
Galvan Palacios.

640
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,156
Right?

641
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,200
That's so exciting, right?

642
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:51,579
Just do that so you'll get inspired.

643
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:54,415
There's no need to do that, Galvan.

644
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,170
I can handle the affairs of my company.

645
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,255
Aurora?

646
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,983
You really won't stop
with what you're doing?

647
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,529
Mother, if you don't want to help us,

648
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:27,615
just let us be
since we are concerned about Dad.

649
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,617
What did you say?

650
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:34,455
Why are you here?

651
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,540
Aren't you in the mental hospital?

652
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,210
And I thought

653
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,254
we've finally gotten rid of you, Vivian.

654
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,673
But, I guess you're like an…

655
00:39:44,757 --> 00:39:47,134
undiagnosed herpes…

656
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:49,595
that keeps coming back.

657
00:39:50,471 --> 00:39:52,640
Did you escape from the facility?

658
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:54,308
No.

659
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,478
Your doctor released me.

660
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,314
She doesn't have a choice.

661
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:02,608
Unfortunately…

662
00:40:03,734 --> 00:40:07,071
locking me up
in the mental facility is illegal.

663
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:10,449
You may be my brother, Galvan,

664
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,828
but you are not my legal guardian.

665
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:16,414
Who?

666
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:18,374
It's Amando.

667
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:23,379
He is the only person I know
who has my best interest.

668
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:28,175
So, he called my lawyers
who called your doctor.

669
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:32,555
After a few threats here and there,

670
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,265
they released me.

671
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:42,690
Do you think
that I don't care about your father?

672
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,776
Mother, if you're concerned,
how come you're not supporting us?

673
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:49,447
What's wrong if we find out
what happened to Dad?

674
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:51,782
You don't understand me.

675
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:54,285
So, make us understand.

676
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:57,538
If you know something, tell us, Mother.

677
00:40:58,330 --> 00:41:00,583
Is there something
you're not telling us, Mother?

678
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:02,418
No.

679
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:06,839
If you're happy
with what you're doing, then go ahead.

680
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:09,341
But, I am worried for your safety.

681
00:41:09,425 --> 00:41:10,676
It's for your safety.

682
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,679
If you also take that negatively,

683
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,139
then you're on your own.

684
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,649
Aurora, you're sick.

685
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,195
That's why I sent you
to a mental facility.

686
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,197
I'm worried about you.

687
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,949
You made Paco taxidermy.

688
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:35,784
And you almost jumped from the balcony.

689
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:37,870
I got scared

690
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:41,373
because you might hurt yourself again.

691
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:45,211
That's why I picked my own doctor, Galvan.

692
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,588
And what did your doctor say?

693
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:49,715
Can you be released?

694
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,343
Well…

695
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:56,263
I opened up to my doctor and I said…

696
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,975
I'm having a hard time accepting
that Paco is dead.

697
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,853
That's' why I made my son taxidermy.

698
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:09,777
He said it is an unusual behavior,

699
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,446
but it is common for people…

700
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,574
with prolonged grief disorder,

701
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:19,787
and PTSD with psychotic features.

702
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,623
Are you psychotic?

703
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:26,502
My diagnosis is not yet final, Sofia.

704
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:30,923
I still need to go to therapy sessions,

705
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:34,301
and start taking my meds regularly.

706
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:36,804
Here.

707
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:41,058
Here's my doctor's treatment plan for me.

708
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,394
Do you want to see it, Galvan?

709
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,022
No need for that.

710
00:42:48,983 --> 00:42:50,234
Okay.

711
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:09,920
It's okay, Galvan.

712
00:43:17,177 --> 00:43:19,096
Sam, I can't find anything here.

713
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:20,556
Just keep searching.

714
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,293
Francis…

715
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,920
This is Dad's prescription note.

716
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,476
There's a new problem.

717
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,019
I know. It's Sam.

718
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:09,980
You're so bad, Orly.
I gave you everything,

719
00:44:10,064 --> 00:44:11,940
and you still left me.

720
00:44:12,024 --> 00:44:13,817
<i>Why does Galvan not like Attorney?</i>

721
00:44:13,901 --> 00:44:16,570
Maybe they weren't just best friends.

722
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:19,073
Maybe he and Basil became lovers.

723
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,450
- Iñigo, are you gay?
- What did you say?

724
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,369
<i>I smell something different from Iñigo.</i>

725
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,579
<i>We ran into someone</i>
<i>at the grocery store earlier.</i>

726
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,207
<i>He said he was the husband</i>
<i>of Dad's mistress.</i>

727
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:29,291
<i>Galvan, what if she finds out</i>

728
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:31,043
<i>what really happened to Orly?</i>

729
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:33,962
If the truth comes out,
we will all be in trouble.

730
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:37,049
That might be the end
of the Palacios name.

731
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,050
