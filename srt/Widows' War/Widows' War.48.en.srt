1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,974
Help me!

2
00:00:16,474 --> 00:00:18,435
You can't leave this place.

3
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:19,936
This whole place is locked.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,688
What Sergeant Royales said is true.

5
00:00:21,771 --> 00:00:22,647
I know Juliet.

6
00:00:22,731 --> 00:00:24,149
Your daughter is in danger.

7
00:00:24,232 --> 00:00:25,483
Forget about your anger.

8
00:00:25,567 --> 00:00:27,152
You need an ally.

9
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:30,238
I don't need your support,
you're all fake.

10
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,406
What's with you? Stop it, Mom.

11
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,242
And she also admitted
that you're her next target.

12
00:00:34,325 --> 00:00:36,619
- Why me?
- She knows that I love you.

13
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:38,163
She also wants to seek revenge on me

14
00:00:38,246 --> 00:00:39,706
because I failed to help her before.

15
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:42,959
I'm sorry if I didn't believe
you right away.

16
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:45,503
And thank you
because you wanted to protect me.

17
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:47,213
PREVIOUSLY

18
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:49,174
- I'm sorry.
- I need to use the bathroom.

19
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:51,718
I know George needs more prayers.

20
00:00:51,801 --> 00:00:53,970
Despite our fights,

21
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,930
she is still my friend.

22
00:00:56,014 --> 00:00:58,141
I don't want something bad
to happen to her.

23
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,268
Thank you.

24
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,104
George… George, please open the door.

25
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,776
<i>We understand you, Ruth.</i>

26
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:09,152
I am also a mother.

27
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:12,572
And I will not stop praying for her

28
00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:13,865
<i>until she is safe.</i>

29
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:15,909
Liar.

30
00:01:15,992 --> 00:01:17,827
You and Basil did have an affair.

31
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:20,246
You fool. Liar!

32
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,873
George. George.

33
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:23,374
George…

34
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,379
<i>If Iñigo is the Palacios killer,</i>

35
00:01:28,463 --> 00:01:30,757
<i>could it be that he already killed George?</i>

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,383
Please don't say that.

37
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,886
Iñigo will not kill George.

38
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,971
Please, don't think that way.

39
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:38,223
I'm sorry, Ma'am Ruth.

40
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,814
- Let's go.
- Let go of me.

41
00:01:45,897 --> 00:01:46,898
Inigo.

42
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:55,740
Sergeant, have they seen
anything in the CCTV?

43
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:58,034
Please, just do everything that you can.

44
00:01:58,118 --> 00:01:59,244
Yes, sir.

45
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,378
Dad…

46
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,006
I know you're worried
about your grandchild.

47
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,800
Me too.

48
00:02:14,592 --> 00:02:16,928
I am worried about my nephew.

49
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,598
I'm not just worried
about my grandson, Sofia.

50
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,352
I'm also worried for George.

51
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,064
I have grown to love her…

52
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,025
even if I don't show it to her.

53
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:37,448
But when Iñigo kidnapped her,

54
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,284
I got so worried.

55
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:44,747
I saw how much she loved
your elder brother, Basil.

56
00:02:44,831 --> 00:02:46,958
Someone did this to my husband.

57
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:49,752
Basil is allergic to morphine.

58
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,422
He wouldn't just take it on purpose.

59
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:55,425
Someone poisoned my husband.

60
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:57,844
Who did this to him?

61
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,055
I'll have this incident investigated.

62
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,267
We need to know who did this to Basil.

63
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:08,187
Whoever poisoned my husband
will pay for this.

64
00:03:08,271 --> 00:03:11,107
Basil.

65
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,902
Dad, I will find out
who did this to Basil.

66
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,906
That's what I promised him, Dad.

67
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:22,660
And I won't stop until I find

68
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:25,288
the demon who poisoned him.

69
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:26,956
No, Dad.

70
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,875
I won't let this slide.

71
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:32,754
She needs to pay
for smearing Basil's name.

72
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:35,965
I don't want to lose her.

73
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,594
She's like a daughter to me now.

74
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:42,680
I think George
is really lucky to have you, Daddy.

75
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,557
Because you're not like Auntie Aurora.

76
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:48,394
She's only after her grandchild with Sam.

77
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:00,949
Why did you lie to me?

78
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,034
Why did you make me believe
that you loved me

79
00:04:03,117 --> 00:04:06,454
if it's my husband you really love?

80
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:13,878
That Iñigo fooled your husband.

81
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,964
He extorted money from Basil.

82
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:18,591
It's a good thing
I was able to separate them.

83
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:20,385
Because if not,

84
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:24,389
that Iñigo would have gotten
all of Basil's money.

85
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,642
Stay away from him. He will not love you.

86
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,853
He will just extort money
from you and you will get hurt.

87
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:35,608
Believe it or not, George,
I don't want you to get hurt.

88
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:38,027
Maybe Dad is right.

89
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,030
You only extorted money from Basil.

90
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,909
But you failed to get what you wanted

91
00:04:44,993 --> 00:04:46,703
because he was able to stop you.

92
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:51,207
And then, you made me believe
that you loved me

93
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,751
to get Basil's money from me.

94
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,587
You're bad, Iñigo.

95
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,382
You're so evil. You fool.

96
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:01,843
George. George.

97
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,305
I didn't extort money from Basil.

98
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,057
We really loved each other.

99
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,477
George, I wanted to tell you

100
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,105
that I fell in love with you,
but I got scared.

101
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,984
I got scared
that you might stay away from me.

102
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,403
George…

103
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:23,239
I didn't plan to fall for you…

104
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:27,076
but I did.

105
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,540
George, I love you.

106
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,753
I love you so much.

107
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:40,381
And I hope you can still accept me.

108
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,391
Sir, just a little more
and we'll be able to trace him.

109
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,367
Ruth.

110
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,706
If George comes back,

111
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:17,210
be a better parent to her.

112
00:06:18,169 --> 00:06:19,378
Don't be like me.

113
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,965
I was a bad father to Basil
when he was alive.

114
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:25,051
Sir Galvan…

115
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:30,389
I'm sure you weren't a bad father.

116
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:35,019
You might have your shortcomings,
but you're not a bad father.

117
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,731
I can't afford to lose George.

118
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,775
I won't survive.

119
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:45,655
I'm willing to lose everything,
but not her or Ward.

120
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:48,533
I hope she gets home safe, Ruth.

121
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:53,287
It's hard to lose a child.
The pain is beyond compare.

122
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,666
I don't want to experience…

123
00:06:57,667 --> 00:07:00,711
what happened to me before
when Basil died.

124
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,965
I don't want to lose George.

125
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:21,691
I hope her daughter dies.

126
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:25,194
Sarge, we have a lead.

127
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:31,033
We've connected every CCTV footage feed

128
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,785
from the different stations.

129
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:37,415
Attorney Morales' car is headed south.

130
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,377
It was last seen
at Station Quiteria Nuevo.

131
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,254
And then it went into Paso Verde.

132
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,300
He only has one place to go.

133
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,429
Everybody, ready? Let's rescue Georgina.

134
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,764
Sarge, do you already know where they are?

135
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,558
Yes, sir. I know the Paso Verde.

136
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,560
There's only one way in and out
of the property.

137
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,813
I'm sure Attorney
is just in the vicinity of the property.

138
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,941
Galvan.

139
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,446
Thank you, Lord. Thank you!

140
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,698
Ward.

141
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:14,243
Your sister will be rescued.

142
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,878
George, believe me. I love you.

143
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:27,298
Stop it.

144
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,218
I don't believe you anymore.

145
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,928
You're a liar!

146
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:32,929
George…

147
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:34,555
I said stop it!

148
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,684
You already made me believe
in all your lies!

149
00:08:44,649 --> 00:08:47,109
Men, all set?

150
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,611
Yes, sir.

151
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,405
Sergeant Royales,

152
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,617
I leave my daughter
and grandson in your care.

153
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,786
Please save them.

154
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:00,498
Royales, I'm begging you.

155
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,793
Bring George and my grandson home safely.

156
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,420
Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am.

157
00:09:10,508 --> 00:09:11,425
You're going with them?

158
00:09:13,844 --> 00:09:15,263
What's this, Royales?

159
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,430
Are you serious?

160
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:18,266
He will only cause trouble.

161
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,935
Sir Galvan…

162
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:22,770
what if he can help out?

163
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,356
What is he proud of?

164
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,109
His skills as a <i>tanod.</i>

165
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:31,487
Mr. Palacios, he is not a <i>tanod.</i>

166
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,031
He's a soldier.

167
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:35,241
What?

168
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,128
Here's the proof.

169
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,576
I pity Ruth.

170
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,787
I can't imagine what she's going through

171
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,873
with what happened to George.

172
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,710
If that happened to any of you,
I don't know what I'd do.

173
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,295
Mother. Mother, don't worry,

174
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:31,922
because Sam and I will not be gone.

175
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,135
We will still be together
for a very long time.

176
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,349
Sam, why?

177
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:46,771
I can't stop thinking about George.

178
00:10:48,856 --> 00:10:51,942
I'm worried about her and her baby.

179
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,530
When I was investigating

180
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,949
all the people surrounding
the Palacios Estate,

181
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,077
I discovered that he was a soldier.

182
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,079
And he is not just an ordinary soldier,

183
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,289
he's a scout ranger

184
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,378
with experience in search
and rescue operations.

185
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:12,296
You lied to all of us.

186
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:16,050
Why did you work here as a helper?

187
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:20,388
Because I wanted to know my family.

188
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,808
What other secrets do you have
that you haven't told us yet?

189
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:28,187
My concern is the safety
of Ma'am George and your grandson.

190
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,190
I'll go ahead.

191
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,608
Sarge.

192
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,027
Men, let's go.

193
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:45,454
Earlier, I was just trying to encourage
Auntie Ruth and Ward.

194
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,707
But the truth is, I'm scared.

195
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:51,043
Iñigo might do something to her.

196
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,629
Don't cry anymore, Sam.

197
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,465
George will be saved. She will be saved.

198
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,885
Yes, Sam. She will be saved.

199
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:00,803
And with her return,

200
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,180
I'm sure you'll be able
to patch things up.

201
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,893
The truth is, I don't know if we can

202
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,396
iron things out
after everything that happened to us.

203
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:15,276
But for her to come home…

204
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,905
safe, that would be enough.

205
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,245
Stop crying.

206
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,956
Let's pray for her.

207
00:12:34,628 --> 00:12:36,839
Were you able to talk
to the person I asked you to contact?

208
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:37,923
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:39,758
What's the number?

210
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,431
Here.

211
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,350
Thank you, Rico.

212
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,852
You can leave me now.

213
00:12:49,935 --> 00:12:51,145
Okay.

214
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,947
I want an update
on what I asked you to do.

215
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:08,245
Sam, are you okay now?

216
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:13,083
Sam, don't worry. George will be saved.

217
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:14,752
We're close to the Lord.

218
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,047
Look at me. He healed my cancer, right?

219
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,550
Come on.

220
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,806
- Our mother is so sweet.
- Yes.

221
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,934
Mother is sweet now.

222
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:34,104
I'm just happy
because I'm with my children.

223
00:13:34,688 --> 00:13:36,273
We're complete.

224
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,277
And I love you. I love you.

225
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,279
- I love you, Mother.
- I love you, Mother.

226
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:46,116
I don't want you to fail.

227
00:13:46,992 --> 00:13:49,954
I want you to do your job well.

228
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:55,543
I won't pay five million pesos
for a sloppy job.

229
00:13:56,252 --> 00:13:57,461
Good.

230
00:13:58,337 --> 00:13:59,338
Update me right away.

231
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,678
What the hell Amando?

232
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:11,517
Can you please make a sound
if you're coming in?

233
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,852
What do you need?

234
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,442
Francis. Remember my reminders.

235
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:22,027
Take care of yourself.

236
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,029
Just because you're healed,

237
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,240
you will ignore yourself
and won't be cautious.

238
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,616
That's right.

239
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:29,535
Yes, Mother.

240
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:32,162
And I don't want my cancer to return.

241
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,123
And I will still be the best uncle, right?

242
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,501
That's why I will really
take care of myself.

243
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,963
And you, Sam.

244
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:42,756
You should take good care of yourself

245
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,216
while looking for evidence,

246
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,051
so you can give your father justice.

247
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:50,848
Be careful. The opponent
you chose is very difficult.

248
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:55,185
Yes, Mother.
Don't worry about me, okay? Okay.

249
00:14:58,147 --> 00:15:00,482
Mother, why do you keep on hugging us?

250
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,775
You've been doing that for a while now.

251
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,694
Give me a kiss.

252
00:15:03,777 --> 00:15:05,070
That's a lot of kisses.

253
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,202
Who are you talking to, madam?

254
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,122
Some guy.

255
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,083
Are you…

256
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,086
Are you planning something, madam?

257
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:37,937
Wait for a second.

258
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,314
I will buy Sampaguita
for our altar at home.

259
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:41,774
The ones we have are already dry.

260
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,275
- Mother, I'll do it.
- No need.

261
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,234
It's just there.

262
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,570
- I'll go with you, Mother.
- No, I'll go.

263
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,157
Sam, I'll just call the driver.

264
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,125
Mother!

265
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,632
Mother!

266
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,220
Francis!

267
00:16:14,264 --> 00:16:16,266
Oh my God. Francis.

268
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:18,352
Francis. Francis.

269
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,188
Oh my God. Help us!

270
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:27,194
Loving you…

271
00:16:28,737 --> 00:16:31,323
was never part of my plans.

272
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:35,494
At first, I thought…

273
00:16:37,538 --> 00:16:39,289
I just pitied you.

274
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,668
But the more I got to know you…

275
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,591
the more I fell in love with you.

276
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,721
I want to stay away.

277
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,975
I can escape.

278
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,020
But…

279
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:05,149
I can't…

280
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,652
I can't stay away from you.

281
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,551
George.

282
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,888
George, we have to go.

283
00:17:35,971 --> 00:17:38,849
George… We have to go, George.

284
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:41,101
George, we have to go.

285
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:42,936
- Where are you taking me?
- Let's go.

286
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,146
I won't go with you.

287
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,856
- Let go of me, Iñigo!
- We have to go. Let's go.

288
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:47,608
- I said let go of me.
- Let's go.

289
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:48,650
Let's go.

290
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,766
Team Alpha, go that way.

291
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,476
Team Bravo, go that way.

292
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,145
Be alert and keep constant communication.

293
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:27,523
If you see something suspicious,
use the radio right away.

294
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,732
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

295
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,275
Team, split up.

296
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,659
My team, be vigilant.

297
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,291
It seems you're used to this.

298
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,543
How many operations have you had?

299
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,419
I've lost count, Sarge.

300
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,466
Team, please proceed
to the east side of the woods.

301
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:56,051
That's where the possible location is.

302
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:58,262
Proceed with caution.

303
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,682
Go.

304
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,360
George, please.

305
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,030
Please.

306
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,741
Please, let go of the gun.

307
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,952
You don't know how to use that.

308
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,453
I know how.

309
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,290
Abdul taught me before.

310
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,126
Move over.

311
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,753
My baby and I are leaving.

312
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,719
Francis!

313
00:19:39,386 --> 00:19:41,096
Francis.

314
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,515
Francis. Oh my God!

315
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,686
Help! Help!

316
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,438
- Francis…
- Help! My God!

317
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,481
- Help!
- Help! My God.

318
00:19:51,565 --> 00:19:52,900
Let's go, ma'am.

319
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,693
Francis! Help!

320
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,820
Help! Help!

321
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:58,071
- Francis!
- Hurry up!

322
00:19:58,155 --> 00:19:59,531
All right.

323
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,201
Francis… Francis…

324
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,453
Help. Help us.

325
00:20:04,536 --> 00:20:06,121
- Francis, Francis…
- Francis.

326
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,581
Francis, don't.

327
00:20:07,664 --> 00:20:10,000
Help! Hurry, Mister!

328
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,214
George, please.

329
00:20:17,466 --> 00:20:18,759
Give me the gun.

330
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,595
- I will explain everything to you.
- No!

331
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:25,140
It's just me and my baby who are leaving.

332
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:27,392
So move over!

333
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,853
Because if you don't, I won't think twice

334
00:20:29,937 --> 00:20:31,438
about shooting you, Iñigo.

335
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,966
What are you looking at?

336
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,134
George, we really have to go.

337
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,221
Sergeant Royales is here already.
Please, let's go.

338
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,030
Let's go.

339
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,115
Let's go.

340
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,117
Let go of me, Iñigo.

341
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,743
- Let's go.
- Let go of me!

342
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:55,314
Go, go, go.

343
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,525
Check upstairs.

344
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,668
Sofia. Sofia.

345
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:19,629
Come here. Come here.

346
00:22:20,464 --> 00:22:23,008
You're even holding hands.

347
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,552
- Come here.
- Mom.

348
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,887
What are you doing?

349
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,222
Are you letting that guy flirt with you?

350
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:30,891
Didn't I warn you already?

351
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:34,519
And his mother, she's doing nothing.

352
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,229
She's not saying anything
even if she sees you.

353
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:38,315
She's tolerating you.

354
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,941
Check the doors.

355
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,041
They are not here.

356
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,419
Mom, we're just praying for Auntie George.

357
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:01,797
Praying for Auntie George?

358
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,591
And since when is it your
obligation to pray for George?

359
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:05,926
Come on.

360
00:23:06,009 --> 00:23:07,385
Nothing will happen with your prayers,

361
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:10,180
so just reserve that for other things.

362
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,556
Hey, Vivian.

363
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,184
You really have a bad attitude.

364
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,353
Are you sure Sofia is your daughter?

365
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,521
Because she has a heart while you don't.

366
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:19,314
And what are you talking about?

367
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:24,027
George.

368
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,737
George!

369
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,283
Javier, Cruz,

370
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:31,618
come with me.

371
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,994
Hurry!

372
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,414
Not now, Miss Samantha.

373
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,707
We're rescuing George.

374
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,085
Sergeant Royales, help us.

375
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,419
Help me.

376
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,923
The Palacios killer ran over Francis,

377
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,425
my brother.

378
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:48,552
What?

379
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:50,804
That's your karma.
What's happening to you is your karma!

380
00:23:50,887 --> 00:23:52,472
- Hey, you're too much.
- And why?

381
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,224
My daughter is in danger!

382
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,934
Well, serves you right.

383
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,352
- That's true.
- So, you've changed now?

384
00:23:57,435 --> 00:23:59,813
- Of course.
- We are all praying here.

385
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:01,523
- And you're doing something!
- Praying, really? I saw the two

386
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,483
- just flirting around.
- They're not flirting.

387
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:04,901
- They're just praying!
- What do I care about her?

388
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,778
What do I care about George?

389
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,369
There's a third Palacios killer?

390
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:17,622
He was wearing black and a mask,

391
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:19,583
just like the one who attacked George.

392
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,293
Francis is not a Palacios.

393
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:22,460
Why is he the target?

394
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:26,298
I don't know.
I don't know. Please help us.

395
00:24:26,381 --> 00:24:29,009
Yes. Text me the details.

396
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:31,303
I'll call the station
and send an investigator there.

397
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,679
Okay.

398
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:35,682
Lord…

399
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,518
I'm begging you.

400
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,521
Please save Francis.

401
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:08,006
Oh, why did you stop?

402
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:09,507
Continue.

403
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:14,638
Since I'm already used
to your cheap fights.

404
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:16,806
What are you waiting for?

405
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,558
Ah.

406
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,852
Do you want a knife?

407
00:25:21,519 --> 00:25:24,147
Rico. Rico.

408
00:25:24,231 --> 00:25:26,483
Get two knives.

409
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:30,904
I will watch
these uneducated women kill each other.

410
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:46,086
Lord…

411
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:48,546
Please don't take him.

412
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:51,091
He is still young.

413
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,509
Just take me instead.

414
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,888
Not my youngest.

415
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,183
Not my youngest…

416
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:02,060
Francis…

417
00:26:11,486 --> 00:26:14,823
Iñigo, why are you escaping
from Sergeant Royales?

418
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:19,953
If you are innocent,
why are you running away?

419
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:27,335
- Can you still see them?
- Not anymore, Sarge.

420
00:26:28,044 --> 00:26:29,587
It seems the suspect knows the place.

421
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,381
That's why he can lead us astray.

422
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:33,508
Team, let's split up.

423
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,135
Go there and we'll go here.

424
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:36,636
- Yes, sir.
- Go.

425
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,517
Okay, I will tell them.

426
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,519
I hope Francis will be saved.

427
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:45,854
Okay.

428
00:26:46,479 --> 00:26:47,939
Ma'am, it's Francis.

429
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,482
Why? What happened to Francis?

430
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,109
Someone ran him over.

431
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,485
- What?
- What?

432
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:54,029
Francis?

433
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,323
Ms. Mercy was the target.

434
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:59,326
She was about to get run over,
but Francis saved her.

435
00:26:59,409 --> 00:27:01,745
So, he was run over intentionally?

436
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,746
Yes.

437
00:27:07,625 --> 00:27:09,002
Doc…

438
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,171
how's my brother?

439
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:14,257
Francis sustained significant head trauma.

440
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,052
There's a fracture in his skull

441
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,679
because of the severe head injury.

442
00:27:19,763 --> 00:27:23,183
We immediately did what we could
to relieve the built-up pressure

443
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:25,226
because of the swelling.

444
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,856
So we performed an emergency craniotomy.

445
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,567
But he is safe, right?

446
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,653
Tell me please that he will survive this.

447
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:42,410
Maybe it's true
that you're Juliet's accomplice.

448
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:47,207
Maybe it's true
that you are the Palacios killer.

449
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:58,968
What are you smiling about?

450
00:27:59,761 --> 00:28:03,306
Are you happy
about what happened to Francis?

451
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:06,976
Me? Happy?

452
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,978
Of course not.

453
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:12,273
Maybe it's you who is happy, Aurora.

454
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:16,277
No, no. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

455
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:19,447
Wrong word, wrong word.

456
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:20,990
What's the right word?

457
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,328
Disappointed?

458
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,664
Disappointed because…

459
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:32,335
it was Francis
who got run over and not Mercy.

460
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,337
Mom.

461
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:39,843
I wish I could give you
a definite answer now.

462
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:42,846
But with brain injuries like this,

463
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,305
things can be unpredictable.

464
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,565
Why are you killing the Palacios?

465
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,903
Damn it, Iñigo. Answer me.

466
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,574
Why are you killing the Palacios?

467
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,993
Because they are monsters.

468
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:13,668
So, what's that supposed to mean, Vivian?

469
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,588
You malicious gold digger.

470
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:20,383
Are you okay now, madam?

471
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,388
I don't know, Amando.

472
00:29:27,557 --> 00:29:30,852
But I still want to get rid of that Mercy.

473
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,610
Nothing.

474
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:40,737
Nothing, Aurora.

475
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:53,625
I just remembered something.

476
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:59,631
Sofia, let's go.

477
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:02,592
Let's go.

478
00:30:07,222 --> 00:30:08,223
Doc…

479
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,601
please save my son.

480
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:14,771
Don't forsake him.

481
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:18,107
I'm begging you, Doc.

482
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,651
Doc…

483
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,862
Francis' vitals are stable for now.

484
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,615
But we need to observe him

485
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,700
over the next day or two.

486
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,536
If he continues to improve

487
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:32,914
and there's no increase in pressure…

488
00:30:34,165 --> 00:30:37,710
Well, his chances will improve.

489
00:30:37,794 --> 00:30:40,004
They have destroyed a lot of lives.

490
00:30:41,589 --> 00:30:43,675
They have destroyed a lot of families,

491
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:46,219
including my family.

492
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,978
That's why you're seeking revenge?

493
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,396
Yes.

494
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,692
Their evil ways must stop.

495
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,820
They must disappear from this world.

496
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:07,365
They killed my parents.

497
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,578
They destroyed my life.

498
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,930
I am not Iñigo Morales.

499
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:36,895
My name is Antonio Beringuela,

500
00:31:38,646 --> 00:31:40,481
son of José Beringuela,

501
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:47,697
owner of a once thriving
small-scale mining company.

502
00:31:50,491 --> 00:31:52,660
Doc, what do we need to do?

503
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:57,040
Right now, the best thing you can do is…

504
00:31:57,123 --> 00:31:58,541
be there for him.

505
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,085
Stay positive.

506
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:05,506
We'll give him
the best care possible in the ICU:

507
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,592
ventilation,

508
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,595
medication to control the swelling,

509
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:13,932
and around-the-clock monitoring.

510
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:17,644
Excuse me.

511
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,828
1995.

512
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,377
Aurora and Galvan went to Daddy

513
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,922
to buy his small mining company.

514
00:32:46,673 --> 00:32:50,635
They promised him
that they would make him a partner,

515
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,848
but that wasn't their plan.

516
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:02,772
When Daddy sold the mines to the Palacios…

517
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:05,149
Chief. Wait, Chief.

518
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,693
I am innocent.

519
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,486
I didn't steal that gold.

520
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,947
Aurora, Galvan…

521
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,991
Why are you doing this to me?

522
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,659
Why are you framing me?

523
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:16,536
We are not.

524
00:33:16,619 --> 00:33:18,913
You stole that gold from us.

525
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,791
We have proof. We have witnesses.

526
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,920
You demon.

527
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,592
After we trusted you

528
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,386
and made you a partner.

529
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,221
This is how you repay us?

530
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,225
- Arrest him, Chief.
- Yes, ma'am.

531
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:40,768
This is not acceptable.

532
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:41,769
- I am innocent.
- Sir.

533
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,604
Sir, my husband!

534
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:47,275
You… You are the demons.

535
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,402
You only want our mines,

536
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,612
but you have no plans
of making my husband a partner

537
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:55,116
of Palacios Mining.
That's why you're doing this.

538
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,331
Let's go, Aurora.

539
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,090
Mom.

540
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,176
Antonio.

541
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,700
Francis, my son…

542
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:40,536
Francis, please fight.

543
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,041
Fight, my dear.

544
00:34:50,213 --> 00:34:51,672
Francis, you said,

545
00:34:51,756 --> 00:34:55,718
you'd be the best uncle to my baby, right?

546
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:58,137
Please fight.

547
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:01,265
Fight, Francis.

548
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,778
Aurora and Galvan succeeded in their plan.

549
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:20,368
They got the mines,

550
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:23,788
and put Daddy in jail.

551
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:29,085
But things didn't end there.

552
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,549
They had Daddy killed…

553
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,302
so he couldn't go after them.

554
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,805
And what happened to Mommy…

555
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,268
Well, she didn't die of a heart attack.

556
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:48,479
Mom…

557
00:35:49,897 --> 00:35:51,357
Mom?

558
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,069
Mom?

559
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:57,822
Mom!

560
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,658
Mom!

561
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:02,660
Mom!

562
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:05,288
Antonio? Antonio?

563
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,081
Mom!

564
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:08,791
Zenaida.

565
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:11,294
Zenaida…

566
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,142
I was so young then.

567
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,687
But ever since that day,

568
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,608
what happened to my parents…

569
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:37,028
has never left my mind.

570
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:40,114
Every day…

571
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,744
I always think about them over and over,

572
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,123
and even in my dreams.

573
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:55,338
It seems like everything
happened yesterday.

574
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:01,594
My God.

575
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:05,223
My God. I need you, Francis.

576
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:08,392
We'll still give Dad justice, remember?

577
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,978
Francis, I need you.

578
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:20,571
Francis, can you hear us?

579
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:30,748
Francis…

580
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,210
Francis, can you hear us?

581
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:39,799
Francis…

582
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:47,598
Godmother Almira adopted me.

583
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:53,187
At that time she lost her son…

584
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:56,190
Iñigo, because of cancer.

585
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:00,486
She helped me forget everything.

586
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,948
Everything that happened in my family.

587
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:08,077
She raised me as Iñigo Morales.

588
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:16,502
But I haven't lost who I am.

589
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,464
I wanted revenge.

590
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,010
I searched for an ally.

591
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,721
And I met Juliet.

592
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:29,890
We planned our revenge
against the Palacios.

593
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,020
We will kill all of them.

594
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:36,314
We planned our revenge.

595
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,860
I infiltrated the Palacios Estate
through Basil.

596
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,988
I found out about his gender.

597
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,782
And befriended him…

598
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:50,911
And I seduced him.

599
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,876
You're an animal.

600
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,922
Basil didn't wrong you.

601
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,260
If you are mad at Auntie Aurora and Dad,

602
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,096
why did you involve him?

603
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,224
- Basil was a good man.
- No!

604
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,944
Basil was as evil as his father.

605
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,198
Sam was telling the truth.

606
00:39:28,741 --> 00:39:30,993
Basil ordered her..

607
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,081
to kill you because he found out
that you can't have children.

608
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,001
No. That's not true.

609
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,753
It is the truth.

610
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:45,925
Charge 250 joules.

611
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,760
- Everybody clear?
- Yes, Doc.

612
00:39:47,843 --> 00:39:50,096
One, two, three…

613
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:51,806
No, Francis!

614
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:53,349
‪NEXT EPISODE

615
00:39:53,432 --> 00:39:55,393
- Francis…
- Ms. Samantha said

616
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,270
it was the Palacios killer
who ran over his brother.

617
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,939
Attorney Morales is saying

618
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,149
there's another Palacios killer,
the mastermind.

619
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,777
Mom, I don't want to go to jail.

620
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,656
Are you behind the mask
of the Palacios killer

621
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:12,243
or someone you hired?
