1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,807
<i>What happened in the interview?</i>

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,684
<i>Mother, I had to confess</i>
<i>about the blackmail.</i>

3
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:22,188
I'm sure they'll find out
that I placed Francis' morphine

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,648
in George's room.

5
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:24,566
You did that?

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:27,527
What Sergeant Casas knew is
that I placed that in George's room.

7
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:28,862
Francis…

8
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:31,156
It was you who brought me to that hell.

9
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:34,784
The video of Paco
came from Basil's laptop.

10
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,871
And Sam said to Sergeant Royales

11
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:39,789
that she was blackmailed by Basil.

12
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,249
That woman is an animal.

13
00:00:41,332 --> 00:00:43,168
<i>She will destroy my husband's reputation?</i>

14
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,378
- Calm down.
- No, Dad.

15
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:47,380
I won't let this slide.

16
00:00:47,464 --> 00:00:50,467
Auntie Aurora and Auntie Hillary
wrote to each other?

17
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:52,051
PREVIOUSLY

18
00:00:53,052 --> 00:00:55,055
You're a monster, Auntie Aurora.

19
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,931
Sam, why are you spreading rumors

20
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:58,641
that Basil blackmailed you?

21
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:00,477
<i>Trust me, George. You don't want to know.</i>

22
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,520
Whatever that was,
you didn't want to do it.

23
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:05,356
<i>That's why you poisoned him.</i>
<i>So he wouldn't expose you.</i>

24
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,567
Why did you give away my children?

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,027
Rebecca, let me explain.

26
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:13,114
Rebecca, no.

27
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,200
You monster!

28
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:17,202
Amando.

29
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,665
Amando, help. Amando.

30
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:23,583
Amando.

31
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:26,753
Amando.

32
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,951
You poisoned Basil.

33
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:01,579
I didn't poison your husband.

34
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:02,831
Yes, you did.

35
00:02:03,915 --> 00:02:05,583
You poisoned my husband.

36
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:10,130
He witnessed you
pushing Paco off the cliff.

37
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,631
That's why you poisoned him.

38
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,967
- Fine. Fine.
- You poisoned my husband.

39
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:16,386
Fine, you really want to know
what he asked me to do?

40
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:18,471
Fine. I will tell you, George.

41
00:02:19,556 --> 00:02:23,017
Your husband wanted me to kill you.

42
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:28,398
Where are my children?

43
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:32,443
Rebecca…

44
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,864
Where did you take my twins?

45
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:38,158
Rebecca, no.

46
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,993
- No?
- No, Rebecca, no.

47
00:02:40,076 --> 00:02:40,910
Where?

48
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,205
What?

49
00:02:44,289 --> 00:02:46,416
That's the truth, George.

50
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,711
That's the reason he blackmailed me

51
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,796
in exchange for him hiding the video.

52
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,591
Your own husband wanted you killed.

53
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:59,012
My husband is dead
and you're still destroying him.

54
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:04,017
Wake up, George.

55
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,020
He wanted you dead. Wake up.

56
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,691
No. No, Rebecca.

57
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,067
Rebecca, no.

58
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:14,736
No. No, Rebecca.

59
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,238
No, Rebecca…

60
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:22,535
Rebecca… Rebecca… Rebecca, please. Please.

61
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,204
Rebecca. No, no, no.

62
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:27,206
No, please.

63
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,792
Listen to me first.

64
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:33,671
Let me explain so you understand.

65
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:37,508
Rebecca, please…

66
00:03:38,426 --> 00:03:40,303
I will explain.

67
00:03:45,892 --> 00:03:47,769
Then why didn't you kill me?

68
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,480
If it's true that Basil blackmailed you,

69
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:53,149
then it would have been easy
for you to just kill me.

70
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,610
Because I am not a murderer, George.

71
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:58,279
We're friends.

72
00:03:58,988 --> 00:03:59,906
Even if we don't get along…

73
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:01,616
we never get along,

74
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,868
We are friends.

75
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,912
And you're a part of my life.

76
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:09,624
Georgina…

77
00:04:14,128 --> 00:04:15,380
That's okay.

78
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,090
Sam.

79
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:21,094
You know, when it comes to love,

80
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,596
you should only tell your best friends.

81
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:28,726
But, good…

82
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:45,827
Let's do what you did before.

83
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,828
Here it goes.

84
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:50,415
George, thank you.

85
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,043
You defended me earlier.

86
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,901
Give me a reasonable explanation…

87
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:24,699
as to why you gave away my children.

88
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:26,242
Rebecca…

89
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:30,913
I wanted to secure the future
of your twins.

90
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,292
I know their lives would be normal…

91
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:36,961
with Larry and Barry.

92
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,630
That's why I gave them up for adoption.

93
00:05:39,714 --> 00:05:44,302
I did it for your sake
and for your babies.

94
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:54,353
<i>Your husband wanted me to kill you.</i>

95
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:58,149
That's the reason he blackmailed me

96
00:05:58,232 --> 00:06:00,276
in exchange for him hiding the video.

97
00:06:00,359 --> 00:06:02,737
Your own husband wanted you killed.

98
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:20,254
GEORGE.
BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!

99
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:22,340
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

100
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:39,857
Sam, wait.

101
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,197
Where have you been?

102
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:49,992
I almost got run over earlier.

103
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,702
Are you okay?

104
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:55,873
Did you see who it was?

105
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,424
It was you, Sam.

106
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,197
For my sake?

107
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:29,699
Yes.

108
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,742
Yes, Rebecca.

109
00:07:31,826 --> 00:07:34,370
You were so sick then.

110
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,247
You had episodes.

111
00:07:38,791 --> 00:07:41,836
I got scared for the safety
of your children.

112
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:46,799
You couldn't take care
of yourself, Rebecca.

113
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,135
You are very sick.

114
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:55,475
Look, you can't even remember
that you got pregnant and gave birth.

115
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,354
Really?

116
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,023
Really?

117
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:02,940
Yes.

118
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,919
But, when I started to get well,

119
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,712
you still kept it a secret.

120
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,049
You still kept it a secret from me.

121
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:30,176
Why?

122
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,804
Why didn't you tell me?

123
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,557
Answer me!

124
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,821
Answer me!

125
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,534
Rebecca…

126
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:10,132
Are you crazy? Do you want to kill me?

127
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,552
You tried to kill me first.

128
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,445
You will kill me?

129
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,031
No, Rebecca.

130
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:40,788
No one can ever kill Aurora Palacios.

131
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,499
Not even you.

132
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,841
Not even you.

133
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:56,512
Dear Rebecca, I'm sorry.

134
00:09:59,223 --> 00:10:00,057
I'm sorry.

135
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,769
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

136
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,273
You fool. You fool.

137
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,316
Fool.

138
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,026
- Fool.
- George.

139
00:10:10,109 --> 00:10:12,236
Wait, stop it. Stop that.

140
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:14,447
What's with you?

141
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:17,533
Think about your babies.

142
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,909
You're both pregnant.

143
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:25,750
You're pregnant?

144
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,378
Didn't Vivian's announcement reach you?

145
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,298
Yes, I am pregnant.

146
00:10:32,381 --> 00:10:34,800
But, I can still seek revenge
for what you did to me.

147
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,970
What's with you, Ma'am George?

148
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,182
Stop it.

149
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:45,061
Do you want to kill each other?

150
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,397
Do you know who would be happy
with what you're doing?

151
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,108
The Palacios killer.

152
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,027
You're making his life easier.

153
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,489
Ma'am George…

154
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:58,783
Ma'am Sam…

155
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:02,286
you're both carrying a Palacios.

156
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,413
It's your family,

157
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,123
our family.

158
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:10,711
Don't involve them in your fights.
They are innocent.

159
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,676
Let's go.

160
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,678
I'll take you home.

161
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,037
George will kill me, Mother.

162
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,539
She will also involve my baby.

163
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:49,667
Sam, let's consult Attorney

164
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:53,003
so we know what we should do with George.

165
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:05,641
Hello, Attorney.

166
00:12:05,724 --> 00:12:07,643
George, what were you thinking?

167
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,729
Sir Galvan, please don't get mad
at George.

168
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,400
Why not? She did something stupid.

169
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:15,901
What, George?

170
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,530
Why did you almost run Sam over?

171
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,616
I just retaliated, Dad.

172
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:25,578
She did it first.
She almost ran me over before.

173
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,956
Do you have proof of what you're saying?

174
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,375
None, right?

175
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,878
You didn't see the driver.

176
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:35,421
You didn't get the license number.

177
00:12:36,005 --> 00:12:39,717
But, Sam has proof and a witness too.

178
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,970
George, what if Sam suddenly sues you?

179
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,601
Yes, I have a witness. It's Jericho.

180
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:49,602
<i>Okay.</i>

181
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,229
<i>Will he be willing to testify</i>
<i>against Ms. Georgina?</i>

182
00:12:52,813 --> 00:12:54,356
I can talk to him.

183
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,109
<i>Okay. If he won't,</i>

184
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,778
<i>give me his number and I will talk to him.</i>

185
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,198
Just a minute.

186
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,536
Jericho Palacios.

187
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,040
0917837…

188
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,793
Sir Galvan, please help George.

189
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,629
I will really help her.

190
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,132
I won't allow your daughter
to send my grandson

191
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,884
to prison.

192
00:13:23,093 --> 00:13:25,221
What if Jericho testifies?

193
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,765
If he dares to take Sam's side,

194
00:13:27,848 --> 00:13:29,266
he'll end up fighting with me.

195
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,185
Thank you, Dad.

196
00:13:32,811 --> 00:13:34,188
Be thankful…

197
00:13:35,022 --> 00:13:36,690
you're carrying my grandson.

198
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:40,402
Next time you do something stupid,

199
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,154
think carefully.

200
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:46,283
Sir Galvan, are you just thinking
about your grandson?

201
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:51,038
Don't you even have
a little concern for George?

202
00:13:55,292 --> 00:13:57,586
It happened around 20 minutes ago.

203
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:01,966
What's with you?

204
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:05,094
Think about your babies.

205
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:06,470
You're both pregnant.

206
00:14:08,013 --> 00:14:09,431
You're pregnant?

207
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,685
Didn't Vivian's announcement reach you?

208
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,354
Yes, I am pregnant.

209
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:22,361
Attorney…

210
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,073
I'm sorry, I changed my mind.

211
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,076
I won't sue anymore.

212
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:32,663
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,627
You and Aurora are the same.

214
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,589
Only her grandchild
with Sam is important to her.

215
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:44,216
Are the Palacioses really like that?

216
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,302
You only care if they are blood relatives?

217
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,469
Stop it, Ruth.

218
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:50,514
Don't be overly dramatic.

219
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,101
And don't you ever compare me to Aurora.

220
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,147
George is also important to me.

221
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,653
After what that woman did to you,
you will just let it slide?

222
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:09,199
Mother, George is pregnant.

223
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:12,745
I don't want to involve a baby,

224
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,581
but what she did is unforgivable.

225
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:23,172
I almost ran over her once too.

226
00:15:25,049 --> 00:15:26,800
Is that forgivable?

227
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,855
George…

228
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,442
make sure you take care of my grandson,

229
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:46,987
and we won't have a problem.

230
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:50,783
Yes, Dad.

231
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:53,327
Good.

232
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,477
What's happening?

233
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,399
Saint Ignatius Mental Facility…

234
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:26,860
- Let go of me.
- Rebecca.

235
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:29,071
- Please, I'm not crazy.
- Rebecca,

236
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,239
- I'm not crazy.
- Rebecca.

237
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:32,157
Hey. Let go of my sister.
Let go of my sister.

238
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,076
- Let go of her.
- Don't meddle, Jericho.

239
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,912
- Let go of my sister. What's with you?
- Jericho.

240
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,874
Jericho, Auntie Aurora wants
to take me away from my twins.

241
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,459
Help me, Jericho.

242
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:44,086
Help me, please.

243
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,803
I wonder where your brother is.

244
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:56,765
Mother.

245
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:58,934
Mother, open the door.

246
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,477
Mother.

247
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:01,979
- Mother.
- Francis…

248
00:17:02,604 --> 00:17:03,772
- My son…
- Mother.

249
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,190
What happened?

250
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,109
Why are you drunk?

251
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:10,279
Mother, are you still
asking why I am drunk?

252
00:17:10,946 --> 00:17:14,533
Of course, it's because
of your eldest child.

253
00:17:14,616 --> 00:17:16,326
Because of what she did to me.

254
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,289
- Because of what you did to me.
- Francis…

255
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,416
Francis… Francis…

256
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:24,376
Let go of me. Let go.

257
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:26,378
You're too much.

258
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:37,181
I won't allow you to send Rebecca
to a mental facility.

259
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:41,268
And who are you to meddle
with my decision, Jericho?

260
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:43,270
Rebecca is my sister.

261
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:46,398
- I have a right to…
- As far as I'm concerned,

262
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,985
you are not part of this family.

263
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:53,113
You are just forcing yourself here.

264
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:54,823
Ma'am Aurora…

265
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:58,077
I'm begging you.

266
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,079
Just let Rebecca stay here.

267
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:01,705
I will take care of her.

268
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,669
Did you know that she almost got in danger

269
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:09,880
while looking for you?

270
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,341
George tried to run her over.

271
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,388
What?

272
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,518
Sam…

273
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,812
Sam, are you okay?

274
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:27,022
How about the baby?
How's the baby? Is he okay?

275
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,149
Sam…

276
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,944
We're okay. I'm okay.

277
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,251
And you, what are you waiting for?

278
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:48,502
Get her.

279
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:50,504
Rebecca, stop.

280
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:51,630
- Guard.
- Rebecca.

281
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,215
- Guard.
- My sister is hurting.

282
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,008
Rebecca. Rebecca. Let go of my sister.

283
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,803
Rebecca, I'll take care of you.

284
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,264
Just stay here. Rebecca. Rebecca.

285
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:02,558
No.

286
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,725
Rebecca.

287
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:07,896
What's with you? Let go of me.

288
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,315
Rebecca.

289
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:15,821
What's with you? Let go of me.

290
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,575
Rebecca.

291
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,287
Rebecca. Rebecca.

292
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,414
What's with you? Open the door. Rebecca.

293
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,376
Rebecca. Rebecca.

294
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:35,549
Rebecca.

295
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:46,894
Are you gossiping about Ma'am Rebecca?

296
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:48,270
No, sir.

297
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:51,106
It's Ma'am Sam. Something happened
to her last night.

298
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:52,482
What happened to Sam?

299
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,152
Ma'am George tried to run her over.

300
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:05,037
George, since everybody knows
that you're pregnant,

301
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,624
Bill here will be your personal security.

302
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,668
Wherever you go, he will follow you.

303
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:16,423
Thank you very much, Sir Galvan.

304
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:18,383
Thank you, Dad.

305
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:21,386
But, I hope he won't follow me everywhere.

306
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,597
You should get used to it, George,

307
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,849
because he won't leave your side.

308
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,309
This is for your sake too.

309
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:32,981
George, you and Sam are the same.
You both have security.

310
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:35,192
George.

311
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:36,902
Aurora.

312
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,290
Francis, I'm the one you should forgive.

313
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:53,168
Because I've committed
a huge sin against you.

314
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,670
- I'm sorry.
- No, Sam.

315
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,382
I'm sorry for what I've said. I'm sorry.

316
00:20:59,383 --> 00:21:01,718
Everything you said is true.

317
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,262
I'm sorry because…

318
00:21:03,345 --> 00:21:05,806
- you got jailed because of me.
- No, Sam.

319
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:09,810
It's better that I got jailed
instead of you.

320
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:11,853
I can't take it if you go to jail.

321
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,064
That's how much I love you, Sam.

322
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,984
I love you so much.

323
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,569
I'm sorry for what I did.

324
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:21,571
I guess it's because
you didn't tell me right away.

325
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,698
I'm sorry.

326
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:24,116
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

327
00:21:34,459 --> 00:21:36,378
Aurora, what's this again?

328
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,130
Didn't you know?

329
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:40,716
About last night? Yes.

330
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,426
So, you were happy?

331
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:46,263
Because if this woman
killed my grandchild,

332
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,724
the only things left
would be your daughter and grandchild.

333
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,311
That's right.

334
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,604
Too bad Sam didn't die.

335
00:21:55,439 --> 00:21:58,817
Because if not,
I would be partying by now.

336
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,527
- Damn you, Galvan.
- Relax.

337
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,864
You're too serious. I was just kidding.

338
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,074
You.

339
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:09,161
Why did you try to run Sam over?

340
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,915
Because Sam tried to run her over before.

341
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,168
She's just retaliating.

342
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:18,879
Although, she's not sure.

343
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,843
I don't care if that claim
is true or not, George.

344
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:27,054
But, if you run Sam over,

345
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:31,141
do it after she gives birth.

346
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,060
End of conversation.

347
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,785
What's the problem this time?

348
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,330
It's George. She tried to kill Sam.

349
00:22:57,751 --> 00:23:01,171
I'm like a politician.
I have a personal guard.

350
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,591
Hold on…

351
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:07,344
Are you sure about me coming here?

352
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,346
Won't Uncle Galvan get mad?

353
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,182
I asked permission from Dad.

354
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,352
I told him I needed to consult with you

355
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,979
just in case Sam files a case.

356
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:22,651
You know, George,

357
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,569
you shouldn't have done that.

358
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:27,405
I know.

359
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:31,243
But, let's not talk about that.

360
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,245
I have something else to ask you.

361
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,038
All right, what is it?

362
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,416
Sam said…

363
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,128
Basil blackmailed her.

364
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,462
What?

365
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:44,965
Well, apparently, Basil witnessed

366
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,260
Sam pushing Paco off the cliff.

367
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:49,928
It was caught on video

368
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:52,639
and that Basil blackmailed her.

369
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:54,558
Blackmailed her?

370
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,518
To do what?

371
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,603
To kill me.

372
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:00,564
What?

373
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:02,691
Was that true, Iñigo?

374
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,111
But, don't worry.

375
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,572
Sam was able to escape.

376
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:10,365
My grandchild is safe.

377
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:14,035
That's quite a reaction, Mom.

378
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:17,664
I think you're too affected.

379
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:21,334
Is your heart softening for Sam?

380
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:25,213
Of course not, Paco.

381
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,301
I'm after the safety
of my grandchild and you know that.

382
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,188
I want to punish George…

383
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,107
for putting your baby in danger.

384
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,443
What does that mean?

385
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:52,240
Do you want to kill George?

386
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,455
Iñigo, please.

387
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,333
I need to know.

388
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,793
Basil was your friend.

389
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,670
You knew him very well.

390
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,381
Is he really capable of having me killed?

391
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,426
Why would he want me killed? Why?

392
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,138
George…

393
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:21,811
George…

394
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:24,522
Basil was a good man.

395
00:25:28,068 --> 00:25:30,612
Iñigo, you're not answering my question.

396
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,782
Please, I need answers.

397
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,951
Whatever…

398
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:40,705
whatever the answer is, I will accept it.

399
00:25:46,127 --> 00:25:47,837
<i>Your wife is barren.</i>

400
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,715
She didn't have an affair.
She's not a criminal.

401
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:53,927
So please, think about this.
You don't need to have her killed.

402
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,136
She lied to me.

403
00:25:56,888 --> 00:25:59,349
She made me believe
that we will have children.

404
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,351
And that's a crime.

405
00:26:02,435 --> 00:26:04,688
Its only punishment is death.

406
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,815
<i>I want to be free…</i>

407
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,067
<i>not only for me…</i>

408
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:10,860
for us.

409
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,614
Babe…

410
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:18,285
George needs to die…

411
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:20,870
for us.

412
00:26:23,623 --> 00:26:26,084
No. No, Paco.

413
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,879
George's baby is a Palacios.

414
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:32,132
We don't hurt family.

415
00:26:32,215 --> 00:26:34,592
I find that hard to believe.

416
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:40,432
What if George makes
another attempt on Sam?

417
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,310
Oh, God.

418
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,519
My grandchild.

419
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:50,317
Your grandchild will be safe
only if George dies.

420
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,071
Where is George now?

421
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,491
I don't know and I don't care.

422
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:01,953
Why?

423
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:07,208
Are you planning to do something.
That's why you're asking?

424
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:11,504
Just curious.

425
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,526
Please, Iñigo, I need to know.

426
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:38,156
George…

427
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:43,787
Basil would never ever think
of killing you.

428
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:48,416
He loved you, okay?

429
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,463
Basil sacrificed a lot of things for you,

430
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,632
for his love for you.

431
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:07,394
Bill, can you please get
my slippers in the trunk.

432
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:08,686
My feet hurt.

433
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,855
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Thank you.

434
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:50,770
Bill, have you found them?

435
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:55,066
They're just in the bottom section.

436
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,026
Just dig it.

437
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,744
Bill?

438
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:15,253
Bill, I'm sleepy already.

439
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:17,797
My feet hurt.

440
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:22,427
Bill.

441
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:41,529
Paco?

442
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:46,993
Please wake me up after ten minutes.

443
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:51,289
I have an overseas conference call

444
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:53,291
in 30 minutes, okay?

445
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,461
Paco?

446
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:03,343
Bill?

447
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,434
Bill.

448
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,603
What's taking you so long?

449
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,688
Bill, what's with you?

450
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,483
Bill?

451
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:21,069
Bill, what happened to you?

452
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:21,986
Bill.

453
00:30:22,987 --> 00:30:24,447
Bill, wake up.

454
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,157
Bill. Bill.

455
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:43,591
Paco…

456
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:50,765
Paco?

457
00:30:52,141 --> 00:30:55,228
Oh, my God. Paco, where are you?

458
00:30:55,311 --> 00:30:56,521
Paco?

459
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,398
Paco?

460
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,024
Where are you, Paco?

461
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,237
Paco.

462
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:17,750
Help me.

463
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:35,476
- Ma'am George. Ma'am George.
- Get away from me.

464
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:36,477
Ma'am George. It's me, Jericho.

465
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,855
- This is Jericho, Ma'am George.
- Get away from me.

466
00:31:38,938 --> 00:31:40,315
Ma'am George, the killer
was wearing black,

467
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,275
a gas mask, and a cape.

468
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:44,235
But, he is now gone.

469
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,530
Where is he?

470
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:49,991
He's gone. He ran in that direction.

471
00:31:57,582 --> 00:31:58,750
Dad…

472
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:01,878
the Palacios killer tried to kill me.

473
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:04,255
I heard a scream. Did it come from here?

474
00:32:04,339 --> 00:32:07,425
The Palacios killer was here,
but he ran in that direction.

475
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,468
Attention, all personnel.

476
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:10,345
Go to ground five.

477
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:11,930
The Palacios killer attacked.

478
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,684
Ma'am George…

479
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,353
are you okay?

480
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:32,659
Amando, Paco is missing…

481
00:32:33,493 --> 00:32:34,327
What?

482
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,207
Paco…

483
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,751
I've been looking for you.
Where have you been?

484
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:46,172
I just went outside the door,
for some air.

485
00:32:46,255 --> 00:32:48,299
Oh, thank God you're here.

486
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,011
The Palacios killer attacked again.

487
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,722
And who was the victim?

488
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:56,391
It was George…

489
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:57,934
but she survived.

490
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,352
Yeah.

491
00:33:00,103 --> 00:33:02,021
- Too bad.
- What?

492
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:07,694
I mean, if the Palacios killer
had killed George,

493
00:33:07,777 --> 00:33:11,364
there would be no need to worry
about the safety of your grandchild.

494
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,166
Where is Bill?

495
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,712
He's in the guard house.
His head is being treated.

496
00:33:25,795 --> 00:33:27,588
His head was hit by a stone.

497
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,257
He's a big guy.

498
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,551
He wasn't able to protect George.

499
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:34,929
I asked Bill
to get the slippers in the trunk.

500
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,223
He was not careless.

501
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,810
But, it was Jericho who saved me.

502
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:42,520
Yeah.

503
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,359
And I find it very strange

504
00:33:48,443 --> 00:33:50,820
that the person who betrayed you,

505
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,655
is the same person who saved you.

506
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,949
What?

507
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,325
It was him who told Royales

508
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:59,579
that you were the common link
in all the killings here.

509
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,956
And I believed him too.

510
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,334
It was you?

511
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,300
Sam, what else did Rico say
when he called you?

512
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,093
Mother, that's all. He told me

513
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:16,763
that the killer attacked George,
but she survived.

514
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,557
Oh, my God. Where is Francis?

515
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,768
I don't know. He's not answering my call.

516
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:30,526
Mr. Palacios.

517
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:34,322
My men are already at Ms. Georgina's car.

518
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,157
They are looking for evidence

519
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,493
that the killer might have left.

520
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,578
Ms. Georgina.

521
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,123
Did you see who attacked you?

522
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:46,876
Yes, but I can't describe

523
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:51,005
the height and build because it was dark.

524
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,134
But, he or she was wearing all black.

525
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:59,806
He was also wearing a cloak,
and a vintage gas mask.

526
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,813
Has anyone else seen the perpetrator?

527
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:14,028
That's what I also saw.

528
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:18,199
I'm not sure how big or tall,

529
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:20,284
or if it's a girl or a boy

530
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,704
because the person was bent over
while running.

531
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,208
Maybe he was avoiding the CCTV.

532
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:31,879
Just like before,
the CCTV failed to capture the killer.

533
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,800
It's obvious that the killer knows
where the CCTV cameras are.

534
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:38,970
Any other sighting?

535
00:35:39,053 --> 00:35:40,429
Is there anyone else who saw it?

536
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,808
Did something happen before this?

537
00:35:44,767 --> 00:35:48,312
Maybe we can get a lead,
or a possible suspect?

538
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,778
It could be Sam.

539
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,949
George almost ran her over
the other night.

540
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:01,784
Maybe she's retaliating.

541
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,958
Mother, Sam, it's me.

542
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,921
- Mother, Sam, it's me.
- Francis…

543
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,591
Son, what happened to you?
Why aren't you answering my calls?

544
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:19,594
Mother, I…
Mother, I went to get updates outside.

545
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,888
I know you are safe here,
so I went out first.

546
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,514
Mother, Ma'am Aurora ordered
all the guards to scatter

547
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,224
inside the mansion.

548
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,061
Mother, Sam, I'm worried about
your safety here, especially for the baby.

549
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,230
Oh, my God. My God,
it's getting too dangerous here.

550
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,690
We need to get out of here.

551
00:36:32,773 --> 00:36:35,526
I can face the case
even if we're in a different place.

552
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:36,569
I will call Sergeant Royales.

553
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:39,113
I will tell him where we are going.

554
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,406
Sam, what about the guards?

555
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,158
They were given orders to shoot us.

556
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,744
When I left,
I only reached the guard house

557
00:36:44,827 --> 00:36:46,579
because all of them pointed
their guns at me.

558
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,706
Ma'am Aurora's commands were serious.

559
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:49,916
Come what may.

560
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:52,001
If they stop us, just drive past them.

561
00:36:52,084 --> 00:36:53,419
We're leaving this place.

562
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:54,962
Go ahead and pack your things.

563
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,090
Let's just get the important things.
Oh, my God.

564
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:01,135
Well, it's their usual fights.

565
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,430
Accusations, and retaliations,
but no harm done.

566
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:06,515
Detective,

567
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,478
I'm sure by now, you already know
that George and Sam are enemies.

568
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:13,189
But up till now, we haven't heard

569
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:15,983
any news if Sam will file a case.

570
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,070
But, it's possible

571
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,572
that Sam will not file a case

572
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,367
because that's what Sam will do,
to kill George.

573
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:26,202
That's what I'm saying.

574
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,872
Maybe it was Sam who attacked George.

575
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:31,582
Yes.

576
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,086
Sam could be the Palacios killer,

577
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,421
or the mastermind.

578
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:44,929
Can everyone leave except
for Mrs. George and Jericho?

579
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:02,613
I would like to talk to you about
what happened while it's still fresh.

580
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,493
Ms. Georgina, please tell me
what happened.

581
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:17,962
Let's hurry.

582
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,382
Mercy…

583
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:23,592
Francis…

584
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,139
You can leave if you want.

585
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,725
But not you, Samantha.

586
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,436
You are not leaving.

587
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,276
How did you know that we're leaving?

588
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:45,656
Come what may, let's pack our things.

589
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,451
Let's just get the important things,
not everything.

590
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:49,618
Hurry up, Francis.

591
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,662
My God.

592
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:59,128
If my brother and mother are leaving,
I will also leave.

593
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:02,214
We came here as a complete family,
and we will leave together as well.

594
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,342
I don't think you heard me.

595
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:10,014
You are not leaving, Samantha.

596
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,892
Don't, Ma'am Aurora.

597
00:39:12,975 --> 00:39:14,727
Do not point that gun at my sister.

598
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,644
Francis.

599
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,988
Go ahead and shoot.

600
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,533
Kill your own grandchild.

601
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,584
You! Who wants to volunteer

602
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,169
to be the head of security?

603
00:39:40,252 --> 00:39:42,088
<i>I didn't know that you're a comedian.</i>

604
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:45,674
No one has ever made me angry like this.

605
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,926
Only Samantha.

606
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,636
NEXT EPISODE

607
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,970
Let's release our anger.

608
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:52,264
Why did you send Rebecca to the facility?

609
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:54,308
You sent Rebecca to the mental facility

610
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:56,310
because she found out
that you gave away her children.

611
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,063
What are you talking about?
Rebecca has no children.

612
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:01,023
It's you who should be sent
to a mental facility.

613
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,112
- Who are you talking to?
- It's George.

614
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:07,863
She was attacked by the Palacios killer.

615
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:09,865
<i>It's okay to be concerned.</i>

616
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,243
But, your reaction is too much.

617
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:13,744
Her life was in danger.

618
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:16,455
But, you don't have to be
so concerned like a lover.

619
00:40:17,706 --> 00:40:19,208
Oh, my God.

620
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:21,794
Are you falling for George?

621
00:40:21,877 --> 00:40:23,879
Don't dare me, Samantha.

622
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,256
I dare you.
