1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:17,017
Something happened to Aurora
and me. Paco is my son.

2
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:20,437
Is that true? You…

3
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,605
Are you Paco's father?

4
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,774
They don't have a relationship.

5
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,652
They just said something happened to them.

6
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:29,654
In that case…

7
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,322
PREVIOUSLY

8
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:33,783
Amando is Paco's father.

9
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:36,745
Sam's baby is his grandson.

10
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,789
Tell them the truth,
that I'm Paco's real father.

11
00:00:40,373 --> 00:00:42,667
It's all in your head, Amando.

12
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,170
Ambitious.

13
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,881
You're an animal… You're an animal.

14
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,513
Good, Aurora. It's about time.

15
00:00:55,597 --> 00:00:58,391
Oh, my God… Oh, my God…

16
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:02,145
<i>Amando came back here.</i>
<i>He tried to take us with him,</i>

17
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,855
<i>but Aurora shot him.</i>

18
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:06,149
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

19
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,359
Aurora let him escape.

20
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,444
What?

21
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,280
Ma'am Aurora, why did you
let Sir Amando escape?

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,617
Dad, what are you doing?

23
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,536
I don't want to give in
to the fear of that Amando anymore.

24
00:01:19,287 --> 00:01:21,081
<i>I need to confront him…</i>

25
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,125
<i>so he can stop threatening our family.</i>

26
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:29,005
Sofia, Ward.

27
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:30,965
What's with you?

28
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,092
We're all worried here.

29
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:35,887
But, what can you do
when you're facing Amando?

30
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,430
Yes!

31
00:01:37,514 --> 00:01:39,307
He has killed a lot of people.

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,518
I guess the guards know how to fight.

33
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:42,685
And you?

34
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,397
They're right, Sofia and Ward.
Don't be impulsive.

35
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:47,732
Don't worry.

36
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:49,567
We've already called for backup.

37
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:54,656
Miss Georgina, can you try
calling Miss Samantha again?

38
00:01:54,739 --> 00:01:56,032
I just want to tell her something.

39
00:01:58,535 --> 00:02:00,453
Sam, are you there?

40
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,414
Sam…

41
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:05,834
Sam, please answer.

42
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:09,337
Sam, please. Can you hear me?

43
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:14,467
<i>Sam, please answer. Sam.</i>

44
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,554
It's George…

45
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:20,932
I think I left the radio
in the living room.

46
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:23,393
I'll find it.

47
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:30,608
<i>Sam, please. Can you hear me?</i>

48
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,571
Ma'am George, this is Rico.

49
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,782
Where is Sam? Why do you have the radio?

50
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:44,038
Ma'am Sam.

51
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:52,547
George…

52
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:55,758
George, sorry. I left this
in the living room.

53
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,720
We didn't hear it right away
because they're noisy here.

54
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,347
<i>Rescue is coming, sis.</i>

55
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:04,684
Sergeant Tupaz is here.
Sergeant Royales is on his way there.

56
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,061
The backup they called is also on its way.

57
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,773
Thank God.

58
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,941
Thank God.

59
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,485
I hope they catch Amando soon.

60
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,698
I hope so because dad went out
to look for Amando.

61
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:20,909
Oh, my God. What?

62
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,829
You allowed Galvan to go out?

63
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,665
Aren't you thinking anymore?
You're all stupid.

64
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,752
Didn't you want to go out earlier, too?

65
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,254
You call us stupid when you're not here.

66
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:36,174
You don't know how we stopped Sir Galvan.

67
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,301
Mom, that's enough.

68
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,262
Sam, there's something else
you need to know.

69
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,680
What's that?

70
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:45,516
About Uncle Orly's death.

71
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,158
Dad… Dad…

72
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:04,285
Dad… Dad…

73
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,958
Dad…

74
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:23,471
Ma'am, my condolences.

75
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:28,142
It's good, ma'am,
that his neighbor immediately reported

76
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,395
that they smelled something foul.

77
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,855
When we entered his apartment,

78
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,817
we found Doc Orly dead.

79
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,278
And we saw this too, ma'am.

80
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:47,328
This is my father's handwriting.

81
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:53,334
Based on the initial medico-legal results,

82
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:57,005
Doc Orly died of a heroin overdose.

83
00:04:57,088 --> 00:04:58,172
What?

84
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,842
Dad was on drugs.

85
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:07,682
My dad is not an addict
and he would never commit suicide.

86
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,770
Ma'am, we found a lot
of paraphernalia in his room.

87
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:25,825
Wait, sir. No.

88
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,328
My dad is a decent person.
My dad is a doctor.

89
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:31,414
Ma'am, it's hard to say.

90
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,083
Sometimes, decent people

91
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:37,378
are the ones who hide some stench.

92
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,880
Wait a minute, sir.

93
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:41,883
Didn't you hear me?
My dad is a good person.

94
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,426
Do your job.

95
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,927
Investigate.

96
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:49,348
I know something is going on at the mines.

97
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,767
Ask the people there.

98
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,602
Do your job.

99
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,187
- There might be foul play here.
- Sam, that's enough.

100
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,481
Mom, no. What?
Are we just going to let it go?

101
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,983
Are we just going to accept
that dad committed suicide?

102
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,568
We know he couldn't do that.

103
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,820
Dad didn't commit suicide.

104
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:06,741
No. No. Dad.

105
00:06:08,576 --> 00:06:11,162
No, no, no.

106
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:12,205
Sam, that's enough.

107
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,000
Dad is dead. He committed suicide.

108
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:18,211
There's no need
to investigate anymore. That's it.

109
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:26,844
Miss Samantha,

110
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:30,848
Sergeant Royales found out
what really happened to your father.

111
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:35,186
The police officer handling the case has
already spoken to her and confessed.

112
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:38,898
What happened to my father?

113
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:44,278
Doctor Castillo did indeed
die of a heroin overdose,

114
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,530
but it was intentional.

115
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:49,075
He didn't do it to himself.

116
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:51,702
Someone injected it into his body.

117
00:06:52,286 --> 00:06:54,288
Your father didn't commit suicide.

118
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,748
He was killed.

119
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,919
Are you sure Sergeant Tupaz?

120
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,755
Someone did do it to Orly? He was killed?

121
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:06,050
Is there proof
that Sergeant Royales was found?

122
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,302
Yes, there is, Miss Aurora.

123
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,179
Who?

124
00:07:11,305 --> 00:07:13,474
Who killed my father?

125
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:17,145
The Palacios killer you're talking about,

126
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,896
Amando Namas.

127
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,715
Amando.

128
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:49,844
Face me.

129
00:07:51,512 --> 00:07:53,431
I'm not the Palacios killer.

130
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:57,560
I told you to face me.

131
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,022
What's the point?

132
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,692
You won't believe me anyway.

133
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,905
You will shoot me like Aurora did.

134
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:12,992
Do it.

135
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:14,118
No.

136
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,455
I want to see the face of the person

137
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:21,000
who poisoned my son before I kill him.

138
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:22,752
Happy birthday to me.

139
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,297
Happy birthday.

140
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,549
Happy birthday.

141
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,724
What the hell is this?

142
00:08:36,807 --> 00:08:38,184
What happened?

143
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:39,101
Hey…

144
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,854
Basil. Galvan.

145
00:08:44,774 --> 00:08:45,983
Basil.

146
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:51,948
I didn't poison Basil…

147
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:53,824
I wasn't the Palacios killer,

148
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,911
and I certainly wasn't the mastermind.

149
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,748
You animal.

150
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,712
I was right all along.

151
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:10,007
You ordered Amando to kill my father.

152
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,759
No, Samantha.

153
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:15,680
I didn't order Amando.

154
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:21,894
If he did kill Orly, he did it on his own.

155
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:24,981
- Sam, Aunt Aurora…
- Stay out of this, Jericho.

156
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:27,650
If you didn't order him,
why would he kill my father?

157
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,443
What is Amando's reason?

158
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,487
Jealousy, Samantha.

159
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,491
Ever since I gave birth to Paco,

160
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,413
Amando hoped that
we would be a family, even though

161
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:43,124
I've told him over and over again that

162
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:46,252
that would never happen.

163
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:48,004
Amando…

164
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:53,342
not everyone we love loves us back.

165
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:59,056
I trust you with my life.

166
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:05,396
I feel safe
and protected when I'm with you.

167
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,110
But, that's all there is for us.

168
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,863
I loved you, Aurora.

169
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,990
Yes, Amando,

170
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:19,952
but you knew I could never love you.

171
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:23,289
I'm a Palacios.

172
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:26,834
And you, you said it yourself,

173
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,378
you're just a lowly servant.

174
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,682
Until your father and I got back together.

175
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:43,851
Got back together?

176
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,937
You were just my wife's mistress.

177
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:49,106
Oh, shut up, Mercy.

178
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,193
Just accept the fact

179
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,987
that I was Orly's first and true love.

180
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,115
Yes, I became his mistress
because you were married,

181
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,036
but it doesn't change the fact
that we still got back together,

182
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:03,996
which angered Amando.

183
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,875
He was very angry with Orly,
but he couldn't do anything

184
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,585
because I loved Orly, Sam.

185
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,087
You're a liar.

186
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,297
You're a liar.

187
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:14,882
You had him killed.

188
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:17,301
You ordered Amando
because you couldn't accept

189
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:20,513
that he would go back to his family,
that he would leave you.

190
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,722
No.

191
00:11:21,806 --> 00:11:24,225
That's not true, Sam.

192
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,686
I don't know what Amando did.

193
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,940
If I only knew that he killed Orly,

194
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,234
I would have put him in prison then.

195
00:11:33,984 --> 00:11:39,073
Yes, I was angry with Orly
when your father left me,

196
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:43,035
but I never once thought
of killing him, Samantha.

197
00:11:44,412 --> 00:11:45,287
Orly, wait!

198
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:47,832
- Orly.
- What?

199
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,960
Please, I'm sorry.

200
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,878
It's just…

201
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,298
Paco will never accept you.

202
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,384
He will hate me to death.

203
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,887
Why don't we do this…

204
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,807
Let's continue our relationship,

205
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:08,227
but we can't tell Paco.

206
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,688
And be your kept man forever?

207
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:12,857
No, Aurora.

208
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:17,319
I'm so stupid.

209
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,447
Why did I choose you?

210
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,074
I left my family… just for you.

211
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,451
Orly, calm down.

212
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,286
- Orly, please…
- No.

213
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:27,455
Let's break up for good.

214
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:32,376
I'll go back to my family
and you'll never see me again.

215
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,086
What?

216
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:35,754
No.

217
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,132
Try to leave me,

218
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,551
I'll kill you.

219
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,015
Do you think I'm afraid of your threats?

220
00:12:50,769 --> 00:12:52,813
Yes, I've threatened him,

221
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,733
but I didn't mean any of it.

222
00:12:57,026 --> 00:13:02,615
I would never kill
the only man I loved, Sam.

223
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,619
I will love him for the rest of my life.

224
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,538
Did you love him?

225
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,583
If you really loved him,

226
00:13:13,792 --> 00:13:17,004
why did you believe
he overdosed when he died?

227
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,133
You didn't seek justice for him.

228
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,259
Why?

229
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,386
To tell you the truth,

230
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:29,391
when Orly left me,

231
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,770
I ordered Amando

232
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,608
to destroy your father
because of my anger.

233
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,651
But,

234
00:13:38,734 --> 00:13:42,112
to destroy, not kill, Sam.

235
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:44,740
And the truth is…

236
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,827
Orly became an addict.

237
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,007
Amando.

238
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,726
Amando introduced him to heroin.

239
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:16,730
Orly was worried

240
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,567
about how to go back to you

241
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,489
because he knew
you were mad at him, Mercy.

242
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,950
He was drunk every night,

243
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:34,123
so maybe Amando
influenced him to use heroin,

244
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,877
until…

245
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:43,674
he was found dead in his apartment

246
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,468
from an overdose.

247
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,638
I was scared, Sam,

248
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:52,850
that the name Palacios
would get associated.

249
00:14:57,146 --> 00:15:03,152
Paco, thank God you answered my call.

250
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,820
Come home.

251
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,406
Let's talk about this mess, Paco.

252
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,785
I can't stand you being away from me.

253
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,413
It's over, Son.
Orly and I are no longer together.

254
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:16,874
Paco?

255
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:18,417
Paco…

256
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,522
Madam…

257
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,737
Doc Orly is gone.

258
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,199
He's dead.

259
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,634
I thought…

260
00:16:10,803 --> 00:16:13,597
He really overdosed, Sam.

261
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:19,478
I didn't think Amando did it on purpose.

262
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:24,650
Amando killed Orly.

263
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,490
You're an animal, Amando. You killed Orly.

264
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,997
Give me my gun, Jericho.

265
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,082
- Ma'am Aurora, where are you going?
- Give it to me.

266
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,544
I'll look for Amando. I will kill him.

267
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,265
Amando Namas.

268
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,143
Put your hands up.

269
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:45,856
You are under arrest
for the murder of Orly Castillo.

270
00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,861
Did you kill Doc Orly?

271
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,780
You are really a beast.

272
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,164
George…

273
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,041
George, we heard some gunshots.

274
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,129
Yes, sis. But, it's not from here
in dad's house. It's from outside.

275
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,465
My God… Thank God you're okay.

276
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,218
But, we're still worried.

277
00:18:56,718 --> 00:18:59,638
What if dad and Amando's paths crossed?

278
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,015
My God, I hope he didn't kill dad.

279
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,769
Sis, I'll get back to you.

280
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,188
Sergeant Tupaz will contact
Sergeant Royales

281
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,982
to find out what's happening outside.

282
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,484
Don't go out of the house, please.

283
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,657
Sergeant Royales, please respond.

284
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:20,492
What's the situation there?

285
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,287
<i>Suspect down, Sarge, but alive.</i>

286
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,164
<i>He was about to stab Mr. Palacios.</i>

287
00:19:25,247 --> 00:19:26,790
<i>It's a good thing I was able to shoot him.</i>

288
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,460
<i>Contact the backup.</i>
<i>10:52, need an ambulance.</i>

289
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:35,340
Sis, I was right.
Dad and Amando had an encounter,

290
00:19:35,424 --> 00:19:38,177
but Sergeant Royales got there.

291
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,095
He shot Amando.

292
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,014
What?

293
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:46,393
Yes, but Sergeant Tupaz advised us
not to go out yet

294
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,770
until the whole compound is secured.

295
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,148
Amando might still have accomplices.

296
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:53,859
Update me.

297
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,099
George?

298
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,352
Sam.

299
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:32,856
Ruth.

300
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,780
Our grandson.

301
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,992
- So cute, right?
- Yes.

302
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,872
Oh, my.

303
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,832
Dad?

304
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:53,585
- Dad.
- Sofia.

305
00:20:55,545 --> 00:20:57,965
I'm fine. I'm okay.

306
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:20,779
Wait.

307
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:30,914
Amando, you monster.

308
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,209
You killed Orly.

309
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:39,047
Sam,

310
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,425
Mercy…

311
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,971
Forgive me.

312
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,434
When my grandson grows up,

313
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,564
please ask forgiveness for me

314
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,108
for killing

315
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:02,404
his other grandfather.

316
00:22:13,373 --> 00:22:15,292
Tell me the truth,

317
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:21,089
did Mom Aurora order you to kill my dad?

318
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,482
Aurora has nothing to do with

319
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:42,569
what I did to Orly.

320
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,743
I killed

321
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:52,412
Orly

322
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,085
because I love Aurora.

323
00:23:01,088 --> 00:23:03,340
Forgive me, please.

324
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,178
Aurora,

325
00:23:10,597 --> 00:23:14,601
I love you so much.

326
00:23:16,311 --> 00:23:17,312
I loved you, Aurora.

327
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,231
Yes, Amando,

328
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,401
but you knew I could never love you.

329
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,780
I'm a Palacios

330
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,200
and you said it yourself,

331
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:32,828
you're just a lowly servant.

332
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,500
Forgive me.

333
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,129
He's coding. Start CPR.

334
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:43,588
Excuse me.

335
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:44,756
Excuse me.

336
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:16,288
Sir, what are the Palacioses plans
for the victims of this massacre?

337
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:19,207
Aside from the burial assistance,

338
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,335
we will only take care
of the families that were orphaned.

339
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:28,925
And we will make sure
that the person behind the killings,

340
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,512
the Palacioses butler,
whom they have entrusted

341
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,222
their lives to, will not escape justice.

342
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:37,142
It's Amando Namas.

343
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,269
Okay. Thank you, sir.

344
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,813
We'll just wait for the update
from your family.

345
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:43,565
Thank you.

346
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:04,586
Amando Namas is comatose,
but I still had him handcuffed

347
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:05,879
and stationed some guards.

348
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,924
My goodness, Sergeant Royales.

349
00:25:09,883 --> 00:25:11,718
If Amando is in a coma,

350
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:16,097
it means he can't even
move within his bed.

351
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,392
Why do you need to handcuff and guard him?

352
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:24,314
If the real mastermind
of the Palacios killings still roams free,

353
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:30,403
he or she can
still plan for Amando's escape.

354
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,992
What are you talking about Galvan?

355
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:42,540
Do you also believe
that I am the real mastermind

356
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,210
in killing our family members?

357
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:49,547
Auntie Aurora, you have the motives,

358
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,509
means, and opportunities.

359
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:00,058
If there's someone
who should be handcuffed now,

360
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,227
maybe it's you, not Amando.

361
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:10,193
What, Sam?

362
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,029
Are you happy now

363
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:17,033
with your desire
to seek revenge for your father?

364
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:22,664
You are poisoning
all the minds of the people in our family.

365
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,836
I am just starting.

366
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:33,466
I will do everything to put you in jail.

367
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:37,470
Aren't you fed up, Sam?

368
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,557
Because I am tired already.

369
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:49,274
You took away
all the important people in my life.

370
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,569
Paco…

371
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,281
Rebecca…

372
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,826
and my grandchildren.

373
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,953
That's why I give up.

374
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:14,132
Here,

375
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,135
Sergeant Royales.

376
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:19,721
Arrest me.

377
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:26,519
If this will bring peace
to all of us, put me in jail.

378
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:30,523
For all the sins they are accusing me of,

379
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:32,400
go ahead.

380
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,952
What are you waiting for, Sergeant?

381
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,373
Arrest me.

382
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:51,544
Put me in jail
because everything they said is true.

383
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:56,132
I am savage, greedy,

384
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,969
and evil.

385
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,724
That's why I lost
all the people I love one by one.

386
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:10,563
Orly, Paco, Rebecca,
and my grandchildren.

387
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:17,737
And even Amando,
who did nothing all his life

388
00:28:17,821 --> 00:28:19,656
but serve me.

389
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,491
I put him in danger.

390
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,743
I pushed him into evil.

391
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,955
I made him a murderer.

392
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,717
I'm sorry, Galvan.

393
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:46,641
I'm sorry to all of you.

394
00:28:49,853 --> 00:28:55,817
If this is the only way
for our family to be at peace,

395
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,029
I'm willing to go to jail.

396
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,296
Sergeant Royales,

397
00:29:18,298 --> 00:29:19,299
please.

398
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:23,303
Ms. Aurora, I'm sorry.

399
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:28,892
Unless you admit to a specific crime,
I can't put you in jail.

400
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:32,228
Do you want to confess something?

401
00:29:32,729 --> 00:29:36,816
Are you and Amando Namas the masterminds

402
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:39,694
in the series of murders
at the Palacios Estate?

403
00:29:58,004 --> 00:29:59,631
Is everything complete?
Nothing is left behind.

404
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,549
- I think there's nothing.
- Okay.

405
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,179
Are you happy, Sam?

406
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,765
Auntie Aurora already surrendered to you.

407
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,769
She apologized for all the evil things
she did to all of us.

408
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:20,401
She still didn't admit
that she ordered Amando to kill dad.

409
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,531
She didn't admit anything
that would put her behind bars.

410
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,203
You know, George…

411
00:30:31,913 --> 00:30:34,290
this is not the ending I dreamed of.

412
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,961
I thought when I married Paco,

413
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,798
we'd grow old together…

414
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,885
with our future children.

415
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,101
Me too.

416
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:57,772
I thought Basil
and I would build our own family.

417
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:02,735
Quiet, happy, and loving each other.

418
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:05,738
I didn't really want to be rich.

419
00:31:07,323 --> 00:31:08,157
But, it's okay.

420
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:10,285
Even if that didn't push through.

421
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:15,081
At least my being a Palacios paved the way
to rebuild our friendship.

422
00:31:43,234 --> 00:31:44,777
Are you really leaving?

423
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,780
Dad, don't worry.

424
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,867
Just because we're leaving
this place it doesn't mean

425
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:54,746
we're cutting off our communication
with you and Auntie Aurora.

426
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:57,540
Promise, we'll always be here.

427
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,959
We'll bring the baby here to see you.

428
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,633
Even if we turn the situation around,

429
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:10,845
we still can't erase the fact…

430
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:14,891
that our son is yours
and Mom Aurora's grandchild.

431
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,603
If you still consider us a family,

432
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:21,356
join us tomorrow night.

433
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:25,818
Aurora is hosting a dinner
for all surviving Palacioses.

434
00:32:29,238 --> 00:32:31,115
For all of us to reconcile…

435
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,785
to move on from everything.

436
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,375
What do you think, Sam?

437
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,468
To this day,
dad has not been given justice.

438
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,972
It is difficult to move on.

439
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,600
Sam…

440
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,729
I will not force you
if you're having a hard time moving on.

441
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:06,025
But, Aurora is extending an olive branch.

442
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:07,735
A peace offering.

443
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:11,489
I am not asking you to forgive her,

444
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,784
but what I'm asking

445
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,537
is before you leave,

446
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,039
I hope we'll be together for dinner.

447
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:24,627
You know, come to think of it,

448
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:28,423
I can't remember
all of us having dinner together.

449
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,096
Sam?

450
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:49,235
Thank you for granting my request

451
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,654
to be with you tonight

452
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:57,869
after the ordeal that we all went through.

453
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:02,457
Auntie Aurora, I've been meaning to ask.

454
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,251
How come we're the only ones invited?

455
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:10,214
I will talk to them
at another time, Sofia.

456
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,259
For now, this…

457
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:18,598
us, Palacioses, by blood and by marriage,

458
00:34:18,681 --> 00:34:20,850
are the ones I invited.

459
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,188
Well, I didn't come here for you.

460
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:34,197
I only came here
because Uncle Galvan begged me.

461
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,201
Oh, Rebecca, you don't mean that.

462
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:43,039
Otherwise, after hearing
what happened to the family,

463
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:46,584
you wouldn't have call me worried and ask…

464
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:50,671
how's mom, right?

465
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,675
I meant Auntie Aurora.

466
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:57,762
You said mom.

467
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:19,367
Rebecca, thank you.

468
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,247
I must admit the entire time
we were trapped inside the house.

469
00:35:24,997 --> 00:35:26,415
I was happy…

470
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:30,670
with your decision to leave me

471
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,882
because you and your children are safe.

472
00:35:42,598 --> 00:35:45,601
I thought I could handle it
without you in my life.

473
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,274
But I couldn't bear
the thought of losing you.

474
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:55,736
Because I still love you

475
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,199
even if you committed
a lot of sins against me.

476
00:36:04,412 --> 00:36:06,455
I admit to…

477
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:11,460
all my sins against you…

478
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,921
What I did to you

479
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,133
and my grandchildren.

480
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:20,803
To all our families…

481
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,098
Rebecca,

482
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,102
I will keep on saying this to you,

483
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,230
please forgive me.

484
00:36:49,165 --> 00:36:51,667
We're going home, Mom.

485
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,130
My twins and I are going home,

486
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,716
so they can be with their grandmother.

487
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:11,520
I am truly sorry, Rebecca, my child.

488
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:26,410
I hope you can forgive me too,
Auntie Aurora

489
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:33,626
because of the stress I gave you.

490
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:41,259
For exposing to you and Uncle Galvan

491
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,636
that I am a Palacios.

492
00:37:44,887 --> 00:37:48,891
I really wanted to experience
having a family.

493
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:51,811
Jericho,

494
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,439
I should apologize to you

495
00:37:57,108 --> 00:38:00,820
because I didn't accept you
right away as a Palacios.

496
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,198
But, despite everything,

497
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,326
you still saved me

498
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,706
and the rest of our family.

499
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:14,917
You are my family,

500
00:38:16,502 --> 00:38:18,629
so it's my duty to save all of you.

501
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:28,597
But, until now it seems like
I still haven't forgiven myself

502
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,190
because I failed to save Basil

503
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:43,029
from Amando.

504
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:49,577
Beverly, Peter,

505
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:51,662
and Francis

506
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,956
got involved too.

507
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,922
Jericho, don't blame yourself.

508
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,511
George is right.

509
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,891
You are not to blame for what happened.

510
00:39:13,642 --> 00:39:15,269
It's Amando.

511
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,273
If he's the real mastermind of everything.

512
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:23,778
He should be blamed.

513
00:39:38,167 --> 00:39:41,379
Well… this is great.

514
00:39:41,462 --> 00:39:44,632
Now that we've asked
forgiveness from each other.

515
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:48,219
Let's continue the celebration.

516
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,015
Uncle Galvan,

517
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:56,811
won't you ask for forgiveness
from Auntie Aurora?

518
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:01,690
No need to, Jericho.

519
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:06,779
With all the things
that we did to each other,

520
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,989
I think we're even.

521
00:40:09,782 --> 00:40:10,783
Right, Galvan?

522
00:40:12,034 --> 00:40:14,537
But if we want to have a good start,

523
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:21,001
I think it's okay to admit
all the wrong things we did,

524
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:25,673
especially since

525
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,009
Paco is involved.

526
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,765
What about Paco?

527
00:40:39,645 --> 00:40:40,813
Galvan…

528
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,067
I'm asking you.

529
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:48,154
What did you do to Paco?

530
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:19,977
You?

531
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,732
Galvan, you burned Paco?

532
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,568
You animal.

533
00:41:28,277 --> 00:41:30,112
How could you do that to my son?

534
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,364
How could you do that to your nephew?

535
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:33,949
Yes, Aurora.

536
00:41:34,575 --> 00:41:36,368
I burned him

537
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,913
because you deprived me and my son.

538
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:44,293
You didn't agree to make Basil taxidermy,

539
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,505
so I could still be with him up to now.

540
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,093
I miss my son so much…

541
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,971
even if I say I'm okay now.

542
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,766
I still miss Basil very much.

543
00:42:05,981 --> 00:42:07,733
Aurora, I'm sorry.

544
00:42:11,195 --> 00:42:12,905
Please forgive me

545
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,283
for what I did to Paco.

546
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,581
And to all of you.

547
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,334
I'm sorry

548
00:42:25,834 --> 00:42:28,837
about what happened
to the Palacios Estate.

549
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,341
Forgive me.

550
00:42:35,469 --> 00:42:37,513
- I'm sorry.
- Galvan.

551
00:42:44,895 --> 00:42:46,313
Forgive me.

552
00:42:51,944 --> 00:42:53,571
Thank you, Uncle Galvan.

553
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:56,031
Now that we've forgiven each other,

554
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:01,787
I'm sure the Palacios family
can finally start anew.

555
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,473
Rico,

556
00:43:21,557 --> 00:43:24,101
I think this is the right time

557
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:29,607
to bring out the special champagne
I prepared

558
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:31,942
so we can all share.

559
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:56,216
All right, give everyone a drink
including the staff.

560
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,229
Cheers to peace and harmony
of the Palacios family

561
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:13,734
with the entire Palacios group
of companies.

562
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,000
More champagne please.

563
00:44:53,941 --> 00:44:55,234
Aurora.

564
00:44:55,317 --> 00:44:56,527
Jericho?

565
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,864
I think the Palacios killer
is still alive.

566
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,617
He poisoned all of us.

567
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:06,662
My son… he's with Mom.

568
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,372
They're together in the room.

569
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,540
My son…

570
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:13,502
Mom and Ward are alone at home.

571
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,729
Aurora…

572
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:38,735
Galvan…

573
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:48,370
Galvan, forgive me.

574
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,207
I forgive you too.

575
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:29,995
Sergeant Royales…
I need to talk to Sergeant Royales.

576
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,129
<i>Miss Samantha…</i>

577
00:46:39,213 --> 00:46:40,422
<i>Hello?</i>

578
00:46:40,506 --> 00:46:41,507
<i>Miss Samantha?</i>

579
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,432
Sam?

580
00:46:58,607 --> 00:46:59,858
Sam.

581
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:09,910
I'm sorry.

582
00:47:29,721 --> 00:47:30,722
Ms. Samantha?

583
00:47:34,226 --> 00:47:36,019
Breaker 1-9,

584
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:39,314
confirm if paramedics
and ambulance are en route

585
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:41,358
to the Palacios residence.

586
00:47:41,441 --> 00:47:43,318
We need to expedite, ASAP.

587
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:49,199
Verify if all necessary staff
and equipment are onboard. Over.

588
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:51,285
<i>Roger, sir. Affirmative.</i>

589
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:39,666
We have taken revenge.

590
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,795
Coming back from the States was worth it.

591
00:48:45,672 --> 00:48:50,052
I finally brought justice to
what these monsters brought to my parents.

592
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:54,765
Why?

593
00:48:57,517 --> 00:49:01,480
I just realized, we became murderers
like the Palacioses.

594
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:08,153
Rico, they are the reason
we became like this.

595
00:49:11,281 --> 00:49:14,451
They killed our loved ones.

596
00:49:17,704 --> 00:49:21,958
Grandfather, Father, Uncle Bong.

597
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,922
They put up a union
to take care of the miners

598
00:49:27,506 --> 00:49:30,425
and not to fight the Palacioses

599
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:34,763
But, what?

600
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:38,100
But, what did these people do?

601
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:43,397
They burned our house.

602
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,524
My entire family died.

603
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,859
Rico, I was the only one…

604
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:53,156
I was the only one who survived.

605
00:49:56,368 --> 00:49:58,578
I lived on the streets,

606
00:49:59,371 --> 00:50:00,747
begged,

607
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:04,126
and became a snatcher just to live.

608
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,421
You are right, Cairo.

609
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,215
There's no need to be guilty.

610
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:15,887
My parents were killed
when Manuela Gamboa allegedly

611
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:20,183
threw dynamite at the miners
who refused to join the union.

612
00:50:20,892 --> 00:50:22,269
But, the truth is,

613
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,564
you did this.

614
00:50:27,232 --> 00:50:30,569
You sacrificed the lives
of more than 50 miners

615
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,863
including Mom and Dad.

616
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:37,659
And then they accused Manuela.

617
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:41,121
I lost everything.

618
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:46,209
My parents, my home, my life.

619
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:54,050
An American couple adopted me, but

620
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:58,972
instead of love, they hurt me.

621
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:04,186
They beat me, abused me.

622
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,397
I was like dirt

623
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:11,193
and it's all because of you.

624
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:15,322
You destroyed my family.

625
00:51:15,822 --> 00:51:17,449
And you destroyed me.

626
00:51:27,083 --> 00:51:28,084
George,

627
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:30,170
I'm sorry.

628
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:34,591
We had no plans
to kill the Palacioses at first,

629
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:38,637
until we found out
how evil this family is.

630
00:52:26,476 --> 00:52:29,813
<i>Especially Ma'am Aurora and Sir Galvan.</i>

631
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:33,358
<i>That's why we chose to mess up your lives</i>

632
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:36,903
<i>So, you will end up killing each other.</i>

633
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,910
Buy some more wine. Two bottles, okay?

634
00:52:43,994 --> 00:52:46,079
So, Mother and I can have one bottle each.

635
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,708
Ward, get your sister's bag.

636
00:52:53,169 --> 00:52:54,087
Oh, my.

637
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:49,935
But, that didn't happen
because you didn't do anything.

638
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,772
All you did was accuse
and fight each other.

639
00:53:54,272 --> 00:53:56,775
That's why we've decided
to poison all of you

640
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,362
to end the evil in this family.

641
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,843
There. That's what you deserve.

642
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:31,351
Sofia.

643
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:35,981
Sofia, my child.

644
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:39,401
Sofia, my child.

645
00:54:39,484 --> 00:54:42,612
Sofia.

646
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:50,286
Animals.

647
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,122
Animals.

648
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:57,836
Didn't I tell you not
to touch my daughter?

649
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,879
We talked about that, remember?

650
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,341
I told you we will seek revenge
on the Palacioses.

651
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:06,136
We will seek revenge, but not my daughter.

652
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,346
You fools.

653
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,767
Ms. Vivian…

654
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:15,103
I helped you…

655
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:17,814
I helped you with what you wanted to do.

656
00:55:17,897 --> 00:55:21,151
But, my first request

657
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:23,236
you didn't even grant it.

658
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:28,074
You poisoned my daughter
so you should be poisoned too.

659
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,492
You should die too.

660
00:55:30,076 --> 00:55:33,246
Ms. Vivian, stop it. Stop it, Ms. Vivian.

661
00:55:33,329 --> 00:55:35,123
I will blow your brains out.

662
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:37,834
Which one here has poison?
Is this the one?

663
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:39,085
Here, this one.

664
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,795
Drink this.

665
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:42,714
Hold this. Drink it.

666
00:55:42,797 --> 00:55:44,591
Drink the poison.

667
00:55:44,674 --> 00:55:46,843
Rico, get that.

668
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:49,304
Get it. Get it.

669
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,972
Drink it.

670
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:53,516
Drink it or else your head will explode.

671
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:55,602
Animals.

672
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,025
Jericho?

673
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,651
Jericho?

674
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,575
- It's a failure.
- You talk too much.

675
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,077
NEXT EPISODE

676
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:14,370
Hands up.

677
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:18,333
Good thing you came.
We found them lying on the floor.

678
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,417
I think they were poisoned.

679
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,419
- We think that…
- I know the truth, Jericho.

680
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:25,256
Run.

681
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,633
Come on. Cairo.

682
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:28,426
Go ahead. Stop them
or else I will kill her.

683
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:30,136
No breathing.

684
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,513
No pulse.

685
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,764
George?

686
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:35,183
George.
