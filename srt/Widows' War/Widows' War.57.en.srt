1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,266
It seems that it wasn't Sir Amando
who ran over Francis.

2
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:17,392
He has a strong alibi.

3
00:00:17,475 --> 00:00:20,145
On the night
that Mr. Castillo was run over,

4
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:23,064
they were together purchasing supplies

5
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:24,232
for the house staff.

6
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,277
If it's not Amando, then who?

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,779
I don't have a problem sharing
my father with anyone.

8
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:30,905
So, why is it a big deal for you?

9
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,782
Because I want you

10
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:36,661
to be the lone heir, Sofia.

11
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:40,123
Whatever or whoever stands

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,499
in the way must be gone.

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,668
Okay, what will it be?

14
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,128
What will it be? There.

15
00:00:45,211 --> 00:00:48,006
You're the lucky one. Come on.

16
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,258
Oh, my.

17
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:52,594
Oh, my God.

18
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,929
PREVIOUSLY

19
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:57,265
George, I will do anything.

20
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:58,975
Just forgive me. I will do anything.

21
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,102
You will give me your baby.

22
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:04,397
That's my condition
if you want me to forgive you.

23
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,107
Ten million pesos.

24
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,359
All I want

25
00:01:08,443 --> 00:01:09,778
is for her to be disabled
just like what happened to me.

26
00:01:09,861 --> 00:01:11,488
That's your Plan A, Dad?

27
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,786
It looks like George and I
will never be okay, Mother.

28
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,164
She can only forgive me

29
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,083
if I give her my baby.

30
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:24,167
What?

31
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,711
Not in a million years.

32
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:31,549
I will be six feet under
before that happens, Samantha.

33
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,219
Georgina will never have your baby.

34
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,096
No one can get your baby.

35
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:39,182
No one can get my grandchild.

36
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,684
Except you?

37
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:56,282
Cairo, leave us first.

38
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,884
Yes, George.

39
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:17,387
That's my Plan A.

40
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:21,474
I want to hurt Sam
for what she did to my grandson.

41
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,311
Dad, I will not agree to your plan.

42
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:27,480
She killed your baby,

43
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,607
my grandchild.

44
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,902
She deserves to be punished.

45
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,656
I don't want to see her
happily giving birth to her baby

46
00:02:36,739 --> 00:02:40,827
while you are grieving over baby Basil.

47
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:44,831
Not with the plan I have in mind.

48
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,292
She will be grieving.

49
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,462
What do you mean?

50
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,133
We will steal her baby.

51
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:06,269
Neither you, nor George,

52
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,731
nor anyone else can get my baby.

53
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:13,651
George can't, but I can.

54
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,947
I am Aurora Palacios.

55
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,949
A lot of people can help me…

56
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,075
Shut up.

57
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,455
Stop bragging about your name.

58
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:27,290
You need to kill me first

59
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:29,334
before you can get my baby.

60
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:33,379
Oh, Sam. I think I said this before.

61
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,300
Killing you is not the only way

62
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,177
for me to get my grandchild.

63
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:44,182
I have more than a hundred and one ways

64
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,683
to get what I want.

65
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,686
I don't care about your plan…

66
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:52,815
because I will make sure
that before I give birth

67
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:54,943
you'll be behind bars.

68
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,194
So,

69
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,279
you're still stuck

70
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,157
with the death of Francis,

71
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:04,494
and you're still accusing me, Sam?

72
00:04:04,577 --> 00:04:06,329
Move on already.

73
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,331
Because no matter what you do,

74
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,500
you can't find anything against me

75
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,754
because I didn't kill
your brother, Francis.

76
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,839
Look at Amando.

77
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:20,051
You accused him of carrying out my orders.

78
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,552
What happened?

79
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,555
You were just humiliated, right?

80
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,143
You're Aurora Palacios, right?

81
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:31,980
You can order anyone,

82
00:04:32,063 --> 00:04:33,982
not only Amando.

83
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,777
That's why I will look
for the monster you ordered

84
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,487
to kill my brother.

85
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,698
I am innocent.

86
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:43,825
I will only believe you're innocent

87
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,202
if I find that person

88
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,204
and he says to my face

89
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,914
that you didn't give him orders.

90
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:51,040
Fine.

91
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:55,878
Then let me help you catch the real person

92
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,589
responsible for your brother's death.

93
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,260
So that you don't always accuse me.

94
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:14,814
Are you saying you'll try to beat Aurora?

95
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,525
No, Dad.

96
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,611
We will help Auntie Aurora take the baby,

97
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,448
and then we'll steal the baby
from Auntie Aurora.

98
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:25,366
How?

99
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,247
We will still sue Sam.

100
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:33,291
Once she is in jail,

101
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:37,837
it will be easier
for Auntie Aurora to get the baby.

102
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,840
And then we'll steal the baby
from Auntie Aurora.

103
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,228
Sir Galvan, excuse me. Attorney is here.

104
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:56,230
Compadre.

105
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,066
Compadre.

106
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,654
I'm ready to discuss the case
against Samantha Palacios.

107
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,157
Good.

108
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:23,257
I don't need your help.

109
00:06:24,383 --> 00:06:25,676
How conceited.

110
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,137
I'm already helping you, Samantha.

111
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,306
You're not helping me.

112
00:06:30,389 --> 00:06:34,352
You're only helping yourself

113
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:37,480
because you want to escape
from what you did to my brother

114
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,733
by looking for someone
to point your finger at.

115
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,611
That's absurd.

116
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,865
I'm not stupid.

117
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:52,203
I'm not too stupid
to know what you're doing.

118
00:06:57,041 --> 00:07:00,628
Mother, let's leave before I blow my top.

119
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:13,182
Reckless imprudence resulting
in unintentional abortion.

120
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,018
How many years
will Sam be imprisoned, if ever?

121
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,023
Six to twelve years.

122
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,153
But, let's not get ahead of things.

123
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,030
because there is no witness
to what happened.

124
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:32,618
It's going to be Georgina's words
against Samantha's.

125
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,831
Well, we can always--

126
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:39,292
I know what you're thinking, compadre.

127
00:07:39,834 --> 00:07:41,127
I know you.

128
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:48,384
But, no. I will not allow you

129
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:51,596
to fabricate evidence and witnesses

130
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,347
so we can win this case.

131
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,396
You will only put
your daughter-in-law in danger.

132
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,233
But, do I stand a chance, Attorney?

133
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:08,154
Of course. You have medical records
to show

134
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:11,407
the injuries that happened
because of your fall,

135
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:14,452
which can show if that was the result

136
00:08:14,535 --> 00:08:18,748
of her pushing you,
or if you tripped accidentally.

137
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:23,711
Forensics can search
for additional evidence

138
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,463
to support your claim.

139
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,634
The problem is we weren't able
to have it investigated right away.

140
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:31,928
And the stairs have already been cleaned.

141
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,555
They won't find any traces

142
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,517
of how Sam pushed me. That's why I fell.

143
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:41,395
You said before this encounter,

144
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:44,732
Sam was accusing your brother

145
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:47,026
of running over her brother.

146
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,820
- And there are witnesses?
- Yes.

147
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:53,574
Sergeant Royales and Sergeant Tupaz
witnessed it.

148
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:57,662
Well, that's what we're going
to use against Samantha

149
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:01,457
because that's her motive for hurting you.

150
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,346
How was your talk with Ma'am George?

151
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:17,682
She still doesn't want to forgive me.

152
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,893
Just continue wooing her.

153
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,773
No, Jericho.

154
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:28,734
They will never patch things up.

155
00:09:30,611 --> 00:09:33,656
Sam, you better prepare yourself.

156
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:38,911
George already talked to Galvan's lawyer

157
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,621
and they will sue you.

158
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,332
I didn't mean what happened.

159
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:47,503
Don't get pissed or mad at me.

160
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,629
Get pissed with George.

161
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:52,008
She's the one who is insistent

162
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,885
that you pushed her off the stairs.

163
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,763
If it were just me, Sam, I would believe

164
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,642
that it was just an accident,
and that you are innocent.

165
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,480
Well, then. I'll go home now.

166
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,109
I just came here to warn you.

167
00:10:10,901 --> 00:10:14,113
That's a warning, Sam, not a rumor.

168
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:15,990
I'll go ahead.

169
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:28,127
I hope you don't end up in court.

170
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,380
I regret that this has happened
to your friendship.

171
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,592
We need to get closer to them,
so we can hear what they're talking about.

172
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,260
Don't get too close.

173
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:38,596
Sam.

174
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:41,515
Jericho, thank you.

175
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,768
What are you doing here?

176
00:10:44,435 --> 00:10:47,271
We're spying on Mom Aurora
and Uncle Galvan.

177
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,939
You should be on each other's side.

178
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:52,652
I did everything for her to forgive me,

179
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:57,114
but nothing… If she wants
to sue me then go ahead.

180
00:10:57,198 --> 00:10:58,574
I will face her in court.

181
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:03,537
I need to focus
on looking for justice for my brother.

182
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,540
Ms. Samantha, good evening.

183
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:08,584
The results on the gas masks
that were found

184
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,670
with Ma'am Aurora and Sir Galvan came in.

185
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,171
Even the one from Edward.

186
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,481
Heaven gained another angel.

187
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,358
My baby is gone?

188
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,763
Edward Balay and Amando Namas

189
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:48,476
are officially cleared as suspects
for running over Francis.

190
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:50,394
They have a solid alibi.

191
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,062
How about Uncle Galvan?

192
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,731
And Mom Aurora?

193
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,484
The ones found with Sir Galvan and Edward

194
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,485
have their fingerprints
outside the gas mask,

195
00:12:57,568 --> 00:13:01,030
and Ms. Ruth's, too.

196
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:05,409
But, they admitted to holding it,
but not wearing it.

197
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:07,161
How did you know?

198
00:13:07,244 --> 00:13:10,414
All the gas masks
weren't worn for a long time.

199
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,418
The hair strands and other DNA samples,

200
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:18,130
like worn-out skin cells
that were seen inside the gas masks,

201
00:13:18,797 --> 00:13:22,760
didn't match with any of the Palacioses
or anyone living

202
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:26,514
around the compound.

203
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:29,892
That means the people who last wore them

204
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,936
were the miners who owned them before.

205
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:35,272
But, it's possible that none
of what you confiscated

206
00:13:35,356 --> 00:13:36,941
was used by the Palacios killer.

207
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,735
There are some missing, right?

208
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,532
Three. We suspect one was used
to frame Edward.

209
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:47,326
So, there are two more missing.
Where are they?

210
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,453
They're here at home.

211
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:52,122
George…

212
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,086
I already had Attorney Seraspi draft

213
00:13:57,169 --> 00:13:59,255
the complaint affidavit,

214
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,298
so we can file it in the fiscal office.

215
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,302
I want the case to be expedited,
so Sam will be jailed.

216
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,142
George…

217
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,563
You'll get through this.

218
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,363
I am forcing myself, Dad.

219
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,408
But I can't do it.

220
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,454
I still can't believe
that my baby is gone.

221
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,627
We will make Sam pay.

222
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,905
I still believe it was
Mom Aurora who ordered

223
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,991
to have my mother run over,
which resulted in Francis' death.

224
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:13,746
Jericho, remember we saw
a secret room here?

225
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:15,456
Maybe there are more secret rooms here.

226
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:18,250
Let's look for them.
Maybe the gas masks are there.

227
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:21,337
That's also why we're here.

228
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,671
We have a search warrant.

229
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,256
I'll help with the search.

230
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,508
No, Ms. Samantha. We'll take care of this.

231
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,386
Let her help, Sergeant Tupaz.

232
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:37,603
Aren't you siding too much…

233
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:40,856
with your daughter-in-law, Galvan?

234
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,692
Maybe you've forgotten,

235
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,696
just recently, she doubted you.

236
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:52,284
She thought that you were
one of the Palacios killers

237
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,036
or the mastermind.

238
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:57,414
She and Sam even sided with each other.

239
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,393
- Dad.
- I know, George.

240
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:23,065
But, I can't blame you
because they found a gas mask in my room.

241
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,485
But, I'm innocent.

242
00:16:27,403 --> 00:16:28,904
Let me make it clear.

243
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,782
I am not the Palacios killer

244
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,326
and I am not the mastermind either.

245
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:36,787
George, I've said it.

246
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,832
You're like a daughter to me now.

247
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,042
So, please…

248
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:44,962
don't doubt me.

249
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,175
Let's focus on…

250
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:53,887
our fight against Sam.

251
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,489
Thank you, Dad.

252
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,828
I want to see
the disappointment on this woman's face

253
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:20,956
when you don't find
any gas masks in my house.

254
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,792
And yes, I will assist you.

255
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:29,214
We have two more storage rooms
in the basement.

256
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:30,799
Come on.

257
00:17:35,012 --> 00:17:37,097
Oh, Samantha…

258
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:40,392
I thought you were going.

259
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:45,105
I thought you wanted
to find evidence against me.

260
00:17:45,689 --> 00:17:48,150
Remember, I told you

261
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:53,155
that I would help
in searching for the person

262
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,949
who killed Francis
so you'd stop accusing me.

263
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:08,253
So, what do you want to do now
while waiting for the case to progress?

264
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,758
Do you want to push through with Plan A?

265
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,135
No, Dad.

266
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:17,971
If we hurt Sam,

267
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,140
her baby might get involved.

268
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,018
That will ruin our plan

269
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,729
to steal her baby after she gives birth.

270
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,815
You're going to steal Sam's baby?

271
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,944
You can't do that.

272
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:35,239
And why not, Sofia?

273
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,325
I lost my baby because of Sam.

274
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:40,744
She took my miracle baby.

275
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,621
It's a crime.

276
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,166
Do you think her baby can replace
the baby that you lost?

277
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,334
Yes.

278
00:18:48,418 --> 00:18:49,545
George…

279
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:54,299
Can you love him
even if you know you have no right

280
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:56,093
because he's not yours?

281
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,930
George…

282
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,684
can you love him
even if you know you have no right

283
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,561
because you're not his real mother?

284
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,150
George, if your plan succeeds,

285
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:14,778
I know you can provide
everything he needs…

286
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,406
Except for the truth

287
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,076
that you're not his real mother.

288
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,786
And he doesn't deserve

289
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:26,415
to grow up with lies.

290
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,959
And you, George,

291
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:32,504
will live with a guilty conscience
for the rest of your life.

292
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,821
<i>Can you love him</i>
<i>even if you know you have no right</i>

293
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,698
<i>because he's not yours?</i>

294
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,491
<i>George, if your plan succeeds,</i>

295
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:05,913
<i>I know you can provide</i>
<i>everything he needs…</i>

296
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,415
<i>Except for the truth</i>

297
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:11,835
<i>that you're not his real mother,</i>

298
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,879
<i>and he doesn't deserve</i>

299
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,382
<i>to grow up with lies.</i>

300
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,279
George…

301
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,534
I'm sorry.

302
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:34,084
I know I said
some hurtful words to you earlier.

303
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,046
I didn't mean them.

304
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,301
I admit it.

305
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,303
I got jealous.

306
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:50,309
I was envious of the attention Galvan

307
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,686
was giving you and your family.

308
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,772
That's why I said those things.

309
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,608
But, I've realized…

310
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,320
that I was wrong.

311
00:22:02,487 --> 00:22:04,740
And I'm so sorry, George.

312
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,463
George…

313
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,758
You know if I were you,

314
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,802
I wouldn't allow…

315
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,930
Sam to continue with her pregnancy

316
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,020
after she killed your baby.

317
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:42,152
What? She is happy becoming a mother

318
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:47,657
while you grieve for the rest of your life

319
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,035
because of your baby's death.

320
00:23:01,296 --> 00:23:02,464
George…

321
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:08,011
Avenge your child.

322
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,476
Seek justice for your baby's death.

323
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:21,274
Push Sam from the stairs…

324
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,069
just like she did to you.

325
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,489
Because Sam

326
00:23:28,782 --> 00:23:32,035
killed your baby.

327
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:34,579
George…

328
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:39,167
Sam killed your baby.

329
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,971
Animal. Animal.

330
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:52,514
You're an animal.

331
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:54,349
- Animal. You fool.
- Wait.

332
00:23:54,432 --> 00:23:55,267
Why are you hurting me?

333
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,102
You're a demon.

334
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,896
I will kill you.

335
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,399
- You're a demon.
- It's Sam.

336
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,234
- Hurt Sam.
- George, George.

337
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,237
I don't know about your daughter.

338
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:08,655
- She suddenly attacked me.
- Wait.

339
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:09,865
What did you do to my daughter?

340
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:13,326
I didn't do anything to your daughter.
She suddenly attacked me.

341
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,495
I said sorry to her. I apologized…

342
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,746
- I humbled myself, Ruth.
- No…

343
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:19,499
She wouldn't get mad at you
if you didn't provoke her.

344
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:22,252
- You always start the fight.
- Why me?

345
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:38,852
Please…

346
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,315
Leave.

347
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,901
Please.

348
00:26:44,144 --> 00:26:45,395
George…

349
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,618
Today is baby Basil's memorial.

350
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,755
I will come back for you later.

351
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:17,260
We'll prepare for the memorial.

352
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,559
I will get him now.

353
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,131
Mommy…

354
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:39,217
You really won't attend the memorial?

355
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,179
Okay.

356
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:46,725
Drink medicine. If you'll feel better,

357
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:48,226
just come here.

358
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,943
I've already lost a son, Ruth.

359
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:04,367
I'm sorry, Mr. Galvan.
We have done everything.

360
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:05,744
Basil did not make it.

361
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,789
And my eldest grandson.

362
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:12,542
- It's a boy!
- Wow!

363
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:14,210
- It's a boy!
- Wow!

364
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,724
And now this,

365
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:31,686
my grandchild from George.

366
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,733
I've lost a son

367
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,403
and grandsons,

368
00:29:42,989 --> 00:29:45,200
twice.

369
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:07,263
Where is George by the way?

370
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,476
I asked Ward to check on her.
Maybe he can convince her.

371
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,020
When I went to her earlier,
she refused to come.

372
00:30:16,523 --> 00:30:18,274
Mom. Mom.

373
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,151
Mom, George is missing from her room.

374
00:30:20,235 --> 00:30:21,736
I already searched the whole house

375
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,613
- but she's nowhere to be found.
- What?

376
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:25,406
Where did she go?

377
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:28,993
Jericho, tell everyone to look for George.

378
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,371
Cairo, look for her.

379
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:09,367
Sam, remember what the doctor said, okay.

380
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:11,327
Avoid getting stressed.

381
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:14,497
Mom, I'm trying my best,

382
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,208
but Mom Aurora is really stressing me out.

383
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:21,337
She took Sergeant Royales
to the storage room in the basement.

384
00:31:21,421 --> 00:31:23,506
But, they didn't find any gas masks

385
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,300
similar to that of the Palacios killer.

386
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:28,219
I'm sure Aurora is hiding it,

387
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,513
or she gave it to the person
she gave orders to.

388
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:32,640
Wherever she's hiding it,

389
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:36,269
I will still look for it for Francis,

390
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:38,104
so I can make it up to him,

391
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:40,106
for all the sins I've committed
against him.

392
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,817
Justice for his death.

393
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:45,987
And for your father too.

394
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:49,866
But, no matter
what stress Aurora gives you,

395
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,535
don't get affected.

396
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:56,748
Today is the memorial of George's baby.

397
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:04,964
Sir Galvan.

398
00:32:05,798 --> 00:32:07,717
Ma'am George is not in the compound.

399
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,385
She is not even in Ma'am Aurora's house.

400
00:32:09,469 --> 00:32:10,970
Then where is she?

401
00:32:11,054 --> 00:32:12,180
We don't know.

402
00:32:13,973 --> 00:32:15,725
Uncle Galvan, Ma'am Ruth,

403
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:17,602
George went out.

404
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,228
It was seen on the CCTV
that she went out through the back gate

405
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,605
ten minutes ago.

406
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,232
She hasn't gone far yet.
Bill, get the car.

407
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,276
- Let's look for her.
- Let's go.

408
00:32:26,653 --> 00:32:28,863
You. You stay here.

409
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,379
George?

410
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,007
Driver. Driver, stop the car.

411
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:50,385
- What?
- It's George.

412
00:32:55,932 --> 00:32:57,141
George?

413
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,852
George…

414
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:36,973
George.

415
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:48,901
Sorry.

416
00:33:50,486 --> 00:33:51,946
George, are you okay?

417
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:55,908
George, what are you doing? Come here.

418
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,493
George…

419
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,329
George, say something. What are you doing?

420
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,332
Are you trying to kill yourself, huh?

421
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,837
Yes. Because of you.

422
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,965
Okay, go ahead and get mad at me.

423
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:13,009
Blame me.

424
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,886
Vent your anger towards me,

425
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,055
but don't let your sadness eat you up.

426
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:19,140
Don't give up.

427
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,185
How can I fight back if you're gone?
If you're already dead, George?

428
00:34:22,268 --> 00:34:24,812
Talk to us.
Don't let that beat you, George.

429
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:27,356
We're all here for you.

430
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:31,527
George, what's with you? Talk to us.

431
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,446
Talk to me.

432
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,741
Let's go.

433
00:34:42,497 --> 00:34:43,372
Sam.

434
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,125
What did you do to George?

435
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:47,752
- No. Don't.
- Sir Galvan, don't.

436
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,629
- Don't.
- Don't stop me.

437
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,172
She killed my grandson

438
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,883
and now she's trying to hurt George.

439
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,468
I didn't hurt her.

440
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:56,719
I saw that she was about
to be run over by a car,

441
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:57,762
so I helped her.

442
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:59,222
Liar.

443
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:00,389
She's telling the truth.

444
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,934
We saw George walking
as if she was not in her right mind.

445
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,685
Sam saved her.

446
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:05,603
Ask Ando.

447
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:06,854
That's true, sir.

448
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:34,507
Has the priest arrived?

449
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:36,926
He's nearly here, sir.

450
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,137
Maybe that's him.

451
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:49,856
Did you get all my reminders?

452
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,065
Barbara?

453
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,570
Just let me know and update me.

454
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,782
If I don't answer your call
just email me or message me, okay?

455
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,912
Why didn't anyone tell me
that Barbara Sagrado was coming today?

456
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:22,388
Cairo.

457
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:25,975
Do I look good?

458
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:28,519
Yes, sir.

459
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,105
Are you sure?

460
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,233
You're so handsome, sir.

461
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:40,031
Next time Barbara comes here,
inform me right away.

462
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:41,949
Yes, sir.

463
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:53,419
Auro, you're still not here?

464
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,089
Okay, never mind. I'll just go there.

465
00:37:00,676 --> 00:37:02,511
Okay, fine. Bye.

466
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:03,930
Simon, I'll get out.

467
00:37:04,013 --> 00:37:05,014
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,401
Galvan.

469
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:18,986
Hello, Barbara.

470
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:22,865
My condolences. Auro told me.

471
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,786
Thank you for coming.

472
00:37:29,205 --> 00:37:30,539
Okay, I'll go ahead.

473
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:31,999
I'll just go to Auro.

474
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:20,589
Good thing the memorial was moved.
I was able to make it.

475
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:21,674
What happened?

476
00:38:22,341 --> 00:38:24,844
I don't know and I don't care.

477
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,137
Galvan just texted me.

478
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,180
Sam, do we have to go to the memorial?

479
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:30,433
Mother, I need to comfort George.

480
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:32,810
The nerve.

481
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:35,146
You're so shameless, right?

482
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,900
After you killed Georgina's baby,
you want comfort her?

483
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,068
Grief faker.

484
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,071
Such a wolf in sheep's clothing.

485
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:46,657
Hey, you're really getting on my nerves.

486
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:49,493
You even hurt my mother.
What's your problem?

487
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,706
What do you want me to feel?
Do you want me to be happy for you?

488
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,417
But, you're my best friend's enemy.

489
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,837
And I don't want to see your face
because you are cheap.

490
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,839
Well, then close your eyes.

491
00:39:02,715 --> 00:39:03,966
You're rude.

492
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:11,682
That's for what you did to my mother.

493
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:18,481
Father, let's just wait for George.

494
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:31,369
Ruth, where is George?

495
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:44,632
Just give her time.

496
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,069
Son…

497
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:08,989
please forgive mommy.

498
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:15,121
Forgive me because I failed
to protect you.

499
00:40:17,206 --> 00:40:19,250
I may have not seen you.

500
00:40:21,794 --> 00:40:24,088
I don't even know what you look like.

501
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,050
I love you so much.

502
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:35,975
You will see your daddy in heaven.

503
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,854
Hug him for me, huh?

504
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,363
You bitch.

505
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,406
Barbara.

506
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:52,992
No.

507
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,660
Are you okay?

508
00:40:55,369 --> 00:40:56,829
Yes, I'm fine.

509
00:40:57,496 --> 00:40:58,330
Good.

510
00:41:04,753 --> 00:41:06,964
Don't try to use your witchy ways on me

511
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:08,966
because if you're a bitch, I'm worse.

512
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,969
If you're a monster I can be one too.

513
00:41:12,052 --> 00:41:15,306
Sam, that's enough. Come on let's go home.

514
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:23,731
Be thankful I can still be human.

515
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:30,696
Oh, my goodness.

516
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,781
That woman doesn't know when to stop.

517
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,411
Her audacity knows no bounds, Barry.

518
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:39,747
Just look at

519
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:44,335
what I have to endure every single day.

520
00:41:45,044 --> 00:41:47,129
She should be thankful
that she's carrying my grandchild.

521
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,631
My God.

522
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,175
Because if she weren't,
I'd be the first one to slap her.

523
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,512
I know. I pity you.

524
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,430
I feel sorry for you.

525
00:41:56,514 --> 00:41:58,682
But, anyway. Let's not think about her.

526
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,143
Our mood will only be ruined. Let's go.

527
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,815
I don't want to fight.
I don't want any trouble.

528
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:49,441
I don't want to sue anymore.

529
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,527
I won't allow that woman
not to be held accountable.

530
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,195
I've already made up my mind.

531
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,031
My mind is a mess.
I don't want to add to it.

532
00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,616
George…

533
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,201
I made all of you believe.

534
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,745
I will no longer sue Sam.

535
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,539
I will win her over

536
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,624
and once I get her trust,

537
00:43:05,708 --> 00:43:09,712
it will be easier for me
to get her baby once she gives birth.

538
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:11,547
Ma'am Sam, someone wants you to have this.

539
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:14,049
That's the car that left
the letter and flower.

540
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,093
Can you see the license number?
Can you zoom in?

541
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,303
Yes.

542
00:43:17,386 --> 00:43:20,264
Why were you gone for a year,

543
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:22,641
and when you got back here,
you were so fat?

544
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:23,809
