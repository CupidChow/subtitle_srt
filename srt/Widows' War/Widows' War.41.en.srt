1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,766
‪PREVIOUSLY

2
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:20,437
Paco, my son. You're alive.

3
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,646
Say something, please.

4
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,690
I will take care

5
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:26,192
of everything.

6
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:28,653
- Just say you're tolerating her.
- That's enough.

7
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:30,947
He's just following my orders.

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:32,991
He's the only one I trust.

9
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:35,785
And no one was supposed
to know about this.

10
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,370
You can't hide a dead body.

11
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:39,998
She thinks Paco is alive.
I saw her talking to him.

12
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:42,417
She thinks Paco is replying to her.

13
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:48,506
I suppose you're here to ask questions
about my son, Detective.

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:53,011
There's no law saying
that I can't make my son taxidermy.

15
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,096
Are you leaving?

16
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,431
We're leaving here.

17
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:57,849
The people living here are crazy.

18
00:00:57,932 --> 00:01:00,143
If I were you, I'd leave too.

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,186
Especially you, George.

20
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:02,479
Your child is more important

21
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,606
than being a queen here
at Palacios Estate.

22
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,569
Mrs. Palacios, is it true
that you're talking to your son?

23
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:10,779
Of course not.

24
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:12,447
- Not even once?
- What are you implying?

25
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:14,949
I am not crazy, Detective.

26
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,785
So, Ms. Samantha is lying?

27
00:01:16,868 --> 00:01:19,454
She is a pathological liar.

28
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:22,040
<i>How many times</i>
<i>did you catch her lying, Detective?</i>

29
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,460
What's that smell?

30
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,170
- What's happening?
- Come on, let's hurry.

31
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,714
The fire might catch up to us.

32
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,633
Let's go.

33
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:32,884
Where did the fire come from?

34
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,177
We don't know.

35
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,596
It suddenly caught fire. We just ran.

36
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,264
Could it be that Sam did this?

37
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:41,059
Remember when their house
was also burned down?

38
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:43,561
And that was the start of our suffering.

39
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:48,983
Sarge…

40
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,652
It's Mrs. Palacios. She was left inside.

41
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,820
Let me do it.

42
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:55,156
- I will go back in there.
- Sir Galvan is here.

43
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:58,159
- Where's Aurora?
- Sir Galvan…

44
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,036
Mom? Where is Mom?

45
00:02:02,747 --> 00:02:05,500
- Aurora…
- Mom…

46
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,046
My son, Paco. Where is he?

47
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,548
Where's my son, Sam?

48
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:12,966
Galvan…

49
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,513
- Paco!
- Madam…

50
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,196
Okay. Update us right away.

51
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,574
You take care.

52
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:41,077
What did Jericho say?

53
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:43,329
He and Sergeant Royales are
still waiting for the results

54
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,082
of the investigation of the fire incident.

55
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:50,003
They are trying to find out
if it was an accident,

56
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,005
or if it was done intentionally.

57
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,465
Who could have done this?

58
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,176
Could it have been the killer?

59
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,469
It's possible.

60
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,807
We'll find out after the investigation.

61
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:10,106
This is where Ma'am Aurora
and I first met…

62
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,193
when my father sent me here…

63
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,905
to work for her family.

64
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:21,075
Sam…

65
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:24,162
I agree with your decision
to leave Ma'am Aurora's side.

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,958
Your baby might become involved.

67
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:34,130
That's the only reason
for Ma'am Aurora to live.

68
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:37,842
Thank you.

69
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,553
You take care of Mom.

70
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,932
I hope she gets better.

71
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,350
Sir. Sir.

72
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:46,476
Sir, Ma'am…

73
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,853
Have you seen Ma'am Aurora?

74
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,521
I can't find her.

75
00:03:56,945 --> 00:03:59,322
In fairness to the Palacioses

76
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:02,367
their houses are next to each other

77
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,452
in one compound.

78
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:11,960
That means we'd still bump
into the Castilloses.

79
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,337
George, can we just go back
to the old house,

80
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,714
so that Mercy won't be our neighbor?

81
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,008
The entire estate's electrical facility

82
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,260
was also damaged.

83
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:22,512
It will take some time
for the renovation to be complete.

84
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,848
And besides, Sam has decided
that they will leave.

85
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,475
We won't be living here with them.

86
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,852
Oh, that's great. I'm now okay here.

87
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,272
It's a new start for all of us, isn't it?

88
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,445
George…

89
00:04:41,531 --> 00:04:42,615
Dad?

90
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,455
Let go of me. Don't meddle here.

91
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,957
Stay away from me.

92
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,792
- Sir Galvan.
- Dad.

93
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:56,879
- Sir, let me help you.
- I said, let go of me.

94
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,590
Dad…

95
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,384
I don't need your help.

96
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,386
I'm not weak. I can do this.

97
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,649
Ouch.

98
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:20,653
You're weak, Galvan. You're so weak.

99
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,289
Ma'am Aurora is just resting
inside her room.

100
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:35,376
Didn't I tell you to keep an eye on her?

101
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,086
Yes, sir.

102
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,255
I only went to the kitchen
to get a glass of water,

103
00:05:39,338 --> 00:05:40,882
but when I returned,
she was no longer there.

104
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:42,842
Maybe she just went out.

105
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,343
Ma'am, I've already checked
the entire area,

106
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,720
but I can't find her.

107
00:05:45,803 --> 00:05:47,972
I thought she might be with you.

108
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:49,766
That's your only job,

109
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:52,101
and you can't even do it.

110
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,687
If something happens to Ma'am Aurora,

111
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,856
- all the…
- Amando, please.

112
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:58,858
Calm down.

113
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,985
Nothing will happen
if we blame each other.

114
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,279
Let's just look for Mom now.

115
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,907
- I'll go this way.
- I will check here, sir.

116
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:08,159
Look for Ma'am Aurora. Hurry.

117
00:06:09,619 --> 00:06:11,496
Dad…

118
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:19,295
Cairo…

119
00:06:48,658 --> 00:06:50,243
I hate this chair.

120
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,161
I hate this life.

121
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,916
Dad… Stop saying that.

122
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,502
If you keep thinking negatively,

123
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:02,213
it will take a long time
for you to recover.

124
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:06,884
You need this wheelchair because
your injured leg can't bear weight.

125
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,680
Yes, Sir Galvan.
The doctor said you'll get better.

126
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,640
You just have to do a little therapy.

127
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,686
We won't neglect you.

128
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:19,856
Mom and I are here. We're family.

129
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,399
Family?

130
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,819
This happened to me because of family.

131
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:27,405
I tried to save Aurora.

132
00:07:27,488 --> 00:07:29,615
And then, my leg was fractured.

133
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:34,120
I'm the man, but I can't even stand up.

134
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,624
Dad…

135
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,419
There's nothing we can do.

136
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,963
What's important is that we are safe.

137
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:46,591
That's right, sir.

138
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,177
Let's just look towards the future, sir.

139
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:53,181
You getting better and the arrival
of your grandchild.

140
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,063
Excuse me. Sir, Ma'am,
have you seen Ma'am Aurora?

141
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,273
Why?

142
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:03,941
We can't find her.

143
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,359
What happened to her?

144
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:13,534
Paco, my son.

145
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,411
Where are you?

146
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,122
Mother needs you. Paco, where are you?

147
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:19,248
Don't!

148
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,667
- Ma'am Aurora, don't.
- Paco.

149
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,837
- Aurora.
- Where are you, my son?

150
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,051
Give me back my son. Show him to me.

151
00:08:31,594 --> 00:08:34,013
- Mom. Mom.
- Bring him back to me, please?

152
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:38,017
Come back to me, son. Please.

153
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:39,727
Mom, please don't.

154
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:42,104
Don't please. Go down, Mom.

155
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,816
Where are you, Paco?

156
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,693
Where are you, Paco? Please.

157
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,487
Mom, come down.

158
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,863
What's with you?

159
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,243
Mom, don't.

160
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:57,245
Mom, please don't. Don't.

161
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,497
Oh, my God.

162
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,499
Sam, where are you going?

163
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:02,792
I will help her.

164
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,961
Really, Sam, you will help her?

165
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:07,004
What if something bad happens to her?

166
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,257
My conscience can't take that.

167
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,633
I need to help her.

168
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:15,513
My son, Paco. Where are you?

169
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,848
Give me back my son. Show me my son.

170
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:19,517
Ma'am Aurora, you might fall.

171
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,643
Don't.

172
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:24,564
- Ma'am.
- Aurora, get down from there. Let's talk.

173
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,357
Get down from there.

174
00:09:26,857 --> 00:09:28,985
No, Galvan.

175
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,319
I don't want to talk to you.

176
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:33,990
Give me back my son. Give Paco back to me.

177
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,409
- You might fall.
- I don't want to talk to you.

178
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,078
- Let's talk.
- My son is all I need.

179
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,455
Please, Paco. Show yourself to me, please.

180
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:44,250
Please show yourself to me.

181
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:58,472
Mom…

182
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:06,022
Mom, please. Please come down. Let's go.

183
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:08,357
No.

184
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,610
I don't want you.

185
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,487
I don't want you. Stay away from me.

186
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:17,867
Where is my son?

187
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,161
Mom…

188
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,747
Paco is dead.

189
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,915
You're a liar.

190
00:10:24,999 --> 00:10:27,710
No, my son is alive.

191
00:10:28,878 --> 00:10:30,379
Mom…

192
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,550
Mom, Paco is gone.

193
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:41,599
His body was burned along with your house.

194
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:45,561
Who burned it down?

195
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:49,857
The report from
the fire department came out.

196
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:54,612
Arson is the cause
of the fire at the Palacios estate.

197
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:55,738
It wasn't an accident.

198
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:59,408
They also saw remnants of TNT

199
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,495
in Aurora Palacios' house.

200
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:05,039
Francis and I saw that too.

201
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:08,542
I know that's what they're
using in the mines.

202
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,504
Exactly. It should be delivered
straight to the mines,

203
00:11:11,587 --> 00:11:14,340
and not inside the residential area.
That's dangerous.

204
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:18,052
They also saw a burned liquid gas case

205
00:11:18,135 --> 00:11:20,679
near where they saw Paco Palacios's body.

206
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:24,892
Most likely,

207
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,436
the fire started near Paco's body.

208
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,605
Yes, but the question is, why?

209
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,692
Was it just a coincidence,
or was Paco's body intentionally burned?

210
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,919
Please, please…

211
00:11:52,711 --> 00:11:55,506
We still don't know who burned it.

212
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:58,050
Sergeant Royales is still trying
to find that out.

213
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,136
No.

214
00:12:00,219 --> 00:12:01,929
You're a liar.

215
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:04,557
You know who burned it.

216
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,059
It was you.

217
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,980
Mom, it wasn't me. You're wrong. No.

218
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,314
It was you who burned my house.

219
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:14,191
- It was you who burned my house.
- Mom, no.

220
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:19,196
You weren't able to kill Paco
when you pushed him from the cliff.

221
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:24,743
That's why you burned down my house
to ensure your husband's death.

222
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:26,996
It was you who killed my son.

223
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,330
- You killed him.
- Mom, it wasn't me.

224
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,749
You're a murderer.

225
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:43,971
It's possible that he was just planning

226
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,806
to burn Paco's body,
but the house got burned too.

227
00:12:47,224 --> 00:12:49,435
He didn't respect Paco's body.

228
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,062
Auntie Aurora had
already made him taxidermy,

229
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,314
and then he got burned.

230
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,107
I have another theory.

231
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:58,903
The mansion was burned down
to eliminate all the evidence

232
00:12:58,986 --> 00:13:01,655
from Basil, Beverly, and Peter's deaths.

233
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,200
Did the serial killer burn it?

234
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:05,951
Yes, who else?

235
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,454
I have a strong hunch
that the investigation

236
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:11,248
of the serial killer is
connected to the fire incident.

237
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:17,379
You're a killer, Sam. You're a killer.

238
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:21,133
You already killed my son,
and you even burned down my house.

239
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,302
I didn't burn down your house.

240
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:29,850
Sam.

241
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,354
Why are you doing this to me?

242
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:36,232
What have I done to you?

243
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:40,027
You always separate my son from me.

244
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:45,908
You're keeping my son away from me.

245
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:50,162
Why are you separating us?

246
00:13:51,705 --> 00:13:53,916
Madam… Ma'am Aurora…

247
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,544
Ma'am Aurora, that's enough.

248
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:57,628
You should rest.

249
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,256
Let me go, Amando.

250
00:14:00,339 --> 00:14:02,508
I need to find my son.

251
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,844
Please, let me go. Let me go. Let me go.

252
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:07,846
I need my son.

253
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,431
Oh, my God.

254
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,892
I need him, Amando, please.

255
00:14:11,976 --> 00:14:14,270
Please, please.

256
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:24,530
Cairo… Call Dr. Bermudez.

257
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,127
The Palacios killer is getting paranoid.

258
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,713
The truth is slowly coming out.

259
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,717
He knows that it won't take long
until we find out who he is.

260
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,012
He thinks I will stop, but he is mistaken.

261
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:49,889
I will not stop going after him.

262
00:14:51,348 --> 00:14:54,476
He needs to pay
for all the Palacioses he has killed.

263
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,769
They deserve justice.

264
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:57,813
How can we find him?

265
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,816
The estate is burned down.
Where will you find pieces of evidence?

266
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:04,028
There's no such thing as perfect crime.

267
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:06,113
Yes, he burned down the mansion,

268
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,198
but he will eventually make a wrong move.

269
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,867
If not right now, maybe next time.

270
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,912
There shouldn't be a next time.

271
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,498
This should be the last time
the Palacios killer outsmarts us.

272
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:18,959
No one should die in my family.

273
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:21,670
Sergeant Royales…

274
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:24,548
You should solve this case.

275
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,344
You should catch whoever
is killing the Palacioses.

276
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,224
Amando, please let me go.

277
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,143
I am your boss. You should follow me.

278
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,062
- Mom, that's enough. Please.
- Let me go.

279
00:15:38,145 --> 00:15:39,480
- Rico, hurry up.
- What's with you?

280
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,148
Rico.

281
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,109
I'm begging you, Amando. Please.

282
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:47,821
- I'm sorry, madam.
- That's enough.

283
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:50,366
I will calm down,
just bring my son to me. Please.

284
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:51,283
Rico.

285
00:15:51,367 --> 00:15:53,702
- Mom, Paco is already gone.
- Let me go.

286
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,288
- Mom, please. Rico.
- Let me go.

287
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,414
Madam….

288
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,415
Here is Ma'am Rebecca's medicine.

289
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:00,125
Let me go.

290
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:15,015
The fire at the estate
was done intentionally?

291
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,601
Do you have an idea who did it?

292
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,561
Unfortunately, not yet.

293
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,022
Me, I have a suspicion

294
00:16:22,106 --> 00:16:25,693
about who started the fire.

295
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,445
- Who?
- It was Sam.

296
00:16:29,738 --> 00:16:33,325
She started the fire
in Ma'am Aurora's house.

297
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,413
Mom, you don't have evidence.

298
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,039
I don't need evidence.

299
00:16:39,707 --> 00:16:44,253
Sam may have inherited
Mercy's arsonous nature.

300
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,171
Remember, their house got
burned down before.

301
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,881
That's why they lived with us.

302
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:50,926
That is why I have a strong
suspicion that it was Sam--

303
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,594
No, no, no…

304
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,848
It was Mercy who burned down
Ma'am Aurora's house.

305
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,975
What are you saying?

306
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,518
I heard my name.

307
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,863
Rico, throw this out.

308
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,202
Sam…

309
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,288
Please help me, Sam.

310
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:23,417
Sam, help me. Please, help me, Sam.

311
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,252
- Mom…
- Help me.

312
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,297
Mom, you need this. You need to calm down.

313
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,507
This is for you. You might…

314
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,676
You might hurt yourself.

315
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,054
This is for your own good.

316
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,599
- Sam…
- Thank you again, Sam.

317
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:43,228
You don't have to thank me.

318
00:17:44,938 --> 00:17:46,398
She is still my family.

319
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,569
She's the grandmother of my baby.

320
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,490
I will just call the doctor.
I will be back.

321
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,870
Sam…

322
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:05,209
Sam…

323
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:09,213
Am I a bad person?

324
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:16,428
Don't think anymore.

325
00:18:17,179 --> 00:18:19,264
Just calm down. Take a rest.

326
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:26,188
I lost all of them.

327
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,817
Paco,

328
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,362
Rebecca,

329
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,865
and Orly.

330
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:45,916
My father?

331
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:53,757
Yes, Mercy.

332
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,176
I was just telling Sergeant that

333
00:18:56,260 --> 00:19:01,140
your house was burned down
after Orly died, right?

334
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:03,142
Why?

335
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:04,893
That was an accident.

336
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,187
Was it an accident,
or did you do that on purpose

337
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:11,316
so you could move to our place,
and be close to my husband?

338
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:16,405
Why would I want to be close
to your animalistic husband?

339
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:18,949
You can have your husband.
You can be together in hell.

340
00:19:19,032 --> 00:19:19,908
Wait a second.

341
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,869
We are deviating from the investigation.

342
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:26,165
I am here because I want
to know if you have an idea

343
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:28,208
of who burned down the estate,

344
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,669
and not your issues.

345
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,129
Ask Sam.

346
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:38,177
They were in a hurry to leave
when the estate got burned down.

347
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,928
Maybe they were escaping from something.

348
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,931
We were escaping from Ma'am Aurora
because of what she did to Sam.

349
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,016
That's right.

350
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:47,728
Didn't Ma'am Aurora kidnap Sam,

351
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:50,647
and lock her up with her husband's corpse?

352
00:19:50,731 --> 00:19:54,234
Maybe Sam cremated Paco
because she was angry,

353
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:56,069
but involved the entire estate.

354
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:57,571
Look, Sarge,

355
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:59,198
all they do is slander.

356
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,575
They should be sued.

357
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:04,203
They keep accusing without basis.

358
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:05,829
You will sue me?

359
00:20:05,913 --> 00:20:07,831
Maybe your sister.

360
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:11,293
Remember she tried to kill me?
She tried to run me over.

361
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:14,213
You know, Serge, since you're here,

362
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,465
why don't you arrest Sam
for frustrated murder?

363
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,217
Stop it, all of you.

364
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:21,428
You are full of suspicions.
All you do is accuse each other.

365
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,096
If you have strong evidence,

366
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,348
come to me.

367
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,808
Stop wasting my time.

368
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,282
My father?

369
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:44,201
Orly Castillo?

370
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,163
Mom, is that what you said?

371
00:20:49,790 --> 00:20:51,333
Mom, wake up.

372
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,335
Did you just say Orly Castillo?

373
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,339
What's your connection
with my father, Mom?

374
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,133
Mom. Wake up, Mom.

375
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,927
Sam…

376
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:18,944
What?

377
00:21:19,027 --> 00:21:21,530
Do you think I've forgotten
about Sam's sins?

378
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:23,657
Never.

379
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:26,368
And I will make sure
that she rots in jail.

380
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,162
It's not Sam who you thought
tried to run you over.

381
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:31,039
Why? Do you have evidence that it was her?

382
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:35,085
Why? Didn't she admit that…

383
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:36,837
she was supposed to kill me?

384
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,340
Yes, because of your husband's orders.
That's because Basil was a demon.

385
00:21:41,216 --> 00:21:42,467
Don't ruin my husband's reputation.

386
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:44,761
- Don't hurt my son.
- Mother…

387
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:46,388
You're lucky because you're a woman.

388
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:48,765
He will not fight with you.
But, I will fight you.

389
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,271
- What now?
- Mother. Mrs. Ruth.

390
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,736
Mother?

391
00:22:02,904 --> 00:22:04,614
What's happening here? Stop it.

392
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:05,657
What's happening here?

393
00:22:05,741 --> 00:22:07,075
What's happening here?

394
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,536
Ask your mother and brother.

395
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,335
Are you crazy?

396
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:19,171
Did you really just
throw a Rubik's Cube at me?

397
00:22:19,254 --> 00:22:22,049
What if that hit my head?
What if I got hurt?

398
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:24,426
What do you think you are doing
to my family?

399
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,012
They started it.

400
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,139
- No, it wasn't us. It was you.
- Hey! It was you.

401
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:31,808
If you're mad at me, confront me.

402
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,769
Why? What will you do Sam?

403
00:22:34,269 --> 00:22:35,979
Will you also kill us,

404
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,607
just like you did to Paco and Basil?

405
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,025
Yes, George.

406
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,195
Is that what you want to hear?

407
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:44,529
Yes.

408
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:47,866
Since that's what you believe, isn't it?

409
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:49,451
That I am a killer?

410
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:53,622
I pushed Paco by accident.

411
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:56,583
And I did not kill your husband.

412
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,585
But, for my family,

413
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:00,796
I'm willing to kill.

414
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:04,758
That's why I'm warning you, George.

415
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,470
The next time you hurt my family…

416
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:11,640
that's not all you'll get.

417
00:23:25,278 --> 00:23:27,864
Okay, Doc. We will wait for you here.

418
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:35,247
Bring some nurses with you.

419
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,873
Knowing Aurora,

420
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,875
she will not easily agree

421
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:41,586
to be taken to a mental facility.

422
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,798
Thank you.

423
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:02,816
Is this a good time?

424
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:15,036
My child… How did you know
where to find us?

425
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:20,667
Cairo told us what happened to the estate,

426
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,836
and what happened to you.

427
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:25,714
I hope you don't mind me visiting you.

428
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,683
I missed you, Sofia.

429
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:39,477
Thank you for coming.

430
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,988
I'm so sorry
about what happened last time.

431
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,948
Forget it.

432
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,409
I'm happy that you're here.

433
00:24:55,076 --> 00:24:56,828
We were so concerned.

434
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:58,788
We?

435
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,383
Hi, Galvan.

436
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,935
We've been here for too long.

437
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,269
Let's go home.

438
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:25,440
I won't leave this place.

439
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,776
I won't leave Ma'am Aurora.

440
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,614
Sam, we've talked about this already.

441
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,450
We'll stay away from
the Palacioses and the Balayses.

442
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,118
Mother, I've changed my mind.

443
00:25:39,329 --> 00:25:41,539
I will not leave Mom Aurora.

444
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:44,000
We are staying.

445
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,710
Why?

446
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,175
Get out.

447
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,469
I don't want you here.

448
00:25:54,552 --> 00:25:56,054
Sofia can stay.

449
00:25:56,721 --> 00:25:59,557
But, you. You're trouble.

450
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:03,520
Dad, don't be rude to Mommy.
She's just worried about you.

451
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:17,575
Galvan…

452
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,330
Listen to me, even for a short while.

453
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,125
I know I was wrong.

454
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,711
I know I did…

455
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,754
a lot of things
that I shouldn't have done.

456
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:32,007
I was hard-headed.

457
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:36,386
Loud, a gossipmonger, quarrelsome,

458
00:26:36,469 --> 00:26:37,887
everything.

459
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:43,184
But, remember. I told you
that I would change?

460
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,229
And that's true, Galvan.

461
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:49,107
That's true. I've changed now.

462
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:56,740
See, Dad? Mommy loves you so much.

463
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:01,828
Galvan, if…

464
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,207
if you don't want to accept me,

465
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,836
if you really don't want to marry me,

466
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:14,299
then go ahead. I will agree.

467
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:17,886
I will agree to this kind of setup.

468
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:23,558
But, let me be of service to you.
I will take care of you,

469
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,144
now that you are weak.

470
00:27:27,729 --> 00:27:32,108
Let me be your guide and support.

471
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:47,957
But if…

472
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:52,670
if you really don't want to accept me…

473
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:55,965
If you're really mad at me,

474
00:27:56,049 --> 00:28:00,303
I'll just go back to Baguio.
I will leave again.

475
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,555
But, Sofia,

476
00:28:02,639 --> 00:28:05,558
you stay here, okay?

477
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:09,938
Take good care of your daddy.

478
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,358
Don't forsake him because

479
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,736
I love your daddy so much.

480
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:21,533
I love you very much, Galvan.

481
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,162
Dad…

482
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,581
I know you have a soft heart.

483
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,292
Please, just give Mommy a chance.

484
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:36,381
Let's be a family again.

485
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,258
Please, Dad.

486
00:28:42,971 --> 00:28:44,139
Fine.

487
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:49,519
As long as she promises not to fight,

488
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,231
or cause any trouble.

489
00:28:56,693 --> 00:28:58,027
I promise, Galvan.

490
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,739
Thank you.

491
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:07,120
Thank you.

492
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:14,919
Sam is really brave, George.

493
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,173
She's already standing up
to being a killer.

494
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,760
I don't know

495
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:24,596
why they are still living
with Auntie Aurora.

496
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,600
If I were Auntie Aurora

497
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,519
and you pushed my son,
I would not only kick you out,

498
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,313
I would have you jailed.

499
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:38,234
But, Ma'am Aurora is
not in her right mind.

500
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,279
That's why Sam is acting like a queen.

501
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,908
Yes, Mom. She's going to be a queen…

502
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,452
in the city jail.

503
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,915
- How?
- Iñigo and I will see each other today.

504
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:55,168
We will discuss what charges
I can file against Sam

505
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,171
for threatening to run me over.

506
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:04,469
Sam…

507
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:07,722
It's not your obligation
to take care of Ma'am Aurora.

508
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,392
I understand you. I know you pity her,

509
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:13,561
but think about yourself.

510
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,190
I will not leave this place…

511
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:21,319
because there's something I want
to find out from Mom Aurora.

512
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,071
What's that, Sam?

513
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:26,658
Her connection to Dad.

514
00:30:28,868 --> 00:30:29,786
To Orly?

515
00:30:37,877 --> 00:30:39,003
Yes, Iñigo.

516
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:41,297
Yes.

517
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:43,299
Okay, fine.

518
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,052
Let's meet at the café.

519
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:48,137
See you.

520
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:54,561
What's that?

521
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:02,569
Mom, is that you?

522
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,242
Mom?

523
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:26,175
When she was sedated, she was crying.

524
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:30,513
She said she was sad
because she lost everything.

525
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:32,807
Paco, Rebecca…

526
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,934
and father.

527
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,855
Hold on. How is Dad involved?

528
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,940
That's what I'm wondering.

529
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,234
That means Dad was also close to her,

530
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,320
just like Paco and Rebecca.

531
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:47,155
It means my suspicion is right.

532
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,450
He was not just an employee in the mines.

533
00:31:50,533 --> 00:31:53,578
It means he had a relationship
with the Palacioses.

534
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,954
What is it, Sam?

535
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,475
Oh, my, George. What happened to you?

536
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:17,810
Are you hurt?

537
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:20,021
What happened to you?

538
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:24,233
You're not being careful.
You and your baby should be careful.

539
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:27,570
- Mom, I'm being careful.
- I heard a sound.

540
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:38,748
That's what I need to find out.

541
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,669
Mom Aurora and I never talked about it

542
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,879
because I didn't know
that they were both close.

543
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:47,298
But, now I know that there's more to it.

544
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,050
And I know…

545
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:51,219
I know she's hiding something.

546
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,765
- That's what I must find out.
- There's nothing for you to find out, Sam.

547
00:32:55,848 --> 00:32:57,308
Your father is gone.

548
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,520
What's important is that both of you…

549
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,313
are alive.

550
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:03,856
I don't want something
bad to happen to you.

551
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,275
So, whether you like it or not,

552
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,319
we are leaving this place.

553
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,286
George, are you okay?

554
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:18,746
What happened?

555
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,040
Did you fall?

556
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:24,002
No, we were just posing here, Vivian.
What's with you?

557
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:27,171
You saw what happened
and you're still asking.

558
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,090
She fell from the stairs.

559
00:33:35,263 --> 00:33:36,973
George…

560
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,687
Rubik's Cube.

561
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,981
Maybe you stepped on this.

562
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:55,158
<i>- What's happening here?</i>
<i>- Ask your mother and brother.</i>

563
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,667
George, do you solve the Rubik's Cube?

564
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:06,002
No.

565
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,881
Then, who owns that?

566
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,383
Sofia doesn't own one.

567
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,345
And Galvan is not fond of it.
Him, of all people.

568
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,223
Or, maybe that's yours, Ruth. Or Ward's?

569
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,476
We don't play with stuff like that.

570
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,521
There's only one person we know
who owns a Rubik's Cube.

571
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:29,942
Who?

572
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:33,321
Sam.

573
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:35,531
Sam?

574
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:40,912
How did her Rubik's Cube end up here

575
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,539
when she lives at the other house?

576
00:34:44,832 --> 00:34:47,627
What's that? Her Rubik's Cube
suddenly appeared here

577
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,212
by magic?

578
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:51,464
George…

579
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,758
Could it be that Sam left it here?

580
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:02,141
Why would Sam do that?

581
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,602
When she knows that
leaving that Rubik's Cube

582
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:07,730
lying around, especially on the stairs,

583
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,398
is dangerous.

584
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:11,567
Someone could get into an accident,
just like what happened to George.

585
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,027
She got into an accident.

586
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:15,446
Because that's really her plan.

587
00:35:17,782 --> 00:35:19,742
She wanted me to fall on purpose.

588
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,120
She also wanted to involve my baby.

589
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:33,506
Francis, get the car ready.

590
00:35:33,589 --> 00:35:35,842
We were only stalled because of Aurora.

591
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:38,010
But, now, we're leaving

592
00:35:38,094 --> 00:35:39,679
with your sister.

593
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,889
But, Mother. What about what Sam said?

594
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:45,726
Aren't you even curious
about Dad's connection to Ma'am Aurora?

595
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:50,565
My children…

596
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:56,112
your father has been dead for a long time.
Let his soul rest in peace.

597
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,030
But, Mother, what if Mom Aurora
has something to do

598
00:35:58,114 --> 00:36:00,324
with Dad's death?

599
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,538
Your father committed suicide.

600
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:16,382
George…

601
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,385
Maybe Sam is not that bad.

602
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,847
Hey. Can you hear what you are saying?

603
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,849
Are you saying that Sam is not bad

604
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,976
when she pushed her husband off the cliff?

605
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:29,854
She doesn't respect anyone,

606
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,940
even my unborn baby.

607
00:36:33,024 --> 00:36:34,692
She wants to put him in danger.

608
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,028
Well, you have a point.

609
00:36:38,821 --> 00:36:41,407
So, what do you plan to do?

610
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,326
Will you confront Sam?

611
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,786
I will not only confront her,

612
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,413
I will teach her a lesson.

613
00:36:48,956 --> 00:36:51,959
Before, I just let things slide,
but now I won't.

614
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,630
My baby was almost in danger here.

615
00:37:18,986 --> 00:37:22,323
I never believed in the result
of the police's investigation

616
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,367
because I know Dad.

617
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,870
How about you, Mother?
Aren't you interested in finding out

618
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:29,705
what happened to him?

619
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,417
I'm interested, but I am scared.

620
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:37,004
We can find out
even if we're not living here.

621
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,090
We can ask Sergeant Royales for help.

622
00:37:39,173 --> 00:37:42,426
Let's tell him to find out the truth.

623
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,554
Mother, it's easier for me
to find out the truth

624
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,057
if I talk to Mom Aurora.

625
00:37:50,601 --> 00:37:51,769
If you want,

626
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,438
you can leave.

627
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:58,109
- I can stay here by myself.
- No. No, Sam.

628
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:00,319
We're not leaving without you.

629
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,571
I won't leave you here alone.

630
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,535
And we're not leaving until we find out
what really happened to Dad.

631
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:15,126
This way. This is Aurora's room.

632
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,463
Where is Aurora?

633
00:38:20,881 --> 00:38:22,216
She is in her room, sir.

634
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,469
- Let's go.
- Wait.

635
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:27,680
Who are these people?

636
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,390
Let us through.

637
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,267
This is Dr. Bermudez.

638
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,270
She is the best psychiatrist
money can get.

639
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:36,731
She will take care of Aurora.

640
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,108
You are sending Ma'am Aurora
to the mental facility?

641
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:43,904
Mother, I'm sorry.
But, I also want to know the truth.

642
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,157
I want to know why he committed suicide.

643
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,951
Suicide or was he killed?

644
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,039
Mother, before Paco died,

645
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:55,499
we were fighting about Dad

646
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,335
because I heard…

647
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:01,005
I heard Mom Aurora and Uncle Galvan
talking about him.

648
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:04,717
What if their entire family is involved

649
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,886
in Dad's death?

650
00:39:06,969 --> 00:39:09,221
Don't you want to get him justice?

651
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,065
You're sending Ma'am Aurora
to the mental facility?

652
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:20,900
I have no choice, Amando.

653
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:23,444
Aurora needs help.

654
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,115
She needs to be treated.
Because if not, it will be dangerous.

655
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:31,786
She will hurt us, and worst, herself.

656
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:35,331
Is this really how this family is?

657
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,293
If you no longer want the person around,
you send them to the mental facility.

658
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:40,795
Just like you did to Rebecca.

659
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,506
I'm doing this for their own good.

660
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,550
They need serious medical help.

661
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:49,804
Just say you don't care about your family.

662
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:52,056
You easily give up.

663
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,434
Instead of being
with Auntie Aurora so she can get better,

664
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,353
what do you do?
You lock her up in a mental facility?

665
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,355
Don't you ever question
my love for my family.

666
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,149
You are new in this family.

667
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,365
Ma'am. Ma'am.

668
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:11,242
There's a commotion downstairs.

669
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:12,451
It's Sir Galvan.

670
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,079
He is planning to send Ma'am Aurora
to a mental facility.

671
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:17,373
What?

672
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:21,210
Aurora needs help.

673
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,088
Don't meddle, Sam.

674
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:25,631
Sam, we'll have a hard time

675
00:40:25,714 --> 00:40:27,591
if they take Ma'am Aurora to the hospital.

676
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:31,804
She shouldn't leave this place.

677
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:33,973
Sam…

678
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,975
- Sam…
- Sam.

679
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,769
So, what if I'm new?

680
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:42,356
It's the same blood flowing in our bodies.

681
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,109
It's surprising.

682
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:48,362
It's you who has spent
the longest time with Auntie Aurora,

683
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:50,322
but you're the one
who easily gives up on her.

684
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,992
Do you think this is easy for me?

685
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:57,246
It also hurts me
that my sister is having a meltdown,

686
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,415
but there's nothing I can do.

687
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,250
I'm doing this for her.

688
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,462
For her, sir, or for you?

689
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,674
Or, maybe you're eager
to lock her up in the mental facility

690
00:41:08,757 --> 00:41:11,051
so you can get her position
in the company?

691
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,054
How dare you make insinuations like that?

692
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:17,057
Be thankful that I'm in a wheelchair

693
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,642
because if I weren't,
I would have punched you.

694
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,146
Let's go.

695
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:23,856
Stay there.

696
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,650
You have to pass through me

697
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:28,402
before you can get to Ma'am Aurora.

698
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,904
Don't listen to him.

699
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,614
I'm the head of this family.

700
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,908
Do as I say. Get Aurora now.

701
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,619
Wait, what's happening here?

702
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:39,705
Do you really have to do this?

703
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:43,250
I'm just giving her the proper care
that she deserves.

704
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,045
Ma'am Sam, please talk to them.

705
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,422
Maybe we can take care of Auntie Aurora.

706
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,757
You?

707
00:41:50,591 --> 00:41:52,510
What do you know?

708
00:41:52,593 --> 00:41:54,470
Aurora has a mental problem.

709
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:58,224
She doesn't need a helper,
she needs a doctor.

710
00:41:58,307 --> 00:42:00,476
What's all this commotion?

711
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,656
Do you also have that?

712
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:14,490
Yes, my father gave me this.

713
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:17,910
It's because my doctor
used to always wear that.

714
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:18,786
It's Dr. Orly.

715
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:21,372
Mom, Basil is not gay, is he?

716
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:24,833
George, is there a gay who wants a man,

717
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,253
