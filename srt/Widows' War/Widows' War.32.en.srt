1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,844
Mom, I received a death threat.

2
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:55,305
Mom, if you're not scared for my life,

3
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,474
then be scared for my baby

4
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,894
because your grandchild

5
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:02,062
will be gone.

6
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,355
I will agree for you to leave for a while

7
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:05,440
<i>but on one condition.</i>

8
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:08,318
<i>You will stay in one</i>
<i>of my houses in Manila.</i>

9
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,237
What if she takes my baby away?

10
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:12,864
Sam may be far,

11
00:01:12,947 --> 00:01:16,159
I can see every move she makes.

12
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,245
<i>Who? Who was that?</i>
<i>Where is the voice coming from?</i>

13
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,915
How long will I hide here?

14
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:24,334
You'll be free before your baby comes.

15
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,377
I promise you that, Son.

16
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,629
‪PREVIOUSLY

17
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:31,216
Don't think about what Sir Galvan said.

18
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:34,344
<i>Even if he didn't finish what he said,</i>
<i>I know.</i>

19
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,679
Barren, that's how he sees me.

20
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,348
<i>Ma'am, let's drink your medicine.</i>

21
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,183
Give me one good reason

22
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,560
for me to continue my medicines
to get well.

23
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,396
So you and your brother
can be together for a long time.

24
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,773
- Jericho…
- It's a good thing

25
00:01:46,856 --> 00:01:48,608
that Detective Royales is good.

26
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,235
And he will help us.

27
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:51,277
With what?

28
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:53,446
With finding the real killer.

29
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:59,327
I will not allow the killer
to hurt the next CEO of Palacios Mining.

30
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:00,245
CEO?

31
00:02:00,328 --> 00:02:05,041
This time, the next leader of this family
will come from my line.

32
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,709
<i>Galvan. Galvan.</i>

33
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,086
<i>There's something you need to know.</i>

34
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,089
<i>Aurora is hiding something.</i>
<i>I'm sure of what I heard.</i>

35
00:02:11,172 --> 00:02:14,717
<i>There are voices in Aurora's office.</i>

36
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,887
You are not supposed
to go to Aurora's house.

37
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,348
What if it's your sister

38
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:24,435
who is hiding the serial killer
on the Palacios estate?

39
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,563
So, the bastard is back.

40
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:27,981
I have a right to this house.

41
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:30,066
We may share the same blood, Jericho,

42
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:34,404
but I will never ever consider you
as family.

43
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,573
From now on, everything

44
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,992
that I think is right
for myself, I will do it.

45
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:42,537
<i>And I will start that</i>
<i>by protecting my brother.</i>

46
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,129
Are they the guards you recommended?

47
00:02:51,671 --> 00:02:55,675
Yes, sir. They came from the agency
guarding the Royales family.

48
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:58,761
You can trust and depend on them.

49
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:02,599
What about the CCTV cameras?

50
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:06,686
We will install new CCTV cameras
around the estate.

51
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,355
Only a few of us know about this.

52
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,567
It seems the serial killer
knows the old cameras.

53
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:14,652
That's why he can easily avoid them.

54
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:39,636
- You're so serious about that.
- Hey. Give that back.

55
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,804
I promised Dad that I'll study that.

56
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,640
Give it back. Come on.

57
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,934
Give me that. Hey. Hey.

58
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:48,478
Sir, my advice

59
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,813
is not to trust anyone,

60
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,274
even your relatives.

61
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,984
At this point,

62
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,737
anyone can be a suspect or suspects.

63
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,530
You mean…

64
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,200
there's more than one killer?

65
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:03,534
Probably.

66
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,038
Or, he has an accomplice.
That's how he can pull off the killings.

67
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:13,002
Give me that.

68
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,629
Give me that.

69
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:16,047
Excuse me.

70
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,348
Hey, come on.

71
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,810
Here.

72
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,649
Let's hang out.

73
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,154
It's so boring.

74
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,157
The people are so strict now.

75
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,451
It seems…

76
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,329
we're not allowed to go out.
We're not allowed to invite friends over.

77
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:50,707
- Right?
- Duh.

78
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,668
There's a serial killer on the loose.

79
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,962
Of course, the security is tight.

80
00:04:57,630 --> 00:05:00,591
Aren't you scared
the killer might hurt you?

81
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:04,012
I'm scared, but our life shouldn't stop

82
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,972
just because of that.

83
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,808
That's why…

84
00:05:09,434 --> 00:05:10,310
Let's go.

85
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,353
Let's go out.

86
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,981
You can read that later. Let's escape.

87
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:18,192
What do you think you're doing?

88
00:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,529
You want to sneak my daughter out
of this house?

89
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:03,279
Didn't you hear the news from your sister?

90
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:06,657
There's a serial killer
that's targeting the Palacioses.

91
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,951
And you want to take out my daughter?

92
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:14,457
Just for fun, sir,

93
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,334
because it's boring.

94
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,088
Sofia and l will be back right away.

95
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,634
Why are you inviting Sofia?

96
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,220
Because…

97
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:30,264
we're friends.

98
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,354
If you want company,
you can easily ask George or even Ruth.

99
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:38,147
But, why my daughter?

100
00:06:39,398 --> 00:06:42,610
Or, maybe you're planning
to do something bad to her.

101
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:46,155
That's why you want
to lure her out of the estate.

102
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,491
So the killer can easily get her.

103
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,577
Uncle, no.

104
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,748
- Tell me. Tell me.
- Don't.

105
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:57,166
Are you the killer's accomplice?

106
00:07:17,019 --> 00:07:18,729
I wonder what's behind…

107
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,898
that bookshelf?

108
00:07:30,032 --> 00:07:34,120
Could the serial killer be hiding there?

109
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:39,584
Only one way to find out.

110
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:22,919
It won't move.

111
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,678
Why won't it move?

112
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,723
Admit it.

113
00:08:35,806 --> 00:08:37,266
Is Sofia the next target?

114
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,143
That's why you're inviting her to go out?

115
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:41,312
No. No, I don't know the killer.

116
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:44,440
Dad, Ward means no harm.

117
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,399
He's just being playful.

118
00:08:45,483 --> 00:08:47,151
He's a great friend.

119
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,320
You cannot trust anyone.

120
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,948
A friend can easily betray you.

121
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,032
Stay still.

122
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:55,576
Uncle, I'm innocent.

123
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,411
Uncle, I'm not doing anything bad.

124
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,080
- This. Give me this.
- Hey.

125
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:01,374
Sir Galvan, that's enough.

126
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:04,168
Dad, why are you harassing my brother?

127
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:07,964
Brother? Or an accomplice of the killer?

128
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,359
There.

129
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,577
There it is. Oh.

130
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:39,829
Aurora…

131
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,417
As far as I know,

132
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:48,129
Sam is the interior designer.

133
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:54,010
So, why the hell are you
rearranging my shelves, Vivian?

134
00:10:03,144 --> 00:10:04,604
Aurora, you're there.

135
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,606
But, of course.

136
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,650
This is my house, my property.

137
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,236
I should be the one asking you.

138
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,363
Why are you here?

139
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:17,700
Why are you trespassing?
Are you stealing from me, Vivian?

140
00:10:17,783 --> 00:10:20,161
No, of course not. I'm not stealing.

141
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:22,079
Amando. Amando.

142
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,748
There's a thief in my house.

143
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:25,583
- I didn't steal anything.
- What did you take?

144
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:26,626
- What did you take?
- Nothing. Nothing.

145
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:27,543
My gold watch?

146
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,295
- What? My gold pen?
- No, I didn't steal anything.

147
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:31,839
I didn't steal anything from you.

148
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:36,510
Then what in God's name
are you doing in my house?

149
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:41,641
I heard something here…

150
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:44,185
I heard voices here.

151
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,855
Maybe the serial killer is here.

152
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:55,571
Ward, did you do something?

153
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:59,200
No, Mom. Uncle suddenly accused me
of a lot of things.

154
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,411
Sir Galvan…

155
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,623
it's impossible that Ward is
the killer's accomplice.

156
00:11:05,706 --> 00:11:09,085
Up to now,
my son is still scared of thunder.

157
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,086
Dad…

158
00:11:11,253 --> 00:11:14,090
my brother is just annoying and playful.

159
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,801
Ward is not capable of
what you're accusing him of.

160
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,260
- Trust me.
- Yes.

161
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,428
Trust you?

162
00:11:20,429 --> 00:11:24,809
Now, the Palacios family
is being killed one by one.

163
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,770
Trust is a luxury I cannot afford it.

164
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:30,606
Dad, wait.

165
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,569
What's your proof
that my brother is doing something bad?

166
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,696
What do you think I'm doing?

167
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,782
I'm looking for evidence.

168
00:11:41,575 --> 00:11:43,077
Uncle, not my cellphone.

169
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,412
- That's my privacy.
- No, wait.

170
00:11:44,495 --> 00:11:46,080
- Hold on.
- That's my privacy.

171
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,206
What are you hiding here?

172
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:50,209
Your conversation with the killer?

173
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,546
Why? How much did he promise you?

174
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,215
One? Two million pesos?

175
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:58,843
Dad, that's enough.

176
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:02,304
Have pity on my brother.

177
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:05,766
You suddenly suspect him

178
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,227
when you don't have strong evidence.

179
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:10,146
George, George…

180
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,439
No, Mother.

181
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,732
Dad needs to know this.

182
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:16,652
Even if we were poor.

183
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,321
Even if he thinks
we don't have dreams and ambitions,

184
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,407
we don't kill people.

185
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,871
And we would never accept payment
to help the killer

186
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,124
to kill the family
that we consider family.

187
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,722
A serial killer?

188
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:47,850
Where? Here?

189
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,644
Inside my bookshelf?

190
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:51,937
My God, Vivian.

191
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:54,148
I thought you were only cheap.

192
00:12:54,231 --> 00:12:57,067
I didn't know that you're delusional too.

193
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,362
But, I heard it.

194
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,616
I heard voices here.

195
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:07,286
- Here on the bookshelves.
- My gosh, Vivian.

196
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,830
You can hear voices too?

197
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,416
Have you seen a doctor?

198
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,170
Maybe you want me
to recommend Rebecca's psychiatrist.

199
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,796
You know, she's good.

200
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,840
She can help you with your craziness.

201
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:22,384
I am not crazy.

202
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,845
I know there's someone behind this.

203
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:28,265
And I will find out who is it.

204
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,481
Don't you dare touch that, Vivian.

205
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:42,238
Look at you. You know how to answer back.

206
00:13:42,321 --> 00:13:43,489
You know how to fight.

207
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:48,244
As long as it's for my family, I am brave.

208
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,204
I will fight for them,

209
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,541
especially if I know
that we're not doing anything bad.

210
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,921
If you have proof
that Ward is an accomplice, show us.

211
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:03,050
We will answer you in court.

212
00:14:06,053 --> 00:14:08,681
Dad, I think that's enough now.

213
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,853
Watch yourself.

214
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,024
Choose who you answer back.

215
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:24,822
Don't you forget
who owns the roof over your head.

216
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:31,829
The next time you touch my things,

217
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:34,874
I'm going to slap you to hell.

218
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,001
Why does it seem like
you're so scared of me

219
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:40,004
finding out what's in there, Aurora?

220
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:44,258
Maybe you're really hiding
the serial killer there, right?

221
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:48,804
I don't have to hide the killer, Vivian,

222
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:52,349
because I can kill you right now

223
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,268
and I won't go to jail.

224
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,436
Do you know why?

225
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,147
Because what you're doing is trespassing.

226
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:02,860
I can do whatever I want

227
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:06,780
because you're inside my house.

228
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:10,159
Wow…

229
00:15:10,784 --> 00:15:13,245
you're so defensive.

230
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,164
Oh, God.

231
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:17,708
Maybe you're really hiding
something there.

232
00:15:18,584 --> 00:15:20,961
Well, I will find out
what you're hiding here.

233
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:22,212
Come here.

234
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,844
Why did you slap me?

235
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,137
That hurt.

236
00:15:31,972 --> 00:15:35,267
Didn't I warn you already, Vivian?

237
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,774
If you touch any of my things,
I will slap you.

238
00:15:41,857 --> 00:15:43,108
That hurt.

239
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,445
You're slapping me over a bookshelf?

240
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:50,866
To be honest, Vivian,
I was even merciful to you.

241
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,204
You entered my house
without my permission.

242
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:56,997
I've been saying this over
and over to you.

243
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:59,458
What you're doing is trespassing.

244
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,711
I am not trespassing

245
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,674
because technically,
we're living on the same estate.

246
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,550
So, this is my house too.

247
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:14,682
Vivian, I thought you were
only a gold digger.

248
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:19,061
But, now you're a land grabber too.

249
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,355
My brother just got you pregnant

250
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:25,401
and now your face is as wide as our land.

251
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:29,363
You are claiming a house that's not yours.

252
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:32,116
Get out of my house. Now.

253
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,205
- No.
- Come here.

254
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:39,373
I said get out.

255
00:16:39,456 --> 00:16:40,499
- No.
- Come here.

256
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,543
- Ouch. Ouch.
- Come here.

257
00:16:42,626 --> 00:16:43,836
- Ouch.
- Come here.

258
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,171
I will find out what your secret is,

259
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,840
what you are hiding behind there. Ouch.

260
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,466
Ouch.

261
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:54,304
Ward, check it carefully.

262
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,597
Is it complete?

263
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,808
Is everything there? Check it out.

264
00:16:58,517 --> 00:16:59,685
Yes, Mom.

265
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,939
It's okay, Ward. It's okay.

266
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:08,068
George, thank you.

267
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,279
You defended me to Uncle.

268
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:12,197
I thought he would send me to jail.

269
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,743
I won't let that happen.

270
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,578
I will not forsake you, Ward.

271
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:19,621
I am your sister. I'm your ally.

272
00:17:19,705 --> 00:17:22,416
I will fight for you even against Dad.

273
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,085
But, George…

274
00:17:25,169 --> 00:17:28,297
I think you went overboard earlier.

275
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,758
Of course, this is still
Sir Galvan's house.

276
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,885
What if he throws us out of here?

277
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,763
Well, then let's leave.

278
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,475
Maybe it's better if we just move out.

279
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:44,188
George, let's think about it carefully.

280
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:47,649
Let's not make decisions
when we're hot-headed.

281
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,652
Do you prefer to stay here, Mom?

282
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,946
Where there is a serial killer?

283
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,282
Aren't you scared

284
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:56,617
that he might kill us next?

285
00:17:57,451 --> 00:18:01,163
Ward, I'm more scared
to die of poverty and hunger.

286
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,084
Mother, we will not become poor.

287
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:08,796
I will still inherit something from Basil.

288
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:12,883
Yes, but you will only get that

289
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:15,094
once the case is solved.

290
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,970
If they find the serial killer.

291
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,225
And George, our lives
are comfortable here.

292
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,560
We may not be the king or queen,

293
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,522
but we're still living in a palace.

294
00:18:30,901 --> 00:18:32,694
Come here.

295
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,488
Let go of my hair.

296
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,823
Come on. You shameless.

297
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,116
Really?

298
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,702
I will rebond you, Vivian.

299
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,163
To straighten your attitude.

300
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,916
You have the guts to enter my house.

301
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,043
Where are you taking me?

302
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:51,380
I will throw you in the mud
where you belong.

303
00:18:54,883 --> 00:18:56,093
You too.

304
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,681
Why did you let anyone enter my house?

305
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:02,891
Ma'am, Mrs. Palacios is not a stranger.

306
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,686
Stop calling her Mrs. Palacios.

307
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:07,312
She is not related to me.

308
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,690
She's not married to Galvan.

309
00:19:09,773 --> 00:19:11,900
She's not a Palacios.

310
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:17,281
Let me be clear to you, Vivian.

311
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:20,617
Just because Galvan accepted you here,

312
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:23,120
it doesn't mean that I've accepted you.

313
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,246
Why?

314
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,415
Did I tell you to accept me?

315
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:29,793
If you don't want me, I don't want you.

316
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,378
I don't like you more.

317
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,131
Miss Vivian.

318
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:37,050
Don't talk that way to Ma'am Aurora.

319
00:19:37,134 --> 00:19:38,510
Don't meddle here, Amando.

320
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:39,803
You're just a helper.

321
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:45,475
At least Amando has a right to be here.

322
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:48,061
While you, you're a leech

323
00:19:48,145 --> 00:19:52,316
who is forcing yourself on my brother.

324
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,699
You see that bridge over there, Vivian?

325
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,244
That bridge is the border

326
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:09,166
that's dividing my property and Galvan's.

327
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:12,377
Everything over that bridge

328
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,297
is Galvan's, so you belong there.

329
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:21,011
But, everything over here
is mine and mine alone.

330
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:26,266
Don't you ever cross that line again.

331
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,227
Am I clear?

332
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,733
Crystal!

333
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,153
Crystal clear, Aurora.

334
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:43,575
If you ever cross that bridge again,

335
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:47,454
even just a centimeter, Vivian,

336
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,874
you can never come back.

337
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,210
Not even to Galvan's house,

338
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,754
which you claim is your house too.

339
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,549
Amando.

340
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:01,593
Find that serial killer.

341
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:06,556
Tell him I will pay him five million

342
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,476
to kill that woman first.

343
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,272
Guard, take her out.

344
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:14,606
Ma'am, let's go.

345
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,817
You'll have your day with me.

346
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,777
You'll have your day with me.

347
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,737
- Animals.
- Ma'am, let's go.

348
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:22,572
Animals!

349
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:35,794
God.

350
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:57,816
Paco!

351
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,862
My child…

352
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:02,904
Sam…

353
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,157
What's the problem?

354
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,450
What?

355
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,618
Mother…

356
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:13,123
Mother, I dreamt of Paco.

357
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,044
I dreamt of Paco.

358
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:20,380
Do you always think of him?

359
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,804
He's my husband.

360
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,016
He's the love of my life.

361
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:36,188
I still can't avoid feeling the…

362
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:38,398
What?

363
00:22:40,525 --> 00:22:43,653
The guilt that I killed my own husband.

364
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,622
Mom, will you please calm down?

365
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,583
It's just Auntie Vivian.

366
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:59,044
Don't let her get on your nerves.

367
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:02,714
Paco, my son. She almost found you.

368
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:07,803
You know, no one should know
that you're here.

369
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,513
It's too dangerous.

370
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,723
- Our plans will be destroyed, Paco.
- Mom…

371
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:14,392
Do not worry.

372
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:16,228
No one found out.

373
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:19,272
You scared Auntie Vivian already.

374
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,983
I'm sure she will not do it again.

375
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,363
My goodness.

376
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:32,786
Out of the hundreds
that Galvan could have had as a mistress,

377
00:23:32,869 --> 00:23:37,374
I don't know why he chose
a cheap, gossipmonger,

378
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,210
and no breeding like Vivian.

379
00:23:40,293 --> 00:23:42,754
Galvan is just a man.

380
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,132
When it comes to women,

381
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:48,426
they use libido before logic.

382
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,805
Just like you when you married Sam?

383
00:23:58,186 --> 00:24:00,147
Oh, how is the food?

384
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,983
Is it ready? Is it warm already?

385
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:06,319
Is the table set already?

386
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,364
Is it complete? Fix it properly.

387
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:14,161
Make sure it's perfect
because this is a very special day.

388
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:16,788
Vivian.

389
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,666
Did you go to Aurora's house again?

390
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,002
She called me and was fuming.

391
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:24,171
She said you should be thankful
that she didn't kill you.

392
00:24:25,046 --> 00:24:26,673
I knew it.

393
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,675
Your sister is guilty.

394
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,052
She is really hiding something.

395
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:33,889
Galvan, why don't you want us to go there?

396
00:24:33,972 --> 00:24:35,807
Let's find out what it is.

397
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,352
Whatever Aurora is doing in her house,

398
00:24:39,436 --> 00:24:40,937
it's none of your business.

399
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,692
Your only job here
is to take care of our daughter.

400
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:48,528
What if what she's hiding there

401
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:50,864
is the killer?

402
00:24:50,947 --> 00:24:53,283
What if the one killing our family

403
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:55,368
is there in her house?

404
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,876
Sam, you didn't kill Paco.

405
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:05,712
What happened to him was an accident.

406
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,882
But, Mother, I still pushed him.

407
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,425
I pushed him.

408
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,347
You were only protecting yourself.

409
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,683
If you didn't do that
maybe you would be dead by now too.

410
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:23,855
I have a feeling…

411
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:26,566
I have a feeling everything
started with me.

412
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:29,194
If I hadn't pushed Paco,

413
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:31,988
Basil would not have blackmailed me.

414
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:34,658
And then I would not have stolen
Francis' morphine,

415
00:25:34,741 --> 00:25:35,867
and there would be no chaos.

416
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,619
Then Francis would not have gone to jail.

417
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,080
- I'm so bad.
- My child…

418
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,790
Just let Francis be.

419
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,541
He's doing okay now.

420
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,170
He is okay.

421
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,839
You should forgive yourself.

422
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,843
Forgive yourself.

423
00:25:58,098 --> 00:25:59,266
Mother, what if…

424
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:04,104
I tell Francis everything?

425
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:10,443
Sam, I already bought your medicine.

426
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,199
Why are you crying?

427
00:26:35,385 --> 00:26:38,138
Do you also want an apple?

428
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:41,224
Paco, my son…

429
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,935
you still haven't answered my question.

430
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:48,231
Do you love Sam, or…

431
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:51,526
did you marry her to spite me?

432
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:55,572
Sam…

433
00:26:57,741 --> 00:26:59,576
She's very special.

434
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:05,498
She is different
from the women I used to date.

435
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,251
Do you miss her?

436
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:13,840
What difference does it make?

437
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:19,596
We're not allowed to see each other.
She's not allowed to know the truth.

438
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:23,641
I'm sorry, Paco.

439
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,978
We still need to keep this a secret.

440
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:32,317
- Just endure it.
- I understand.

441
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:35,320
I understand.

442
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:38,823
But, I'm not giving up.

443
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:44,579
Someday, Sam and I will see each other.

444
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:49,209
And on that day,

445
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,214
I hope that she's ready…

446
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,592
for what's in store for her.

447
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,909
Number one,

448
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,329
Aurora will never hide a serial killer

449
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:28,331
who's out to kill our family.

450
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,000
Number two, it's not your job

451
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:34,963
to find the Palacios killer
because you're not a Palacios.

452
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,758
Then make me.

453
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,387
Galvan, marry me.

454
00:28:42,887 --> 00:28:45,056
Make me a legit Palacios.

455
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,309
Come.

456
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:49,894
Come.

457
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,566
I've been planning to do this
for a long time now.

458
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:58,403
In fact, I bought this a long time ago

459
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:00,363
so I'd be ready anytime.

460
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,874
Galvan Palacios…

461
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,335
will you marry me?

462
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:23,762
Mother, Sam, what happened?

463
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,221
Did someone bother you?

464
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:27,724
Did the serial killer find us?

465
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:30,477
No.

466
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,771
We're safe here.

467
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,857
Sam, why are you crying?

468
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:42,071
Nothing.

469
00:29:43,031 --> 00:29:44,324
This is nothing.

470
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,911
It's nothing.

471
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,998
We just thought about your dad.

472
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,083
That's why Sam cried.

473
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,214
I have a feeling that…

474
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:01,966
there's something you're not telling me.

475
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:06,805
If we're family,
shouldn't we trust each other?

476
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,432
But, it feels like you don't trust me.

477
00:30:10,016 --> 00:30:11,976
- Francis, no…
- Here's your medicine, Sam. Drink it.

478
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:36,417
Stand up there.

479
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,046
Is it a yes?

480
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:43,508
You will marry me? You'll make me…

481
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,260
Vivian Palacios?

482
00:30:46,052 --> 00:30:47,053
No.

483
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:49,639
Stop your illusion.

484
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,641
I cannot marry you,

485
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,268
and I will not marry you.

486
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:55,854
Why?

487
00:30:57,605 --> 00:30:59,232
What's lacking in me?

488
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,653
I'm doing everything for you.

489
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,822
I'm always by your side.

490
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:08,032
I never left your side.

491
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,784
I even gave you a beautiful daughter.

492
00:31:10,368 --> 00:31:13,663
But, it doesn't mean
that I'm going to marry you.

493
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,666
Don't you love me?

494
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:18,877
Love?

495
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:33,516
Didn't I tell you before
that I am on the visitors list?

496
00:31:35,268 --> 00:31:36,269
There's Mrs. Palacios.

497
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:37,854
You can ask her.

498
00:31:37,937 --> 00:31:38,980
George…

499
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,484
It's okay, he's with me.

500
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,194
He's someone I can trust.

501
00:31:46,946 --> 00:31:47,780
Thank you.

502
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:51,367
Wow.

503
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,619
Goodness.

504
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:54,287
What a security.

505
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,747
There are a lot of requirements.

506
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,374
ID, physical confirmation.

507
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,752
They're worse than the central bank.

508
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,921
I'm sorry about that.

509
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,799
It's red alert 24/7 here on the estate

510
00:32:06,883 --> 00:32:09,510
because they still haven't found
the serial killer.

511
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:10,595
I see.

512
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:13,139
Anyway, you said you want
to consult something with me.

513
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:14,307
What's that?

514
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:18,686
I was just wondering
when my inheritance from Basil

515
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,648
will be transferred.

516
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,150
I'm depending on that.

517
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,027
I could use the money

518
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,739
to maybe move somewhere
or start a business.

519
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,074
George, why?

520
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,617
What happened?

521
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:35,203
Did something happen? Are you scared?

522
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:36,746
Is there a threat from the killer?

523
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:38,498
No.

524
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,253
George, you can tell me everything.

525
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,131
I'm not just a lawyer.

526
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,300
I'm also your friend.

527
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:55,014
Ever since Basil died,

528
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:58,351
I've lost my purpose.

529
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,939
I'm not someone's wife anymore,

530
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,442
I'm just a sad, lonely widow.

531
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,278
Why, what's funny?

532
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,241
You. You're so funny.

533
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:18,413
Actually, you're funny
bordering on being pitiful.

534
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:20,873
You're delusional.

535
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:25,920
Why don't you tell it to me straight?

536
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,297
You don't want to marry me.

537
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,133
Exactly.

538
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:34,053
Years ago, I considered it.

539
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,472
I lost my wife, you were there.

540
00:33:36,556 --> 00:33:38,057
I was lonely.

541
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,352
But now? Not anymore.

542
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,147
Look at you.

543
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,942
After all the money that I gave you,

544
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,485
you still look cheap.

545
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,782
I'll lose weight. I'll have liposuction.

546
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:57,285
I'll have Botox and fillers.

547
00:33:57,368 --> 00:33:59,954
I'll wear high heels and branded clothes.

548
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,080
I'll do anything.

549
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,665
I can do that, Galvan. I can.

550
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:06,878
Money can never buy you class.

551
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:11,007
You're so desperate
for attention, for recognition.

552
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,258
It's so disgusting.

553
00:34:14,177 --> 00:34:17,221
Our maids act more dignified

554
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:18,806
than you.

555
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:32,445
Maybe if I had a baby,
I wouldn't be this lost.

556
00:34:35,281 --> 00:34:37,700
I'd be busy taking care of my baby.

557
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:41,204
But, that didn't happen.

558
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,182
Who's that?

559
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:04,644
It's… It's Attorney Quinto.

560
00:35:04,727 --> 00:35:07,230
Basil and Uncle Galvan's business manager.

561
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:10,691
I'm assuming it's their quarterly review
of their assets.

562
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,820
You know, George…

563
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,030
you should be there.

564
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,573
Me?

565
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:19,158
Why?

566
00:35:20,034 --> 00:35:21,661
George, you're Basil's heir.

567
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:25,915
You have every right to know
what's happening with his portfolio.

568
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,584
And that is your money too.

569
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,671
Dad didn't tell me anything.

570
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,466
You told me…

571
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:38,094
you don't have a purpose anymore.

572
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:39,846
Here it is.

573
00:35:40,638 --> 00:35:42,515
Protect Basil's assets.

574
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,851
You know if I were you…

575
00:35:45,351 --> 00:35:46,644
No, no…

576
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,147
Basil would want you to.

577
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,107
Okay, go upstairs.

578
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:54,861
Go inside the room and join the meeting.

579
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:59,240
And fight for your rights as Basil's wife.

580
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,793
Just be happy.

581
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,130
I gave my name to our daughter.

582
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:19,218
But, I will never dare
give the Palacios name

583
00:36:20,636 --> 00:36:21,888
to someone like you.

584
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:31,981
What are you whispering about?

585
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,733
Get out.

586
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,998
Go ahead, Galvan.

587
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:53,920
Think that I am cheap

588
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:55,838
and desperate.

589
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,053
I didn't waste my whole life…

590
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,974
to be disrespected by the Palacioses.

591
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,481
Cheap, huh?

592
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,902
If you will not give me the Palacios name,

593
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:18,903
well then…

594
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:25,368
I will bring all of you down.

595
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,120
We will all fall…

596
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,624
in the mud together.

597
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:34,335
And you, Galvan…

598
00:37:35,461 --> 00:37:36,879
and you, Aurora…

599
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:42,593
You're so obnoxious.

600
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,264
You're so arrogant.

601
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,308
You think so highly of yourselves.

602
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:54,021
The time will come
when you will crawl on the ground.

603
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:56,148
I will make sure of that.

604
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,447
Animals.

605
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,535
Palacioses are animals.

606
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:12,581
Sarge…

607
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,459
if you think Jericho was framed,

608
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:20,464
who would plant the evidence
in his things?

609
00:38:21,257 --> 00:38:23,342
It should be someone
who has access to his room.

610
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,138
All of them.

611
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:33,311
The Palacioses and workers,
they can go to our room.

612
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,273
- What are you doing here?
- I invited him.

613
00:38:37,356 --> 00:38:40,526
We need someone who has insights
into the dynamics of the Palacioses.

614
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:41,944
He can help us.

615
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:47,908
Attorney, this is my daughter, Sofia.

616
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,118
Hello, Sofia.

617
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,162
Sofia…

618
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,289
this is Attorney Quinto,

619
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,124
my lawyer,

620
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:58,044
and soon to be your private teacher.

621
00:38:58,127 --> 00:38:59,670
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

622
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,257
- Private teacher?
- Yes.

623
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,551
He will teach you business management.

624
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:09,180
How to make financial records,

625
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,265
balance sheets.

626
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,100
Basically, how to run a company.

627
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:16,562
Your daddy has so much trust
in you, Sofia.

628
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:19,315
The security in the mansion is so tight

629
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:20,941
so that you won't get hurt.

630
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,069
Gold is really like that.

631
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,071
You take care of it and guard it.

632
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:30,743
Okay.

633
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:34,455
Who do you think framed you?

634
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,915
I don't know.

635
00:39:36,457 --> 00:39:38,959
I was not on the estate
when they placed it in my things.

636
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:40,961
It was me who saw those things.

637
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,089
I was with Mrs. George Palacios.

638
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,673
George?

639
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:54,850
I was told
that this is where the quarterly review

640
00:39:54,934 --> 00:39:56,769
of Basil's portfolio is.

641
00:39:58,604 --> 00:39:59,939
George, you will only get bored.

642
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:03,234
Attorney Quinto and I can handle this.

643
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:06,946
Just focus on whatever it is that you do…

644
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,906
Shopping.

645
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,411
Dad…

646
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:15,996
I want to be involved.

647
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:17,957
I am still Basil's wife.

648
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:21,544
You don't know anything
about running a company.

649
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,671
I can learn.

650
00:40:24,797 --> 00:40:26,424
I am a fast learner.

651
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,051
I can get an adviser to teach me.

652
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:30,886
Like who?

653
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:35,391
Like Iñigo, Basil's best friend.

654
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:42,982
Of all people….

655
00:40:43,065 --> 00:40:45,609
Of all people, what, Dad?

656
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,740
Basil, I have good news.

657
00:40:51,824 --> 00:40:54,785
Paco is going to the States for his MBA.

658
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:59,415
You'll be the next OIC
of the Palacios Mining.

659
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:03,586
Basil?

660
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,214
What the hell!

661
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,093
Dad…

662
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,937
Didn't I tell you to stay away
from my son?

663
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:22,897
Dad

664
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,648
Go, just go.

665
00:41:25,232 --> 00:41:26,984
Go, just go.

666
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:27,985
Just go.

667
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,740
Damn it, Dad. You could have killed him.

668
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,450
I will really kill him.

669
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:36,368
Don't you dare
let him come near you again.

670
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,496
Dad, you can't stop us.

671
00:41:39,121 --> 00:41:41,040
Don't try me, Basil.

672
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,334
Stay away from him.

673
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,546
You will find a woman
and you'll marry her.

674
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:50,132
You will build a normal family

675
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:51,759
and you will give me a grandchild.

676
00:41:52,635 --> 00:41:54,053
What if I don't?

677
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:55,763
What will you do?

678
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,182
God forgive me…

679
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,769
but I will kill you both.

680
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,026
Never mind.

681
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,070
I will let you in here,

682
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:13,906
but don't consult that Iñigo.

683
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,701
Or better yet, never let him come here.

684
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,996
Why? He is Basil's best friend.

685
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:24,291
I never approved of their friendship.

686
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,002
But why?

687
00:42:27,086 --> 00:42:29,588
I don't have to explain anything to you.

688
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:32,132
Just leave, George.

689
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:35,553
You'll never be a part of this company.

690
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:39,223
Or, if you want to consult
your friend, Iñigo,

691
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:43,310
but.. He can't give you any advice

692
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,730
that can change my mind.

693
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:52,611
Now, be a dear, and leave us at peace,

694
00:42:53,362 --> 00:42:55,948
so we can discuss important matters.

695
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,992
Go.

696
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,249
And, George…

697
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,752
tell the maid to bring us coffee.

698
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:14,133
George, just black coffee
for me, please. No sugar.

699
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:22,182
<i>All of them have done something</i>
<i>wrong to George.</i>

700
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,476
- Peter stole Basil's jewelry.
- How about Beverly?

701
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,270
<i>She's carrying Basil's illegitimate child.</i>

702
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:27,396
<i>What have you done?</i>

703
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,107
Everything you touch gets destroyed.
That photo, my son.

704
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:31,817
How about Basil Palacios?

705
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:34,570
George Palacios may want to be free

706
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:36,238
from her husband
because she loves someone else.

707
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,032
Everything's on me. I was wrong.

708
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:40,451
I put Basil in danger.

709
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,202
She wants to reconcile
with her old boyfriend,

710
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,163
Sergeant Abdul Casas.

711
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:45,497
<i>Aunt Larry.</i>

712
00:43:45,581 --> 00:43:47,041
- You have babies?
- Yes.

713
00:43:47,124 --> 00:43:49,335
<i>A good friend of mine</i>
<i>persuaded me to adopt.</i>

714
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,462
You're not supposed to go here.

715
00:43:51,545 --> 00:43:53,047
Rebecca must not see you.

716
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,798
Later on, you might tell Rebecca

717
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,343
about her babies.

718
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,638
I'll prescribe medicines
so the baby will have a stronger hold.

719
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:01,680
Baby?

720
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:02,890
Anyone could be a possible suspect,

721
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:04,183
even his own wife.

722
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:06,268
<i>Didn't you know, Mrs. Palacios?</i>
<i>You are pregnant.</i>

723
00:44:06,352 --> 00:44:08,395
We were able to conceive a baby?
