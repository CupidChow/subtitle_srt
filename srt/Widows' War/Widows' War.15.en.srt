1
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,276
I had no motive to poison Basil.

2
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:09,861
I loved my husband.

3
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:14,074
If you think about it,
you had a bigger motive than me.

4
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:15,992
What did you say?!

5
00:01:16,076 --> 00:01:18,828
<i>Mother, they don't want me</i>
<i>near my husband,</i>

6
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,873
and now I'm even a suspect in his death!

7
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:24,000
Both of you are to blame!

8
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:27,086
We need to get your fingerprints
for our investigation.

9
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,838
- Is that okay?
- Jerico, are you okay?

10
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:31,424
<i>Ever since the party,</i>
<i>you've been restless.</i>

11
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,427
You're always looking for something.
You're always worried.

12
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:35,929
- What's the problem?
- Nothing!

13
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:37,180
Why do you keep pressing me?!

14
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:41,267
I told you a thousand times,
don't call me your sister.

15
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:44,854
Even if we count our wrinkles,
you will win.

16
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,189
For a dead loved one.

17
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,233
For a dead loved one, justice to be done.

18
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,692
Justice to be done…

19
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,987
PREVIOUSLY

20
00:01:53,404 --> 00:01:55,281
<i>Why are you crying over him, Aurora?</i>

21
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,034
He's my nephew, Amando.

22
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,329
He wanted to steal Paco's place
in the company.

23
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,747
It's a good thing that he is gone.

24
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,458
<i>He would have stolen your position too.</i>

25
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,885
Hey!

26
00:02:15,969 --> 00:02:18,304
Sir, they just asked me
to bring them here.

27
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:19,764
I'm being careful.

28
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,266
Very, very careful.

29
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:22,809
Wow, Louie.

30
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,144
It seems like only a little while ago

31
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,437
that the murder of
your Grandfather Gustavo and Auntie Diana

32
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,064
was the hot topic.

33
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,694
I heard about Mr. Paco.

34
00:02:32,777 --> 00:02:34,863
Didn't his wife become a suspect?

35
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:39,284
And now, it's Mr. Basil's wife
who is the suspect.

36
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,244
- My sister is not the killer!
- Ward!

37
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,871
Chill, it's fine.

38
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,247
Chill! Sorry!

39
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:48,543
So, shall we start?

40
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,712
Spirits…

41
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,798
Spirits…

42
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,050
Spirits, O hear us.

43
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:57,635
Hear us, O spirits.

44
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,387
Please tell us,

45
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,222
who poisoned Basil?

46
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,686
Do you guys really believe in this stuff?

47
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,570
Spirits!

48
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:17,739
Hear us!

49
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,533
Hear us, O spirits!

50
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:22,410
Please!

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,538
Who poisoned Basil?

52
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:39,886
L…

53
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,014
O…

54
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:43,932
O.

55
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:47,769
U…

56
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:50,563
I…

57
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,781
E…

58
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,574
- Louie?
- Louie?

59
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:03,534
What's that?

60
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,737
So you're a killer!

61
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,406
Ward!

62
00:04:41,489 --> 00:04:42,657
Did you do that on purpose?

63
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,742
Did you move the planchette?

64
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:45,952
Yes.

65
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:48,871
This killer is not taking this seriously.

66
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,873
I am not a killer!

67
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,292
- Hey, Louie! Louie, no!
- Hey! Hey!

68
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:54,377
- Ward! Louie! That's enough!
- Hey, stop it!

69
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:57,505
I…

70
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,304
I sense a presence.

71
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:10,310
Is that you, Basil?

72
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,229
Basil?

73
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,649
Basil?

74
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:21,112
Are you the one with us now?

75
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:23,197
Please,

76
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,074
tell me,

77
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,077
who poisoned you?

78
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,497
Who poisoned you, Basil?

79
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:06,449
The spirits won't tell me,

80
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,534
but…

81
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:11,245
I received a message.

82
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,336
Everyone will soon…

83
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,798
find out…

84
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:25,551
who poisoned Basil.

85
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,835
I will just encode this.

86
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,545
Okay.

87
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,215
Sir, where is Sarge Abdul?

88
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,883
- Dude.
- Sir.

89
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:11,472
I didn't tell anyone
about my relationship with George,

90
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,474
so can we just get back to work?

91
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,517
Over here, sir.

92
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:21,524
Sir!

93
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,151
Sir, someone is looking for you.

94
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,527
Thank you.

95
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,611
Sir, Sarge.

96
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:27,488
What is it?

97
00:07:27,572 --> 00:07:29,991
I know something that might possibly
help with Sir Basil's case.

98
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:31,951
What's that?

99
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,121
Sir, I was not the only one
who fought with him.

100
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,123
He also fought with someone
during the party.

101
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,543
I witnessed that and it was
also caught on CCTV.

102
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,195
Sir, this came from the crime lab.

103
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:09,947
It's the fingerprint match results
for Mr. Palacios' case.

104
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,032
Thank you.

105
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,925
So the other set of fingerprints
on Mr. Palacios' glass are his?

106
00:08:33,137 --> 00:08:35,598
We have our primary suspect, Villa.

107
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:45,566
- Is that complete?
- Yes.

108
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:56,577
Thanks. You can go.

109
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,058
Amando,

110
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:24,063
I was up the whole night thinking about
what you said at the wake.

111
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:26,440
Which thing?

112
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,859
We talked about a lot of things.

113
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:32,863
Why are you crying over him, Aurora?

114
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:34,448
You're just wasting your tears.

115
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,534
He's my nephew, Amando.

116
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:37,952
Who had no respect for you,

117
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,580
and who wanted to steal Paco's place
in the company.

118
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,206
It's a good thing that he is gone.

119
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,667
He would have stolen your position too.

120
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:48,588
It's about Basil.

121
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:51,924
When Paco died,

122
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:54,260
I saw you grieve.

123
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:57,930
But when Basil died, I saw nothing.

124
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:04,228
I loved Paco. He was like a son to me.

125
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,063
I know, Amando.

126
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,692
But you're not so mad at Basil

127
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,362
that you should be happy when he died.

128
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:18,618
Unless…

129
00:10:19,035 --> 00:10:20,453
Unless what?

130
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:26,250
I remember the last time I got drunk.

131
00:10:31,005 --> 00:10:34,175
Paco would not commit suicide!

132
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,969
My son wouldn't do that.

133
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:40,765
Aurora…

134
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:44,894
No, my son would not do that Amando!

135
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,229
He was killed! Paco was killed!

136
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:49,357
Aurora, that's enough.

137
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,944
If it wasn't Sam who killed my son,
then someone else did!

138
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,696
Someone else did!

139
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,240
Someone else did!

140
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,242
Who could it be?

141
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:07,083
Who else wants to steal Paco's position
in the company and in our family?

142
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,251
Who?

143
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,755
Basil.

144
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:15,299
Who else?

145
00:11:16,759 --> 00:11:21,680
If I could kill them, Amando,
I would do it.

146
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,601
I will kill my son's killer!

147
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:43,160
Tell me honestly, Amando.

148
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,788
Tell me the truth.

149
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,625
Did you poison Basil?

150
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:56,549
Did you kill him?

151
00:11:58,509 --> 00:11:59,802
For me?

152
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,148
Amando,

153
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:14,275
I need to know.

154
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,112
Did you poison Basil

155
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:20,573
for me?

156
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,743
- Francis, son.
- Mother!

157
00:12:24,827 --> 00:12:27,163
- Where are we going?
- Sam!

158
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,124
Mother, we're just going for a stroll
for some family bonding. Let's go.

159
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,216
Sam, let's go.

160
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:41,177
Sam!

161
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,430
Sam!

162
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:47,600
Why are you running?

163
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:50,019
Are you not thinking about my grandchild?

164
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,521
And you, Mercy?

165
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,023
You should know better!

166
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,274
No, Ma, it's because…

167
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:57,026
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

168
00:12:57,526 --> 00:12:59,111
It's my fault.

169
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,029
I'm sorry.

170
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:03,157
Baby, I'm sorry.

171
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,700
Uncle is just excited.

172
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:05,618
You're okay, right?

173
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,502
How about you? What are you doing here?

174
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,881
We have new evidence that points
to a new suspect.

175
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,299
We need to talk to that person.

176
00:13:20,716 --> 00:13:21,967
There's a new suspect?

177
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:28,641
Sam,

178
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,227
is it you?

179
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,520
It's not her.

180
00:13:34,396 --> 00:13:37,316
If it's not Sam, who is it?

181
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:41,570
Mr. Francis Castillo.

182
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,508
Sarge, my brother is innocent.

183
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,677
He had no reason to kill Basil.

184
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:05,803
Sam!

185
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:07,596
Sam, please take it easy.

186
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,515
- Sam!
- Hold on.

187
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,100
- Sam, please.
- I'm sorry.

188
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,726
- I'm sorry but you have to stay here.
- Okay.

189
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:14,436
Don't stress my grandchild.

190
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,398
Sit here for now. Let's wait here.

191
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:18,649
Sit down.

192
00:14:21,318 --> 00:14:22,444
Sit down.

193
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,573
Just calm down, Sam.

194
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:26,532
Calm down.

195
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,409
- Your brother is innocent.
- Here, give me that.

196
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,785
Thank you, Amando.

197
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:30,911
Here.

198
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,496
Drink some water.

199
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,274
Why are the press here?

200
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,526
I ordered a news blackout.

201
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:05,905
Okay, sir. I'll call the PR Department.

202
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:06,989
Never mind.

203
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,170
Mr. Palacios, is it true
that your son was poisoned?

204
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,588
Is this similar to what happened

205
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,672
to Mr. Paco Palacios?

206
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,924
Was it an accident too?

207
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,468
Any comments, sir,
on the two deaths in the family?

208
00:15:27,801 --> 00:15:29,428
Mr. Galvan, do you already have a suspect?

209
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:34,767
I'm requesting all of you to be patient.

210
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:37,770
Once the investigation is done,

211
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,230
you'll get your answers.

212
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,024
I will call for a press conference

213
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:47,446
but for now, please respect my request.

214
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,782
- Any information, sir?
- Confirmation, sir!

215
00:15:49,865 --> 00:15:51,700
- Later. Later, please.
- Any information, sir?

216
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,994
- Later, please.
- Sir Galvan--

217
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:19,019
Sarge, why am I a suspect?

218
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,105
I have nothing to do with Basil's death.

219
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:34,284
Someone reported to us that
you fought with Mr. Palacios.

220
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:36,286
It was caught on CCTV.

221
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,045
3K? Are you jerks?

222
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,422
My brother-in-law's jacket is branded.

223
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,465
If that's the case,
I'll just sell it to someone else.

224
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,967
You fool!

225
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:54,638
You are selling Paco's things?

226
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,518
Does Auntie Aurora know about this?

227
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:08,861
<i>Hey, peasant.</i>

228
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,654
<i>How dare you walk away from me?</i>

229
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,492
Don't report me to Ma'am Aurora, please.

230
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,579
Not only Auntie Aurora.

231
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:22,708
I will tell everyone at this party
that a thief is living here.

232
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,293
Especially your sister.

233
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,919
I am not a thief!

234
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:27,129
I'm not!

235
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:29,256
Stupid!

236
00:17:29,339 --> 00:17:30,674
You're so stupid!

237
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:32,176
What do you call what you were doing?

238
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,769
Stay down, lowlife!

239
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:47,816
Francis! Francis, don't!

240
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,907
You know, you look good together.

241
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,623
Two losers in one frame.

242
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,425
That's enough.

243
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,866
Sir, I had no…

244
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:41,453
I had no plans of hitting him
with that shovel.

245
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,747
I was just trying to scare him.

246
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,293
Mr. Castillo, how do you explain this?

247
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:54,758
Your fingerprints are
on Mr. Palacios' wine glass.

248
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:02,975
Yes, sir, that's right.

249
00:19:03,058 --> 00:19:07,855
The reason I touched his glass
was because after we fought,

250
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,816
I got scared
that he might really report me.

251
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:12,568
<i>I was nervous because…</i>

252
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,571
<i>I was sure I'd be in trouble with Sam</i>

253
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,907
<i>once she found out</i>
<i>that I was selling Paco's jackets.</i>

254
00:19:20,033 --> 00:19:22,452
<i>I went looking for Basil. I was restless.</i>

255
00:19:22,536 --> 00:19:24,204
<i>So to calm my nerves…</i>

256
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:26,415
Hey, why are you drinking that?

257
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,333
That's Sir Basil's!

258
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,544
I'm sorry.

259
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,381
- I was just trying to calm myself. Sorry.
- There are a lot of drinks at the bar.

260
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,008
Just get one over there.

261
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:46,685
Sir, I touched it accidentally.

262
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,230
Please believe me. You can even ask Peter.

263
00:19:50,314 --> 00:19:51,732
Believe me.

264
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:52,941
He knows.

265
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,164
Sam…

266
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,958
My child, calm down.

267
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,461
Your brother is innocent.

268
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:30,520
The staff that we talked to

269
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,316
said that you have lung cancer.

270
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,484
Is that right?

271
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:36,860
Yes, sir.

272
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,570
I have.

273
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:44,159
One of the medicines for lung cancer is…

274
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,744
morphine.

275
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:48,622
Right?

276
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:50,999
Yes, sir, but that's not the
morphine mixed

277
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,378
in Basil's drink.

278
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:58,674
Can you prove that?

279
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,633
Yes, sir.

280
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:00,884
We can go to my room.

281
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:02,552
You can check it.

282
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:03,637
I've only consumed five tablets

283
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,848
because the doctor gave me that
five days ago.

284
00:21:06,932 --> 00:21:09,268
I will show it to you. Let's go.

285
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:21,571
- Francis, what happened? Is it over?
- Not yet.

286
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,658
I'll just show Sarge that my morphine
wasn't used to poison Basil.

287
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,535
- Come on, this way.
- What?

288
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,217
George?

289
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:45,345
You're going to the wake,
but you're not welcome there.

290
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,514
What? Will you just hang back
and watch from afar?

291
00:21:47,597 --> 00:21:50,726
Mother, what's important is that
I'm there for my husband.

292
00:21:58,567 --> 00:21:59,985
Hey.

293
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:03,238
What are you doing
in George's baby room, huh?

294
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,244
You're trespassing, Vivian!

295
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,371
No, I'm not.

296
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,540
I'm just looking at the room.

297
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:16,626
I'm thinking what design
would be good here.

298
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,213
Because after Basil's burial,

299
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,966
Sofia and I will live here.

300
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:26,136
You can't touch this room.

301
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:28,722
Why?

302
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:31,099
No one is using this room.

303
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,101
No one sleeps here.

304
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:36,980
And besides, there's no baby.

305
00:22:38,148 --> 00:22:39,941
You're not pregnant, right?

306
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,943
And you can't get pregnant,

307
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,570
especially now that Basil is gone.

308
00:22:44,446 --> 00:22:45,489
- You're rude!
- Hey!

309
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,032
Hey, you fool!

310
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,700
- Hey! Mother!
- You're so shameless!

311
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,452
You should be ashamed!

312
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,162
Let's go here, sir.

313
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:57,834
Here, sir.

314
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:06,802
Here, sir.

315
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,930
Here's the prescription
given by my doctor five days ago.

316
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,184
You're right.

317
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:18,271
You've had this for five days now.

318
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,107
- Is this the one?
- Yes, sir.

319
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:22,192
So there should be 25 pieces.

320
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,485
Yes, sir.

321
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:33,286
How come there are only 17?

322
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:37,290
- Huh? Seventeen?
- Where are the other eight tablets?

323
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,212
Sir, that's impossible.

324
00:23:42,295 --> 00:23:44,256
I've only taken five tablets.
Wait a second.

325
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:54,349
Wait, sir, I'll just look for it.

326
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:58,061
It's impossible. I've only taken five.

327
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,188
I can't be wrong.

328
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:21,751
Mr. Castillo…

329
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,337
you need to go with us.

330
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:26,339
Sir, I really have
nothing to do with it, sir.

331
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,549
Sir…

332
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:30,969
Sir, I'm telling the truth, sir.
I have nothing to do with this, sir.

333
00:24:31,052 --> 00:24:32,304
- I am innocent.
- Let's talk about this.

334
00:24:32,387 --> 00:24:33,972
Wait a second.
My brother is innocent.

335
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,224
Sir, you can't do this to me.
Sir, it wasn't me.

336
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,143
- Please move, ma'am.
- I wasn't the one who poisoned him, sir.

337
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,061
- Sir, it wasn't me.
- Mr. Castillo…

338
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:41,646
- Sir.
- Come with us.

339
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:43,523
- You can't do this to me.
- Sir. Please, sir.

340
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,649
- Sir, don't touch me, sir!
- Ma'am.

341
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:46,526
- Sir, I have nothing to do with this!
- Wait!

342
00:24:46,610 --> 00:24:47,777
- I didn't poison him!
- That's enough!

343
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:50,697
- Hold on! Sam!
- For the murder of Basil Palacios.

344
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,200
- Sir, wait. Hold on! Wait!
- Later.

345
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:57,329
- Wait! Wait! Wait! I didn't poison him!
- You have the right to remain silent.

346
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,914
I didn't poison him!
Wait a second! It wasn't me!

347
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,291
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

348
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:02,792
- Don't resist anymore.
- Sir! Sam! Mother!

349
00:25:02,876 --> 00:25:05,670
Come on. Let's go.
Let's talk later at the police station.

350
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,672
- We will talk to him.
- Sir, hold on!

351
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,217
I had nothing to do with it, sir!
Please believe me!

352
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,220
Please believe me.
I had nothing to do with it!

353
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,262
- Sir!
- Come on.

354
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:16,181
- Ma'am, ma'am…
- Hey! Hey!

355
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,599
Vivian, stop it!

356
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,059
- What's with you?
- Come here!

357
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,393
- I won't forget this!
- Stop pushing me!

358
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:22,312
- Stop it! Vivian, that's enough!
- I haven't forgotten!

359
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,271
Mother, that's enough!

360
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,774
- I won't forget this!
- Stop it!

361
00:25:25,857 --> 00:25:27,359
- Stop it! That's enough!
- Trash!

362
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,361
- Stop!
- Your mother is trash!

363
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:33,073
Stop! Stop! I said stop!
That's enough!

364
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,075
Vivian, I'm a difficult enemy to face.

365
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:36,493
Don't you dare touch this room!

366
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,453
Why? What will you do to me?

367
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:41,581
Are you going to kill me
like you killed your husband?!

368
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,251
- I'm the one who will kill you!
- What now?

369
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:46,419
- George! George!
- Mother, what's wrong with you?

370
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,505
The police are arresting Francis.

371
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,799
What?

372
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:54,135
Abdul said it was him who poisoned Basil.

373
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:06,982
This way.

374
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,817
- Let's go, let's go!
- Sir! I didn't poison him, sir!

375
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,777
- Animal! You poisoned my son!
- It wasn't me!

376
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:13,780
- This isn't right.
- Animal!

377
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,991
- I will kill you!
- Please no!

378
00:26:16,074 --> 00:26:17,158
Wait!

379
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,703
- Animal!
- That's enough, sir!

380
00:26:19,786 --> 00:26:22,747
- Hey! Where are you going? Go after him!
- Francis!

381
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:24,416
- Wait!
- Francis!

382
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,627
- Where are you going?
- Francis!

383
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,633
- Sir.
- Francis!

384
00:26:33,717 --> 00:26:34,634
Francis!

385
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,720
What are you waiting for? Shoot him!

386
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,138
- Francis!
- Shoot him!

387
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:39,973
- Shoot him!
- Mother!

388
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,517
- Shoot him!
- No!

389
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,893
- Mother!
- No, don't!

390
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:45,979
- Mr. Palacios, we can't do that!
- Don't do it!

391
00:26:46,062 --> 00:26:46,813
Let go!

392
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:48,189
No!

393
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:51,818
Ma'am Rebecca?

394
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,737
Where are you going? What will you do?

395
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:56,323
The truth.

396
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,991
I need to know the truth.

397
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,034
What truth?

398
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,160
Ma'am Rebecca…

399
00:27:10,337 --> 00:27:12,047
Here, sit down.

400
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:18,511
This is not what I understood from
what was whispered to me.

401
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,139
There's something wrong.

402
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:26,936
Something is wrong.

403
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,086
- Mother!
- Mother!

404
00:27:51,169 --> 00:27:52,212
Don't! Mother!

405
00:27:52,295 --> 00:27:54,047
Don't! Don't! Don't!

406
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,548
Don't! Don't!

407
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,384
I'm begging you, don't!

408
00:27:57,467 --> 00:27:59,219
My brother is innocent.

409
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,595
Sam, get out of the way!

410
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:28,081
Justice to be done for a dead loved one.

411
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,418
For a dead loved one, justice to be done.

412
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,588
Justice to be done for a dead loved one.

413
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,633
For a dead loved one, justice to be done.

414
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:43,805
Justice to be done for a dead loved one.

415
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,265
Pa, go ahead and continue.

416
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,307
Shoot him!

417
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:47,350
No!

418
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,563
- No, no, no, no!
- Mr. Palacios…

419
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:53,064
I'm warning you.

420
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:54,899
Put down the gun.

421
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,861
- Please stop!
- Pa, he poisoned Basil!

422
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,448
No, he didn't! Please stop.

423
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,867
Justice to be done…

424
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,704
Justice to be done for a dead loved one!

425
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,957
For a dead loved one, justice to be done.

426
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,293
Justice to be done for a dead loved one.

427
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,379
For a dead loved one, justice to be done.

428
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,759
Justice to be done…

429
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,601
Sam! Sam!

430
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:31,478
Galvan!

431
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:36,316
- Galvan!
- Go, move!

432
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:38,318
Francis!

433
00:29:38,401 --> 00:29:39,861
Francis! Francis!

434
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,613
- Sam!
- Are you okay?

435
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,825
- Killer.
- Sam.

436
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,619
Animal!

437
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,871
Why did you kill my husband?

438
00:29:49,954 --> 00:29:52,165
- You're evil!
- Enough!

439
00:29:52,248 --> 00:29:55,168
- It wasn't me!
- That's enough! Stop it!

440
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:56,503
My daughter was accused,

441
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:58,797
but it turns out that it was
your brother who did it!

442
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,382
That's enough! Ward, take them away.

443
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,967
Come on, George.

444
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,261
- Sam, I'm innocent.
- Let's go, Francis.

445
00:30:05,345 --> 00:30:06,513
- Help me, Sam.
- Wait!

446
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,847
- Hold on!
- Let him go, please.

447
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:08,723
I'm innocent.

448
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:10,809
- I will find a way out of this!
- Sam, help me!

449
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:11,976
Go!

450
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,770
- Sam, help me!
- Go on.

451
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,105
- Animal! You poisoned my son!
- Sarge! Sarge!

452
00:30:16,189 --> 00:30:17,774
- Mr. Palacios!
- Animal!

453
00:30:18,274 --> 00:30:19,234
Animal!

454
00:30:19,317 --> 00:30:20,944
Galvan, enough!

455
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:25,490
Mother!

456
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,950
Mother…

457
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:31,037
Mother…

458
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:41,840
Sam, is it true that I can't get out while
they are still investigating the case?

459
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:43,424
I don't know.

460
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,677
I haven't talked to Sergeant Casas,

461
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,514
but you need to stay here for now.

462
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:52,141
Shit. Sorry.

463
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:55,144
Be strong, Francis.

464
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,065
Be strong.

465
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,944
Be strong, my child.

466
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,863
Sam…

467
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:06,406
I don't want to be jailed here.

468
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:08,575
I didn't poison Basil.

469
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:10,577
Help me, please, Sam. Help me.

470
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,413
- I know.
- Help me.

471
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:15,498
I will find a way.

472
00:31:15,582 --> 00:31:16,958
I will find a way.

473
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:19,544
I will ask for help from Ma'am Aurora.

474
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:21,379
I will fix this.

475
00:31:21,462 --> 00:31:22,422
I will fix this.

476
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,174
We will get a good lawyer.

477
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,218
Help me, Sam, please.

478
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,846
I don't want to be jailed.

479
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,181
I don't want to be jailed, Mother.

480
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:36,603
- Just have patience. We will find a way.
- Please, Mother.

481
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,813
I am innocent.

482
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:41,441
I didn't do anything.

483
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,235
We already know that.

484
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:46,821
We know that it wasn't your fault.

485
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:49,240
We know that.

486
00:31:54,037 --> 00:31:57,999
So, Amando, it wasn't you
who poisoned Basil.

487
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:00,418
I'm relieved to know.

488
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:04,339
But I didn't expect it
to be that stupid boy.

489
00:32:06,257 --> 00:32:07,425
You will help him?

490
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:10,595
Why would I?

491
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:14,057
He's Sam's brother.
Your grandchild's uncle.

492
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,809
And so?

493
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:19,562
It's a good thing

494
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:22,482
that one of the three
will be out of the picture.

495
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:24,817
Now I only have to worry about
the other two Castillos.

496
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:29,030
Will you drive away the Castillos?

497
00:32:29,489 --> 00:32:31,074
But of course.

498
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:34,702
I will just wait for Sam
to give birth to my grandchild.

499
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:37,664
Then after that, they're out.

500
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,843
Sam, how did this happen?

501
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:54,514
How did Francis become a suspect?
Did someone frame him?

502
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:58,351
I think it was George.

503
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,771
It was George who took Francis' morphine.

504
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:05,984
Go find out the truth.

505
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:09,737
I will die if your brother
doesn't get out of jail.

506
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,537
Why are you crying?

507
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:31,134
Mother…

508
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:41,185
It's all my fault.

509
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:46,566
Francis just got dragged into it.

510
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,987
What do you mean it's your fault?

511
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:59,871
I stole Francis' morphine.

512
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,332
Finally.

513
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,918
George is acquitted.

514
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,756
I don't have to ask the spirits
who killed Basil.

515
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:13,342
God, thank you so much for the fact that
George will not lose her inheritance

516
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,345
and we will no longer be kicked out
of here or be poor again.

517
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,139
Thank you so much!

518
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,057
Mother…

519
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,478
George, there's nothing wrong
with me giving thanks to God.

520
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:27,356
But you know, we still have one problem.

521
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:29,776
It's that pest, Vivian!

522
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,362
I hope what she said about them
living here is not true.

523
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,116
Sofia will live here?

524
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:43,456
Wait a second.

525
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:47,460
If Francis poisoned Basil,

526
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:55,051
that means that the morphine
found in your possession was his.

527
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,429
The morphine that was planted
in your things.

528
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,517
I'm the one who placed it
in George's drawer.

529
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:04,852
What?

530
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,901
That means the Castillos set you up!

531
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,277
That family is really shameless!

532
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:17,448
They want to destroy our family.
They are animals!

533
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,122
At Basil's burial…

534
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,668
I want you to carry this.

535
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,970
Sorry for doubting you.

536
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:50,439
Why did Basil want George killed?

537
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,025
Why did he order you to do it?

538
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:55,153
Why did you agree?

539
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,407
Samantha, answer me!

540
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,285
Why did you agree to do
what Basil wanted?

541
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:07,748
Because he was able to record a video
of what happened on the cliff.

542
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,423
What video?

543
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:16,799
What cliff?

544
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:30,897
Mother, I accidentally
pushed Paco off the cliff.

545
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,565
What?

546
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,652
It was your sister who pushed my boss!

547
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,862
You fool!

548
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:39,572
Stop it! Francis!

549
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,741
Don't accuse my sister!
You're crazy!

550
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,872
Mother, I didn't mean to.

551
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:49,790
I didn't mean to.

552
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:51,709
But in the video,

553
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,420
it looks like I did it intentionally.

554
00:36:54,503 --> 00:37:00,384
That's why Basil was using it
to blackmail me and make me kill George.

555
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,720
I will not leak the video
but on one condition.

556
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:05,765
I want you to kill my wife.

557
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,227
But Mother, I didn't do it.

558
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,561
I couldn't.

559
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,688
I couldn't kill George.

560
00:37:12,772 --> 00:37:13,856
I couldn't do it.

561
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,788
That's why…

562
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,540
you poisoned Basil?

563
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,959
Mother, no!

564
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,544
It wasn't me who killed Basil.

565
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:38,965
I don't know… I don't know who did it.

566
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,758
I don't know who, but…

567
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:47,265
but I think it was Francis' morphine
that was used to kill Basil.

568
00:38:03,447 --> 00:38:06,909
Did you steal Francis' morphine?

569
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:10,162
You involved your brother in this mess
you got yourself into?!

570
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:12,999
You put your brother in danger!

571
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,710
You're the reason he's in jail!

572
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:19,171
You! It's your fault!

573
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:24,885
Mother, forgive me.

574
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,932
Forgive me, please.

575
00:38:32,351 --> 00:38:34,020
I will forgive you

576
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:38,190
when you get your brother out of jail.

577
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,068
What happened?

578
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,779
Ma'am, I'm sorry but it seems
the car broke down.

579
00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:09,365
So how are we going to bring
the casket inside?

580
00:40:09,448 --> 00:40:10,616
We will carry it.

581
00:40:13,369 --> 00:40:14,537
Everyone,

582
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,789
carry the casket.

583
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:42,356
Let me.

584
00:40:44,066 --> 00:40:45,234
Inigo?

585
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:17,683
Francis…

586
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,811
Francis.

587
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,149
Sam…

588
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:27,151
Francis…

589
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:32,031
Sam, it's difficult here.

590
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,286
I'm scared of the inmates
I'm in with, Sam.

591
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:38,579
I can't sleep.

592
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:47,273
Who poisoned Basil?
Why am I being accused?

593
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,943
Why have I been dragged into this?

594
00:43:54,757 --> 00:43:55,924
Inigo…

595
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,135
I didn't know you were here.

596
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,430
When did you arrive?

597
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,934
A couple of days ago.

598
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,312
God.

599
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,066
And this is what you see.

600
00:44:19,406 --> 00:44:20,407
Wait.

601
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,910
Excuse me. George?

602
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,578
I need you to meet someone.

603
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,380
This is Attorney Inigo Morales.

604
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,716
He's Basil's best friend.

605
00:44:45,307 --> 00:44:47,976
Please help me, Sam.

606
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,189
- Yes, Francis.
- Please help me.

607
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,360
I will do everything I can
to get you out of here,

608
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:58,737
I promise you that.

609
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:16,463
George, Basil's wife.

610
00:45:17,714 --> 00:45:19,091
Nice to meet you, Attorney.

611
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,636
Why did Basil never tell me about you?

612
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,271
NEXT EPISODE

613
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:34,690
Nor do parents with dead children.

614
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,316
You still have Sofia.

615
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,195
As for me, I'm looking forward
to Paco's child.

616
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,738
It's unfair!

617
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,324
Basil didn't even leave me
with a grandchild.

618
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:46,410
We have an unwanted guest, Mother.

619
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:49,538
- Beverly?
- Basil and I had an affair.

620
00:45:49,621 --> 00:45:53,208
So the baby you're carrying
belongs to Basil?

621
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,585
You're unbelievable!

622
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,128
At least I'm not a murderer.

623
00:45:56,211 --> 00:45:58,255
<i>It was you who sent me this, right?</i>

624
00:45:58,338 --> 00:45:59,173
<i>You want me dead.</i>

625
00:45:59,256 --> 00:46:01,049
You wanted Basil all to yourself

626
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,302
and for him to take responsibility
for your baby.

627
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:04,595
<i>Uncle Galvan…</i>

628
00:46:04,678 --> 00:46:06,597
<i>If you're here to plead</i>
<i>about your brother,</i>

629
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:07,973
you're wasting your time.

630
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:09,516
He killed my son!

631
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,393
Oh my God, you're bleeding!

632
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,562
Oh no! My grandchild!
