1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,724
<i>I dreamed of Paco.</i>

2
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:16,683
‪PREVIOUSLY

3
00:00:16,766 --> 00:00:18,018
<i>He's my husband.</i>

4
00:00:18,101 --> 00:00:20,061
<i>He's the love of my life.</i>

5
00:00:20,145 --> 00:00:22,230
I killed my own husband.

6
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:25,775
You know, no one should know
that you're here.

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,360
It's too dangerous.

8
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:28,945
Our plans will be destroyed, Paco.

9
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:31,531
Mom, don't worry.

10
00:00:31,614 --> 00:00:33,241
No one found out.

11
00:00:33,324 --> 00:00:35,660
Vivian, did you go
to Aurora's house again?

12
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:37,120
She called me and was going amok.

13
00:00:37,203 --> 00:00:38,121
I knew it.

14
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:39,497
Your sister is guilty.

15
00:00:39,581 --> 00:00:41,207
She is really hiding something.

16
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,917
<i>What if what she's hiding there</i>

17
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,211
<i>is the killer?</i>

18
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,922
I have a feeling
everything started with me.

19
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:51,134
If I hadn't pushed Paco,

20
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,136
Basil would not have blackmailed me.

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,014
<i>And then I would not have stolen</i>
<i>Francis' morphine, and</i>

22
00:00:56,097 --> 00:00:58,349
<i>there would be no chaos. And then</i>
<i>Francis would not have gone to jail.</i>

23
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:01,061
You should forgive yourself.

24
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:04,689
It's not your job
to find the Palacios killer

25
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,608
because you're not a Palacios.

26
00:01:06,691 --> 00:01:09,694
Then make me one, Galvan. Marry me.

27
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:12,447
Galvan Palacios, will you marry me?

28
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,823
Stop your illusion.

29
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,868
I cannot marry you
and I will not marry you.

30
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,369
Don't you love me?

31
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,496
Love?

32
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,375
Look at you.

33
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,628
After all the money that I gave you,

34
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,046
you still look cheap.

35
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:31,216
<i>You're so desperate</i>
<i>for attention, for recognition.</i>

36
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,675
<i>It's disgusting.</i>

37
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:35,261
<i>And you, Galvan… And you, Aurora…</i>

38
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:38,097
<i>I will bring all of you down.</i>

39
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,769
We will all fall in the mud together.

40
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:45,939
Attorney, this is my daughter, Sofia.

41
00:01:46,022 --> 00:01:47,649
Hello, Sofia.

42
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:50,068
Sofia, this is Attorney Quinto,

43
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:54,280
my lawyer and
your soon-to-be private teacher.

44
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,448
Private teacher?

45
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:58,993
Yes. He will teach you
business management.

46
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:02,914
How to make financial records
and balance sheets,

47
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,125
and basically how to run a company.

48
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:07,794
<i>Dad, I want to be involved.</i>

49
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:09,379
I am still Basil's wife.

50
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,382
You don't know anything
about running a company.

51
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,552
Now, be a dear, and leave us in peace.

52
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:25,645
My goodness!

53
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:34,195
What have you done?

54
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:37,031
That's the last photo of me and my son.

55
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,992
I'm so sorry. I'll replace it.

56
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,369
You can't replace that.

57
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,413
Everything you touch gets destroyed.

58
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:46,791
That photo, my son.

59
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,301
You were with George Palacios?

60
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,011
I asked her where your room is

61
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,846
and then she showed me that.

62
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,731
Paco…

63
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:13,234
Basil, Beverly, Peter…

64
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:18,114
What's with that?

65
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,825
All of them…

66
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:23,745
All of the what?

67
00:03:25,371 --> 00:03:27,582
They have all done something
wrong to George.

68
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,669
All the victims fought with George.

69
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,464
Could it be…

70
00:03:34,547 --> 00:03:36,466
that George is the Palacios killer?

71
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,052
<i>Don't they know that you're barren?</i>

72
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:43,056
I swear to God, I will stab this woman.

73
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,308
Ma'am George, I'm sorry.

74
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,101
Sorry?

75
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:49,312
After you connived with Beverly

76
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,606
to make me look bad, I'm sorry?

77
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:54,567
You're so bad, Peter.

78
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,244
What did you say?

79
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,331
Everything I touch gets destroyed?

80
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,084
Including Basil?

81
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:16,923
Are you still blaming me
for Basil's death?

82
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,134
Are you still blaming me for his death?

83
00:04:20,218 --> 00:04:22,178
Is that right, Dad?

84
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,017
- Answer me.
- Yes.

85
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,104
I'm blaming you for the death of my son.

86
00:04:31,854 --> 00:04:32,730
I've always wondered…

87
00:04:32,814 --> 00:04:35,525
if he hadn't married you,

88
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,695
would he still be alive right now?

89
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,582
Sam…

90
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:54,210
Before they became Palacioses,

91
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,962
she and George had always been enemies.

92
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,798
Even before, they always argued.

93
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,635
And their husbands always fought
because of them.

94
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,929
Come on.

95
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,347
We already know that.

96
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,307
What's new?

97
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:09,684
Peter…

98
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,854
He stole Basil's jewelry

99
00:05:12,937 --> 00:05:14,939
and even made an attempt on George's life.

100
00:05:15,815 --> 00:05:16,858
How about Beverly?

101
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:19,402
Isn't it obvious?

102
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,280
She's carrying Basil's illegitimate child.

103
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,949
During the gender reveal,

104
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,994
George almost slit Beverly's neck.

105
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,829
How about Basil Palacios?

106
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:33,416
What's Ms. Georgina's motive
for killing him?

107
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,925
Dad, Basil was murdered.

108
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,095
I didn't kill him.

109
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,056
Someone else poisoned him.

110
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,183
How is that my fault?

111
00:05:52,268 --> 00:05:55,730
My only fault is that I loved your son.

112
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,191
I obeyed him.

113
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:00,193
I served him.

114
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,613
My entire world centered on him.

115
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:08,659
When did being a good wife become a sin?

116
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:15,041
George, stop crying.

117
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,044
Enough, George.

118
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:19,921
Just forget what I said.

119
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,297
No, Dad.

120
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:24,842
You already said it.

121
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,596
Now I know what you truly feel for me.

122
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,975
So, go ahead. It's me.

123
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,311
Everything is on me. I was wrong.

124
00:06:35,394 --> 00:06:36,896
I'm at fault.

125
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,190
I put Basil in danger.

126
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,067
Are you happy now?

127
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,615
I interviewed Ms. Georgina several times

128
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,534
when her husband died.

129
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,035
She loves him so much.

130
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:54,455
Why would she kill her husband?

131
00:06:56,457 --> 00:06:58,543
It could be for money.

132
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,171
Money? That's impossible.

133
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:05,174
Her inheritance from her husband
is still on hold.

134
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,678
Maybe because of jealousy.

135
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,224
Maybe when George found out
Basil had a mistress,

136
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,475
she killed him.

137
00:07:14,559 --> 00:07:16,644
Maybe, maybe, maybe. It's all maybe.

138
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:20,898
You know, bro, what you're saying

139
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:21,983
will not stand in court.

140
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:26,070
We need concrete evidence.

141
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,699
Or it's possible
that George Palacios may want

142
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:32,243
to be free from her husband
because she loves someone else.

143
00:07:34,787 --> 00:07:37,290
She wants to reconcile
with her old boyfriend,

144
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,711
Sergeant Abdul Casas,

145
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:45,006
the former lead of this case.

146
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,635
Go ahead, Dad.

147
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:53,723
Blame me.

148
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,100
Vent your ill feelings.

149
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,186
I said stop it.

150
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:00,188
Don't you want to stop?

151
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,690
All you care about is your feelings,

152
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,650
and how you're so oppressed.

153
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,570
That's what you're good at.

154
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:09,780
You always want to play the victim.

155
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:11,949
Dad, stop it.

156
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:14,911
Let's just leave George alone.

157
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,540
Attorney, Sofia.

158
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,084
Let's just go to a different room,

159
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,712
so we can continue our meeting.

160
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,341
And you, stay here.

161
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:31,469
Clean up the mess that you made.

162
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:34,722
Come on, let's go.

163
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,157
George…

164
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,034
Mother…

165
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:17,306
How did you get that?

166
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,016
I'm wondering.

167
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,186
You and Sergeant Casas are good,

168
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:24,564
but you don't have a strong theory

169
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,607
for the Palacios killings.

170
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:28,484
We're looking at a lot of options.

171
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,571
That's why I did research
and I learned about that.

172
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:35,866
There's a conflict of interest
in Sergeant Casas

173
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,410
because his ex-girlfriend

174
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,371
could possibly be
the Palacios serial killer.

175
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,999
Sarge…

176
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,627
Abdul Casas is a decent officer.

177
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,296
Okay, let's just say

178
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:51,215
he had a relationship
with Ms. Georgina before.

179
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,883
But, Abdul was fair

180
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,260
in investigating this case.

181
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,137
But, why don't you think

182
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:58,431
that the common denominator
of all the victims

183
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,473
was George Palacios?

184
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,183
Because we need concrete evidence

185
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,727
against Ms. Georgina.

186
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,061
There's none…

187
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,022
because the direction
of your investigation is wrong.

188
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:10,192
If there's something I learned
from my previous case,

189
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,819
a murder case,

190
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:15,448
everyone is a possible suspect.

191
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,825
Even his child, his in-law,

192
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:20,036
or his own spouse.

193
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:53,903
Auro, darling.

194
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,822
You have a fabulous visitor today.

195
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,282
Auntie Larry.

196
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,035
OMG, it's been a while.

197
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:02,870
What brings you here?

198
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,708
I just came to pay the old queen a visit.

199
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,585
- Oh.
- Yeah.

200
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,338
Do you have babies?

201
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:18,177
I thought you had a miscarriage
with Uncle Alexander.

202
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,181
Oh, yes.

203
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:26,352
Yes, I had a miscarriage
with my baby with Xander

204
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:29,063
But…

205
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:33,192
a good friend of mine
persuaded me to adopt,

206
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:34,652
so yes.

207
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:36,404
I didn't know that.

208
00:11:37,029 --> 00:11:40,408
Well, maybe next time you can bring them,

209
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,618
so I can meet them.

210
00:11:43,828 --> 00:11:46,080
Of course. Of course.

211
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,540
Why not?

212
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,624
That's great.

213
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,632
Why is it like that, Mother?

214
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:59,927
I just want to be happy.

215
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,724
I thought when Basil married me,

216
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:08,894
I would become happy.

217
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,190
I thought I'd get the good life

218
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,277
that I dreamed of.

219
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,405
Why did I end up in hell?

220
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,074
That is exaggerated.

221
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,870
We became happy.

222
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:29,081
Your life became better
when you met Basil.

223
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:32,543
Things became chaos when he died.

224
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,548
Why did Basil die early?

225
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:40,301
Who killed him?

226
00:12:40,384 --> 00:12:41,719
George…

227
00:12:42,511 --> 00:12:45,055
only God can answer that.

228
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:49,894
Just trust, George.

229
00:12:49,977 --> 00:12:53,397
Just trust and everything
will be all right.

230
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,904
If Basil were still here,

231
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,615
I wouldn't feel like this.

232
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:05,659
I wouldn't be out of place.

233
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,870
I wouldn't be ignored.

234
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,877
Maybe things would have been different
if I had had a baby.

235
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,302
Speaking of the devil…

236
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,513
Excuse me.

237
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:42,196
<i>Hola.</i>

238
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,930
You're not supposed to go here, Larry.

239
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:10,182
If you want to visit me,

240
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,476
you should see me in the mines.

241
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:16,105
Auro, the wrinkles.

242
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:18,566
Don't waste your Botox.

243
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,067
Why are you hot-headed?

244
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,528
Because you're stupid.

245
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:24,697
Rebecca must not see you.

246
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:26,991
Why the hell not?

247
00:14:27,074 --> 00:14:29,577
Because you're a loose canon.

248
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,162
You can't control your mouth.

249
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:33,080
And you know that.

250
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,457
You might tell Rebecca

251
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,794
about her babies.

252
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,256
You don't trust me.

253
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,175
Let me remind you,

254
00:14:46,176 --> 00:14:48,679
It was you who came to me,

255
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,598
to us,

256
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:52,266
to adopt the kids.

257
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:56,145
Because I pity you and Barry.

258
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,147
You both lost your kids.

259
00:14:58,230 --> 00:15:00,608
That's why I gave them to you
for adoption.

260
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,359
And we owe you that debt of gratitude?

261
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,361
Of course.

262
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:06,113
Maybe you've forgotten?

263
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:10,576
I saved you from your miseries, Larry.

264
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,548
Auntie Aurora.

265
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,134
Auntie Larry, why are you fighting?

266
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,722
Fighting?

267
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,561
Well, because this old witch
is unbelievable.

268
00:15:37,645 --> 00:15:38,646
She's mad at me

269
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:41,190
because I came to visit
without telling her.

270
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,317
Her schedule got ruined.

271
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,235
What a piece of work.

272
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:13,472
I think if I had a baby,

273
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:18,435
Dad wouldn't treat me this way.

274
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,314
He would love me
the way Auntie Aurora loves Sam.

275
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,110
He would protect me.

276
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:29,780
He won't let anything or anyone harm me.

277
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,161
But there's nothing we can do, George.

278
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:41,125
Maybe it's really your fate
not to become a mother.

279
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,421
Why can't I have children, Mother?

280
00:16:57,141 --> 00:17:01,103
Auntie Larry, I'm sorry
about Auntie Aurora.

281
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:05,357
Oh, my darling Rebecca.

282
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:06,984
You don't have to apologize

283
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,154
for that female reincarnation of Satan.

284
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,614
And besides, I'm fine.

285
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,950
I'm used to her mean ways.

286
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,418
What's wrong?

287
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:32,009
Is visiting without prior notice
the only issue?

288
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:34,595
Is there something else?

289
00:17:38,599 --> 00:17:39,683
Why do you ask?

290
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:44,188
It's Auntie Aurora.

291
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:49,068
I've noticed something with her…

292
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:52,780
I think she's hiding something from me.

293
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:55,908
Every time I try to ask her,

294
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,410
she becomes hot-tempered.

295
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:06,168
Does she have a problem
that I should know about?

296
00:18:09,213 --> 00:18:12,633
George, don't think about it.

297
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:15,260
Nothing will change.

298
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,597
But remember,

299
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,852
even if you don't have children,
we are here.

300
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,522
Me and Ward.

301
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,775
We're always here for you.

302
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,069
Just be thankful…

303
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:35,405
that our family
is still complete. Right, George?

304
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,636
Nothing. Nothing.

305
00:18:57,719 --> 00:18:59,763
I'm sure it's nothing.

306
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:04,143
Auro is just like that, exaggerated.

307
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,604
Or maybe she's going through
her second cycle of menopause.

308
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:09,648
I don't know.

309
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:11,650
Anyway, I have to go.

310
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:15,195
- Ta-ta.
- But--

311
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,740
But Auntie, please don't forget.
Next time you go here,

312
00:19:18,824 --> 00:19:21,660
please bring your babies
so I can get to meet them.

313
00:19:24,746 --> 00:19:27,624
You know what? Don't worry.

314
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:31,336
You will get to meet her, soon.

315
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:33,839
That's great.

316
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:39,178
Bye.

317
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,432
Take care.

318
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:28,018
I now understand you, Rebecca.

319
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:33,607
I know now how it feels like

320
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:37,110
to live in a mansion… a palace,

321
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:39,863
and still feel alone.

322
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:43,951
Even though Mother and Ward are there,

323
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:46,078
I still have the feeling that I'm alone.

324
00:20:55,212 --> 00:20:57,631
Isn't that Sergeant Royales?

325
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,508
What are they doing here?

326
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,306
Sergeant Royales, how are you?

327
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,392
Are there any updates
on the investigation?

328
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,060
I believe that's something

329
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,813
the investigator and I
should discuss privately.

330
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:15,816
Sir, it's better if we talk about it

331
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,067
in front of them.

332
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:22,239
We found the common link
of all the targets.

333
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,367
Samantha Palacios, Basil Palacios,

334
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,078
Peter Pambid, and Ms. Beverly Maison.

335
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:33,709
Well…

336
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,586
they're all Palacioses
or assumed Palacioses

337
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:38,547
at the time of their deaths, right?

338
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,424
And there's so much more.

339
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,095
All of them had a fight
or disagreement with one person.

340
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,849
So, do you think that person
might be involved

341
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:50,392
in all of these killings?

342
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:52,561
Who?

343
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:55,230
Who is the common link
between all of them?

344
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,773
It's you, Mrs. Palacios.

345
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:00,569
And we want to talk to you.

346
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,780
Me? Why me?

347
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,368
Is it true that you fought
with the victims?

348
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,121
Beverly Maison,

349
00:22:11,204 --> 00:22:12,331
Sam Palacios,

350
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:14,666
Peter Pambid, and Basil Palacios.

351
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,129
Answer them, George.

352
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,964
Answer them.

353
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,301
Yes, I had issues with them.

354
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,220
But, that doesn't mean that I killed them.

355
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,681
All of them have other enemies too.

356
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,433
Why have the tables turned on me?

357
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:33,268
Stop lying.

358
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:36,938
All this time
I've been looking for the suspect,

359
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,981
and it turns out, it's you.

360
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,651
The murderer is in front of me.

361
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:43,779
Dad, I'm innocent.

362
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:46,239
You almost fooled us all.

363
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,908
You're pretending that you're grieving,

364
00:22:47,991 --> 00:22:49,826
but it's you who killed my son.

365
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,703
Sir, please calm down.

366
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,581
We're not yet sure
if Mrs. Palacios is indeed the killer.

367
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:56,625
We just want to clarify
by asking some questions.

368
00:22:58,376 --> 00:23:00,087
It's better if you come with us
to the police station.

369
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,297
We'll get your statement.

370
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:06,426
I will make sure you rot in jail.

371
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:09,805
You will pay for what you did
to my son, my grandson,

372
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,932
and all of your victims.

373
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,601
Go ahead, arrest her.

374
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:19,064
Amando, what are
the investigators doing here again?

375
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:22,109
They have some important news, madam.

376
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,485
So, where are they?

377
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,487
Maybe they are in Sir Galvan's house.

378
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,367
Where the hell is my phone?

379
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,827
I don't know, madam.

380
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:34,162
I think I left it in my office.

381
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,999
I will get it, madam.

382
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,965
What is Ms. Vivian doing here?

383
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:46,925
Amando.

384
00:23:49,678 --> 00:23:52,139
This is between me and that skank.

385
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:12,033
Don't you dare touch me.

386
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:14,035
I will not go with you.

387
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:17,038
My conscience is clean.

388
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:18,832
I am not the killer.

389
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,543
I'm just here quietly.
Why are you turning the tables on me?

390
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,757
Rebecca, please help me.

391
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:29,843
Call Mother and Ward, please.

392
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:31,178
Okay.

393
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:34,514
Ma'am, we're not arresting you.

394
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,516
We just want to ask you questions.

395
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:40,437
I am not going with you without my lawyer.

396
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:43,023
I'm being quiet here and you're making me
look like the bad guy.

397
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:46,151
Even if you call all your lawyer friends,

398
00:24:46,234 --> 00:24:49,779
you will not escape the wrath
of my justice.

399
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,747
Hello, Iñigo? Please help me.

400
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:01,082
Sergeant Royales and his men
are harassing me.

401
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:03,752
We are not harassing you.
Where did that come from?

402
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,379
Please, help me.

403
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,384
Ask your lawyer to follow you
to the police station.

404
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,261
- Just come with us.
- No.

405
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,722
Don't touch me. I won't go with you.

406
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:53,385
If the Palacioses think

407
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,971
that they have a hold on me
for the rest of my life,

408
00:25:58,181 --> 00:25:59,557
they are wrong.

409
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:03,019
I am smart even if I didn't graduate.

410
00:26:04,854 --> 00:26:10,610
I will find out
what your secret is, Aurora Palacios.

411
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:14,197
So, I will have a hold on you.

412
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:28,086
George, I couldn't find Auntie Ruth,

413
00:26:28,169 --> 00:26:29,796
so I asked Rico

414
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:31,172
to find them…

415
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:33,925
Mrs. Palacios, what's happening?

416
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,845
My stomach is aching.

417
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:43,184
George, why are you bleeding?

418
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,020
What?

419
00:26:58,616 --> 00:27:00,994
I see blood in your hands.

420
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,420
Knock, knock.

421
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,801
Aurora?

422
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:20,013
You're supposed to say “Who's there?”

423
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:23,558
Who's there?

424
00:27:23,641 --> 00:27:26,686
The person who is going
to kill you, Vivian.

425
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:28,605
Your angel of death.

426
00:27:36,154 --> 00:27:37,947
Aurora, put that down.

427
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,741
That can kill.

428
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,744
I'm fully aware of that, Vivian.

429
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:44,954
That's why I chose this.

430
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:47,749
It only takes one bullet

431
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,251
to kill an unwanted visitor.

432
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,879
Just one bullet, Vivian.

433
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:55,006
Why are you bleeding?

434
00:27:56,007 --> 00:27:57,092
I don't know.

435
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:58,176
What kind of drama is this again?

436
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:01,471
Arrest that woman
and take her to the police station.

437
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,723
- Now.
- Stop it.

438
00:28:03,807 --> 00:28:05,725
Have mercy on George.

439
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,396
And you, detectives,
can we just postpone her interview?

440
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,189
She will not escape from you.

441
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:14,067
I just need to take her to the hospital.

442
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,610
We'll go with you.

443
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:19,739
Let's go. Let's go.

444
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,241
Gosh.

445
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,215
Aurora, I told you. Put it down.

446
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:38,299
That can kill.

447
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,551
- Put that down.
- Why?

448
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,471
Isn't this what you're looking for?

449
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:47,976
You're so interested in finding out

450
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:50,812
what's inside my office.

451
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,106
Now, here's your answer.

452
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:58,653
Aren't you glad that you saw this?

453
00:28:59,446 --> 00:29:01,656
Didn't you leave, Aurora?

454
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,117
Where did you come from? Why are you here?

455
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,702
Magic.

456
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:12,459
Did you really think
you could outsmart me?

457
00:29:13,209 --> 00:29:15,962
I did not become Aurora Palacios

458
00:29:16,045 --> 00:29:19,966
to be outsmarted by a Vivian…

459
00:29:20,675 --> 00:29:23,094
whatever your last name is.

460
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,056
Oh yeah, it's Trano.

461
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,021
Aurora, just let me go

462
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:35,106
and I promise you
I will never go back to your place.

463
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,150
I will never go up to your place.

464
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:38,151
I will never enter your house again.

465
00:29:38,234 --> 00:29:39,611
- No. No. No.
- Have mercy, please.

466
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,070
- Sorry. I'm really sorry.
- No, Vivian.

467
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:44,574
- Sorry, sorry.
- You are not leaving.

468
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,075
- Sorry.
- Remember?

469
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,786
We had an agreement?

470
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,997
Galvan is looking for me.

471
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,416
He is looking for me.

472
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,962
If I saw you cross my path
on this estate again,

473
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,423
what did I tell you again, Vivian?

474
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:03,092
You can no longer go back to your house.

475
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,606
Don't come near me, Aurora.

476
00:30:16,689 --> 00:30:17,732
Don't come near me, Aurora.

477
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,734
I will shoot this.

478
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,486
Vivian!

479
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,821
Don't come near me, Aurora.

480
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:23,988
I'm telling you.

481
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,740
Don't come near me.

482
00:30:25,824 --> 00:30:27,534
Go down. I will shoot this.

483
00:30:27,617 --> 00:30:28,701
Go down.

484
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:30,453
I'm telling you. Don't come up.

485
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,704
I will shoot you with this.

486
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,164
Oh, God. Ma'am.

487
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,582
- Ma'am, don't hurt us.
- Don't come near me.

488
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:37,794
- My boyfriend will still marry me, please.
- Don't come up or I will shoot.

489
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,088
- Don't come near me.
- Cairo.

490
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,298
- Cairo, call Sir Galvan. Hurry up.
- I will shoot.

491
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,009
- Hurry up.
- Go down. Go down.

492
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,637
I will kill you. I will shoot this.

493
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,639
Don't come near me. Go down.

494
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,599
- Give me back my gun, Vivian.
- Go down.

495
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,725
Come here.

496
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:55,353
Ma'am Aurora.

497
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,939
Give me back my gun.

498
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,066
Don't come near me, Aurora.

499
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:01,985
Don't come near me. I will shoot this.

500
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,653
Go ahead.

501
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:06,114
Shoot me.

502
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,286
Sir Galvan, come with me.

503
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:13,079
Why?

504
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:15,748
It's Ma'am Vivian. She's running
amok in Ma'am Aurora's house.

505
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:17,333
What?

506
00:31:27,385 --> 00:31:29,262
Don't, Ms. Vivian.

507
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,931
Don't hurt Ma'am Aurora.

508
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:33,641
Just shoot me instead.

509
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:34,559
Just hurt me instead.

510
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,186
Oh, please. Amando.

511
00:31:37,270 --> 00:31:38,605
Don't be a hero.

512
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,025
Let Vivian do what she wants.

513
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,569
Don't come near me.
I said don't come near me.

514
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,778
Don't, Ms. Vivian.

515
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,947
You'll go to jail.

516
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:50,742
- Don't!
- Ma'am!

517
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,790
What happened?

518
00:31:58,708 --> 00:32:00,293
Oh, Vivian. Dear.

519
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:06,841
It only takes one bullet to kill a person.

520
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:10,178
I only put one bullet in there,

521
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:13,056
but it went off earlier, remember?

522
00:32:13,139 --> 00:32:16,017
So, there's no bullet anymore.

523
00:32:16,726 --> 00:32:18,853
That shotgun you're holding

524
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:22,565
is just as useless as this umbrella.

525
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,988
In fact…

526
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:34,827
this umbrella might even be deadlier.

527
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,330
Don't.

528
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,337
Aurora.

529
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,383
Let her go.

530
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:49,884
Galvan…

531
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,512
Hello, Sarge.

532
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:55,139
Mrs. Palacios has been transferred
to her room.

533
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,393
Yes, sir. I will update you.

534
00:32:58,476 --> 00:32:59,394
Okay.

535
00:33:00,061 --> 00:33:01,104
- Santos?
- Yes, sir.

536
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,606
Keep an eye on Mrs. Palacios.

537
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:06,234
Don't let her leave without us knowing.

538
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:09,612
Sir, she's so weak.
She can't escape anymore.

539
00:33:09,696 --> 00:33:12,740
Just do as I say.

540
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:14,158
That's better than us
getting outsmarted in the end.

541
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,328
Just go, I'll take care of things here.

542
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:21,874
Ms. Rebecca, have you messaged
Ms. Georgina's family yet?

543
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:24,460
Yes, I've texted them already,
but they're not replying.

544
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,628
Eduardo, just be brave.

545
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,546
Nurse, hurry.

546
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,631
My husband is having
a hard time breathing. Hurry.

547
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,471
This looks familiar.

548
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,640
I feel…

549
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,101
I think I've been here before.

550
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,699
When was that?

551
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,535
Ma'am…

552
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,662
It's you.

553
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,122
How are you?

554
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,498
How are the twins?

555
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:04,208
Twins?

556
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:06,919
I'll take care of her.

557
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,254
This will not happen again.

558
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:10,298
I will handle this.

559
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:17,930
Aurora…

560
00:34:19,098 --> 00:34:20,183
are you all right?

561
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,734
Let's go, Galvan.

562
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:32,278
Come on. Your sister is crazy. Let's go.

563
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:35,031
Galvan, let's go.

564
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:37,283
Your sister is crazy. Let's go.

565
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,743
Let's go.

566
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:40,369
Let's go. Aurora is crazy.

567
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,579
Aurora is crazy.

568
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:42,997
She's crazy.

569
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:44,916
The people here are crazy.

570
00:34:44,999 --> 00:34:46,292
Crazy. Let's go.

571
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,087
- Are you okay, madam?
- Let's go.

572
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,094
Twins? What twins?

573
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,512
Excuse me.

574
00:34:57,595 --> 00:34:59,347
Do you know each other?

575
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,724
You don't remember me anymore?

576
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:06,187
Oh, I'm so sorry, Miss.
But I don't remember you.

577
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:10,775
Were you my nurse here before?

578
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:13,778
<i>Code Blue. Code Blue. Emergency room.</i>

579
00:35:13,861 --> 00:35:15,988
Ma'am, excuse me. It's a Code Blue.

580
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:16,989
I'll get back to you.

581
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,418
Rico…

582
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,254
Rico, come up here.

583
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:32,797
Stand up there.

584
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:34,924
Are we fencing, ma'am?

585
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:37,802
I'll join you.

586
00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:43,975
<i>The evidence we gathered is not enough</i>

587
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,103
to file a case against Samantha Palacios.

588
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:52,608
It's impossible that she pushed
Mr. Palacios.

589
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,193
<i>The shoe print of Ms. Samantha</i>

590
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:57,697
<i>stopped at 2.5 meters</i>
<i>at the edge of the cliff.</i>

591
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,575
<i>No matter how she pushes Mr. Palacios,</i>

592
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:02,493
<i>he doesn't fall off the cliff.</i>

593
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:03,828
I knew it.

594
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,206
I finally figured it out.

595
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,250
Madam…

596
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,711
What did you find out?

597
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:27,185
I want you to pack your things
and leave this house.

598
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,061
Get out of my house.

599
00:36:29,729 --> 00:36:31,230
What?

600
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,857
You're throwing me out?

601
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:35,818
What did you do to me earlier?

602
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,403
You defended me

603
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:39,447
and now you're throwing me out?

604
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,201
Maybe I shouldn't have defended you.

605
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,412
I should have let Aurora hurt you.

606
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,539
Probably you deserve it.

607
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:52,126
Didn't I tell you not to go
to Aurora's house?

608
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,461
But, you're stubborn.

609
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:54,629
You're so nosy.

610
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,923
What nosy?

611
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,134
Let me put it in a way you'll understand.

612
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,804
You're a gossipmonger,
you're loud, you have no manners.

613
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,056
You're so crass.

614
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,100
What? Crass?

615
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,602
If I am crass,

616
00:37:09,685 --> 00:37:11,729
you're a coward. You're a coward.

617
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:16,943
Why is Aurora running the company?

618
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,110
Why not you?

619
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:20,154
She's a woman and it should be you, right?

620
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,531
The reason you can't defend me from Aurora

621
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,242
is because you're scared of her.

622
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:25,326
You're the eldest.

623
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,161
You should be running the company.

624
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,455
But, what? It's Aurora

625
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,166
because you're a coward and weak.

626
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,210
Now you want our daughter

627
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:37,797
to become the future CEO.

628
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,756
Why?

629
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:40,508
Because that's your dream

630
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:42,551
that you can't do for yourself.

631
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,971
This has nothing to do with us.

632
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,806
Let me tell you

633
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:50,810
what you are in a language
that you will understand.

634
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,853
You are weak.

635
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:55,147
You are weak. You're such a weakling.

636
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,691
You are weak.

637
00:38:01,404 --> 00:38:03,239
How are you feeling, Mrs. Palacios?

638
00:38:06,158 --> 00:38:08,828
I'm a bit weak and dizzy.

639
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:12,039
Well, your blood chem results came in,

640
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,917
and luckily everything seems normal.

641
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,670
Maybe you were too stressed.
That's why you were bleeding.

642
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,089
Can I go home now?

643
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:22,800
Yes, you can.
I will just prescribe some medicines

644
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,218
and you need to drink them,

645
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:26,554
so that the baby
will have a stronger hold.

646
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,265
Baby?

647
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,059
Yes, your baby.

648
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:34,854
Didn't you know, Mrs. Palacios?

649
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,355
You're pregnant.

650
00:38:37,523 --> 00:38:38,941
Doc, I am not pregnant.

651
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,027
My fertility doctor told me

652
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:43,362
that it would be difficult
for me to have a baby.

653
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:45,990
Difficult, but not impossible.

654
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,492
You had spotting.
That's why you were bleeding.

655
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,953
No, Doc. That's not true.

656
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,621
Please tell me you're joking.

657
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,832
I'm not joking.

658
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,043
Nurse?

659
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:01,047
Look.

660
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:15,561
It says here
that you are ten weeks pregnant.

661
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:18,397
I'm pregnant?

662
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,490
Doc, can I keep this?

663
00:39:27,573 --> 00:39:28,991
Yeah, sure.

664
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:30,242
I'll go ahead.

665
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,369
Congratulations.

666
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:38,376
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Palacios,

667
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:42,338
but it will take a miracle
for you to bear a child.

668
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,549
- Hello, Mom?
<i>- Sam.</i>

669
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,343
You won't believe this.

670
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,054
What? Has the killer been caught?

671
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:50,971
<i>Even better.</i>

672
00:39:52,264 --> 00:39:55,226
I know now how Paco fell from the cliff.

673
00:39:58,062 --> 00:39:59,855
Sam, are you listening?

674
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,149
<i>Sam.</i>

675
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,154
How's the investigation with George?

676
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,740
If that woman is discharged
from the hospital,

677
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,117
arrest her right away.

678
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:12,410
Arrest her?

679
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:15,287
She's not yet a suspect, Mr. Palacios.

680
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,498
You are so slow.

681
00:40:18,332 --> 00:40:20,376
You're no different from Casas.

682
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:24,004
Or, maybe you're covering up
for George too?

683
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:25,881
Mr. Palacios.

684
00:40:25,965 --> 00:40:27,216
You have no respect.

685
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,260
If you're looking for a respect,

686
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,011
you have to respect me too.

687
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:35,516
Francis, the night I pushed Paco,

688
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:39,019
Basil was able to take a video
on his cellphone.

689
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:41,063
What?

690
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,858
NEXT EPISODE

691
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,151
Detective.

692
00:40:46,819 --> 00:40:48,904
What do you need, Ms. Aurora?

693
00:40:48,988 --> 00:40:51,866
I want you to reopen Paco's case.

694
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,577
He didn't kill himself.

695
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,911
He was pushed.

696
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:58,038
It was Sam.

697
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:01,417
She used an umbrella
to push my son off the cliff.

698
00:41:03,377 --> 00:41:05,671
<i>Sam, your mother-in-law</i>
<i>wants to have you arrested.</i>

699
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,798
Sam, let's not take a gamble.

700
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,300
Let's just leave.

701
00:41:09,383 --> 00:41:12,553
Francis, do you think
we can leave this estate?

702
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,972
- Have you forgotten what Mom said?
- What is it, Sam?

703
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,766
That she'll have the guards
shoot us if we leave?

704
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,561
Well then, go ahead.
Let's see who shoots first.

705
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,687
Francis?

706
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,481
Oh, my God. Why do you have a gun?
