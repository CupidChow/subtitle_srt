1
00:00:14,973 --> 00:00:16,599
Mom, George is missing from her room.

2
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:18,143
I already searched the whole house

3
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,769
- but she's nowhere to be found.
- What?

4
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,980
<i>Where did she go?</i>

5
00:00:22,063 --> 00:00:23,940
George? George.

6
00:00:24,023 --> 00:00:26,985
PREVIOUSLY

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:29,654
George, are you okay?

8
00:00:29,738 --> 00:00:31,114
George, talk to us.

9
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:32,365
Talk to me.

10
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,783
Come here, my dear.

11
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,577
What did you do to George?

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,078
- Sir Galvan, don't. Please.
- Don't.

13
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:37,996
- Sir Galvan, don't.
- Don't.

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,581
She killed my grandson

15
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,708
and now she is trying to hurt George.

16
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:42,917
Sam saved her.

17
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:44,377
Ask Ando.

18
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,378
That's true, sir.

19
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:48,131
<i>Next time Barbara comes here,</i>

20
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,883
<i>inform me right away.</i>

21
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:50,800
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

22
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>You're so shameless, right?</i>

23
00:00:53,595 --> 00:00:57,599
You try to comfort George
after you killed her baby?

24
00:00:57,682 --> 00:00:58,641
Grief faker.

25
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,061
Such a wolf in sheep's clothing.

26
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,687
Hey, you're really getting on my nerves.

27
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:04,606
And I don't want to see your face

28
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,399
because you are cheap.

29
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:07,942
Well, then close your eyes.

30
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:09,444
You are rude.

31
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,905
That's for what you did to my mother.

32
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:16,576
Don't try to use your bitchy ways on me

33
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:18,495
because if you're a witch, I'm worse.

34
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,664
If you're a monster, I can be one too.

35
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:24,667
<i>Be thankful I can still be human.</i>

36
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:28,213
Forgive me because I failed
to protect you.

37
00:01:28,296 --> 00:01:31,382
<i>You will see your daddy in heaven.</i>

38
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,177
<i>Hug him for me, okay?</i>

39
00:01:35,136 --> 00:01:36,304
<i>I love you so much.</i>

40
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,394
Thank you.

41
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,735
My condolences, Galvan.

42
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,278
Thank you, Aurora.

43
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,656
George…

44
00:02:01,454 --> 00:02:02,372
Galvan…

45
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:06,209
Did you know
that Samantha wants to come here?

46
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:24,727
There they are.

47
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,365
What are you doing here?

48
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,369
The killer has no right to sympathize

49
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,871
with the person she killed.

50
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:25,997
Get out of here, Sam.

51
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,749
Auntie Ruth, I'm begging you.

52
00:03:27,832 --> 00:03:29,834
Even if we just stay here.

53
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:30,877
We'll just stay here.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:31,836
Sam!

55
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,505
Can't you understand?

56
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:36,758
Don't you ever go near George.

57
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:38,927
I don't want her to see your face.

58
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:42,138
You will only see each other in court.

59
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,681
That's enough.

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,517
I don't want any fighting,.

61
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:47,602
I don't want trouble.

62
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,354
I don't want to sue anymore.

63
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:51,564
What? No, George.

64
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:54,317
I won't allow that woman
not to be held accountable.

65
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,571
If you don't want to,
I will pursue the case.

66
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:00,573
And then what?

67
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,743
Will that bring back my baby?

68
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,870
Let's finish this memorial.

69
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,247
It's embarrassing to Father.

70
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:09,457
- But…
- Dad, please.

71
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:12,043
I've already made up my mind.

72
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,127
My mind is a mess,

73
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:14,837
I don't want to add to it.

74
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:20,969
I just want to be able
to mourn my baby's death properly.

75
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:24,347
Fine.

76
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,308
But, we're not done talking yet.

77
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,562
And you, leave!

78
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:46,995
George…

79
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:58,256
Sam, it looks like George
will finally forgive you.

80
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,175
Don't cry anymore.

81
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,096
Ma'am Sam, someone wants you to have this.

82
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:37,128
DIG DEEPER, I THINK AURORA
AND YOUR FATHER HAD A CHILD.

83
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,343
Did you see who left this?

84
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:47,346
A driver handed it over
at the main gate. I didn't see it.

85
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,392
Sam, where are you going?

86
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:55,188
Did you see who left this?

87
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:57,523
Did you see the license number?
What type of car?

88
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,983
No, ma'am.

89
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:01,486
A driver handed it over at the main gate.

90
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,571
You did not take note of it?

91
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:07,116
He just handed the letter
and the flower to me,

92
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,243
and then he left in a hurry.

93
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:10,995
Let's just check the CCTV,

94
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,289
so we can find out the license number.

95
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:47,198
So, what's the latest with Leonor?

96
00:06:48,324 --> 00:06:52,370
Do you know that she has a new boyfriend?

97
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:53,788
A drug lord.

98
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:55,832
- No way.
- Yes…

99
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,685
Ma'am, here it is.
It has been forwarded to me.

100
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:17,812
Play it.

101
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:24,694
Ma'am, that's the car
that left the flower.

102
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,238
Can you see the license number?

103
00:07:27,321 --> 00:07:29,073
- Can we zoom in?
- Yes.

104
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,326
Wait, I'll take a picture.

105
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:33,369
Here it is.

106
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,920
The reunion for our sorority
is coming up soon.

107
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,839
I have to book a flight to Singapore,

108
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:46,632
so I can talk to my designer.

109
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:47,842
Are you going?

110
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,052
To the sorority reunion?

111
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,930
- Yes.
- Darling, Barry.

112
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:56,350
I was, still am, and will always be

113
00:07:56,434 --> 00:08:01,522
the best NPU Lambda Epsilon Alpha

114
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:04,233
sorority grand sister.

115
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,652
My presence is always anticipated,

116
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,279
and you know that.

117
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,617
Did I ever miss our annual reunion?

118
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,702
Yes.

119
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,953
Sam…

120
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,456
I've been searching
for you for some time now.

121
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,874
What's happening?

122
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,461
Mother, remember the woman
who went to Francis' wake,

123
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,545
the one with the letter?

124
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,590
Yes, about the gas mask
in Aurora's basement.

125
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,717
She left a clue again.

126
00:08:30,468 --> 00:08:31,427
What clue?

127
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,055
It's about Dad.

128
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,058
I think it was…

129
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,102
I think 1994.

130
00:08:40,937 --> 00:08:44,023
You were gone for a year.

131
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,777
You know, I think some people
think that you died.

132
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,861
Gosh, Auro.

133
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,488
I got so worried about you.

134
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:57,286
I went to Europe that year
for a sabbatical year.

135
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:59,121
Yeah, I remember.

136
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:02,917
But, I also remember when you got back,

137
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,877
you gained a lot of weight.

138
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,379
You looked like you had gaven birth.

139
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:09,757
There is something I need
to know about Dad.

140
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,051
I'll probably wait for the next letter.

141
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,931
Thank you. Let's go, Mother.

142
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,266
All right, ma'am.

143
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,772
Auro, please be honest with me.

144
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,484
What really happened to you in Europe?

145
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:31,195
Why were you gone for a year,

146
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,531
and when you got back here

147
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,908
you were so fat?

148
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,285
What happened?

149
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,830
Shut up, Barry.

150
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,165
Respect the dead.

151
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,167
Stop gossiping around.

152
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:46,294
God.

153
00:10:20,536 --> 00:10:24,790
George, about what you told me earlier,

154
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,000
tell me it was a joke.

155
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:29,420
That was true, Dad.

156
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,589
I don't want to sue Sam anymore.

157
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,134
What did your contact say
in the transportation office?

158
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:37,136
They are overloaded right now.

159
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,013
They have heaps of work.

160
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:40,806
Whose license number was that?

161
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,267
The woman who went to the wake.

162
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:44,518
Do you remember that?

163
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,563
Sam, who was that?

164
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:49,106
I don't know,

165
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:51,108
but she's been looking at me
for some time now.

166
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:52,693
It seems she left something.

167
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:56,906
Why didn't you tell me right away?

168
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,665
Hello? Hello, Buddy.

169
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:08,084
Can you prioritize my request?

170
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:09,502
I really need the info.

171
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:11,962
Are you serious?

172
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:17,051
You won't avenge your baby?

173
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,552
What's happening to you?

174
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:22,473
I just had a realization, Dad.

175
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:25,184
What Sofia said struck me.

176
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,603
I will just accept what happened

177
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:29,021
because I don't want…

178
00:11:29,897 --> 00:11:31,899
I don't want to remember
the loss of my son

179
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:33,984
over and over again.

180
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,986
No, George.

181
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:39,615
If you won't push through with the case,

182
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,450
then I will do it.

183
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:43,160
No, Dad.

184
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:46,080
I will not cooperate.

185
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:50,334
I also attacked Sam. You and Mom too.

186
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,002
We all attacked her.

187
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:56,257
If I sue her, she'll just sue me back.

188
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,967
There will be a never-ending lawsuit.

189
00:11:58,050 --> 00:11:59,635
I don't want it anymore.

190
00:12:08,727 --> 00:12:10,521
Talk to your daughter.

191
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:24,076
Why did you ask for my help
and not Sergeant Royales?

192
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:28,956
Because this is about Mom Aurora and Dad.

193
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,500
And one more thing, Sergeant Royales

194
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:34,128
is already doing a lot of things.
I don't want to add to it.

195
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,090
And…

196
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,384
I'm just following the information.

197
00:12:40,468 --> 00:12:42,803
I don't know if it's really legit.

198
00:12:43,512 --> 00:12:47,600
Or if the mastermind
of the Palacios killer

199
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,187
is just using this
to divert you from the truth.

200
00:12:58,194 --> 00:12:59,695
George…

201
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,407
What's happening?

202
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,375
I made you all believe, right?

203
00:13:14,418 --> 00:13:17,546
So, I guess I made Sam believe

204
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,256
that I'll be able to forgive her.

205
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:25,137
But, the last clue that she gave

206
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,598
took us to the gas mask.

207
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,184
And now it's about Dad.

208
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:34,188
That woman knows a lot of things.

209
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,071
Here, my friend has already replied.

210
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,532
- I'll forward it to you.
- Okay.

211
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:46,951
Mom…

212
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:49,745
my anger towards Sam will never disappear

213
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:51,914
until I die.

214
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:57,795
Wait, George.

215
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,297
So, you're just fooling Sam?

216
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,216
You're playing with her?

217
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,929
You're making her believe
that you have forgiven her,

218
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,347
but you'll still
push through with the lawsuit?

219
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:13,435
There.

220
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:18,357
Boris Tayuman, lawyer.

221
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,193
A man?

222
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,030
Maybe that's her husband or son.

223
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,702
I will find out once I see that woman.

224
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:35,541
George, I really can't understand.

225
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,503
I will no longer sue Sam.

226
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,548
I will patch things up with her.

227
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:46,760
I will make her believe that we're okay.

228
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,387
I will win her over

229
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:51,849
and once I get her trust,

230
00:14:51,932 --> 00:14:54,643
it will be easier for me to get her baby

231
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,020
once she gives birth.

232
00:14:56,937 --> 00:15:00,024
Um, about…

233
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,567
you and Ma'am George…

234
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,155
Earlier I saw you call her

235
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:08,407
and she nodded.

236
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:11,410
It seems she is no longer mad.

237
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,705
I think, Ma'am Sam,

238
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,416
just a little push and she'll forgive you.

239
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,295
I hope so.

240
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:26,467
I'm thinking of Hong Kong…

241
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,596
No, Europe.

242
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,310
That's where I'll take
and raise Sam's baby…

243
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:39,104
My future child.

244
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,495
Come in.

245
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,003
Hi.

246
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:05,714
Mommy, how are you feeling?

247
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:08,008
I brought you your meds.

248
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:11,845
You're so sweet, Sofia.

249
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,180
Thank you.

250
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:16,850
Yeah, but I'm feeling better.

251
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,064
I think I heard…

252
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:26,819
your daddy shouting outside.

253
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:30,656
- Why?
- Dad is mad at George right now.

254
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,324
Thank you.

255
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,245
Ivan.

256
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,288
What's the update

257
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,748
on the car rental services
I asked you to check?

258
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,583
Yes, the team made progress.

259
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,712
On the list of the Palacios

260
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:46,130
that we checked,

261
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:47,965
there's one name that made a hit.

262
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:49,299
It's Ms. Trano.

263
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,719
Anyway, Mom. Take your meds, okay?

264
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,178
You've already eaten, right?

265
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,389
Yeah, I've already eaten.

266
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:57,433
Don't worry.

267
00:16:57,516 --> 00:16:59,018
I'll drink my meds, okay?

268
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:01,103
- Okay.
- Thank you, Sofia.

269
00:17:27,921 --> 00:17:29,506
There you are.

270
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,599
Miss Trano?

271
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,311
It's Vivian? Sir Galvan's girlfriend?

272
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,231
Yes, we've already checked
her driver's license

273
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,691
with the rent-a-car file.

274
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,984
And this is the result.

275
00:17:59,787 --> 00:18:00,746
It's her.

276
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:17,387
Well, hello there.

277
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,821
Have you secured the car she rented?

278
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:36,156
Did you check
if the tires match the tire marks

279
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,449
we saw at the crime scene?

280
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:39,868
The car is out of town.

281
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,745
A foreigner rented it.

282
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,749
Sarge, we need that car for investigation.

283
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,252
Take the necessary steps
so we can secure the car.

284
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,420
Wherever that car is, we need to go there.

285
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:51,755
Okay, Sarge.

286
00:18:57,636 --> 00:18:59,263
We meet again.

287
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:09,148
Things are so messed up here.

288
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,527
And it's a lot of fun.

289
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,034
Things are so messed up.

290
00:19:25,455 --> 00:19:28,667
And the war has just begun.

291
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:34,423
And it's all because of you.

292
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,216
Thank you. Thank you, sir.

293
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:43,932
Ma'am, the person you're
looking for lives here,

294
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,601
but he's not here.

295
00:19:46,476 --> 00:19:48,896
We need an appointment first
before we can talk to them.

296
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,941
Okay, let's just wait here first.

297
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,446
- Ando…
- Yes?

298
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:59,573
I hope no one finds out about this.

299
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:00,908
Yes, ma'am.

300
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,326
Thank you.

301
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:06,580
Yes, you.

302
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,378
Congratulations.

303
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,423
Good job.

304
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:36,401
That's the car.

305
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,861
Block the driveway.

306
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:46,912
That's it.

307
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,163
That's the license number.

308
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,583
- Don't back out.
- Yes, ma'am.

309
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,669
Let's wait for the person to go down.

310
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,076
Barbara Sagrado-Dee?

311
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,998
Whose car is this?
Why is it blocking the driveway?

312
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:36,211
Simon, what's this?

313
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,218
You?

314
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,220
Samantha?

315
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:50,183
You're the owner of this car?

316
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,063
You're the one who is helping us?

317
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,537
Miss?

318
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:15,667
I don't understand.

319
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,045
The nerve.

320
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,130
You're so shameless, right?

321
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:22,966
After you killed Georgina's baby,

322
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,885
you try to comfort her?

323
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:26,053
Grief faker.

324
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,139
Such a wolf in sheep's clothing.

325
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:31,016
You treat me and mother

326
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,851
so badly…

327
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,562
but it's you?

328
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,982
It's you who has been helping us.

329
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,110
- Simon?
- Ma'am.

330
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,322
Simon, how could you be so careless?

331
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:49,367
Now Samantha knows Sir Borris' car.

332
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,494
Ma'am Barbara, I'm sorry.

333
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,329
You're always saying sorry.

334
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:54,206
Go ahead and leave us.

335
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,586
I'm sorry.

336
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:03,715
That's just my front
so Aurora won't suspect.

337
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,176
If I've hurt you

338
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:10,055
or your mother, my apologies.

339
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:13,600
But I wanted it to look authentic.

340
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,313
But she's your best friend.

341
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:20,816
That's what I thought,

342
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,443
but I was wrong.

343
00:23:25,403 --> 00:23:26,822
Samantha, listen to me.

344
00:23:27,405 --> 00:23:29,324
Aurora is evil.

345
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:33,537
She is the reason why my husband died.

346
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,499
Why didn't you sue her?

347
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,377
Because I have no evidence against her.

348
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,422
But in the case of your father,

349
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:48,385
I can help you so you can find evidence.

350
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,804
And what do you want in return?

351
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:57,602
Justice for the deaths of our loved ones.

352
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:02,107
If Aurora goes to jail

353
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,484
for killing your father,

354
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:06,653
it will feel like justice

355
00:24:06,736 --> 00:24:08,446
has finally been served
for my husband's death.

356
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,579
The last clue you gave,

357
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:20,041
how sure are you that they have a child?

358
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,420
Well, 30 years ago,

359
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:28,008
Aurora was gone for a year.

360
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:30,802
She claims

361
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,846
she went to Europe.

362
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:35,974
1994?

363
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,352
No.

364
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:41,188
They weren't together.

365
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:43,315
I'm sure father was with us
during that time,

366
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,193
Sam, during that time I'm sure

367
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,070
she and Orly were seeing each other.

368
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,490
They were having an affair
for a long time?

369
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,576
Yes.

370
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:59,831
And I think they had a child.

371
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,001
What?

372
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,463
Just like I said earlier,

373
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:09,090
Auro went to Europe for a year…

374
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:13,178
Auro…

375
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:15,180
I'm sorry.

376
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:16,514
That's what I call her.

377
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:18,642
She's Auro and I'm Barry.

378
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,811
But anyway, as I was saying,

379
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:24,105
she went to Europe for a year,

380
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:26,316
and when she got back here,
she had gained a lot of weight.

381
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,027
So, I had a feeling she gave birth there.

382
00:25:30,862 --> 00:25:33,281
My God… Oh, my god.

383
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,826
And I have an idea who their child is.

384
00:25:37,827 --> 00:25:39,496
But up till now,

385
00:25:39,579 --> 00:25:43,375
she's still denying that they had a child.

386
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:49,547
If they had a child,

387
00:25:51,091 --> 00:25:54,094
how is this connected
to my father's death?

388
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,472
I don't know.

389
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,474
I really don't know.

390
00:25:59,557 --> 00:26:01,017
There might be a connection or not…

391
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:02,769
I don't know.

392
00:26:02,852 --> 00:26:04,896
That's why I wanted you to investigate,

393
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,316
so you can get more evidence.

394
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,444
So, who?

395
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:16,032
Who do you suspect

396
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,535
is the child of Mom Aurora and my father?

397
00:26:20,745 --> 00:26:25,834
Well, you have to look
for a certain birth certificate.

398
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:34,759
You're so good at creating trouble, right?

399
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,637
Yes.

400
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,476
It's payback time, Aurora.

401
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,938
Because tonight,

402
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,358
Mercy will die.

403
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:54,863
Mother!

404
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:03,830
You're so good,

405
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:06,333
even if…

406
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,127
sometimes…

407
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:14,924
things don't go according
to our original plan. But still…

408
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,762
it's better.

409
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:19,846
Mother!

410
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:23,808
Francis!

411
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:38,990
And Sam will accuse you.

412
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:42,410
You killed my brother.

413
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,204
What?

414
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,581
You wanted to run my mother over,

415
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,377
but Francis blocked the way
that's why he died.

416
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,381
The world war between
the two of you continues.

417
00:27:56,049 --> 00:27:58,843
Francis is stupid.

418
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,180
He's trying to be a hero.

419
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:04,766
Didn't he know…

420
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:07,811
that all heroes…

421
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:11,564
die?

422
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,358
<i>Why is the drama between</i>
<i>the Castillos and the Balays</i>

423
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,735
<i>"peace be with you"?</i>

424
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:17,445
<i>This is not acceptable.</i>

425
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:21,199
<i>Sam must accuse</i>

426
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:22,826
<i>one of the Balays.</i>

427
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,203
Ward, it's you?

428
00:28:25,286 --> 00:28:26,329
Sam…

429
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,667
It was you who ran Francis over?

430
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:36,965
What happened was better, right?

431
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:41,302
Because Sam

432
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:45,557
killed George's baby.

433
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,478
George.

434
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,355
What do you need?

435
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,482
Ma'am George's baby is gone.

436
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,568
What?

437
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,820
Great, right?

438
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,660
Okay…

439
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,373
I think you earned your rest.

440
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:17,422
So what now?

441
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,341
Rest first.

442
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:24,220
Until our next activity.

443
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,900
Rest well, my friend…

444
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:59,297
- Yeah?
- I left my phone here.

445
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,298
Okay.

446
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,134
What's that?

447
00:30:03,218 --> 00:30:04,677
- What?
- What's that box behind you?

448
00:30:04,761 --> 00:30:06,846
Nothing. It's nothing.

449
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,559
You're clearly hiding something from me.

450
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:15,188
It's a holiday gift.

451
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:20,109
My surprise for you
because it's the holidays, right?

452
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:24,489
Mom, you don't buy
holiday gifts this early.

453
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:25,406
Let me see that, come on.

454
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,742
No. It's a surprise, Sofia.

455
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:29,369
Don't ruin it.

456
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:30,829
No.

457
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,039
You're clearly hiding something from me.

458
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,083
- Let me see, Mom.
- No, I'm not!

459
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:37,377
It's a holiday gift.

460
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,128
Why is your reaction like that?

461
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,672
What's inside that box? Come on.

462
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:44,050
I said nothing, okay?

463
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,844
Now go. Out!

464
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,763
Okay.

465
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,014
Get out!

466
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,204
Hello…

467
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,833
I have Rebecca's birth certificate.

468
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,380
She was born in the South of France

469
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,800
and her last name is Castillo.

470
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,554
Her declared father was Dad.

471
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,810
It's her…

472
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,855
She's the daughter of Mom Aurora and Dad.

473
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,527
Rebecca is my sister.

474
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,401
Who's there?

475
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,787
Who's there?

476
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,716
- Mom!
- What?

477
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,187
George?

478
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:52,650
George?

479
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:07,081
No, no, no. Sofia, Sofia… No…

480
00:36:08,374 --> 00:36:10,168
Sofia, it's not what you think.

481
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,003
- So, I was right.
- No. No.

482
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:13,880
You were behind all of the killings.

483
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:16,507
No, no. Please.
What you're thinking is wrong.

484
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:17,592
Sofia, it's not that.

485
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:19,051
- No.
- No.

486
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,681
I came to talk to you, Sam.

487
00:36:24,849 --> 00:36:27,894
I saw you in a hurry
to go down to the basement.

488
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:29,729
That's why I followed you.

489
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,651
Do you need anything?

490
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,530
Sam, I want to patch things up with you.

491
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,408
I don't want it anymore, Sam.

492
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:46,746
I'm tired of our repeated fights.

493
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,956
It's tiring.

494
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,044
Give it to me. Give it to me!

495
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:55,087
- Mom.
- Give me that box.

496
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,297
No.

497
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,049
No! No! No!

498
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,384
You said that you wanted me

499
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,094
to be the only remaining
Palacios heir.

500
00:37:02,178 --> 00:37:04,263
- No.
- And now,

501
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:08,059
I find a gas mask in your things.

502
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,894
- Mom.
- Sofia. No, Sofia.

503
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:11,229
That's not mine.

504
00:37:11,312 --> 00:37:13,564
I don't know how
that got in my things. No.

505
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,982
When…

506
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,444
you approached me to patch things up,

507
00:37:19,987 --> 00:37:21,781
I should have listened to you.

508
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:25,076
I shouldn't have been stubborn.

509
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:28,412
George. George, wait.
Let's talk first, George.

510
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,332
George, I'm sorry.

511
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:39,674
If I had only talked to you at that time,

512
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:41,550
you wouldn't have…

513
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:45,346
you wouldn't have accidentally pushed me.

514
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,352
Frame-up. It must be a frame-up!

515
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:52,979
No, Sofia. Please, please.

516
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,355
- No. Give it, give it.
- I need…

517
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,356
Give me the box.

518
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,233
Mom, I need to tell Dad about this.

519
00:37:58,693 --> 00:38:01,696
No. No, Sofia. Sofia.

520
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,740
Sam, I was just in denial at that time.

521
00:38:05,449 --> 00:38:07,868
I know you didn't mean it.

522
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,495
It was me, Sam.

523
00:38:10,329 --> 00:38:12,373
It was my fault.

524
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:15,293
It was my fault I lost my baby.

525
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:16,460
George, George, George…

526
00:38:16,544 --> 00:38:19,088
George, don't say that.
Please, don't say that.

527
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:24,510
It's me. It was my fault.

528
00:38:26,929 --> 00:38:28,764
Sofia. Please, please.

529
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,600
Sofia. Please.

530
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,355
Sofia. Please, please, please.

531
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,816
Please, Sofia. Listen to me.

532
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,404
I'm innocent.

533
00:38:43,487 --> 00:38:46,699
What else will you tell me? Lies?

534
00:38:46,782 --> 00:38:48,534
I've caught you. You're the killer.

535
00:38:48,617 --> 00:38:50,202
- No.
- Or worse…

536
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:51,203
you're the mastermind.

537
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:54,248
No, Sofia. Please believe me. No.

538
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:58,377
I am not the killer, believe me.

539
00:38:58,461 --> 00:38:59,587
Okay, go ahead.

540
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,256
If you want to believe
that I'm the killer,

541
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,091
what can I do?

542
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:05,593
That's what you really believe.

543
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:10,264
But, do you really want
to report me to your father?

544
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,515
Even thought…

545
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:14,226
you don't really know the truth?

546
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:18,731
Even if I didn't mean it,

547
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,902
you still lost your baby because of me.

548
00:39:25,071 --> 00:39:26,781
How I wish…

549
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:29,658
How I wish I didn't force you
to talk to me at that time.

550
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,285
I should have…

551
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,996
I should have waited
for your anger towards me to subside.

552
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,375
I'm sorry.

553
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,502
Sofia, please.

554
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,836
I'm not the killer.

555
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,505
No. Please, please.

556
00:39:42,588 --> 00:39:44,215
No, please.

557
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:48,094
Ward and I are just the same.

558
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:50,346
Remember, Ward was framed too.

559
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,765
That's what has happened
to me now. I'm innocent,

560
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:53,974
Believe me.

561
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,769
I only saw the gas mask
in my things last night.

562
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,187
I have no idea how it happened.

563
00:39:58,270 --> 00:39:59,313
Sofia, please.

564
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,065
Believe me, my dear.

565
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,024
Mommy…

566
00:40:02,108 --> 00:40:03,192
What? Believe me.

567
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:05,486
Tell me you believe me.

568
00:40:05,569 --> 00:40:08,072
Why didn't you tell me right away?

569
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:12,034
Because I got scared.

570
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:13,994
I didn't know what to do.

571
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,705
I didn't know how
you were going to react, Sofia.

572
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,333
I got scared
that you might not believe me.

573
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,335
And look. That's what has happened.

574
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,629
You don't believe me.

575
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:25,339
Sofia, I'm not the killer.

576
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,591
- It's not me.
- Mommy…

577
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,137
George, forgive me.

578
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,973
Please forgive me.

579
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:38,978
I forgive you now.

580
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:43,023
Thank you.

581
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,776
Thank you…

582
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:58,372
Sofia…

583
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,291
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay.

584
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,960
I was just shocked.

585
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,213
But we need to tell Sergeant Royales

586
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,756
about the gas mask.

587
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,508
Like when George did.

588
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:11,886
We need to prove that
you were just framed up,

589
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,762
No, no, no.

590
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,848
They will not believe me, Sofia.

591
00:41:15,931 --> 00:41:18,350
They will not believe me, please.

592
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:20,311
Because…

593
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,354
the night when Francis got run over,

594
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:24,231
I was just here at home.

595
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:25,983
No one saw me.

596
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:27,693
I have no alibi.

597
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,779
You were Ward's alibi
because you were together in a motel.

598
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,574
But me, I was all alone here.

599
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:35,576
So, no one can prove that I was here.

600
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,870
And they are all mad at me here.

601
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:40,372
So please, don't tell them.

602
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,500
- Mom…
- No.

603
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:43,501
What are we going to do?

604
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:51,967
I don't know.

605
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,427
I don't know what to do.

606
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,554
But Sofia,

607
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:57,723
we need to dispose of the gas mask.

608
00:41:57,806 --> 00:41:59,725
How are we going to do that?

609
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,854
Aurora.

610
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,689
Let's put this in Aurora's things.

611
00:42:05,773 --> 00:42:07,399
What? Mom.

612
00:42:07,483 --> 00:42:09,068
You would frame her?

613
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,319
No.

614
00:42:10,402 --> 00:42:13,405
Sofia, you saw how

615
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:15,366
that woman insulted me.

616
00:42:15,449 --> 00:42:17,785
This is my chance to get back at her.

617
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,036
Let's put this in her things.

618
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,788
Mom, if that's your plan,

619
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:23,290
I will not help you.

620
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,376
If you don't want to, then don't.

621
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,485
I'm scared, Sofia.

622
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,487
<i>- Mom, just tell them the truth.</i>
<i>- I'm scared.</i>

623
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:55,990
<i>That's all you need to do.</i>

624
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,075
<i>Amando…</i>

625
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,952
For not protecting me from Galvan.

626
00:43:00,035 --> 00:43:01,787
NEXT EPISODE

627
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:03,414
You deserve that.

628
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:05,332
My OB is just near here.

629
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:07,626
She's available for me anytime.

630
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,420
<i>I'd love to help you.</i>

631
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:11,589
<i>I want to be a part of your journey</i>

632
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:12,840
<i>to becoming a mom.</i>

633
00:43:12,923 --> 00:43:14,758
I have a bigger revelation.

634
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:17,177
Rebecca is the daughter of Ma'am Aurora.

635
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:18,637
What did you say?

636
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:21,974
Is what the staff is saying true?

637
00:43:22,057 --> 00:43:24,351
Rebecca is the daughter
of Aurora and your father?

638
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,978
You will cover for your father?

639
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:27,062
Thank you, Kate.

640
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:29,064
I can now push through with my plan.

641
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:31,942
Plan? What plan?
