1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,890
I just turned my back, Galvan.

2
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,435
You already threw me under the bus.

3
00:00:18,518 --> 00:00:20,145
You did the same thing to me.

4
00:00:20,228 --> 00:00:22,105
You're not the enemy here.

5
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:25,400
It's both your daughters-in-law.
They are already allies.

6
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:28,278
We need to spy on Mom,
Aurora, and Uncle Galvan, George.

7
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,905
We need to know what their next move is.

8
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:32,741
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,451
Sam, hurry. We need to get closer

10
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:36,119
so we can hear
what they are talking about.

11
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:38,079
Not too close.

12
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:40,331
Sam!

13
00:00:43,293 --> 00:00:45,211
What's this? What's this doing here?

14
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:47,797
Someone placed that
inside your brother's cabinet.

15
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:50,216
He's being framed for Francis' death.

16
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,551
Mother, why do you have a grenade?

17
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:52,677
Where did that come from, Mother?

18
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,138
This is what I'll use on Aurora.

19
00:00:55,221 --> 00:00:56,264
Mother, Mother, Mother, please.

20
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:59,017
We need to surrender this
to Sergeant Royales.

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,643
They might sue your brother.

22
00:01:00,727 --> 00:01:02,395
Ward has no motive.

23
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:04,898
<i>A few days before Francis died,</i>

24
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,983
<i>we fought. We got into a fistfight.</i>

25
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,110
I will do the same thing
you did to my father!

26
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,820
I will kill you, Francis!

27
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,990
I will kill that woman.
I will blow her head off.

28
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,450
She's an animal.

29
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:17,827
I need you, Mother.

30
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,996
My baby needs you.

31
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,498
Your grandchild.

32
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:25,084
Mother, please. Put that down.

33
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,092
Ward… What's this mess
you've gotten yourself into?

34
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,054
George, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it.

35
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,472
George…

36
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,559
Don't scold your brother.

37
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,977
Let's find a way,

38
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,104
so he won't be sued.

39
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:51,486
Mom, I don't think we have a choice…

40
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:54,823
but to dispose of this gas mask.

41
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,491
What, how?

42
00:01:57,575 --> 00:02:00,453
Let's throw it in a faraway place.
Let's bury it, burn it.

43
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,704
I don't know.

44
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:17,470
- Ma'am.
- Mother, please.

45
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,473
Be careful, Ma'am.

46
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:22,100
Give it to me.

47
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:24,352
Give it to me, Ma'am.

48
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,563
- Please.
- Put it down, Ma'am.

49
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,157
Mother…

50
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,083
Mother, don't do that again, please.

51
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,252
My God.

52
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,087
I'm sorry, Sam.

53
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:55,425
I can't stop myself.

54
00:02:57,343 --> 00:02:59,929
It's so painful. It's really painful.

55
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:02,599
I know, Mother.

56
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,519
I am hurting too.

57
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,814
It's painful.

58
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:14,277
But Mother, I already lost Dad

59
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,362
and Francis too.

60
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,739
I don't know if I could make it

61
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,866
if I lost you, if I lost my baby.

62
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:20,950
I don't know.

63
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:22,952
I can't do it, Mother.

64
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,331
I can't.

65
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:30,126
Don't worry, Sam. I won't be gone.

66
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:32,128
Whatever happens,

67
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:35,548
we will be together.

68
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:39,135
We'll be together in fighting…

69
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,974
all the people who destroyed our family.

70
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,268
Promise me that, Mother.

71
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,980
Please, promise me.

72
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:52,315
I'm sorry, Sam.

73
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:53,900
I'm sorry. It hurts.

74
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,152
It hurts so much.

75
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:00,990
I will go to George.

76
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:04,577
I will talk to her about our plans.

77
00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:26,307
What, Aurora?

78
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,184
We've been going around here
for quite some time.

79
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,186
But up till now,
you still haven't thought of a way

80
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:33,314
to overcome the joint forces

81
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,025
of our daughters-in-law.

82
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,111
Come on, Galvan.

83
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,822
Please calm down.

84
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:44,701
Instead of you helping out in planning,

85
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:46,411
you're stressing me out.

86
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:48,246
Aurora, how can I calm down?

87
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:49,956
The moment those women's accusations

88
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:52,500
reach the media,

89
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,252
accusing us of being murder suspects,

90
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,964
the shares of Palacios Mining
will definitely go down.

91
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,465
No.

92
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,052
Do you think
I will let that happen, Galvan?

93
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,137
Of course not.

94
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,556
What's your plan?

95
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:11,728
Let's do what we did before

96
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,563
to José Beringuela.

97
00:05:14,981 --> 00:05:16,357
Another fall guy?

98
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,446
Come on, Ward.

99
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,489
Hurry up.

100
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:26,409
Go where we used to live.

101
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,745
Block seven is almost vacant.

102
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,080
It's safe there.
No one will notice you there, okay?

103
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,540
- Yes, Mom.
- George.

104
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,755
George, it's Sergeant Royales.

105
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:41,090
- Ms. Georgina, good evening.
- Just relax, Ward.

106
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,384
Don't be nervous.
They will suspect you more.

107
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,386
Relax, Ward. Just relax.

108
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,514
Aren't you scared of karma?

109
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:52,477
What are you scared of, Galvan?

110
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,105
Of karma or the downfall
of Palacios Minning?

111
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:00,902
So, who would it be this time?

112
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,322
Someone from the household.

113
00:06:05,156 --> 00:06:08,951
Someone despicable and wicked.

114
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,750
You still can't figure it out?

115
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:21,172
It's the woman who is so eager
to become a Palacios.

116
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,382
It's Vivian.

117
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:32,350
Sergeant Royales, whatever it is,

118
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,518
can we do it later?

119
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:36,145
We're in a hurry.
We need to go to the drugstore.

120
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,731
No problem. But before you leave,

121
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,858
can we talk to Edward?

122
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,152
Sarge, is there a problem?

123
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:45,488
My arthritis is hurting.

124
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,740
We need to buy medicine.

125
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:52,411
We just want to check
if the information we got

126
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,580
about Francis Castillo is true.

127
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,795
George, what are we going to do?

128
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:04,132
There's no reason for us to hide it.

129
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:06,676
Let's tell the truth.

130
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:09,387
Sergeant Royales can help us better.

131
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,639
George.

132
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,474
Mom.

133
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,642
It's okay. It's okay.

134
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:16,185
We're here.

135
00:07:21,315 --> 00:07:23,025
We're here. It's okay.

136
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,946
We'll ask Sergeant Royales for help.

137
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:39,417
Sergeant Royales,
are you looking for this?

138
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,712
Why do you have that?

139
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,381
Ward found it among his things.

140
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,301
Someone wants to frame him.

141
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:49,510
Yes.

142
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,973
Why do you have a gallon of gas?

143
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,726
Do you plan to burn that?

144
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,436
Sergeant Royales…

145
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:01,522
Ward is too young

146
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,692
to be accused of killing Francis.

147
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,736
Just because they found
the gas mask with him.

148
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:09,989
George.

149
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,827
Is it true?

150
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,134
Ward, was it you?

151
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,011
Sam…

152
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,349
It was you who ran Francis over.

153
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:45,566
No wonder Francis was worried.

154
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:50,154
Because it's true
that you hate him so much.

155
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,407
So you feel bad about Cairo
because he stopped Ward.

156
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,450
What do you want?

157
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,953
For him to beat you up from head to foot?

158
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,747
Sam, I've realized

159
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,583
that I've committed
a huge sin against him.

160
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,379
He lost his father
at a young age because of me.

161
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,463
That's why I don't blame him

162
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,757
for hating me so much.

163
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,928
Francis…

164
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,393
What happened to his father
was not our fault.

165
00:09:22,645 --> 00:09:24,772
Someday they'll understand that.

166
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,650
I hope so, Sam.

167
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,610
I hope Ward can forgive me

168
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,779
because he was so mad earlier.

169
00:09:32,613 --> 00:09:35,157
He threatened to seek revenge on me

170
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,951
and said he would kill me.

171
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:42,623
Until the end,
he wants you to forgive him.

172
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,044
Ward, are you that angry with him?

173
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:48,462
Sam.

174
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,631
To make him pay with his life?

175
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,091
Sam.

176
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,344
Why, Ward?

177
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,513
Why did you run Francis over?

178
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:02,977
Sam, no.

179
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,479
I am not talking to you, George.
It's Ward.

180
00:10:06,355 --> 00:10:08,357
Ward, tell me the truth.

181
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:12,778
Did you kill my brother?

182
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:22,413
Don't you agree with my choice, Galvan?

183
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,040
I mean…

184
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:27,960
our problems with the Palacios murders

185
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,879
will be solved.

186
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:33,549
And then, the biggest liability
in your life

187
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,887
will suddenly be gone.

188
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,264
I guess you're right.

189
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:44,310
Vivian is our best escape from this mess.

190
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,561
Good.

191
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,188
Let me make some calls

192
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:53,569
so we can make all our worries
go away like magic.

193
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,030
Unbelievable.

194
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:02,078
You siblings are so ruthless.

195
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:08,668
And now, you want to betray me.

196
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,753
Well, I'm sorry, Aurora.

197
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,757
Because you won't call anyone
to set me up.

198
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,387
Answer me. Come here.

199
00:11:19,470 --> 00:11:21,263
Tell me, is it you?

200
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,598
I'm begging you, tell me.

201
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,432
- Sam.
- Sam.

202
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,226
- Tell me the truth.
- Sam.

203
00:11:25,309 --> 00:11:27,311
- Is it you?
- You're hurting Ward.

204
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:29,522
- Ward, tell me.
- Sam!

205
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,232
I'm begging you.

206
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,608
Tell me the truth.

207
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:34,693
Sam, please.

208
00:11:34,777 --> 00:11:37,780
Vivian, are you spying on us?

209
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,033
Oh yes, Galvan, I am.

210
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,078
And just like,

211
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,955
what's that word you used?

212
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:48,040
magic,

213
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:53,045
I've recorded all your connivance.

214
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:58,342
So, before you think of betraying me,

215
00:11:58,968 --> 00:12:00,761
I will make sure

216
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:05,057
that you'll be the first to fall.

217
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,688
- Sam, please.
- Tell me.

218
00:12:10,771 --> 00:12:11,647
Ms. Samantha, that's enough.

219
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,233
- Sam. Sam, please stop.
- Ms. Samantha, enough.

220
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,485
You're hurting Ward.

221
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,820
- Stop it, that's enough.
- Sam, please.

222
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,905
- Ms. Samantha, stop it.
- Stop it.

223
00:12:20,698 --> 00:12:22,283
What are you doing to Sam?

224
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:25,035
Sam is hurting Ward. Look.

225
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,460
You two are so evil.

226
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,170
You're both ruthless.

227
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:35,421
You're both demons.

228
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,840
You're the cousins of Satan.

229
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:42,720
No wonder the Palacios killer
is killing you one by one.

230
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,930
He is eliminating your clan.

231
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:47,600
And you, Galvan,

232
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:50,186
I know you're irritated with me

233
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,188
because like what you said,

234
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:55,566
I'm a war freak, loud, meddlesome.

235
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,735
And I've accepted all the hurtful words

236
00:12:57,818 --> 00:12:58,903
from you.

237
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:04,742
But to set me up and make me a killer?

238
00:13:05,868 --> 00:13:09,872
At the most, I'm the mastermind.

239
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:12,166
Galvan.

240
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:15,336
Maybe you've forgotten.

241
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:18,547
I am still the mother of your child.

242
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,759
My God.

243
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:26,180
Vivian, spare us the theatrics.

244
00:13:26,263 --> 00:13:28,682
It doesn't suit you to be dramatic.

245
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:34,647
And please, next time you try to cry,

246
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,525
practice with real tears.

247
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,695
So you're convincing and realistic.

248
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:44,490
Hey, you woman. Don't piss me off.

249
00:13:47,034 --> 00:13:48,744
Sam, why are you hurting Ward?

250
00:13:48,827 --> 00:13:51,330
Mother, I just want to know the truth.

251
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:53,123
If he was the one who ran Francis over.

252
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:58,379
They found the mask
used by Francis' killer on him.

253
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,880
What?

254
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,555
- You?
- Auntie Mercy.

255
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,056
It was you who planned to run me over

256
00:14:09,139 --> 00:14:11,308
- and killed my youngest son?
- No.

257
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,269
- You fool! How dare you?
- No, it wasn't me.

258
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,104
- Fool.
- Auntie Mercy.

259
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:17,231
- You fool.
- Auntie Mercy.

260
00:14:17,314 --> 00:14:19,108
You fool.

261
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,860
Auntie Mercy, stop it.

262
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,987
Ouch. Ouch.

263
00:14:24,321 --> 00:14:26,615
You two are so ruthless.

264
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:28,075
That hurts.

265
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:29,243
What will you do?

266
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:33,080
I will call Sergeant Royales.

267
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:38,002
I will send him the videos

268
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:40,337
showing you two conniving.

269
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,092
So go ahead, Aurora, laugh some more,

270
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:47,595
because that's your last.

271
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,513
Stop that.

272
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:52,474
Over my dead body, Galvan. No.

273
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:55,477
Let her, Galvan.

274
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:57,771
Vivan, do you think

275
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:02,318
that will stand as evidence? No.

276
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,864
We can always say that's AI generated.

277
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:09,575
That it only copied
mine and Galvan's voices.

278
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:12,453
Oh, is that so?

279
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:16,081
Okay, change of plans.

280
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,042
I will do this instead.

281
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:21,045
I will upload this audio recording

282
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,588
of you conniving.

283
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:28,344
I will post this
on all social media platforms.

284
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:31,722
And of course, it will go viral.

285
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,142
If the gullible netizens
believe fake news,

286
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:39,271
what more this?

287
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,816
And if that happens,

288
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,819
I'm sure it will reach

289
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,698
the shareholders of Palacios Mining.

290
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:54,119
And when that happens… guess what?

291
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:58,749
The stocks of Palacios Mining will fall.

292
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,461
That's what you're scared of, right?

293
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,175
You fool. You fool.

294
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,095
Ward, tell me the truth.

295
00:16:11,178 --> 00:16:14,056
Did you kill my brother? Just say it.

296
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,893
Sam, Auntie Mercy, please stop it.

297
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,813
Please, have pity on Ward. He is innocent.

298
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,649
He didn't kill Francis.

299
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:29,488
Please listen to me, Sam and Auntie Mercy.

300
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:33,617
Ward didn't kill Francis.

301
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,828
- He didn't run him over.
- George!

302
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,954
He is innocent.

303
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,664
Stop speaking for your brother.

304
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,666
I am talking to Ward.

305
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,376
Ward, explain it to me.

306
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:44,336
Why do you have that mask?

307
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:48,424
Because someone framed him, Sam.

308
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:52,636
How can you even think
that my brother could do that?

309
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:56,473
And one more thing,
how could he run someone over

310
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:58,809
when he doesn't even know how to drive?

311
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,646
Sam, please.

312
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:04,857
Believe me.

313
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:06,900
Someone framed Ward.

314
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:10,279
Help me find out who that animal is.

315
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:13,657
Maybe he's the mastermind
that we are suspecting.

316
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:17,953
One of our in-laws

317
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:19,538
is behind all these killings, George.

318
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:23,751
Yes, but why? They are Palacios.

319
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,170
I don't know.

320
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,423
But one thing is for sure,
they are demons.

321
00:17:29,506 --> 00:17:33,552
They may be in connivance
or they may also have an accomplice.

322
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:35,512
Sam, we need to help each other.

323
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:39,141
We need to know
who the real mastermind is.

324
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:48,150
What happened?

325
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,568
Speechless?

326
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,155
Why are you speechless?

327
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:56,283
That's the problem with you.

328
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,452
You always look down on me.

329
00:17:58,535 --> 00:18:01,580
You thought I was stupid,

330
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:06,251
but you don't know
I'm intelligent and street-smart.

331
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:10,547
How much do you need, Vivian?

332
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:13,425
Five million? Ten? Twenty?

333
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:14,760
Fifty million?

334
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,345
Name your price.

335
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,555
Here we go.

336
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:20,015
There you go.

337
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,643
You really think
that I'm only after the money.

338
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:24,186
That I'm greedy for money.

339
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,730
Well, that's important for me.

340
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:30,484
But this time, that's not what I want.

341
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:36,323
I want you to make me your ally

342
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,617
- and not your enemy.
- God.

343
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,329
I can be a big help to both of you.

344
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,414
All right.

345
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,252
We'll make you an ally.

346
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,753
- No!
- Good.

347
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:53,757
Are you out of your mind, Galvan?

348
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,593
Aurora…

349
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:58,804
Vivian is right.

350
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,931
She can help us.

351
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,101
Exceptional decision, Galvan.

352
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,104
And you, Aurora,

353
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:09,731
stop contradicting.

354
00:19:09,815 --> 00:19:13,861
Because I'm sure I can really help you.

355
00:19:13,944 --> 00:19:17,156
I will be a big, big, help.

356
00:19:17,239 --> 00:19:18,782
I promise.

357
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:21,910
Okay.

358
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,081
Okay, Vivian.

359
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,749
All right.

360
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:33,630
Let's use your gossiping
and meddlesome ways.

361
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,341
Thank you.

362
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:40,095
I'm sure I can be a big help to you.

363
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,805
I promise.

364
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,766
You won't regret it. Promise.

365
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,896
Okay. I'll get to work right away.

366
00:20:04,786 --> 00:20:07,748
What? What's with the look?

367
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,209
Did you think I was serious?

368
00:20:12,502 --> 00:20:13,587
No.

369
00:20:14,504 --> 00:20:17,090
We will just use her.

370
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,592
And if she becomes useless,

371
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:22,930
then we will dispose of her.

372
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:25,432
Back to your old ways, Galvan.

373
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:32,272
Problems should be eliminated,
in whatever way.

374
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:40,489
Can I talk to Edward?

375
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:44,326
Ward,

376
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,411
Sergeant Royales,

377
00:20:46,495 --> 00:20:48,163
maybe you can talk to him tomorrow?

378
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:49,456
He is not well.

379
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,002
- Ward, let's go.
- Okay.

380
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,420
We'll be back first thing in the morning.

381
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:56,922
Let's go.

382
00:20:57,005 --> 00:20:57,839
Just relax, Ward.

383
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,841
Ward, relax. Ward.

384
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,761
Ward, please, breathe.

385
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,888
Please, Ward. Ward.

386
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,307
Ward.

387
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,559
Are you okay? Just a few more steps.

388
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,478
Just relax, please.

389
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,523
Breathe. Breathe, please.

390
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:32,666
Mom, where is Ward?

391
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,669
Sergeant Royales is on his way.

392
00:21:37,421 --> 00:21:38,297
Ward.

393
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:44,636
George, I don't want to go to jail.

394
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,097
George, I don't want… Mother…

395
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:49,516
- Mother.
- Ward.

396
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:51,893
You will not go to jail.
What are you talking about?

397
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:55,105
Yes, that's right, Ward.

398
00:21:55,188 --> 00:21:56,982
You're innocent.

399
00:21:57,065 --> 00:22:00,235
Whatever Sergeant Royales asks you,

400
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,653
just answer it.

401
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,739
That's it.

402
00:22:03,822 --> 00:22:06,700
Don't cry anymore.

403
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:08,243
Ward.

404
00:22:11,663 --> 00:22:12,748
Tell me the truth.

405
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,709
Is there something you're not telling us?

406
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,919
Why does it seem like you're so scared?

407
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,173
Are you hiding something from us?

408
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,762
Really, Sam?

409
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,680
You will help Ward?

410
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,140
Jericho.

411
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,518
Have you heard?

412
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:35,896
About Ward? Yes.

413
00:22:35,979 --> 00:22:37,481
That's what Cairo and I are talking about.

414
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,527
Help me find out who framed Ward.

415
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:44,529
It's not true that someone framed Ward.

416
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:47,282
What did you say?

417
00:22:49,659 --> 00:22:50,952
Ward, I'm asking you.

418
00:22:51,703 --> 00:22:52,954
George, come on.

419
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:56,166
Can't you see? Your brother is so scared.

420
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,668
No, Ma…

421
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,587
It seems there's something
he is not telling us.

422
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:04,800
Ward, why are you saying
you're scared to go to jail

423
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:06,635
if it's true that you're innocent?

424
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:09,679
What are you not telling us?

425
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:11,431
- Nothing, George.
- Ward.

426
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,477
- Ward, I heard the news.
- It's not true, Sofia.

427
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:18,438
This is a family matter. Get out of here.

428
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:21,108
- Get out. Get out.
- Ward.

429
00:23:24,319 --> 00:23:26,404
Sofia, wait.

430
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,327
Cairo.

431
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:35,872
Did you also see Ward?

432
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:38,500
Because I saw Ward

433
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:41,336
on the night Francis was run over.

434
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:43,922
He was in a hurry to leave the compound.

435
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,343
Remember? Mercy? Sam?

436
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,178
You went to church that night.

437
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:55,600
I think after 30 minutes,

438
00:23:55,684 --> 00:23:56,935
I saw Ward.

439
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:58,812
He was in a hurry to leave the compound.

440
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:02,065
Maybe he followed you to church

441
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,692
to wait for you.

442
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,695
Maybe Ward went somewhere else.

443
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,071
Or…

444
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:10,615
maybe he really went to church, right?

445
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,034
Come on, Sam.

446
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:14,786
There are a lot of witnesses

447
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,874
to Ward threatening Francis, right?

448
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,127
I will kill you!

449
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:23,879
- I will kill you, Francis!
- That's enough.

450
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,463
I will kill you!

451
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:29,134
But George said
Ward doesn't know how to drive.

452
00:24:29,217 --> 00:24:30,802
That's what I was about to say,

453
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,762
but Ms. Vivian keeps on butting in.

454
00:24:33,471 --> 00:24:34,764
Ma'am Vivian.

455
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,391
Auntie Vivian, please.

456
00:24:39,311 --> 00:24:41,396
What Ms. George said is not true.

457
00:24:42,689 --> 00:24:44,232
Ward knows how to drive.

458
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:45,358
What?

459
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:48,695
Yes. I taught him how to drive.

460
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:53,742
Are you two hiding something? Answer me.

461
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,417
Well, George…

462
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,838
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

463
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,174
Is Edward available for an interview?

464
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:14,888
You're ready, right?

465
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,894
I'm ready now, Sarge.

466
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:22,479
Let's go.

467
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,915
How many times
did you teach him how to drive?

468
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:43,041
Can he drive already?

469
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:44,668
Maybe…

470
00:25:44,751 --> 00:25:47,545
Maybe about five times.

471
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:48,880
Ward already knows how to drive.

472
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:52,259
Sometimes he gets the car from the garage

473
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:53,927
to go around the village.

474
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:58,556
Sometimes he and Sofia sneak out
with the car.

475
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,977
Ward drives Ms. Vivian's car.

476
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,187
Ma'am Vivian.

477
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,443
Here.

478
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,117
<i>You already know how to drive.</i>

479
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,285
<i>You can now drive on your own.</i>

480
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,246
<i>This is basic.</i>

481
00:26:21,329 --> 00:26:23,415
<i>If you want, we could even go to Baguio?</i>

482
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:24,749
<i>- What, Sofia?</i>
<i>- Let's go.</i>

483
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:26,459
<i>- Is it okay?</i>
<i>- Let's go.</i>

484
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,018
<i>Come on, I know this already, Cairo.</i>

485
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,394
<i>What's with you?</i>

486
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:45,729
<i>I have a good teacher.</i>

487
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:57,782
That's enough. Thank you.

488
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,618
Aurora. Galvan.

489
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:05,206
Oh, God.

490
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:07,834
And just when I thought my morning coffee

491
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:10,545
couldn't get any more bitter.

492
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:13,757
Your reaction is too much. Aurora, oh.

493
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,676
Are you that bitter with my presence?

494
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,304
Don't worry.

495
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,514
I'll make your day sweeter.

496
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,893
Vivian, what do you need?

497
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:27,479
It's Ward.

498
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,984
He's the one who ran Francis over.

499
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:38,698
A gas mask was seen in his things.

500
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,367
What?

501
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:43,203
What, Aurora?

502
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:48,541
Did your coffee become sweet
because of my update?

503
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:49,959
And that's not fake news.

504
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:57,884
George…

505
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,553
What's the problem?

506
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,058
Mom, I'm scared for Ward.

507
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:08,103
It seems there's something
he's not telling us. Him and Sofia.

508
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:09,354
Hold on.

509
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:11,314
Are you doubting your brother?

510
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,191
- Mom, it's not that.
- George!

511
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,192
But it seems he is not--

512
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,944
You're a liar!

513
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:17,946
What are you saying?

514
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:31,876
What now, Aurora?

515
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,797
Won't you even thank me?

516
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,465
Do you know what that means?

517
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:42,846
You're now acquitted of the accusation

518
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,432
that it was you or the person you hired

519
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,726
who ran over Francis.

520
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:52,230
And you heard that good news from me.

521
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,528
Wow.

522
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,321
Thank you, Vivian.

523
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,866
- You're good. You're so good.
- I know right.

524
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,367
I know.

525
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,286
Are you happy now?

526
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,290
Well, that will do.

527
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,501
And I told you

528
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:17,130
that I will be an asset to you.
I'd be a big help.

529
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,883
Well then, I'll go ahead.

530
00:29:19,966 --> 00:29:21,843
I'll try to get some more news.

531
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,095
The radar should always be up and running.

532
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:26,181
Okay, let's just update each other.

533
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,808
Oh, God.

534
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,440
Tell me, Aurora.

535
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,861
Did you put that mask
on that boy's possession

536
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:43,281
so you won't be the suspect anymore?

537
00:29:44,991 --> 00:29:46,785
Ward knows how to drive!

538
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,077
Where is he? Show him!

539
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:50,538
Ward! Ward!

540
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:54,042
Ward! Ward!

541
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,294
- Ward!
- Miss Samantha.

542
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,420
We're in the middle of an interview.

543
00:29:57,504 --> 00:29:58,963
What's the problem? Why are you screaming?

544
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,466
They are lying. Ward knows how to drive.

545
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,676
What, are you going to deny it?
Here's the video.

546
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,679
You borrow the car
from Cairo in the garage.

547
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:07,680
Look.

548
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:17,899
I wasn't able to tell Mother,

549
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,401
but yes, I know how to drive.

550
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,319
It was you?

551
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,155
It was you who ran over Francis?

552
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:26,115
Auntie Mercy, no.

553
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,201
Even if I die, I would not do that.

554
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,247
I promise. Someone is framing me.

555
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,665
Who, Edward?

556
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,250
Who do you think framed you?

557
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:43,758
Are we back at it again, Galvan?

558
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:46,094
Are we going to accuse each other again?

559
00:30:47,011 --> 00:30:48,888
We're just asking each other, Aurora.

560
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,099
We are allies.

561
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,936
We should help each other.
We need to protect each other.

562
00:30:57,522 --> 00:30:58,773
Remember?

563
00:31:00,650 --> 00:31:01,526
Fine.

564
00:31:02,151 --> 00:31:04,112
So, let me ask you this.

565
00:31:04,696 --> 00:31:08,616
Was it you who stole…

566
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,957
the gas masks
that we're missing from the secret room?

567
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:21,421
And you left one in Ward's things

568
00:31:21,504 --> 00:31:22,589
to frame him?

569
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:26,175
I have nothing to do
with the stolen gas masks.

570
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:31,306
The gas mask
that was found in my possession…

571
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,100
Like I said, I found it…

572
00:31:36,477 --> 00:31:37,604
in the estate.

573
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,941
So, my answer to your question is…

574
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,861
no.

575
00:31:45,528 --> 00:31:47,822
Same here then.

576
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,407
No, Galvan.

577
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,535
I didn't leave the gas mask

578
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,247
in the things of that poor street guy.

579
00:32:00,752 --> 00:32:02,503
I don't know. But if I knew,

580
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:04,964
I would've told you last night, right?

581
00:32:07,634 --> 00:32:10,553
Where were you
on the night Mr. Castillo was run over?

582
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,350
I was… in the village clubhouse.

583
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:16,893
Clubhouse?

584
00:32:16,976 --> 00:32:18,645
Do you have a witness or evidence

585
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,812
that you were there at that time?

586
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:25,401
I do. It's Mr. Arnel.

587
00:32:25,485 --> 00:32:28,321
He was the guard on duty
in the clubhouse that night.

588
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,282
We talked. He knows me.

589
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,992
He saw me crying

590
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,996
because I told him how sad I was
because George was missing.

591
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,957
That's right, Sarge.

592
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,876
He was so scared
when his sister was kidnapped.

593
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:45,713
Sergeant Tupaz, go verify his alibi.

594
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:46,756
Okay.

595
00:33:06,776 --> 00:33:08,152
Vivian sent a text.

596
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:10,989
To me too.

597
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:17,328
Thank you.

598
00:33:18,955 --> 00:33:21,874
Mr. Arnel, I'm Sergeant Alvin Tupaz.

599
00:33:21,958 --> 00:33:23,209
I'm sorry for disturbing you.

600
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,962
I'm sorry too
because my duty is scheduled for later.

601
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:28,798
We were told that you saw

602
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:30,800
this young man on Thursday last week.

603
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,304
He is Edward Balay.

604
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,515
He's with the Palacios.

605
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,532
Why are you looking at me with evil eyes?

606
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,784
You too. You're looking
at me in the same way.

607
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,661
Ma'am Ruth, Ma'am Mercy.

608
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:01,330
Stop that.

609
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,416
Let's just wait in silence.

610
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,084
You might end up fighting.

611
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:10,923
Yes.

612
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,010
Our families are starting
to patch things up.

613
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,388
I don't want us to fight again
just because of this.

614
00:34:17,972 --> 00:34:19,682
I am innocent.

615
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,893
And Mr. Arnel can prove that.

616
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:28,024
Sargent, when did you say it was again?

617
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,734
- Thursday.
- Thursday?

618
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:34,405
Ward didn't drop by
the clubhouse that day.

619
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,616
I think the last time he was here

620
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:38,367
was the week before.

621
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,704
But Edward said you saw each other

622
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:44,207
and he even told you
that his sister was kidnapped.

623
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:47,502
What? His sister was kidnapped?

624
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:50,379
You're a guard in this village,

625
00:34:50,463 --> 00:34:53,800
but you didn't know
that George Palacios was kidnapped.

626
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,094
There are a lot of people living here.

627
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:58,846
It's impossible for me
to know everything that's happening.

628
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:01,974
How's Ma'am George doing?

629
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:03,893
She's okay. She's been rescued.

630
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:06,813
Thank God.

631
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:08,773
But why is Ward saying

632
00:35:08,856 --> 00:35:11,317
that we talked even though we didn't?

633
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,111
He wasn't here at that time.

634
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,780
Can we check the CCTV?

635
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:18,908
Okay.

636
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:27,500
Sam, what are you doing here?

637
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,128
You're not part of the investigation.

638
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,504
I have a right to know

639
00:35:31,587 --> 00:35:33,131
if your brother is telling the truth

640
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:36,050
because it involves
the death of my brother.

641
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:55,027
Tupaz? What's the update?

642
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,946
Negative, Sarge.

643
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:59,615
Mr. Arnel didn't see or talk to Ward.

644
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:06,998
Did you check the CCTV?

645
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,749
Negative too.

646
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,585
No sighting of the subject.

647
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:11,711
<i>There's only one CCTV camera here</i>

648
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:13,754
that's been broken for a long time now.

649
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,672
The one in the lobby.

650
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:18,176
There! There, in the lobby.
That's where I spoke to him.

651
00:36:18,259 --> 00:36:20,511
Sarge, can I borrow your cellphone?

652
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:22,054
I'll just talk to Mr. Arnel.

653
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:24,891
Mr. Arnel, Ward will talk to you.

654
00:36:26,934 --> 00:36:28,186
I will put it on loudspeaker.

655
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:33,608
Mr. Arnel, why are you denying
that we talked?

656
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,860
Remember, we talked about George?

657
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,862
Ward…

658
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:40,406
we really didn't talk.

659
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,953
You're a liar, Mr. Arnel.

660
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,915
Liar. Liar!

661
00:36:48,998 --> 00:36:50,082
- Liar!
- It's you who is a liar.

662
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:52,585
You're a liar.
Why did you kill my brother?

663
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,088
Miss Samantha, Miss Samantha!

664
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,256
Let go of my son!

665
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,507
Let go of Ward!

666
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:02,386
That kid is problematic.

667
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,388
Why is he involving me in his problems?

668
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,391
Thanks for your cooperation, Mr. Arnel.

669
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,310
Thank you.

670
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,395
- Come here!
- Miss Samantha!

671
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:12,521
- Sam!
- Come here!

672
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,190
Sam! Sam, hold on.

673
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,942
Sam.

674
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,902
How dare you? Why did you kill my brother?

675
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:23,074
Sam, no!

676
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,326
No! No!

677
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,453
- I didn't kill--
- You fool!

678
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:28,829
Sam.

679
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:40,549
You're a liar! You're a liar!

680
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:42,718
You're a liar! You fool!

681
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:44,345
Why are you hurting my brother?

682
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:46,764
You're an animal. You're an animal.

683
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,557
You're an animal.

684
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,738
Yes, Boss.

685
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,199
Good thing you called me right away.

686
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,784
I was able to find a way

687
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:11,956
and destroy the CCTV camera in the lobby,

688
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,500
including the footage
in the storage device.

689
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:16,002
I erased it.

690
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,176
Thank you, Boss.

691
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:29,015
I'm just curious about
what you asked me to do, Boss.

692
00:38:42,236 --> 00:38:43,904
What's wrong with you, Sam?

693
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,282
Why do you immediately believe
that Ward is guilty?

694
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:48,617
- Because he is. He is guilty.
- Sam.

695
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,785
No, he's not.

696
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:51,662
Why won't you believe me?

697
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:53,831
What happened to the friendship
that we just built?

698
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,375
Your brother ruined it, George.
He ruined it.

699
00:38:57,418 --> 00:39:00,546
It wasn't Ward who killed Francis.

700
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,214
What's his motive for doing that?

701
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,425
Have you forgotten George?

702
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:07,094
He threatened my brother, George.

703
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:10,264
Not all threats are carried out.

704
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:12,641
Why are you assuming right away
that Ward is guilty?

705
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:14,185
Why are you so mad at him?

706
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:17,646
Okay.

707
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,149
Ward made a threat but you said

708
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:22,276
it was Auntie Mercy
who was supposed to be run over.

709
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,945
Francis only saved her, right?

710
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,032
So what's Francis' motive
to do that to Auntie Mercy?

711
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,799
I will sue Ward for murder.

712
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,967
We don't have evidence where Edward was

713
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:48,761
the night your brother was run over?

714
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,971
Ward, were you at the clubhouse
the whole night?

715
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,807
Ward, if this will save you

716
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,558
from the possible case
that they will file against you,

717
00:39:54,642 --> 00:39:55,726
then just go ahead and say it.

718
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:56,685
We went to the motel.

719
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:59,146
Sofia and Ward went to the motel

720
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,273
during the time Francis was run over.

721
00:40:01,357 --> 00:40:03,067
Why do you still not want to believe?

722
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,527
Because I know
that you're just covering for him.

723
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:05,986
Let this be a lesson to you.

724
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,530
You're protecting him.

725
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,198
- Mother! George!
- Who did this to you?

726
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:10,282
It's Cairo, George.

727
00:40:10,366 --> 00:40:12,201
Sam ordered him to do this to me.

728
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:15,121
It's official. You just lost
a friend. Again!

729
00:40:15,204 --> 00:40:16,163

00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,464
