1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,473
Why are you here? What are you doing?

2
00:00:15,557 --> 00:00:18,059
I'm looking for evidence
against your boss.

3
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:20,979
She insists that I killed Orly.

4
00:00:21,062 --> 00:00:22,063
<i>But isn't that right?</i>

5
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:24,357
Is your heart starting to beat?

6
00:00:24,441 --> 00:00:26,651
Mom, Basil just died.

7
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:28,653
I'm not ready to love someone else.

8
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:31,990
<i>I knew it. That jerk will seduce you.</i>

9
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,075
There's no problem if someone courts you,

10
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,202
but not Iñigo.

11
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:38,246
What's the problem with the both of you?

12
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:39,956
Iñigo is gay!

13
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:42,125
You're a demon. Animal.

14
00:00:43,042 --> 00:00:46,129
You will pay for what you did
to me and my children.

15
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:47,839
PREVIOUSLY

16
00:00:47,922 --> 00:00:49,007
What are you looking at?

17
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,301
Don't be too assuming.
I'm not looking at you.

18
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:52,218
We're looking for someone.

19
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:56,264
George, you took the keys from Bill.
Where are you going?

20
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,682
Dad, I just need to buy something.

21
00:00:57,766 --> 00:00:59,851
How about you?
Do you know where George is going?

22
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:01,770
I heard her talking
to Iñigo over the phone.

23
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,729
You fool.

24
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:04,606
- What? Come on.
- George, George…

25
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:05,607
Cairo, let go of me.

26
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,068
Ma'am Sam, Ma'am Aurora, and Ma'am Mercy

27
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:09,944
are fighting in the other house.

28
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:11,654
- Mother.
- Mother. Mother.

29
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,490
What now, Mercy?

30
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,617
Can you see the demon
that you're talking about?

31
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,368
- Aurora.
- You're crazy.

32
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,996
You're the one who is crazy.
You pushed my mother?

33
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,206
You tried kill her.

34
00:01:21,289 --> 00:01:23,083
It's your mother who started it.

35
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:26,169
Since you're up for discharge,
come with us to the police station.

36
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:31,382
Iñigo, good thing you're still here.

37
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,636
Ms. Georgina!
Stay away from Attorney Morales.

38
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:36,888
He is one of the Palacios killers.
He is Juliet's accomplice.

39
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:37,972
Don't come near us.

40
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,099
Iñigo…

41
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,393
Iñigo, let me go.

42
00:01:42,477 --> 00:01:44,437
Have pity on me and my baby.

43
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,855
I'm sorry, George. I can't do that.

44
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,190
Sergeant Royales.

45
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,191
Attorney Morales.

46
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,400
Sergeant Royales.

47
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:51,236
Sergeant Royales, help me.

48
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:53,071
Attorney Morales, let Georgina go.

49
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:55,073
Iñigo…

50
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,491
Attorney Morales, you'd better surrender.

51
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:57,700
Get inside.

52
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,202
- Iñigo…
- Get inside.

53
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,954
Get inside.

54
00:02:02,247 --> 00:02:04,165
Sergeant Royales.

55
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:06,209
Help!

56
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,378
Sergeant Royales.

57
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:09,754
The radio. Give me the radio.

58
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:12,715
Get our car. Hurry.

59
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,342
Base, emergency.

60
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:19,055
Suspect's vehicle, Black SUV, AAT 1200.

61
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:24,894
We will find her.

62
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,314
Ruth.

63
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:32,402
Where will George and Iñigo meet?

64
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:33,945
Sir Galvan, I don't know.

65
00:02:34,028 --> 00:02:36,531
She didn't mention that she's meeting him.

66
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:38,658
Your daughter is so hard-headed.

67
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:41,244
She's rude and has no manners.
She doesn't know how to respect people.

68
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:43,955
Yes, Sergeant Royales.

69
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,582
I will inform Sir Galvan.

70
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:55,008
Sir Galvan, Iñigo kidnapped George.

71
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,217
What?

72
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:03,725
Iñigo is Juliet's accomplice.
He is one of the Palacios killers.

73
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,226
Give me the phone.

74
00:03:07,604 --> 00:03:09,898
Hello, Sergeant Royales.

75
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:11,983
What the hell were you thinking?

76
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:14,068
Why didn't you tell me right away

77
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,863
that Iñigo is the Palacios Killer?

78
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:54,108
Where are we?

79
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:56,486
Why did you bring me here?

80
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:09,457
Why do you have a gun?

81
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,335
Will you kill me too
like what you and Juliet

82
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:14,337
did to Basil, Beverly, and Peter?

83
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,506
No, George.

84
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:22,929
I made some enemies in my line of work.

85
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,350
The reason I have a gun
is so I can protect myself.

86
00:04:28,017 --> 00:04:29,727
And no, George…

87
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:32,563
I am not the Palacios killer.

88
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:39,070
Juliet just reported me
to Sergeant Royales.

89
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,407
Sergeant Royales would not
have believed her

90
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:44,367
if she didn't show him
a piece of evidence.

91
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,077
George, believe me.

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,037
I have nothing to do with that.

93
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,956
I am not the Palacios killer.

94
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,126
I don't even know Juliet.

95
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:57,046
If that's true,
why is Sergeant Royales going after you?

96
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,465
Why are you trying to escape from them?

97
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:03,386
- And why is…
- I just said I'm not the Palacios killer.

98
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:12,437
No, Royales.

99
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,357
When that Juliet said
that Iñigo is her accomplice,

100
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:17,734
you should've informed us right away.

101
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,904
You're no different from Casas.
You're useless.

102
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,829
With all due respect, Sir Galvan,

103
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,123
it's not Sergeant Royales' obligation

104
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,417
to say everything that happens
in the investigation.

105
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,668
Especially if it's not verified yet.

106
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,545
Shut up.

107
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:40,173
I am not asking for your opinion.

108
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,008
No, you're not.

109
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,469
But, what you're doing
is not right either.

110
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,138
I hope we respect the people in authority.

111
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,765
I said shut up.

112
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,225
It's you who should shut up, Sir Galvan.

113
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,198
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:06,407 --> 00:06:08,451
I'm sorry I didn't mean to yell at you.

115
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,663
And you didn't mean
to point a knife at me earlier?

116
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,666
George, please believe me.

117
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,253
That Juliet is lying.

118
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:22,381
I have nothing to do
with the killing of the Palacios.

119
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:26,344
If that's true,
why don't you face Sergeant Royales?

120
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:30,473
You're a lawyer. You can defend yourself.

121
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,810
George…

122
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,312
I want to protect you

123
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:39,190
from Juliet's real accomplice

124
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:41,442
Do you understand?

125
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:45,196
Because they are definitely
looking for you by now.

126
00:06:46,114 --> 00:06:48,407
So, please George. Come with me.

127
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:50,827
I will protect you.

128
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:52,578
Please.

129
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,499
Did you just yell at me, Ruth?

130
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,000
Yes.

131
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:01,796
I yelled at you because you're annoying.

132
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,715
My daughter's life is in danger.

133
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:08,594
But instead of you helping out,
you blamed and insulted

134
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:11,472
the person who will help us.

135
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:16,477
Sir Galvan, we need Sergeant Royales.

136
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,189
What if he gets pissed off
and drops the case?

137
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,402
Who will save George and your grandchild?

138
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,405
Ruth…

139
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,617
Don't overreact.

140
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,662
It has already happened.

141
00:07:35,204 --> 00:07:37,123
Your daughter has already been kidnapped.

142
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:40,293
If it were Sofia who had been kidnapped,
what would you do?

143
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,170
That's right, Mommy.

144
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,422
You're being insensitive right now.

145
00:07:44,505 --> 00:07:45,590
Shut up.

146
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,391
Jericho…

147
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,104
Call Royales.

148
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,825
Sergeant Royales…

149
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,286
I'm sorry about what I said.

150
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm just worried for my grandchild.

151
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,790
<i>I understand, Sir Galvan.</i>

152
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,251
I'm begging you.

153
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,337
I will provide everything that you need.

154
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,881
Just bring them home safely.

155
00:08:29,217 --> 00:08:30,218
Thank you.

156
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,389
Thank you.

157
00:08:37,141 --> 00:08:38,643
Thank you so much.

158
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,291
Let go of me.

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,627
- Let go of me. Help!
- George. George.

160
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,129
Help! I will not go with you.

161
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,383
- George, no one can hear you here.
- Help! Help!

162
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:11,634
Help…

163
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,389
I'm so sorry.

164
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,688
Iñigo?

165
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:08,608
Yes, Attorney, there are witnesses.

166
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,694
A lot of people saw her push my mother.

167
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:13,696
Attorney, some people took videos too.

168
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,323
We will ask for copies.

169
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,955
You will sue me?

170
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,583
Are you for real?

171
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:30,713
My laptop.

172
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:39,347
Iñigo.

173
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,311
Iñigo.

174
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,481
Let me out of here.

175
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,155
Iñigo.

176
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:12,963
You're shameless.

177
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,173
- Francis.
- Why?

178
00:11:14,256 --> 00:11:15,174
Why?

179
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:19,303
I'm the one who should file
a case against your mother.

180
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,097
She attacked me in my room.

181
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,139
She didn't attack.

182
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,100
She was just going to talk to you.

183
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,062
Why? Is that what you will show in court?

184
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,107
Well…

185
00:11:31,941 --> 00:11:35,277
That's not what my CCTV footage is saying.

186
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:52,128
There you go. Look at her.

187
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,130
Look at Mercy. She's fuming.

188
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:58,551
It's obvious that she's planning
something bad against me.

189
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:03,222
And here's the other footage.

190
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,740
And this one.

191
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:49,059
You're such an animal, Iñigo.

192
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,354
Why did you lock me up here?

193
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,735
Let me go.

194
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,738
George…

195
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,491
You can't leave this place.

196
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,953
And I'm not locking you up.

197
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:12,958
I just want to protect you.

198
00:13:14,335 --> 00:13:17,922
If this is your way of protecting me,
don't bother.

199
00:13:18,672 --> 00:13:20,591
Just let me go, Iñigo.

200
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:22,134
Let me go.

201
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,053
Let me go.

202
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:27,681
Animal. Let me go.

203
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,352
I just defended myself

204
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:34,230
when your mother attacked me.

205
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,773
Just like what you said, Sam.

206
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,734
You just defended yourself

207
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,362
when my son, Paco, attacked you.

208
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:43,280
That's why you pushed him off the cliff.

209
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,827
Isn't it ironic?

210
00:13:49,328 --> 00:13:51,121
You keep on accusing me,

211
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,415
but we're just the same.

212
00:13:55,125 --> 00:14:00,339
We were defending ourselves
from our attackers.

213
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:05,010
Don't compare me to you.

214
00:14:05,094 --> 00:14:07,263
Because we're not the same.

215
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:11,725
Oh, yes we are, Samantha.

216
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,313
And you, Mercy…

217
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,607
You'd better be ready.

218
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,235
You will pay for what you did to me.

219
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:24,947
Why? What will you do?

220
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:33,706
Animal.

221
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:36,041
George, calm down. Please. Calm down.

222
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,334
I will only calm down
if you set me free me

223
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,086
from this place.

224
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:40,504
You're an animal.

225
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,715
Let me go.

226
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,058
I'm begging you, Iñigo.

227
00:14:55,436 --> 00:14:58,272
Please, set me free from this place.

228
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,380
Mother… Mother, don't be scared.

229
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,589
I am here.

230
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,800
She can't touch you as long as I am here.

231
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,760
Mother, we're here.

232
00:16:09,843 --> 00:16:11,845
I'm willing to kill
before she can get near you.

233
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:12,972
Thank you.

234
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:52,678
- Will you go hunting, Madam?
- Yes.

235
00:16:52,761 --> 00:16:53,971
What are you going to hunt?

236
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,560
Not what. But who.

237
00:16:59,643 --> 00:17:01,103
You will kill someone, Madam?

238
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:04,148
Yes. It's Mercy.

239
00:17:04,231 --> 00:17:08,360
I want that witch
to meet her maker in hell.

240
00:17:09,778 --> 00:17:10,654
Madam?

241
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,371
Ward…

242
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:21,582
Why are you here?

243
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,254
I don't want Mother to see me crying.

244
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:31,383
She might end up crying even more.

245
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:35,304
It's better if I just
get everything out here.

246
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,393
Ward, what happened?

247
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,065
Why are you crying?

248
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:53,363
It's George…

249
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,033
Iñigo kidnapped her.

250
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:58,660
What?

251
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,383
She hurt me, Amando.

252
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,427
You can sue her, Madam.

253
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,720
No.

254
00:18:18,347 --> 00:18:20,682
I want her out of my way.

255
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,643
If you do that, Madam…

256
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:24,353
Sam will get mad.

257
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,939
I don't care, Amando.

258
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,483
She's been mad at me for a long time,

259
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:32,236
and that's nothing new.

260
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:35,447
I'm used to people getting mad at me.

261
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,660
Do you want to go to jail
just because of Mercy, Madam?

262
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:42,871
Even if you kill her,
you'll end up at the losing end.

263
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:47,167
If you go to jail,
you will never see your grandchild.

264
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,801
Iñigo is one of the killers?

265
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,221
Sergeant Royales said,

266
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:03,559
Iñigo is seeking revenge, and also Juliet…

267
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:07,646
Because the Palacios
oppressed their family.

268
00:19:10,107 --> 00:19:12,359
Where is Auntie Ruth? How is she?

269
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:14,945
She's inside.

270
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,906
She couldn't stop crying.

271
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:24,163
I'm scared, Sam.

272
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:30,127
Iñigo might do something
to my sister and my nephew.

273
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,462
Ward, Ward, that's enough.

274
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,175
Your sister will be saved.

275
00:19:37,217 --> 00:19:38,260
We will go to the church.

276
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,179
We will pray for her.

277
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:43,557
Ward?

278
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:47,227
What are you doing to my son?

279
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,896
Mom, Sam is just talking to me

280
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,439
about George.

281
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,275
Is there an update on George?

282
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:55,152
Why are you interested?

283
00:19:56,153 --> 00:20:00,073
Do you want to know…
if Iñigo has already killed George?

284
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,257
Are you okay now, Madam?

285
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,221
I don't know, Amando.

286
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,559
But I still want to get rid of that Mercy.

287
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,778
Hey.

288
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,281
It seems my plan is working.

289
00:20:42,157 --> 00:20:43,784
They are now fighting.

290
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,748
Your evil in-law committed
a huge sin against you.

291
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,460
She didn't only steal your husband,
she killed him too.

292
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,172
So, she needs to pay, Mercy.

293
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,091
If I were you,

294
00:21:00,384 --> 00:21:01,927
I'd retaliate.

295
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,763
Attack that Aurora.

296
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:06,473
That's it.

297
00:21:07,182 --> 00:21:09,601
Go ahead and fight.

298
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,396
And kill each other's families.

299
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:14,982
So that my family
will be the only one left.

300
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:21,405
Madam, I will just ask Sam
to send Mercy back home.

301
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:25,909
But, Madam…
don't think of killing her anymore.

302
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,750
But, I can still think of hiring

303
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,213
someone to kill her, right Amando?

304
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:40,257
Madam…

305
00:21:43,510 --> 00:21:45,512
You're so gullible.

306
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:48,181
I'm just joking, Amando.

307
00:21:48,765 --> 00:21:50,058
What's with you?

308
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,476
My God.

309
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,520
Can't you take a joke?

310
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:09,453
Ruth, your daughter is in danger.

311
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:12,414
Forget about your anger. You need an ally.

312
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,584
I don't need your support,
you're all fake.

313
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,961
What's with you? Stop it. Mom, please.

314
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:18,962
No.

315
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,966
What's happening to George
is good news for them.

316
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,427
Because the truth is,

317
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:29,014
what they want
is for us to die one by one.

318
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,685
Let's go. Let's go, Ward.

319
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:39,751
George…

320
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,093
I brought you some dinner.

321
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,855
Help.

322
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,400
Help me.

323
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,152
George…

324
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,780
I already told you.

325
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,159
You can't leave this place.

326
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,163
This whole place is locked.

327
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,291
And you can't destroy that either.

328
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:22,961
Animal.

329
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,842
Help!

330
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,637
George.

331
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,851
What Sergeant Royales said is true.

332
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,354
I know Juliet.

333
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:47,235
Juliet Gamboa.

334
00:24:48,069 --> 00:24:48,987
What?

335
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,377
Mom… Sam was sincere earlier.

336
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,423
But what did you do?

337
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:10,508
You ignored her.

338
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,722
Mom, George is not by my side right now.

339
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:21,019
I need another older sister
who will comfort me.

340
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,065
Who will help me, Mom,
so I won't think of anything else.

341
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,194
So…

342
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,365
I can be strong for you.

343
00:25:33,990 --> 00:25:35,158
Ward…

344
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,870
we can be strong for each other.

345
00:25:38,954 --> 00:25:41,164
We don't need them.

346
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,835
Mom, we need them.

347
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,381
We need someone to support us.

348
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:54,135
We need someone to pray for George.

349
00:25:55,553 --> 00:25:58,515
We need them
whether they are the Castillos or not.

350
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:23,081
Juliet Gambao is an old client of mine.

351
00:26:24,624 --> 00:26:27,002
I wasn't able to help her because…

352
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:29,504
her pieces of evidence were not enough.

353
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,466
She took matters into her own hands,

354
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:37,053
and started killing the Palacios.

355
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:42,309
How did you know
that she was killing the Palacios?

356
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,114
When I went after her,

357
00:26:58,867 --> 00:26:59,951
She admitted it to me.

358
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:05,582
And she also admitted
that you're her next target.

359
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,251
I told her not to.

360
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,046
That's why she stabbed me.

361
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,008
Why me?

362
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,220
Because…

363
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:22,807
aside from the Palacios child
you're carrying,

364
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,480
she knows that I love you.

365
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:31,524
She also wants to seek revenge on me…

366
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,652
because I failed to help her before.

367
00:27:35,653 --> 00:27:37,572
The reason I brought you here…

368
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,949
is so she won't find you.

369
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,748
I'm sorry…

370
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:51,336
if I didn't believe you right away.

371
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:56,716
And thank you
because you wanted to protect me.

372
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,820
Is Iñigo courting you? Look, George.

373
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,322
There's no problem if someone courts you.

374
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,282
That's your life.

375
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,411
But, not Iñigo.

376
00:28:49,769 --> 00:28:50,812
I'm sorry.

377
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:53,857
I'm sorry.

378
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,985
Iñigo, I need to use the bathroom.

379
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,656
It's on the second floor, inside the room.

380
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,961
Is that a prayer list?

381
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,130
Do you still do that?

382
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,047
Let me see.

383
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,300
So I won't forget anything, Sam.

384
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:24,304
The number one on your list is my baby.

385
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:27,849
Of course, Sam.
He's my top priority right now.

386
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:31,019
Remember I told you.
I'm going to be the best uncle.

387
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:35,774
George is your number two.

388
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,787
How about you, Sam?
Who will you pray for first?

389
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,707
George.

390
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:00,548
Normally, you're my top one.

391
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,091
You and the baby.

392
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:06,805
But now…

393
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,725
I know George needs more prayers.

394
00:30:12,769 --> 00:30:15,146
Despite our fights,

395
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:19,234
she is still my friend.

396
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,403
I don't want something bad
to happen to her.

397
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:40,672
Sam?

398
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:45,927
Thank you.

399
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:54,185
I'm sorry.

400
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,772
Sorry for my actions earlier.

401
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:04,571
Maybe I was just scared…

402
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:06,656
and angry.

403
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:11,077
I was looking
for someone to take it out on.

404
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,123
And when I saw you,

405
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,626
I was even more angry…

406
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,882
and envious.

407
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,595
Because here you are, complete.

408
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:34,142
While our family is lacking.

409
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,022
I don't know if I will see George again.

410
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,537
There's no password.

411
00:32:49,634 --> 00:32:50,843
I'm sorry.

412
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,346
George…

413
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:55,348
George…

414
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,518
Sam…

415
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,105
Thank you so much…

416
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:05,274
Thank you for…

417
00:33:05,358 --> 00:33:07,485
worrying for George.

418
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:14,075
We understand you, Ruth.

419
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,619
I am also a mother.

420
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,082
And I understand you more.

421
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,003
And if I were in your shoes,

422
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:28,172
I would fight with a lot of people.

423
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:32,176
Don't think about it.

424
00:33:34,345 --> 00:33:37,348
No matter how many times
George and I fight,

425
00:33:38,725 --> 00:33:40,935
our friendship will not end.

426
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:48,067
And I can't stop worrying about her.

427
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,490
And I will not stop praying for her…

428
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:57,118
until she is safe.

429
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:01,539
Let's just believe that she'll come home.

430
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,278
George…

431
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:35,406
George…

432
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,951
George, please open the door.

433
00:34:45,958 --> 00:34:47,752
George, please open the door.

434
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,300
We'll go ahead.

435
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:56,177
Please update me.

436
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:01,849
Thank you, Mercy.

437
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:37,844
Wow… You've patched things up?

438
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:43,182
Hey, Ruth. maybe you've forgotten.

439
00:35:43,266 --> 00:35:45,643
You and the Castillos are enemies.

440
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,604
Don't believe them.

441
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:51,774
They're just faking it.

442
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:53,943
Just like you?

443
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,994
She's so unpleasant.

444
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:08,583
Good for you.

445
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:11,919
George…

446
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,298
Please open the door.

447
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,594
George…

448
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:23,514
Babe, once this is all over,
we'll be together.

449
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:26,559
I know, right? Stupid girl.

450
00:36:26,642 --> 00:36:29,437
How can I follow you
if I don't know your reason

451
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,897
or if it's even valid?

452
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,440
Iñigo is gay!

453
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:34,025
He seduced Basil.

454
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,736
George, open the door, please.

455
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,578
George…

456
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:01,761
Liar.

457
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,721
It's true that you and Basil
had an affair.

458
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,389
You fool.

459
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,808
You called him babe

460
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:09,685
and he called you babe too.

461
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:11,354
Animal.

462
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:13,147
You're a liar, Iñigo.

463
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,233
- Liar!
- Please, let me explain.

464
00:37:15,316 --> 00:37:19,487
No. I trusted you. But you lied to me.

465
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,947
Animal.

466
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,031
Are you gay?

467
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:24,951
I will accept whatever your answer is.

468
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,869
Just answer my question.

469
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,454
No.

470
00:37:29,455 --> 00:37:30,706
I'm not gay.

471
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:34,210
You're a liar. Liar!

472
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:36,420
Liar! Liar!

473
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:37,755
- George. George.
- You're a liar!

474
00:37:37,838 --> 00:37:39,173
Please let me explain, George.

475
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,800
George. George.

476
00:37:40,883 --> 00:37:42,301
George…

477
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,896
Sergeant Royales, what's happening?

478
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,356
Is there a lead yet?

479
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,942
For now, none.
But, the communication is ongoing.

480
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:00,319
If there's a lead,
it will be fed back here.

481
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:03,614
Currently, Sir, we are tracing
the car of Attorney Morales

482
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,741
on the streets with CCTV.

483
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:08,744
My men are coordinating
with several stations.

484
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,289
Thank you.

485
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:20,506
Is this the price
we have to pay in my desire

486
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:22,300
to have a luxurious life?

487
00:38:23,801 --> 00:38:25,845
I got what I wanted,

488
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:29,390
but problems keep coming again and again.

489
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,270
George has been in danger
several times already.

490
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:40,026
Our lives were better before.

491
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,111
It's simple,

492
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:46,449
but we didn't have problems like this.

493
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:53,581
It's time for your sister
to drink her vitamins.

494
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,250
I wonder how she's doing?

495
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,877
Has she eaten yet?

496
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,420
Mom…

497
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:01,839
It's you who hasn't eaten yet.

498
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,300
I can't eat.

499
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,756
George…

500
00:39:45,424 --> 00:39:47,551
George, wait. George.

501
00:40:14,662 --> 00:40:15,830
Jericho, why?

502
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,456
It's George.

503
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,084
If Iñigo is the Palacios killer,

504
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,086
could it be that he has already
killed George?

505
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,757
Jericho, please don't say that.

506
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,260
Iñigo won't kill George.

507
00:40:29,343 --> 00:40:31,679
Please, don't think that way.

508
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:33,973
I'm sorry, Ma'am Ruth.

509
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:39,854
Ward, Iñigo won't kill your sister, right?

510
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:41,647
Even if he is the Palacios killer,

511
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,109
he will not kill your sister, right.
Because he loves your sister.

512
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:47,695
Yes, Mom. Yes.

513
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:07,631
Why did you make me believe
that you loved me

514
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,009
if it's my husband you really love?

515
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,469
Sir, just a little more
and we'll be able to trace him.

516
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,220
I hope she gets home safe, Ruth.

517
00:41:13,304 --> 00:41:14,138
It's hard to lose a child.

518
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,015
Maybe Dad is right.

519
00:41:16,098 --> 00:41:17,892
You only extorted money from Basil.

520
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,518
George, we really loved each other.

521
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:20,895
Sarge, we got it.

522
00:41:20,978 --> 00:41:22,771
- Everybody, get ready.
- You're going with them?

523
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:23,689
What are you proud of?

524
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,608
His skills as a <i>tanod.</i>

525
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:27,985
George, I wanted to tell you,

526
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:29,153
but I got scared
that you might stay away from me.

527
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,279
I love you so much.

528
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,406
- I said stop it.
- He's a soldier.

529
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,824
- What?
- He's a scout ranger.

530
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:35,034
Team, split up.

531
00:41:35,117 --> 00:41:36,285
I want an update
on what I asked you to do.

532
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:37,161
Mother!

533
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:38,913
Do you have a suspect
for who ran her over?

534
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:41,582
It's my mother-in-law, Aurora Palacios.

535
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,042
Sergeant Royales? How is George?

536
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,252
She's already dead. She was shot.
