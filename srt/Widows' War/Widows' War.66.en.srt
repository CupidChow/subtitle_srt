1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,098
Give me back my child.

2
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:16,349
- You have no right.
- Order.

3
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,892
Stop it already, Rebecca.

4
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:19,561
You're not really healed yet.

5
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,397
Don't use my condition against me
because I'm already healed.

6
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,482
We already know where the children are,

7
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:27,944
and my client will be filing
a separate petition for habeas corpus.

8
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:30,196
Do everything you have to do

9
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:35,702
to stop what
that small Attorney's camp wants to do.

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:38,246
Sam started going into labor earlier.

11
00:00:38,329 --> 00:00:40,123
She could give birth anytime.

12
00:00:40,206 --> 00:00:41,041
<i>Do you think, Rebecca,</i>

13
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:44,085
that Aunt Aurora will keep her promise
to give you back the children?

14
00:00:44,169 --> 00:00:45,920
George, I think I'm leaking.

15
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,047
It's like there's something's leaking.

16
00:00:48,131 --> 00:00:49,299
But, don't worry.

17
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:52,343
I saw a nearby structure
that we can go to.

18
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:54,429
So that you and the baby
don't get too stressed,

19
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,890
forget about Auntie Aurora for now.

20
00:00:56,973 --> 00:00:58,183
‪PREVIOUSLY

21
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:00,769
Just happy thoughts, okay?

22
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,109
Sam… Sam…

23
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,864
So you don't think about the pain
and get her out of your mind,

24
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:15,408
just close your eyes.
Think of something else.

25
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:17,619
Focus on something else, okay?

26
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:20,789
Inhale, exhale.

27
00:01:20,872 --> 00:01:22,749
Inhale, exhale.

28
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,834
Take a deep breath. Just relax, okay?

29
00:01:26,294 --> 00:01:28,004
Relax.

30
00:01:28,087 --> 00:01:31,049
Inhale, exhale.

31
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:34,385
Inhale, exhale. That's right.

32
00:01:35,011 --> 00:01:37,305
Just relax, okay? Take a deep breath.

33
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:56,616
Inhale, exhale.

34
00:02:03,414 --> 00:02:06,501
<i>I've done so much wrong to you, George,</i>

35
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:11,172
<i>and it all started when I let</i>
<i>our friendship get involved</i>

36
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,883
<i>in a fight that had nothing to do with us.</i>

37
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,769
Get out.

38
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,189
You're such a flirt.

39
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:31,651
You're such a flirt.

40
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:34,362
- Get out.
- What's that?

41
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:37,407
Mother? What happened here?

42
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:40,994
It's your mother.
I caught her sleeping with my husband.

43
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,954
That's not true.

44
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:46,875
Your husband's body hasn't decomposed yet,
and here you are stealing my husband.

45
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:47,834
It's my husband.

46
00:02:47,917 --> 00:02:51,546
He forced me. Bert threatened me.

47
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,047
Wait a minute.

48
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:55,466
My mother told me she wasn't at fault.

49
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,801
Well, maybe…

50
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:59,929
Maybe it's your husband's fault?

51
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,140
Father, is that true?

52
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,895
Mercy wanted what happened to us.

53
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,563
I wouldn't have wanted it, but…

54
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,440
I'm just a man.

55
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:13,109
My mother is not a liar,

56
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:16,154
so I'm sure if something happened here,
you abused her.

57
00:03:16,237 --> 00:03:19,282
You raped her.
You're a rapist. I'll sue you.

58
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:22,160
Sis, watch your words.
My father is not a rapist.

59
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:24,704
Maybe it was really your mother
who approached my father

60
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:28,291
because, you know, she's mourning and sad.

61
00:03:28,374 --> 00:03:30,418
Wait a minute, George…

62
00:03:30,501 --> 00:03:33,046
George, the victim here is my mother.

63
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,047
Victim?

64
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,551
Isn't my mother the real victim here
because she and my father are married?

65
00:03:38,635 --> 00:03:40,386
They are in love.

66
00:03:41,012 --> 00:03:42,222
But, this old woman ruined it.

67
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,432
Wait a minute. Don't hurt my mother.

68
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,603
- That's enough.
- Then I'll hurt you instead.

69
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,452
George…

70
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,249
What are you doing here?

71
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,293
Do you want to make sure
that my father is dead already?

72
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,296
George, believe it or not…

73
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:19,634
I'm here to sympathize with you.

74
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,973
When my father died,
you were there to mourn with me.

75
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:28,685
Sam, this is my father's wake.

76
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:32,814
You are the ones to blame
for my father's death.

77
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,774
George, Uncle Bert had a heart attack.

78
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,694
- It's nobody's fault.
- It's because of you.

79
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:41,239
Nothing will happen
if we blame each other.

80
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:45,785
Actually, I'm here because…

81
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:50,999
I was hoping that our friendship
would be restored.

82
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,459
George…

83
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,339
whatever the misunderstanding
between our parents,

84
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,843
let's not let it affect us.

85
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,638
Should we just throw away
what we had together, George?

86
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,390
George…

87
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:10,643
It's a mess, Sam.

88
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,647
Father is gone already.

89
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,607
He is gone.

90
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,569
- George…
- Father is gone.

91
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:51,434
You're so shameless for coming here.

92
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,478
Do you want me to kill you too?

93
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,064
Really, George?

94
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:58,649
Are you going to patch things up
with this woman?

95
00:05:59,233 --> 00:06:03,654
Her family is the reason
your father is gone.

96
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:06,449
- Auntie…
- Get out. Get out.

97
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:10,369
Get out.

98
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,997
Get out.

99
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,876
Get out.

100
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,973
<i>And instead of making an effort,</i>

101
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,560
<i>I let us drift apart</i>
<i>because of our families.</i>

102
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:42,151
All the men who were close
to them are dying.

103
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,780
Poor Paco.

104
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,241
He was like father back then.

105
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,327
He died because of a Castillo too.

106
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,789
Not now, George.

107
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,083
My husband just died.

108
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,085
It was your fault…

109
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:01,838
because you killed him.

110
00:07:04,382 --> 00:07:05,883
- Hey.
- How dare you.

111
00:07:06,509 --> 00:07:07,927
George.

112
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,473
Let go of me.

113
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,561
I'll fight with you.

114
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,065
Let me go.

115
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,988
How dare you, no lifers

116
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:31,617
to turn this place of grieving
into a circus.

117
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:35,246
Don't you have respect for time and place?

118
00:07:35,913 --> 00:07:37,290
You have no manners.

119
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,503
My son is dead.

120
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:46,174
Someone killed him.

121
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:52,597
And then you're turning my house
into a market again.

122
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,894
What happened?

123
00:07:59,103 --> 00:08:00,062
- Huh?
- Oh, my God.

124
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,941
Mother, what happened to you?
Are you hurt?

125
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,109
What? What happened?

126
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,361
Ma'am, it's because…

127
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,865
- George…
- Sam.

128
00:08:12,241 --> 00:08:14,744
What did you do to my mother?
Come down here.

129
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:16,996
- It was just an accident.
- You don't want to come down?

130
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:20,249
If you're angry with me,
you should hurt me, not my mother.

131
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,419
You should fight me,
not my mother, not my family.

132
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,507
Talk to me, George.
Come here. What's your problem?

133
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:30,343
It's your mother. She's so meddlesome.

134
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,512
Instead of apologizing,
you're the angry one.

135
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,888
Why should I apologize?

136
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,141
How dare you.

137
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:43,105
- Your mother.
- Hey, ladies.

138
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:45,274
- Ma'am…
- Let me go.

139
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:47,026
It's your mother.

140
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,361
Tell your mother.

141
00:08:48,444 --> 00:08:50,112
Sam, wait. Sam.

142
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:51,405
That's enough, Sam.

143
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,366
Let me go.

144
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:08,506
<i>And when Basil blackmailed me</i>
<i>to kill you, I agreed out of fear.</i>

145
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,370
How dare you upstage me
at my own birthday party?

146
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:24,415
You really want to go to jail, don't you?

147
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,710
Don't release the video.

148
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,256
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

149
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,426
Because George…

150
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,095
is going to die tonight.

151
00:10:46,604 --> 00:10:47,605
Poison?

152
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:50,650
Make sure you do it properly this time.

153
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,029
<i>And even though</i>
<i>I didn't push through with my plan,</i>

154
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,283
<i>Basil and I still experienced karma.</i>

155
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,661
Why did you agree?

156
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:05,915
Samantha, answer.

157
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,376
Why did you agree to what Basil wanted?

158
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,837
Because he filmed what happened
on the cliff.

159
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:19,512
What video?

160
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,888
What cliff?

161
00:11:22,056 --> 00:11:25,935
Mother, I accidentally pushed Paco
off the cliff.

162
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,603
What?

163
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,193
Mother, I didn't mean to.
I didn't mean to.

164
00:11:35,111 --> 00:11:39,281
But, in the video…
it's like I did it on purpose.

165
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:45,538
That's why Basil is using that
to blackmail me to kill George.

166
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:47,832
Is that why you poisoned Basil?

167
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,542
Mother, no.

168
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,752
It wasn't me. I didn't kill Basil.

169
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:55,256
I don't know. I don't know who.

170
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:57,049
I don't know, but…

171
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:02,888
but I think its Francis' morphine
that they used to kill Basil, Mother.

172
00:12:02,972 --> 00:12:04,140
<i>Mother…</i>

173
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:17,111
Did you steal Francis' morphine?

174
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:20,531
You got your brother involved
in this mess you got yourself into?

175
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,576
You put your brother in danger.

176
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,287
You're the reason he went to jail.

177
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:29,665
You are the reason.

178
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:35,254
Mother, forgive me.

179
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,134
Forgive me. Forgive me.

180
00:12:43,137 --> 00:12:44,513
I will forgive you…

181
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,350
when you get your brother out of jail.

182
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:11,290
<i>I did everything I could</i>
<i>so Francis would be acquitted.</i>

183
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:15,336
<i>Even Beverly's appearance,</i>
<i>I used it against you.</i>

184
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,882
You again.

185
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:21,634
How did you get in here?

186
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,761
George, I'm not here to make a scene.

187
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,429
Sir Galvan and I will just talk.

188
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,264
You will do no such thing.

189
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:28,933
Guard.

190
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:30,559
Guard.

191
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,020
- My stomach…
- Guard.

192
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,523
Guard.

193
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:38,400
George, what's going on?

194
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:42,112
We have an unwanted guest, Mother.

195
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:47,326
Beverly?

196
00:13:48,911 --> 00:13:49,870
Do you know her?

197
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,288
But, of course.

198
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:55,251
She's our media relations officer
who resigned months ago.

199
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,670
Now we all know why you left.

200
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,171
Who's the father, Beverly?

201
00:14:02,758 --> 00:14:05,636
Do we know who the father
of the baby you're carrying is?

202
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,680
Is it someone from the company?

203
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,063
It's Basil.

204
00:14:21,193 --> 00:14:22,695
How did you know this?

205
00:14:24,071 --> 00:14:26,198
She told me and George last night.

206
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,449
Right, George?

207
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:32,413
She was claiming
to be Basil's former girlfriend.

208
00:14:35,624 --> 00:14:37,626
Basil has a mistress?

209
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,173
Beverly, is this true?

210
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,552
Did you have an affair with my son?

211
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:54,894
Go ahead, tell them
what you said to us last night.

212
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:56,228
- It's okay.
- Sam, please.

213
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,688
Don't meddle here.

214
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,274
Beverly, speak up.

215
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,194
I didn't intend
to reveal the truth this way,

216
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:07,281
but it's true.

217
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,327
Basil and I are in a relationship.

218
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,461
If it happened to me,

219
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,671
I'd be angry.

220
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:27,801
I mean, there's no sense of peace,
no diplomacy.

221
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:32,932
If it happened to me,
I would definitely make her pay.

222
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:35,893
Her?

223
00:15:36,894 --> 00:15:39,396
Do you think a woman did that to me?

224
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:43,525
George denies doing anything about that.

225
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:50,074
A piece of advice

226
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,369
from one pregnant woman to another…

227
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,790
Please protect yourself.

228
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,418
Protect your child.

229
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,047
It's difficult.

230
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,384
Is George barren?

231
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:14,974
Oh, my God…

232
00:16:16,892 --> 00:16:18,852
Don't tell me you don't know?

233
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,815
Beverly. Please, please.

234
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:25,567
Promise me you won't tell George.

235
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,529
I won't.

236
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,031
Now I understand.

237
00:16:32,032 --> 00:16:35,077
She can't have children.
That's why she's mad at me.

238
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,127
<i>I did all that against you.</i>

239
00:16:44,128 --> 00:16:46,213
<i>So, George, forgive me.</i>

240
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,382
Is George barren?

241
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,803
That's not true. Beverly is just lying.

242
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:56,890
Since when did I lie?

243
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:01,020
When I said Basil and I were going
to have a baby,

244
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:05,566
I was telling the truth,
and the DNA test confirmed it.

245
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:09,695
I may be a mistress, but I'm not a liar…

246
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,697
unlike you.

247
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:25,586
Both of you, let's discuss this privately.

248
00:17:26,336 --> 00:17:28,255
It's embarrassing for the guest.

249
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:32,342
It's more embarrassing for George
because she's lying to all of you.

250
00:17:32,426 --> 00:17:34,720
Shut up.

251
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,723
Your daughter is barren
and she can't give Basil a child.

252
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:39,266
You, shut up.

253
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,268
You don't know what you're talking about.

254
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:43,854
But I do, George. I do.

255
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,148
And that's the thing about the truth.

256
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:50,819
Let's go.

257
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:52,780
The rumor must be true…

258
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,536
that when Basil found out
that George couldn't give him a child,

259
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:02,122
he wanted to leave her…

260
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,168
That's why you killed him.

261
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,753
What?

262
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:13,008
Don't fight with her anymore. Come on.

263
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:14,593
Let's go first.

264
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:15,677
Come on.

265
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,893
George.

266
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:28,023
George, please listen to me.
Please, let go. George, please.

267
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:40,369
Beverly, are you okay?

268
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:41,870
- Yes.
- Do you want water?

269
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:43,330
What do you want?

270
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:44,957
Wow…

271
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:48,377
that's quite a scene she made there.

272
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:53,882
It seems like George
is more than capable of killing.

273
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,427
What do you think, Amando?

274
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,420
Sam…

275
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,630
Sam, you're fully dilated.

276
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:35,257
Are you ready?

277
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,259
Okay.

278
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,720
Inhale, exhale.

279
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:46,059
On the count of three, push.

280
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:49,646
Raise your head
until your chin touches your chest, okay?

281
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,693
Ready?

282
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,614
One, two, three. Push.

283
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,995
Push harder, Sam, okay?

284
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,622
One more time.

285
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,416
One, two, three. Push.

286
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,502
<i>Push harder, Sam. Push.</i>

287
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:14,838
<i>You can do it.</i>

288
00:20:17,716 --> 00:20:21,053
<i>I'm tired. I can't do it, George.</i>

289
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,890
What you are saying is not acceptable.

290
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:28,393
You have to keep pushing
until you deliver the baby.

291
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,396
If you stop, the baby might suffocate.

292
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,607
So, push. You can do it.

293
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,525
Push as hard as you can.

294
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:36,985
Okay, ready?

295
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:41,240
One, two, three. Push.

296
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,826
As hard as you can, Sam. Push hard as…

297
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,786
<i>Push.</i>

298
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:49,039
<i>Push.</i>

299
00:20:56,964 --> 00:21:00,467
George, if I don't survive,
you take care of my baby.

300
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:06,223
<i>Die if you must,</i>
<i>but not until you deliver my baby.</i>

301
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:10,394
Sam, you can't die and you must not die.

302
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:12,813
You will see your baby.

303
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:15,983
You will still watch everything
that will happen in his life.

304
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:19,278
So, you have to push the hardest, okay?

305
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,199
One, two, three… Push.

306
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:25,617
<i>Push. Sam.</i>

307
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,786
<i>As hard as you can, push.</i>

308
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:29,538
<i>Push.</i>

309
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,011
At last…

310
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,470
you're here.

311
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:52,537
<i>Thank you, Son. You didn't fail me.</i>

312
00:22:52,621 --> 00:22:55,874
<i>Just like what that woman did to me</i>
<i>again and again.</i>

313
00:22:55,957 --> 00:22:59,503
<i>That started when her family killed dad.</i>

314
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:12,057
- Bert?
- Dad.

315
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,311
Bert.

316
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:20,816
Dad. Dad.

317
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:23,485
- Dad. Dad.
- Bert.

318
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,569
Dad.

319
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:27,489
Bert. Bert. Bert.

320
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,033
Help. Help, please.

321
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:32,244
Call an ambulance.

322
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,663
- Dad.
- George! George.

323
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,705
George.

324
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,250
- George, what?
- Dad.

325
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,210
Bert. Bert.

326
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,921
Call an ambulance, please.

327
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:47,259
Ma'am, letter for Bert Balay.

328
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,261
He's already gone.

329
00:23:49,344 --> 00:23:51,763
Kindly receive this letter from the bank.

330
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:54,599
Just fill this in.

331
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:00,397
Thank you.

332
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,072
What's that, George?

333
00:24:09,156 --> 00:24:11,408
Did father make a loan in the bank?

334
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:13,952
I have no idea, George.

335
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,831
If we fail to pay,
they will be forced to take our house.

336
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:28,758
George, wait a second.

337
00:24:28,842 --> 00:24:30,844
Let's talk first. Don't leave me, please.

338
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:32,095
I'm begging you.

339
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,681
Please, George.

340
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:35,932
Wait.

341
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,226
George, talk to me.

342
00:24:40,604 --> 00:24:42,147
George, please.

343
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,816
Get down from there. Talk to me.

344
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,734
George.

345
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:57,078
I'm sorry…

346
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:59,414
I'm sorry, madam.

347
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,839
I'm so sorry.

348
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:24,439
I'm really sorry, Mrs. Palacios,

349
00:25:25,357 --> 00:25:28,318
but it would really take a miracle
for you to bear a child.

350
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:31,613
There's really nothing we can do.

351
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,168
George, where's my baby?

352
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:48,922
I want to embrace him. Can I have my baby?

353
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,133
Wait. I'm still cleaning him.

354
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:57,347
<i>No matter when you are</i>
<i>a nuisance in my life.</i>

355
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,350
<i>Just when I thought</i>
<i>I had recovered from you</i>

356
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:02,894
<i>after I married Basil Palacios,</i>

357
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:05,647
<i>you suddenly entered my life again.</i>

358
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:08,024
- This is Basil.
- Hi.

359
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,318
- He is my cousin.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

360
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,529
The eldest child of Uncle Galvan.

361
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,824
Paco told me that you had just
come back from your honeymoon.

362
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,951
- Yes.
- I'd love to meet your wife.

363
00:26:18,034 --> 00:26:19,452
- Where is she?
- Let me go and get her.

364
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:21,579
There she is.

365
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,123
- I'm here.
- Wife.

366
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:24,249
George?

367
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:30,964
<i>Since then, you didn't only</i>
<i>slowly destroy Basil and I,</i>

368
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,008
<i>you even tried to kill me.</i>

369
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,055
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

370
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,656
Sam, wait.

371
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,038
Where did you come from?

372
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,375
I almost got run over earlier.

373
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,626
Are you okay?

374
00:27:10,587 --> 00:27:12,714
Did you see who did it?

375
00:27:14,341 --> 00:27:16,551
<i>And when you failed to kill me,</i>

376
00:27:16,634 --> 00:27:20,305
<i>you attempted to pin Basil's poisoning</i>
<i>on me.</i>

377
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,441
Whose drawer is this, Ms. Georgina?

378
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,152
That's mine. Is Basil's cellphone there?

379
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,030
- No, but we found something else.
- What?

380
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,908
Morphine tablets.

381
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:43,161
Weren't these used to poison your husband?

382
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:49,626
What is that morphine tablet doing
in my drawer?

383
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:53,088
Well, that's my question to you.

384
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,466
What is morphine doing in your possession?

385
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:01,346
Mrs. Palacios…

386
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:04,891
why do you have morphine tablets
in your drawer?

387
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,268
I don't know. That's not mine.

388
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:13,691
Look, I wouldn't be that stupid
to let you see them if they were mine.

389
00:28:14,567 --> 00:28:16,528
Well, then how do you explain this?

390
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:20,031
Someone might be framing me.

391
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,535
Maybe it was Basil's killer
who placed that in my drawer.

392
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:27,580
<i>But when your brother had karma</i>
<i>because of the things you were doing,</i>

393
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,375
<i>you still picked on me.</i>

394
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:33,628
Why would I poison my own husband?

395
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:37,173
You were suspecting
that Basil has a mistress, right?

396
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,800
Maybe that's the reason you killed him.

397
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,760
Are you having an affair with my husband?

398
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,556
What?

399
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:47,809
Are you flirting with Basil?

400
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:51,229
Or, maybe he's about
to find out your secret

401
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,689
that you can't give him a child.

402
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,524
That's why you poisoned him.

403
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:56,359
I'm so sorry, love.

404
00:28:58,194 --> 00:29:00,905
I'm sorry I wasn't able
to give you a baby.

405
00:29:00,989 --> 00:29:04,284
But, you still promised me
the rest of your life.

406
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,705
How I wish you fulfilled
even half of that.

407
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:13,835
You fool.

408
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,005
Animal.

409
00:29:17,589 --> 00:29:19,758
Take back what you said.

410
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,178
Let go of me.

411
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:24,888
You're so shameless.

412
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,182
I didn't kill your husband.

413
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,726
My brother didn't kill
your husband either.

414
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:32,145
What's wrong with you?

415
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,813
Fool.

416
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,408
<i>I can forgive all that you did to me,</i>

417
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,913
<i>but to accuse my brother</i>
<i>and have him beaten up,</i>

418
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,207
<i>that's what I can't forgive.</i>

419
00:29:52,707 --> 00:29:54,417
I will just apologize to you.

420
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,461
No, Sam. You will only hurt me again.

421
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:57,962
- No, Ward. I will not hurt you.
- I don't want to.

422
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:59,047
- I don't want to.
- Wait.

423
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,385
- Mom. George.
- Ward, hold on.

424
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,805
- Ward, stand up. Come here.
- Why are you hurting my brother?

425
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:11,768
What did this woman do to you?

426
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,061
George…

427
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,233
Who did this?

428
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,986
It's Cairo, George.
Sam ordered him to do this to me.

429
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:26,866
<i>Because of your evil ways,</i>
<i>my baby died too.</i>

430
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:30,119
George, wait. Please, let's talk first.

431
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,705
George, I'm sorry.

432
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:37,043
What?

433
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:40,004
Is that a clear answer to your sorry?

434
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,297
Okay.

435
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:43,883
I deserve that.

436
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:48,346
But, don't think for a second
that you're the victim here, George.

437
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,140
We are the real victims here.

438
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,185
My brother died, George.

439
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:59,274
Can you blame me
when all the evidence is pointing at Ward?

440
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:02,318
You did the same thing to Francis.

441
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:03,611
You even had him jailed, remember?

442
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:05,488
Do you think
I have forgotten about that, George?

443
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:07,740
Take back what you said.

444
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,409
That's the truth, George.

445
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,286
- You're really a fool.
- What now?

446
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,788
- Take back what you said.
- George, let me go.

447
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:15,707
I said, take back what you said.

448
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:17,542
- Let go of me.
- You fool.

449
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:19,419
Let me go.

450
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,340
George…

451
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:26,509
George.

452
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:32,640
<i>That's why now that I'm holding your baby,</i>

453
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:38,146
<i>I will make sure to return</i>
<i>all the pain you caused me.</i>

454
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:47,739
George, my baby.

455
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:49,782
My baby.

456
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,786
Hold him first,

457
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,830
while I clean you.

458
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,207
My baby…

459
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,586
Oh, my God. My baby.

460
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,568
Maybe the reason he was born on Christmas

461
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:33,493
is because he has a gift for me.

462
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,456
Peace and harmony.

463
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,843
<i>Go ahead, Samantha.</i>

464
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,846
<i>Pour all the love you have for him.</i>

465
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:59,644
<i>Because after today,</i>
<i>you will never see or hold him again.</i>

466
00:33:04,023 --> 00:33:06,442
Who else did
the two Mrs. Palacioses talk to

467
00:33:08,027 --> 00:33:10,363
after 8:25 this morning?

468
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:28,381
No one else even through
text, online call, or chat?

469
00:33:28,881 --> 00:33:32,802
Sarge, it was Mom. George called her.

470
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:37,598
Mrs. Georgina called you?

471
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,271
Remember, George called you
around 10 a.m.?

472
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,733
Oh, yeah. That's right.

473
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:51,446
She said… we would eat out,

474
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,073
but she didn't text again.

475
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,908
I was so pissed off.

476
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:59,245
That's what I told Mercy… Right, Mercy?

477
00:34:00,955 --> 00:34:02,498
Did Ms. Georgina mention

478
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:06,210
what place or restaurant
she plans to dine in?

479
00:34:09,422 --> 00:34:10,631
Okay.

480
00:34:11,466 --> 00:34:13,634
I'll have her number pinned by the network

481
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:16,971
so we can trace where she was
when she called you,

482
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:19,348
so I can deploy
my search and rescue team right away.

483
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:26,105
Sarge, just tell me what area
so I can inform my colleagues.

484
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:28,149
Okay.

485
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,619
Sis, thank you.

486
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:44,040
Even if it was difficult,
you didn't give up.

487
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,586
Of course.

488
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:53,716
With our long wait for the baby,
would we give up at the end?

489
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,471
You helped me give birth.

490
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,976
You are his mother
as much as I am his mother.

491
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,906
Despite everything that happened to us,

492
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,159
I am happy…

493
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,329
because we remained friends.

494
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,669
You came here to taunt me.

495
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:33,422
- George, I am here to comfort you.
- No, Sam.

496
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:37,718
You came here
because you're looking for a fight.

497
00:35:37,802 --> 00:35:40,638
So come on, let's fight. I don't care.

498
00:35:40,721 --> 00:35:42,807
George, I know
what you're going through is painful

499
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,308
because you lost a husband

500
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,937
But, if you're looking
for a fight to grieve,

501
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:49,939
George, don't involve me. Please.

502
00:35:50,022 --> 00:35:51,983
- Don't turn your back on me.
- George, please.

503
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:53,234
I said don't…

504
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,902
Let go of me.

505
00:35:58,406 --> 00:35:59,907
- Come on.
- What now? Fight back.

506
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,620
I don't want to fight with you.

507
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,833
Go back to your husband.

508
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:12,295
Cry over him.

509
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,256
Embrace him.

510
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,260
This is the last time
you will be able to do that.

511
00:36:30,605 --> 00:36:33,191
What are you doing here?

512
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:37,945
The killer has no right
to sympathize with the deceased.

513
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,113
Get out of here, Sam.

514
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,865
Auntie Ruth, please. I'm begging you.

515
00:36:40,948 --> 00:36:42,950
Even if we just stay here.

516
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:43,993
We'll just stay here.

517
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:44,952
Sam.

518
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,205
Can't you understand?

519
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,874
Don't you dare go near George.

520
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:51,751
And I don't want her to see your face.

521
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:54,378
I don't want to fight any more.
I don't want any trouble.

522
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,214
I don't want any lawsuit.

523
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:58,299
What? No, George.

524
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:01,469
Let's end this memorial.
It's embarrassing to Father.

525
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,679
- But…
- Dad, please.

526
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:06,140
I've already made up my mind.

527
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,060
I'm so confused already.
I don't want to add to it.

528
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,191
I just want to be able
to mourn my baby's death properly.

529
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:18,653
Fine.

530
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:21,530
But, we're not yet done talking.

531
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,785
And you, leave.

532
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,209
George…

533
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:39,632
I'm sorry if I was forcing myself
on you before.

534
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:44,762
It was just that I didn't want
to give up on you.

535
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,642
I want you to know
how important you are to me.

<i>Go to sleep so my baby and I can leave.</i>

538
00:38:06,075 --> 00:38:09,537
I hope the Palacios killer did not kidnap
Ma'am George and Ma'am Sam.

539
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:11,289
I don't think they were kidnapped.

00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:25,678
Sarge, why are you looking
at me like that?

545
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:28,014
Maybe you know something
and you're not telling me.

546
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,850
Hi, baby Gilbert.

547
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:32,518
