1
00:01:05,982 --> 00:01:08,151
We have an unwanted guest, Mother.

2
00:01:08,234 --> 00:01:09,235
Beverly?

3
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,612
You know her?

4
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,616
She's our media relations officer
who resigned months ago.

5
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:16,993
Now we all know why you left.

6
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,495
Who's the father, Beverly?

7
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,705
It's Basil.

8
00:01:20,789 --> 00:01:23,541
I didn't intend to reveal
the truth this way,

9
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:26,419
but it's true.

10
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:30,006
<i>Ma, do you believe what Beverly said?</i>

11
00:01:30,089 --> 00:01:31,174
<i>Could it be</i>

12
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:35,303
that George has known for a long time
that Basil had a mistress,

13
00:01:35,386 --> 00:01:38,181
and that's the reason why
she killed her husband?

14
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,892
Is that the reason

15
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,437
why you exposed Beverly's secret?

16
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:50,235
To make us think that George
is a bitter, vengeful wife

17
00:01:50,318 --> 00:01:52,487
who killed her own husband.

18
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,822
Ma, Francis is innocent.

19
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,866
He had no reason to kill Basil.

20
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,538
If your brother is really innocent
like you're telling me he is,

21
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:02,997
he'll be acquitted, Sam.

22
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:06,334
Let the authorities handle this.

23
00:02:06,417 --> 00:02:07,752
PREVIOUSLY

24
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:08,878
Okay?

25
00:02:09,754 --> 00:02:13,049
This is called a non-invasive
prenatal paternity test.

26
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:16,010
<i>We have a 99.9% accuracy rate.</i>

27
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,178
<i>In less than a week,</i>

28
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:20,682
<i>we'll be able to confirm that</i>
<i>this woman is just fooling us.</i>

29
00:02:20,765 --> 00:02:22,851
Maybe I'm telling the truth.

30
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:25,812
The question is, can you handle the truth?

31
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:30,316
That Basil and I have a baby,
and, obviously, you don't.

32
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,818
What did you say?

33
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:33,278
Don't.

34
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:37,407
I think I got infected by
my fellow inmates.

35
00:02:38,283 --> 00:02:40,326
I don't want to stay here.
How much longer must I stay here?

36
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:43,997
Remember, I promised you
that I would help you.

37
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,166
I will get you out of here.

38
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:47,876
You should!

39
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:49,752
Mother, don't get mad at Sam.

40
00:02:50,712 --> 00:02:52,005
Let's trust her.

41
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:53,715
She says she'll get me out of here.

42
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,300
She'll do it.

43
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,136
You will not forsake me, right, Sam?

44
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,742
George?

45
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:23,745
George, get up.

46
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,039
That Beverly is here again.

47
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,708
She's so shameless.

48
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:33,171
You know, if I didn't know
Sir Galvan would stop me,

49
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,673
I would drag her off and have
that mistress run over by a car!

50
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,508
She's so annoying!

51
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,450
What are you looking for, George?

52
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:07,956
Abdul already took it as evidence,

53
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,209
but I still have a copy
of the death threat on my phone.

54
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,464
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

55
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:24,722
Mother, could it be that it was Beverly
who sent this?

56
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:31,104
And could it be Beverly
who almost ran you over?

57
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,247
Mother,

58
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:53,042
thank you for not telling Francis
about what I did to him.

59
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:55,670
Why would I?

60
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:59,340
Will things change
if I tell him the truth?

61
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,428
He will get mad at me and…

62
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:04,929
Your brother is not like that.

63
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,016
If he finds out
that you took the morphine,

64
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:10,685
he will take responsibility for the case.

65
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,395
He'll say that he is guilty.

66
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,941
He would choose to be jailed
in your place.

67
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:18,860
Mother, I'm sorry.

68
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,446
I never wanted this.

69
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:23,740
I didn't know that this would happen.

70
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,367
It's already happened.

71
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:28,911
Let's just do everything we can now
to make sure he's released.

72
00:05:49,265 --> 00:05:51,225
Are you laughing now, Paco?

73
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,647
Francis is in jail.

74
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,694
Mother is mad at me.

75
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,326
Is this my karma…

76
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:12,789
for what I did to you?

77
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,019
Paco…

78
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,438
Paco, help me.

79
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,608
Help me, please.

80
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,319
Help me fix the mess I made.

81
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:47,073
Please.

82
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,260
Please…

83
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,055
Please…

84
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,726
Please.

85
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:45,381
May I just remind you
that this isn't a park?

86
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,885
You can't just go in and out of the estate
whenever you like.

87
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,765
I will just show this to Sir Galvan.

88
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:59,395
I'm sure he will be thrilled to see
the photo of his grandchild.

89
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,335
Uncle Galvan…

90
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,547
If you're here to plead
about your brother,

91
00:08:27,423 --> 00:08:29,008
you're wasting your time.

92
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,135
I know what you're going to tell me.

93
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:32,637
That he's innocent

94
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,014
and that someone framed him.

95
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:36,807
Because that's the truth.

96
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,852
He killed my son!

97
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,313
My only son.

98
00:08:51,239 --> 00:08:52,448
You're unbelievable.

99
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,784
At least I'm not a murderer.

100
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,788
I have no idea what you're talking about.

101
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:05,795
It's you who sent me this, right?

102
00:09:07,672 --> 00:09:10,591
GEORGE, BE CAREFUL OF YOUR HUSBAND!
HE WANTS YOU GONE!

103
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,221
And you weren't content with that letter.

104
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,057
You even tried to kill me

105
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,018
by trying to run me over
outside the hospital.

106
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,061
You want me dead.

107
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,230
You wanted Basil all to yourself

108
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:27,108
and for him to take responsibility
for your baby.

109
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,861
If it weren't for the fact that you're
carrying Aurora's grandchild,

110
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:32,613
I'd have you arrested too.

111
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,700
For what reason?

112
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:39,120
For bringing that killer into our lives.

113
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:40,663
Basil was right.

114
00:09:41,789 --> 00:09:43,124
You're paranoid.

115
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,336
No wonder he wanted to leave you.

116
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:48,963
What did you say?

117
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:51,799
Uncle Galvan, my brother is a good person.

118
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,428
He will pay for what he did to Basil,

119
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,514
and that, I promise you.

120
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,377
I know he didn't want you anymore.

121
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,590
What?

122
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:17,468
Papa is not here to defend you.

123
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:26,102
I don't need Sir Galvan to protect me.

124
00:11:28,771 --> 00:11:30,815
No way you can slap me again.

125
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,360
Get out of this property.

126
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,153
Get out!

127
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:38,155
Why would I get out?

128
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,492
I have a right to be here,
and so does my child.

129
00:11:42,576 --> 00:11:44,245
It's you who should leave.

130
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:45,996
Why would I leave?

131
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,332
I am the wife. I am the legal wife!

132
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:51,460
The only reason Basil married you

133
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,712
is because he felt sorry for you.

134
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:56,924
You always play the victim, right?

135
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,343
You don't know what you're talking about.

136
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,595
Basil does.

137
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,305
He told me.

138
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,559
He also said

139
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,561
he'd wanted to leave for a long time,

140
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:13,983
but he knew he'd be relentlessly hounded
by your quote, unquote, "cheap mother."

141
00:12:14,608 --> 00:12:16,694
You're really asking for it, huh?

142
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,404
- Ouch!
- You don't want to leave?

143
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,823
Fix that properly.

144
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:35,963
Sam!

145
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,174
Oh my God.

146
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,216
Sam!

147
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,676
Are you okay?

148
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,510
Sam!

149
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:44,263
Why?

150
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:46,891
Oh my God, you're bleeding!

151
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,518
Sam, what happened?

152
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,812
Come here!

153
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,814
Oh my God, my grandchild!

154
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,149
What happened? Come here!

155
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:58,068
Amando! Peter! DJ!

156
00:12:58,152 --> 00:12:59,195
Where are you?

157
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,821
Sit down!

158
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,282
Open the gates, we're leaving!

159
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:05,367
- Oh my God, what happened to you?
- Calm down.

160
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:08,287
No! It's the life of my grandchild
that is at stake here!

161
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:09,747
No one should calm down!

162
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,332
How are you feeling?

163
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:13,584
- DJ! Get the car!
- DJ, get the car!

164
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:14,502
Go. Hurry!

165
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,295
- We're leaving! Hurry!
- Where's the car? Hurry!

166
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,463
Where's Peter?

167
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:19,590
Where's everyone?

168
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,217
What's with you?

169
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,260
Peter! Help us here!

170
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,179
My God!

171
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,014
- Hurry up!
- Help us here!

172
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,265
Help us!

173
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,642
Oh my…

174
00:13:29,725 --> 00:13:30,851
Oh my God!

175
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:34,104
- Are you okay, Sam?
- Take it easy, ma'am.

176
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:36,315
No one can hear you here!

177
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:39,318
You don't want to leave?
You don't want to?

178
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,529
- Hey, stop it!
- Let me go!

179
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,072
Hey!

180
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,157
Stop it!

181
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,452
Beverly, are you okay?

182
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:50,788
Are you okay?

183
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:51,830
Yes.

184
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,419
Don't you dare lay a hand on Beverly
and my grandchild again.

185
00:13:58,462 --> 00:13:59,880
Grandchild?!

186
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:02,091
Pa, that's not Basil's child.

187
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,218
That woman is just fooling us!

188
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,512
The DNA results came in…

189
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,765
and it's a match.

190
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:31,328
Basil is the father of Beverly's baby.

191
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:36,542
I would never lie to you, Sir Galvan.

192
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,420
Everything I said was true.

193
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,883
I'm sorry that I had the baby
tested first.

194
00:14:45,968 --> 00:14:47,636
It's all water under the bridge now.

195
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:52,391
What matters is that you believe
everything I said.

196
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,396
Basil would never do this to me.

197
00:14:58,063 --> 00:14:58,856
Never.

198
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,109
Look, George.

199
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:04,486
I know it's not easy.

200
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,489
You're hurt. Betrayed.

201
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,911
But for the sake of the baby,

202
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,621
Basil's baby,

203
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,415
I hope you'll accept this.

204
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,587
Never.

205
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,881
George…

206
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,937
She'll come into her senses.

207
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,149
Even if she doesn't,

208
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,152
the people that truly matter

209
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,613
accept my baby.

210
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,367
Are you all right?

211
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,452
Nothing's hurting?

212
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,455
All right, that's good.

213
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,092
George, what happened with you
and Basil five months ago?

214
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:11,011
We'd just come back from our honeymoon.

215
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,224
Why did he look for someone else?
Did you fight?

216
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:20,396
Whether we fought or not,
he shouldn't have looked for someone else

217
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,190
because we promised to be
faithful to each other.

218
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:30,572
And now, Beverly is having a baby.

219
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:33,701
As for me, I don't have a husband

220
00:16:33,784 --> 00:16:35,119
or a child.

221
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:21,165
How's my grandchild, Jane?

222
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:23,083
The baby is safe.

223
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,587
Mrs. Palacios just had a spotting.

224
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:27,713
Thank God.

225
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:31,508
I recommend that she go on bed rest
for a couple of days.

226
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,261
She should avoid going out if it's hot,

227
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,637
and most of all,

228
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:37,723
she should avoid stress.

229
00:17:37,806 --> 00:17:38,974
Okay.

230
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,684
- Thanks a lot, Jane.
- Okay. Excuse me.

231
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,352
- Okay. I'll see you later. Yeah.
- Okay.

232
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,484
What were you doing
before you started bleeding?

233
00:17:50,694 --> 00:17:52,529
I went to talk to Uncle Galvan.

234
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:54,239
What's the point?

235
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:59,620
Did you really think that Galvan would
drop the case against Francis?

236
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,539
I had to try.

237
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:05,667
Even if you convince Galvan,

238
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:07,252
it's a murder case.

239
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:09,088
This is not like swindling someone,

240
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,674
which you can settle outside the court.

241
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,846
From now on, Sam,
you shouldn't leave the house.

242
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,724
Amando will keep a close watch on you.

243
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,019
Ma, that's not possible.

244
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:25,395
My brother needs me.

245
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,147
I need to do a lot of things.

246
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,607
He doesn't even have a lawyer

247
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:30,859
and his preliminary hearing is coming up.

248
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,450
Don't meddle with that.

249
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:44,164
My brother has no one but me to depend on.

250
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:03,433
My driver will pick you up
tomorrow, Attorney.

251
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,019
Good night.

252
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,856
You will help Francis?

253
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,652
This case is consuming Sam.

254
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,363
You saw what happened earlier, right?

255
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:20,284
It looks like you're softening
towards Sam.

256
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:23,370
She's still carrying Paco's child.

257
00:19:24,371 --> 00:19:26,790
Wait, Amando.

258
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:30,502
Why does it seem like
you don't want me to meddle?

259
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:35,507
Your brother will get mad if you meddle.

260
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:38,218
He still wants someone to pay
for poisoning his son.

261
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:40,470
Don't mind him.

262
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,890
He is too busy handling

263
00:19:42,973 --> 00:19:45,684
the drama between George
and Basil's mistress.

264
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,811
My concern now is Paco's son.

265
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,230
I will not allow that child
to be lost as well.

266
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:55,068
That baby is the only thing that's
keeping me alive, Amando.

267
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:11,460
How could you leave me and humiliate me?

268
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:22,512
Basil, I can't get pregnant.

269
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:28,310
My obstetrician says that
it's a hopeless case.

270
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,397
Don't cry, okay?

271
00:20:34,274 --> 00:20:35,692
It's okay.

272
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,070
Nothing changes.

273
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,821
All right?

274
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,283
My love for you will never change.

275
00:20:45,452 --> 00:20:47,412
If we can't have children,

276
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,414
so be it.

277
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,833
It will just be you and me

278
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:54,169
from this day

279
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,880
until the end of our days.

280
00:20:58,131 --> 00:21:01,927
Is that why it was okay with you
that I wouldn't have a child?

281
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:08,350
Because you knew you were having a child
with someone else?

282
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,123
Who's there?

283
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,226
Who's there?

284
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:04,364
Hello?

285
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:18,045
Who's there?

286
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,967
Inigo?

287
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,734
It's a good thing you came
because if you hadn't,

288
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,153
I might have destroyed Basil's tomb.

289
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:45,947
I'll stay and keep you company.

290
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:46,865
Here.

291
00:22:46,948 --> 00:22:48,700
I brought a lot of beer.

292
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:51,369
Go ahead and smash some.

293
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,039
What?

294
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,540
Smash some.

295
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,835
George,

296
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:00,045
you're hurting.

297
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:06,176
You suspected that Basil was cheating
on you, and now there's proof.

298
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,845
Get mad.

299
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:11,098
Go berserk.

300
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:16,061
You're not going to defend
your best friend?

301
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,230
For cheating on his wife?

302
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:20,774
Hell no.

303
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:26,655
Did Basil used to cheat in the past?

304
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,035
I guess…

305
00:23:35,288 --> 00:23:38,083
he cheated not because he likes Beverly.

306
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:41,128
He cheated because

307
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,630
he wants to escape something.

308
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,635
And what did he want to escape from?

309
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:49,761
Me?

310
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,306
I don't think so.

311
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:57,978
Basil is much more complicated
than he lets on.

312
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:15,954
Cheers.

313
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,472
Who owns those things?

314
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,023
Don't tell me
you're going to live here too.

315
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,817
That's what Sir wants…

316
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:48,403
I mean Uncle?

317
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:50,822
Papa Galvan?

318
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,659
See you around, housemate.

319
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,385
I understand,

320
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,805
but give me an update soon.

321
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:19,100
Yes.

322
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:21,811
Okay.

323
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:25,815
- Pa, I want that woman out of this house!
- I'll call you back.

324
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,196
George, calm down.

325
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,949
Beverly's pregnant.

326
00:25:34,032 --> 00:25:35,492
We have a lot of money.

327
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,745
We have a condo in Makati.
She can stay there.

328
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,247
She doesn't have to live here.

329
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,707
I want to monitor her 24/7.

330
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:44,376
At my own expense?

331
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,379
Pa, she's still Basil's mistress,

332
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,839
Basil's lover!

333
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,261
Isn't it enough, and embarrassing enough,

334
00:25:54,344 --> 00:25:57,055
that your son cheated on me?

335
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,767
And now you even want me
to live under the same roof

336
00:26:00,850 --> 00:26:01,977
with that whore?

337
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,271
Watch your mouth, woman!

338
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:08,817
She's still the mother
of my future grandchild.

339
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,986
What about me, Pa?

340
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:14,906
I'm still Basil's wife.

341
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:20,745
Don't I deserve even just a tiny bit
of respect in this house?

342
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:43,476
I'm sorry for putting you in a rough spot.

343
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:55,530
I can accept the baby

344
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,699
eventually.

345
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,077
I just need more time.

346
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:08,418
If you need more time to process
this new setup…

347
00:27:12,422 --> 00:27:15,508
you have an option to stay
in our condo in Makati.

348
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,761
No.

349
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,679
No, Pa.

350
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:24,142
Let's stay together like sardines in a can
in this house.

351
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,019
I'm not leaving this house!

352
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,335
Your stepbrother's girl is pretty, Sofia.

353
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:51,378
It's my turn.

354
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,004
- It's my turn.
- Hurry up.

355
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,674
Really, Louie? Are you interested?

356
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,177
Can't it just be that I'm curious?

357
00:27:59,260 --> 00:28:00,887
I just want to know what she looks like.

358
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:06,643
She's okay.

359
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:07,727
Not my type.

360
00:28:07,811 --> 00:28:09,270
Oh, not your type.

361
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,689
She's actually really nice, you know?

362
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,359
She wants me to be close
to my future relative.

363
00:28:14,442 --> 00:28:16,694
Do you like her more than George?

364
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,405
George is in beast mode

365
00:28:18,488 --> 00:28:20,448
because Basil cheated on her.

366
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,644
Why is she going berserk?

367
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,855
Didn't you know?

368
00:28:56,943 --> 00:29:01,573
It's already confirmed that Sir Basil is
the father of Ma'am Bev's baby.

369
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:04,117
Yes.

370
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:09,038
It's amazing because
two Palacios babies are arriving.

371
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,791
One is Ma'am Bev's and the other is yours.

372
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:16,755
While it's zero for Ma'am George.

373
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,048
Maybe that's why she's acting that way.

374
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,133
DJ.

375
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:29,392
Sam.

376
00:29:29,851 --> 00:29:32,228
You and your baby might be affected.

377
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:36,775
Mommy Margaret told me that

378
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,986
cheating is
the second most painful experience

379
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,864
that could happen to any married person.

380
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,699
So what's the first?

381
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:46,701
Being a widow.

382
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,079
I pity George.

383
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:51,831
The pain she's feeling is twofold.

384
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,793
She was cheated on

385
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:56,836
and her husband was poisoned too.

386
00:29:57,754 --> 00:30:01,508
Anyway, in murder mysteries,
that's one of the famous motives.

387
00:30:02,217 --> 00:30:03,384
Betrayal.

388
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,471
Could that be George's motive?

389
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,515
She got really hurt.

390
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,017
Therefore, she had Basil killed.

391
00:30:11,684 --> 00:30:12,936
You never know.

392
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:13,895
What did you say?

393
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,063
Hey, bro!

394
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,788
George, that's enough, let's talk.

395
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,542
And why?

396
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:40,380
To rub in the fact that
you're having a baby?

397
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:41,881
Well, fine, good for you!

398
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,717
You're the lucky one.
You're the one who's having a baby!

399
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:46,219
You're the one God loves!

400
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:49,305
George, it's not the end of the world.

401
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,016
It is for me.

402
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,185
I will never have children,

403
00:30:54,269 --> 00:30:57,981
and my husband died
because of your brother!

404
00:30:58,731 --> 00:31:01,901
It was not Francis
who killed your husband.

405
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:03,444
Then who did?

406
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:04,320
You?

407
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,905
Maybe you did.

408
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:10,410
Do you want to end up like those pots?

409
00:31:10,493 --> 00:31:12,579
You and the baby in your tummy?

410
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:19,419
George, since when did you become violent?

411
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:22,130
I've known you for years,
but you never used to be like this.

412
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:24,299
You don't know anything.

413
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:29,512
And don't say that I'm your friend
because I will really hurt you.

414
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:32,098
Be careful.

415
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:35,018
They might think that was your motive
for killing your husband.

416
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:38,479
I hate you!

417
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,482
I hate this family!

418
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:44,235
I hate this family!

419
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:20,104
That's roughly around
ten million pesos' worth of jewelry.

420
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,857
You can have all of it.

421
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:28,363
I just want one thing in return.

422
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,240
I will not leave this house.

423
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:33,785
I want your baby.

424
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:37,997
After you give birth,
you will give the baby to me.

425
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:42,961
I will raise the baby and I will treat
your baby like my own child.

426
00:33:00,687 --> 00:33:02,981
You can keep your diamonds.

427
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,857
My baby is not for sale.

428
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,485
Basil married me.

429
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,903
I am the wife.

430
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:13,574
That's why I should be
carrying his baby, not you.

431
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,910
Then why didn't you?

432
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,666
How much do you want?

433
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:24,794
Fifteen million? Twenty million?

434
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,004
Name your price.

435
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,880
Even if I do,

436
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:30,049
you can't afford it.

437
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,218
You see,

438
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:34,637
this baby

439
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,305
is priceless.

440
00:33:37,932 --> 00:33:39,600
After I give birth,

441
00:33:40,601 --> 00:33:43,104
I can even get more than
what you can offer.

442
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,375
Louie, that's enough.

443
00:34:05,251 --> 00:34:07,170
Are you accusing my sister?

444
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:08,963
What?

445
00:34:10,673 --> 00:34:12,091
- Ward, stop it!
- It's Francis!

446
00:34:12,175 --> 00:34:13,551
Enough. Even my shoes are
being dragged into this!

447
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,428
- It's Francis who killed Basil.
- Ward!

448
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,971
- Ward, that's enough!
- It wasn't George!

449
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,306
That's enough!

450
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,682
You too!

451
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:21,350
You should be taking our side

452
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,603
because we're like family to you.

453
00:34:23,686 --> 00:34:27,315
Wait, Ward. We were
just brainstorming theories here.

454
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:32,111
Francis' motive is not convincing.

455
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:33,446
It's possible…

456
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:37,492
It's possible that someone else
might have been mad at Basil, right?

457
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,161
Leave. You're not family.

458
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,831
My daughter, Sofia,
is Galvan's daughter too.

459
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,875
Come on, can your trash outside.

460
00:34:46,542 --> 00:34:47,919
Don't bring it in.

461
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:49,212
Vivian, I told you not to…

462
00:34:49,295 --> 00:34:52,840
I told you already, Mommy.
We're not welcome here.

463
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,008
He said we're garbage.

464
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,095
It's possible…

465
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,431
that it's her.

466
00:35:12,193 --> 00:35:15,947
You remind me so much of Paco.
You're so stubborn.

467
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,242
Your doctor just told you that
you need rest, Sam.

468
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,911
I'm just looking for a lawyer for Francis.

469
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:24,122
I've printed out a list of prospects.

470
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,582
I already found one for you.

471
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,627
He will help you with your brother's case.

472
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,713
And in return,

473
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,550
you'll promise me

474
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:39,262
that you'll take care of yourself
and your baby

475
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,389
until you give birth, Sam.

476
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,267
Thank you.

477
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:51,107
My goodness, George.

478
00:35:52,191 --> 00:35:53,317
I knew it.

479
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,444
Beverly is only after the money.

480
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,821
What will happen to us?

481
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,198
We might get kicked out of here.

482
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,616
Really, Mother?

483
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:02,952
That's your only concern?

484
00:36:03,035 --> 00:36:07,165
Money, wealth, and holding on
to the Palacios family?

485
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,250
What about it?

486
00:36:09,333 --> 00:36:10,960
Is it bad to be practical?

487
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,629
When your father fooled us,
did I go to pieces?

488
00:36:13,713 --> 00:36:14,839
Did I drown myself in alcohol?

489
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:15,965
No, right?

490
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:18,134
I supported you and your brother.

491
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:19,927
Mother, that was me.

492
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,306
I was the one who worked so we could eat.

493
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,807
I worked in Singapore

494
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:26,350
and that's where I became barren!

495
00:36:28,144 --> 00:36:31,606
Sam, this is Attorney Joseph Kintanar.

496
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:35,860
He's one of the best defense lawyers
in the country,

497
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,487
with a winning rate of 99%.

498
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,825
99.8%, to be exact.

499
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,620
Are you correcting me, Attorney?

500
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,955
I like things to be exact

501
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,874
as the law is an exact endeavor.

502
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,378
Sam, a pleasure to meet you.

503
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,421
Nice to meet you.

504
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:57,215
Excuse me.

505
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:58,591
Attorney.

506
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:04,722
So, you say your brother is innocent.

507
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:11,020
Who then do you think
poisoned Basil Palacios?

508
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,611
Hold on, George.

509
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:23,532
Why are you blaming me
when I wasn't the one who hurt you?

510
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,995
Mother, you forced me to be an OFW
even though I didn't want to be one.

511
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,958
But, George, you said it was okay
and you agreed.

512
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:34,085
You said it was for our family.

513
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,045
Yes, Mother.

514
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,296
It was my choice.

515
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,341
It was my choice to leave
to make you happy.

516
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:43,302
But now that I've given you
what you wanted,

517
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,221
can you make me happy?

518
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:47,223
Can you give me a child?

519
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,466
<i>Beverly was invited</i>
<i>to Basil's birthday party?</i>

520
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,753
You will slice the cake,
and that's when we'll find out.

521
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,963
Blue if it's a boy, pink if it's a girl.

522
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,174
I want it simple.

523
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,885
I don't want too much attention.

524
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,889
The people here see me
as Basil's mistress.

525
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:52,973
Beverly,

526
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,393
don't you ever call yourself that.

527
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,646
Well, Uncle, all I want

528
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,190
is for the baby to be born healthy.

529
00:40:02,149 --> 00:40:05,152
With Basil's baby inside of you,

530
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:07,446
you can now wish for bigger things.

531
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,449
You just don't know how much
you've made me happy.

532
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:19,333
Sergeant Casas, I wasn't expecting you.

533
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,212
Are you Ms. Beverly Maison?

534
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,589
Yes, that's me.

535
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,716
Can we invite you to the police station?

536
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,635
We just want to ask you some questions.

537
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:31,095
Why, Sergeant?

538
00:40:31,762 --> 00:40:33,889
Mr. Galvan, we received a tip about her.

539
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:39,103
We just want to know where she was
the night of your son's murder.

540
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:53,451
Beverly Maison was at home at the time
Basil Palacios got murdered.

541
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,328
That's according to my sources
at the police station.

542
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:04,086
We have other suspects.

543
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:07,298
Suspects that were present
at the scene of the crime.

544
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,717
But my gut tells me

545
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,302
it's George.

546
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:17,641
Infidelity has always been
the leading motive for mariticide,

547
00:41:17,725 --> 00:41:21,187
or the killing of one's own spouse.

548
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,189
But all we have is a motive.

549
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:25,733
We don't have strong evidence.

550
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,861
Lucky for us, here in the Philippines,

551
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:34,158
eye-witness testimony carries more weight
than that of physical evidence.

552
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,369
What do you mean?

553
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,208
The court gives more credence

554
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:46,212
to a witness who personally saw
the suspect commit the crime.

555
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,713
In our case,

556
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:55,221
do you think anyone saw George
put morphine in Basil's drink?

557
00:41:56,847 --> 00:41:59,433
If someone did, they would have
spoken up a long time ago.

558
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,852
Unless that person was scared.

559
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,941
That will be your mission.

560
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:12,238
Uncover the secrets of George…

561
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:15,741
and the people around her.

562
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,876
But I had nothing to do
with Basil's murder.

563
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,795
Sergeant Casas,

564
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:30,798
don't you have a suspect already?

565
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:32,591
Sam's brother.

566
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:34,760
Sir Galvan,

567
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,805
this is just routine questioning.

568
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,224
We just want to ask her
about her statement

569
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:42,393
just in case we forgot something.

570
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:46,480
But, Uncle, I'm innocent.

571
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:50,150
Beverly, don't say a word.

572
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:51,694
I will call my lawyer, okay?

573
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:54,405
There's nothing to worry about.

574
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:57,866
Let's go.

575
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,119
This way.

576
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:01,245
Sir.

577
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,466
Hello, Attorney.

578
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,888
I just need to consult you
about something.

579
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,154
NEXT EPISODE

580
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,157
Who did this?

581
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:40,159
You did this!

582
00:43:40,618 --> 00:43:41,785
George!

583
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,912
Who else is mad at me?

584
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,290
So I'll be scared? So I'll leave?

585
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,542
I'm not going anywhere!

586
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,085
And maybe you should!

587
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,170
What?

588
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:54,715
Be thankful nothing happened
to Beverly or my grandchild.

589
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:56,842
But I'm warning each and every one of you,

590
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:59,178
<i>do not hurt my grandchild!</i>

591
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:03,057
People will look for allies
if they have enemies.

592
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:05,017
And you will be that ally.

593
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,395
That is how you learn their secrets.

594
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:12,524
There will be two new members
of the Palacios family.

595
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:16,195
Could those be the babies being carried
by Ma'am Sam and Ma'am Bev?

596
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:17,237
That's all?

597
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,573
There are no extra Palacios
family members?

598
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:22,493
Not even those… who are just half?

599
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:26,246
When Basil found out that George
couldn't give him a child,

600
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,539
he wanted to leave her.

601
00:44:27,623 --> 00:44:29,291
That's why you killed him.

602
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,959
Don't come near us!

603
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:34,755
I swear to God, I will stab this woman!
