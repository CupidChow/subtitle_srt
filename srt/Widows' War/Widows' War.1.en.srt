1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:17,600
<i>What makes a house a home?</i>

2
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:19,811
<i>Is it the design?</i>

3
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:22,063
<i>The architecture?</i>

4
00:00:22,147 --> 00:00:23,857
<i>The color of the curtain</i>

5
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:25,525
<i>or the size of the bed?</i>

6
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,697
<i>Or is it the people who live in it?</i>

7
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,058
Paco!

8
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:27,814
Paco!

9
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,935
Oh, Paco! Paco!

10
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,521
Wake up, please. Please, wake up!

11
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,149
Please, please, please.

12
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:15,194
Paco! Wake up!

13
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:22,744
Who killed my son?!

14
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,795
Paco!

15
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:37,550
Paco!

16
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,679
Paco!

17
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,065
Our designs are people-centric.

18
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:54,525
We don't only make sure that
your houses are beautiful.

19
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,404
We make comfort and livability
our top priority.

20
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:01,741
I love it!

21
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,953
It's a winner, right?

22
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:06,704
My sister is amazing.

23
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,375
So, if I were you, I'd say yes right away.

24
00:04:11,417 --> 00:04:12,919
It's okay with me.

25
00:04:13,002 --> 00:04:14,379
But

26
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,048
don't you have any discounts
on your price?

27
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,303
Sir, you know we have a saying
in business, right?

28
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,139
If you want fast and cheap,
it won't be good.

29
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:27,308
But if you want good and fast,

30
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:28,518
it won't be cheap.

31
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:32,689
My husband is just stingy.

32
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,566
But at the end of the day,

33
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,361
the wife always wins.

34
00:04:38,444 --> 00:04:40,655
And my decision is…

35
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:41,823
yes!

36
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,157
- Yes?
- Yes.

37
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,034
- Yes!
- Yes!

38
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,160
Perfect!

39
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:47,870
Actually, I already have a contract here.

40
00:04:47,954 --> 00:04:51,708
You can go over it so we can start
your dream home.

41
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,334
- Okay, thank you.
- I'll leave you to it.

42
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,961
Okay.

43
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:57,297
We will see about that.

44
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,172
Here you go.

45
00:04:58,256 --> 00:04:59,632
Thanks for the recommendation.

46
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,759
Oh my, you of all people.

47
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:04,971
Besides, I know I won't be embarrassed
when it comes to you.

48
00:05:05,054 --> 00:05:08,683
You're not only talented,
your work ethic is a winner.

49
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:11,311
Look, they fell for your charms.

50
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,895
Not charm.

51
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,147
Confidence.

52
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,817
You should be impressed with yourself,
especially if you know what you're doing.

53
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,069
Arrogant!

54
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:23,531
- Thank you so much, sis.
- Sure.

55
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,705
Sis, I need to go home.

56
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,999
Something's happened to Papa.

57
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,586
- Is it okay if I…? Can you manage here?
- It's okay, I'll take care of this. Go.

58
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,797
Sir, ma'am, I'm sorry, I have to go.
There's a family emergency.

59
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,257
George will take care of you.

60
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,051
- Okay, thank you.
- Thank you.

61
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,218
Excuse me.

62
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:04,322
Mother? Francis?

63
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,657
Your father is gone.

64
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:08,785
Orly is gone.

65
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:14,540
Where is Papa?

66
00:06:41,025 --> 00:06:42,944
The family is here. Yes, sir.

67
00:07:12,974 --> 00:07:13,850
Pa.

68
00:07:13,933 --> 00:07:16,894
Pa…

69
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:25,319
Pa…

70
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,831
Ma'am, I'm offering my condolences.

71
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,210
It's a good thing, ma'am, that
his neighbors reported

72
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,713
that they smelled something foul.

73
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,715
When we got into his apartment,

74
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,177
Dr. Orly was already dead.

75
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,596
And we also saw this, ma'am.

76
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:01,147
This is Papa's handwriting.

77
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:06,402
Based on the initial medico-legal report,

78
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:10,406
Dr. Orly died from a heroin overdose.

79
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,824
What?

80
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,035
Papa was taking drugs?

81
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,537
No.

82
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:20,291
Papa was not a drug addict
and he would never commit suicide.

83
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:25,963
Ma'am, we saw a lot of paraphernalia
in his room.

84
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:38,976
Wait, sir, no.

85
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,646
Papa was a decent person. He was a doctor.

86
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:44,649
Ma'am, we can't really say.

87
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:49,862
Sometimes, the people we think are decent
are the ones who are hiding their stench.

88
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,114
Wait a second, sir.

89
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:55,201
Didn't you hear me?
Papa was a decent person.

90
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,577
Do your job!

91
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:58,246
You should investigate.

92
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:01,082
I know something is happening
with the mining company.

93
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:03,960
Investigate that. Ask the people there!

94
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:05,920
Do your job!

95
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,255
- There might have been foul play.
- Dear, enough.

96
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:09,799
No, Mother! What,
are we just going to accept this?

97
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:12,301
That Papa committed suicide?

98
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:16,013
We know he'd never do that.
Papa didn't commit suicide!

99
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:18,182
No! No!

100
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,767
Pa!

101
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,478
No.

102
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,355
No! No!

103
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,523
Sam, enough.

104
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:31,362
There's nothing to investigate. That's it.

105
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,539
Pa… no…

106
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,439
Dad…

107
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,859
Why did you leave?

108
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,825
Why was it so sudden?

109
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,497
The last time we were together,

110
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,874
we were even laughing.

111
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,097
I got it first! I won!
Winner! Winner! Winner!

112
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,807
Oh my, my child.

113
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,600
- You lose?
- Yes!

114
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,102
I just let you win.

115
00:11:26,185 --> 00:11:27,603
- Really?
- Of course.

116
00:11:27,686 --> 00:11:30,314
So you won't miss me
when I go back to the mines.

117
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,485
Pa, why do you have to go back there?

118
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:37,488
Just work here in Manila
so we can be together.

119
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,823
Yes, Pa.

120
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:42,701
You know, the people there need me more.

121
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:45,996
And besides, my boss is paying me well.

122
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,748
The Palacios family?

123
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,624
Yes, Sam.

124
00:11:48,707 --> 00:11:52,044
What they told me is that
the Palacios family,

125
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,587
who owns the mines,

126
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:57,174
is one of the richest families
in the Philippines,

127
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,634
but they're not announcing it.

128
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:00,428
They're silent billionaires.

129
00:12:00,511 --> 00:12:02,847
Who knows? They might give me a gold bar.

130
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:05,349
What? Gold bar? Goodness!

131
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,476
- Someone wants a gold bar.
- This is it!

132
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,105
I want that so we can have our roof fixed.

133
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,273
Oh well.

134
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:13,983
Let's prioritize the house first.

135
00:12:14,066 --> 00:12:16,485
No, let's do the car first.

136
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:19,238
Once the car is fully paid off,

137
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,031
we'll focus on the new house next.

138
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:23,993
- Really? Wow!
- No need to have the house repaired.

139
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,912
My dream is to have
a beautiful house for us.

140
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:29,373
You know, everyone wants that.

141
00:12:29,457 --> 00:12:31,500
But it shouldn't be based on how big
or beautiful the house is.

142
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,460
Remember this.

143
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:35,129
It all depends on the people living in it.

144
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:38,215
- Right.
- Yes, that's right.

145
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,510
Pa, after that,
I'd be happy with a motorbike or car.

146
00:12:41,594 --> 00:12:42,928
Hey, me first.

147
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,305
Look, I won!

148
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:45,973
What's my prize, Pa?

149
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:50,394
Well, teach me how to do this
so that I can give you a prize.

150
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:52,062
I thought you said you just let me win.

151
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,397
- No!
- Got you!

152
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:55,566
I thought you said
you wanted me to stay here.

153
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:59,153
- How come you want me to work in the mine?
- Because we want the gold bar.

154
00:12:59,236 --> 00:12:59,904
Hey!

155
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,432
Sorry.

156
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,601
- Miss--
- Don't touch me.

157
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:57,187
Miss, I'm not a bad person.

158
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,356
I won't hurt you.

159
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,444
I am Paco.

160
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:07,031
I work for Palacios Mining.

161
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:09,408
You're the daughter
of Dr. Orly Castillo, right?

162
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:11,702
How did you know?

163
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,998
We couldn't contact
the emergency number listed in his file.

164
00:15:16,081 --> 00:15:20,628
That's why we asked
the workers here to contact us

165
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:23,839
if someone visited his grave.

166
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,092
On behalf of Palacios Mining,

167
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,762
our deepest condolences.

168
00:15:35,559 --> 00:15:36,769
Thank you.

169
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,032
I still can't believe
what happened to Doc.

170
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,743
Drugs? Suicide?

171
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,829
Nobody expected that from him.

172
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,666
I guess some people are good at hiding.

173
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:04,421
With all due respect, sir,

174
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:06,215
my father was a decent person.

175
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:10,469
You can believe what you want to believe
but my father was a good person.

176
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:11,679
He's already dead.

177
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,222
Don't insult his memory.

178
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:16,058
- I did not mean--
- There are people good at hiding?

179
00:16:16,141 --> 00:16:17,476
What do you mean by that?

180
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,355
You can have your money back.

181
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,400
I don't need help that comes with insults.

182
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:39,248
Yes, his jokes are really funny.

183
00:16:39,331 --> 00:16:40,541
Another one. Another one.

184
00:16:40,624 --> 00:16:43,043
What else? What else do you have?

185
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:45,295
Here! Which part of a pregnant female
arrives first when entering a room?

186
00:16:45,379 --> 00:16:47,006
- What? The stomach!
- Pregnant? Her stomach!

187
00:16:47,089 --> 00:16:49,091
- No.
- What part?

188
00:16:49,174 --> 00:16:50,592
- You don't want to guess anymore?
- What part?

189
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,594
- What is it?
- What?

190
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,346
The nose! The pregnant female
entering is a dog!

191
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:56,932
Crazy!

192
00:16:57,474 --> 00:16:58,642
What's this?

193
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,395
Hey, Sam!

194
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:03,105
- Sam!
- Hey, Sam!

195
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,732
Good evening, Sam.

196
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,275
- Sam!
- Sorry about this.

197
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:07,401
My friends wanted to drink.

198
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,485
Shot first, Sam.

199
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,070
Thank you.

200
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:12,197
- This is great.
- Come on, Sam.

201
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,242
Papa hasn't been dead even 40 days yet,
and here you are celebrating?

202
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:16,577
You're such a killjoy.

203
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,287
This isn't much.

204
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,499
What's that?
Francis, you're now smoking?

205
00:17:22,583 --> 00:17:24,376
Since when, huh?

206
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:27,337
What is this? Was it you who taught him?

207
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:29,840
It's just cigarettes.
Don't make such a big deal of it.

208
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,759
Be thankful he isn't doing drugs.
Right, Bro?

209
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,677
That's right! No drugs!

210
00:17:33,761 --> 00:17:37,389
Hey, I'm getting pissed at you already.
You're teaching my brother bad habits.

211
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,141
- Seriously, George?
- I'm so pissed with you.

212
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,018
And you, all of you,
do you call yourselves friends?

213
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,519
Sam, wait. Sam, take it easy.

214
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,064
No. Why are you being friends
with people like that?

215
00:17:45,147 --> 00:17:48,358
That's enough. I'm just trying
to have some fun.

216
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,528
It's sad here at home.

217
00:17:53,947 --> 00:17:56,158
Francis, stop smoking.

218
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,494
You know that having poor lungs
runs in the family.

219
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,454
Stop smoking.

220
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,170
What's that? It smells like
something is burning.

221
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,465
Why does it smell like
something's burning? Mother?

222
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,176
Mother?

223
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,262
What you're cooking is burning!
Mother, wait.

224
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,472
Mother, let me.

225
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,474
- How long has this been like this?
- Mother, Sam, what's happening?

226
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,809
Hold on! It's so hot.

227
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,103
I'll take care of this.
Get out of here, Sam.

228
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,479
- Help.
- All right.

229
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:26,563
Be careful.

230
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:30,150
- I'll take care of this.
- Hold on, wait!

231
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,903
Sam, Mother, get out of here.
Get out of here!

232
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,238
Guys, help!

233
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,364
Help!

234
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,573
Help us! There's a fire!

235
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,909
Francis, be careful!

236
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:01,056
Almost the entire house burned down.
The electric circuit got burned too.

237
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:08,397
Mother, what's with you?
Why weren't you more careful?

238
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,859
I remembered your papa.

239
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:14,444
What I was cooking was his favorite dish.

240
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,699
If you weren't okay,
you should've just stayed in your room.

241
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,660
Sam, all you do is blame Mother.
Why can't you be more understanding?

242
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
She was just sad.
She didn't mean for it to happen.

243
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,957
I understand that,
but this was avoidable, right?

244
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,877
Look at us now!
What's going to happen to us?

245
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,796
It's okay, Mother.

246
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:54,276
Sis…

247
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,212
Sis, I came as soon as I heard.

248
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,380
Are you okay? Did any of you get hurt?

249
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:17,341
No one, thank God.

250
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:19,176
Thank you, George.

251
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,970
Get your things.

252
00:20:22,971 --> 00:20:25,182
Why? Where are we going?

253
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:27,893
I can't just leave you here.

254
00:20:27,976 --> 00:20:31,063
Come with me.
You can stay at my place for now.

255
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:56,171
- George, is this really okay?
- Of course.

256
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,675
That's the apartment we're renting out.

257
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,842
It's perfect timing.

258
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,762
Our tenant just moved out,
so feel at home.

259
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,892
How much is the rent?

260
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:12,646
- Come on. It's free.
- No, come on.

261
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:15,816
Just think of it as my way
of thanking you.

262
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:19,820
Did you know, Auntie Mercy, that I owe
a huge debt of gratitude to Sam?

263
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:23,657
I would have failed Math 17
if she hadn't helped me.

264
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,616
Not really.

265
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,910
My daughter is really helpful.

266
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,248
But she's always absent during reunions.

267
00:21:31,331 --> 00:21:33,834
But now she has no choice.

268
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:35,877
Even if she doesn't want to come,
I will force her to.

269
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,046
George…

270
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,589
Thank you.

271
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:42,134
My sister is so lucky

272
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:45,262
because she has
such a kind and beautiful friend.

273
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,141
What's this?

274
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:51,393
- Are you trying to sweet-talk George too?
- What, Sam?

275
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,562
What's wrong with that?
There's no problem, right?

276
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:55,439
She's single and so am I.

277
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:58,025
So there's nothing wrong with that.

278
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:00,569
And don't you like that your best friend
will be your sister-in-law?

279
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:02,738
What sister-in-law are you talking about?

280
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:05,157
Give me that! Get the other stuff there.

281
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,285
All you do is try to be cute.

282
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:09,161
My goodness.

283
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,579
Francis is so silly.

284
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:16,168
Ward, hi.

285
00:22:16,251 --> 00:22:17,753
Ward, this is Sam.

286
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:21,298
That's her mother, Auntie Mercy,
and her brother, Francis.

287
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:23,633
Kindly help them with their things.

288
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,761
Francis, this is my brother, Ward.

289
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:31,183
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

290
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:32,976
Are they your visitors?

291
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,563
Mother, Father, do you remember Sam?

292
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,106
That's her mother, Auntie Mercy,

293
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,942
and her brother over there, Francis.

294
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,070
These are my parents, by the way.

295
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:45,489
Thank you for taking us in.

296
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:47,574
Just make sure you clean up.

297
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,367
I don't want a dirty house.

298
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:53,997
I'm Bert, by the way.

299
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:57,292
I'll take you to your new place.

300
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,505
- Just a second.
- Thank you.

301
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:02,839
- Let's go.
- This way.

302
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:03,965
Let's go.

303
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,676
This is it.

304
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,637
- Thank you again.
- Come on.

305
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,348
Hello. Good evening.

306
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,100
Good evening.

307
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,309
Come in.

308
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:16,853
Can you help with the next lot too?

309
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,777
George mentioned to me

310
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:29,074
that your husband just died recently.

311
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,537
My condolences.

312
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,130
It's probably difficult, being a widow.

313
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:49,553
If you need anything,

314
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,597
don't be shy to come to us.

315
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:57,602
Francis?

316
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,605
Francis, dear?

317
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:15,912
Where did you buy this?

318
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,373
They really match?

319
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:20,292
It's cute!

320
00:24:20,375 --> 00:24:23,044
Don't you like it?
We're like twin sisters?

321
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:24,671
Really?

322
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,339
Don't you want it?

323
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:28,216
I'm sorry. You know I don't have a sister.

324
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,677
It's not as if I can ask Ward
to dress like this.

325
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,554
What's with you? Can't you take a joke?

326
00:24:32,637 --> 00:24:33,638
I really like it.

327
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:35,557
- It suits me.
- Really? Looks cute, right?

328
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,642
I like this. Girl bonding.

329
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:39,352
Twinning.

330
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:43,565
- Oh my God! It's our favorite song!
- This is the best part!

331
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,275
Here it goes.

332
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:50,280
Do you know the steps?

333
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:51,781
Here we go!

334
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:16,848
Hey!

335
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:19,267
Remember what you did before?

336
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:20,268
- And then this--
- Here it goes!

337
00:25:28,985 --> 00:25:30,028
Whoo!

338
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:03,103
We were so happy just before.

339
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,650
I feel guilty.

340
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,862
I feel like I shouldn't be this happy.

341
00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,948
Is it because of your father?

342
00:26:17,158 --> 00:26:19,953
That's because he died tragically.

343
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:25,083
Sis, I'm sorry to ask, but could it be
because his workplace was toxic?

344
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:27,252
Was his mental health affected?

345
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,046
Maybe.

346
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:34,759
He used to tell me about
the situation at their work,

347
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:38,555
and that the Palacios family
didn't do anything for their employees.

348
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:43,727
As for me, if ever I marry a rich guy,
I will still be kind.

349
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,687
I will share my blessings.

350
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,939
How about you, sis?

351
00:26:48,023 --> 00:26:49,232
What are you looking for?

352
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:52,193
I have no time for a love life.

353
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,989
You only say that
because you haven't met someone yet.

354
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,742
But tonight,

355
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,746
we're going on a double date.

356
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,957
Sis, I'm sorry, but I can't.
Next time, okay?

357
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:07,917
I have an early start for work tomorrow.

358
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,837
But I don't want to go to the bar alone.

359
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,506
Please, come with me.

360
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,842
Please? Go with me.

361
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,472
Fine.

362
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,058
Okay, I was thinking of not going, but…

363
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:33,485
Are you ready?

364
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,863
You're asking me?
Of course, that's the goal!

365
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,239
- Yeah!
- Hey!

366
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,991
That's what I'm telling you.

367
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:41,576
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

368
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:42,535
Cheers.

369
00:27:42,619 --> 00:27:43,578
Champagne?

370
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,537
No, thank you.

371
00:27:44,621 --> 00:27:46,414
I'll just have water. Thank you.

372
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,540
Thank you.

373
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:51,461
- This place looks great.
- I know.

374
00:27:54,297 --> 00:27:56,674
- Sis, are you okay?
- I'm okay.

375
00:27:56,758 --> 00:27:59,219
I'm just thinking about Mother.

376
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:00,887
She's all alone at home.

377
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:02,889
Francis also went out.

378
00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:06,476
- That's okay. Let's enjoy ourselves!
- It's okay. Go.

379
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,727
Don't worry about me.

380
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,021
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

381
00:28:11,106 --> 00:28:12,732
I'm already bored.

382
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:15,693
Perfect, there's a motel nearby.

383
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:18,113
Do you want to rest?

384
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:19,614
Excuse me?!

385
00:28:19,697 --> 00:28:21,199
You're so rude! Are you crazy?

386
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,326
Do you think you are someone beautiful?

387
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,536
You're playing too hard to get!

388
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,496
You're so shameless!

389
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,081
Hey, don't talk to my friend that way.

390
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,582
- Why?
- You girls are rude!

391
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:30,667
You girls are rude!

392
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:31,835
- You're the rude one.
- Hey!

393
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:34,295
- Hey!
- You're all rude.

394
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,463
You deserve that!

395
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,257
Hold on, why are you being so rude?

396
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:39,592
Get out of here! You're so rude!

397
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,177
Get out of here! You're so rude!

398
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,637
You're the ones who should leave!

399
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,848
You have no shame!

400
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:46,516
Rude!

401
00:29:06,077 --> 00:29:07,370
Francis?

402
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:11,750
Son?

403
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,170
Is that you?

404
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,525
Be quiet.

405
00:29:39,194 --> 00:29:42,030
Let me go!

406
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,248
Bert?

407
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:55,126
Bert?

408
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,422
I know you're sad and you're all alone.

409
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:02,467
- Let me make you happy.
- Let go of me!

410
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,733
Bert…

411
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,115
Let go of me! Help!

412
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:36,876
Bert?

413
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:50,014
If you make a noise,

414
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,433
I will kill you

415
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,686
and your children.

416
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,690
So do what I want. Okay?

417
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:05,738
Bert?

418
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,490
Stand up.

419
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:08,843
That's crazy!

420
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,470
- Did they follow us, girl?
- No.

421
00:32:10,553 --> 00:32:11,930
But just keep on running.

422
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:18,937
They're gone. They're gone.

423
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,480
That guy was so rude!

424
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,815
- What if we call the police on them?
- Just relax.

425
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,108
- They're gone already.
- They're annoying.

426
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:25,318
They're driving me mad.

427
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:27,904
Oh my God.

428
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:30,073
Sis, thank you.

429
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,284
You defended me out there earlier.

430
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,829
Of course. We're sisters.

431
00:32:36,913 --> 00:32:39,040
Sisters defend each other

432
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,500
and sisters protect each other.

433
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,337
And I know that when the time comes
that I'm in need,

434
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,005
you'll defend me too.

435
00:32:46,089 --> 00:32:48,257
Yes, of course!

436
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:52,720
And no one and nothing
can destroy our friendship.

437
00:32:52,804 --> 00:32:54,430
Remember that.

438
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,351
Stop crying.

439
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:00,353
Why?

440
00:33:00,436 --> 00:33:02,605
Are you not enjoying it?

441
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:06,234
Don't you dare tell anyone.

442
00:33:07,443 --> 00:33:09,529
I will give you everything you want.

443
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:40,977
You're so shameless!

444
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,066
Ruth, help me.
Your husband forced me.

445
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:50,028
You're so disgusting!
You're doing this in my own house?!

446
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,363
It's not my fault. She seduced me!

447
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,783
Come here.

448
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,243
Get out here!

449
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,454
Get out!

450
00:34:00,496 --> 00:34:01,706
- She seduced me!
- Get out!

451
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,374
Get out!

452
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,251
Get out of here!

453
00:34:05,334 --> 00:34:06,919
- Get out!
- That's enough, Ruth!

454
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:08,463
Get out!

455
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:09,672
Ruth!

456
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,924
We really took in a snake here!

457
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,347
Oh my, every time we go out…

458
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,891
I'll open the gate.

459
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,810
Get out of here!

460
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,355
You're such a flirt!

461
00:34:28,524 --> 00:34:29,650
You're such a flirt!

462
00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:30,860
Get out!

463
00:34:30,943 --> 00:34:32,487
What's that?

464
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,113
Mother?

465
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:35,406
What's happening here?

466
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,993
It's your mother!
I caught her in bed with my husband!

467
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:40,995
That's not true.

468
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,041
He forced me. Bert threatened me.

469
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,132
Your husband's corpse is
fresh in the ground,

470
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,717
and here you are
stealing someone else's husband!

471
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:55,802
And you chose my husband!

472
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:59,430
He forced me. Bert threatened me.

473
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:01,015
Hold on. Wait a second.

474
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,392
My mother said she was not at fault.

475
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,769
Maybe…

476
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:07,897
Maybe it's really your husband's fault.

477
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:10,108
Father, is that true?

478
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:14,821
Mercy wanted what happened between us.

479
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,531
I didn't really want it, but

480
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:18,449
I'm just a man.

481
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,867
Excuse me.

482
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,536
Just a second.

483
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,871
My mother is not a liar,

484
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,706
so I'm sure that
if something happened here,

485
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,958
you took advantage of her!

486
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,751
You raped her! You're a rapist!

487
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,169
I will sue you!

488
00:35:30,253 --> 00:35:33,047
Sis, watch your words.
My father is not a rapist!

489
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:35,675
Maybe it was your mother
who went after my father!

490
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,844
You know, because she was mourning.

491
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,096
She was sad. She had an itch to scratch.

492
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,265
George, wait.

493
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,767
George, my mother is the victim here.

494
00:35:44,851 --> 00:35:45,852
Victim?

495
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:50,356
Isn't my mother the real victim here
because she's married to my father?

496
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:52,191
They love each other.

497
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:54,026
- And this woman destroyed it.
- Wait!

498
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,237
Don't hurt my mother.

499
00:35:57,780 --> 00:35:58,823
Stop it.

500
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,324
Then I'll hurt you instead.

501
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:21,387
We did take care of a snake in our house!

502
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:25,558
You're so thick-faced,
you and your mother!

503
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:27,101
You and your mother!

504
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:32,023
After we took you in, fed you,
and gave you a roof.

505
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,482
This is how you'll repay us?!

506
00:36:33,566 --> 00:36:36,277
We'd rather wander the streets
than stay in the same house

507
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,945
with your maniac father!

508
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,531
No, I'll sue you!

509
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,533
I'll have you jailed! You're a maniac!

510
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:45,661
Your neighbors should know that
you're a maniac! You're a rapist!

511
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:49,207
Really now? You don't even have a house.
How will you even pay for the lawyer?

512
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:54,629
Most likely they will use their bodies
because that's all they have.

513
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,172
Really, George?

514
00:36:56,923 --> 00:36:58,925
That's how you see us?

515
00:37:00,051 --> 00:37:00,927
See me?

516
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,012
Fine!

517
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,932
Defend your rapist, maniac father.

518
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:07,850
I will only fight for my mother.

519
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:09,936
Even if we die!

520
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:12,355
I'm not scared of you.

521
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,026
See you in court or see you in hell!

522
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:31,249
Hello, Attorney?

523
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,875
Can I talk to you?

524
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:36,128
I just want to consult you
about something.

525
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,171
It's rape.

526
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:39,966
Okay…

527
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,426
just call me if I can talk to you.

528
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:43,552
Thank you.

529
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:46,430
- Sam…
- Mother, no!

530
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:48,599
Why are you scared?

531
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,768
Mother, look at me.
You're the one who was abused here.

532
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,061
Don't be scared.

533
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:54,605
He's an animal! He'll pay for this.

534
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,440
It'll be a scandal.

535
00:37:56,524 --> 00:37:58,567
Let's just keep quiet.

536
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,529
Also, George is your friend.

537
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:02,989
Mother, if she was a real friend,

538
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,741
she wouldn't have tolerated
what her father did.

539
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,952
I will defend you. Fight, Mother.

540
00:38:08,035 --> 00:38:09,078
Don't be scared.

541
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,080
Mother!

542
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,665
Mother, is what Sam said true?

543
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,166
Is it true that Bert did that to you?

544
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:16,961
That bastard! He's a jerk!

545
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,921
- I'll make him pay!
- Francis!

546
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,381
Francis!

547
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,552
You're such a sleaze.

548
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:29,223
You always humiliate me
even here in our home!

549
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,100
Mother, stop it.

550
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,645
It's not my fault.

551
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:37,356
She seduced me!

552
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,733
I got tempted!

553
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,610
Father, tell me the truth.

554
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:44,530
Did Auntie Mercy really come onto you?

555
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,407
You really didn't rape her?

556
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:47,575
What?

557
00:38:48,284 --> 00:38:51,954
You would rather believe them
over me, your own father?

558
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:56,208
You're too much, George!

559
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,588
Do you think I am capable
of what they're accusing me of?

560
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,382
Go ahead!

561
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,134
Gang up on me!

562
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,556
I just want to hear the truth
from your mouth.

563
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:15,311
But, you know,

564
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,729
the truth is

565
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:19,023
that Sam and Mercy are envious of us.

566
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:21,484
They want to steal your father from us.

567
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,861
They're so ungrateful!

568
00:39:25,946 --> 00:39:27,698
Hey, Bert, come out, you fool!

569
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,784
Come out! Hey!

570
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:31,327
Bert, come out!

571
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,791
Bert, come out!

572
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,209
Bert!

573
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,670
Hey! Who's there?

574
00:39:41,754 --> 00:39:42,922
Bert!

575
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,716
Bert, come out!

576
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:48,511
Bert, come out!

577
00:39:52,348 --> 00:39:55,309
- What did you do to my mother, huh?!
- Francis, don't make a scene here!

578
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,977
Get out of here if you don't want trouble.

579
00:39:57,937 --> 00:39:59,522
Don't hurt my husband!

580
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,648
George!

581
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:06,946
Stop that, Francis!

582
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:09,949
- What now?
- Don't!

583
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,159
Francis, what's with you?!

584
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,495
You're a jerk, old man. Stand up!

585
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,083
Hey!

586
00:40:19,166 --> 00:40:20,835
Francis!

587
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,676
Bert!

588
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:29,885
Father!

589
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:33,264
Bert!

590
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:38,352
- Father! Oh!
- Bert! Oh, Bert! Bert!

591
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,645
- Father!
- Bert!

592
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,771
Father!

593
00:40:40,855 --> 00:40:41,897
Father!

594
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:44,692
- Bert! Bert! Bert!
- Father, wake up! Wake up!

595
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,570
Help! Help, please!

596
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:48,988
Call an ambulance!

597
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,448
Father, wake up.

598
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:53,033
- George, George, George!
- Father!

599
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,786
- Call an ambulance, please!
- Father, wake up.

600
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,371
Bert! Bert!

601
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:00,458
- Please, wake up!
- Call an ambulance, please!

602
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,209
Father, wake up please!

603
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:00,643
George…

604
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,732
What are you doing here?

605
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:09,777
Do you want to make sure that
my father is dead?

606
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,655
George, believe it or not…

607
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:17,117
I'm here to sympathize with you.

608
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:22,456
When my father died,
you were there to grieve with me.

609
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,377
Sam, this is my father's wake.

610
00:42:27,336 --> 00:42:30,297
It's your fault that Father is dead.

611
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:32,758
George, Uncle Bert had a heart attack.
It was no one's fault.

612
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:35,135
It was because of your family!

613
00:42:35,719 --> 00:42:38,722
Nothing will change
if we blame each other.

614
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,766
The truth is,

615
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:43,310
I'm here because

616
00:42:44,687 --> 00:42:48,482
I am hoping that
we can mend our friendship.

617
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,943
George,

618
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:55,864
whatever misunderstandings
our parents had,

619
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,326
let's not be affected by that.

620
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:03,122
Are we going to throw away
our relationship, George?

621
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:05,124
George…

622
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,127
Everything's a mess, Sam.

623
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:12,339
Because Father is gone.

624
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,091
He's gone.

625
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:17,052
- George…
- My father is gone.

626
00:43:46,123 --> 00:43:49,585
You're so shameless, coming here!

627
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,629
Are you asking
to follow Bert into the next life?

628
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,214
Really, George?

629
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,800
You're going to patch things up
with this woman?

630
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:01,805
Her family is the reason
your father is gone.

631
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:05,267
- Auntie…
- Get out of here!

632
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,228
- Mother, please don't.
- Get out!

633
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:11,148
Get out of here!

634
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,860
Get out.

635
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,221
My goodness, Sam.
Why did you even go there?

636
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:44,682
You knew that there would be trouble.

637
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:47,101
Mother, I just wanted
to offer my sympathy.

638
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,853
I wanted to be a good friend to George.

639
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,398
Sam, George is not a real friend.

640
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:55,109
Didn't you see how she belittled us?

641
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,862
She even took her rapist father's side!

642
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,907
And Sam.

643
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,159
She's the daughter of the person
who assaulted Mother.

644
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,538
Wasn't she your crush once?

645
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,206
That was before.

646
00:45:09,957 --> 00:45:11,708
Let's just avoid her.

647
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:12,960
All of them.

648
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,629
Yes.

649
00:45:16,713 --> 00:45:19,216
Let's just focus on us.

650
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,009
On our family.

651
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:23,011
It's not yet too late.

652
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:26,223
Even if your father is gone,

653
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,143
we're still together.

654
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:33,689
You're right, Mother.

655
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:36,650
I'll just focus on the three of us.

656
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:40,487
I'll also focus on work

657
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:44,158
so we can transfer to our new house.

658
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,169
- This is it?
- This is it.

659
00:45:55,252 --> 00:45:58,172
- It's beautiful, Sam.
- Is it?

660
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:02,092
This is the first time we've had this
fixed, right? It should be beautiful.

661
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,427
- Hey, you're too harsh.
- It's nice.

662
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,762
- It was worth the wait.
- It was.

663
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:09,099
Everything we dreamed of
is inside our house.

664
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:10,976
Wow, Sam. It's beautiful.

665
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:14,646
But before we go in,
I have a surprise for you.

666
00:46:14,730 --> 00:46:16,523
- What is it?
- What is it?

667
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:19,109
Outside, just over here.

668
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:29,328
So that even though Papa is gone,
it's like he's still with us.

669
00:46:32,998 --> 00:46:36,210
Maybe we should go in now
before Mother cries.

670
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,544
- What do you say?
- Let's check my room.

671
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:39,505
- I'm excited already.
- Do you want to see it? Hurry, let's go!

672
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:41,965
Come on, let's do that later.

673
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,551
Let's come in.

674
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,094
Are you ready?

675
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:49,473
- You should close your eyes first.
- Here we go.

676
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:52,684
- Wait a second. Over here.
- They're closed already.

677
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,977
- Still closed.
- Are you ready now?

678
00:46:54,061 --> 00:46:55,729
- We're ready.
- We're very ready.

679
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:57,481
- Come in.
- Can we go now?

680
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:59,566
- Keep covering your eyes.
- Is it okay to open them now?

681
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,151
Here!

682
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,694
- Yeah!
- Wow!

683
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,404
It's beautiful!

684
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:08,242
So our dining room is here,
and then the kitchen, the living room…

685
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,410
Mother, be careful in the kitchen.

686
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:13,163
Do you want to see your room?

687
00:47:13,247 --> 00:47:14,414
- It's upstairs. Hurry!
- Okay, let's go.

688
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:15,499
Francis, hurry!

689
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:17,668
- Francis?
- Hold on.

690
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:19,378
What's wrong?

691
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:22,673
- Francis!
- Francis, what's wrong?

692
00:47:22,756 --> 00:47:25,592
- Francis, are you okay?
- Francis!

693
00:47:26,301 --> 00:47:28,762
- My son!
- Francis, what's happening?

694
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,057
Francis!

695
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:34,309
What?

696
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:36,728
You have lung cancer?

697
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:37,980
Since when?

698
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:39,856
Almost a year.

699
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,692
Almost a year?

700
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,278
You've been hiding this from us, Francis?

701
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,530
I didn't want you to worry.

702
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:49,408
We were busy with building our house.

703
00:47:49,491 --> 00:47:51,326
I didn't want to add to our problems.

704
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,704
Francis, this is not just
a simple cough or cold.

705
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:56,915
This is cancer.
Why did you hide this from us?

706
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,292
Doc…

707
00:47:58,375 --> 00:47:59,960
can my son be cured?

708
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,838
Well, he needs to start treatment
right away.

709
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,382
A lot of time has been wasted.

710
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:07,301
Thank you, Doc.

711
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:13,307
- Francis…
- I don't want to have chemo.

712
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:18,895
I've read that my body will become weak
if I have that.

713
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:22,149
Francis, you need to be treated.

714
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:25,152
You need to remove the cancer cells
in your body.

715
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:27,195
Everyone dies eventually.

716
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,156
I'll just go ahead first.

717
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,366
Francis, don't say that.

718
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:33,410
Don't say that!

719
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:37,247
You will live! You have to fight!

720
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:39,124
Do you want that?

721
00:48:39,207 --> 00:48:40,834
Mama crying?

722
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:43,003
You have to fight.

723
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,214
Mother.

724
00:48:46,298 --> 00:48:48,842
Mother, don't cry.

725
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:53,680
I don't want to be a burden to you.

726
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,099
I'm the man.

727
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:59,019
I should be taking care of you.

728
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,648
But with this, I feel like I'm useless.

729
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,525
Francis.

730
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,031
Francis, we're a family.

731
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,701
We need to help each other.

732
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,495
We're a family.

733
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,873
We have no money left.

734
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:23,085
It'd be fine if I only needed
one cycle of chemo.

735
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,129
But what about the second cycle
and the ones after?

736
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,506
How can we manage that, Sam?

737
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,342
Don't think about that.

738
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,469
I'll take care of it.

739
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,554
Just get well.

740
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:38,934
I have an upcoming project.
I'll be getting a huge commission from it.

741
00:49:39,017 --> 00:49:42,396
As for you, just get well.

742
00:49:43,063 --> 00:49:46,983
After that, you can take care
of Mama and me.

743
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,902
Is that okay?

744
00:49:51,071 --> 00:49:52,989
- Get well.
- Thank you.

745
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:54,616
Thank you.

746
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,050
Ma'am!

747
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:14,177
Ma'am, you're taking me
out of the project?

748
00:50:14,261 --> 00:50:16,263
But it was I who closed the deal.

749
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:19,391
I'm sorry, Sam,
but those were Mrs. Tan's orders.

750
00:50:19,474 --> 00:50:24,104
She wants a different interior designer
to lead the renovation of the house.

751
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:27,566
But did she say
why she wanted me replaced?

752
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,526
I'm sorry.

753
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,569
Ma'am, excuse me.

754
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:32,195
Yes, what's that?

755
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,240
- This one, ma'am.
- Okay, I'll get this. Thank you.

756
00:50:36,283 --> 00:50:37,617
Bestie!

757
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:39,035
Did you hear that?

758
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,746
I will be replaced in the project?

759
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:43,999
It's just weird.
Last night, Mrs. Tan and I were okay.

760
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,127
She was even sending me her ideas.
What could have happened?

761
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,920
Keep this quiet, okay?

762
00:50:49,004 --> 00:50:51,715
It wasn't Mrs. Tan who wanted you out.

763
00:50:51,798 --> 00:50:53,717
It was the woman she was with.

764
00:50:54,676 --> 00:50:57,053
It was like she was destroying
your reputation.

765
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,263
Who was she with?

766
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:01,183
Actually, they just left.

767
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:04,728
- Just a second.
- Hey, wait!

768
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,396
Wait, bestie!

769
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,773
Where?

770
00:51:07,856 --> 00:51:09,483
There, bestie. Hold on.

771
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:10,984
Hold on.

772
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,569
- There's Mrs. Tan, bestie.
- We might still catch her.

773
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:13,695
Mrs. Tan!

774
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,450
That's her! That's the one
destroying your reputation.

775
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:23,330
I even heard her saying
your family is immoral or something.

776
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:25,582
Not that I believe her.

777
00:51:25,665 --> 00:51:27,793
Who is that woman?

778
00:51:27,876 --> 00:51:29,127
Do you know her?

779
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,849
- Let's celebrate.
- Of course.

780
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:50,649
- Cheers!
- Here's to us.

781
00:51:53,568 --> 00:51:54,986
Delicious.

782
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,739
Go, Mother. Tell me everything.

783
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,990
So here's the story.

784
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:03,829
When I found out that Mrs. Tan
had chosen Sam as the interior designer,

785
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:04,996
I told her directly.

786
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,291
I said that her mother
was your father's mistress

787
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,002
and that Sam even tolerated
her mother's cheating.

788
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:12,712
And then?

789
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,006
And then I told her
to go ahead and hire Sam,

790
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,509
but we would no longer buy
pieces of jewelry from her.

791
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:18,802
So she agreed not to.

792
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:21,012
Goodbye, Sam!

793
00:52:23,265 --> 00:52:24,891
Too bad.

794
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:28,228
How I wish I'd seen Sam's reaction.

795
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:32,524
She will slowly lose everything
that's important to her.

796
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,902
Just like our family did
thanks to her family.

797
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:43,451
George, what will happen to us?
Father is gone.

798
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,998
Don't worry, Ward. I'm still here.

799
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:50,584
I will be your sister and father
at the same time.

800
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:52,586
Is that okay?

801
00:52:54,379 --> 00:52:55,755
Anybody home?

802
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,049
There's a letter for Bert Balay.

803
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,426
I'll get it.

804
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:09,477
Ma'am, there's a letter for Bert Balay.

805
00:53:09,561 --> 00:53:11,062
He's gone already.

806
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:13,523
Kindly receive this from the bank.

807
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,401
Just fill this out.

808
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:23,491
Thank you.

809
00:53:37,255 --> 00:53:38,924
What's that, George?

810
00:53:39,007 --> 00:53:41,259
Mother, did Father take out a loan?

811
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:43,929
I have no idea, George.

812
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,682
If we fail to pay them,
the bank will foreclose on our house.

813
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:07,494
<i>We didn't only lose Father, Mother.</i>

814
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:11,456
We lost everything
that our family had achieved.

815
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,415
You know,

816
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:15,669
there's only one root cause
of all of this.

817
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,712
Sam's family.

818
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,924
Every time I think about
everything we lost,

819
00:54:21,007 --> 00:54:22,801
I'm fuming mad with her.

820
00:54:22,884 --> 00:54:25,971
At least our lives are
slowly bouncing back, Mother.

821
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,390
Right.

822
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,312
George, this is delicious.

823
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:38,984
Delicious.

824
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,701
What are you ladies giggling about?

825
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:51,079
Excuse me, Mother. Wife duties.

826
00:54:52,622 --> 00:54:53,581
Well…

827
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,375
The usual.

828
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:57,210
Just gossip.

829
00:54:57,293 --> 00:54:59,421
I'm just making the most
of my time with my daughter

830
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:02,674
because you'll be gone for a long time
for your honeymoon.

831
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:05,844
Three months?

832
00:55:05,927 --> 00:55:07,012
Maybe more.

833
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,347
That will depend on George.

834
00:55:09,431 --> 00:55:12,058
And I hope when we return,
it'll be the three of us.

835
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,227
George, my coat, please.

836
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:16,855
Here you go.

837
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:17,939
Okay.

838
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:21,359
I'll just take a shower and follow soon.

839
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:23,111
You have a lot to pack.

840
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:24,612
- Okay.
- Yeah.

841
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:25,655
- I'll leave you, ladies.
- Okay.

842
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:26,948
See you later.

843
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:33,621
George, do your best on your honeymoon.

844
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,248
I'm excited to have a grandchild.

845
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:37,250
Of course, Mother.

846
00:55:37,959 --> 00:55:42,672
Because once Basil and I have a baby,
our future will be secured.

847
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:45,675
Even if he divorces me,

848
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:50,263
there will be support
for our baby Palacios.

849
00:55:50,972 --> 00:55:53,725
You know, the saying is true.

850
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:57,270
Blessed are those who are oppressed.

851
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:00,982
Good thing you married a rich guy.

852
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,734
Of course, Mother.

853
00:56:02,817 --> 00:56:04,861
I made sure of that

854
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:07,947
so we could get revenge quickly on Sam.

855
00:56:08,364 --> 00:56:09,908
And to that, another cheers.

856
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:12,160
Cheers!

857
00:56:17,373 --> 00:56:18,208
George?

858
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,085
Go follow him.

859
00:56:21,002 --> 00:56:21,878
- Okay, Mother.
- Yes, go now.

860
00:56:21,961 --> 00:56:23,588
Go.

861
00:56:23,671 --> 00:56:25,215
Okay.

862
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:32,305
Cheers!

863
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:36,351
Yes, sir. Did you receive
my design portfolio?

864
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:42,065
Oh, is that so, sir?

865
00:56:42,148 --> 00:56:43,608
Okay.

866
00:56:43,691 --> 00:56:47,237
If you have renovation projects
or interior design projects,

867
00:56:47,320 --> 00:56:49,614
just let me know, sir.

868
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:50,865
Thank you.

869
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:06,589
Francis?

870
00:57:08,341 --> 00:57:10,593
What's that? Are you smoking?

871
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:13,513
- Sam, wait, I just lit it.
- No!

872
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:14,722
- You're sick, aren't you?
- What's with you?

873
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:18,393
Will you let your disease
get to stage 4 cancer before you stop?

874
00:57:18,476 --> 00:57:21,438
Come on, it's just to help me relax
so I can get to sleep, Sam.

875
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:24,983
We've already talked about this
and told you to stop it!

876
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,693
What did you tell me?

877
00:57:26,776 --> 00:57:29,362
That you don't want to be a burden, right?
That you want to take care of us.

878
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:31,322
How will you do that
if you keep on smoking?

879
00:57:31,406 --> 00:57:34,951
Sam, don't scold your brother anymore.
You already know that he's sick.

880
00:57:35,034 --> 00:57:38,580
But, Ma, only Francis can help himself.

881
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:42,876
Francis, will you waste all the effort
and money we've spent on your treatment?

882
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:43,835
Is that the problem?

883
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:45,753
Fine, once I have money,
I will pay you back!

884
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,547
Goodness! That's not my point, Francis.

885
00:57:47,630 --> 00:57:49,841
What I'm saying is
we're having a difficult time.

886
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:52,135
And yet you're still smoking!
You won't give that vice up!

887
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,970
It's not his fault.

888
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:57,932
The doctor explained that
he has depression.

889
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:02,437
He took your father's death badly.

890
00:58:03,938 --> 00:58:08,109
Mother, that's not an excuse
to destroy his life.

891
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:13,698
You don't know what happens
when one has depression.

892
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:15,825
If someone is sad,

893
00:58:15,909 --> 00:58:21,706
they will do anything to feel better,
even if it's wrong.

894
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,751
- Even if it's wrong.
- Stop it. You don't have to explain.

895
00:58:24,834 --> 00:58:27,504
No matter how you explain it to her,
she will not understand.

896
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:30,131
She's the only one not affected
by Papa's death.

897
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,799
What, Francis?

898
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:33,092
Kindly repeat that.

899
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:34,844
I am not affected?

900
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:37,096
Is that it? Is that what you said?

901
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,806
Wow!

902
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:40,391
Sorry.

903
00:58:40,475 --> 00:58:43,478
Sorry if you think
I'm not affected by Papa's death.

904
00:58:43,561 --> 00:58:44,938
Sorry if I'm always busy with work.

905
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,439
Sorry!

906
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,317
Sorry if I don't have time to have vices
or have a boyfriend.

907
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,779
Sorry because I'm busy solving
all of the problems Papa left behind.

908
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,073
Sorry if I don't have time to cry.

909
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,617
I have no time to be weak

910
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,537
because if I fall apart,
what will happen to us?

911
00:59:00,620 --> 00:59:04,040
We are already drowning, and the more
we do this, the deeper we will sink.

912
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:27,105
Stop smoking, Francis.

913
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:15,653
Why is it like this, Pa?

914
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,616
I thought that as time passed,

915
01:00:20,325 --> 01:00:22,744
I would feel better.

916
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:26,956
But why is it still so heavy?

917
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,584
It hurts so much.

918
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:37,759
If you were here, I'd have an ally.

919
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:40,678
I'd have someone on my side.

920
01:00:42,972 --> 01:00:45,475
Now I'm all alone, Pa.

921
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:48,936
It's difficult.

922
01:00:49,437 --> 01:00:53,566
It's hard to feel like
you don't have any allies, Pa.

923
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:57,755
Our work will be done after two days,
so we can turn it over to you.

924
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:58,881
Good job.

925
01:01:58,965 --> 01:02:01,551
- Good job, Sam.
- Thank you, sir.

926
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:03,052
We need to be on schedule.

927
01:02:03,136 --> 01:02:06,889
- Thank you again for the opportunity, sir.
- No problem.

928
01:02:06,973 --> 01:02:08,558
You can walk with Sir.

929
01:02:20,111 --> 01:02:21,112
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Thank you.

930
01:02:31,122 --> 01:02:38,129
Michael, can you get the other jar there?
The colorful one, please?

931
01:02:44,469 --> 01:02:47,180
I'm sorry. I thought you were
my staff. I'm sorry.

932
01:02:47,263 --> 01:02:50,433
It's okay. I can be your staff for today.

933
01:02:50,516 --> 01:02:51,809
No, it's okay.

934
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,102
Thank you. I can do it.

935
01:02:53,186 --> 01:02:54,979
- Thank you.
- Okay then.

936
01:02:55,062 --> 01:02:56,689
What about this one?

937
01:02:57,607 --> 01:02:58,900
- Sure.
- Yeah.

938
01:02:58,983 --> 01:03:00,318
Thank you.

939
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:01,986
Okay.

940
01:03:04,822 --> 01:03:06,491
There you are.

941
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,619
So, you've met Sam?

942
01:03:09,702 --> 01:03:12,205
Yes. We've met…

943
01:03:13,414 --> 01:03:14,707
again.

944
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,167
Again?

945
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:18,586
Yeah, we've met before.

946
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,255
At the cemetery.

947
01:03:28,638 --> 01:03:30,223
You're that girl?

948
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,183
What do you mean by "that girl"?

949
01:03:32,266 --> 01:03:36,938
About five years ago,
Paco told me about your meeting.

950
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:41,484
His answers were a bit off,
so you talked back to him.

951
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,694
He couldn't forget that.

952
01:03:43,778 --> 01:03:46,155
It was the first time someone had
ever spoken back to him.

953
01:03:46,239 --> 01:03:48,533
No one has talked to Paco like that.

954
01:03:49,450 --> 01:03:51,786
Well, maybe I'm not like everyone.

955
01:03:52,537 --> 01:03:56,249
Small world, right? Meeting her here.

956
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:58,793
And I'm not acting like a cupid,

957
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:03,673
but maybe this is the best time for you
to get to know each other.

958
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,216
Paco is single,

959
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,009
and you are too, right?

960
01:04:09,595 --> 01:04:12,515
I'm sorry, but, sir, I'm really busy.

961
01:04:12,598 --> 01:04:13,474
- Yeah, right.
- Sorry.

962
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:15,518
But how about after work?

963
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,019
There's a bar downstairs.

964
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,897
I will be there at 7:00 p.m.

965
01:04:20,731 --> 01:04:23,150
Of course, no pressure.

966
01:04:24,777 --> 01:04:27,488
Sam, trust me.

967
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,824
This friend of mine is a good person.

968
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:32,285
If he two-times you,

969
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:35,746
I will make this Paco Palacios pay for it.

970
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:53,324
Hey, I'm busy. Come on.

971
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,993
- I need to finish this.
- I'll take care of that.

972
01:05:56,077 --> 01:05:58,955
Hey, I have to finish this today, okay?
I have a deadline.

973
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,456
- Don't worry.
- Where will you take that?

974
01:06:00,539 --> 01:06:02,708
I'll put this on your table later.
Come on.

975
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,001
- Oh, come on.
- Someone's waiting for you.

976
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,419
There!

977
01:06:10,925 --> 01:06:13,803
Go ahead. I'll take care of this.

978
01:06:15,304 --> 01:06:16,097
Paco?

979
01:06:16,764 --> 01:06:19,225
- Hey.
- What are you doing here?

980
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,810
I brought you coffee.

981
01:06:25,898 --> 01:06:28,192
- Thank you.
- Of course.

982
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:33,239
Orange…

983
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:37,618
It keeps…

984
01:06:39,161 --> 01:06:40,079
keeps switching.

985
01:06:40,162 --> 01:06:42,248
It just won't stand still.

986
01:06:45,876 --> 01:06:47,420
This is difficult.

987
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,590
Give me that.

988
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:52,925
It's not difficult.

989
01:06:53,009 --> 01:06:55,845
This is what's good about this.
It's challenging, right?

990
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,848
You think at first that
it's all messed up,

991
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,685
but with just a little patience

992
01:07:02,768 --> 01:07:05,646
and a carefully planned strategy,

993
01:07:06,522 --> 01:07:09,108
you'll be able to fix it.

994
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:16,741
Just like life.

995
01:07:24,540 --> 01:07:26,000
I have something for you.

996
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:34,800
What's this?

997
01:07:34,884 --> 01:07:36,302
Open it.

998
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:58,949
You don't like it?

999
01:08:02,787 --> 01:08:03,996
No.

1000
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,291
I like it. Thank you.

1001
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,877
You're not smiling,

1002
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:13,631
so I don't know if you appreciate it.

1003
01:08:14,965 --> 01:08:16,258
Sorry.

1004
01:08:18,302 --> 01:08:20,930
Ever since Papa died,

1005
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:23,182
it's difficult to smile.

1006
01:08:23,808 --> 01:08:27,353
The truth is, I can't remember
the last time I laughed.

1007
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:29,105
You know, real laughter.

1008
01:08:30,606 --> 01:08:31,774
Okay.

1009
01:08:33,901 --> 01:08:35,653
What?

1010
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,113
Nothing.

1011
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:40,116
You just gave me a new life goal.

1012
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,368
To make you smile.

1013
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:53,170
Can you take me to Santiago?

1014
01:08:53,254 --> 01:08:54,380
Why?

1015
01:08:55,464 --> 01:08:59,260
It's all just rocks and sand there.

1016
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:02,012
I'm just curious.

1017
01:09:02,805 --> 01:09:05,474
Papa worked there before.

1018
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:10,271
I just want to see
how he spent his last days.

1019
01:09:15,025 --> 01:09:17,611
If that's what will bring back your smile,

1020
01:09:19,697 --> 01:09:21,574
then your wish is my command.

1021
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:22,343
Welcome to our home.

1022
01:10:42,988 --> 01:10:46,617
Welcome, and yes,

1023
01:10:46,700 --> 01:10:48,827
it's a twin house.

1024
01:10:51,580 --> 01:10:52,623
This is our house,

1025
01:10:52,706 --> 01:10:55,876
and this one is my uncle's.

1026
01:10:57,294 --> 01:11:00,589
It's cheaper if you give one design
to the architect.

1027
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:03,133
Just kidding.

1028
01:11:03,217 --> 01:11:04,635
You might think that we're stingy.

1029
01:11:06,720 --> 01:11:09,848
It's my late grandfather's idea

1030
01:11:09,932 --> 01:11:12,017
to have a twin mansion.

1031
01:11:15,688 --> 01:11:17,648
He's a believer in symmetrical balance

1032
01:11:17,731 --> 01:11:19,525
like ying and yang,

1033
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:21,151
night and day,

1034
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:22,861
fire and ice,

1035
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:24,738
male, female.

1036
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,908
Double the mansion, double the trouble.

1037
01:11:44,174 --> 01:11:45,175
Morning, sir.

1038
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:46,135
Good day, sir.

1039
01:11:46,218 --> 01:11:47,636
Good day.

1040
01:11:47,720 --> 01:11:49,096
I'll just get something.

1041
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:54,310
Excuse.

1042
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,440
Get out of here.

1043
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,943
- What?
- This house has been cursed.

1044
01:13:26,026 --> 01:13:27,194
Get out!

1045
01:13:27,277 --> 01:13:30,114
- Save yourself or you will die.
- What?

1046
01:13:30,197 --> 01:13:32,116
You will die in this house!

1047
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,245
She's Sam Castillo, my girlfriend.

1048
01:13:36,328 --> 01:13:37,413
Pleased to meet you.

1049
01:13:37,496 --> 01:13:40,582
Hi, Sam. I've seen this kind
of bracelet before.

1050
01:13:40,666 --> 01:13:42,042
Are you serious with her?

1051
01:13:42,126 --> 01:13:44,962
I'm not dating for companionship.
I'm dating for marriage.

1052
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:47,005
You're not marrying that woman.

1053
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,383
Never! Not on my watch.

1054
01:13:49,466 --> 01:13:51,510
I will not let that woman hurt you again.

1055
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:55,472
You went through a lot
with that Sam Castillo.

1056
01:13:55,556 --> 01:13:56,849
I will not respect her.

1057
01:13:56,932 --> 01:14:01,478
Sir Paco's wife and Sir Basil's wife
have issues.

1058
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,771
- Let's make a bet.
- Okay, fine.

1059
01:14:02,855 --> 01:14:05,399
Which of the two daughters-in-law
will be the one who lasts?
