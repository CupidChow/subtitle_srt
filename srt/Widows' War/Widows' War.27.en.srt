1
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:51,384
What's wrong, Galvan?

2
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:53,636
I just received an email
from Dr. Dionela.

3
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,055
The DNA test result?

4
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:56,931
It's a negative. Peter is not a Palacios.

5
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,100
I already told you that, right?

6
00:00:59,184 --> 00:01:00,226
You were just being stubborn!

7
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,021
Once they catch Peter, I'll make him pay!

8
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:04,481
<i>You…</i>

9
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:05,565
<i>Peter?</i>

10
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:06,733
Peter!

11
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:09,235
<i>I specifically told you to leave</i>
<i>this area, didn't I?</i>

12
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,445
This is a crime scene.

13
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:11,863
You shouldn't have come near this place.

14
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:14,616
You have possibly muddled
or contaminated this area.

15
00:01:14,699 --> 00:01:15,950
Did they catch Peter?

16
00:01:16,034 --> 00:01:18,036
- Is he in jail?
- Pa, Peter is already dead.

17
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,245
Good for him.

18
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:22,415
Ma, even if Peter was a thief,
he was still a Palacios.

19
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:24,250
He was not a Palacios.

20
00:01:24,334 --> 00:01:26,294
Peter is dead.

21
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:27,670
What?

22
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,506
Someone attacked him.

23
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:31,674
Someone hit his head.

24
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:33,259
I feel guilty because
this wouldn't have happened

25
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:37,138
if we'd told them that
you were Papa's missing son.

26
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:41,184
There's only one new Palacios.
Sam's future child.

27
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,102
No, you're wrong, Auntie Aurora.

28
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,606
Everything Peter said
about Papa and Jessica is true.

29
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:48,566
Peter was the only fake part
of that story.

30
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:49,651
The DNA result.

31
00:01:49,734 --> 00:01:50,819
Jerico?

32
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,987
What? God!

33
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:55,198
Another helper?

34
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,407
Good evening.

35
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,159
Sergeant Emil Royales.

36
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:01,287
So, what is a Royales doing here?

37
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,164
I'm the new lead investigator,

38
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:07,418
and we are here because we have a lead
on what happened to Mr. Peter Pambid.

39
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:09,379
It happens to be a robbery gone wrong.

40
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,589
Peter must have wanted
to hide at the mine,

41
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,591
but someone tried to rob him.

42
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,053
The thief was robbed by another thief.

43
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,764
Peter didn't just steal
Basil's collection of watches.

44
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:21,850
He also stole Jerico's identity.

45
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:25,353
Jerico is the real Palacios.

46
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,856
I am the real son of Rodolfo Palacios.

47
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,566
I'm sure you're only after one thing.

48
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:32,610
- Money.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

49
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,154
I didn't come here for money,

50
00:02:34,237 --> 00:02:35,905
so please don't compare me to you.

51
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:37,782
And what do you mean by that?

52
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:39,409
Are you saying I'm only after the money?

53
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,994
I will answer that, Vivian.

54
00:02:41,077 --> 00:02:42,871
Yes, you're only after the money.

55
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,038
And you, Jerico.

56
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,500
If you're not after the money,
what is it that you want?

57
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,751
Family.

58
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:52,213
PREVIOUSLY

59
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:01,472
Jerico.

60
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:03,975
Jerico.

61
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,479
Jerico, please wait!

62
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:19,324
Is what you said true?

63
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,410
You're here to find your family?

64
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,582
I have a strong suspicion
that Papa is alive.

65
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:30,877
There's a reason why he didn't
come back for me and Mama.

66
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,964
When I opened the coffin in the mausoleum,
it was empty.

67
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:38,509
What really happened to Papa?

68
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:41,888
We…

69
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,892
We never found his body.

70
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,604
When his sailboat sunk into the sea,

71
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,149
we tried our very best to find him.

72
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,401
But we didn't get anything.

73
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,863
The empty coffin that you saw,

74
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,574
that's just our way to honor his memory.

75
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:05,787
Thank you, sir.

76
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:10,041
Now I know why Papa never came back to us.

77
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:13,920
Finally, I can be at peace.

78
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,090
That's it?

79
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:18,925
You're leaving?

80
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,805
You already answered my questions.

81
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:25,765
God!

82
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:29,394
You sound exactly like Rodolfo.

83
00:04:29,477 --> 00:04:31,437
Every time he'd introduce a woman,

84
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:34,440
whether it's Emily, Jessica,
or someone else.

85
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,818
You know,

86
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,071
your dad used to be
quite the charmer, Jerico.

87
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:42,699
He used to be very good-looking.

88
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:45,785
And that's exactly what he used to say.

89
00:04:46,577 --> 00:04:49,455
"It's up to you
if you'll accept her or not."

90
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:53,459
Did you accept my mother?

91
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,218
Because she was not rich?

92
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,847
Because she was not well-educated?

93
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,683
Just like me.

94
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,188
We made a lot of mistakes with Jessica,

95
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,232
especially Aurora.

96
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,027
A true-blooded queen bee.

97
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:23,197
But maybe we can make up for it
with her son.

98
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:27,618
With our nephew.

99
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:59,776
Bro, who would've thought that
Jerico was my cousin?

100
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:03,196
Now it makes sense.

101
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,158
That's why he's close to Rebecca.

102
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:13,414
Jerico worked here
so he could get to know his real family.

103
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,584
But why didn't he tell
the truth right away?

104
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,920
You've seen my family.

105
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:20,588
They're so intimidating.

106
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,799
Even with Mommy and I,

107
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,427
it took us how many years before
they let us live at the estate?

108
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,263
But even now,

109
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:32,183
I feel like I'm an outsider.

110
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:35,603
That's possible.

111
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:40,358
Maybe Jerico was just testing the waters

112
00:06:40,441 --> 00:06:43,820
as to whether he would be
accepted or not.

113
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,156
No, it's still weird.

114
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,493
Why did it take him so long
to reveal his identity?

115
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,996
Could it be that he needed more time?

116
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,540
More time for what?

117
00:06:56,082 --> 00:06:58,126
For his other plans.

118
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:03,047
In mystery novels, people who are
hiding something have plans.

119
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,049
Whatever those plans are,

120
00:07:05,508 --> 00:07:06,843
they are usually…

121
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:09,095
lethal.

122
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:20,356
Galvan easily moved on, didn't he?

123
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:29,949
Jerico replaced Peter right away.

124
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,660
I don't see anything wrong with that,

125
00:07:32,743 --> 00:07:35,746
especially if Jerico is a real Palacios.

126
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:38,875
He deserves to be accepted
and loved in this family,

127
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,293
just like your own daughter.

128
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,880
My daughter doesn't have secrets.

129
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,883
But that Jerico?

130
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,427
I'm sure he has secrets.

131
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:52,054
Aren't you just being suspicious, Vivian?

132
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,516
George…

133
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:59,645
Every Palacios is hiding something.

134
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,315
And that Jerico,

135
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,609
more likely than not,

136
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:07,612
has a secret that
he doesn't want to be exposed.

137
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:15,578
And aren't you curious
to find out what that is?

138
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,351
Hurry up, Amando.

139
00:08:38,726 --> 00:08:40,937
Call the DNA testing center.

140
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,272
I need to know

141
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:47,109
if Jerico is another scammer among us.

142
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:48,694
I'll take care of it, madam.

143
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:53,658
What if

144
00:08:54,909 --> 00:08:58,955
I have all our staff's DNA tested,

145
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:04,418
rather than having someone announce that
he or she is a Palacios every week?

146
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:07,213
Ma, calm down.

147
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:11,842
Aren't you happy that there's an addition
to your relatives?

148
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,265
There's only one Palacios
that I'm excited to meet, Sam,

149
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:19,517
and that is Paco's baby.

150
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,476
Your baby.

151
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,398
When is your next checkup?
I'll go with you.

152
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,733
There's no need, Ma. It's okay.

153
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,652
No, Sam.

154
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,321
Pregnancy is not one woman's job.

155
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:36,075
You need to be with someone.
You need a partner.

156
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,203
Your husband may be gone,

157
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,914
but I am here for you, my child.

158
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:47,420
"My child"?

159
00:09:50,298 --> 00:09:52,675
Are rich people really like that?

160
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:54,010
Someone will suddenly show up

161
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:57,013
and introduce themselves
as their relative?

162
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:58,556
You're right about that.

163
00:09:59,348 --> 00:10:01,142
First, it was Beverly,

164
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:04,061
claiming she was carrying Basil's child.

165
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,231
Then it was that Peter.

166
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,191
And now, it's Jerico.

167
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,237
Right?

168
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,073
Beverly…

169
00:10:16,157 --> 00:10:17,325
Peter…

170
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:21,662
Why?

171
00:10:23,664 --> 00:10:27,001
When Beverly said she was having
a baby with Basil,

172
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,794
someone killed her.

173
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:32,173
And then, when Peter claimed
that he was a Palacios,

174
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:34,091
someone also killed him.

175
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,014
Did you call me your child?

176
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:46,937
You are Paco's wife.

177
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:50,316
You're the mother of my future grandchild.

178
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:54,654
What will I call you then?

179
00:10:56,364 --> 00:10:57,740
It would be "my child," right?

180
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:26,018
Sergeant Royales said Peter was robbed.

181
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,313
But, Mother, all of them died.

182
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:31,649
George…

183
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:34,568
are we thinking the same thing?

184
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:36,987
Could this place be cursed?

185
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,572
Hey!

186
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,574
Are you getting close with Rebecca?

187
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,827
You're getting infected by her crazy ways.

188
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,078
There's no curse!

189
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:47,289
There are just people who are greedy
and act like demons.

190
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:50,292
But Ward has a point, Mother.

191
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,587
People are getting killed
here at the estate.

192
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:54,964
It's a problem.

193
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,091
And Abdul is not around.

194
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,760
Hey, don't think about Abdul.

195
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:03,139
It's a good thing that
he is no longer assigned here.

196
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,683
That's one less thing for you
to have to worry about.

197
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:07,435
You're right, George.

198
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,770
But what do you think, Mother?

199
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,691
With all the people getting
killed here at the estate,

200
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:15,734
who could've killed them?

201
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,459
Thank you so much.

202
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,752
I will relay it to the Palacios family.

203
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,923
Amando.

204
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,924
Sir.

205
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:41,177
Who were you talking to?

206
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,972
It's Dr. Chua, sir.

207
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:48,267
Jerico signed a release form

208
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:52,396
so anyone can verify that
he went through DNA matching.

209
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:54,815
Sir,

210
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,526
he is a Palacios.

211
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:00,654
Auntie…

212
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:05,367
Papa's body went missing at sea.

213
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,705
I don't know if it's true.

214
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:12,124
I can't go home yet.

215
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,336
My mission in this family is not yet done.

216
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,552
Auntie, just a second.

217
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,832
Just as I expected.

218
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,219
Hello, Rosemarie? We need to talk.

219
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,389
About how we're going to announce
the news about Jerico to the public.

220
00:14:12,518 --> 00:14:13,894
Sir Galvan,

221
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:17,523
you will introduce Jerico to the public?

222
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:22,486
This family has suffered
long enough, Amando.

223
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,614
All of us have lost someone.

224
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,575
Especially me.

225
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:31,704
Maybe Jerico has been given to us
to replace what was lost.

226
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,749
It's time to celebrate

227
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,168
that we're having an addition
to the family,

228
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:42,298
with or without Aurora's approval.

229
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:46,343
Don't worry about your sister, sir.

230
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,096
She's happy that she'll have
a grandchild from Sam.

231
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:52,641
Good for her.

232
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,686
At least she and Sam are okay.

233
00:14:57,271 --> 00:15:00,816
It's a good thing that
one out of three will be gone.

234
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,235
Now I just have to worry about
the remaining two, Amando.

235
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,529
Will you throw out the Castillos?

236
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:06,864
But of course.

237
00:15:06,947 --> 00:15:10,367
<i>I'll just wait for Sam</i>
<i>to give birth to my grandchild.</i>

238
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:13,329
Right, Amando?

239
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,582
Sam and Aurora are okay?

240
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:39,980
Please don't hurt me.

241
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,610
I'm sorry.

242
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:45,611
I'm just paranoid.

243
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,488
I thought it was someone else.

244
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:48,948
Why are you here?

245
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:51,283
I just wanted to talk to you.

246
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:54,620
They say you are my cousin.

247
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,623
Are you one of the people
who doesn't like me?

248
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:00,334
Of course not!

249
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:02,795
Why would I hate you, Jerico?

250
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:06,423
We're both… well…

251
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:07,883
Illegitimate children?

252
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:09,426
Isn't it unfair?

253
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,472
It's not our choice who are parents are,

254
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,642
but yet the world blames us
for being bastards.

255
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,772
Why do we always have to work hard
to impress people

256
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,857
who don't completely accept us?

257
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:34,660
Because you're worrying about whether
the Palacios family will like you.

258
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:38,247
What you should be asking yourself

259
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,457
is do you like them?

260
00:16:43,085 --> 00:16:44,461
Do you want to accept them?

261
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,007
How about you, Jerico?

262
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:51,677
Do you want to accept the Palacios family?

263
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,179
Jerico.

264
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,889
Galvan is looking for you.

265
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,684
You are needed for your pictorial.

266
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,271
Go.

267
00:17:07,609 --> 00:17:10,487
That guy is so lucky.

268
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,115
He is getting VIP treatment.

269
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:17,119
He already has a press conference,
and now he's getting a pictorial too.

270
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:20,789
That's because he is a man, Ma.

271
00:17:21,582 --> 00:17:23,125
Just like Basil.

272
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:25,502
That's why he became
Dad's favorite right away.

273
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,337
No!

274
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,174
Even if he is a man,

275
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,759
you're the daughter

276
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,552
and he's just a nephew.

277
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,388
So you're more important
even if you're a woman.

278
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:38,098
Do you understand?

279
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:39,558
You know what, Mommy?

280
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,811
You're just the same
as Daddy and Auntie Aurora!

281
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,354
You're all judgmental!

282
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,148
Oh, shut up!

283
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,026
Hey!

284
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,570
Don't turn your back on me!

285
00:17:56,492 --> 00:17:57,493
Cairo!

286
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,746
What's happening at the other house?

287
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:05,751
I saw that Palacios Mining's
whole PR team is here.

288
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:07,586
It's Sir Galvan.

289
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:10,839
He is going to introduce
your new relative to the public.

290
00:18:29,691 --> 00:18:32,194
I called the whole PR team here.

291
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,863
They will take care of
your transformation.

292
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:40,953
And tomorrow, you will have your briefing
with the family lawyer.

293
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:43,622
There's no need for that, sir.

294
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,124
I'm also feeling shy.

295
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:46,625
I'm content with this.

296
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,045
You're one of us now.

297
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:55,300
The word "content" is not
in Palacios' vocabulary.

298
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:59,471
If Basil were here, he would support this.

299
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:02,474
Come on.

300
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:03,642
Come on.

301
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:15,737
Everyone, please welcome

302
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:19,032
my nephew, Jerico Palacios.

303
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,661
It's so nice to meet you, sir.

304
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:25,414
Oh my, you have the same eyes
as Sir Basil.

305
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,709
Hello.

306
00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:32,296
Rosemarie Geraldine,

307
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,923
kindly tell your team to pack up.

308
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:38,927
I'm shutting down
this PR stunt immediately.

309
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,598
Galvan and I just had a miscommunication.

310
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,641
Aurora, please, not here.

311
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:45,976
- It's embarrassing.
- Hurry up.

312
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,069
Have you really lost your mind, Galvan?

313
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,533
You're going to act without my approval?

314
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:05,162
Aren't you ashamed of your plan?

315
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:10,375
You're going to tell the public there's
a bastard in the Palacios family?

316
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,878
Bastard or not,

317
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:14,213
he is still our blood.

318
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,340
My God, Galvan!

319
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:19,843
Are you really that desperate
to replace Basil?

320
00:20:19,927 --> 00:20:23,722
And you will replace your son
with another helper?!

321
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,809
What did this guy finish?

322
00:20:27,893 --> 00:20:28,810
High school?

323
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,270
Elementary?

324
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,690
He is just a helper!

325
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:36,068
He was born a helper,

326
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,694
lived like a helper,

327
00:20:37,778 --> 00:20:40,530
and will die a helper!

328
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:47,871
God!

329
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:56,672
Aurora!

330
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:26,201
Papa and Jessica had a baby.
But it wasn't Peter.

331
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,995
What do you mean?

332
00:21:28,745 --> 00:21:31,331
That there's another Palacios?

333
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:33,375
We're really siblings.

334
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:35,919
Who's this sibling you're talking about?

335
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,713
Here, Uncle.

336
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,964
Jerico?

337
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,048
What?

338
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:41,591
God!

339
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,760
Another helper?

340
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,361
Aurora!

341
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,989
You know damn well that
we need a good story

342
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,993
to cover up all these murders
going on in our home.

343
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,039
The only good news we have, Galvan,

344
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:14,750
is the upcoming birth of my grandchild.

345
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,793
The child of Paco and Sam.

346
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,712
So if you're going to showcase someone,

347
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:20,005
it should be Sam,

348
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,049
not that pest, Jerico!

349
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,300
Oh, come on, Aurora.

350
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,635
Don't get me started on Sam.

351
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,888
I know that you're just trying
to be nice to Sam

352
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,015
because you want to get her baby!

353
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:34,603
You will throw Sam away
after she gives birth.

354
00:22:35,479 --> 00:22:36,605
What?

355
00:22:38,356 --> 00:22:39,733
Oops.

356
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:45,655
Jerico…

357
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,075
- Rebecca…
- Are you okay?

358
00:22:50,118 --> 00:22:52,412
I heard about what happened earlier.

359
00:22:54,664 --> 00:22:58,043
Right from the start,
they have looked down on me.

360
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,213
That will not change overnight.

361
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,965
Jerico, you know what?

362
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:07,177
Just give Auntie Aurora
a little more time, okay?

363
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,388
I'm sure she'll accept you as her nephew.

364
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:15,560
Rebecca, I didn't come here
to beg for their love.

365
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:18,647
Papa and you.

366
00:23:19,606 --> 00:23:22,692
You two are the reason
I'm still staying here.

367
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:25,320
I know, I know. Okay, wait.

368
00:23:26,404 --> 00:23:28,573
Let's light an incense, okay?

369
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:32,494
Because there is a lot
of bad energy today.

370
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:35,122
A lot of things have happened.
The mess, and…

371
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:36,832
Peter's murder.

372
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,046
What if…

373
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,381
we just both leave?

374
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,883
There's a place I know that we could go.

375
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,262
Just the two of us?

376
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:52,556
Yes. Just us.

377
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:54,099
I'm sure you'll enjoy it there.

378
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,936
Okay.

379
00:23:58,728 --> 00:23:59,729
You're okay with that?

380
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,023
- Game?
- Game.

381
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,734
- I'll just change to my rubber shoes.
- Okay.

382
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:11,992
Rubber shoes? Aren't they here?

383
00:24:23,753 --> 00:24:27,382
Ma, is that true?

384
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:29,634
Don't listen to him, my child.

385
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,261
Wow.

386
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,139
Now, you're calling her "my child".

387
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:38,393
You're really good
at manipulating people, Aurora.

388
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,145
Even Sam.

389
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:43,607
She actually believes that you love her.

390
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:47,777
Speak plainly, Uncle Galvan.

391
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:49,738
What do you mean?

392
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,368
Aurora's just waiting for you
to give birth.

393
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,080
Once she gets her grandchild,

394
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:01,666
you're out of this house.

395
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:03,168
Ask Amando.

396
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:08,256
He knows all about Aurora's grand plan

397
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,883
to get rid of you.

398
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,599
No.

399
00:25:19,059 --> 00:25:20,185
No.

400
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,521
You can't take my child away from me!

401
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,065
Sam.

402
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,233
Samantha!

403
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:31,321
We're not yet done, Galvan.

404
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,699
I'm just here. I'm waiting.

405
00:25:49,297 --> 00:25:50,465
No, those aren't the ones.

406
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:52,842
- They're old.
- Is that so?

407
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:53,885
I'll just use these.

408
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,804
Sir Galvan gave them to me.

409
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,056
- They're new. Look, come here.
- Just use them, Jerico.

410
00:25:58,139 --> 00:26:00,809
- They're beautiful because they're new.
- I'll just use these ones, all right?

411
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:02,894
- Those will look better on you.
- These will look better, right?

412
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:03,853
Yes.

413
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,314
Sam.

414
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,732
Sam!

415
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:09,276
Sam, wait.

416
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,444
Sam!

417
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:13,780
Sam, let's talk!

418
00:26:13,863 --> 00:26:15,240
What for?

419
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:16,866
So you can get my child?

420
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:19,536
You can't take my child away from me.

421
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,663
My child will grow up with me!

422
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,748
No one will take your child.

423
00:26:23,832 --> 00:26:26,835
No one will take your baby.
Galvan is lying.

424
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,878
He just wants to destroy the two of us.

425
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:31,715
Why would he want to do that?
What will he get from it?

426
00:26:31,798 --> 00:26:34,551
Because he is envious of me!

427
00:26:34,634 --> 00:26:35,927
Especially since…

428
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:39,097
I will have a grandchild, but he won't.

429
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,224
Okay.

430
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,059
Okay.

431
00:26:46,229 --> 00:26:47,897
So can you honestly tell me

432
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:51,359
that it never crossed your mind?

433
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:55,530
Did it never occur to you? Not even once?

434
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,491
I would be lying to you, Sam,

435
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,995
if I said

436
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:04,122
it had never crossed my mind.

437
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:09,044
I knew it.

438
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,549
I knew it!

439
00:27:16,259 --> 00:27:18,762
All the kindness you showed me

440
00:27:18,845 --> 00:27:20,555
was a lie!

441
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,017
Going with me to the hospital…

442
00:27:24,684 --> 00:27:26,936
Even calling me "my child"…

443
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,148
You did all of that to earn my trust

444
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:31,483
so I can be comfortable,

445
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,943
so you can betray me!

446
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:36,946
But that was before, Sam!

447
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,950
When I didn't know you well.

448
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,163
But when I called you my child,

449
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:46,581
I meant it.

450
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:52,962
I considered you like my own daughter.

451
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,965
The daughter I wanted, Sam.

452
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:59,803
Why would I believe you now?

453
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:04,307
If you can't accept Jerico,
who has turned out to be your relative,

454
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,976
how can you accept the woman
who is just the wife of your son?

455
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,230
That is precisely why!

456
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,609
You are Paco's wife! My son.

457
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:20,490
That's why I treated you like my child.

458
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:23,201
Why would I accept Jerico?

459
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:24,202
Why?

460
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:27,497
I won't get a grandchild from him.

461
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,790
No!

462
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,418
It's you!

463
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:38,967
You're the one with a Palacios in your
womb who carries Paco's blood,

464
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,845
and mine too.

465
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:48,643
I'm now afraid to believe you.

466
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:19,340
Sir Galvan really liked Jerico.

467
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:21,885
I mean, Sir Jerico, right?

468
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:23,720
I noticed it too.

469
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,556
All he talks about is Jerico.

470
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:30,393
He doesn't care about Peter's death.

471
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,938
But why waste time on Peter?

472
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:35,607
He's a thief,

473
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:38,401
and he's not even their relative.

474
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:42,864
Peter still became a part of this family.

475
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:46,326
He worked for our bosses
for several years.

476
00:29:46,409 --> 00:29:49,954
The least they could have done
was see that justice was done for him.

477
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:53,958
Even Ms. Beverly's murder
hasn't been solved yet.

478
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,086
But when Sir Basil died,

479
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:59,005
Francis was suddenly arrested.

480
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,926
Well, you know what they say.

481
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:05,428
Justice is swift

482
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:06,429
for the rich.

483
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:13,895
- Excuse me.
- Ma'am?

484
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:17,148
Sergeant Royales
wants to talk to you about Peter.

485
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,360
His phone number can't be reached anymore.

486
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:23,321
The buyer of the watches he stole.

487
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:27,325
I'm just wondering if you have any idea
who that person might have been?

488
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,703
Did Peter tell you anything about it?

489
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,165
I'm new here, Detective,

490
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,542
but from what I heard,

491
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:38,336
it's Jerico and Peter
who were really close.

492
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:43,508
Maybe it's better if you talk to Jerico.

493
00:30:43,591 --> 00:30:45,301
Maybe he can answer your questions.

494
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:56,437
- They're beautiful.
- Yes, they are.

495
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:57,814
That's great.

496
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,274
- They look good on you.
- Should we go now?

497
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,484
- Come on, let's go.
- Let's go.

498
00:31:13,705 --> 00:31:15,206
Okay, Attorney.

499
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:17,292
As long as she has no rights at all.

500
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,295
Okay, thank you.

501
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,548
Sam, what did the attorney say?

502
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:25,967
Is it possible for Ma'am Aurora
to get your child?

503
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,385
No, Mother.

504
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:28,553
Legally speaking,

505
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,972
only the mother has the right
to take care of her child.

506
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,850
What if she doesn't follow the law?

507
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:36,185
What if she suddenly takes your baby?

508
00:31:36,769 --> 00:31:38,980
She is rich and powerful.

509
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,357
Francis is already in prison.

510
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,777
I hope she won't take
my grandchild away from me.

511
00:31:47,322 --> 00:31:48,573
No, Mother.

512
00:31:49,782 --> 00:31:52,410
She won't take my baby from me.

513
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:54,287
Not even if we end up killing each other.

514
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,259
This is Jerico's room.

515
00:32:08,343 --> 00:32:11,179
Ever since Peter died,
he's been the only one using this.

516
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,223
Thank you, Ms. Georgina.

517
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:18,519
Peter's murder case will be solved swiftly
because of your cooperation.

518
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:23,232
We all want this investigation to end
so we can find out who killed him,

519
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,903
and so I can recover everything that
was stolen from my husband.

520
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,496
Jerico?

521
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:40,708
Jerico?

522
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,088
Jerico isn't here.

523
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:49,384
But, Sergeant Royales,
these are their beds.

524
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:53,096
This is Jerico's bed, and this is Peter's.

525
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,863
Sergeant Royales, look!

526
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,080
Good morning, sir.

527
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,457
Here's the key.

528
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,500
- Thank you, mister.
- I'll come back for it later.

529
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,585
Okay.

530
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,381
- Let's go.
- Jerico, whose house is this?

531
00:34:24,604 --> 00:34:27,648
Didn't you say that
the possible murder weapon

532
00:34:27,732 --> 00:34:28,733
used to kill Peter

533
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,902
was either a pipe or a baseball bat?

534
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:33,613
And why is there blood on it?

535
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,296
Jerico, who owns this house?

536
00:34:53,591 --> 00:34:54,550
It's Papa's.

537
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,346
How come I didn't know about this?

538
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,558
I found it in the old records
of the estate.

539
00:35:02,642 --> 00:35:04,852
Papa was still a bachelor
when he had this built.

540
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,938
That may be the reason why you don't know.

541
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:14,362
Well, who knows what memories of Papa
we can find here?

542
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,503
Can I also check the cabinet?

543
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:33,005
Yes, of course, Sergeant Royales.

544
00:35:46,310 --> 00:35:47,812
Oh my God!

545
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:57,613
Sam, what happened?
What did you do to Paco?

546
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,578
Basil!

547
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,456
Basil?

548
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,378
Beverly was killed?

549
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:15,214
But why is Papa accusing me?

550
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:17,091
George, they found your bracelet

551
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:19,844
on the path the killer took
when they escaped.

552
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,389
Peter?

553
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:37,528
Jerico is the killer?

554
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,953
Why is there a picture of Basil here?

555
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,830
Don't! That's evidence.

556
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,381
Oh my God.

557
00:37:00,134 --> 00:37:01,469
Yes, hello, Villa.

558
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:04,096
Villa, send some men here
to the Palacios' Estate.

559
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:07,683
We might have a clue who the killer is.

560
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,153
SOCO arrived?

561
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:24,450
Ma'am, the sergeant saw some things
inside Jerico's room.

562
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,869
And from what I heard,

563
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:29,247
it seems like he has something
to do with the killings here.

564
00:37:31,207 --> 00:37:32,458
Killings?

565
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,545
It's possible that it's not only Peter
that Jerico killed,

566
00:37:36,629 --> 00:37:40,216
but also Ma'am Beverly and Sir Basil.

567
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:48,140
They found a picture of Sir Basil
in Jerico's cabinet.

568
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,478
Jerico is Basil's killer?

569
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,439
And maybe Sir Paco's killer too.

570
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:58,818
They also saw a picture of Sir Paco
marked with an X.

571
00:38:00,069 --> 00:38:03,489
Maybe he had something to do with
Sir Paco falling off the cliff.

572
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:23,467
Where is Jerico?

573
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:24,760
Did they catch him already?

574
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:47,116
The Palacios are really rich prodigals.

575
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:51,704
Instead of making use of this,
they just abandoned this house.

576
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,123
Well,

577
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,750
you're a Palacios now.

578
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,296
And you can change that if you want to.

579
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:46,902
Let's go home.

580
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,071
Let's go home.

581
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,281
<i>Wait a second!</i>

582
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,916
Put this there too.

583
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:03,544
These should be labeled properly.

584
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:04,920
- Where?
- Even the skin.

585
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,297
Where are they?

586
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,215
- Sir.
- Sir.

587
00:41:08,716 --> 00:41:10,009
You can't come in.

588
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:12,136
- Out of my way! This is my house!
- This is a crime scene!

589
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:14,847
Sir,

590
00:41:15,598 --> 00:41:19,143
we found this in the room
of Mr. Jerico Palacios.

591
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,479
So it's confirmed?

592
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:23,355
He's really the killer?

593
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:25,191
I knew it!

594
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,650
I knew it!

595
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:28,360
It's too early to assume.

596
00:41:28,444 --> 00:41:31,405
But we found this baseball bat
with blood on it.

597
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,533
We'll submit it to the forensics lab
to find out whose blood is this.

598
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,119
I'm sure it's Peter's.

599
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:41,957
And, sir, we also found this
in the cabinet belonging to Mr. Palacios.

600
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:48,380
Black hoodie and black gloves!

601
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:51,175
Remember what Sofia told us?

602
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,552
That's what Beverly's killer was wearing.

603
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,554
Are you sure these belong to Jerico?

604
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,183
Sir, as I said, we will submit these
to the forensic team.

605
00:41:59,808 --> 00:42:03,354
We will check all the fingerprints
and DNA samples that we find.

606
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,981
What DNA?

607
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:09,360
That's no longer needed
because it's already confirmed.

608
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,530
I'm sure that bastard is the one

609
00:42:12,613 --> 00:42:15,616
who's been killing people here
at the Palacios' Estate!

610
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:20,037
And we also found this
in your nephew's bag.

611
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:30,798
That's the same type of morphine tablet
that was used to poison your son.

612
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:36,512
And we are looking at the possibility
that all of these are connected

613
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:38,806
with the death of Mr. Basil Palacios.

614
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,683
I knew it.

615
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:41,809
I knew it!

616
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,320
Let's go home.

617
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,822
Wait, hold on.

618
00:42:54,905 --> 00:42:56,407
Where are you going? What's the problem?

619
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,619
I'm not in the mood anymore.

620
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,247
I'm sorry.

621
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:05,416
Let's just go back to the estate.

622
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,183
Jerico?

623
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,062
Jerico, why are you being like this?

624
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,480
Why are you looking at me that way?

625
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,649
- Just stay there.
- What?

626
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,859
Don't move.

627
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:32,818
Why?

628
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:37,114
<i>Once Jerico is gone,</i>

629
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,117
<i>there will only be three new-generation</i>
<i>members of the Palacios family left.</i>

630
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,702
<i>Ma'am Rebecca,</i>

631
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,121
Ms. Sam's baby,

632
00:43:44,204 --> 00:43:45,706
<i>and Sofia.</i>

633
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:48,709
One with a mental disorder

634
00:43:48,792 --> 00:43:50,669
and one who hasn't been born yet.

635
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,882
They're nothing compared to my daughter.

636
00:43:54,965 --> 00:43:58,135
<i>You will not leave this house, Sam.</i>

637
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,303
Or what?

638
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:00,929
You will hurt me?

639
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:03,098
You will lock me up?

640
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,975
<i>If you harm me,</i>

641
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:07,311
<i>you're even less likely to see</i>
<i>your grandchild.</i>

642
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:11,357
You think you can take Paco's child
away from me?

643
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:14,318
You still don't know me, Sam.

644
00:44:15,402 --> 00:44:21,659
<i>You have no idea what I can do</i>
<i>to get what I want.</i>

645
00:44:21,742 --> 00:44:24,119
NEXT EPISODE

646
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,709
<i>I'm sorry</i>

647
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,295
<i>for only visiting you just now.</i>
