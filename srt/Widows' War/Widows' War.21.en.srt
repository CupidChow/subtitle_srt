1
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:08,985
One family down, a few more to go.

2
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,612
<i>Francis is innocent.</i>

3
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:14,115
As soon as Francis receives his sentence,
I will target you next.

4
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,910
And your mother too, and Beverly.

5
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,829
<i>All of you who destroyed my life will pay!</i>

6
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,748
George has been missing
for quite a while now.

7
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,166
She's not answering my texts.

8
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:24,959
- We'll help you find her.
- Let's go.

9
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,503
PREVIOUSLY

10
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,505
Who are you? Don't come near me.

11
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:30,131
Help! Help!

12
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:32,050
What's wrong?

13
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:37,889
<i>Look for the person who did this to her!</i>

14
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:38,932
I saw that.

15
00:01:39,015 --> 00:01:41,184
That's what Bev's killer was wearing.

16
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,101
Listen to me first.

17
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,561
What else do I need to hear?

18
00:01:43,645 --> 00:01:45,438
- What the--
- Because I am a Palacios.

19
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:46,940
We're siblings, Ma'am Rebecca.

20
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,776
No one should know that we're siblings,
especially not Ma'am Aurora.

21
00:01:49,859 --> 00:01:52,362
I'm looking for Papa. I've been suspecting
for a long time now that he's still alive.

22
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,030
<i>I opened his coffin, but it was empty.</i>

23
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:58,243
<i>They still haven't caught them,</i>
<i>but they already know who the killer is.</i>

24
00:01:58,868 --> 00:01:59,953
Who?

25
00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,079
George.

26
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,164
I knew it.

27
00:02:03,248 --> 00:02:06,584
You don't know how much trouble
you left behind for your family

28
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:07,669
and me.

29
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,796
Sir Inigo, right?

30
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,924
Sir Basil's best friend.

31
00:02:13,007 --> 00:02:15,301
And you're his trusted staff.

32
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:18,555
Did he tell you something that…?

33
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:21,474
What do best friends tell each other?

34
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,935
They share secrets.

35
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:29,399
Is Mr. Galvan Palacios here?

36
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,068
<i>The body of a woman was found</i>
<i>in the river of Sitio Rosas.</i>

37
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:33,361
<i>She jumped into the river.</i>

38
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,989
<i>She has no ID,</i>
<i>but based on the description,</i>

39
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,033
<i>she's about the same age</i>
<i>as Georgina Palacios.</i>

40
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:06,394
She's not… she's not my daughter.

41
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,939
She's not George.

42
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,696
She's not my daughter.

43
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,156
It's not George.

44
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,831
Papa's body isn't there.

45
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,626
When I opened it, there was no body.

46
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:35,423
I don't know, Auntie.

47
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:37,800
What really happened to Papa?

48
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,845
Maybe your father is still alive.

49
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:43,723
I will call you later.

50
00:03:46,017 --> 00:03:47,310
Bro, it's like this.

51
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:52,899
If there's no body inside,
it only means one thing.

52
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:54,651
That maybe your father is still alive.

53
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,862
But…

54
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,364
where is he?

55
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:01,699
Why is he not showing himself?

56
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,452
Why do you always follow me, huh?

57
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:07,664
Bro, I already know your secret,

58
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,041
so why don't I help you with your plan?

59
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,418
No thanks.

60
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:17,048
Don't you want to find your father?

61
00:04:19,717 --> 00:04:22,387
That's the reason why I came here to work.

62
00:04:23,012 --> 00:04:25,306
I want to know what happened to Papa

63
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,891
and why he left me.

64
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,938
Bro, I will help you find your father.

65
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:57,046
What's the matter?
What happened?

66
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,506
He punched the wall.

67
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:00,758
Why?

68
00:05:01,092 --> 00:05:06,347
Auntie Ruth went to the morgue
to identify George's body.

69
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,515
What are you doing here?

70
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,564
Ward, is what I heard true?

71
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,860
George is in the morgue?

72
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:22,530
She's dead?

73
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,782
Don't be too happy.

74
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,745
The body in the morgue was not George's.

75
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,458
She's not dead yet
like you want her to be.

76
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,878
Ward, you're wrong.

77
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,175
If it's true that she killed Beverly,
then she needs to pay for it.

78
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,177
She needs to be jailed.

79
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,013
But I don't want George to die.

80
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,723
You're lying!

81
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,726
Isn't that what you want?

82
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:55,563
For George to die
so that we'll leave this house?

83
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:08,618
We're not allowed here.

84
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,578
We'll be in trouble if we're seen here.

85
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:14,415
You opened your father's coffin.

86
00:06:14,499 --> 00:06:16,084
Will you be scared now?

87
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:18,920
And besides, the Palacios family is busy

88
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,756
with what happened
to Ms. Beverly and Ma'am George.

89
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,508
No one will see us here.

90
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:25,885
Let's go.

91
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:27,345
What's your plan?

92
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,183
Calm down.

93
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:34,685
Ward…

94
00:06:34,769 --> 00:06:36,062
Let go of me!

95
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:45,613
You're so bad.

96
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,659
You're the reason George is missing.

97
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:55,373
You're the reason
our family became miserable.

98
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,630
Don't you pity us?

99
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:04,632
Ward…

100
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,343
Ward, I'm sorry.

101
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,683
I'm sorry that your sister
got caught up in all this.

102
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:17,687
But Ward, think about it.

103
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,566
If she's innocent,

104
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,734
then where is she?

105
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,613
Why is she missing? Why is she hiding?

106
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:30,283
How come she's not making
her whereabouts known even to you?

107
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,784
Think about it, Ward.

108
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:33,202
No…

109
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,585
George is not a killer.

110
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,504
No…

111
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:45,465
George is not a killer.

112
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,509
No…

113
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,970
Ward.

114
00:07:51,053 --> 00:07:52,805
George is not a killer!

115
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,640
No!

116
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,268
No! No!

117
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,729
No!

118
00:07:59,812 --> 00:08:02,398
Let's not fight anymore, please!

119
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:04,066
We really, really need each other.

120
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,277
Let's help each other find George.

121
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:09,405
Let go of my son!

122
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,034
Don't you even go near that woman!

123
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:17,580
Auntie, don't get mad!

124
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,999
Sam is not doing anything wrong.

125
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:23,711
In fact, she's concerned about Ward.

126
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,046
You too!

127
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,381
Just go back to your mother
if you don't want to get involved.

128
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:28,299
Auntie, please.

129
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:30,927
Please, I was just talking to Ward.

130
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:34,639
I know what's happening to you
is frustrating,

131
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:35,973
but…

132
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,975
You don't know how I'm feeling, Sam.

133
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,186
You don't know how it feels

134
00:08:40,269 --> 00:08:42,438
to be a mother whose daughter is missing.

135
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,483
You don't know how it feels

136
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:48,653
to be a mother
who needs to go to the morgue

137
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,948
to identify her own child.

138
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:56,911
How I wish I was the one who was dead!

139
00:08:56,994 --> 00:09:00,831
How I wish I was the one who got hurt
and not my children!

140
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,044
Auntie…

141
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,963
No!

142
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,131
I don't need your pity!

143
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:12,176
What I need is
for you to stay away from my son.

144
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:16,055
And if I find out that you went near him
and talked to him,

145
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,141
you'll be the next to disappear
from this mansion!

146
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:22,728
Let's go.

147
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:24,272
Let's go!

148
00:09:30,319 --> 00:09:31,404
Let's go.

149
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:50,256
The reason we're here is because…

150
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:58,306
this is where the Palacios files are kept,
even those of their ancestors.

151
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:02,476
Our goal is to find your father's files,

152
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,645
where he went,

153
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:07,565
and the riches that you're not aware of.

154
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,406
So what year did your father disappear?

155
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:18,326
1999.

156
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:20,077
99…

157
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,164
Here, look at this.

158
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,553
What?

159
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,640
Did you find a death certificate?

160
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:46,312
It seems like these are all
his travel receipts

161
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,440
and other business reports.

162
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,025
There's no death certificate.

163
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,195
That's because…

164
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,198
he might still be alive.

165
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,325
But where is he?

166
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,077
Why won't he show himself to us?

167
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,828
Even to Rebecca, he didn't show himself.

168
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:08,834
What month was it again that
your father left your house?

169
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,590
I remember we were putting up
the Christmas tree.

170
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,425
That was

171
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,094
around November.

172
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,678
November.

173
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,948
Here.

174
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,576
There's a prescription
similar to Rebecca's.

175
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,453
1999.

176
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,004
Did your father have a mental illness?

177
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,881
Hey!

178
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,260
Did your father have a mental illness?

179
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,386
I don't know.

180
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:02,930
Mother didn't mention anything.

181
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:05,516
All he said was that
he was going to Rebecca,

182
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,685
and then he suddenly disappeared.

183
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,273
Bro, I'm sorry,

184
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,819
but as far as I know,

185
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,030
that mental illness is hereditary.

186
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,242
Could it be

187
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:27,079
that Ma'am Rebecca inherited
your father's mental illness,

188
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,749
and your father ended up
in a mental hospital

189
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:33,419
and that's why
he wasn't able to come back?

190
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:10,641
Bro…

191
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,101
Are you okay?

192
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:14,436
Yes.

193
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,438
We almost got caught there.

194
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:29,326
A gold digger can bury herself
if she digs in too deep.

195
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,497
That's why others should be careful.

196
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:35,624
If you dig for gold,

197
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:41,255
sometimes what you end up seeing
is the Angel of Death's sickle.

198
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:43,632
Excuse me, Aurora,

199
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:47,344
but is it me or is it Sam
you are referring to?

200
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,597
I was never ambitious.

201
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,475
We all know how Aurora sees us, right?

202
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,019
Us and Bev.

203
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,229
We're all gold diggers.

204
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:01,525
Are you stupid?

205
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,903
I was referring to you.

206
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,195
Only you.

207
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:09,450
You mother of all gold diggers.

208
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:15,122
Oh. Me? You meant me?

209
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,333
Why did you involve the dead?

210
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,629
Come on. Bev is already dead,
but you involved her too?

211
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,505
You should've shown a little
respect to Bev.

212
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,132
Is that so, Vivian?

213
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,760
Ma, Auntie Vivian, please.

214
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:30,095
She started it.

215
00:15:32,014 --> 00:15:33,682
Come here!

216
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:37,061
Sit down!

217
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,398
You were being all dramatic
with that woman?

218
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:46,946
Maybe you have forgotten
what her family did to us.

219
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,615
Mother, it seemed to me
like Sam was concerned.

220
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:51,492
Concerned?

221
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:54,036
She's just putting on an act.

222
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,791
Sam is like the child of a demon.

223
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,377
She's just manipulating you.

224
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:03,295
She pretended that
she was worried about you,

225
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,924
but all she wanted was to get
an update from you.

226
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,176
Do you understand?

227
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:11,845
Mother, we need an ally.

228
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,890
We need someone to help us.

229
00:16:15,724 --> 00:16:17,893
We can't do this with just the two of us.

230
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,020
Ward, we can do this.

231
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,817
When your father died,
it was just three of us.

232
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:28,195
We didn't ask for help from anyone.

233
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,781
Now that your sister is missing,

234
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,033
we can't rely on other people.

235
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,078
Do you understand what I'm saying?

236
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,249
Answer me!

237
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:41,583
Do you understand?

238
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,213
Promise me

239
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,632
that you will never go to Sam

240
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:51,176
or any of the Castillos.

241
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,386
Promise me!

242
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,596
I promise, Mother.

243
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,312
- Auntie.
- Attorney.

244
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,898
Well? Have you seen George?

245
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,155
Come here.

246
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:13,157
Mother…

247
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,534
What? Too lazy to search?

248
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,829
You're useless! You're just wasting
the tax that I'm paying!

249
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,747
That's enough, Mother.

250
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:27,421
I understand why you're acting that way,
but I hope you won't insult my morals.

251
00:17:28,422 --> 00:17:31,550
Just like you, I want to find George.

252
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,427
Really?

253
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,179
So what do you want me to do?

254
00:17:35,262 --> 00:17:38,807
I should tell you,
"Good job, Sergeant Villa, amazing!"

255
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,851
You don't even have a decent lead.

256
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:42,811
Ward!

257
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:45,981
Applaud Sergeant Villa! He's so good!

258
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,192
That's enough, Mother.

259
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:49,651
I'm right, aren't I?

260
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,570
You're useless!

261
00:17:53,864 --> 00:17:55,324
Just let it slide.

262
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:56,825
Just let her be.

263
00:17:57,826 --> 00:18:00,162
Mother, stop it.

264
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,580
Apologize to him.

265
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:03,499
I won't apologize to him.

266
00:18:03,582 --> 00:18:06,210
I will only say sorry to him
if he can bring George here.

267
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:07,961
If he can find your sister

268
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,255
and bring back my daughter alive.

269
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,301
Mother, you're too much.

270
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,720
You fight with all our allies.

271
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:20,682
Mother, no one will help us
if you're like that.

272
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:23,936
We won't find any allies.

273
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,198
Yes, Sergeant Casas?

274
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,702
Okay.

275
00:18:41,495 --> 00:18:43,163
Was that Abdul? What did he say?

276
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:47,167
Ma'am, Sergeant Casas has found out
where George was before she went missing.

277
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,418
Where?

278
00:19:07,896 --> 00:19:10,607
Cairo! More alcohol!

279
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:14,236
Cairo, more alcohol!

280
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:27,916
Uncle…

281
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,091
What are you doing here?

282
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,303
I just wanted to see if…

283
00:19:40,387 --> 00:19:41,638
you were okay.

284
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,600
How do I answer that question…

285
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:49,188
after losing a grandchild,

286
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,233
the child of my own son, my legacy?!

287
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:07,706
Uncle, believe it or not,

288
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,460
I understand you.

289
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,050
If something bad ever happened to my baby…

290
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,097
I might kill someone.

291
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,062
Uncle…

292
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,941
Are you sure

293
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:36,401
it was George?

294
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,780
There is no one else.

295
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:46,078
I will use all my power to make her pay!

296
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:52,376
If George was able to kill Beverly,

297
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,337
then could it be possible

298
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,966
that it was she who killed Basil?

299
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,145
Attorney, where is she?
Where is that woman?

300
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,232
Auntie, calm down.

301
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:18,527
We're still not sure about
what Sergeant Casas said.

302
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,654
Everything is clear to me now.

303
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:24,241
Sam is the reason why George is missing.

304
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:26,576
Maybe it was even her who killed Beverly.

305
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:29,121
She wants to seek revenge on my family.

306
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:32,165
Auntie,

307
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:34,626
let the police work on this.

308
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:38,964
I will not trust the police
with my daughter's life.

309
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:40,424
If they do not make a move,

310
00:21:40,507 --> 00:21:43,719
I will make sure justice is done
for George!

311
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,602
What did you say?

312
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,982
Didn't it cross your mind, Uncle,

313
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,694
that it's possible

314
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:06,491
that the same person killed Basil,
Beverly, and your grandson?

315
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,788
Your brother…

316
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,958
Your brother killed my son!

317
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,838
The evidence against my brother
was all circumstantial.

318
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:24,885
There was no strong or clear motive
for Francis to kill your son.

319
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:28,638
Yes, they weren't on good terms.

320
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:30,390
They had a misunderstanding.

321
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:31,808
But murder?

322
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,518
Francis isn't capable of doing that.

323
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:37,147
Of course you would defend
your criminal brother!

324
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:41,359
Okay.

325
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:47,699
Okay, let's accept that Francis is
the suspect for Basil's death.

326
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,996
But it's impossible that
he killed Beverly.

327
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,166
Think about it, Uncle.

328
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:02,339
Why did Beverly and Basil die
one after the other?

329
00:23:05,133 --> 00:23:06,468
So you think

330
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,722
there's only one person
who killed both of them?

331
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,975
It's you who said

332
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,397
there was only one suspect
in Beverly's death.

333
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:23,235
And what's their common
denominator with Basil?

334
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,197
Who did they aggrieve?

335
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:32,369
Who got hurt because
of their secret relationship?

336
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,125
George.

337
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,009
Uncle, I only have one request.

338
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,931
If you find George…

339
00:23:55,058 --> 00:24:00,438
I hope you will not only
investigate her for Beverly's death

340
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:04,234
but also for Basil's death.

341
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,119
Bring my daughter out!

342
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,538
- Demon! Where is my daughter?
- I don't know!

343
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,665
- What do you mean you don't know?
- Let me go!

344
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:21,459
- You demon! Bring George out!
- Let me go!

345
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,712
What are you doing? Let go of me!

346
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,464
Bring my daughter out!

347
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:27,924
- Let me…
- Hey!

348
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:29,342
What the hell?

349
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:30,427
Let go of her!

350
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:31,511
That's enough.

351
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,014
She's pregnant!

352
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,517
Don't defend that woman.

353
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,480
What are you two fighting about?

354
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,024
Sam…

355
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,610
What did you do to Ruth?

356
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:49,654
I don't know, Uncle.
I don't know what she's talking about!

357
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,281
You're a liar!

358
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,783
You were the last person my daughter
spoke to before she went missing.

359
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:56,494
Maybe you're the reason she's missing.

360
00:24:57,245 --> 00:24:58,205
What?

361
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,790
Is that true?

362
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:05,170
We were able to confirm that they went
to see Francis in jail together

363
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,380
before George went missing.

364
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:09,090
Sam…

365
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:12,469
Do you have anything to say about that?

366
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,265
Uncle, I'm not hiding anything.

367
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,726
I did visit Francis in jail,
and George was there.

368
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,144
She even fought with him.

369
00:25:21,228 --> 00:25:24,314
It wasn't me, George! It wasn't me!
George, I didn't kill Basil!

370
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:27,400
Let go of him!
Don't hurt my brother!

371
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:38,620
And then?

372
00:25:39,537 --> 00:25:40,413
What happened?

373
00:25:41,248 --> 00:25:42,666
Of course I defended my brother.

374
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,834
She isn't allowed to hurt my brother.

375
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:47,337
And then, Uncle, she got mad.

376
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,380
She made a threat.

377
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:51,007
She said she'd get revenge on all of us!

378
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:55,053
As soon as Francis is sentenced,
I will target you next.

379
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:58,515
And your mother too, and Beverly.

380
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:02,686
All of you who destroyed my life will pay!

381
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:04,437
Liar!

382
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:06,898
George is not a vengeful person!

383
00:26:06,982 --> 00:26:08,692
You're just twisting things to frame her.

384
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:10,443
Then what?

385
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,029
What else happened?

386
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,367
Then I went back to the prison.

387
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:20,078
We parted ways.
I don't know anything more.

388
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:22,330
You went back to prison,

389
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,792
and after that, you did something bad
to my daughter.

390
00:26:26,543 --> 00:26:28,295
Admit it!

391
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:29,838
Where is my daughter?
Show her to us.

392
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,798
- Admit what you did!
- I have nothing to admit.

393
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:33,925
I didn't do anything wrong!

394
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,180
Bro, let's go. Come on.

395
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:41,933
Let's just come back some other day.

396
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,394
It's still early.
They might not let us in.

397
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,354
We're here already.

398
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:47,897
Go fight for it.

399
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:49,733
But…

400
00:26:51,609 --> 00:26:55,155
Bro, you've been looking
for your father for years.

401
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:58,241
Who knows? He could be right here.

402
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,870
He's waiting for you to find him, Jerico.

403
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:03,163
Come on!

404
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:13,548
Sir, can I ask a question?

405
00:27:13,965 --> 00:27:15,050
What do you need?

406
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,845
I'd like to visit a patient.

407
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,222
It's not yet visiting hours.

408
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:25,143
Okay.

409
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,025
He said later. Let's come back later.

410
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:34,819
Let me do it.

411
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:41,117
Hello, sir.

412
00:27:41,826 --> 00:27:46,081
Sir, maybe you can help my friend.

413
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:48,375
I will be scolded.

414
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,753
I'll take care of you, sir.

415
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:53,755
Please.

416
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,133
Just for a while, okay?

417
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,345
- I'll come back for you.
- Okay.

418
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,097
Thank you.

419
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:13,525
Maybe it is you who killed Beverly,
and you want to pin it on George.

420
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,860
I would never do that!

421
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,988
But it's an open secret that
you hate each other.

422
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,659
You hurt one another.
You threaten one another.

423
00:28:23,326 --> 00:28:26,329
You even blame her
for your brother being in jail.

424
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:29,791
That's enough reason
to hurt Mrs. George Palacios.

425
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,503
Sam?

426
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,213
No way!

427
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:38,550
I'm not convinced that
she's involved here.

428
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,427
Why do you say that?

429
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:43,805
Why would a mother-to-be
kill another person?

430
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,640
They're supposed to be happy.

431
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:46,933
Excited, even.

432
00:28:47,016 --> 00:28:48,476
Because they're going to be a mother.

433
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,104
So no.

434
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:56,234
I don't believe Sam has anything to do
with all the problems here.

435
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,778
You don't get it.

436
00:28:58,862 --> 00:29:00,405
Look at it this way.

437
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:06,286
Isn't Francis the prime suspect
for Basil's death?

438
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:12,250
See? That means it's in their blood.

439
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,044
Being a killer runs in their blood.

440
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:19,340
That's why, Sofia, you shouldn't hang out
with the Balays or the Castillos.

441
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:22,510
Because they are toxic, dangerous people.

442
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,179
But Ward is my friend.

443
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,180
I don't care!

444
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,933
Stay out of the way.

445
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:32,937
I don't care, Attorney,
if you have a hearing now.

446
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,565
Just come here. We need you.

447
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,234
- Just send a different lawyer.
- She's talking about Sam.

448
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:41,696
My child can't go to jail.

449
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,031
Attorney, please.

450
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,245
The youngest…

451
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,123
is already in jail.

452
00:29:53,541 --> 00:29:57,003
But it seems his sister misses him so much
that she wants to join him there.

453
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:59,255
So, the sister will follow soon.

454
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,965
Mother, why are you teasing them?

455
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,303
Oh, Sofia, my child,

456
00:30:05,386 --> 00:30:10,809
don't be like those mothers or their kids.

457
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:15,188
Though if you think about it,
it's not in our genes.

458
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:17,273
What do you think?

459
00:30:17,357 --> 00:30:21,903
Who could the siblings have inherited
that trait from?

460
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,572
I know!

461
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:28,493
From their mother.

462
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:30,787
What's so funny about that?

463
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:33,915
What's so funny?

464
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,500
Your family.

465
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,169
A family of criminals.

466
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,179
Ms. Samantha Palacios, can I talk to you?

467
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:55,937
Detective, don't let that woman go
until she admits the truth.

468
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:58,398
Wait. Why me?

469
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,942
I haven't done anything wrong.
I'm innocent.

470
00:31:01,025 --> 00:31:03,152
Ma'am, I'll just interview you.

471
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,072
How dare you?!

472
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,533
How dare you slap me?!

473
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:11,578
Didn't you say I was a criminal?
That's the slap of a criminal.

474
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:13,955
- There you go!
- And you did it again.

475
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:15,331
Hey, you've slapped me several times.

476
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:19,544
- I'll have you arrested for what you did!
- Do you want me to make it three?

477
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,047
I will have you jailed
for physical assault.

478
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:24,173
You will rot in jail!

479
00:31:24,257 --> 00:31:26,509
- You're so noisy! You're so noisy!
- Along with your kids!

480
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,469
- Really!
- You're so noisy!

481
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,638
You and your children should go together.

482
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:34,934
- You'll be detained alongside each other.
- Go ahead and do it!

483
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,644
- I will really do it!
- Do it!

484
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,980
Do it and don't just talk
because you're so noisy!

485
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,524
- I'm getting deaf because of you!
- Killer! Killer!

486
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:43,693
- Killer! Killer!
- Mother!

487
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,403
- Criminal!
- What's wrong with you?

488
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,988
All you do is annoy others.

489
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,407
What's the problem? She hurt me first!

490
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,201
- You started it.
- I wasn't doing anything!

491
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:54,913
I was just saying the truth
and she slapped me.

492
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,916
You were slapped
because you were annoying her.

493
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,876
It's the truth!

494
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,465
That woman should be ready for me.

495
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:14,140
Do you really believe I have anything
to do with all this, Uncle?

496
00:32:14,223 --> 00:32:18,061
I don't know who or what
to believe anymore.

497
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,232
But I don't trust you

498
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:26,444
as much as I don't trust your brother.

499
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:48,466
Rodolfo Palacios.

500
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,639
There's no patient here with that name.

501
00:32:58,601 --> 00:33:02,855
Are you sure you came
to the right mental facility?

502
00:33:05,775 --> 00:33:11,656
Sir, his aunt definitely said it was
the St. Ignatius Mental Facility.

503
00:33:12,115 --> 00:33:14,826
There's no record of anyone
named Rodolfo Palacios.

504
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:17,912
Are you sure, sir?

505
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:19,330
Too bad.

506
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:22,625
Unless his real name was not recorded.

507
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:26,254
We have patients here
who don't know their real name

508
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,464
because of their grave illness.

509
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:37,974
Do you know when they brought
Rodolfo Palacios here?

510
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,602
November, December 1999.

511
00:33:50,653 --> 00:33:55,575
There was no male patient admitted here
during that period.

512
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,995
There was a female patient though.

513
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:01,831
Who?

514
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,042
Soledad.

515
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,920
Soledad Sanchez.

516
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,005
Do you know her?

517
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:33,613
It's already morning, madam.

518
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:36,741
It looks like you haven't rested yet.

519
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,160
I can't rest, Amando.

520
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,497
Not when there's chaos in my house.

521
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,208
Aren't you used to it already, madam?

522
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,376
This isn't the first or the second time

523
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:49,629
something like this has happened
at the estate.

524
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:52,256
Basil, Paco,

525
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,259
and even Soledad, when…

526
00:34:57,303 --> 00:35:02,016
Do not mention
that woman's name again, Amando.

527
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,685
We buried her in oblivion a long time ago.

528
00:35:06,562 --> 00:35:07,897
I'm sorry, madam.

529
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,114
Excuse me, madam.

530
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:34,048
Bro, are you okay?

531
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,929
I thought we could find my father.

532
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:44,058
Bro, at least you tried.

533
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,894
What's important is you fought for it.

534
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,648
We'll eventually find your father.

535
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,736
If he's not here,
maybe he's somewhere else.

536
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:58,406
Okay?

537
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,034
Thank you.

538
00:36:03,327 --> 00:36:04,412
Of course.

539
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:06,164
It's you, right?

540
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:13,462
No matter what, I got you.

541
00:36:19,468 --> 00:36:20,219
Hey!

542
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,137
Hey.

543
00:36:22,638 --> 00:36:24,140
Who are you looking at?

544
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,350
Didn't you see that woman?

545
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:29,145
Where? That one?

546
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,315
No. Not her.

547
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,026
The other woman. Didn't you see her?

548
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,612
No.

549
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:44,076
Galvan! Galvan!

550
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,495
Where the hell is Sam?

551
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:48,456
Relax.

552
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,751
I haven't sent
your daughter-in-law to jail.

553
00:36:51,834 --> 00:36:52,877
Damn you!

554
00:36:54,670 --> 00:36:56,714
You already know that she's pregnant.

555
00:36:57,381 --> 00:36:58,966
What if Sam gets stressed?

556
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,718
My grandchild will be in danger!

557
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:05,556
Sir Galvan, it's impossible
that Sam killed Beverly.

558
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:08,559
She has nothing to do with what happened.

559
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:12,521
If she's innocent,

560
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,108
she can clear her name.

561
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,193
But if not…

562
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,694
What will you do, sir?

563
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:22,073
Same thing I did to her brother.

564
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,159
I'll send her to jail.

565
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,662
Are you threatening me?

566
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,873
Why would I threaten you?

567
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:34,126
You're not doing anything wrong.

568
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,587
Right, Aurora?

569
00:37:36,671 --> 00:37:40,967
A threat against Sam
is a threat against me.

570
00:37:44,595 --> 00:37:47,181
You won't be able to save Sam.

571
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:51,727
If she's guilty of any wrongdoing,

572
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:56,607
she will face the full wrath of the law

573
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,609
and mine.

574
00:38:10,621 --> 00:38:11,872
Hey.

575
00:38:11,956 --> 00:38:13,332
Hey.

576
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,921
Peter, thanks again.

577
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,548
I'll just call my aunt.

578
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,300
Of course.

579
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,139
It seems you're getting close to Jerico.

580
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,557
So what?

581
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,475
Nothing.

582
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,144
It's just new

583
00:38:33,227 --> 00:38:37,356
because you're not trying to get closer
to the Palacios family.

584
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,443
You know what? You're being judgmental.

585
00:38:42,069 --> 00:38:43,821
Jerico is kind.

586
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,450
And nice to be with.

587
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:49,910
Really?

588
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:53,456
Hello.

589
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:54,790
Hello, Auntie?

590
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,341
Bro…

591
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:28,426
Bro…

592
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:31,637
Let's drink.

593
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:35,641
I'm drunk.

594
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:37,518
All you think about is alcohol.

595
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,645
You didn't even notice Beatrice.

596
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,773
Beatrice?

597
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,151
She doesn't like me.

598
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,319
What do you mean she doesn't like you?

599
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:50,656
She was trying to get your attention
the entire night.

600
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:52,950
I think she likes you.

601
00:40:53,033 --> 00:40:54,326
Unless…

602
00:40:55,202 --> 00:40:56,287
you don't like her.

603
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:57,997
Well, she's okay.

604
00:40:59,665 --> 00:41:01,333
What do you mean, she's okay?

605
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:05,045
Beatrice is very hot.

606
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,132
She's not my type.

607
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,011
What do you mean she's not your type?

608
00:41:12,094 --> 00:41:12,970
Okay.

609
00:41:13,053 --> 00:41:14,889
So you like someone else?

610
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,228
Who? Who?

611
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,605
Do I know the person?

612
00:41:27,026 --> 00:41:27,985
Bro…

613
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:32,156
if you like that person, talk to her.

614
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,367
Tell her that you like her.

615
00:41:35,993 --> 00:41:37,578
Or…

616
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,749
just suddenly kiss her.

617
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,131
I think…

618
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:52,927
he'll get mad if I just…

619
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:55,471
I just kiss him.

620
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,151
"Him"?

621
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:44,520
What are you doing in my son's room?

622
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:49,692
I'm…

623
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,736
I'm just looking

624
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:57,408
for any clues George might have left

625
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,369
that could point us
to where she is right now.

626
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:02,538
Just in case Sam won't speak up.

627
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,207
Really?

628
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,377
You're just here for my son's wife?

629
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:14,425
That's what Basil would want me to do.

630
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,763
Excuse me.

631
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,436
I…

632
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,188
never liked you.

633
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:32,818
I know.

634
00:43:33,652 --> 00:43:34,737
I know.

635
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:38,073
Excuse me.

636
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:38,342
Sam still hasn't come out
of the room, madam.

637
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:41,220
Sergeant Villa is still talking to her.

638
00:44:41,887 --> 00:44:47,434
Do you think, Amando, that they have
strong evidence against Sam?

639
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,812
I don't know, madam.

640
00:44:49,895 --> 00:44:52,481
But if they do, that's a big problem.

641
00:44:53,273 --> 00:44:56,402
Your grandchild will be affected
if she gets jailed.

642
00:44:56,819 --> 00:45:02,032
Or maybe I might just solve one problem.

643
00:45:02,616 --> 00:45:04,326
What problem, madam?

644
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:07,871
How to get rid of my grandchild's mother.

645
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,165
The moment Sam goes to jail,

646
00:45:10,249 --> 00:45:13,043
I can easily take guardianship
of her child.

647
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:17,798
I'll have my grandchild to myself
while she's in jail.

648
00:45:19,883 --> 00:45:21,635
Mercy will not allow it.

649
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,262
She'll fight for her grandchild.

650
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:26,932
Come on, Amando.

651
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:29,935
Mercy is never a threat.

652
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:36,942
The moment she fights with me,
she'll end up like her husband.

653
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:43,740
People like Mercy or Orly
are easily disposable.

654
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:13,729
- Mother--
- What's with you?

655
00:46:13,812 --> 00:46:15,147
What?

656
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:18,150
What is it?

657
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:19,693
I'm not yet done with Sam.

658
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:22,779
I have a strong hunch that
she's hiding George.

659
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,823
Mother, Sam has nothing to do with this.

660
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,242
So now you're siding with her?

661
00:46:27,326 --> 00:46:29,578
Go ahead and go with her then,
since you're choosing her.

662
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,787
You're conniving with her.

663
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,956
Go ahead, do what you want!
Take her side if you want to!

664
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,000
Mother, can you please be quiet?

665
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,879
George sent me a text.

666
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,717
So your sister is okay?

667
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,928
Where is she? What happened to her?

668
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:47,012
This is what she said.

669
00:46:47,095 --> 00:46:49,264
Where will we fetch her from?

670
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:01,777
Ms. Samantha Palacios,
do you have anything to do with

671
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:03,445
the disappearance
of Ms. Georgina Palacios?

672
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,656
You were the last person my daughter
spoke to before the trouble started.

673
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,491
I would be careful about accusing me.

674
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:09,785
- Let's go. Hurry up.
- I don't want to! What's with you?

675
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:12,663
- Ward, what hospital?
- St. Therese Medical Hospital.

676
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,790
- Ma'am George is in the hospital?
- <i>A car overtook her car.</i>

677
00:47:14,873 --> 00:47:16,792
Can you remember who did this to you?

678
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:20,837
- Mother, I got into an accident.
- No, they meant to harm you.

679
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,005
It was a black car.

680
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:23,632
Instead of visiting her at the hospital,

681
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:26,677
why don't you prove that George
is Beverly's killer?

682
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:31,640
Who knows? Maybe you can also prove
that George killed Basil.

683
00:47:31,723 --> 00:47:34,226
Sam? What are you doing in George's room?

684
00:47:34,309 --> 00:47:37,396
Jerico and I know where Ma'am George is.

685
00:47:37,479 --> 00:47:39,106
We are here to get George.

686
00:47:39,189 --> 00:47:39,982
- I said move aside!
- Please!

687
00:47:40,065 --> 00:47:42,985
Your daughter will pay for what she did
to Beverly and my grandson.

688
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:45,612
Just try coming closer!
We'll end up killing each other!
