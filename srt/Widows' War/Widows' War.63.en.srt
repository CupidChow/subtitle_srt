1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,891
<i>I already broke off with her</i>
<i>before, but you were born.</i>

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,561
The moment I saw you, my heart melted.

3
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:22,105
<i>You're the only one I have left…</i>

4
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:24,941
<i>If you leave me,</i>
<i>there's nothing left for me.</i>

5
00:00:25,024 --> 00:00:27,110
What's the update from your friend?

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,237
Any news about Rebecca?

7
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:31,239
CCTV footage of her was
taken along Jacinto Avenue.

8
00:00:31,322 --> 00:00:32,532
Come on, let's go.

9
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:35,285
Where? I won't allow you
to keep stressing my son.

10
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:36,202
Your son?

11
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,662
What kind of people do you have?

12
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:41,041
Jericho's colleagues in
the military got ahead of you.

13
00:00:41,124 --> 00:00:41,916
They already have a lead.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,210
<i>This is important.</i>
<i>I followed Ms. Samantha.</i>

15
00:00:44,294 --> 00:00:46,379
<i>She's now here</i>
<i>in the PAO Office with Jericho.</i>

16
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,256
And Rebecca has arrived too.

17
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,675
<i>What are you going to tell me?</i>

18
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:52,761
<i>What do I need to know?</i>

19
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:54,512
There's something you need to know.

20
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:55,430
We're sisters.

21
00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,681
<i>I already know the truth.</i>

22
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,016
<i>I already know that I'm your daughter.</i>

23
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,809
Please let me explain, my child.

24
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,186
I will sue you

25
00:01:01,269 --> 00:01:03,521
because of what you did to me
and my children.

26
00:01:03,605 --> 00:01:05,315
Are you kidding me right now?

27
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:08,401
Stop lying and let's just
see each other in court.

28
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:13,907
PREVIOUSLY

29
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,451
Sir, I'm sorry.

30
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:19,370
I just want to sympathize with Sofia.

31
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:30,423
Nothing to apologize for.

32
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,886
I just wanted
to invite Sofia to eat outside,

33
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,723
but it seems she's fine with you.

34
00:01:41,059 --> 00:01:43,478
Just make sure you're only friends.

35
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:45,063
You're both still young.

36
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:51,027
And I don't want you
to repeat what happened before, Ward.

37
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,780
Finish your studies first.

38
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,616
Yes, Sir Galvan.

39
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:57,742
Thank you.

40
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,290
Maybe I can accompany Sofia
to the milk tea house nearby?

41
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,795
Because if she's stays here,
she remembers Ms. Vivian.

42
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:12,215
Louie and Jeff will be with us.

43
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,303
All right. Ask Bill to drive you.

44
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:21,099
Okay, Dad.

45
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,225
Okay, sir.

46
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,528
Cairo…

47
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,825
Call security.

48
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,829
Tell them to double the unit
that will escort Sofia.

49
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,790
The killer is still on the loose.

50
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,711
I don't want something bad to happen

51
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:53,339
to the future CEO of Palacios Mining.

52
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,853
Rebecca, please?

53
00:03:06,936 --> 00:03:09,355
Can we just talk and settle things?

54
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,191
Let's not bring this to court.

55
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,068
You will only lose Rebecca.

56
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:15,361
Don't do this.

57
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:17,488
I am your mother.

58
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:19,449
After denying…

59
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,368
that I am your daughter
in front of my face,

60
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:26,873
and making the world believe
that I am your niece,

61
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,710
you tell me now that you are my mother.

62
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:35,798
You're so shameless, huh?

63
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,638
If you were able
to give up your motherhood to me,

64
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,556
well I can't do the same.

65
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,227
You already deprived me
of the chance to be your daughter.

66
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,604
And now…

67
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:53,191
You will steal my chance to be a mother?

68
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:57,737
You didn't even give me the experience

69
00:03:57,820 --> 00:04:00,073
of embracing my children,

70
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,992
taking care of them.

71
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,119
You didn't give me that.

72
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:10,917
Okay, fine.

73
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,462
Just guard Sofia properly.

74
00:04:20,802 --> 00:04:22,637
What's the update on Rebecca?

75
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,644
She's with Sam and Jericho.

76
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:32,522
And there's a lawyer with them too.

77
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,191
Why?

78
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:43,032
Ma'am Rebecca will sue Ma'am Aurora.

79
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,458
Good.

80
00:04:53,751 --> 00:04:57,297
I hope Rebecca wins
and Aurora goes to jail.

81
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,551
For the many sins she has committed,

82
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,429
she deserves to be locked up.

83
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,311
Okay, sir.

84
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,027
I can never forgive you.

85
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:20,945
Now get out.

86
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,322
Let's just see each other in court.

87
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:24,449
No, Rebecca. Please…

88
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,950
Please let's talk about this.

89
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:28,578
Just the two of us, my child.

90
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:31,539
What for?

91
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:35,418
For you to tell lies… over and over again.

92
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:40,006
That's enough.

93
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,760
You are too evil.

94
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:47,972
If you can't return
Rebecca's children, just leave.

95
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,558
Shut up, Samantha.

96
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,436
Rebecca, let's go.

97
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,520
No.

98
00:05:54,604 --> 00:05:55,730
No. No.

99
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:07,492
Rico.

100
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:31,224
I thought I could get Baby Gilbert's
birth certificate right away?

101
00:06:31,307 --> 00:06:33,434
What happened? Why did the plan change?

102
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:35,520
<i>Things suddenly became strict here.</i>

103
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:40,108
<i>Your request for a very advanced</i>
<i>birth registration is difficult to do.</i>

104
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,319
<i>Especially since he's only</i>
<i>five months in the womb.</i>

105
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:47,865
<i>And your plan to apply</i>
<i>for a passport for the baby,</i>

106
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,367
<i>non-appearance in the Passport Bureau</i>

107
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,451
<i>is no longer allowed.</i>

108
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:54,122
<i>Even newborn babies are</i>
<i>required to do biometrics.</i>

109
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,209
George, don't worry.

110
00:06:58,292 --> 00:07:00,711
Let's look for a baby
for hire in our area.

111
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,422
Someone who is newly born and a mestizo.

112
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:07,760
Well, just prepare
the birth certificate, Bong.

113
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,430
We'll take care of the other
requirements for the passport.

114
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,056
Bye.

115
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:22,108
Mom, remember our deal.
Once I get Sam's baby,

116
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,819
you and Ward must leave this place.

117
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,780
Wherever baby and I end up,
we'll be together.

118
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,199
George, what about Ward?

119
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,243
When are we going to tell your brother?

120
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,123
Ward.

121
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:41,878
George, here are my requirements
for the passport.

122
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:49,844
I'm super grateful for you, Jericho.

123
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,848
You know, even if we're not real siblings,

124
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,435
you still see me the same.

125
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,147
And you've been protecting me ever since.

126
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,899
You're the first Palacios

127
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,151
who made me feel that I have a family.

128
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:08,404
So even if we're just cousins,
nothing will change.

129
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,989
I will still treat you as my sister.

130
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,325
That's a promise, huh?

131
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:13,367
Nothing will change.

132
00:08:13,451 --> 00:08:14,785
Of course.

133
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,954
And one more thing,

134
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:19,916
I'm happy that you've accepted
that Sam is your sister.

135
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:23,044
So, if I get unlucky

136
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,087
and am killed by the Palacios killer,

137
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,423
you still have a sibling
that will protect you.

138
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,592
No, no, Jericho…

139
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:31,677
I won't allow someone to hurt you.

140
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,556
I have to go, Rebecca.
I'm on my way to my colleagues

141
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,643
who will help me find
evidence for your case.

142
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:42,688
Just text me what time you'll
be picked up in the PAO office.

143
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:46,359
Okay, thank you.

144
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,527
Take care.

145
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,656
Okay, bye.

146
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,330
Where are we going?

147
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:01,332
And when?

148
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:05,836
Mom, I'm excited already.

149
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,464
It seems we're going somewhere beautiful.

150
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:16,597
Why the look on your face?

151
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:20,685
It seems this is a big surprise.

152
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:33,739
Sam.

153
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,908
Hi, Rebecca.

154
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:37,660
I'm sorry I can't go there right away.

155
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,162
I'm still here in the OB. I can't leave.

156
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,416
How are you?
Have you talked to Attorney Lilet yet?

157
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:45,793
<i>She's still not here.</i>

158
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,170
<i>I'm waiting for her…</i>

159
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,380
<i>Oh, there she is, Sam.</i>

160
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:51,966
Hello, Attorney.

161
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,974
I already talked
to the possible witnesses you mentioned.

162
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,894
Delia and the nurse?

163
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,856
Yes, and they're willing to testify.

164
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,067
<i>Yes, Delia.</i>

165
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:14,655
<i>She saw a picture</i>
<i>of me pregnant, remember?</i>

166
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,660
But, Amando confiscated that photo.

167
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:23,205
Maybe we can find that picture

168
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:25,041
Or, if Amando got rid of it,

169
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,712
maybe he still has
the negative or the camera used

170
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,881
because that's physical evidence, right?

171
00:10:32,882 --> 00:10:36,010
<i>But, most likely it got burned</i>
<i>along with the house.</i>

172
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,060
Amando…

173
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,395
Amando…

174
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,230
He can be a witness, right?

175
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:50,816
I can include him in the list of people

176
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,277
who will give testimony
on the witness stand.

177
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,867
<i>I don't want to be pessimistic,</i>
<i>but I know Amando.</i>

178
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,328
<i>He is so loyal to Mom Aurora.</i>

179
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:04,538
<i>For sure he will testify for her.</i>

180
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:07,750
<i>And I will grill him</i>
<i>during cross-examination.</i>

181
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,671
<i>I will not stop until I get</i>
<i>the answers I want from him.</i>

182
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,849
We're still planning it.

183
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,518
Don't get too excited.

184
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,853
- There's still time.
- That's right.

185
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:30,689
Maybe this is not just a vacation.

186
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,650
Are we leaving for good?

187
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,986
No, what's with you?

188
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:39,615
I thought you were planning
to leave this place.

189
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:41,492
I don't want to leave, Mom.

190
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,662
I pity Sofia.

191
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:48,916
Her mother just died
and we suddenly leaving her.

192
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:50,418
Right?

193
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,298
Ward…

194
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,716
Ward, my son.

195
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,053
Don't get too close to Sofia.

196
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,763
You're still young.

197
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,808
Right, George?

198
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,603
Yes, Ward.

199
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:13,232
And we should always be ready
for whatever changes in life

200
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:15,401
so we don't always get hurt.

201
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,694
Remember that.

202
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,030
Yes, George, I will remember that.

203
00:12:35,129 --> 00:12:37,256
Aside from Delia and the nurse,

204
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:39,216
your pelvic exam could also confirm

205
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,885
that you really got pregnant.

206
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:44,722
We're just waiting
for the results of the ultrasound

207
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,557
and hysteroscopy to support it.

208
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:51,353
How about Auntie Hillary, Attorney?

209
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,022
She has my babies.

210
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:57,985
Well, unfortunately,
since you don't have evidence

211
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:01,447
to support whatever is written
in that letter,

212
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:04,533
an invitation for questioning
was only sent to her.

213
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:09,038
And she has a right to decline
in whatever investigation.

214
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,959
<i>My team is also trying to find proof,</i>

215
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,087
<i>but they can't find any adoption letter</i>

216
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:22,176
<i>or any document that would prove</i>
<i>that she has your children.</i>

217
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:28,933
Jericho is helping me find the evidence.

218
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,101
But, she stands a chance, Attorney?

219
00:13:31,185 --> 00:13:33,062
<i>Well, there is a chance</i>

220
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,732
<i>because we have witnesses and evidence</i>

221
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,818
<i>to prove that she did get pregnant,</i>

222
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:44,782
and who she was with,
and that she had her babies

223
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,951
before they took her children from her.

224
00:13:47,451 --> 00:13:49,662
All of this is pointing at Ms. Aurora.

225
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:55,417
If we can also prove
that Ms. Aurora has an accomplice,

226
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,086
we can also sue them.

227
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,631
What case will you and Rebecca file?

228
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:02,174
Kidnapping.

229
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:05,094
<i>And what will happen next?</i>

230
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,013
Once a case is filled,

231
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,391
when is the court hearing and resolution?

232
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:13,936
I can't say that for now.

233
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:16,772
After we file the case,

234
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,191
there's a lot of process
we need to go through.

235
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:22,736
<i>In the preliminary investigation,</i>

236
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,406
<i>the respondent will be given a chance</i>

237
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:27,283
<i>to submit a counter affidavit.</i>

238
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,244
We will also answer that with a reply.

239
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:33,038
And they will also submit a rejoinder.

240
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:35,583
That's when the fiscal will decide

241
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:38,544
if the complaint will be filed in court.

242
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,383
So, we won't tell Ward

243
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:48,470
about our plan of taking Sam's baby?

244
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:52,641
I want to Mother…

245
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,644
but sometimes Ward fails.

246
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:59,398
He can't hide a secret for long.

247
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:03,110
Yes, and this is too heavy for him.

248
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:05,237
He might not be able to handle it.

249
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:08,198
Let's just tell him when
we're about to leave.

250
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:09,867
Let's keep this among
the two of us, George.

251
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,582
But, we will make a move right away.

252
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,419
That's why I will prepare a
draft of the complaint affidavit

253
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:21,962
so that I can file it.

254
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,506
<i>Thank you, Attorney.</i>

255
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,552
Rebecca…

256
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,888
Why did you become silent?

257
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,057
I'm just worried.

258
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:35,726
You know Auntie Aurora.

259
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:43,776
She will do
all the dirty tricks just to win.

260
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:49,281
As long as we have the truth,
you shouldn't be scared.

261
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:02,753
Go ahead, Attorney Matias.

262
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:04,505
Thank you, Your Honor.

263
00:16:09,426 --> 00:16:12,680
Rebecca, you're telling this court

264
00:16:12,763 --> 00:16:15,933
that you had twins five years ago.

265
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:16,892
Is that correct?

266
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:21,563
Yes.

267
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:28,237
But, Auntie Aurora
kept it a secret from me.

268
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:32,825
Is that the reason
you're suing her for kidnapping now?

269
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,202
Yes.

270
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,622
Why didn't you know
where your children were?

271
00:16:38,706 --> 00:16:40,624
I was sick then.

272
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:44,586
I was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

273
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:48,924
And my mind, at that time, wasn't clear.

274
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:53,470
I didn't even remember that I got pregnant.

275
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:56,557
But, I have recovered.

276
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,852
Recovered…

277
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,606
Do you have proof that you're well now?

278
00:17:05,274 --> 00:17:06,483
Yes.

279
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,361
I underwent therapy and medications.

280
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,697
I have a medical certificate

281
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,575
from the head psychiatrist

282
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,119
of St. Ignatius Mental Health Facility

283
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,706
stating that I am mentally stable now.

284
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:24,168
And there's another one
from the resident psychiatrist

285
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:27,504
of Raphael Doctors' Hospital.

286
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,425
Your Honor…

287
00:17:31,925 --> 00:17:35,888
We present to this honorable
court two medical records

288
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,017
proving my client's current
mental stability.

289
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:44,146
May we please have it marked
as our exhibit 7 and 7A?

290
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,107
We also present hospital records

291
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:50,527
proving that my client
gave birth five years ago.

292
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,573
May we please mark it
as our exhibit 8 series?

293
00:17:54,656 --> 00:17:56,617
This will be properly authenticated

294
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,160
by our next witnesses

295
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:00,537
who officially issued these test results.

296
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,538
Mark it.

297
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:03,290
Thank you, Your Honor.

298
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,301
Auntie Aurora won't let us go
to the hearing.

299
00:18:14,384 --> 00:18:16,095
She asked Rico to keep an eye on her.

300
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,387
Take care of her.

301
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,598
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

302
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,266
Ma'am Sam… Ma'am Sam, wait.

303
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,434
You can't leave.

304
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,603
Ma'am Aurora ordered
to stop you from leaving.

305
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,313
Where are you going, ma'am?

306
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:27,689
Bill, Ando. What's with you?

307
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:29,399
I will be in trouble
with Ma'am Aurora. Ma'am Sam.

308
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,443
I will be in trouble with Ma'am Aurora.

309
00:18:31,527 --> 00:18:33,278
Ma'am George, don't leave.

310
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,238
Ma'am Sam…

311
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,574
What's with you? Ma'am Sam, don't leave.

312
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:38,992
Wait.

313
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,165
Thank you, Your Honor.

314
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:50,379
- We need to triple-check the documents…
- Yes, Ma'am.

315
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,214
I am not like your client.

316
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,007
I don't have connections or money

317
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:57,010
that will alter your evidence
or pay your witnesses.

318
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,139
Order in the court.

319
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:04,518
Ms. Witness, your lawyer
will address this court

320
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,645
and the opposing counsel on your behalf.

321
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,481
Attorney Matias,

322
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:12,442
warn your client of the consequence

323
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,736
of improper court behavior.

324
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:26,790
Give me back my children.

325
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,167
You're a demon! You're a liar.

326
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,459
Why did you take my children away from me?

327
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,419
Give them back.

328
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,171
- Rebecca.
- Attorney Matias.

329
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:33,672
Control your client.

330
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,762
Calm down. Sit down.

331
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,527
Sam.

332
00:19:57,946 --> 00:20:00,073
What if we go to Dr. Flores?

333
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,450
You're not needed in the hearing.

334
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,784
No, Rebecca needs me there.

335
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,494
She needs my support. I'm okay.

336
00:20:04,578 --> 00:20:06,288
Are you sure you're okay?

337
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:07,706
Sam?

338
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:09,917
Sam.

339
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:16,423
Attorney Matias. Control your client.

340
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,344
Give me back my children.

341
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:23,055
Rebecca, calm down.

342
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:25,682
Order.

343
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:29,019
Counsels, control your clients.

344
00:20:29,102 --> 00:20:30,187
I'm warning you.

345
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,775
Aurora, you're a demon. You're a liar.

346
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:36,610
Why did you take my children away from me?

347
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,153
Give me back my children.

348
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,446
- You don't have a right.
- Order.

349
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,698
Stop it already, Rebecca.

350
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,367
God, I was right.

351
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,910
You're still not cured.

352
00:20:44,993 --> 00:20:47,621
You still can't control your tantrums.

353
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:49,164
You thought you could use
my condition against me,

354
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,666
but I am cured now.

355
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:53,293
Order. Order.

356
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:56,255
Give me back my children.

357
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,756
Calm down.

358
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,594
You're a liar. You're the devil.
Where did you take my children?

359
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:05,347
Why did you take them away from me?
You have no right.

360
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,641
She's still sick in the head.

361
00:21:07,724 --> 00:21:10,310
How can we believe what she's saying?

362
00:21:10,394 --> 00:21:12,020
- You're a liar.
- Rebecca…

363
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,272
Liar.

364
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,650
Give me back my children.

365
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,402
Rebecca, stop it.

366
00:21:18,485 --> 00:21:19,820
Sit down.

367
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:20,737
Calm down.

368
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,625
Rebecca, what? Do you want
to be cited for contempt?

369
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,753
Good thing Judge Cordova didn't get mad.

370
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,047
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, Attorney.

371
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:41,174
I snapped when I saw Auntie Aurora.

372
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,676
That's their strategy.

373
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:44,636
To get you mad, so you blow your top,

374
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,972
and make it show that you're not yet well.

375
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:52,436
Use this 15-minute break given
by the judge

376
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,187
to calm your head.

377
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,023
Because when we go back inside,

378
00:21:56,106 --> 00:21:58,358
Atty. Santiago will cross-examine you

379
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,651
and you should be calm.

380
00:22:06,366 --> 00:22:08,285
Excuse me, I just need to answer this.

381
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,917
Calm down, Larry.

382
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,086
How can I calm down, Auro?

383
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,756
You are being accused of kidnapping.

384
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,383
And the two kids you kidnapped

385
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:24,843
are with me and Barbara.

386
00:22:24,926 --> 00:22:26,887
Oh, please, Larry.

387
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,056
No one will know where the children are.

388
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,851
And besides, the court will
not listen to Rebecca.

389
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,436
<i>She threw a tantrum earlier,</i>

390
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:37,355
so they will think
that she's not yet fit to be a mother.

391
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:38,940
Just like you.

392
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:40,942
What did you say, Barry?

393
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:42,486
Nothing.

394
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,155
I said not like you.

395
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,366
You know that you are a very good mother.

396
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:50,869
<i>Anyway, Rebecca knows</i>

397
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,455
that I was one of the adopters, correct?

398
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,915
She read my letter.

399
00:22:54,998 --> 00:22:57,876
That got burned down in the estate.

400
00:22:57,959 --> 00:22:59,669
If Rebecca forces that,

401
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:02,881
my lawyers will insist she's hallucinated.

402
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,299
<i>That's our defense.</i>

403
00:23:04,382 --> 00:23:07,260
<i>That Rebecca is not yet totally healed,</i>

404
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:10,055
<i>so there's no truth to her claims.</i>

405
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:12,390
Okay, fine.

406
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,142
Just make sure
you don't involve me in that

407
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:16,186
because I have a name to protect.

408
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:18,480
I will take care of it.

409
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:22,234
Barry, dear. Are you still mad at me

410
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:25,237
for what I did to you and Galvan?

411
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,656
I'm really sorry, Barry.

412
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:31,284
It's water under the bridge.

413
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:34,871
But, I just want you
to know my stand on this.

414
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,208
Yes, I have grown to love Rebecca's baby,

415
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,837
but I am willing
to return her child to her.

416
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:44,131
Wait, what?

417
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:46,925
<i>Barry, please.</i>

418
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:50,178
The twins are better off
with you and Larry.

419
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:56,143
Don't do anything
that could destroy my lawyer's strategy.

420
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,561
<i>Okay, fine.</i>

421
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:02,023
Just make sure I won't step
inside the courtroom.

422
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,900
I promise.

423
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:07,737
You can step on the moon more easily
than set foot here in the courtroom.

424
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,531
I'll win this.

425
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:26,631
Well, well, well…

426
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:30,177
If it isn't the little lawyer.

427
00:24:31,511 --> 00:24:34,097
Let's be frank with each other,
Small Attorney.

428
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:36,850
Don't waste your time.

429
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,644
I have the best lawyer
in town, so walk away

430
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:45,066
with those little feet of yours

431
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:47,068
while you still can.

432
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,949
It's Attorney Lilet Matias, Ms. Aurora.

433
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,120
And yes, Ma'am Aurora. I am small,

434
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,915
but I have fought giants like you

435
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,791
several times.

436
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,170
I'm sorry.

437
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:08,632
But, no. It's a big no.

438
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,635
I am not walking away

439
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,846
because Rebecca will win

440
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,266
and there's nothing you can do
but return her twins.

441
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,614
Please raise your legs, ma'am.

442
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:33,823
George, it hurts.

443
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:36,368
Just be patient.

444
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:37,869
We're here already.

445
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,876
- Sam, relax.
- Doc, it hurts.

446
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,127
Okay, just a second.

447
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:47,462
I'll just check the baby.

448
00:25:55,303 --> 00:25:56,554
Sam…

449
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,848
Since you felt your tummy contract,

450
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,225
how many times did it happen again?

451
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:02,435
It keeps on happening.

452
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:06,398
And it won't end.

453
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,275
Okay.

454
00:26:08,358 --> 00:26:11,653
What's the interval of the contractions?

455
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:14,489
Is it twenty minutes?
Fifteen minutes? Tell me.

456
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,200
I think every two minutes,

457
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,493
and the last one

458
00:26:18,576 --> 00:26:21,288
feels like two minutes and continuously.

459
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,957
Hold on, okay? I will just check.

460
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:28,920
Okay, just relax.

461
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,506
I'll just check
how many centimeters it is.

462
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,383
Take a deep breath.

463
00:26:33,466 --> 00:26:35,010
Doc, am I going to give birth?

464
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,221
Usually, with the first baby,

465
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:42,142
it's either two weeks advanced or delayed.

466
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,478
Okay, but since it's your
due date already,

467
00:26:45,562 --> 00:26:49,733
you could give birth
at any time of the day, okay?

468
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:50,650
Relax.

469
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:53,069
So, don't forget to bring

470
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:55,447
your baby's to-go things.

471
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:57,574
I've already prepared for that

472
00:26:57,657 --> 00:26:59,492
since her tummy is just five months old.

473
00:27:01,703 --> 00:27:03,830
It seems we'll soon see each other, baby.

474
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:15,633
Pelvic exam, ultrasound, and hysteroscopy.

475
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,761
All these are not 100 percent accurate

476
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,304
to say you've given birth.

477
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:22,057
Were you made aware of the implications

478
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,142
of these tests, Miss Witness?

479
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,770
Objection, Your Honor.

480
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:28,855
My client is not a medical practitioner

481
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,232
to competently answer the question.

482
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,193
She is a patient.

483
00:27:33,276 --> 00:27:35,695
Your Honor, if the good counsel
is listening,

484
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:37,280
then she should have heard

485
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,908
that I rephrased the question

486
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:43,453
and it only requires a yes or no answer

487
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:46,915
based on the personal experience
of the witness.

488
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:48,249
Simple.

489
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,918
Overruled.

490
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,045
Miss Witness, answer the question.

491
00:27:54,089 --> 00:27:55,215
Yes.

492
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,175
Thank you, your Honor.

493
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,968
If that's the case, Ms. Witness,

494
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:01,221
the doctors who examined you,

495
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:05,100
they didn't tell you that results

496
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:06,768
were 100 percent accurate. Yes?

497
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:08,937
No.

498
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:12,899
And they didn't tell you
that you definitely gave birth

499
00:28:12,982 --> 00:28:15,151
to twins, for that matter?

500
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:16,945
Yes.

501
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,115
You admit it during direct examination,

502
00:28:20,198 --> 00:28:21,741
and we also obtained records

503
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:25,703
that you were diagnosed with schizophrenia

504
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:29,958
at the "alleged" time
that you gave birth, yes?

505
00:28:31,126 --> 00:28:32,877
Yes, but I am well now.

506
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,130
Are you sure you're well?

507
00:28:35,713 --> 00:28:37,090
Yes, I am.

508
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,844
You don't hear someone whispering to you,

509
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:42,971
see something else,

510
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,474
or feel that something is
crawling on your body?

511
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:47,976
Objection, Your Honor.

512
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:49,310
Compounding questions.

513
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:53,606
Your Honor, the witness is
accusing my client

514
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,067
of kidnapping her children

515
00:28:56,151 --> 00:28:59,279
whom she can't even remember
ever giving birth to.

516
00:28:59,362 --> 00:29:01,156
It is only right that we ask

517
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,784
if she is still experiencing
symptoms of her past ailment.

518
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:07,495
It is possible that she is
still hallucinating

519
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:09,038
up to this point.

520
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:12,584
In fact, part of that hallucination

521
00:29:12,667 --> 00:29:16,379
is her giving birth to twins.

522
00:29:16,463 --> 00:29:19,966
Overruled, but one question
at a time, Attorney Santiago.

523
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,301
Yes, Your Honor.

524
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:23,052
Go ahead, Miss Witness.

525
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:25,388
You may answer the first question.

526
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:31,102
I don't hear any whispers.

527
00:29:31,811 --> 00:29:34,105
In fact, there are no more symptoms

528
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:36,566
of my illness.

529
00:29:36,649 --> 00:29:39,152
But, your records show

530
00:29:39,235 --> 00:29:41,780
that you keep going back to your doctor.

531
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:45,658
That means it's possible
that you had a relapse,

532
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,996
or you could experience it at that time

533
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,873
whenever your illness comes back, right?

534
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,709
Objection, Your Honor.

535
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:57,128
Again, my client is not competent

536
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,005
to answer the question.

537
00:29:59,506 --> 00:30:00,840
And as mentioned,

538
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,176
the prosecution
will be presenting witnesses

539
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,304
who have the authority
to answer the question.

540
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:08,389
The defense counsel should know better.

541
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,725
Again, Your Honor,

542
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,978
if the good counsel
was just listening carefully,

543
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,605
then she should have heard

544
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:18,149
that I rephrased the question

545
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,277
and it merely requires a yes or no answer

546
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,739
based on the experience of the witness.

547
00:30:24,823 --> 00:30:25,657
Simple.

548
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,492
Enough, counsels.

549
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,952
Approach the bench.

550
00:30:38,753 --> 00:30:41,047
Barbara, are you really serious?

551
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:43,174
Are you willing to return the children?

552
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:48,346
Well, if my name gets dragged
into this whole mess, then yes.

553
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,934
I don't think Aurora can protect us.

554
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,144
We will get involved here.

555
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:58,231
That's why I'm just preparing myself.

556
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,192
You know what, Hillary?

557
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,529
I know this is difficult for us

558
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:07,866
because those kids are practically ours.

559
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:11,536
Of course, we already invested our time

560
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:13,413
and love for them.

561
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,667
But, are you willing to go to jail

562
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:21,629
just in case Aurora loses

563
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,339
and we get involved here?

564
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:25,258
You know what, Barbara?

565
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,802
This is probably going
to the first time and the last time

566
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,470
that I am going to agree with you

567
00:31:29,554 --> 00:31:31,723
because you're right.

568
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,434
That's why we need to know

569
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:36,811
what's happening inside the court

570
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:41,482
so we'll know and we can prepare for it.

571
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:42,901
That's right.

572
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,653
That's why I know

573
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,406
what's happening in the court.

574
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:49,616
You do?

575
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:52,952
How?

576
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,836
False alarm, Sam.

577
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,713
There's no cervical dilation

578
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,298
and your baby is stable.

579
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,175
Let's put this down carefully, okay?

580
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,135
- Careful.
- So, Doc…

581
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,929
I'll still give birth next week?

582
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:13,348
Most likely, yes.

583
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,184
You probably got stressed and overwhelmed.

584
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:21,356
That's why you had
Braxton-Hicks contractions.

585
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:24,275
She's stressed, Doc.

586
00:32:24,359 --> 00:32:26,444
She's worrying about her sister.

587
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:29,364
Sam, listen to me.

588
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:31,783
You have to focus on yourself

589
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:33,117
and your baby too.

590
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,911
Avoid thinking

591
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,789
about any stressful things around you.

592
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,873
Okay?

593
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:42,919
Why?

594
00:32:43,836 --> 00:32:44,921
Why the face?

595
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,382
Nothing, I just got excited.

596
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,969
I thought I'd finally see the baby.

597
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:54,389
Me too.

598
00:32:54,472 --> 00:32:55,598
But, don't worry,

599
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:58,184
all you have to do is wait
for another week.

600
00:33:01,229 --> 00:33:02,647
We will be waiting.

601
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:16,077
If you don't stop quarreling,

602
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,913
I will cite you for contempt.

603
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,416
Do we understand each other?

604
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,209
- Yes, Your Honor.
- Yes, Your Honor.

605
00:33:23,918 --> 00:33:24,836
Good.

606
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,342
Ms. Witness, you claim you have twins.

607
00:33:31,426 --> 00:33:32,593
What were they?

608
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:36,597
Two girls or two boys?
Or a girl and a boy?

609
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,601
What's happening there?

610
00:33:42,186 --> 00:33:44,814
Your Honor, off the record.

611
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,858
We already know where the kids are.

612
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:50,945
And my client will be filing
a separate petition for habeas corpus

613
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,156
against the individual
in custody of the children.

614
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,718
So…

615
00:34:14,802 --> 00:34:17,013
Sam will give birth next week, Kate?

616
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:19,223
No, George.

617
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:23,227
Based on her symptoms
and the baby's position,

618
00:34:23,311 --> 00:34:24,979
she could give birth at any time.

619
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:27,148
What?

620
00:34:28,274 --> 00:34:30,526
So, I need to carry out my plan.

621
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,487
As in any moment?

622
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:34,947
Yes.

623
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,949
So, you better make sure

624
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:39,869
you're ready with all the things to do.

625
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,789
Kate, I'm ready.

626
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,415
I've been ready since last month.

627
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:48,878
It looks like I'll soon see
my Baby Gilbert.

628
00:34:51,964 --> 00:34:54,759
A petition for habeas corpus,
Attorney Matias?

629
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,427
Yes, Your Honor.

630
00:34:56,511 --> 00:34:58,971
Here are the pieces
of evidence that we found.

631
00:34:59,806 --> 00:35:02,058
A certified copy of the adoption papers

632
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,769
both signed by Aurora Palacios

633
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,521
and the adoptive mothers.

634
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,565
Noted, Attorney Matias.

635
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,485
Anyway, this is off the record.

636
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:15,780
That's a separate petition you are filing.

637
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:18,991
But, as to whether or not
you will be presenting

638
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:22,662
the same evidence
for this kidnapping case,

639
00:35:22,745 --> 00:35:24,997
I will leave that up to you.

640
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,209
Continue the cross, Attorney Santiago.

641
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,629
No further questions, Your Honor.

642
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:58,698
Are you okay now?

643
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,533
Does your tummy still hurt?

644
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:03,202
Not that much. It's okay now.

645
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,707
So, Doc said you can go home now,

646
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,418
but I have a suggestion.

647
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,753
When we go home,

648
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:15,631
there will for sure be news
about what happened in court.

649
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:17,508
You might get stressed again.

650
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:20,595
So, if it's okay with you,

651
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:25,224
let's go somewhere to relax.

652
00:36:27,685 --> 00:36:30,021
I think I know this already…

653
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,523
Out of town? Overnight?

654
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:33,983
Yes.

655
00:36:34,066 --> 00:36:35,693
Just like before?

656
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:37,153
What? Are you game?

657
00:36:42,116 --> 00:36:44,493
How did they find those adoption papers?

658
00:36:44,577 --> 00:36:47,246
Lawyers have teams to investigate for us.

659
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:49,373
So, what do we do now, Rona?

660
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,210
My friends must not get involved.

661
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:53,711
We promised them.

662
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:55,588
You promised me.

663
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:57,048
Relax, Aurora.

664
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:59,467
If Rebecca files a petition,

665
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:01,302
we will oppose it, of course.

666
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:04,138
The confidentiality of adoption
proceedings

667
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:05,598
is protected by the law.

668
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,600
Attorney Matias and Rebecca

669
00:37:07,683 --> 00:37:11,771
will have to establish
credible grounds to override it.

670
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,650
You're missing the point, Rona.

671
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:18,486
Barry and Larry don't want their names

672
00:37:18,569 --> 00:37:19,946
dragged into this mess.

673
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,116
The habeas corpus petition
must not go through.

674
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,036
Here's an idea.

675
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,830
Do whatever you have to do to put a stop

676
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:32,166
to what the other party

677
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:35,586
of that small attorney wants to do.

678
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,505
Excuse me?

679
00:37:38,005 --> 00:37:41,467
You forgot how I got where I am, Aurora.

680
00:37:41,550 --> 00:37:43,094
It's true.

681
00:37:43,177 --> 00:37:45,846
I am obnoxious. Arrogant, yes. Cunning.

682
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,431
But, I don't play dirty.

683
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:49,350
I can win this case

684
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,520
without resorting to those tactics.

685
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,232
You're paid to do what your client wants.

686
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,650
Right?

687
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,151
How much?

688
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:01,904
Don't you dare, Aurora,

689
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,657
if you don't want me
to leave you in this fight.

690
00:38:05,241 --> 00:38:06,826
I will make you win

691
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:09,829
without resorting to any dirty tricks.

692
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:13,040
I will fight that you did everything

693
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,209
to protect your beloved grandchildren,

694
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:17,461
and that you did everything
for their safety

695
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,839
because their mother is mentally unfit.

696
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:24,218
Besides, Rebecca already admitted
during direct examination

697
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,763
that she was schizophrenic
at the time that she gave birth.

698
00:38:27,847 --> 00:38:29,849
That's all I needed to win this.

699
00:38:29,932 --> 00:38:33,602
So, you'd better tell Barry and Larry

700
00:38:33,686 --> 00:38:35,855
that whether they like it or not,

701
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,774
they will have to fight along with you.

702
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:49,285
Auntie Aurora distributed…

703
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:54,206
my children to Auntie Larry
and Auntie Barry?

704
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,250
Oh, my god.

705
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,087
I thought it was just Auntie Larry.

706
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:02,173
How can she do that?

707
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:03,799
No…

708
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:06,218
Auntie Aurora is really an animal!

709
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,681
She separated my twins.

710
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,600
How did you know about this, Attorney?

711
00:39:13,267 --> 00:39:15,519
Rebecca, my staff are good,

712
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,146
and Jericho and his soldier colleagues

713
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,190
are a big help.

714
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:23,402
Do you think there's a chance

715
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:26,072
that the judge will grant our petition?

716
00:39:26,155 --> 00:39:28,616
Well, it's a 50-50 chance.

717
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:32,578
It all depends
on the witnesses and evidence

718
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:35,414
that we can prove in court.

719
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,208
Let's hope for the best.

720
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,501
Let's hope for the best?

721
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:39,752
What if…

722
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,546
What if Auntie Aurora still declines?

723
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:46,884
Attorney, they have a lot of money.

724
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:49,095
They have a lot of connections.

725
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:51,138
They can easily escape with my children.

726
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,432
They'll take them away
from me and never return them.

727
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,267
I can't take that.

728
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,062
My God, my children…

729
00:39:58,145 --> 00:39:59,730
Do you know where they are?

730
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,565
Do you know
where they took my children, Attorney?

731
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,776
Do you know, Attorney?

732
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,653
Rebecca…

733
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,405
My children.

734
00:40:07,488 --> 00:40:09,865
- Rebecca…
- Where did my children go?

735
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,075
Rebecca.

736
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,457
Larry! Barry!

737
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,251
Thanks for waiting for me.

738
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:28,008
So…

739
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:30,136
Any news?

740
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,179
All is well.

741
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,764
My lawyer is on it.

742
00:40:34,974 --> 00:40:35,933
Really?

743
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,978
No mention of…

744
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:40,104
What's that term…

745
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:42,106
Habeas corpus?

746
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:46,652
What? No.

747
00:40:48,195 --> 00:40:49,196
Liar.

748
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:55,119
We know what happened in court.

749
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:58,122
And my client will be filing

750
00:40:58,205 --> 00:41:00,458
a separate petition for habeas corpus

751
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:02,626
against the individual
in custody of the children.

752
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,838
A petition for habeas corpus,
Attorney Matias?

753
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,009
So, please, Aurora.

754
00:41:10,092 --> 00:41:11,886
Don't lie anymore.

755
00:41:16,557 --> 00:41:18,100
Listen to me.

756
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,270
We've already expected this.

757
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:24,273
Whether the habeas corpus will
be granted or not,

758
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:26,150
they will do everything.

759
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:28,694
They'll do everything
to destroy you or break you.

760
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,322
But, will you agree to that?

761
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,824
Will you let them destroy your character,

762
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,202
so you won't be able
to get your children back?

763
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,539
No…

764
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:42,875
Then don't give them the power.

765
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,296
Think about your children
that they took from you.

766
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,839
Focus on that.

767
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:54,595
Attorney Santiago will try to attack you

768
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:56,388
again and again.

769
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,975
She will destroy your character
and your mental health.

770
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:03,604
So, Rebecca, let me repeat it.
Will you let them do that to you?

771
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:05,397
No. No.

772
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:15,241
Barbara and I have already
reached a unanimous decision.

773
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,577
We will return the twins to Rebecca.

774
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,288
You traitors.

775
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:24,083
Stop calling me your child.

776
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:27,211
Once I get my twins, we're done.

777
00:42:28,170 --> 00:42:30,464
Your sister said we need to leave now.

778
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,924
<i>What's the problem, Mom?</i>

779
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:34,510
<i>Are there killings</i>
<i>with the Palacioses again</i>

780
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,637
<i>and George is involved here?</i>

781
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:41,308
NEXT EPISODE

782
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:42,560
<i>George.</i>

783
00:42:45,813 --> 00:42:47,314
George.

784
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,983
<i>You need your mommy.</i>

785
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,151
You're looking for her.
