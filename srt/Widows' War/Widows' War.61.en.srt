1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,807
Is Rebecca your daughter with Orly?

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:19,394
Yes. Orly and I have a daughter,
and it's Rebecca.

3
00:00:19,477 --> 00:00:21,604
If you're not hurting
and you accept Rebecca, fine.

4
00:00:21,688 --> 00:00:25,066
But, I can never accept her.

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,194
<i>I told you, you're stressing yourself out.</i>

6
00:00:28,278 --> 00:00:31,489
This is not healthy anymore.
My OB is available for me anytime.

7
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,783
That's why we should go.
I need to make sure that my baby…

8
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,744
my godchild is well and fine.

9
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,953
I loved you, Aurora.

10
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:38,413
Yes, Amando.

11
00:00:38,496 --> 00:00:41,166
But, you knew I could never love you.

12
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:42,792
You are just a mere helper.

13
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,545
<i>I can now push through with my plan.</i>

14
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:46,504
What plan?

15
00:00:46,588 --> 00:00:48,757
I wanted to have a gender reveal party.

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,133
Because you know,

17
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,260
I wasn't able to give my baby boy a party.

18
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:53,553
So, I'll throw one for your baby boy.

19
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,348
- I'm having a baby boy.
- We're having a baby boy.

20
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,977
<i>It's not our baby, Samantha.</i>

21
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,353
<i>It's my baby.</i>

22
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:05,565
These were the skid marks taken
on the Sto. Niño Parish Street

23
00:01:05,648 --> 00:01:07,984
and the chemical composition of the tire.

24
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:11,029
This is the tire from the car
Ms. Trano rented.

25
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:11,946
It's a match.

26
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,284
Yes, Sofia. I ran Francis over.

27
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,496
You're not leaving.
You have to stay. This is bad, Mom.

28
00:01:19,579 --> 00:01:22,499
What do you mean bad, huh?
Go bad your face.

29
00:01:23,541 --> 00:01:25,627
You little liar…

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:28,755
So, it's true
that Rebecca is your daughter.

31
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:30,965
I have no choice before, Barry.

32
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,220
All this time I thought
I was your most trusted friend

33
00:01:35,303 --> 00:01:37,597
for you to tell all your secrets to.

34
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,140
I'm sorry.

35
00:01:39,224 --> 00:01:42,268
Dad, it's Mommy. She escaped.

36
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,687
Alert all security. Now.

37
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:45,730
Yes.

38
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:49,109
PREVIOUSLY

39
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:52,237
George, where are you taking me?

40
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,032
We'll go shopping.
We'll buy things for the baby.

41
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:57,575
Where is Bill?

42
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,119
- George, wait.
- I said we're about to go.

43
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:02,580
You know I need
to attend to a lot of things.

44
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,958
We still haven't found Rebecca.

45
00:02:05,041 --> 00:02:07,168
Mother and I are still not okay.

46
00:02:07,252 --> 00:02:10,547
Sis, remember what Dr. Flores said?

47
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,382
You should avoid stress, right?

48
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:17,095
Can we just focus on the baby,
just for today?

49
00:02:21,933 --> 00:02:23,893
Okay, where is Bill?

50
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,944
- Sam?
- Where are you going?

51
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:36,322
You're still under investigation, right?

52
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,580
I'm sorry, Barry,

53
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:50,295
if I hid my real relationship
with Rebecca from you.

54
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:55,592
I will only accept your apology if…

55
00:02:56,259 --> 00:02:59,178
you tell me other secrets

56
00:02:59,262 --> 00:03:00,889
that you haven't told me

57
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,308
like…

58
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:05,435
let's see…

59
00:03:07,228 --> 00:03:09,105
about Orly.

60
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,858
Is it true that he committed suicide?

61
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:14,569
Is it true that he overdosed?

62
00:03:15,486 --> 00:03:16,404
Tell me.

63
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,205
It's none of your business
where I want to go.

64
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:28,708
Until you have filed a case against me,

65
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,461
you can't stop me
from going where I want to go!

66
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,338
No, you're not leaving.

67
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:34,339
Give me that.

68
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,299
- Give me.
- No, you can't…

69
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:38,384
Give me.

70
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,428
Don't steal my keys from me.

71
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:45,433
You're really a pest.

72
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,518
Try and hurt Sam

73
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:48,937
- What?
- and you'll answer to me.

74
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,439
What, you'll both gang up on me?

75
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:53,566
Fine, come closer.

76
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,276
Come on and come closer.

77
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,029
George.

78
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:01,741
And I will kill Sam's baby.

79
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:05,787
Wait…

80
00:04:07,372 --> 00:04:11,000
Why are you so interested lately

81
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,964
in the details of my affair with Orly?

82
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:24,555
You were gone for a year.

83
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,015
You went to Europe

84
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,643
the same year Rebecca was born.

85
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,520
How did you know that?

86
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,024
What really happened to you in Europe?

87
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,694
Why were you gone for a year

88
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:42,448
and when you got back here
you were so fat?

89
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:43,449
What happened?

90
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,412
Barry…

91
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,582
Are you backstabbing me?

92
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:53,751
What?

93
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:56,421
What are you talking about?

94
00:04:56,504 --> 00:04:59,132
You were pestering me…

95
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,052
about my daughter with Orly

96
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,890
including my sabbatical for a year.

97
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:13,688
And then all of a sudden,
here comes Samantha asking me…

98
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,817
if Rebecca is my child with Orly.

99
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,236
I knew it.

100
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,822
Good thing I got Galvan's gun.

101
00:05:22,905 --> 00:05:24,574
I knew I'd be needing this.

102
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,576
- Vivian!
- Ma'am, Sir is calling you.

103
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:30,246
Galvan, I already searched
your entire office.

104
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,331
It's really not there.

105
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,207
It's impossible that my gun isn't there.

106
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,959
I hid it there.

107
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,336
Maybe it's in the room.

108
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,088
Where did you last use or place it?

109
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,883
It can't be lost.

110
00:05:41,966 --> 00:05:43,509
I need my gun.

111
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:45,678
So, don't come closer. Let me escape,

112
00:05:45,762 --> 00:05:48,139
or else I will kill Sam's baby.

113
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:54,145
It's you who is helping Sam.

114
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:58,232
Aurora, what are you talking about?

115
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,777
Why would I do that?

116
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:02,695
Because of money?

117
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,405
I'm already rich.

118
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,784
Because of power? I already have that…

119
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:08,951
Then what?

120
00:06:09,035 --> 00:06:10,495
I don't know.

121
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,665
Maybe you're one
of the people who finds pleasure

122
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,877
in seeing Aurora Palacios fall.

123
00:06:23,633 --> 00:06:26,094
Don't you dare use that on me or Sam.

124
00:06:26,177 --> 00:06:27,887
I will make you pay
for the rest of your life.

125
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,347
Oh, really?

126
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:31,349
Wow, big words.

127
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:34,310
Go ahead and try to stop me from escaping.

128
00:06:34,393 --> 00:06:36,604
Try to come close to me

129
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,148
and I will kill Sam's baby
so that it's two-in-one.

130
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,318
If I go to jail after this,

131
00:06:42,401 --> 00:06:44,862
at least I will be able to do what I want.

132
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:46,239
Sofia will be the only one left

133
00:06:46,322 --> 00:06:48,658
in the next generation of Palacioses.

134
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:53,079
You never changed Aurora.

135
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,415
Every time you are cornered
because of your foolishness,

136
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,376
you always accuse others.

137
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,253
And of all people,

138
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,838
you always make me your victim.

139
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,131
And why is that?

140
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,259
Is it because you're envious of me?

141
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:09,512
That's why you always want me to go down.

142
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:12,265
Excuse me?

143
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:15,560
Me, envious of you?

144
00:07:15,643 --> 00:07:19,939
Girl, I have no reason
to be envious of you.

145
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:23,651
You were never my level.

146
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,445
You are beneath me.

147
00:07:25,528 --> 00:07:28,030
Way, way beneath me.

148
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,538
You fool.

149
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,540
The moment I find out

150
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,126
you're betraying me,

151
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,422
I swear, I will kill you.

152
00:07:53,014 --> 00:07:54,348
Where are you going?

153
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,226
We're not yet over. Barbara.

154
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:00,813
Go ahead. Come closer.

155
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:02,565
What now?

156
00:08:02,648 --> 00:08:03,691
You're coming closer?

157
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:09,280
You will never hurt my baby.

158
00:08:09,363 --> 00:08:10,364
George…

159
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,745
George!

160
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,206
George. George. George.

161
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:21,167
Help. Help.

162
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,418
George.

163
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,512
Barbara.

164
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:36,557
What made you stop our slapping session?

165
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,976
What? Are you scared that…

166
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,105
your face won't respond to botox
at your next clinic appointment?

167
00:08:43,189 --> 00:08:46,359
Of course not. That is not true.

168
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,610
You know I just realized

169
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,654
that I'm at the losing end
if I fight with you.

170
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,323
You know my time is too precious

171
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:55,034
to use it to fight an old woman.

172
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:56,369
Go ahead.

173
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:58,329
Leave and never return.

174
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:02,083
Traitors like you
are never welcome in my kingdom.

175
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,752
Excuse me, I am not a traitor.

176
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,587
But, yes. I will leave.

177
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,422
Because no decent woman like me

178
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:09,924
would to set foot

179
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:12,635
in this slaughterhouse you call home.

180
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:14,178
Oh, yeah?

181
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,265
The queen of this slaughterhouse

182
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,059
will slaughter you the moment I find out

183
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:23,479
that you're the one helping Samantha.

184
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,274
Ouch.

185
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:28,651
Ma'am, don't hurt Ma'am Barbara.

186
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:37,034
- Help.
- Don't meddle, George.

187
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:38,536
- George.
- Don't meddle here.

188
00:09:38,619 --> 00:09:39,954
Don't meddle, George.

189
00:09:40,037 --> 00:09:41,247
Don't come closer,

190
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:42,957
or else I will kill Sam's baby,

191
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,293
just like how I killed her brother!

192
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:48,004
It was you?

193
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,591
You killed my brother.

194
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,009
Animal.

195
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:54,594
And you're next.

196
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,345
Don't come near me.

197
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:03,311
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

198
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,438
What's that? What's that?

199
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,118
Barry, were you shot?

200
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,245
No, no, no. I'm fine.

201
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,288
Are you all right?

202
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,333
I'm okay. Thank God.

203
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:26,876
Barry…

204
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:31,589
If I lose you, I will regret it
for the rest of my life.

205
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:34,634
I'm sorry if I called you a traitor.

206
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,596
It's okay. But please promise me…

207
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,931
don't think badly of me anymore.

208
00:10:41,015 --> 00:10:43,059
I will never betray you.

209
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,810
I know.

210
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:46,854
- I'm sorry, Barry.
- I'm sorry also.

211
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,774
George.

212
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,321
Let's go. I'll take you to the hospital.

213
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:58,157
No need. It's just
a graze wound on my shoulder.

214
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,785
Oh, my god.

215
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:03,954
Are you okay?

216
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:06,290
The gunshot came from the garage.

217
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,750
I'll check it first.

218
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,586
- Go inside while I clear the area.
- Okay.

219
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,171
Okay, let's go. Let's go.

220
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:15,341
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

221
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,218
- I'm really sorry.
- Where did the gunshot come from?

222
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,680
It's Vivian.

223
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:23,849
Help. Help.

224
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,686
Help.

225
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:30,523
Mommy.

226
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:32,191
Mommy, no.

227
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:36,112
Come on, I'll take you to the hospital.

228
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:37,655
- No need.
- What happened?

229
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,573
- It's George. She got shot.
- George, what happened?

230
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:40,950
Where's the car key? Give it to me.

231
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,535
- Go after Vivian.
- I'll take care of it.

232
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:44,662
- Let's go.
- Give it to me. Let's go.

233
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:46,455
Come on. Get in.

234
00:12:05,015 --> 00:12:06,100
Thank you, Jericho.

235
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,103
Are you okay?

236
00:12:09,186 --> 00:12:10,563
Thank you, Jericho.

237
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:15,609
George, thank you for saving my life.

238
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,696
You were in danger because of me.

239
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,741
Sis, I'm your baby's mommy.
I mean second mommy.

240
00:12:22,825 --> 00:12:25,244
Of course, I would do everything for him.

241
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:28,622
That Vivian is such an animal.

242
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,957
She should go to jail.

243
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,793
She should pay for killing my brother.

244
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:38,716
So, you already know

245
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,303
that it was Vivian
who ran over your brother?

246
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:46,474
I told you, it wasn't me.

247
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,942
You already knew
that Vivian confessed to Sofia,

248
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,278
but instead of telling me,

249
00:12:59,361 --> 00:13:01,906
you prioritized your bet.

250
00:13:01,989 --> 00:13:03,199
You're so greedy for money.

251
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:06,160
Uncle Galvan. Uncle Galvan.

252
00:13:06,243 --> 00:13:07,286
That's enough.

253
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:11,290
I wasn't able to go after Auntie Vivian.

254
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,626
This is your fault, Bill.

255
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,171
You let the potential mastermind escape.

256
00:13:17,254 --> 00:13:19,256
Dad, Mom is not the mastermind.

257
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,175
She could be, Sofia.

258
00:13:22,426 --> 00:13:23,594
Your mommy is a liar.

259
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:26,388
I think,

260
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,183
Francis wasn't the only one she killed.

261
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,270
- This is your fault.
- Uncle Galvan, stop it.

262
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,315
Ando, Cairo, take Bill out.

263
00:13:38,609 --> 00:13:39,860
You can all leave.

264
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,324
Samantha…

265
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:50,496
Won't you apologize to your mother-in-law?

266
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:54,500
No.

267
00:13:56,752 --> 00:13:58,587
You're really ruthless.

268
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,387
Apologize to Aurora now.

269
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:14,562
I said, apologize to Aurora.

270
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,564
I said, no.

271
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,612
Samantha, we have to be careful.

272
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:27,741
Definitely, Aurora will suspect me.

273
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,578
So, if we see each other in her house,

274
00:14:30,661 --> 00:14:32,371
we have to continue fighting

275
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:35,291
in front of family members,
household staff,

276
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,126
and anyone else.

277
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,669
We have to fight each other.

278
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,087
Do you understand me?

279
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,674
Okay.

280
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:44,758
Good.

281
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:49,972
Sir Galvan, good afternoon.

282
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,683
We found solid evidence

283
00:14:52,766 --> 00:14:54,602
against Vivian Trano.

284
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,272
And we're here to serve
the warrant of arrest.

285
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,773
You're late.

286
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,859
She has already escaped.

287
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,319
What?

288
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:06,030
Do you have an idea
of where she could possibly hide?

289
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:07,698
None.

290
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,367
I tried to go after her,
but I wasn't able to catch her.

291
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:12,953
Wait….

292
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:17,249
Ward, just tell us the truth.

293
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,752
I needed a companion that night.

294
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:24,340
That's why I went to the clubhouse.

295
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:27,718
I called Sofia and…

296
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:31,430
- we went to a motel.
- What?

297
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:34,600
I think I know how to find Vivian.

298
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,143
Give me your phone.

299
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,228
- No. No.
- Give me your phone.

300
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,648
I will install an app on it

301
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:42,691
so I will know where you're going.

302
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,444
I already made a promise
that it will never happen again, right?

303
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,112
- What promise?
- Hey.

304
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,822
- Please, Mom.
- Hey.

305
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:50,324
What's happening here?

306
00:15:50,407 --> 00:15:53,702
Dad, Mom wants to download
an app to trace me on my phone.

307
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,496
It's a tracking application.

308
00:15:55,579 --> 00:15:58,290
So we will know where you're going.

309
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,418
Vivian is right.

310
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:02,878
Give your phone to her.

311
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:05,297
Now!

312
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:06,715
Give it to me.

313
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,842
Give it to me.

314
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:16,308
Sir, that Trace Me app works both ways.

315
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:19,645
If Ms. Vivian can locate Sofia,

316
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,271
Sofia can do the same.

317
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,607
Sofia, can I borrow your phone?

318
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,150
No.

319
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:36,036
Paco…

320
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,541
I'm sorry, my son.

321
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:45,337
I never had the guts
to tell you the truth.

322
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,215
I was a coward

323
00:16:49,717 --> 00:16:52,803
and followed your mom's orders.

324
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:56,724
I got scared

325
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,685
that she might separate us.

326
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,736
Don't interfere here.

327
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:13,907
I will never apologize to your friend

328
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:17,369
because I know
you're behind all the killings here.

329
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,205
Will you really not stop
accusing me, Samantha?

330
00:17:22,416 --> 00:17:24,877
You will never slap me again.

331
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,379
I will never allow it.

332
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:32,009
I know, Vivian is just one
of those you gave orders to

333
00:17:32,092 --> 00:17:35,345
because you are responsible
for all the killings here….

334
00:17:36,096 --> 00:17:39,808
For Dad, Francis, Basil,

335
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,685
and even Rebecca's disappearance.

336
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,729
You are responsible for that.

337
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:47,524
Oh my gosh, Samantha…

338
00:17:48,150 --> 00:17:50,027
You know Aurora is right,

339
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:52,321
you are such a drama queen.

340
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,824
But, what did you just say?

341
00:17:56,992 --> 00:18:00,454
That Aurora can never hurt you again?

342
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,415
Well then, I'll do it for her.

343
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:13,383
And I will retaliate for her.

344
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,386
You have no right to hurt my friend.

345
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,476
She killed your baby, Georgina.

346
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,812
And now you're taking her side?

347
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:28,816
We both lost our children
because of that woman.

348
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:30,776
Don't be stupid, Georgina.

349
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,278
Don't side with a killer.

350
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,156
Is that what you want, Auntie Aurora?

351
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,658
For me to be on your side?

352
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,827
That will never happen, Auntie Aurora.

353
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,123
That's enough.

354
00:18:44,998 --> 00:18:48,877
Don't fight with those pathetic squatters.

355
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,296
You'll just waste your time.
Come on, let's go.

356
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,340
Let's go.

357
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:05,394
Bill, it's your fault too.

358
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:07,437
You should have told Sir Galvan

359
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,731
when you found out about Ms. Vivian.

360
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,360
Go and rest now.

361
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:25,164
Why is Sir Amando crying
over Sir Paco's picture?

362
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,877
Remember Sir Amando's love letter?

363
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,878
Yes.

364
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:33,797
He loved our boss for 50 years.

365
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,799
Could it be…

366
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,430
that he and Ma'am Aurora
had a relationship

367
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,265
and Sir Paco was their son?

368
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:48,103
Sofia… are you going to protect
your mommy?

369
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,521
She fooled you.

370
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,482
She made you believe her lies.

371
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:56,278
She even made you lie,
so she could get away with it.

372
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,698
Give your phone to Sergeant Royales.

373
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:01,116
No, Dad.

374
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,035
I'm going to call Mom.

375
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,661
I'm going to make sure
that she comes back.

376
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:07,664
Do you think she'll surrender?

377
00:20:07,748 --> 00:20:09,583
Dad, please.

378
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:11,877
I'm scared for mom's safety.

379
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,296
If Sergeant Royales catches her,

380
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:18,634
she might fight back.
She might get shot and die.

381
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:20,469
We will not do that.

382
00:20:21,053 --> 00:20:22,930
Stop overthinking.

383
00:20:23,513 --> 00:20:25,432
Give your phone to him.

384
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,267
Now.

385
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:28,894
No, Dad.

386
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,521
Sofia,

387
00:20:32,522 --> 00:20:34,316
if you won't cooperate with them,

388
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,902
they could sue you
for obstruction of justice.

389
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,153
You will be jailed.

390
00:20:43,283 --> 00:20:45,160
Sam? Sam, my child?

391
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,162
Mother… Mother…

392
00:20:48,121 --> 00:20:49,122
George got shot.

393
00:20:49,206 --> 00:20:51,291
I took her to the hospital.

394
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,168
Vivian shot her.

395
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,589
That woman is really a demon.

396
00:20:57,673 --> 00:20:58,799
God forgive me,

397
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,510
but I hope Sergeant Royales
doesn't only catch her.

398
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:02,844
I hope they kill her.

399
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,516
I want her to pay
for what she did to Francis.

400
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:15,649
Mother, George saved my life and my baby.

401
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:17,734
She took the bullet
that was supposed to be for me.

402
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:19,903
Is that so?

403
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:23,198
George, you did that?

404
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:25,617
Thank you so much.

405
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,494
Thank you, George.

406
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,666
<i>It's only your baby that</i>
<i>I want to save, Sam.</i>

407
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,459
<i>My son.</i>

408
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,878
<i>It's fate that your baby is also a boy</i>

409
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,673
<i>because he will be my baby Gilbert,</i>

410
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:43,302
<i>Named after my father whom</i>
<i>we lost because of your family.</i>

411
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:01,653
Thank you. We need to go, sir.

412
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:05,782
Jericho…

413
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,453
Will you go with them to arrest Vivian?

414
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:11,747
No.

415
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:13,623
I'm going to look for Rebecca.

416
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,250
My colleagues are waiting for me.

417
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:17,878
Go.

418
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,130
Find my niece.

419
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:22,007
I'll go ahead.

420
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:40,150
What are you whispering about?

421
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,950
Sir…

422
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:52,662
we're talking about Ms. Vivian's escape.

423
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,582
Vivian's escape?

424
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,336
- Why?
- Didn't you know?

425
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,671
She was the one who ran Francis over.

426
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:04,132
There are talks here

427
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:07,219
that she's the mastermind.

428
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:13,850
Hello?

429
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,902
Vivian must be arrested

430
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:26,738
so she can pay for her sins
against Francis.

431
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,365
Don't worry, Mother.

432
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,575
I'm sure she will be caught

433
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:32,410
because there's an app
on hers and Sofia's phones

434
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:34,287
that will show us her location.

435
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:36,331
Really?

436
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,291
Yes, Jericho mentioned it to me

437
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,210
when he was updating me about Rebe…

438
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:46,007
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:51,721 --> 00:23:55,308
I'm sorry
about my reaction towards Rebecca.

440
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:59,729
I still can't accept
that Aurora had a child with Orly.

441
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,817
I shouldn't have involved Rebecca
in my anger.

442
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:07,612
Rebecca is innocent.

443
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,117
Thank you, Mother.

444
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,090
Sir Amando?

445
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,427
Jericho, have you found Rebecca?

446
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:32,512
Not yet.

447
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,432
Is there any news from General Alejaga?

448
00:24:37,225 --> 00:24:38,643
Still nothing.

449
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:41,188
I've been calling him from time to time.

450
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,856
They're looking for her,

451
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,400
but they still can't find Rebecca.

452
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,404
Thank you for worrying about Rebecca.

453
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:52,741
She is Aurora's daughter.

454
00:24:52,824 --> 00:24:55,827
I will never stop worrying about her.

455
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,831
What if Vivian gets ahead of us?

456
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,376
What if she finds her and kills her?

457
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,129
Aurora can't take it.

458
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,799
Auntie Vivian already escaped.

459
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,761
She will prioritize going
to a faraway place

460
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:14,429
to hide rather than look
for Rebecca and kill her.

461
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:17,933
What if Vivian gave orders
to her accomplice?

462
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:25,440
I hope they arrest Vivian…

463
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:29,444
right away so we can get justice
for what happened to Francis

464
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,781
and end all the troubles here.

465
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,326
Mother, I think Vivian,

466
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,663
Juliet, and Iñigo are just a few

467
00:25:39,746 --> 00:25:41,790
who got orders from the mastermind.

468
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,709
And I think the killings here
didn't just start with Basil

469
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:47,003
getting poisoned.

470
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:49,756
Before Dad, there were already killings.

471
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,134
What do you mean?

472
00:25:55,929 --> 00:25:58,139
Aurora is evil.

473
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,352
She is the reason my husband died.

474
00:26:02,936 --> 00:26:04,479
Why didn't you sue her?

475
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:07,065
Because I have no evidence against her.

476
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:11,111
But, with your father's case,

477
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,990
I can still help you to find evidence.

478
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,285
The killings here started a long time ago

479
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,830
and they only have one common denominator.

480
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,499
Mom Aurora.

481
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,584
She is the mastermind.

482
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:34,801
Did you see her outfit?

483
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:36,761
- I know right?
- My god.

484
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,139
- Where have you been?
- I don't know…

485
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:42,225
Wow…

486
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,687
You ask as if you have…

487
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,398
a relationship with Aurora.

488
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,734
Anyway, just so you know,

489
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:52,944
we came from our sorority meeting.

490
00:26:58,158 --> 00:27:00,869
Rebecca is missing,
and yet, you prioritized going out?

491
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:04,039
It seems like you're not worried.

492
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:07,250
Maybe Sam is right.

493
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:10,170
You have something to do
with Rebecca's disappearance.

494
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:11,129
You are just hiding it.

495
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,798
How dare you, you bastard.

496
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:16,926
Auro, let me handle this.

497
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,598
You…

498
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,434
Peasants…

499
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:46,414
Hello, who are you? You're annoying.

500
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,208
Mom, it's me.

501
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,877
I'm using the guard's phone.
I've been calling you and texting you.

502
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,338
What do you need from me, Sofia?

503
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:57,258
Mom, Sergeant Royales is tracking you
in the Trace Me App.

504
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:58,718
What?

505
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:02,138
Aurora has nothing to do
with Rebecca's disappearance.

506
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,974
Just because we were out,

507
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,018
that doesn't mean she's not worried.

508
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:10,522
In fact, she's always talking
to General Alejaga.

509
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,899
Don't defend Auntie Aurora

510
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:16,403
because even if she has nothing to do
with Rebecca's disappearance,

511
00:28:16,486 --> 00:28:17,904
she's still at fault.

512
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:23,118
I begged her not to bring
Rebecca to the mental facility.

513
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:25,578
I would have taken care of her,

514
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,123
but she refused to listen.

515
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,291
Jericho.

516
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:38,591
Why are you yelling at Barbara?

517
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:50,061
You gave him your cellphone?

518
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:52,230
Are you really a traitor to me, Sofia?

519
00:28:52,313 --> 00:28:53,898
Mom, no.

520
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,025
Dad told Sergeant Royales
about the Trace Me app.

521
00:28:56,109 --> 00:28:58,319
What do you need from me?

522
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,071
You're useless.

523
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:03,658
I'm calling you
to tell you to turn off your phone

524
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,452
so they can't trace you.

525
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:14,502
I'm just explaining, Uncle Galvan.

526
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:18,465
Next time, talk properly.

527
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:19,966
Especially to Barbara.

528
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:23,094
If you don't want us to fight.

529
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,638
Now, leave.

530
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,183
And you too, Amando.

531
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,358
Barbara, are you good?

532
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:40,653
I'm fine.

533
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,449
Thanks for your concern.

534
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,546
Galvan…

535
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,549
Why are you here?

536
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,845
Were you looking for someone?

537
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:07,931
I'm looking for Sofia.

538
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:18,691
Hello? Sergeant Royales.

539
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:23,488
That's good.

540
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:26,324
Arrest that woman at once.

541
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:57,856
Ms. Trano.

542
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,361
You had better surrender.

543
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:06,239
You will never catch me alive.

544
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:10,785
We'll kill each other first
before you catch me.

545
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,292
Ms. Trano, you had better surrender.

546
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,769
Sir, we recovered the car earlier,

547
00:31:37,437 --> 00:31:40,148
but we had a hard time
because the river was too deep.

548
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,817
Where is Mommy? Where is she?

549
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,193
Where did you take her?

550
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,572
Sofia, we did not recover
anybody from the car.

551
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:50,533
It's possible that she got out
from the windshield and got swept away.

552
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,203
Then go find her.
What are you doing? Find her.

553
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:57,040
She might be in desperate need
of help right now.

554
00:31:57,832 --> 00:31:59,584
We're doing everything, Sofia,

555
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:02,003
but your Mom's car is a total wreck.

556
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,548
No…

557
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:10,303
No. No. Mommy is a fighter.

558
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,221
She can survive this.

559
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,557
She'll overcome this. She'll live.

560
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,145
Right, Dad?

561
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:22,774
We know Mommy.

562
00:32:24,192 --> 00:32:26,861
She doesn't easily give up in life.

563
00:32:28,071 --> 00:32:31,032
She survived Auntie Aurora
and she'll definitely overcome this.

564
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,117
She will survive this.

565
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,957
Sergeant Royales, please find her.

566
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,792
- Sofia…
- Mommy.

567
00:32:42,585 --> 00:32:43,920
- No.
- Sofia…

568
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,343
Mommy…

569
00:32:53,262 --> 00:32:56,516
Yes, Sarge. I've secured
everything we need

570
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,935
from Ms. Vivian's room.

571
00:32:59,018 --> 00:32:59,852
Okay, Sarge.

572
00:33:01,729 --> 00:33:03,982
Okay.

573
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,401
I'll just send it there.

574
00:33:07,694 --> 00:33:08,820
I'll update you.

575
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:15,827
These are the things we recovered

576
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:17,537
from Ms. Trano's room.

577
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:19,580
We're investigating
if she has a possible link

578
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,582
with the killing of Attorney Morales.

579
00:33:22,625 --> 00:33:25,628
Do you think Vivian has something to do

580
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,880
with the Palacios killers?

581
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:29,632
Could she be the mastermind that Iñigo

582
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,552
was talking about, who killed my husband?

583
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,513
We're studying all the angles.

584
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:38,975
Excuse me.

585
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:39,976
Go ahead.

586
00:33:53,948 --> 00:33:56,367
It's all my fault, Dad.

587
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,454
I betrayed Mommy.

588
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:01,539
I got her in danger.

589
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,042
It's all my fault that she's gone now.

590
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:05,501
No, Sofia.

591
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,129
You're innocent.

592
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:11,466
Let's just accept the truth.

593
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,593
Accept it?

594
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,387
It may be easy for you, Dad.

595
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,473
But it's not for me.

596
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,976
I want Mommy to live.

597
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:25,146
I want to see her.

598
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,273
I don't even mind if she's in jail

599
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,276
as long as I can see and talk to her.

600
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,571
Your mother's greed has consumed her.

601
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,450
She was never content with what she had.

602
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,620
Maybe if you had loved Mom,

603
00:34:41,621 --> 00:34:43,372
she probably wouldn't have done things

604
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,625
to make sure that I have enough.

605
00:34:48,461 --> 00:34:50,671
You made her greedy, Dad.

606
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:52,673
You and your family.

607
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:57,095
You killed Mommy.

608
00:34:57,178 --> 00:34:59,305
You drove her to death.

609
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:05,645
Sis…

610
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,357
What are you feeling
about what happened to Vivian?

611
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,692
Are you happy? Relieved?

612
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,198
I don't know yet…

613
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,204
Although Francis' death
has been given closure.

614
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,000
Well…

615
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,462
It is still comforting somehow

616
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,215
that Francis was given justice.

617
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,634
Unlike Basil.

618
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,720
Which is still unclear to this day.

619
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:41,389
They still haven't found his killer.

620
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,975
That's why it still hurts, even now.

621
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:46,853
I understand how you feel.

622
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,773
I feel the same way about Dad.

623
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:56,904
Day and night, it fills my mind…

624
00:35:57,655 --> 00:36:00,825
that I hope someday
he'll be given justice.

625
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:05,413
So, Auntie Aurora is still your suspect?

626
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:07,331
Sis…

627
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:09,792
With Francis, yes, I made a mistake.

628
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:14,380
But with Dad, I'm sure…

629
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:17,425
I'm sure that he didn't kill himself.

630
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,010
I'm sure…

631
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,180
they only made it look like he overdosed

632
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:24,974
to cover up how they murdered him.

633
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,437
Mom Aurora is behind all of this.

634
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,439
She is the mastermind.

635
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,318
That's why I won't stop.

636
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,405
I won't stop until I put her behind bars.

637
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,326
Sis, the baby might get involved.

638
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,914
If you want, continue that

639
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,498
after you give birth.

640
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,335
I can't stop, George…

641
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:54,670
For Dad…

642
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,672
and for Francis,

643
00:36:59,175 --> 00:37:00,885
and for all those who died.

644
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:07,225
Sofia…

645
00:37:07,808 --> 00:37:10,686
Sofia, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Sofia.

646
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,523
Dad, if you're sorry, then go find Mom.

647
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:16,734
Bring her back to me.

648
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:23,032
Otherwise, you can go and rot in hell.

649
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,871
Now I know why your loved ones die

650
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,040
one after another.

651
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:35,878
Basil, and two of
your grandchildren with him.

652
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,882
It's because you don't deserve
any of them.

653
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:43,594
You don't deserve any of us.

654
00:37:55,481 --> 00:37:57,108
Okay, why don't we do this?

655
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,569
If I can't stop you,

656
00:38:01,195 --> 00:38:03,406
then I'll go with you.

657
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:06,575
George, no.

658
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:09,370
Look what happened to you.
No, George. I won't allow it.

659
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:11,664
Don't obligate yourself.

660
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,708
What I'm doing is too dangerous.

661
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:15,835
I don't want you to be involved again.

662
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:18,045
Exactly.

663
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,588
What you're doing is dangerous

664
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,799
that's why I will obligate myself.

665
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:27,221
With me around, we can make sure
that the baby is always safe.

666
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:32,184
That's how much you love our baby?

667
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:02,757
Galvan.

668
00:39:04,592 --> 00:39:05,509
Barbara…

669
00:39:09,305 --> 00:39:12,141
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were here.

670
00:39:13,059 --> 00:39:16,228
I just came here to say my condolences.

671
00:39:16,729 --> 00:39:18,439
I'm so sorry for your loss.

672
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:31,952
Sofia…

673
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,249
Hey, Sofia. Wait.

674
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,043
Sofia…

675
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:42,755
Why are you avoiding me?

676
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:47,843
Because I'm scared
that you'll get mad at me.

677
00:39:49,428 --> 00:39:50,971
Why would I get mad at you?

678
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:53,974
Ward, we already know what Mom did to you.

679
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:56,519
We already know
that it was her who framed you.

680
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,522
I'm ashamed.

681
00:40:00,189 --> 00:40:01,899
I'm guilty, Ward.

682
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:04,068
Sofia…

683
00:40:05,361 --> 00:40:07,780
It wasn't you who framed me,

684
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,785
so you shouldn't feel guilty, okay?

685
00:40:15,454 --> 00:40:16,997
I'm sorry, Ward.

686
00:40:17,665 --> 00:40:19,333
I'm sorry about what Mom did.

687
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:20,793
I'm sorry.

688
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:22,962
That's enough.

689
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:30,177
I know how it feels
to lose someone you loved…

690
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,263
twice.

691
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,808
Also in the most tragic way.

692
00:40:37,351 --> 00:40:40,354
When Enrico had an accident…

693
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:43,482
allegedly because of another woman,

694
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:45,443
I was so devastated.

695
00:40:47,903 --> 00:40:49,238
And then…

696
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:53,159
when my son, Jed, got shot.

697
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:55,327
William, no.

698
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,912
- Jed!
- Jed! Jed!

699
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:58,330
- Jed!
- Jed!

700
00:40:58,414 --> 00:40:59,665
Jed…

701
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,626
Jed, don't do this to me.

702
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:04,920
Don't leave me, okay?

703
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,590
Mom, don't cry. Please.

704
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:11,635
I'll stop crying. I'm not crying.

705
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:14,221
Barbara…

706
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:16,599
Have a seat first.

707
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:18,225
Come on.

708
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:22,688
I'm sorry.

709
00:41:24,023 --> 00:41:25,691
I'm sorry, I thought…

710
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,486
I had fully recovered

711
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:31,780
but every time I remember them…

712
00:41:33,365 --> 00:41:34,533
I'm sorry.

713
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:37,036
Do you want anything to drink?

714
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,705
- Water? Wine?
- No. I'm good.

715
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:45,586
Maybe it's better
if we don't talk about my pains.

716
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:48,964
Like I said, I came here
to share in your grief.

717
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:57,515
Actually, Vivian and I have been
separated for a long time.

718
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:01,101
I'm sad, yes.

719
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:05,314
But I'm more bothered…

720
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,191
because of my daughter.

721
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:11,028
Now I know why your loved ones die

722
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:13,447
one after another.

723
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:18,118
Basil and two of your grandchildren
with him.

724
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,289
It's because you don't deserve
any of them.

725
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:26,126
You don't deserve any of us.

726
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,092
There's something you need to know.

727
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,343
We're sisters.

728
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,762
Once I get Sam's baby,

729
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,681
<i>you and Ward must leave this place.</i>

730
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,433
<i>You took my children away</i>
<i>and gave them to someone else.</i>

731
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,477
<i>You are telling this court</i>

732
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:46,522
that you had twins five years ago.

733
00:42:46,605 --> 00:42:49,400
Yes. Auntie Aurora kept it
a secret from you.

734
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,736
Is that why you're suing her
for kidnapping now?

735
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:55,072
You are being accused of kidnapping.

736
00:42:55,155 --> 00:42:57,866
And the two children you kidnapped

737
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,285
are now with me and Barbara.

738
00:42:59,368 --> 00:43:00,578
I already know the truth

739
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:04,373
- I know that I'm your daughter.
- Please, let me explain, my child.

740
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,666
Don't call me your child.

741
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:08,419
I can never accept that you are my mother.

742
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,670
