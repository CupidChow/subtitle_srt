1
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,510
Sam, I'm here on the cliff.
Come here.

2
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:53,928
<i>Or what? You'll commit suicide?</i>

3
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:54,721
Yes!

4
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:57,015
PREVIOUSLY

5
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,526
<i>To an extravagant year</i>

6
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:11,321
and a fabulous future ahead of us.

7
00:01:11,404 --> 00:01:13,740
Happy birthday to me.

8
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:16,367
- Cheers!
- Happy birthday!

9
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,164
Basil!

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,415
- Basil!
- Oh my God.

11
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,750
- Hey! What's wrong with you?
- Basil!

12
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:25,168
Basil?

13
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,086
Who are you? Don't come near me.

14
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,713
Help! Help!

15
00:01:29,756 --> 00:01:30,632
What's wrong?

16
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,385
<i>Look for the person who did this to her!</i>

17
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,346
<i>Beverly was killed?</i>

18
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,765
But why is Papa accusing me?

19
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,308
George, they found your bracelet

20
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:42,977
on the path the killer took
when they escaped.

21
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,230
I just received an email
from Dr. Dionela.

22
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,648
The DNA test result?

23
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,525
It's a negative. Peter is not a Palacios.

24
00:01:48,608 --> 00:01:50,693
I already told you that, right?

25
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,820
You were just being stubborn!

26
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,614
Once they catch Peter, I'll make him pay!

27
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,032
<i>You?</i>

28
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,158
<i>Peter?</i>

29
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,368
Peter!

30
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,203
This is Jerico's room.

31
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>Ever since Peter died,</i>
<i>he's been the only one using this.</i>

32
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:03,915
<i>Sergeant Royales, look!</i>

33
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:05,375
Didn't you say

34
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,294
that the possible murder weapon
used to kill Peter

35
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:10,004
was either a pipe or a baseball bat?

36
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:11,798
<i>Can I also check the cabinet?</i>

37
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,800
<i>Yes, of course, Sergeant Royales.</i>

38
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:15,593
Jerico is the killer?

39
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:19,222
<i>They saw a picture of Sir Basil</i>
<i>in Jerico's cabinet.</i>

40
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,808
They also saw a picture of Sir Paco
marked with an X.

41
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,019
You're a bunch of animals!

42
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:26,813
That guy is a killer!

43
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:30,024
But I won't let him hurt another Palacios.

44
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,193
You're so, so bad!

45
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:34,028
I'm sorry

46
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,614
for only visiting you just now.

47
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:39,951
It's all right, Ma.

48
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:43,204
You came right on time.

49
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,260
Sir Galvan is offering a reward
of five million

50
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:00,555
to whoever can discover where Jerico is.

51
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,808
Call Galvan.

52
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:06,060
Tell him we'll eat together.

53
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,397
He's getting ready, madam.

54
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,568
There's a meeting
for the security team now.

55
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,529
Where's Rebecca?

56
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,741
She ate in her room.

57
00:03:20,783 --> 00:03:22,076
What about Sam?

58
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,038
She's also in her room with Mercy.

59
00:03:26,497 --> 00:03:27,498
They're…

60
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,460
packing their things.

61
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,463
So,

62
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:36,216
I'll eat alone?

63
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,343
I can accompany you, madam.

64
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,931
I'll just move the security briefing
to later in the afternoon.

65
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:44,766
No need, Amando.

66
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:46,351
Prioritize that.

67
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:49,395
Our security is more important.

68
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,397
I'll be fine here.

69
00:03:52,523 --> 00:03:55,235
In fact, I prefer to eat alone.

70
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:59,530
Less stressful, more peaceful.

71
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:00,782
Thank you.

72
00:04:00,865 --> 00:04:02,742
Just bring my food here.

73
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,328
Excuse me, madam.

74
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,717
I know someone who will enjoy
eating with me.

75
00:04:22,428 --> 00:04:23,513
Here.

76
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:27,809
Here's our protection just in case
Jerico comes back.

77
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:28,935
See!

78
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,777
Mother, I'll get an extra one.
I'll give it to Sofia.

79
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:39,529
Oh, come on!

80
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,738
Don't worry about Sofia.

81
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:42,865
Just let Vivian's daughter be.

82
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:44,867
Let them take care of their own lives!

83
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:46,703
Mother, don't say that about Sofia.

84
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,163
She's nice and caring.

85
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,665
What? Hold on.

86
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,792
Why are you being like this?
Do you like that girl?

87
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:55,878
So what if I do?

88
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:56,963
Mother, she's a Palacios.

89
00:04:57,046 --> 00:05:01,175
Remember how excited you were
when George was about to marry Basil?

90
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,219
Hey, why drag me into this?

91
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,512
It's Mother's fault.

92
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:05,471
What's with you?

93
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:09,225
How many times do I have to tell you
not to call me "Mother"?

94
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,519
Call me "Mama."

95
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,354
All right, Mama.

96
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:15,106
- Happy?
- Happy.

97
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:39,589
<i>The attorney has filed a motion</i>
<i>to dismiss Francis' case.</i>

98
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,010
<i>It's just a matter of time</i>
<i>before I can be with my brother.</i>

99
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:46,888
<i>After that,</i>

100
00:05:47,805 --> 00:05:50,016
<i>we will be leaving this house.</i>

101
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,435
<i>Don't worry.</i>

102
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,396
<i>Once Jerico is arrested,</i>

103
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,858
<i>justice will be done</i>
<i>for the people who were killed here.</i>

104
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,700
<i>What happened to you</i>
<i>was an accident, Paco.</i>

105
00:06:09,327 --> 00:06:11,079
<i>I didn't want you to die.</i>

106
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,457
<i>But I had no choice.</i>

107
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,585
<i>You didn't want to set me free.</i>

108
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,798
<i>You wanted me to be with you</i>
<i>even in death.</i>

109
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:26,177
<i>I know Jerico</i>
<i>shouldn't take the fall for your death</i>

110
00:06:27,804 --> 00:06:29,931
<i>because he didn't kill you.</i>

111
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:34,310
<i>You brought death upon yourself.</i>

112
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,647
You know, Sofia
is an illegitimate Palacios.

113
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:21,858
And that Vivian! I don't like her at all.

114
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,317
That woman is like a rusty nail!

115
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:26,279
Mother, Sofia isn't like that.
She's flawless.

116
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:28,364
Ward, can you please not answer back?

117
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,866
It's so noisy!

118
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,285
Ma'am?

119
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:35,830
Inigo!

120
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,124
Attorney.

121
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,544
It seems you're visiting us
more often these days.

122
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,671
Not really.

123
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:47,216
I dropped by the police station earlier
to check on Jerico and Basil's case.

124
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:49,969
Since I'm George's lawyer,

125
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,723
they let me give this to her.

126
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,438
Are you saying goodbye to my son?

127
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:12,325
Ma, I want to thank you…

128
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:17,413
for welcoming us into your home.

129
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,668
I will never forget all the memories.

130
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,254
The good…

131
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,591
and the bad.

132
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,387
Is this really my destiny, Sam?

133
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,474
To be alone.

134
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:43,064
Basil's wedding ring.

135
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,693
They recovered that
from near where Peter was.

136
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,405
There were no other fingerprints
but Peter's.

137
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:54,742
It's not vital in the investigation,
so they returned it to you.

138
00:08:56,494 --> 00:08:57,662
Thank you.

139
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:58,663
You're welcome.

140
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,289
Okay, I'll go ahead.

141
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,083
I still have my hearing to attend to.

142
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,334
- Okay.
- I'll see you.

143
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:04,961
- Okay.
- All right.

144
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:10,132
Too bad.

145
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,592
Abdul is no longer around.

146
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,804
We would have stronger ties
with the police,

147
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,472
but…

148
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,640
it seems someone replaced him.

149
00:09:17,723 --> 00:09:20,101
Right, George? With that attorney?

150
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,478
Mother, Inigo and I are just friends.

151
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,856
Yeah right, that's what you told me before
about Abdul.

152
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,733
That you were just friends.

153
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,235
Oh, come on!

154
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:31,654
Hey, wait a second.

155
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,782
You too, don't call me "Mother."

156
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,783
Mama!

157
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:36,951
Call me Mama.

158
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,329
It doesn't suit this place,
especially with such a beautiful bridge!

159
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,752
When Paco's dad got me pregnant,

160
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,422
I was so happy.

161
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:52,800
And yet that bastard…

162
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,761
left me for another woman.

163
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,348
But I was okay.

164
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,435
I still have my son.

165
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,938
I built my life around him.

166
00:10:06,939 --> 00:10:10,234
It didn't matter
that I was a single mother.

167
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,863
At least…

168
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,323
I am a mother.

169
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,911
But Paco left me too.

170
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,375
All he left me…

171
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:30,129
was that child, Sam.

172
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:32,423
Your child.

173
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,601
You will still see your grandchild,

174
00:10:45,269 --> 00:10:47,355
but on my terms.

175
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:56,447
Everyone hates me in this house, Sam.

176
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,284
Galvan.

177
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:04,372
Rebecca.

178
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:07,124
The staff.

179
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:12,046
I don't want to be alone, Sam.

180
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:20,930
I want to be a better person
for my grandchild.

181
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,767
Yes, I admit, that I was not
a perfect mother.

182
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:30,272
I'm not even a good mother-in-law.

183
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,403
But maybe, just maybe,

184
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:40,741
I could be a good grandmother.

185
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,370
Sam, please.

186
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:46,956
Sam, please don't leave me.

187
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,751
Don't take away the chance

188
00:11:50,835 --> 00:11:53,963
for me to be a grandmother
to my grandchild, please.

189
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,424
I'm asking you…

190
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,467
No, no.

191
00:11:59,385 --> 00:12:00,553
Sam…

192
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,556
Sam. Sam.

193
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,016
I'm begging you.

194
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,229
I'm begging you. Don't leave me.

195
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,898
Please, don't take my grandchild
away from me.

196
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:14,900
I'm begging you.

197
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:17,570
Please, please, please.

198
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,873
Please, Sam.

199
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:33,252
Ma…

200
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:51,312
I can't believe it.

201
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:56,692
Finally, Basil's killer
has been identified.

202
00:12:56,775 --> 00:13:00,070
My husband's soul will be at peace.

203
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:02,781
He can finally rest in peace.

204
00:13:02,865 --> 00:13:05,493
And you can finally flirt in peace.

205
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,620
Oh, come on, Mother!

206
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:08,871
"Mother"?

207
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,457
Didn't I tell you not to call me "Mother"?

208
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,584
It's "Mama"! Mama.

209
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:15,836
The other doesn't go well
with this silver horse at all.

210
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,547
Okay, fine. Mama,
if that's the way you want it.

211
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,715
Mama.

212
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,468
You will be fine.

213
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:47,243
Hey.

214
00:13:47,785 --> 00:13:49,954
I noticed

215
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,416
the way you and Attorney Inigo
looked at each other.

216
00:13:55,876 --> 00:13:58,462
What's wrong with Inigo and I
becoming close?

217
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,965
He's a man and a lawyer.

218
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,675
He can protect me.

219
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,555
Mother, who else should
we expect to protect us?

220
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,598
Papa?

221
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:13,435
He is too busy looking for Jerico.

222
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,646
We don't have any allies in this house.

223
00:14:41,171 --> 00:14:45,426
We have achieved our dream
of living in a big and beautiful house.

224
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,635
But what kind of house?

225
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,387
One where there's a killer.

226
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,472
And they haven't found him yet.

227
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:55,519
Every move you make, you don't know
if you're safe or if you'll be next.

228
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:03,402
What's with you?

229
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:04,737
Don't talk that way.

230
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,322
You're thinking so negatively.

231
00:15:07,072 --> 00:15:10,409
I'm just telling the truth, Mother…

232
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:11,744
Ma.

233
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,956
It's true, the phrase,
"Be careful what you wish for."

234
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,667
You never know what your wish
will be attached to.

235
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,420
All right.

236
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:23,422
I'm scared now.

237
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:27,259
Don't worry, I won't object to
you flirting with the attorney.

238
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,512
But be careful, George.

239
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:33,474
You still don't know him that well.

240
00:15:36,310 --> 00:15:38,562
Ma'am, sir, you are not allowed to go out.

241
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,939
There's a killer on the loose.

242
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:42,316
If you want, you can ask for permission
from Sir Galvan.

243
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,944
Daddy doesn't care about me.

244
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,739
All he cares about is Basil
and finding Jerico.

245
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,282
So please, let us out!

246
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:52,993
Sofia, why don't we just go back?

247
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,330
Wait.

248
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:57,498
Call Mommy.

249
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:00,751
For sure, she'll let me go out.

250
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:01,877
Go ahead!

251
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,046
Okay, ma'am.

252
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,302
PALACIOS KILLER?
FIVE MILLION REWARD FOR CAPTURE

253
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:15,975
Killer, huh?

254
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:18,686
Hello?

255
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,145
Louie, let's go.

256
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,276
Hey, come back here!

257
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:30,114
Ma'am Sofia! Ma'am Sofia!

258
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,052
- Cheers, Mother!
- Yes.

259
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,056
Ruth!

260
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,891
Where is your son? Where is Ward?

261
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,811
You know, you're like soy sauce. You like
dipping into other people's business.

262
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,771
George and I are still talking.

263
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:06,442
I just want to know where my daughter is.

264
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,945
I've been calling her and looking for her,
but I can't contact her.

265
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,115
Maybe your son knows where he is.

266
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,492
Ward is just in his room.

267
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,410
What?

268
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:18,912
So where is my daughter?

269
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,665
It's your daughter's own fault.

270
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:26,045
She goes around everywhere even though
there's a killer roaming about.

271
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,130
Oh my!

272
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,424
She might die next.

273
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:32,426
She might hang herself,

274
00:17:32,509 --> 00:17:33,844
or be poisoned,

275
00:17:33,927 --> 00:17:35,846
or be stabbed!

276
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:36,638
Or--

277
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:38,098
You're so annoying!

278
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,392
You're really worthless! You're so evil!

279
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,020
Sofia! Sofia!

280
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:44,563
Sofia!

281
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:46,148
- Mother, don't scare others.
- Sofia!

282
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,734
See? Serves her right.

283
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,203
It's a little late.

284
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:02,247
They might be looking for us already.

285
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,042
Just five more minutes, please.

286
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,796
It's creepy here.

287
00:18:14,718 --> 00:18:18,430
We've checked the whole estate,
but Sofia hasn't come back yet.

288
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:21,475
Where did they go?

289
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:23,227
It's your fault, Vivian.

290
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,856
Your job of looking after Sofia is
so easy, and yet you can't do it!

291
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,652
Why are you blaming me?

292
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,405
Aren't we both Sofia's parents?

293
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:38,283
That means we both have an obligation
to look after her, not just me.

294
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,868
I am busy.

295
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:41,703
And you even added to my problems!

296
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,456
Is that so?

297
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,376
You see Sofia as a problem?

298
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,129
Can you just argue later?

299
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,174
Our priority right now is to find Sofia.

300
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,052
I already texted Sergeant Royales.

301
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,595
He is on his way here.

302
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,806
George, I'll help with the search.

303
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:03,016
Hey, no. You stay here.
You're not leaving.

304
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,394
You might get in danger.
Come on, Ward.

305
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,813
Listen to Mother, Ward.

306
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,942
This place is perfect.

307
00:19:13,569 --> 00:19:15,612
I will bury my dream here.

308
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,616
The dream of being loved
and accepted by my own family.

309
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,037
At least you,

310
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:28,375
even if you're not the real son
of your mother, Margaret,

311
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:31,378
she treats you like her own child.

312
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,714
- While me…
- Maybe you're looking

313
00:19:33,797 --> 00:19:35,465
for love in the wrong place.

314
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,054
A lot of people love you, Sofia.

315
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,057
You just have to open your eyes.

316
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,060
My eyes are open.

317
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,646
Close it.

318
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:59,072
And now, open it.

319
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,325
Louie!

320
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,078
Don't be scared.

321
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:49,164
I won't hurt you.
I just want to talk to Sofia.

322
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,874
- Don't come near us.
- Sofia.

323
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,960
Don't come near us.

324
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,087
- Sofia, I just want to talk to you.
- Don't come near us!

325
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,885
Please don't kill me!

326
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:03,512
Relax. I won't hurt you.

327
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,306
- Stay away!
- Sofia, I just want to talk to you.

328
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,308
- Stay away from me!
- I won't hurt you.

329
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,393
Please don't hurt me!

330
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,062
- Please.
- Sofia, calm down.

331
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,983
- Stay away!
- I just want to talk to you.

332
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:19,945
- Louie, help me!
- Sofia…

333
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,163
It's not your dad, Louie.

334
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,374
It's Diana.

335
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:51,018
Nobody gets to hurt the people I love!

336
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:53,312
Louie, that's enough. Please stop it.

337
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:55,647
Please, that's enough.

338
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:56,940
Louie.

339
00:21:58,942 --> 00:22:00,402
Come on, please.

340
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,622
Jeff doesn't know where they are.

341
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,001
Sofia is with Louie.

342
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:19,087
Mommy!

343
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:20,964
- Sofia!
- They're here.

344
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,799
- Mommy!
- That's good.

345
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,053
What's with you? Where have you been?

346
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:27,471
Where did you go?

347
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,891
Didn't I tell you not to go anywhere?

348
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:33,018
It's Jerico. We saw him.

349
00:22:36,271 --> 00:22:37,147
What's this?

350
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,149
Why do you have a wound, huh?

351
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:40,984
What did that Jerico do to you?

352
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,071
That guy isn't allowed to hurt you!
I will kill that jerk!

353
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,906
Ma, it's fine. It's just a scratch.

354
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,699
I was with Louie.

355
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:49,409
He saved me.

356
00:22:49,493 --> 00:22:52,370
Vivian, scold your daughter.

357
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,916
It's dangerous outside,
and yet she was roaming around.

358
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,627
It's Louie's fault.
He's such an attention-seeker.

359
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:01,213
Don't drag Sofia anywhere else!

360
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,423
And you, young man.

361
00:23:03,507 --> 00:23:05,467
You put my daughter in danger!

362
00:23:06,468 --> 00:23:07,886
Wow, Dad!

363
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:11,264
Thank you. I really feel
your concern right now.

364
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,934
I am concerned about you!

365
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,186
That's why I'm getting mad!

366
00:23:16,812 --> 00:23:19,773
Did you ever even ask how I was doing?

367
00:23:19,856 --> 00:23:23,110
Did you ever even ask if I got hurt?

368
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,695
Well, it's pointless.

369
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:30,242
It's pointless hoping that I will get
the love I deserve.

370
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:34,329
Sofia…

371
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,499
Look what you did.

372
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,462
Hello?

373
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,588
Jerico?

374
00:23:44,965 --> 00:23:45,841
What now?

375
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:48,593
<i>How are you?</i>

376
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:50,637
Jerico, is it true?

377
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,639
That you attacked Sofia?

378
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,849
<i>I didn't attack her.</i>

379
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:57,894
I just approached her
and she suddenly panicked.

380
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,231
I just wanted to explain things to her.

381
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:03,316
Why to her?

382
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,695
I thought she'd understand me because
we're both illegitimate children.

383
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,738
But she's like the rest of her family.

384
00:24:09,447 --> 00:24:10,532
<i>Judgmental.</i>

385
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,493
The thing is, Jerico…

386
00:24:13,577 --> 00:24:15,704
<i>Do you also believe that I'm a bad person?</i>

387
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:18,081
Rebecca, I'm innocent.

388
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:21,585
I'm not the one
killing the Palacios family.

389
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,336
There's someone else killing them.

390
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,421
Who?

391
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:25,672
<i>I don't know!</i>

392
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,716
All I know is that you're not safe.

393
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:30,760
<i>As long as someone is killing</i>
<i>at the Palacios' Estate,</i>

394
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:32,179
<i>your life is in danger,</i>

395
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:34,306
and I won't let anything bad
happen to you, Rebecca.

396
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:35,515
Jerico…

397
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,601
Jerico, just calm down, okay?

398
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,603
Just wait.

399
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,521
Uncle!

400
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:42,439
I will kill you.

401
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,358
<i>I will kill you, Jerico!</i>

402
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,905
The moment you come anywhere near
any member of the Palacios family,

403
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:53,408
you will regret the day you were born!

404
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,915
Don't you ever talk to that man again!

405
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,958
- But Uncle…
- No buts!

406
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,544
He is a killer.

407
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,004
He killed Basil.

408
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,174
Stop defending him!

409
00:25:09,257 --> 00:25:10,592
Do you understand?

410
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,611
Yes! Finally, I'm free.

411
00:25:29,694 --> 00:25:30,987
Yeah!

412
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,116
Thank you so much, Sam. Thank you.

413
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,246
Thank you.

414
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:40,914
Attorney, thank you.

415
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,416
Thank you.

416
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,626
No need to thank me.

417
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,836
I was just doing my job.

418
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,132
You should thank Madam Aurora Palacios.

419
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:55,053
She's the one who pressured me
to expedite your release.

420
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,767
What am I going to do with Sam?

421
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,561
She still won't budge.

422
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,985
I played nice,
but she still refused, Paco.

423
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,238
I even begged for her to stay.

424
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,531
No,

425
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,117
you did not.

426
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,452
You don't beg.

427
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,790
Yes.

428
00:26:23,873 --> 00:26:26,710
Imagine. Me, begging?

429
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:29,546
But no,

430
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:30,880
she didn't buy it.

431
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,385
Did she also tell you, Attorney,
to give the credit to her

432
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:37,679
for the release of my brother from prison?

433
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,601
Regardless of whether
she helped us or not,

434
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:45,562
my brother would have gotten out of prison

435
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,398
because Francis is innocent,

436
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:51,318
and there's strong evidence
against Jerico.

437
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,653
In Aurora's defense, Sam,

438
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,490
she only wanted to help you
and your family.

439
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,492
That's it.

440
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:02,287
Attorney, you don't need to defend her.

441
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,040
She's not on trial here.

442
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,585
And I've made my decision.

443
00:27:11,629 --> 00:27:13,298
We're leaving this house.

444
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:17,927
I was only waiting for my brother
to be released from prison.

445
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:24,684
She's a tough woman and you know that.

446
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,977
She's full of pride.

447
00:27:26,686 --> 00:27:30,565
We got married
without your permission, remember?

448
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:32,567
I remember.

449
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:37,364
No matter how I tried to erase that
from my memory,

450
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,782
I couldn't do it, Paco.

451
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,702
Because that was the time
you disobeyed me again.

452
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,537
Sam is stubborn,

453
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,790
just like you.

454
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:52,629
Is that the reason
why you chose her to be your wife?

455
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,429
- Francis, my son!
- Mother!

456
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,818
- Can I kiss you?
- Mother! Mother!

457
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:17,987
Mother! Mother,
I'm dirty and smelly.

458
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,657
I'm dirty and smelly.

459
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,461
- Did you miss me, Mother?
- I missed you so much!

460
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,714
Let me look at my son.
Let me see you.

461
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:38,800
Let me look at my son.

462
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:44,931
Mother, Sam, thank you.
Thank you so much.

463
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:47,058
Thank you.

464
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,643
I love you so much.

465
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:49,728
Love you.

466
00:28:50,311 --> 00:28:51,521
I love you too.

467
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,897
- I love you, son.
- Mother.

468
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:54,607
So

469
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:57,861
when do we tell Sam…

470
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,322
that I'm here?

471
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,119
Paco, my son.

472
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:10,123
If you are going to leave me,

473
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:15,545
then it's better if I go with you.

474
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,341
Paco?

475
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,051
Paco?

476
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,554
Paco, you're alive?

477
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,681
Nurse! Nurse!

478
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,433
My son is alive!

479
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:32,103
Paco, wake up. Wake up, son.

480
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:35,440
Wake up. Wake up, son!

481
00:29:35,523 --> 00:29:37,609
Wake up.

482
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,820
Son, just live
and I will do anything for you.

483
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,655
I will give you everything, son.

484
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,116
Please, please, please, please.

485
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:55,251
Please, son, wake up!

486
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:01,382
Help me.

487
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,514
Paco, my son…

488
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,266
Son, you're alive.

489
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:12,602
Say…

490
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,812
say nothing, please.

491
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,146
Say nothing.

492
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,274
I'll take care of everything.

493
00:30:18,858 --> 00:30:21,903
I will take care of everything.

494
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,155
Starting today, no one…

495
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:27,492
as in no one,

496
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:30,370
will ever harm you again, son.

497
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,996
No one.

498
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:33,915
Do you hear me?

499
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,798
I told you, Paco.

500
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,385
No one will know that you're here.

501
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:48,721
Not even your wife.

502
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,445
Ward, where is Sofia?

503
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:07,490
I'll give these to her. You can go home.

504
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,286
What's your problem, bro?

505
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:13,538
You're shameless, aren't you?

506
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:18,626
After you put Sofia in danger,
you'll come here as if nothing happened?

507
00:31:26,092 --> 00:31:27,302
May I come in?

508
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:37,604
I brought you these.

509
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,986
You didn't eat breakfast earlier.

510
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,490
I might get scolded if I leave my room.

511
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,914
Sofia, my child,

512
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,917
don't be upset because of Daddy.

513
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,966
Rebecca?

514
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:16,225
Is it true that Sam's brother has returned
to Aurora's house?

515
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:22,565
It's so nice!

516
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,568
They're all together and free.

517
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:30,073
Meanwhile, your brother

518
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,532
is still wanted.

519
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,327
Wait, bro. It wasn't his fault.

520
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,496
It was even Louie who saved Sofia.

521
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:39,290
He's the reason why Sofia was in danger.

522
00:32:40,041 --> 00:32:42,627
If he hadn't brought Sofia
to the cemetery,

523
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,087
Sofia wouldn't have been in danger.

524
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,798
Okay, fine, it was my fault.

525
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:48,633
Now, let me apologize to her.

526
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,510
No need.

527
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,888
You can't go near her.

528
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,683
You're no longer allowed here.
That's what Uncle Galvan said.

529
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,601
So…

530
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,062
you can leave now.

531
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,531
You know,

532
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:16,536
it is my duty
to protect everyone in this family.

533
00:33:18,621 --> 00:33:22,208
I already lost your brother Basil
and his child.

534
00:33:24,085 --> 00:33:28,006
I will not lose another Palacios.

535
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,591
Jerico is innocent.

536
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,094
Someone framed him.

537
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,263
I think so too.

538
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,766
If you think about it,

539
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:43,730
the manner of killing was
so sophisticated, right?

540
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,023
There was…

541
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,900
What was it? Morphine poisoning?

542
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:52,530
And then there was the secret tunnel.

543
00:33:52,613 --> 00:33:56,576
I don't think Jerico's smart enough
to do all that. Right?

544
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,538
I never wanted to live in this house.

545
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:05,626
I was happy in our old house.

546
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,340
All I wanted

547
00:34:11,424 --> 00:34:14,719
was a complete and normal family…

548
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:21,142
where I am not embarrassed to say
that I am Sofia Palacios,

549
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,979
the daughter of Galvan Palacios.

550
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,858
What?

551
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:29,817
You're overreacting.

552
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:31,944
Bro.

553
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,696
- Please.
- Leave.

554
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,948
Louie, let's go.

555
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,784
Louie…

556
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:38,910
Louie. Louie.

557
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:40,411
Louie.

558
00:34:42,538 --> 00:34:44,123
Come on, bring it on.

559
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:46,667
You're so obnoxious!

560
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:49,921
Come on! All you do is push.
Go ahead and punch me!

561
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,422
- What's with you?
- It's you who should punch me.

562
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:53,049
- Punch me!
- What's wrong with you?

563
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,092
Fight!

564
00:34:54,175 --> 00:34:55,843
Louie, don't fight with him. Let's go.

565
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,053
We're leaving.

566
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,846
We're leaving!

567
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,014
Let's go! Let's go!

568
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,224
Let's go!

569
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,735
That's a plan for your debut.

570
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:16,906
You'll be turning 18 soon.

571
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,992
On your birthday,

572
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,745
I will introduce you to the public…

573
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,375
as my daughter

574
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:31,003
and the next heir of the Palacios family.

575
00:35:35,925 --> 00:35:37,468
Thank you, Daddy.

576
00:35:50,231 --> 00:35:52,692
Are you insulting my brother?

577
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,695
No, I'm not insulting him.

578
00:35:56,404 --> 00:36:00,616
On the contrary, I'm on your side.

579
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,578
You know, the truth is,

580
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:08,291
I believe that your brother
was just framed.

581
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,169
By who?

582
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:17,550
Well, who benefits now that
your brother is wanted?

583
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,928
Right? If you think about it,

584
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:28,352
who is happy right now because
their family is all together again?

585
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,692
Mother.

586
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,197
It's done. Our luggage is all packed.

587
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,200
I'll just call your brother
to help bring it to the car.

588
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:26,827
We didn't forget anything?

589
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,499
Just the bad memories.

590
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,629
We need to leave and forget them.

591
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:41,842
I'll just say goodbye to Mama.

592
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,219
Okay.

593
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:04,782
Justice.

594
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:08,369
Vengeance.

595
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,540
That's what Jerico needs.

596
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:58,002
The truth is,

597
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:02,214
I believe that your brother
was just framed.

598
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,215
By who?

599
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:07,803
Well, who benefits now that
your brother is wanted?

600
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,980
Only death can pay for a life.

601
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:26,864
Only death can save Jerico!

602
00:39:42,254 --> 00:39:46,342
Ma'am, won't you say goodbye to Ma'am Sam?

603
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:48,344
They're leaving now.

604
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,686
I did everything possible to stop her.

605
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:21,961
Sam!

606
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,173
No, Rebecca!

607
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:28,467
NEXT EPISODE

608
00:40:28,551 --> 00:40:30,511
Be kind

609
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:32,138
but be careful.

610
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:37,726
<i>A person who betrays you once</i>
<i>will betray you again.</i>

611
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,813
You risked your life to protect Sam?

612
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:44,066
I was protecting your child, Paco.

613
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,862
I would do the same for any woman
who was carrying my grandchild.

614
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,656
George, I already spoke to the police.

615
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,909
They say that Jerico is hovering around.

616
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:57,288
You need to be careful.

617
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,041
Jerico!

618
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:03,544
I'm innocent!

619
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,838
Someone else is targeting
the Palacios family.

620
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:09,258
I promise I will help you,
but just surrender first.

621
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:25,691
What?

622
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,401
Jerico, don't.
