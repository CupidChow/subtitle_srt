1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,016
We'd better just leave together.

2
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,225
Where are you going?

3
00:00:17,308 --> 00:00:18,518
Why are you leaving?

4
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:19,811
Let's go to the library.

5
00:00:19,894 --> 00:00:21,229
- I've secured all the…
- No.

6
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:23,606
<i>We're going to the basement.</i>
<i>It's safer there.</i>

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:29,612
What? Ando's dead?

8
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:31,406
<i>Yes, George. He was stabbed.</i>

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:34,409
Even though Sir Amando denies it,
he killed Ando.

10
00:00:34,492 --> 00:00:37,203
And now, he wants us all
to go to the library,

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,621
so he can kill us there.

12
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:40,540
He's going to pay. He's an animal.

13
00:00:40,623 --> 00:00:42,375
Dad, don't. I won't let you die.

14
00:00:42,459 --> 00:00:44,919
- Jericho, let's go downstairs.
- Let's go.

15
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:48,339
<i>Amando… Why do you have a knife?</i>

16
00:00:48,423 --> 00:00:50,258
<i>I don't know about the murders here.</i>

17
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,509
Get away from him.

18
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:52,427
Get away.

19
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,015
PREVIOUSLY

20
00:00:57,098 --> 00:00:59,017
Sam, what's going on there?

21
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,935
Give me the baby.

22
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:05,231
My son. My son.

23
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,025
Did Aurora take the baby?

24
00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,651
Maybe Sam needs help.

25
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:11,279
<i>Go to the other house first.</i>
<i>Use this first.</i>

26
00:01:11,362 --> 00:01:14,866
Don't forsake your Ma'am Aurora
and our grandson alone.

27
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,159
And Samantha too.

28
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,245
Make sure nothing bad happens
to her and Aunt Mercy.

29
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,456
<i>You know what you're doing</i>
<i>is wrong, Auntie.</i>

30
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:25,919
<i>So, please put down your gun</i>
<i>and give me Sam's baby.</i>

31
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,921
<i>How about you?</i>

32
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,131
<i>Would you allow it if Sir Paco was taken</i>
<i>from you when he was still young?</i>

33
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:32,801
<i>I shouldn't have taken him from Sam.</i>

34
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,677
<i>Here, take him.</i>

35
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,806
<i>You fool.</i>

36
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:42,143
<i>No one can take Paco's son away from me.</i>

37
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:43,853
Whoever you are, I'm not afraid of you.

38
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,616
You are the Palacios killer.

39
00:02:01,746 --> 00:02:03,289
Where did the gunshots come from?

40
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,668
Sam, what's going on over there?
We heard gunshots.

41
00:02:07,335 --> 00:02:09,629
Oh, my God.
I told Sam to turn off the radio.

42
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,755
Bill…

43
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,633
Maybe the gunshots we heard
came from his gun.

44
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,636
Oh, my God. No.

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,055
That's Bill.

46
00:02:19,139 --> 00:02:21,182
The Palacios killer murdered Bill.

47
00:02:21,266 --> 00:02:22,851
Amando killed him.

48
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,530
My son… Mother.

49
00:02:36,114 --> 00:02:38,491
Where is my son? Mother.

50
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:40,618
Mother.

51
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,872
Mother. Mother.

52
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,623
Mother.

53
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:47,375
What happened to you, Mother?

54
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:49,252
Mother. My God.

55
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,214
Mother, what happened to you?
Where is my son? Where is Mom Aurora?

56
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:56,217
Aurora… I saw her.

57
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:58,011
She took the baby.

58
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,388
Where did they go?

59
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,932
I don't know.
I wasn't able to follow them.

60
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:05,310
Where are they?

61
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,523
You monster.

62
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,735
Aurora.

63
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:15,111
You're an animal.

64
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:27,040
PO3 Cruz.

65
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,043
Sergeant Royales.

66
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:34,839
Thank you for meeting with me.

67
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,385
Like I told you when I called you,

68
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,847
I'm in charge of the Palacios murder case.

69
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:48,478
I dug through the Palacioses histories,

70
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,147
and your name came up when I came across

71
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:54,317
the case of Dr. Orlando Castillo.

72
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:01,699
Five years ago,
Dr. Castillo was found dead.

73
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:04,577
You and your team were the ones
who found his body.

74
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,704
I just wanted to ask a few questions.

75
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,541
Go ahead, Sarge.

76
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,045
Why does it seem like
the investigation was rushed?

77
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:22,679
You didn't send

78
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:26,849
the drug paraphernalia found in
Dr. Castillo's apartment to the crime lab.

79
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:31,020
And then you immediately confirmed that
the cause of death was a drug overdose,

80
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:33,523
even without proper testing
from the forensic team.

81
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,025
And then you immediately closed the case.

82
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:40,947
The initial medico-legal results said

83
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,575
that Doc Orly died of a heroin overdose.

84
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:45,743
What?

85
00:04:46,995 --> 00:04:48,371
Did Dad do drugs?

86
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:50,456
No.

87
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,919
My Dad is not an addict…
and he would never kill himself.

88
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,383
Ma'am, we found a lot
of paraphernalia in his room.

89
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:15,898
Wait, sir. No. My Dad is a good person.
My Dad is a doctor.

90
00:05:15,982 --> 00:05:19,068
Ma'am, we can't say for sure.

91
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,696
Sometimes, the decent ones

92
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:24,991
are the ones who hide their stench.

93
00:05:25,074 --> 00:05:26,534
Wait, sir?

94
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:29,454
Didn't you hear me?
My Dad is a good person.

95
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:30,997
Do your job.

96
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,498
Investigate.

97
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,835
I know something is going on there…
at the mines.

98
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:38,296
Investigate. Ask the people there.

99
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:40,173
Do your job.

100
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,799
Maybe there's foul play here.

101
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,135
Mom, no. What?
Are we just going to let this happen?

102
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,596
Are we just going to accept
that Dad committed suicide?

103
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,181
We know he wouldn't do that.

104
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,683
Dad didn't commit suicide.

105
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,935
PO3 Cruz,

106
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,774
I saw a lot of irregularities
in your investigation.

107
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:03,488
Because my superior interfered
in the case.

108
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:14,248
Dad…

109
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:20,088
I'm sorry, Sofia.

110
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,507
I'm sorry, George.

111
00:06:23,424 --> 00:06:25,343
Why are you apologizing, Dad?

112
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:31,641
You all got involved
in the Palacios family's mess.

113
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:33,893
All of you.

114
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,646
Jericho, Sam…

115
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:37,688
Everyone.

116
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:43,027
This family has committed so many sins

117
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,114
against our business partners,

118
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,366
against our employees,

119
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:50,576
against the people around us.

120
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,995
And this is the price of it all.

121
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,915
We are being killed one by one.

122
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,959
And what's painful is,

123
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,419
that you too are being targeted.

124
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,798
Dad, you didn't want this.

125
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,134
No, George,

126
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:11,264
but I wish I had done something
to stop this.

127
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,017
I should've stood my ground.

128
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:18,938
Did you rig the case?

129
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:24,235
PO3 Cruz… we are law enforcement officers.

130
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,030
That's why our image is being ruined
because of people like you.

131
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:32,285
By those who are paid, bribed,
and who don't care.

132
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,455
Who is your superior?

133
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,667
And do you know
who ordered him to rig the case?

134
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,338
It's Sergeant Reynaldo.

135
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:47,842
I don't know who ordered him.

136
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:51,804
I just followed his orders

137
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:56,392
to make it look like
Dr. Castillo died of suicide

138
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:59,020
through a heroin overdose.

139
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:00,980
Because he paid you?

140
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,320
Where is Sergeant Reynaldo?

141
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:13,784
He was killed by the syndicates
he extorted money from.

142
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,414
But, if you want

143
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,750
to reopen the case…

144
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:26,130
Here are the answers to your questions.

145
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,802
Why are you doing this?

146
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,304
Why are you helping me?

147
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,891
Because

148
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:40,645
I'm already being charged
for all my foolishness.

149
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,441
I want to pay at least a little

150
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:48,319
before I die.

151
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,038
I have…

152
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,255
I have prostate cancer.

153
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,632
Stage four.

154
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:14,053
It has spread to my bones, lungs,

155
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,888
liver.

156
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:20,268
So, while I'm still alive,

157
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:26,816
I want to at least correct my mistakes.

158
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:33,030
Those files contain

159
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:37,368
all my true findings
from the investigation.

160
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:42,623
Dr. Castillo's heroin overdose
was intentional.

161
00:09:43,332 --> 00:09:45,001
He did not kill himself.

162
00:09:45,626 --> 00:09:47,795
Who overdosed him?

163
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,849
Amando Namas?

164
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,435
All the evil was rooted

165
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,562
in Dad.

166
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,773
He is cruel and greedy.

167
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,777
In his obsession to preserve
Palacios Mining,

168
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,071
he became a monster.

169
00:10:15,197 --> 00:10:17,158
And Aurora inherited that.

170
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:21,329
First commandment of Golden Palacios,

171
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,790
Thou shall not steal my gold.

172
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,210
Because the punishment is death.

173
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:34,342
Ma'am, have mercy.

174
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,676
It won't happen again.

175
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,053
It really won't happen again.

176
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:38,220
Ma'am.

177
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:45,186
Aren't you worried?

178
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:49,398
Royales might find out
what you did to the Beringuela couple.

179
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:52,068
What I did?

180
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,235
We did it.

181
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,655
Aurora, I was against it,

182
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,239
but you just forced me.

183
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,949
Calm down.

184
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:01,702
Help. Help.

185
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:03,537
Hello, Sam.

186
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,833
Did I scare you?

187
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,336
You?

188
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,546
Welcome to your new home.

189
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,216
You fool. Why did you lock me up here?

190
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,926
You're so evil. You're evil.

191
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,345
You're so evil.

192
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:34,944
You're so evil.

193
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:48,124
Dad, is that why your position
was bequeathed to Aunt Aurora?

194
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:56,215
Not only did Dad bequeath
the company to Aurora,

195
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,846
but his evil and greed
for money and power.

196
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:07,184
Instead of stopping
the evil in this family,

197
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:11,188
I supported Aurora in what she did.

198
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,816
Please stop blaming yourself.

199
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,445
But, I can't help it.

200
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,449
I also committed a huge sin.

201
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,454
I was also blinded.

202
00:12:26,537 --> 00:12:28,247
I envied Aurora.

203
00:12:28,747 --> 00:12:30,624
I also wanted what she had.

204
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:33,919
Wealth and power.

205
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:36,964
But, I was weak.

206
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,717
I wasn't as brave as she was.

207
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:43,304
So, instead of stopping her,

208
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,223
I became submissive to her.

209
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,561
I'm sorry.

210
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,813
I'm weak.

211
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,400
I'm so weak.

212
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:57,651
Dad, Dad…

213
00:13:19,006 --> 00:13:20,841
I promise you.

214
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,553
After this mess with Amando is over,

215
00:13:26,096 --> 00:13:27,431
I will do

216
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:31,143
what is right
even if I have to fight Aurora.

217
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,938
And this time,

218
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,066
I will be stronger.

219
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:49,078
Someone saw him,

220
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,539
one of their miners.

221
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,667
Tonyo.

222
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,294
There was a witness?

223
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,381
Why didn't you charge Amando Namas?

224
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:05,636
Because Tonyo died
before he could testify.

225
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,640
He died in the mine,

226
00:14:10,391 --> 00:14:13,060
buried in a collapsed tunnel.

227
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,567
I asked Namas after Tonyo died,

228
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,736
but he denied everything.

229
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,991
After that,

230
00:14:27,616 --> 00:14:32,204
Sergeant Reynaldo stopped
all our investigations.

231
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,499
But,

232
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:38,377
I strongly believe

233
00:14:39,503 --> 00:14:42,798
that everything Tonyo said

234
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,717
about Namas is true.

235
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,733
<i>The number you have dialed</i>
<i>is either unattended</i>

236
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,026

237

242
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:26,383

243
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:35,893
Sergeant Tupaz, I need help.

244
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,321
Oh, my God. My son…

245
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:52,910
Quiet, please. Please, baby.

246
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,370
Aurora!

247
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,498
Give me back my son. You're evil.

248
00:15:57,581 --> 00:16:00,000
- Give me back my son.
- Aurora.

249
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,543
My son.

250
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:05,255
Mother.

251
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:14,682
You fool. Give me back my son.

252
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:16,976
No.

253
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:20,771
- No.
- My son belongs to me.

254
00:16:20,854 --> 00:16:22,606
Paco's son belongs to me. No.

255
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,358
Give him back.

256
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,904
Son…

257
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,620
Mom, let's get out of here. Hold him.

258
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:37,538
Give me the gun.

259
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,299
Sam, please be safe. Please.

260
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:51,260
<i>George?</i>

261
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,637
Sam…

262
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:57,182
Sam, what's going on? We heard gunshots.

263
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:01,270
Have you found Aunt Mercy?
Aunt Aurora? Our baby?

264
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,189
Yes, George. We got the baby
from Mom Aurora.

265
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:05,941
We're going there.

266
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:07,484
Wait.

267
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,153
You guys stay inside.

268
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,405
Amando is outside.

269
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:13,157
He killed Bill too.

270
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:14,908
What?

271
00:17:14,992 --> 00:17:16,618
My God…

272
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,078
We were about to get out.

273
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,039
We thought Amando was inside.

274
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,124
No, Auntie Mercy. Please.

275
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:25,169
He's still outside, so stay inside.

276
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,254
Find a place to hide there.

277
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,590
Thank you for warning us.

278
00:17:30,174 --> 00:17:31,884
Sam, please be careful.

279
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,260
Keep our baby safe.

280
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,305
Mother, let's go
to the staff room. Come on.

281
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:37,848
Sam.

282
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,434
Give me Paco's child.

283
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,604
Don't come near us.

284
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:47,107
Don't come near.

285
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:54,490
Aurora, stop bothering
Sam and my grandson.

286
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:58,243
Amando might come back and kill us all.

287
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:00,746
Aurora.

288
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:02,122
Don't come any closer.

289
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:06,376
No, don't come any closer.
Don't come any closer.

290
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:11,715
Aurora, Sam. What the hell is happening?

291
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,343
Hide from Amando.

292
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,639
Amando?

293
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,474
Stay there.

294
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:21,725
Oh, my God.

295
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:25,062
Sam,

296
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:27,064
run.

297
00:18:28,565 --> 00:18:32,861
Sam, I'm not the killer. Believe me.

298
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,120
You are wet…

299
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:42,788
You…

300
00:18:43,288 --> 00:18:44,289
You killed Bill.

301
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,169
Yes, I went out
to find you and protect you.

302
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,131
But, I saw Bill fighting
with the killer for the gun.

303
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,174
That's why I came back here.

304
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:55,801
I didn't kill him.

305
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:57,010
Liar.

306
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:01,682
You're the Palacios killer.

307
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:12,693
You killed my guard, Galvan's guard,
the roaming guard, Ando.

308
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,736
And now, Bill?

309
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,948
Stay back or I'll shoot you, Amando.

310
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:22,411
Aurora, you know I can't kill anyone.

311
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,165
I'm not the Palacios killer.

312
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,501
Put down the gun. Come with me.

313
00:19:29,585 --> 00:19:30,878
I'll protect you.

314
00:19:30,961 --> 00:19:32,462
I said stay back.

315
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,926
Aurora put down the gun.
Come with me, and protect--

316
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,646
Okay, Aurora,

317
00:19:50,397 --> 00:19:51,523
if you don't want to.

318
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,817
Just come with me.

319
00:19:53,901 --> 00:19:55,694
I'll take you to a safe place

320
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:59,698
where your son won't be involved
in the Palacios killer's revenge, Sam.

321
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,743
Stop your madness, Amando.

322
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,789
Sam, listen.

323
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:10,500
I won't let anything bad happen to you,

324
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,377
especially to your child…

325
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:15,172
because you're my family.

326
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,549
Paco is my son.

327
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,426
I'm his real father.

328
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:21,970
Don't believe him, Sam.

329
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,433
Sam, what I said is true.

330
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,186
Something happened to Aurora and me.

331
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,229
Paco is my child.

332
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:32,814
That's enough. Stop it, Amando.

333
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,525
That child is my flesh and blood.

334
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,320
That's why I would never hurt him.

335
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,281
Sam…

336
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,534
Believe me.

337
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,040
Can I look at Paco's child?

338
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,917
Do you want to hold him?

339
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,797
He looks like Paco.

340
00:20:57,798 --> 00:20:58,674
Is it true?

341
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:01,551
Is it true?

342
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,761
You…

343
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:04,972
Are you Paco's father?

344
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:12,145
Dad, is it true what Amando said,

345
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,899
that he and Auntie Aurora had an affair?

346
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,151
They are not in a relationship.

347
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,657
They just said something happened to them.

348
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,911
In that case,

349
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:31,999
Amando is Paco's father

350
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:35,002
Sam's baby is his grandson.

351
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,258
This revelation is crazy.

352
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:47,222
Something happened to Amando
and Ma'am Aurora, is that right?

353
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:58,775
Is it true, Mom Aurora?

354
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,571
Is my son his grandson?

355
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,116
What, Aurora?

356
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,618
Why aren't you talking?

357
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:11,538
Tell them the truth,

358
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,540
that I'm Paco's father.

359
00:22:14,124 --> 00:22:16,418
It's all in your head, Amando.

360
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:21,214
No matter what,
Aurora Palacios would never fall

361
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,633
for a poor guy like you.

362
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,220
You really have no shame, Aurora.

363
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:29,347
Until the end,

364
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,933
all that comes out of your mouth is lies.

365
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,603
I'm not lying.

366
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:38,732
Amando, you're too delusional,
too ambitious.

367
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:41,443
You're an animal. Animal.

368
00:22:48,158 --> 00:22:50,744
Good, Aurora. It's about time.

369
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:53,455
Oh, my God… Oh, my God…

370
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:57,167
- Sis… who died?
- Oh, my God.

371
00:22:57,876 --> 00:22:59,336
Sis, are you okay?

372
00:23:00,378 --> 00:23:02,130
<i>Let that be your warning, Amando.</i>

373
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:06,510
If you still don't stop your madness,
I will really kill you.

374
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,472
You can kill me, Aurora,

375
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,101
but you can't kill the truth

376
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:16,728
that Paco is my son,

377
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,397
and I'm the grandfather of Sam's son.

378
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:23,443
And I will do everything
to save them from your madness.

379
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:24,861
That's enough.

380
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,405
That's enough, Amando.
That's enough, please.

381
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,618
You can't say anything
that will change my mind.

382
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,912
I won't go with either of you

383
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,123
because I don't trust either of you.

384
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:39,376
Go away.

385
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,837
Go away.

386
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:45,924
Go, Aurora.

387
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:51,346
Shoot that killer in the head
so that our problems will stop.

388
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,351
Do you really think
Amando is the Palacios killer?

389
00:23:57,102 --> 00:24:01,481
George, if not him, who?

390
00:24:05,318 --> 00:24:07,571
Sam, Auntie Aurora. Where are you?

391
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,281
What's the gunshot we heard?

392
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,408
Ma'am Aurora, where are you?

393
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,996
Sam, be careful.

394
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,998
Take care of my grandson.

395
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:27,215
Mother.

396
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:35,640
What was that gunshot we heard?

397
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,895
Amando came back here.
He tried to take us,

398
00:24:39,978 --> 00:24:41,521
but Aurora shot him.

399
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,065
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

400
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:46,234
Aurora let him escape.

401
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:47,319
What?

402
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:50,155
Ma'am Aurora, why did you
let Sir Amando escape?

403
00:24:50,238 --> 00:24:53,783
Auntie, all of our lives are
at stake here,

404
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:55,869
and you let him escape?

405
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,663
<i>Sam, are you okay?</i>

406
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,125
<i>We heard what Amando said.</i>

407
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:05,128
Actually…

408
00:25:06,087 --> 00:25:07,839
Dad confirmed that

409
00:25:08,423 --> 00:25:10,884
something happened to Aunt Aurora
and Amando, but…

410
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:14,054
it was a mistake on Auntie Aurora's part.

411
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:21,561
But, I think
Amando really loves Mom Aurora.

412
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:24,481
And Auntie Aurora used that fact.

413
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:30,570
She did that so she could
get everything she wanted,

414
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:34,908
so that all her plans could happen
through Amando.

415
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,660
Do you think, sis…

416
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:42,499
she used Amando's love
to make him do whatever she wanted,

417
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:46,461
to get rid of all the people
she didn't want in her life…

418
00:25:48,546 --> 00:25:49,965
like Dad?

419
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:54,552
Dad, what are you doing?

420
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:57,472
I don't want to give in to the fear
caused by that Amando anymore.

421
00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:02,852
I need to confront him
so his threats to our family can stop.

422
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,613
Don't ever touch my son.

423
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,036
Mother, let's get out of here.

424
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,579
Jericho, I'll go crazy here.

425
00:26:21,663 --> 00:26:23,039
We have to leave…

426
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,041
before Amando comes back.

427
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:27,085
Sam, that's a dangerous idea.

428
00:26:27,168 --> 00:26:30,005
It's still dark outside
and the rain hasn't stopped yet.

429
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,466
We have a gun.

430
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,637
But, we don't know where Amando is
and if he's with anyone else.

431
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,515
Jericho is right, Ma'am Sam.

432
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:43,893
It's better if we stay inside for now.
At least until he is stopped.

433
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,147
It's risky, we might get caught
in the dark.

434
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,357
Let's go to the basement.

435
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,484
No, not there. Not in the basement.

436
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:54,070
We won't be heard there.
We won't be seen there.

437
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,826
In the study…
Let's go to the study. Come on.

438
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:01,328
- This way.
- Let's go.

439
00:27:09,294 --> 00:27:12,672
And so I can get revenge
for poisoning Basil.

440
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:17,427
But, how sure are you
that Amando poisoned Basil?

441
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:20,597
Because Paco and Basil were at odds.

442
00:27:21,598 --> 00:27:26,144
That's probably why he used
to think Basil pushed Paco.

443
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:29,147
That's why he's taking revenge.
He's taking revenge on all of us.

444
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,858
He's losing his mind.

445
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,195
Look. He stabbed me.

446
00:27:36,029 --> 00:27:40,158
He's on a killing spree.
That's why we're locked up here now.

447
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,076
Dad…

448
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:46,539
I also want to make Amando pay
if he killed my husband,

449
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:50,418
but you confronting him is dangerous.

450
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:53,254
Yes, Sir Galvan. The children are right.

451
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,883
How can you be sure
that Amando acted alone

452
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:58,843
and had no accomplices?

453
00:27:58,927 --> 00:28:01,179
I don't care how many there are.

454
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:02,806
I have a gun.

455
00:28:02,889 --> 00:28:04,808
I'm ready to kill them.

456
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:09,187
The important thing is
that Amando's evil ways must stop.

457
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,731
But, Dad. Dad, please.

458
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:14,067
I'm scared.

459
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:16,486
I already lost Mommy.

460
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,079
You won't catch me alive.

461
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:30,667
We'll die first before you catch me.

462
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:35,839
Miss Trano…

463
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,173
Surrender.

464
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,983
Sir, we recovered the car earlier.

465
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:58,361
We had a hard time
because the river was too deep.

466
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,488
How about Mommy?

467
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:02,866
Where is she? Where did you take her?

468
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,785
Sofia, no body was recovered from the car.

469
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,997
She may have slipped through
the windshield and was swept away.

470
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:12,459
Then go find her.
What are you doing? Find her.

471
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,253
She might be in desperate need
of help right now.

472
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:17,714
We're doing everything we can, Sofia.

473
00:29:17,797 --> 00:29:20,216
But, your mom's car is a total wreck.

474
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,598
I don't want to lose you

475
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:30,977
just because some crazy man is
trying to massacre our family.

476
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,228
Dad…

477
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:35,315
Don't worry, Sofia.

478
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,776
You won't lose Daddy.

479
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,986
I'll be very careful.

480
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,909
Dad, just make sure, okay?

481
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,536
I don't want to lose you.

482
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,624
I promise you, Sofia.

483
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,793
I'll be careful.

484
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:57,670
Cairo…

485
00:29:58,671 --> 00:30:00,673
you take charge here.

486
00:30:01,382 --> 00:30:02,425
Keep them all safe.

487
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,989
Here. Let's stay here first.

488
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:27,325
Rico, check it out.

489
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:28,910
- Check the room.
- Mother, the baby.

490
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,620
Come in, quick.

491
00:30:34,332 --> 00:30:36,084
What happened? Why?

492
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,043
- Why?
- Son.

493
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,254
Maybe he's hungry.

494
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:43,466
Sam, is he okay?

495
00:30:45,927 --> 00:30:47,262
I'll just breastfeed him, Mother.

496
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,388
Okay.

497
00:31:11,995 --> 00:31:13,204
So, what now?

498
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,583
Are we trapping ourselves here?

499
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,167
Can't we even go out?

500
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:21,754
Isn't it dangerous?
Amando is still outside.

501
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:25,049
And how are you sure
we're safe here, Mercy?

502
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:27,552
I've locked all
the windows and doors, Ma'am.

503
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:30,346
So, we'll just wait for someone
to rescue us?

504
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:34,767
Or some… or some sort
of divine intervention, right?

505
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:38,354
You, Jericho. God, you're a soldier.

506
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,982
Can't you even protect us?

507
00:31:41,065 --> 00:31:42,817
Please, don't be noisy.

508
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,903
No. You shut up, Mercy.

509
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:49,449
This is my house.
I can do whatever I want.

510
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:53,286
You can do whatever you want,
then you go out.

511
00:31:53,369 --> 00:31:56,581
You can make noise there.
Don't bother us here.

512
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,875
Why are you so eager to go out?

513
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,596
Someone is knocking on the door.

514
00:32:15,016 --> 00:32:17,018
Cairo, open the door. Please.

515
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:18,686
Cairo, don't.

516
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,271
Why?

517
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,899
Maybe it's the Palacios killer.

518
00:32:22,982 --> 00:32:24,484
What if it's Dad?

519
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:27,403
You're worried about Amando.

520
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:30,198
You want to make sure
you didn't shoot him seriously.

521
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:35,745
Or, do you want him gone before
he reveals all about your conspiracy?

522
00:32:35,828 --> 00:32:37,747
For the nth time, Mercy,

523
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:41,960
I am not, in any way,
in cahoots with that killer.

524
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,544
I'm not his accomplice.

525
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,672
No one believes you.

526
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,507
I'm telling the truth.

527
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:51,135
I don't care if you believe me or not.

528
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,971
Please, can you just stop?

529
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,687
What if it's Sir Amando?

530
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:05,274
Mrs. George Palacios,
Sir Galvan, this is Sergeant Tupaz.

531
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:07,652
Sergeant Tupaz, he said.

532
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,654
Open the door, quick.

533
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:14,784
Yes, Sarge.

534
00:33:15,368 --> 00:33:18,079
Sir Galvan's family is here.
They seem okay.

535
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:22,166
Are you the only ones?
What about Sergeant Royales?

536
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,545
He's going to the other house.
He'll check on the people there.

537
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:28,548
George…

538
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,801
Call Sam. Tell her the police are here.

539
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,220
Okay, I'll try again.

540
00:33:35,596 --> 00:33:38,474
Sam… Sam, are you there?

541
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,062
We're safe, Sam. Sergeant Tupaz is here.

542
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:45,982
How are you doing over there?
Have you seen Sergeant Royales?

543
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,025
Sam?

544
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,778
Oh, no. Why is no one answering?

545
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,989
My God, my God…

546
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:56,242
Save us from Amando, my God.

547
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,456
When did you have the right
to shout in my house, Jericho?

548
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,877
Aunt Aurora, our lives are in danger,
and you keep on shouting.

549
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:10,256
What if Sir Amando came back
and heard your fights?

550
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:12,300
He would know where we are hiding.

551
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:14,343
Jericho is right.

552
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,555
Let's all be quiet for now.

553
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:24,187
Sam, are you there?

554
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:27,857
George, what's going on with them?

555
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:31,319
Sergeant Tupaz, what did
Sergeant Royales say?

556
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,697
Sergeant Royales.
Sergeant Royales, update?

557
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,575
<i>All guards down.</i>

558
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:40,161
<i>Just stay there and secure everyone.</i>

559
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:41,788
Ten-four.

560
00:34:42,413 --> 00:34:45,333
Daddy. We should have never let him out.

561
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,002
Cairo, can you follow Dad?

562
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:52,298
Sofia, can't you see
what happened to my neck?

563
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:55,093
Sir Amando almost slashed me.

564
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,637
You're such a coward, Cairo.

565
00:34:58,137 --> 00:35:00,598
If you don't want to, I'll go.

566
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,391
I'll come with you.

567
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,476
I'm sorry, Son.

568
00:35:47,186 --> 00:35:50,356
I didn't have the courage
to introduce myself to you.

569
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:53,151
I was a coward.

570
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,822
I was subservient to your mother's wishes.

571
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,659
I got scared

572
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,620
that she would separate us.

573
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,167
Amando,

574
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,461
what happened to us before

575
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:15,047
was just once.

576
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:19,468
It will never happen again.

577
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,429
I was drunk then.

578
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,472
I was lonely.

579
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,349
That's why it happened.

580
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,020
But, it will never happen again.

581
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:32,064
Get that into your head.

582
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:39,280
Know your place in this house, Amando.

583
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:40,948
You are just my servant.

584
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:46,329
You have no right to comment
on my personal affairs.

585
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:47,246
Now get out.

586
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,998
Amando…

587
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:54,295
Not all the people we love
will love us back.

588
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,092
I trust you with my life.

589
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:06,349
I feel safe and protected
when I'm with you.

590
00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:12,104
But, that's all.

591
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:17,068
- I loved you, Aurora.
- Yes, Amando.

592
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,905
But, you knew I could never love you.

593
00:37:22,031 --> 00:37:24,450
I'm a Palacios and you,

594
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,828
you said it yourself.

595
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,331
you're just a lowly servant.

596
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:07,285
Thank God. Thank God you're okay.

597
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:08,536
NEXT EPISODE

598
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:12,665
Sir, what are the Palacioses plans
for the victims of this massacre?

599
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,334
We will make sure that

600
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,795
the man behind the killings,

601
00:38:18,504 --> 00:38:22,717
<i>the butler the Palacioses have entrusted</i>
<i>with their lives, will not escape justice.</i>

602
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,510
Code red.

603
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,262
Immediate change of plan.

604
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,638
We're going to the Palacioses.

605
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:33,102
They all believe
that Amando is the mastermind.

606
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,855
You know, George,

607
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,858
this is not the ending I dreamed of.
