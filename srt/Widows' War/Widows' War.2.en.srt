1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,515
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

2
00:00:15,598 --> 00:00:18,560
<i>I'm here to sympathize with you.</i>

3
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:23,690
<i>I'm here because I am hoping that</i>
<i>we can mend our friendship.</i>

4
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:24,983
<i>Really, George?</i>

5
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:27,110
You're going to patch things up
with this woman?

6
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:29,571
<i>My goodness, Sam.</i>
<i>Why did you even go there?</i>

7
00:00:29,654 --> 00:00:31,489
<i>You knew that there would be trouble.</i>

8
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,491
Let's just focus on us.

9
00:00:33,575 --> 00:00:35,118
<i>On our family.</i>

10
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:36,369
<i>You're right, Mother.</i>

11
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:39,330
<i>I'll just focus on the three of us.</i>

12
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,958
Francis? Francis,
what's happening to you?

13
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,752
Can my son be cured?

14
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:45,962
Well, he needs to start treatment
right away.

15
00:00:46,045 --> 00:00:47,797
<i>We have no money left.</i>

16
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,716
<i>It'd be fine if I only needed</i>
<i>one cycle of chemo.</i>

17
00:00:49,799 --> 00:00:51,843
<i>I have an upcoming project.</i>

18
00:00:51,926 --> 00:00:55,388
I'll be getting a huge commission.
As for you, just get well.

19
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,348
<i>Ma'am, you're taking me</i>
<i>out of the project?</i>

20
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,185
I'm sorry, Sam,
but those were Mrs. Tan's orders.

21
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:02,604
<i>It wasn't Mrs. Tan who wanted you out.</i>

22
00:01:02,687 --> 00:01:04,022
<i>It was the woman she was with.</i>

23
00:01:04,105 --> 00:01:06,775
<i>How I wish I'd seen Sam's reaction.</i>

24
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,985
<i>We didn't only lose Father, Mother.</i>

25
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:11,362
<i>We lost everything</i>
<i>that our family had achieved.</i>

26
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,782
<i>Good thing you married a rich guy.</i>

27
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:14,866
<i>Of course, Mother.</i>

28
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:16,659
<i>I made sure of that</i>

29
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,287
<i>so we could get revenge quickly on Sam.</i>

30
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:22,749
So, you've met Sam?

31
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,667
<i>Yes. We've met…</i>

32
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:26,294
<i>again.</i>

33
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:27,962
Again?

34
00:01:28,046 --> 00:01:30,757
Yeah, we've met before.

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,175
At the cemetery.

36
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,052
<i>Can you take me to Santiago?</i>

37
00:01:34,135 --> 00:01:36,387
<i>Papa worked there before.</i>

38
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,641
I just want to see
how he spent his last days.

39
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:42,435
If that's what will bring back your smile,

40
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,437
<i>then your wish is my command.</i>

41
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:45,855
<i>Welcome to our home.</i>

42
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:49,442
And, yes, it's a twin house.

43
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,111
Excuse.

44
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,947
PREVIOUSLY

45
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,629
Get out of here.

46
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:12,298
This house has been cursed.

47
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:13,550
Get out!

48
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:16,302
Save yourself or else you will die!

49
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,304
You will die in this house!

50
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:24,269
Ma'am Rebecca!

51
00:02:24,894 --> 00:02:26,229
Get Ma'am Rebecca! Hurry!

52
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:27,564
- Hurry!
- Ma'am!

53
00:02:27,647 --> 00:02:28,898
Get out of here! Hurry!

54
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,233
Get out!

55
00:02:30,316 --> 00:02:31,860
Don't! Don't! Don't!

56
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:33,278
- Don't!
- Stop it, ma'am. Ma'am!

57
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,072
- Ma'am, let's go.
- Leave. Leave!

58
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,827
Sorry.

59
00:02:42,078 --> 00:02:43,621
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am…

60
00:02:44,873 --> 00:02:45,790
Ma'am…

61
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:50,879
- You okay? Did you get hurt?
- No, I'm fine.

62
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:53,923
Who is she?

63
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:55,967
That's my cousin, Rebecca,

64
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,720
the daughter of my mother and uncle's
deceased older brother.

65
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:03,725
Mother basically raised her,
so she's practically like my baby sister.

66
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,894
We grew up in the house together.

67
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,522
Has she been like that for a long time?

68
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:11,691
No. No.

69
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,985
She used to be okay.

70
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:16,821
She only became like that
around five years ago.

71
00:03:18,156 --> 00:03:20,533
She said the house had been cursed.

72
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:22,035
Yeah. Yeah.

73
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,536
Just be patient with her.

74
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,790
She had a nervous breakdown,
I don't know, in the past.

75
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,877
That's why she says odd things sometimes.

76
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,922
But, hey, what's so cursed
about the house?

77
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,341
It looks pretty fine to me.

78
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:43,932
This

79
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:46,893
is my favorite part of the whole estate.

80
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,523
I know it might sound
a little bit childish, but…

81
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,569
whenever I'm here…

82
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,076
I feel free.

83
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,211
Have a seat.

84
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,642
Do you have siblings?

85
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:29,143
Nope.

86
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,771
Just me and a couple of cousins.

87
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,773
How about your parents?

88
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,985
Papa died when I was still a baby,

89
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:41,155
so my whole life, it's just me and Mama.

90
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,451
Are you two close?

91
00:04:58,172 --> 00:04:59,924
Here, feel this.

92
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:02,510
Can you hear that?

93
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:07,015
"Sam! Sam! Sam!"

94
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,308
You're so corny.

95
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,184
You're so grumpy.

96
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:12,437
But I promise you,

97
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:14,605
I'm gonna make you laugh and smile.

98
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,025
So hold on tight.

99
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,985
Hey! No!

100
00:05:19,068 --> 00:05:20,945
Honey, please don't--

101
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,155
Hey! Hey!

102
00:05:22,238 --> 00:05:24,240
- Watch out!
- Hey, stop it!

103
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,503
- Thank you.
- Of course.

104
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:38,504
There you go.

105
00:05:38,588 --> 00:05:41,132
I enjoyed today. Thank you.

106
00:05:41,215 --> 00:05:42,925
I'm really glad you did.

107
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:46,137
Let's do it again sometime.

108
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,597
Yes, we should.

109
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,434
Mother.

110
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,896
Good evening.

111
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,731
- Please bless me.
- Auntie Mercy…

112
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:00,401
Oh, wait. Hold on a second.

113
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:05,698
This is for you.

114
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,742
This is a Santiago specialty.

115
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:09,535
Thanks, Paco.

116
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:11,996
I'll go ahead.

117
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,956
I'll see you again.

118
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,541
Take care.

119
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,045
Have a good evening.

120
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,987
He is generous.

121
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,659
It looks like…

122
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,621
you're getting along.

123
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:56,707
I don't know, Mother.

124
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:01,129
I'm still scared.

125
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:06,008
What if he suddenly disappears,
just like Papa?

126
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:13,224
Sam…

127
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:16,060
Paco and your papa are different.

128
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:19,939
Don't let the past get in the way
of a promising future for you.

129
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,026
Do you like him?

130
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,822
Yes.

131
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:29,824
There you go.

132
00:07:30,908 --> 00:07:33,327
There's nothing wrong with loving someone.

133
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:37,540
Humans were not created to be alone.

134
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,713
I will get some coffee. I think that would
be perfect to pair with the delicacy.

135
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,214
Wait.

136
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:53,658
So, the admin building is over there

137
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:56,953
and the refinery plant is here.

138
00:08:57,036 --> 00:09:02,166
That's where the ore is brought
to extract the gold.

139
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:08,172
What's that?

140
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,592
That's where the other miners hang out.

141
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,887
Well, others live there,

142
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:20,017
although most of our employees
are from Santiago too.

143
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,827
Pa?

144
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,370
- Hey.
- Here's your coffee.

145
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,955
Black, just how you like it, right?

146
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,165
Yes. Thank you.

147
00:10:24,248 --> 00:10:25,374
Are those your presents for us?

148
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,585
Wow, thank you! That's a lot.

149
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,253
Thank you. Thank you!

150
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,881
They came from the families
of my patients in the mines.

151
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:34,216
- That's a lot! Wow.
- Yes.

152
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:37,845
They're running out of money
to buy medicine.

153
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:39,472
That's why they gave that as payment.

154
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,642
That's because
they have no health benefits.

155
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:44,226
Most of the miners there,

156
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:47,063
if they're not sick, they are injured.

157
00:10:47,146 --> 00:10:48,689
- Really?
- Yes.

158
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,777
Don't they have any…
what do they call it? Protective gear?

159
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,737
Some do, but not everyone.

160
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,657
I don't run out of patients there.

161
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:01,285
Imagine. They're mining
for gold the whole day,

162
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,705
but they only bring home a little pay
for their families.

163
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,415
I already talked to the owner.

164
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,542
The billionaire guy?

165
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:12,380
The billionaire woman.

166
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:14,882
But she can overpower any man
with her courage.

167
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,801
I spoke to her once,

168
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:22,056
hoping she would improve
the health conditions of her employees.

169
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:25,851
She told me not to meddle

170
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,104
because she might bury me in the mines.

171
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,190
- Did she say that?
- Yes, she did.

172
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,192
She's terrible, Pa.

173
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:37,279
They mine gold,
but her attitude is full of rust.

174
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,407
She's something else.

175
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,033
Thanks for the coffee. It's delicious.

176
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:44,203
Let's eat this later, Pa.

177
00:11:44,286 --> 00:11:46,914
Yes. Looks sweet, right?

178
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,213
Sam.

179
00:11:58,884 --> 00:12:00,678
You really like taking pictures?

180
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:04,223
Yeah. This is my passion.

181
00:12:04,807 --> 00:12:08,394
Once, my dream was
to become a photojournalist,

182
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:14,525
where I could submit and contribute photos
to international magazines and websites.

183
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:22,992
But Mama made me
take up Business Administration for this.

184
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:25,828
You didn't want to?

185
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:33,878
Gold may be the metal of excellence,

186
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,047
but the business behind this rot…

187
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,346
What was that?

188
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:46,515
Sam…

189
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:59,361
First commandment of Golden Palacios.

190
00:13:00,154 --> 00:13:02,907
Thou shall not steal my gold!

191
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,043
Ma'am, I'm begging you!

192
00:13:14,126 --> 00:13:17,087
I only did it for my family, ma'am.

193
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:20,132
Ma'am, I'm begging you.

194
00:13:23,928 --> 00:13:26,847
Because the punishment is death!

195
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,314
Ma'am…

196
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,982
I'm begging you.

197
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,275
It won't happen again.

198
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:39,652
Never again.

199
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:40,986
Ma'am!

200
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,446
Sam…

201
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,574
Ma'am!

202
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,503
Next time

203
00:13:58,003 --> 00:14:01,924
someone tries to steal my gold,

204
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,135
these bullets will hit your body.

205
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,683
Take him to jail.

206
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:13,269
All of you! Go back to work!

207
00:14:22,778 --> 00:14:24,530
All right. It's time to go, Sam.

208
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,698
Sam, let's go.

209
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,623
Paco! Son!

210
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,336
- Ma.
- Hi.

211
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:46,802
Yeah, we were just passing by,
but we're leaving.

212
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,013
- Let's go.
- And you must be…?

213
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,100
Sam.

214
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:55,686
Sam Castillo.

215
00:14:55,769 --> 00:14:57,479
Oh hello, Sam!

216
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,482
Sam, this is Mama, Aurora.

217
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,861
Did you see my show earlier?

218
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:05,487
Award-winning, right?

219
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:10,075
Your shooting?

220
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,243
Yes.

221
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,746
For show?

222
00:15:14,830 --> 00:15:19,501
Well, my dad taught me
a valuable lesson in business.

223
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:23,339
To get the respect of your employees,

224
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,466
always rule with an iron fist.

225
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:29,178
Or, of course,

226
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:32,681
in my case, a golden fist.

227
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:35,100
Okay, Mama. We'll see you later.

228
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,310
Sam and I will eat.

229
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:40,314
Oh, perfect! I asked them
to prepare lunch at home.

230
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,907
Maybe some other time.

231
00:15:51,408 --> 00:15:52,576
Okay.

232
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,080
I want to meet you.

233
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:57,456
Good.

234
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,291
Paco, I like her.

235
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:19,311
Thank you.

236
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,271
Paco told me

237
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,190
you're a licensed interior designer.

238
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,736
What do you think of my house?

239
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,367
It's…

240
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,161
It's big.

241
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,373
Very interesting.

242
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,417
Classy.

243
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:26,795
If you were to change anything,

244
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:29,631
what would that be?

245
00:17:44,813 --> 00:17:49,318
I think I would move the couch
and chairs there.

246
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:51,278
That way, the air could
pass through easily,

247
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,530
and it would be
more aesthetically pleasing.

248
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:55,282
It would create balance,

249
00:17:55,365 --> 00:17:57,910
just like what Paco's grandfather wanted.

250
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,079
That's the thing, you challenged her.

251
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:02,122
She was top 20 in the board exam.

252
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,665
Well, Paco here,

253
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:07,377
he just finished his two-year
MBA in STERN,

254
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:10,130
at New York University in the US.

255
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,215
Ma, please.

256
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,676
There's no shame
in flaunting achievements.

257
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,805
Did you know that Paco is intelligent?
He's one of a kind.

258
00:18:17,888 --> 00:18:21,975
In fact, he is being groomed
as the next big man of the company.

259
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,229
You know what? All this business talk
is making me hungry.

260
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:27,523
Come on, let's eat.

261
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,901
I know he doesn't want the job,

262
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:33,695
but there's nothing he can do

263
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,658
because all the men in our family
are miners.

264
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,869
Could it be that he's only concerned
about his health?

265
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,872
How's the condition in the mines?

266
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,211
Fine.

267
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,713
Everything's fine.

268
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:53,966
Shall we eat?

269
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:57,761
Amando, prepare the patio.

270
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:51,190
Aurora!

271
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:54,276
Aurora!

272
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:02,618
That's Uncle Galvan, Mama's older brother.

273
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,911
He lives in the other mansion.

274
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:11,668
What is this?

275
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:17,257
You reduced the budget
for the Santiago River Restoration. Why?

276
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:18,926
It's a waste of money.

277
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,012
You cannot restore what's already dead!

278
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:26,725
Not even God's miracle
can bring that river back to its old self.

279
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:30,354
But I made a promise
to the Natural Resources Department.

280
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:33,899
In return, they'll let
our violations slip.

281
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:36,693
Then take care of that.

282
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:40,822
Now, would you like to join us for lunch?

283
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,575
- Uncle.
- Paco.

284
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:46,078
This is Sam Castillo, my girlfriend.

285
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,330
Nice to meet you.

286
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,915
Hi, Sam.

287
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,922
I've seen this kind of bracelet before.

288
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,263
My doctor used to wear
something like that.

289
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:08,100
Yeah, Sam's dad used to be a doctor.

290
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,228
Dr. Orly Castillo?

291
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,689
Yes. He was my papa.

292
00:21:38,714 --> 00:21:39,923
Excuse me.

293
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,383
Where is the powder room?

294
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:44,219
Exit there and make a left.

295
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,762
Thank you.

296
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,204
Why are you here?

297
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:00,128
I'm looking for the powder room.

298
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:02,798
Why are you here?

299
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:06,510
You invited me for lunch.

300
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,928
Did you forget?

301
00:23:08,011 --> 00:23:09,763
That's not what I mean.

302
00:23:10,764 --> 00:23:15,352
Why are you with my son?

303
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,359
Because he likes me.

304
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,237
And I want him too.

305
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,656
It's you who said

306
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:30,492
Paco is one of a kind.

307
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:34,371
And I don't see anything wrong
with me dating your son.

308
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:37,207
- Why are you asking?
- I'm his mother.

309
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:44,214
I want to know your real intentions
regarding my one and only son.

310
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:53,014
Excuse me.

311
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,077
Okay.

312
00:24:15,412 --> 00:24:16,413
Yeah.

313
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,502
Yeah, but…

314
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:27,048
you promise you didn't get overwhelmed
by my family?

315
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,552
Okay, that's a relief.

316
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,721
I thought that after tonight,

317
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:34,848
you wouldn't talk to me again.

318
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,601
Okay.

319
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,811
Anyway, go to sleep.

320
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,315
Good night. I love you.

321
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,985
I love you, huh?

322
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,448
Paco, I haven't heard those words from you
for quite a while.

323
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:56,036
Ma, are you jealous of my girlfriend too?

324
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,540
I love you.

325
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,042
Happy?

326
00:25:02,751 --> 00:25:05,212
I know that face.

327
00:25:05,795 --> 00:25:07,839
I've seen that face before.

328
00:25:08,924 --> 00:25:10,425
You're in love.

329
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:12,719
I am.

330
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,764
I'm in love with Sam.

331
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:17,766
Are you serious with her?

332
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,518
Yes, of course. I'm 35, Ma.

333
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,813
I'm not dating for companionship.
I'm dating for marriage.

334
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:25,023
Marriage?

335
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,359
No.

336
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,694
No.

337
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,154
No, Paco.

338
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,324
You're not marrying that woman.

339
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:37,619
Never! Not on my watch.

340
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:47,170
Ma, I'm not asking you for permission.

341
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,465
I'm just informing you about my plans.

342
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:52,342
I don't like that girl.

343
00:25:52,425 --> 00:25:55,136
When did I have a girl that you liked, Ma?

344
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,640
"She's not rich enough."

345
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:00,892
"She's not decent enough."
"She's not smart enough."

346
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:03,395
No one's ever good enough for you, Ma.

347
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:08,525
You found a way to break up me
and every girlfriend I ever had.

348
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:13,029
I did what I had to do for you.

349
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:15,156
Listen to me, Paco.

350
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,866
I'm your mother.

351
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,952
I know what's best for you.

352
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:22,706
And that is not Sam.

353
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:25,125
You don't know her the way I do.

354
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:31,756
I've been working in the mining industry
for 35 years, Paco.

355
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,261
I can sense a gold digger
even from a mile.

356
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,680
You deserve someone better, son.

357
00:26:38,763 --> 00:26:41,141
What if I don't want someone better, Mom?

358
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,356
What if I just want to love someone

359
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,860
who loves me back just as much?

360
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:13,006
It's beautiful here.

361
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:14,341
Of course.

362
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:18,678
Welcome.

363
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:23,808
- Here.
- This is so sweet.

364
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,855
Thank you.

365
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,568
So I brought you here because
I wanted to say…

366
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,446
All right.

367
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:38,323
…thank you.

368
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:42,077
Thank you.

369
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:46,956
Happy monthsary.

370
00:27:50,293 --> 00:27:51,711
That's special.

371
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:55,090
I went everywhere just to look for that.

372
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:00,303
- Special?
- Yeah…

373
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,066
See.

374
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:15,235
Told you it was special.

375
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,111
Let me.

376
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:28,873
Marry me.

377
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,928
Isn't it too fast?

378
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,223
I mean, we've only been dating
for three months.

379
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:47,851
We're okay with our setup, right?

380
00:28:47,934 --> 00:28:50,895
Okay, yeah, I understand.

381
00:28:50,979 --> 00:28:52,439
I just thought…

382
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:53,857
I like you.

383
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,192
I like you so much.

384
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:58,194
I just don't want…

385
00:28:58,278 --> 00:29:00,655
I just don't want to rush things.

386
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,825
No! No! No! No! No! No! No! No!

387
00:29:03,908 --> 00:29:05,285
Wait, wait, wait.

388
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:07,036
No, no, no, no! She said no.

389
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,663
She said no.

390
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,331
What's happening?

391
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:13,251
I just prepared something special
just in case you said yes.

392
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:15,754
Oh my gosh, this is so embarrassing.

393
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:36,524
- What's funny?
- Nothing.

394
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:40,487
I was just surprised by your effort.

395
00:29:41,988 --> 00:29:43,782
You're laughing at me?

396
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:46,701
- No.
- Well, at least it's…

397
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,661
life goal achieved.

398
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:51,456
I finally made you laugh.
You can't take that back.

399
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,834
You make me laugh.

400
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:58,129
You make me smile all the time.

401
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,632
And thank you for that.

402
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,259
Don't worry.

403
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,055
I'll make you laugh more.

404
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,586
"Till death do us part"?

405
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:44,319
Why are you with my son?

406
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,362
Because he likes me.

407
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,324
And I want him too.

408
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:55,413
I want to know your real intentions
regarding my one and only son.

409
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:57,373
Excuse me.

410
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:07,592
Sam, you haven't known each other
for a year and you already said yes?

411
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,387
Francis…

412
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,432
I love Paco.

413
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:20,021
The more I get to know him, the more
I discover how good a person he is.

414
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,565
He has principles

415
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,903
and he makes me laugh.

416
00:32:26,986 --> 00:32:31,449
It's like he has restored
the smile to my face.

417
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:40,667
What did Mother say?

418
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,545
Nothing. She just asked me if I loved him.

419
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,255
I said yes.

420
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,466
She said that's what's important.

421
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:54,097
As for me, I hope
you'll get to know each other first

422
00:32:54,180 --> 00:32:58,184
because people only tend to show
their best sides at the start.

423
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,104
Francis, calm down.

424
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:04,273
We are not getting married yet.
We're just engaged, okay?

425
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,068
I'm just saying, Sam.

426
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:09,821
I don't want him to fool you.

427
00:33:11,030 --> 00:33:12,991
And if he fools around on you,
just let me know.

428
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:17,161
- Can I have some?
- Here, get some.

429
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,381
Aurora?

430
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:34,012
Finally, my late brother, Galvan Palacio.

431
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:35,388
I'm sorry.

432
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:38,850
Well, we can finally start
this family meeting.

433
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:42,895
Basil and his wife
are still on their honeymoon.

434
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:52,030
We are getting married.

435
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,491
- What?
- Yeah.

436
00:33:55,992 --> 00:33:58,411
Wow!

437
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,124
- Congratulations, Paco.
- Thank you.

438
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:05,001
Sam, welcome to the family.

439
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,419
Thank you.

440
00:34:12,258 --> 00:34:14,135
Oh, come on, Aurora.

441
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:15,595
I know that look.

442
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,680
You might as well say it now

443
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,974
if you're against the wedding

444
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:22,852
before it reaches the actual ceremony.

445
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,896
That's such a cliché.

446
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:35,281
How well do you know this woman, Paco?

447
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,454
Well enough

448
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:44,499
to know that she's the woman
I want to spend the rest of my life with.

449
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:45,958
I don't think so.

450
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,757
I had this woman investigated.

451
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,385
And the things I've read shocked me.

452
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,768
As a woman. As a mother.

453
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:18,407
What do you want to say?

454
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,992
Just say it straight.

455
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:26,290
Well, for starters, Sam's mother
had an illicit affair.

456
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,502
Do you want to know who it was with, Paco?

457
00:35:36,926 --> 00:35:39,512
Is that true, Sam?

458
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:51,482
No.

459
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,403
Because my mother was raped.

460
00:36:04,245 --> 00:36:06,497
Who gave you this information?

461
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:09,500
I hope what they're telling you
is the truth.

462
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,086
Maybe they should fact-check first.

463
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:18,968
Yes, a lot of bad things happened
to my family.

464
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:21,012
But what family has no issues?

465
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,638
Who doesn't have secrets?

466
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:24,932
Don't you, Ma'am Aurora?

467
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,311
Don't you have any secrets?

468
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,105
Haven't you ever stepped on someone else?

469
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,357
Maltreated someone?

470
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,443
This is not about me.

471
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,864
This is about you
and your family's immorality.

472
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,741
There will be no wedding.

473
00:36:41,824 --> 00:36:44,493
Not now. Not ever.

474
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:49,332
I will not let the pure Palacios name

475
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,667
be smeared with the filth
of that woman's family!

476
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:53,085
Ma, can you just stop?!

477
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,255
No, you stop it, Paco!

478
00:36:57,006 --> 00:37:00,301
Stop your illusions
about marrying this woman.

479
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,846
That trash.

480
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:06,724
Because that will never happen, Paco.

481
00:37:07,975 --> 00:37:09,310
You don't like me?

482
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,855
Then I don't like you either.

483
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:15,358
I love Paco

484
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:17,818
but I love myself too.

485
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:22,073
And I won't force myself
on the people who don't want me.

486
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:30,122
Sam!

487
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:32,917
Sam, wait!

488
00:37:33,459 --> 00:37:35,503
Sam! Sam!

489
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,206
Sam?

490
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,541
Sam, wait.

491
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,960
Sam! Sam!

492
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:18,504
Sam! Sam! Sam!

493
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,008
Let me apologize for everything Mama said.

494
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:26,637
I don't care what skeletons
you or your family have.

495
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:29,140
All I care about is you.

496
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,642
But your mother doesn't like me.

497
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,311
So?

498
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,855
She doesn't like everyone.

499
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:39,442
Besides, I'm an adult.

500
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:41,986
I know what I'm doing.

501
00:38:42,945 --> 00:38:46,240
I will choose who I want to marry,

502
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,784
and I choose you.

503
00:38:51,037 --> 00:38:52,997
Even if that's tomorrow.

504
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:00,921
Or even later.

505
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,716
Actually…

506
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,723
even now.

507
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,311
What do you think, Sam?

508
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,813
Let's get married…

509
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,149
right now.

510
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:39,460
Paco, do you take Sam to be your wife,

511
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:41,712
to love her, honor her,

512
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:45,174
and to keep her in sickness and in health,

513
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,718
for as long as you both shall live?

514
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:48,844
I do.

515
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:54,517
Sam, do you take Paco to be your husband,

516
00:39:55,101 --> 00:39:58,062
to love him, honor him,

517
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:00,981
and to keep him in sickness and in health,

518
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,234
for as long as you both shall live?

519
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,361
I do.

520
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:10,866
Paco, you may now kiss the bride.

521
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,736
Go to your quarters!

522
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:59,999
She stole my precious treasure!

523
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:02,376
She stole my son!

524
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,798
You still haven't changed.

525
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:12,553
You lose your composure
if you don't get what you want.

526
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,013
Interesting.

527
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:17,975
It's not funny!

528
00:41:18,058 --> 00:41:21,061
This is not just my problem, Galvan.

529
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:25,524
If Sam and George see each other,
it'll be trouble.

530
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:26,859
Who will be affected?

531
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:28,819
Our families!

532
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:33,324
I can talk to Basil and George.

533
00:41:33,407 --> 00:41:35,409
I don't know about you
if you can do the same

534
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,120
with your son and his wife.

535
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,958
You know, Aurora,

536
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:47,004
you can't hold your son by his throat
for the rest of his life

537
00:41:47,963 --> 00:41:52,343
and make him do whatever you want
like a puppet.

538
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,305
Like you did to your late husband.

539
00:41:56,388 --> 00:41:57,765
Like you're doing to me

540
00:41:58,474 --> 00:42:00,935
and the people around you.

541
00:42:01,644 --> 00:42:05,940
Everything I do
is for the good of this family.

542
00:42:07,358 --> 00:42:08,317
How ironic!

543
00:42:09,652 --> 00:42:13,906
You have us all by the throat,
but you can't do it with your own son.

544
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:18,494
Paco may have won this round,

545
00:42:18,577 --> 00:42:20,621
but it doesn't mean he'll win.

546
00:42:21,288 --> 00:42:23,499
I don't lose.

547
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,293
I never lose!

548
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:32,341
Why don't you like Sam?

549
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,303
Is it because of what happened
to her father?

550
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:41,183
You're scared
that she'll find out the truth.

551
00:43:36,947 --> 00:43:39,658
Sir Paco's room will be your room.

552
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:42,870
The third floor is exclusive
to Ma'am Aurora.

553
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:46,457
Only Sir Paco and Ma'am Aurora

554
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,626
are allowed to go there anytime.

555
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,048
This is Ma'am Rebecca's room.

556
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,344
- Rebecca, the…?
- Sir Paco's cousin.

557
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:50,187
You can use all the amenities here.

558
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:51,897
The pool, the gym,

559
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,775
and all of the common area.

560
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:55,984
But the thing is,

561
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:58,445
you have to share with the people
from the other house.

562
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,121
How many children does Uncle Galvan have?

563
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,331
He is living with his son.

564
00:45:09,415 --> 00:45:13,377
His son is on his way home now
with his wife.

565
00:45:17,381 --> 00:45:18,674
I'll leave you now, ma'am.

566
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:19,842
Thank you.

567
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:21,051
Okay.

568
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,813
Hey, hey, hey, my son!

569
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:15,856
Welcome back.

570
00:46:16,315 --> 00:46:17,232
Hello.

571
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:19,985
How was the honeymoon?

572
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:24,114
Expensive, but unforgettable nonetheless.

573
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:25,991
Was it successful?

574
00:46:26,533 --> 00:46:28,785
Still trying but I think this year.

575
00:46:29,411 --> 00:46:30,329
All right.

576
00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:31,413
Hi, Pa.

577
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,956
Hey, hi.

578
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,417
And you, Pa? How are you?

579
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:38,921
What's new in this… this hellhole?

580
00:46:39,004 --> 00:46:42,257
Oh, your cousin just got married.

581
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,010
Paco?

582
00:46:45,093 --> 00:46:46,261
Okay.

583
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:48,514
Who's the unlucky girl?

584
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:51,475
You'll find her very interesting,

585
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,770
especially you, George.

586
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:02,861
Okay, well, you guys take care of that.

587
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:05,113
I can't wait. I'll go see Paco now.

588
00:47:05,197 --> 00:47:06,448
Well, I'll see you around.

589
00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:07,616
See you.

590
00:47:42,484 --> 00:47:44,194
I was only gone for three months,

591
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:46,321
and suddenly you're married?

592
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,824
- That's the thing.
- Congratulations.

593
00:47:48,907 --> 00:47:50,033
- I'm in love.
- What?

594
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:51,702
- Wow, you look good.
- You too!

595
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:56,540
- Where's that wife of yours?
- Yeah, Basil, this is Sam.

596
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,335
- And Sam, this is Basil.
- Hi.

597
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,671
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- My cousin.

598
00:48:02,754 --> 00:48:04,965
He's the eldest son of Uncle Galvan.

599
00:48:05,549 --> 00:48:07,801
Paco said you just got back
from your honeymoon?

600
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:10,178
- Yes.
- I'd love to meet your wife.

601
00:48:10,262 --> 00:48:11,847
- Where is she?
- Let me go get her.

602
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:13,807
There she is.

603
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,684
- I'm here.
- My wife.

604
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:25,402
George?

605
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:29,573
You're Basil's wife?

606
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:52,262
Sam, this is George.

607
00:48:52,346 --> 00:48:54,973
You said you were excited
to meet Basil's wife.

608
00:48:57,893 --> 00:48:58,977
Of course.

609
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:04,274
You're the wife
of Paco's cousin, of course.

610
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,988
Wait, you know each other?

611
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,783
She's the best friend I told you about.

612
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:15,327
My ex-best friend.

613
00:49:17,621 --> 00:49:20,290
So you're <i>that </i>Sam Castillo.

614
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,458
Palacios.

615
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:23,710
Sam Castillo-Palacios.

616
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,629
She's my wife.

617
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,964
- Wife?
- Yeah.

618
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:32,260
George…

619
00:49:32,344 --> 00:49:34,930
we haven't seen each other
for a long time.

620
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:39,267
How long has it been?
Four, five years?

621
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,855
- George…
- Excuse me.

622
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,088
- There you go!
- Weak.

623
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:15,595
Hey, do you know that Sir Paco's wife
and Sir Basil's wife have issues?

624
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,056
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

625
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,474
- Promise.
- Issues?

626
00:50:19,558 --> 00:50:22,769
Guys, I'm on the OG's side.
Ma'am George.

627
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,855
- Ma'am George? No.
- Yes, she's my bet.

628
00:50:24,938 --> 00:50:28,358
No way. No, I prefer Ms. Sam's beauty.

629
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,820
- She's a fighter.
- Right?

630
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:33,905
Well then, let's make a bet.

631
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,533
Which of the two daughters-in-law
will be the one who lasts?

632
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:38,577
- Okay, fine.
- Fine, who's your bet?

633
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:40,078
- How much?
- I go for Ms. Sam.

634
00:50:40,162 --> 00:50:41,788
- Five hundred.
- Ma'am George.

635
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:43,123
- Seven hundred.
- Ms. Sam.

636
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,167
Didn't I tell you

637
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:50,172
that gambling is not allowed in my house?

638
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:54,468
Ma'am, we're not placing bets.

639
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,595
We were just talking.

640
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,806
DJ, get my car.

641
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:00,849
Yes, ma'am.

642
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,142
And you lot!

643
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:06,813
You're a bunch of men, and yet you're
worse than women gossiping around.

644
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,815
What were you talking about?

645
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,693
Nothing, ma'am.

646
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:28,376
Could it be that Sam stalked Paco?

647
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,296
When she found out that
you were my husband,

648
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:33,340
she wanted to be a Palacios?

649
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:38,261
Or it's the other way around.

650
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:43,099
I mean, I'm sure Paco knows Sam's history.

651
00:51:44,226 --> 00:51:48,522
Well, he knows that
he can use Sam to spite me.

652
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,234
To piss me off.

653
00:51:54,194 --> 00:51:58,448
Well, one thing's for certain.
That Sam Castillo is desperate.

654
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:03,870
She'll cling to anyone she can
as long as she benefits from it.

655
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:07,207
Just like her mother did to my father.

656
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:16,341
Nice.

657
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,095
Thank you.

658
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:22,806
Don't you worry, okay?

659
00:52:24,015 --> 00:52:25,433
I got your back.

660
00:52:26,768 --> 00:52:29,479
I will not let that woman hurt you again.

661
00:52:30,146 --> 00:52:34,025
You went through so much
because of that Sam Castillo.

662
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,319
I will not respect her.

663
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:39,406
Even if she's a woman.

664
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,702
Even if she's the wife of Paco.

665
00:52:47,706 --> 00:52:49,708
That's shameful.

666
00:52:51,543 --> 00:52:53,920
You've already helped me
and my family a lot.

667
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,716
It's my duty as your husband.

668
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:02,470
So come and give your husband a hug.

669
00:53:17,652 --> 00:53:21,698
Why didn't you tell me that George
was the wife of your cousin?

670
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,785
I had no idea that it would be an issue,
let alone that you two had a history.

671
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,372
You told me that your mom
was assaulted, that's it.

672
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,377
It's so annoying.

673
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:38,465
Of all the women Basil's wife could
have been, she's George!

674
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,759
You know that woman can't move on.

675
00:53:40,842 --> 00:53:43,887
A lot of years have passed,
and she's still bothering us.

676
00:53:45,847 --> 00:53:47,432
Told you!

677
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:52,062
From the start, this love was doomed.

678
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:55,148
All you thought about was love.

679
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:58,610
You didn't get to know each other
better first.

680
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:03,823
I don't regret marrying Sam, Ma.

681
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,742
I will protect her

682
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:07,911
if George tries to hurt her.

683
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:12,832
And I'm sure your cousin
will do the same, Paco.

684
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:15,919
It's your fault.
You should've listened to me.

685
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,546
So what will happen now?

686
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:22,092
Non-stop war of the wives?

687
00:54:30,266 --> 00:54:31,559
We'll just leave.

688
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:35,313
I'll take Sam away
so George can't hurt her.

689
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:38,233
I have a penthouse in Manila.
We'll live there.

690
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,109
No!

691
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,486
You can't leave, Paco.

692
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:44,781
Your work is here. Your life is here.

693
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,575
I am here!

694
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,996
Ma, I love you,

695
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:54,416
but Sam is my priority now.

696
00:55:10,015 --> 00:55:11,099
No.

697
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,769
We're not leaving.

698
00:55:17,856 --> 00:55:19,274
It's just George.

699
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,569
I survived several years with her.

700
00:55:22,652 --> 00:55:24,446
I can deal with her.

701
00:55:47,052 --> 00:55:49,054
Drink first.

702
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:51,306
- Thank you, Mother.
- Sam…

703
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:55,351
Can't you do what Paco wants?

704
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,979
I want you to live here in Manila

705
00:55:58,063 --> 00:56:01,066
instead of seeing that little devil
every day.

706
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:03,443
I'm not scared of George.

707
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,112
If she tries to ruin my reputation,
then I'll do the same back.

708
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,531
If she hurts me, I will hurt her too.

709
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:12,077
You take after your father.

710
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,621
Instead of you staying away from trouble,
you go for it.

711
00:56:14,704 --> 00:56:18,291
Mother, we've been avoiding them
for five years.

712
00:56:18,374 --> 00:56:20,168
It's them who keep on coming at us.

713
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,921
What are we supposed to do?
Just accept it?

714
00:56:23,004 --> 00:56:24,130
That's not okay.

715
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,926
Do you mean you want to live in
the same house as George?

716
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:30,595
Mother, it's not only George's house.

717
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:32,430
It's Paco's house too.

718
00:56:32,514 --> 00:56:34,724
And I'm also a Palacios now.

719
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:01,501
Sorry.

720
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:04,003
I spoiled your arrival.

721
00:57:05,338 --> 00:57:06,506
See?

722
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,259
We were all surprised.

723
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:14,097
Let's just hope what happened earlier
will not happen again.

724
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,600
Cheers to that.

725
00:57:25,024 --> 00:57:25,942
Although…

726
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:30,029
Paco, it's your fault.

727
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:35,493
Why did you choose a scandalous wife?

728
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:37,871
I mean, tell me again.

729
00:57:39,581 --> 00:57:43,084
How did she pass the Aurora Palacios test?

730
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,920
That's not Sam's fault.

731
00:57:46,004 --> 00:57:48,965
And from what I've heard,
it was George's dad

732
00:57:49,048 --> 00:57:52,010
- who assaulted Sam's mom.
- Oh, please.

733
00:57:52,093 --> 00:57:54,554
George's father is already dead.

734
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:57,348
Don't malign the dead.

735
00:57:57,432 --> 00:58:00,935
If only George would admit
that her father was a rapist.

736
00:58:01,019 --> 00:58:02,437
Don't talk about my wife that way.

737
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:05,064
Then don't talk about my wife
like that either, Basil.

738
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,441
Your what?

739
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,776
You barely know that woman!

740
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,280
Did you get married because I did?

741
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:16,326
Wow! Old habits die hard, Basil.

742
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,037
Up until now, you still think
this is about you?

743
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,663
Well, isn't it?

744
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,708
Isn't it true?
Who's the one who is fond of copying?

745
00:58:24,584 --> 00:58:27,670
When Pa bought me a car,
you asked Auntie Aurora to buy you a car.

746
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:28,796
Oh, come on.

747
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,549
When I told everybody that
I wanted to get an MBA,

748
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:33,218
you got ahead of me in applying for it.

749
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:35,011
And now that I'm married,

750
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,181
you marry the first woman
that says yes to you!

751
00:58:38,806 --> 00:58:40,642
Even though you know she comes
from a filthy family!

752
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:41,935
You jerk!

753
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,535
Stop it!

754
00:59:04,874 --> 00:59:07,043
How dare you hurt my son?!

755
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,836
Your son is the one who started it!

756
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,339
I don't care who started what!

757
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,968
You still have no right to hurt my son.

758
00:59:15,468 --> 00:59:20,682
Paco's life is more valuable
than you and your father combined!

759
00:59:27,814 --> 00:59:29,440
Come on, Basil.

760
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:31,276
Apologize to Paco and your auntie.

761
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:33,361
Say sorry to them. Come on.

762
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:35,238
No!

763
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:37,699
No way, Pa!

764
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:39,867
It's Paco's fault!
He thinks so highly of himself.

765
00:59:39,951 --> 00:59:43,705
Look how arrogant your son is!

766
00:59:43,788 --> 00:59:46,165
He takes after you, Galvan.

767
00:59:46,249 --> 00:59:48,668
He's all arrogance but he's not good.

768
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:01,556
Basil…

769
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,099
Basil!

770
01:00:10,398 --> 01:00:11,232
I'm sorry, Aurora.

771
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:15,570
I'll talk to Basil.

772
01:00:23,995 --> 01:00:25,371
- Are you okay?
- Ma.

773
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,831
- Did you get hurt?
- Ma, I'm good.

774
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:28,124
I'll call the doctor.

775
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:30,209
No, I'm good, Ma. Stop.

776
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:35,923
You see?

777
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:39,260
Your wife hasn't been here for a month,
and all she's brought is trouble!

778
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:40,637
You too!

779
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:46,017
Can you please not talk bad about Sam?

780
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:48,895
Please.

781
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:14,462
Basil!

782
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:20,802
If I tell you to apologize, apologize!

783
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:24,722
Don't you ever disrespect
your Auntie Aurora again!

784
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,600
This is why Auntie Aurora and Paco
look down on us!

785
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:29,268
Because of you!

786
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,439
You let your sister boss you around
even though you're the older brother!

787
01:01:34,399 --> 01:01:37,235
Just one order from her,
and your butt is shaking.

788
01:01:37,985 --> 01:01:41,072
No wonder Grandfather chose Auntie Aurora
and not you to lead the company!

789
01:01:41,155 --> 01:01:42,740
Because you don't have the balls to do it!

790
01:01:44,283 --> 01:01:45,535
Disrespectful!

791
01:01:56,421 --> 01:01:57,672
I'm Rebecca.

792
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,090
We've met already.

793
01:01:59,173 --> 01:02:00,133
When?

794
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,634
Yesterday.

795
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,553
Are you sure that it's me?

796
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:04,846
Don't touch that.

797
01:02:05,513 --> 01:02:06,764
Is that human blood?

798
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:08,015
NEXT EPISODE

799
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:10,101
I have something for you,
my son-in-law's mother.

800
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:12,895
I'd prefer you to call me "Ma'am Aurora,"
not your in-law.

801
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:13,771
All right, ma'am.

802
01:02:13,855 --> 01:02:15,523
I'll just feed my dogs.

803
01:02:15,606 --> 01:02:16,649
Thank you for this.

804
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,485
You are termites! You ruin houses!

805
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:24,031
- Who's the termite between us?
- Mother! Please stop!

806
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:27,493
- Mother!
- What the hell is happening here?
