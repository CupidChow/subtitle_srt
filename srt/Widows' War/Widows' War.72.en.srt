1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,474
<i>Galvan, you burned Paco?</i>

2
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:19,019
You didn't agree to make Basil taxidermy.

3
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:21,020
<i>I still miss Basil very much.</i>

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,230
<i>Forgive me.</i>

5
00:00:22,313 --> 00:00:24,524
<i>Now that we've forgiven each other,</i>

6
00:00:24,607 --> 00:00:27,152
<i>I'm sure the Palacios family can</i>
<i>finally start anew.</i>

7
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:29,195
<i>I think the Palacios killer</i>
<i>is still alive.</i>

8
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,155
PREVIOUSLY

9
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:32,240
- He poisoned all of us.
- Ms. Samantha?

10
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:35,785
<i>Breaker 1-9, confirm</i>
<i>if paramedics and ambulance</i>

11
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,705
<i>are en route to the Palacios residence.</i>

12
00:00:38,788 --> 00:00:40,206
<i>We have taken revenge.</i>

13
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,043
They are the reason we became like this.

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:46,379
You destroyed my family.

15
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,298
And you destroyed me.

16
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:52,218
We will seek revenge, but not my daughter.

17
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,100
Finally.

18
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,481
My plan to kill the Palacioses
is successful.

19
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:09,277
These animals believed
that I drank poison just like them.

20
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,615
Stupid.

21
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,912
I only played with all of you.

22
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:22,332
You're such a devil, Jericho.

23
00:01:22,832 --> 00:01:24,793
You're worse.

24
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,169
You're heartless.

25
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,047
I only asked you one thing

26
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,882
and that was not to include my daughter.

27
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,677
But, you didn't grant my request.
You have no soul. You have no conscience.

28
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,763
- Devil?
- Go ahead, I'll shoot you.

29
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,889
What?

30
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:41,434
These people are the devil, Vivian.

31
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,147
Did you know what hardships
we went through with them?

32
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:48,483
Did you know?

33
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:52,862
That's more than ten hells.

34
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:56,741
Dad left us to protect
us from these animals.

35
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,037
When Dad failed to come back,

36
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:05,416
Mom went crazy.

37
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,423
Mom's condition became worse.

38
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,428
She would often go out

39
00:02:18,638 --> 00:02:20,849
just to look for Dad.

40
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:24,269
But, one day
they found Mom's body in the river,

41
00:02:28,064 --> 00:02:29,190
floating.

42
00:02:30,608 --> 00:02:31,943
She's dead.

43
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:36,239
That's why I entered the military,

44
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,910
so that one day,

45
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,040
I could get back at these Palacioses.

46
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,627
And now that I'm here,

47
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,883
I discovered one evil thing

48
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,927
that these siblings did.

49
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:09,147
Sir Paco, here's the ice you asked for.

50
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,232
Thank you.

51
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:27,457
You're new here.

52
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,086
Come, join me.

53
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,880
Come on.

54
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:35,673
No, thank you, sir.

55
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:36,799
No.

56
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:41,054
No, you will join me in celebrating
the anniversary of Uncle Rodolfo's death.

57
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,096
Come on, let's go.

58
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,891
It's okay, Sir Paco.

59
00:03:45,683 --> 00:03:46,601
It's okay.

60
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,520
You know,

61
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:53,358
everyone here…

62
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:57,028
all of them have forgotten that today

63
00:03:57,111 --> 00:04:01,199
is the anniversary
of Uncle Rodolfo's death.

64
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:09,332
Or…

65
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,211
maybe they forgot about it on purpose.

66
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,255
Why is that

67
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:20,176
when Dad… Sir Rodolfo is your family?

68
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:25,974
You know what,

69
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:33,439
I think Mom and Uncle Galvan

70
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:38,611
killed Uncle Rodolfo.

71
00:04:39,779 --> 00:04:41,948
That's why there's no celebration.

72
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:47,412
They don't want to remember
what they did to their own brother.

73
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:53,334
Ma'am Aurora and Sir Galvan
killed Sir Rodolfo?

74
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,877
Believe me,

75
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,839
they killed him.

76
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:03,261
I don't know how, but they did.

77
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,515
They killed their own brother.

78
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,188
That's why he suddenly disappeared.

79
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:37,545
So, my desire to finish off
the Palacioses grew stronger.

80
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:42,759
That's why I looked for
the people who were mad at them.

81
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:49,807
I used my connection as a soldier

82
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:53,644
to find them.

83
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:57,940
I found Iñigo

84
00:06:01,652 --> 00:06:03,029
and Cairo too.

85
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:10,870
DJ and Angie.

86
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:15,083
Their parents were among

87
00:06:15,166 --> 00:06:18,711
the more than 50 miners who died…

88
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:25,051
…when Aurora and Galvan Palacios
blew up the mine with dynamite.

89
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,720
Which they blamed on Manuela Gamboa.

90
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,309
The parents of my childhood friend, Rico,
were also included in the bombing.

91
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:36,854
Will DJ and Angie be with us in your plan?

92
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,482
To eliminate the Palacioses?

93
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,526
Yes.

94
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,486
They agreed already.

95
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,571
How about you?

96
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:50,243
I agree.

97
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,496
But…

98
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:56,791
how will you let us into the estate?

99
00:06:58,417 --> 00:07:02,880
I know the owner of the agency
where Sir Amando gets his staff.

100
00:07:04,423 --> 00:07:05,675
That's how I got in.

101
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,803
And I can also bring you in.

102
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,432
Okay.

103
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,976
I'll just contact Rico.

104
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:18,020
He also wants
to seek revenge on the Palacioses.

105
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:20,898
He's in the States right now.

106
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:22,775
Great.

107
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:30,116
But, there was a little problem

108
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:34,162
because DJ and Angie backed out
because of fear.

109
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:36,247
And Iñigo?

110
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,334
I lost my trust in him

111
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,672
because he connived with someone else.

112
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,842
Juliet Gamboa.

113
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:51,304
It was okay…

114
00:07:53,389 --> 00:07:55,475
because we had the same motive…

115
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,978
eliminate all the Palacioses.

116
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,357
But, he fell in love with George.

117
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,360
That's why his strategy was destroyed.

118
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:10,281
And that's why you killed him
before he could expose you.

119
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,048
There is no devil like you, Jericho.

120
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,383
You're a user.

121
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:32,845
You used me in your plan,

122
00:08:33,554 --> 00:08:38,851
but the first thing I asked
from you was not to involve my daughter.

123
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:41,395
You didn't grant my request.

124
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:43,773
You're an animal. You're a demon.

125
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,358
Vivian, I didn't force you.

126
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,319
It was you who came to us and begged.

127
00:08:48,402 --> 00:08:52,240
You forced yourself on us
and begged to be part of the plan.

128
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:57,203
Later tonight, we will
eliminate all of the Palacioses

129
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:00,164
before Sam and George can leave.

130
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:04,418
Wait, we're really going to kill
Ma'am Sam and Ma'am George?

131
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,378
Yes.

132
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:09,340
Because they're not only
carrying the Palacios last name.

133
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:16,472
I've asked them several times,
but they keep on fighting.

134
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,892
They have been infected
by the Palacioses' evil.

135
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:22,895
But, Jericho.

136
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:25,314
No more buts, Rico.

137
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:28,234
We will kill all of them

138
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:33,864
and after that we'll go straight
to Ereso Harris's house.

139
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,826
We will kill Rebecca and the twins.

140
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:41,163
Wait, do we need to involve the kids too?

141
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:45,793
Yes, because they have the Palacios blood.

142
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:49,422
When they grow up,
they will become monsters too.

143
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:52,341
We've talked about this already, right?

144
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,885
Nothing will change in the plan.

145
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:05,104
So, you're the mastermind?

146
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,022
You are alive.

147
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,613
You will not catch me alive.

148
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,700
We'll kill each other first
before you catch me.

149
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:46,854
Alive and kicking.

150
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,610
After

151
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,654
my accident,

152
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,658
I just regained my strength

153
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:05,206
and went back
to the Palacios compound to spy around.

154
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,584
I've noticed that

155
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,962
you three are acting suspiciously.

156
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,548
That's why I followed you.

157
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:16,175
And here we are now.

158
00:11:20,221 --> 00:11:21,097
Jericho.

159
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:26,185
Why do you look scared?

160
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,646
I am your ally.

161
00:11:29,313 --> 00:11:34,443
Don't be scared
because I want to seek revenge

162
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,113
on those animals, the Palacioses.

163
00:11:37,905 --> 00:11:42,576
So, if you're planning
against the Palacioses,

164
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,537
Jericho, include me.

165
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:47,373
I will go with you. I will help you.

166
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:49,083
I can help you.

167
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,546
We don't need you in our plan.

168
00:11:54,463 --> 00:11:55,631
Yes,

169
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,843
you might not need me,

170
00:12:00,344 --> 00:12:02,680
but I need you, Jericho.

171
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:09,478
You didn't ask, but my family
is also a victim of the Palacioses.

172
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,588
My grandfather is one of

173
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,759
the miners who had a position

174
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,970
in the Palacios mines before.

175
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:46,098
I came from a well-off family.

176
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:51,687
One day there was a tragedy

177
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:53,564
in the mines.

178
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:58,486
A part of the mines collapsed.

179
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,779
Do you think

180
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:04,492
the Palacioses did anything

181
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:09,079
to help my grandfather
and the other miners?

182
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,706
Nothing.

183
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:15,878
They just let my grandfather
and the other miners

184
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:18,631
be buried alive.

185
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,510
I saw how painful that was for my family.

186
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:26,805
That's why they wanted to fight.

187
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,516
They sued them.

188
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:37,066
Until our livelihood was gone.

189
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:40,319
And why not?

190
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:45,699
How could we fight against the Palacioses?

191
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,828
So, from then on,

192
00:13:50,412 --> 00:13:55,209
I promised myself
that I would avenge my family.

193
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,255
That's why I targeted Galvan.

194
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,424
Not to kill,

195
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:07,054
but to get all his money

196
00:14:07,137 --> 00:14:09,348
and the Palacioses'.

197
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,142
But, I'm stupid.

198
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,853
I'm stupid and fell in love.

199
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,107
And we even have a daughter, Sofia.

200
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:23,195
But, I told myself, that's okay.

201
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,364
I will still push through with my plan.

202
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:29,076
I will use my own daughter, Sofia.

203
00:14:30,077 --> 00:14:35,666
She will be the sole heir,
so she can get all their wealth.

204
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:43,257
But, Aurora and Galvan's evil
has reached its peak.

205
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:46,635
They're too much already
and I can't wait anymore.

206
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,554
So, I want to seek revenge.

207
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,599
And if you kill the Palacioses,

208
00:14:52,933 --> 00:14:54,435
count me in.

209
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,566
I only have two requests.

210
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:04,528
Whatever happens,

211
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:10,200
don't involve Sofia.

212
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:12,745
Second,

213
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,334
kill all the Palacioses you want to kill,

214
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:24,089
but Galvan Palacios is mine.

215
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:29,720
I will kill Galvan Palacios.

216
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,184
Do we understand each other?

217
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,644
Jericho?

218
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,443
Well, if you insist,

219
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:46,820
okay.

220
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,617
There you go. That's it.

221
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,745
We're a team.

222
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,581
So, what's the plan now?

223
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:01,752
Here,

224
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,840
let's start with
cutting off the electricity.

225
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:11,303
Cairo, cut off the power source

226
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:18,560
and then we'll kill
the Palacioses one by one.

227
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,938
Your plan is a failure. It's a failure.

228
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:24,108
Nothing went as planned.

229
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,776
Why?

230
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,071
Who did Cairo, Rico, and I kill?

231
00:16:29,154 --> 00:16:30,406
It's just the guards.

232
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,367
We didn't kill any of the Palacioses.

233
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:35,619
Because your plans are a failure.

234
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:39,248
- Failure?
- Yes. It's a failure.

235
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,042
Vivian, it's you who failed.

236
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,255
Didn't we agree
that you would kill Galvan?

237
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:48,799
What happened?

238
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:50,467
Did you do it?

239
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,720
No, right?

240
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,398
And Galvan almost shot you.

241
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:07,026
Yes, Jericho,

242
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:08,902
I failed with Galvan

243
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:12,823
and killed two innocent people

244
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:16,535
because of your damn failed plan.

245
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:20,539
Jomar, why are you just sitting there?
Turn on the generator.

246
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,292
Jomar? Jomar.

247
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,260
While you, what?

248
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,598
Aren't you the brains behind all of this?

249
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:41,060
You are the mastermind, right?

250
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,353
But, what did you do?

251
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:45,689
You didn't kill anyone.

252
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,068
It's just Cairo, Rico,
and I who are killing people

253
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,486
while you do nothing.

254
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,779
You didn't do anything, right?

255
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,280
When Amando escaped,

256
00:17:53,363 --> 00:17:56,700
you could've done what you wanted to do,

257
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,912
so you could push through with your plan.
But, what did you do? Still nothing.

258
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,872
You became a coward.
You didn't do anything.

259
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,165
Jericho, you're a coward.

260
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,626
- You didn't do anything.
- Vivian.

261
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,505
I'm not stupid.

262
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:11,965
If we pushed through with our plan,

263
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,301
I would have been caught.

264
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,386
And Cairo and Rico too.

265
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,557
Everything was ready that night.

266
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,728
We were about to kill all the Palacioses,

267
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:31,151
but this meddlesome Amando showed up.

268
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,571
Amando is the Palacios killer.

269
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,949
Aurora.

270
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,037
Are you accusing me now
of being the Palacios killer?

271
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,582
The killer is outside.

272
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,418
He's not inside both houses.

273
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,381
And because of that jerk,

274
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,883
things became a mess.

275
00:18:56,218 --> 00:18:58,220
We got separated

276
00:18:59,096 --> 00:19:01,014
and that animal, Aurora,

277
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,642
when I found her,

278
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:07,187
she was able to hurt me.

279
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:11,567
She hit me on the head
and I lost consciousness.

280
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:26,957
Jericho?

281
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,125
Jericho?

282
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,836
You were hurt. Are you okay?

283
00:19:33,422 --> 00:19:35,549
Careful. What happened to you?

284
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,639
Are you okay?

285
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:55,110
So, what's the plan now, Jericho?

286
00:19:56,612 --> 00:19:58,322
Are we going to get rid of Ma'am Aurora?

287
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,699
This is our chance.

288
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,117
We can find her,

289
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:05,871
and then let's go to Cairo

290
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,290
to help him get rid of Sir Galvan

291
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:14,171
But, please. Let's not involve others.

292
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,924
Especially the children, Jericho.

293
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,176
Because only the two of them wronged us.

294
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:21,470
Don't be stubborn, Rico.

295
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:24,473
We won't spare anyone.

296
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,811
We will not push through with my plan.

297
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,522
Not now.

298
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,317
It's dangerous.

299
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,987
If we kill all of them

300
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,198
and Amando escapes,

301
00:20:41,949 --> 00:20:43,867
he will easily report us.

302
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,538
I should kill Amando first

303
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:52,000
and plant all the evidence

304
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:55,170
so he'll be accused.

305
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,468
Let's not rush things.

306
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,845
It's okay too.

307
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:12,062
They all believe
that Amando is the mastermind.

308
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,782
Vivian.

309
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:31,623
Vivian, look around you.

310
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,126
Is this what you call a failure?

311
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,045
We've killed all the Palacioses.

312
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,381
We had a deal, Jericho.

313
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,552
I told you that you could kill
anyone of the Palacioses,

314
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,098
Galvan and even Aurora, but not Sofia.

315
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:49,433
But, what did you do?

316
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,685
Nothing. You didn't listen to me.

317
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,645
You killed my daughter. You poisoned her.

318
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,856
You're an animal. You killed my daughter.

319
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:57,024
- You talk too much.
- You didn't even listen--

320
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,576
Are we going to report
to Sergeant Royales now?

321
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:10,704
Not yet.

322
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:22,215
Go to Ms. Ruth and Ward.

323
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:24,634
Kill them.

324
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,263
I'll take care
of Ms. Mercy and Sam's baby.

325
00:22:28,346 --> 00:22:32,392
And then we'll kill Rebecca's twins

326
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:34,061
in Suarez' house.

327
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,272
Jericho, Ms. Vivian is right.

328
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,401
We're only seeking revenge
on Ma'am Aurora and Sir Galvan.

329
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:46,198
We already involved
Rebecca, Sofia, Sam, and George.

330
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,659
Please, let's spare the babies.

331
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,787
- They're innocent.
- Rico.

332
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:56,208
Right now they are innocent.
But, they will grow up

333
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:59,461
and their personality
as Palacioses will show.

334
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,421
They are cruel,

335
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,507
oppressive,

336
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:06,343
despicable, opportunists.

337
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,428
And they kill people.

338
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,931
So, don't question my decisions.

339
00:23:11,932 --> 00:23:12,933
Okay?

340
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,435
Stick to the plan.

341
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,191
Hands up.

342
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,360
Hands up.

343
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:28,657
Call the medical team.

344
00:23:29,324 --> 00:23:30,992
Search the area. Go.

345
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,750
Sergeant Royales, good thing you came.

346
00:23:39,334 --> 00:23:40,836
We found them lying on the floor.

347
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:42,838
I think they were poisoned.

348
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,173
- We think that…
- I know the truth, Jericho.

349
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:49,427
Ms. Samantha called me
before she collapsed

350
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:51,138
and I didn't end the call.

351
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,849
I heard everything you said.

352
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:58,228
Tupaz?

353
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,902
<i>My plan to kill the Palacioses</i>
<i>is successful.</i>

354
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:10,866
<i>These animals believed that</i>
<i>I drank poison just like them.</i>

355
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,079
<i>You're so evil, Jericho.</i>

356
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:17,455
<i>There's no one as wicked as you.</i>

357
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:20,083
Are you recording
Ms. Samantha's call, Sarge?

358
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,459
Yes, Sarge.

359
00:24:23,587 --> 00:24:25,130
Team, what's your 20?

360
00:24:25,672 --> 00:24:26,923
We need to move quickly.

361
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,967
The Palacioses were poisoned.

362
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:32,262
Situation on our medical team?

363
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:35,390
<i>We're on our way,</i>
<i>approximately three kilometers away.</i>

364
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,267
We're nearer.

365
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,394
Let's meet at the Palacios gate.

366
00:24:39,477 --> 00:24:42,314
Please keep silent
when entering the Palacios gate,

367
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,441
so the suspects will not be alerted.

368
00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:53,325
And your kidnapping
of Mr. Namas and plan to frame him.

369
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,743
We already know about that too.

370
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,494
Ms. Vivian told us.

371
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:03,376
Now that Sir Amando is comatose,

372
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,879
I have a new plan.

373
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:11,051
Later, in the dinner hosted
by Auntie Aurora…

374
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:13,220
I think I want to back out, Jericho.

375
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,431
I've killed so many people already.

376
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:19,434
I only want to seek revenge
on Ma'am Aurora and Sir Galvan,

377
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:22,979
but a lot of innocent people died
because of me.

378
00:25:32,656 --> 00:25:34,908
Are you going to back out now, Rico?

379
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,452
We've already started this…

380
00:25:38,328 --> 00:25:40,121
let's just finish this.

381
00:25:42,207 --> 00:25:45,752
This is our chance to avenge our families

382
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:50,632
and bring justice to their deaths.

383
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,384
Rico,

384
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,179
just think of all the hardships
you went through.

385
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,848
Okay.

386
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,351
So, what's your new plan, Jericho?

387
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:03,645
Good.

388
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:09,985
First, we'll kidnap Sir Amando
from the hospital.

389
00:26:11,444 --> 00:26:13,822
I will make him the fall guy

390
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,907
with what I'm planning
for the dinner later.

391
00:26:15,991 --> 00:26:21,788
We will plant all the evidence we will use

392
00:26:22,289 --> 00:26:24,332
for the Palacioses' deaths on him.

393
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,751
How do you plan to kill them?

394
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,170
Simple.

395
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:33,008
Like what I did to Basil.

396
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,104
Morphine too?

397
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:47,814
Arsenic.

398
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:52,777
No color, smell, or taste.

399
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,906
We will kill all of them.

400
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:00,243
We will finish all of them.

401
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,251
Except for Sofia.

402
00:27:11,212 --> 00:27:13,340
We have an agreement, Jericho.

403
00:27:14,758 --> 00:27:16,843
You will not involve my daughter.

404
00:27:16,926 --> 00:27:18,678
We have no agreement.

405
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:22,307
I won't let you kill my daughter.

406
00:27:28,855 --> 00:27:30,106
Vivian.

407
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:33,985
Can you do it?

408
00:27:34,778 --> 00:27:35,653
Huh?

409
00:27:54,381 --> 00:27:56,174
Let's go to the hospital.

410
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,884
Rico, you drive.

411
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:00,678
Cairo and I will take Amando.

412
00:28:00,762 --> 00:28:03,681
What are we going to do
once all the Palacioses are poisoned?

413
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,184
We'll tell Sergeant Royales

414
00:28:06,684 --> 00:28:09,729
that we found
all the Palacioses lying on the floor.

415
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,565
They were poisoned by Sir Amando.

416
00:28:13,233 --> 00:28:14,192
Let's go.

417
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:19,989
Yes, Doc.

418
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:23,284
Is there a CCTV recording
of Amando Namas' escape?

419
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:24,828
He was kidnapped?

420
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,330
All right, we are on our way there.

421
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:31,084
We need to warn the Palacioses.

422
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,752
Amando might get back at them.

423
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:02,866
Miss Trano?

424
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:05,618
Ms. Trano, you're alive?

425
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,412
What happened to you?

426
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:13,710
I will explain later.

427
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:19,466
Jericho beat me up

428
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:22,594
<i>and left me</i>

429
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,806
for dead.

430
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:31,394
<i>Sergeant, listen to what I'm going to say.</i>

431
00:29:32,228 --> 00:29:33,605
It's Jericho.

432
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:38,026
He is…

433
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:45,617
Jericho is the mastermind.

434
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:50,038
He is the Palacios killer.

435
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,039
What?

436
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:53,416
<i>Cairo and Rico</i>

437
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:56,711
are his accomplices.

438
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:58,963
Team Code Red.

439
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,424
I repeat, Code Red.

440
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,218
Immediate change of plans.

441
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:06,137
Let's go to the Palacioses
instead of the hospital.

442
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,764
Priority response.

443
00:30:07,847 --> 00:30:12,393
Request paramedics, ambulance,
and toxicology team, ASAP.

444
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:14,938
You wasted your potential, Jericho.

445
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:17,899
I even admired you
because you're a good soldier.

446
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,193
You should be protecting them,

447
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:21,736
but what?

448
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,822
You used your skills for revenge.

449
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,907
I understand your anger…

450
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:30,286
but that's not the way
to get justice for your families.

451
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,539
What do you know, Sarge?

452
00:30:32,622 --> 00:30:34,374
Do you understand us?

453
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:37,001
Do you know what pain we went through
because of these people?

454
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:40,964
Because it wasn't you
whose parents were killed.

455
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,007
It wasn't you
who was deprived of a family.

456
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:44,676
It's us.

457
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:48,429
We've been through
so much suffering, Sergeant Royales.

458
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:51,766
When they killed our family,
it's as if they killed us too.

459
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,061
So, they deserve to die.

460
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:57,021
They are animals.

461
00:30:57,105 --> 00:31:00,233
You have no right to kill.

462
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:01,901
The law is not in your hands.

463
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,779
Tupaz, handcuff them.

464
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,282
- No breathing.
- No pulse.

465
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,415
- Go there. Cairo. Rico.
- Okay.

466
00:31:16,165 --> 00:31:18,042
Go ahead. Stop them
or else I will kill her.

467
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:19,377
Go ahead.

468
00:31:20,962 --> 00:31:22,297
Run.

469
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:26,801
No breathing.

470
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:28,678
No pulse.

471
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,682
Okay, start CPR now.

472
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:41,649
George?

473
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,359
George…

474
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:44,569
George?

475
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,029
George…

476
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:47,739
George…

477
00:31:53,202 --> 00:31:54,037
Thank God.

478
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,247
Thank God you're okay, George.

479
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,252
Thank God.

480
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:08,217
Time of death, 10:42 p.m.

481
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:13,056
Time of death, 10:43 p.m.

482
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:17,685
Dad…

483
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:37,538
Come on.

484
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:51,427
Cairo.

485
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:22,917
<i>Is Jericho in custody?</i>

486
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,503
<i>What's the status of Cairo and Rico?</i>

487
00:33:25,586 --> 00:33:27,380
We've taken down the two suspects.

488
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,842
Dad… Mom…

489
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:33,094
I did it.

490
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:35,722
I killed your killers.

491
00:33:36,389 --> 00:33:37,849
I killed a lot of people.

492
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,560
Forgive me.

493
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,904
She's gone, sir.

494
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:03,374
Auntie Aurora…

495
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:12,383
Miss Sam, Miss George,
thank God you're safe.

496
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:16,012
My mother and my son,
where are they? Where are they?

497
00:34:16,095 --> 00:34:17,680
Your family is safe.

498
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,850
Thank God.

499
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:24,312
Sarge, it's good that you came.

500
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,647
Vivian called me.

501
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:29,609
Vivian? Vivian is alive?

502
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:33,321
Yes. Vivian also told me
that Jericho would poison you.

503
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:34,906
Sam, George…

504
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,617
Vivian is not the mastermind.

505
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:38,993
It's Jericho.

506
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,329
He's in cahoots with Rico and Cairo.

507
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,623
He's the one who killed Basil.

508
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:45,291
What?

509
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,971
You monster.

510
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,182
You monster. You are an animal.

511
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,684
What did we do to you?

512
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:08,397
What did we do to you, Jericho? Huh?

513
00:35:08,481 --> 00:35:11,150
What did George and I do to you, Jericho?

514
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,070
Mother, my son, Aunt Ruth, Ward,

515
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:16,906
what did we do to you?

516
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,034
Why did you involve us? Huh?

517
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,288
I know…

518
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:30,211
what other sins
Uncle Galvan and Mom Aurora

519
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,171
committed against you.

520
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,008
We had nothing to do with that, Jericho.

521
00:35:37,426 --> 00:35:43,224
And Kenneth, Bill, Ando, Jomar,

522
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:46,269
all the guards you killed.

523
00:35:46,352 --> 00:35:48,146
All of them had children,

524
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:51,983
and all of them have
lost their parents because of you.

525
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,152
You are an animal.

526
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,699
The people you want to take revenge on,

527
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:04,453
the people you call monsters…

528
00:36:05,872 --> 00:36:08,749
You are the monster, Jericho.

529
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:15,882
You have become a monster
because of your desire for revenge.

530
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,469
You are a demon. You poisoned my husband.

531
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,806
You are an animal. You killed Basil.

532
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:28,019
Nurse, let her sit down first.

533
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,566
Are you happy?

534
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:39,530
And if your parents see you now…

535
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,533
do you think they are happy?

536
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,788
Huh, Jericho?

537
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,589
You are an animal.

538
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:03,262
Tupaz, check it out. Amando.

539
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:09,018
This is Jericho's hideout.

540
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:14,440
This is where they beat me
and left me to die.

541
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,236
This is where they also brought Amando

542
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:20,863
after they took him from the hospital

543
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,531
to frame him.

544
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:26,285
Jericho wants to make it
look like it was Amando

545
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:27,703
who poisoned the Palacioses,

546
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,622
and then committed suicide?

547
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:32,375
Yes.

548
00:37:32,959 --> 00:37:33,918
Sergeant…

549
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,963
my request to you.

550
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,759
Don't let my daughter know

551
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:44,720
that I'm alive.

552
00:37:46,472 --> 00:37:48,557
I don't want her to think that…

553
00:37:48,641 --> 00:37:49,558
that…

554
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:51,143
That?

555
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,566
What, Mommy?

556
00:37:58,651 --> 00:38:01,404
That you didn't just kill Francis…

557
00:38:01,988 --> 00:38:04,949
but also Jomar and Bill?

558
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,910
- Sofia, my child…
- Stop.

559
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:12,331
You know what you're going
to tell me is just a lie.

560
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,294
I heard the phone recording.

561
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:20,756
You connived with Jericho.

562
00:38:22,258 --> 00:38:24,552
I almost died, Mommy.

563
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:29,140
Sofia, please.

564
00:38:30,349 --> 00:38:32,393
What you wanted happened already.

565
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:36,772
Auntie Aurora and Daddy are dead.

566
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:42,278
You considered them monsters,
but you became a monster yourself.

567
00:38:43,654 --> 00:38:45,865
And I don't want a monster for a mother.

568
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,742
Sofia, please.

569
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,494
I hate you, Mommy. I'm disowning you.

570
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:53,205
No, no, please. Sofia, please.

571
00:38:53,956 --> 00:38:56,042
Please forgive me.

572
00:38:56,125 --> 00:39:00,296
I regret everything I've done.
I know I made a mistake.

573
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:02,340
I made a lot of mistakes.

574
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:03,507
Sofia, please.

575
00:39:03,591 --> 00:39:05,676
Mommy, I don't know if I can forgive you.

576
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,182
But, to truly forget all the lives
that you have taken…

577
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:16,437
Bill, Francis, Jomar…

578
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:20,066
I have to forget you, Mommy.

579
00:39:20,149 --> 00:39:21,984
No, no, no. Sofia, please.

580
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,320
I have to let you go.

581
00:39:25,237 --> 00:39:28,991
So what remains in me
is the memory of the mother

582
00:39:29,075 --> 00:39:31,077
that I truly love.

583
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,162
Sofia, please.

584
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:35,164
My mommy is not a murderer.

585
00:39:35,247 --> 00:39:36,791
No. No.

586
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:38,667
I'm sorry.

587
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,753
I'm so sorry.

588
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:42,797
Sorry.

589
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:52,431
Sofia.

590
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,766
Sofia.

591
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,279
Let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's eat.

592
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,448
Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go.

593
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:10,866
Let's eat here.

594
00:40:10,950 --> 00:40:12,368
Let's go, let's go.

595
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,078
Hurry up, hurry up. Careful.

596
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,039
Wow, I wish we could always be
like this, right? We're always happy.

597
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,542
Not just wish, we should.

598
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:23,003
Oh my… we should always be this happy.

599
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:26,465
Let's forget all the problems
of our family.

600
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,219
Let's clean up the Palacios name.

601
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:33,222
Let's start with these little ones.

602
00:40:34,890 --> 00:40:38,018
Right? Let's raise them
with respect for others…

603
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:42,606
With love for others,
so that they won't repeat

604
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:45,609
the evils of the Palacioses
who came before them.

605
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:47,778
Mommy, Mommy.

606
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,614
Actually, I want
to go back to the families

607
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,325
that were oppressed
by Auntie Aurora and Uncle Galvan…

608
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,078
like

609
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:58,914
Tonyo's family.

610
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,002
I'm planning to give part of my wealth

611
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:05,045
to the miners who suffered before.

612
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,298
We'll support you in that, Rebecca.

613
00:41:07,882 --> 00:41:09,675
Actually, George and I are
also thinking of setting up

614
00:41:09,758 --> 00:41:11,886
a foundation for miners.

615
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,387
Right, George?

616
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:17,349
We'll provide scholarships
for the children of miners.

617
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:19,852
We'll also do livelihood projects.

618
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,937
That's great.

619
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,064
Oh, my gosh. I'm excited. Okay, wait.

620
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,109
Can you, please,
not move to a different house?

621
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,736
Is that possible?

622
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,322
- This's it.
- What?

623
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,531
We're not moving anymore.

624
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:35,534
We're going to live together
in one house again.

625
00:41:35,618 --> 00:41:38,162
- My gosh.
- We're going back to the estate.

626
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,997
I was talking to the architect earlier.

627
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:45,753
He said the renovation
of the Palacios estate is almost finished.

628
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,379
We'll live there again.

629
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:48,589
That's fun.

630
00:41:49,632 --> 00:41:51,008
Sam…

631
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,802
My youngest has something to tell you.

632
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:55,471
Come on, Son.

633
00:41:58,307 --> 00:41:59,350
Sam…

634
00:42:00,184 --> 00:42:01,977
I just wanted to apologize.

635
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:05,397
For what?

636
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,192
When Cairo beat me,

637
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,986
Sir Galvan ordered it.

638
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,155
George blamed you,

639
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:16,534
but instead of correcting her,

640
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,453
I gave in to fear.

641
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:21,163
I'm sorry.

642
00:42:21,956 --> 00:42:26,627
Ward, let's forget everything
that happened in the past.

643
00:42:27,419 --> 00:42:28,754
That's okay.

644
00:42:28,837 --> 00:42:30,089
Thank you, Sam.

645
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:32,216
Thank you, Sam.

646
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:38,681
Mom.

647
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:41,809
Come on, let's eat.

648
00:42:41,892 --> 00:42:43,602
Okay.

649
00:42:43,686 --> 00:42:45,521
Let's eat.

650
00:42:46,021 --> 00:42:47,773
How about bread? Do you like bread?

651
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:54,196
You don't have to avoid me.

652
00:42:55,864 --> 00:42:58,367
You're not mad, Aunt Mercy?

653
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,496
I mean…

654
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,836
I'm your husband's daughter
with another woman.

655
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:13,424
They are the ones
who have wronged me, not you.

656
00:43:14,758 --> 00:43:16,427
If I was able to forgive them,

657
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:19,763
why wouldn't I forgive you?

658
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:39,533
- Come on. Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

659
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,493
Mom.

660
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,789
- Oh, you want this?
- Yes.

661
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:47,249
- You can sit here.
- Of course.

662
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:48,167
I'll stay here.

663
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,585
- There.
- Are you tired, Son?

664
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:50,878
Okay.

665
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,004
You want bread, huh?

666
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,048
Wow.

667
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:56,550
Sweet.

668
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:59,178
- Eat a lot, okay?
- Where is the…

669
00:43:59,261 --> 00:44:01,680
- Delicious.
- Let's eat.

670
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,515
I've been hungry for a while, Mom.

671
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,267
- Yes.
- You want hotdog?

672
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:07,353
Can I sit beside you, dear?

673
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,189
Come on.

674
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,692
Wow.

675
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,570
Mom, this is yours first.

676
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,864
After, okay?

677
00:44:22,242 --> 00:44:23,327
Do you want to stand?

678
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,206
- Stop crying.
- Grandson, stop crying.

679
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,668
Oh, no. Maybe he's feeling hot.

680
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:32,795
- Okay.
- The baby is feeling hot.

681
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,630
Salmon? My grandson.

682
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:37,132
My grandson is all sweaty.

683
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:43,097
He's not drinking.

684
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,556
Yes.

685
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:47,685
- Just go straight.
- Is it delicious?

686
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:03,200
Finally… all our problems are over.

687
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,577
We can finally live in peace.

688
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,295
What drama is that?

689
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,298
Nothing.

690
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,218
I guess I just…

691
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,305
I just feel so relieved…

692
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,516
that

693
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,646
with all the problems we've been through,

694
00:45:33,439 --> 00:45:35,274
we're still here…

695
00:45:36,233 --> 00:45:37,609
together…

696
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:39,903
happy.

697
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:51,748
Come on, let's go back to the cottage.

698
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,002
Maybe you can go first.

699
00:45:55,085 --> 00:45:56,712
I'll go get some air.

700
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:00,007
Okay. Hurry up, okay?

701
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:01,758
Our baby will look for us.

702
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,094
Okay, I'll follow.

703
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:31,914
Paco…

704
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,711
Paco, forgive me.

705
00:46:41,256 --> 00:46:43,967
Forgive me for the wrong I did to you.

706
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:54,978
George, Rebecca, and I talked.

707
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:58,649
We promised each other…

708
00:47:00,442 --> 00:47:04,321
that we would raise the next generation
of Palacioses properly.

709
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,451
There will be no more killings
among the Palacioses.

710
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:12,871
No more.

711
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:34,059
Sis?

712
00:47:38,564 --> 00:47:39,398
Sam?

713
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:56,290
Sergeant Royales,
what's the rumor going around?

714
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,708
What do you mean?

715
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,753
What happened to Sam wasn't
an accident, it was intentional.

716
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,755
Someone killed her.

717
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:05,173
Who?

718
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:06,717
Me.

719
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:17,603
I gave her poison.

720
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:26,278
Rebecca, no.

721
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,698
You didn't kill Sam.

722
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:32,075
She didn't die from poison.

723
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,077
She survived, remember?

724
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,663
But, she didn't die that's it, right?

725
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,332
It was me.

726
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:41,627
But, Miss Rebecca,
based on the investigation.

727
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,587
Samantha's fall was an accident.

728
00:48:44,713 --> 00:48:49,217
Maybe she was just surprised
by the lightning, by the thunder.

729
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:51,970
Even I was surprised, too.

730
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:56,058
Then I heard Sam scream.

731
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,353
Rebecca, it's starting to rain.

732
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,647
Come on, let's go inside?

733
00:49:07,069 --> 00:49:09,237
It looks like Rebecca needs
to get checked out again.

734
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:12,616
Because of what happened,
she had another mental lapse.

735
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:14,409
That's just ironic.

736
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,952
Which one?

737
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:18,830
Paco, fell off a cliff,

738
00:49:19,915 --> 00:49:22,000
accidentally pushed by Sam.

739
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:23,835
Then now,

740
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:25,879
Sam.

741
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:36,473
That's the new guy
they've been talking about,

742
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:38,725
the one who massacred the Palacioses.

743
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:41,520
That's right, the former soldier.

744
00:49:41,603 --> 00:49:44,523
Let's be careful with that one.
He can go crazy.

745
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,525
- Why did they put him here with us?
- I don't know.

746
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:49,945
Maybe he'll massacre us later.

747
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:54,241
Sir Paco…

748
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:56,743
Sir Paco…

749
00:49:58,036 --> 00:49:59,621
Sir Paco, wake up.

750
00:50:00,247 --> 00:50:01,498
Sir Paco.

751
00:50:12,134 --> 00:50:13,885
I guess it was a bit strong.

752
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,887
Does it hurt?

753
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,098
No, sir.

754
00:50:18,181 --> 00:50:19,182
It's okay.

755
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,519
I wanted to ask you
to transfer to your room.

756
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,650
It just goes to show that it's in my DNA.

757
00:50:30,152 --> 00:50:33,655
My family's crazy. I'm crazy.

758
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:39,244
That's why I'm this paranoid
and quick to get angry.

759
00:50:39,327 --> 00:50:40,912
No, you're not.

760
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,372
No.

761
00:50:43,582 --> 00:50:44,791
It's true.

762
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:50,505
Do you know how paranoid I am?

763
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,887
I believe that one day,

764
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,307
my own family will kill me.

765
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:05,228
Because that's what Palacioses do…

766
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:07,272
We kill.

767
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:12,235
We kill the environment,
we kill animals, and we kill people,

768
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:15,322
and sometimes, we even kill our own.

769
00:51:19,075 --> 00:51:23,830
When you said Sir Rodolfo was killed…

770
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,207
Yeah.

771
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,044
That's not a joke.

772
00:51:31,129 --> 00:51:33,465
So, when I die…

773
00:51:33,548 --> 00:51:38,178
I mean, when I am killed

774
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,681
and my own family does it,

775
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:45,977
Jericho, avenge me.

776
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,775
When I die, kill them all,
my whole family.

777
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:58,073
Your Ma'am Aurora, Uncle Galvan, Basil…

778
00:51:59,908 --> 00:52:02,327
Especially Basil.

779
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:09,292
Basil is the craziest one
out of all of us.

780
00:52:10,752 --> 00:52:12,796
We are all crazy.

781
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,924
We don't deserve to live.

782
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,018
Mission accomplished, Sir Paco.

783
00:52:29,479 --> 00:52:30,897
Mission accomplished.

784
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:36,194
Just be careful with that Palacios.

785
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:41,157
One of these days, he might just give in.

786
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:55,505
What are you looking at?

787
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,137
Are you whispering about me?

788
00:53:02,971 --> 00:53:04,639
Are you whispering about me?

789
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,644
Yes.

790
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,939
I'm a killer.

791
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:17,152
But, the only ones I kill are Palacioses

792
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,033
From the oldest

793
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:28,580
to the youngest.

794
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,669
I will eliminate all of them.

795
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:41,801
I will kill all the Palacios.

796
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,973
<i>I'm sorry, Son.</i>

797
00:53:48,058 --> 00:53:51,269
<i>If there's anything</i>

798
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:53,939
<i>I regret as Rodolfo Palacios.</i>

799
00:54:59,337 --> 00:55:01,047
Tonight is the night

800
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:04,718
everyone will forget you, Rodolfo.

801
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,432
Because starting tonight,

802
00:55:11,141 --> 00:55:13,018
you will not hide anymore

803
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:15,645
because Dad is gone.

804
00:55:17,397 --> 00:55:18,732
He's dead.

805
00:55:20,191 --> 00:55:22,652
So, no one can stop me.

806
00:55:23,737 --> 00:55:25,280
Not Galvan

807
00:55:26,573 --> 00:55:28,074
and not Aurora.

808
00:55:31,953 --> 00:55:34,289
You will show everyone

809
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:36,666
the real you…

810
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:43,256
Soledad.

811
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,510
Soledad Palacios.

812
00:56:12,452 --> 00:56:13,828
<i>That's you</i>

813
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:18,166
<i>because I wasn't able</i>
<i>to protect you from my siblings.</i>

814
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,129
<i>I wasn't able</i>
<i>to give you a more normal life.</i>

815
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:27,383
<i>But, if I hadn't had done that,</i>

816
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:30,762
<i>I might be like you now.</i>

817
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:36,434
<i>Maybe I'm a prisoner of madness.</i>

818
00:56:59,999 --> 00:57:00,875
Dad?

819
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:03,878
Dad…

820
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:07,674
Dad.

821
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:12,595
Dad. Why did you leave us, Dad?

822
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,472
Dad.

823
00:57:15,515 --> 00:57:16,558
Dad.

824
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:19,602
Dad.

825
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:20,854
Dad.

826
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,234
Dad.

827
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:28,027
Dad, why did you leave us?

828
00:57:28,111 --> 00:57:29,946
Why?

829
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,790
What?

830
00:57:41,833 --> 00:57:44,335
I will kill all the Palacioses.

831
00:57:44,419 --> 00:57:47,088
Remember that.

832
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,010
Dad.

833
00:57:53,928 --> 00:57:58,099
Dad. Why did you leave us, Dad? Dad.

834
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:02,604
Mom and I waited for you.

835
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:06,024
Why did you leave us?

836
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:09,110
Why?

837
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:14,491
My baby is so cute. Oh, my.

838
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:17,494
Our baby is so cute, right?

839
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:24,292
Oh, my. Even while asleep,
you still look like an angel.

840
00:58:31,090 --> 00:58:32,050
That's it.

841
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,121
Hi, Sam.

842
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,331
How are you?

843
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:49,752
You know, until now,

844
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:53,631
no one knows our secret…

845
00:59:57,468 --> 00:59:59,178
about how you fell.

846
01:00:07,979 --> 01:00:08,813
Who are you?

847
01:00:31,044 --> 01:00:34,172
Ever since you came
into the Palacioses lives,

848
01:00:36,799 --> 01:00:38,468
you've destroyed

849
01:00:39,969 --> 01:00:42,597
our once peaceful world.

850
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:46,225
You killed Paco.

851
01:00:47,393 --> 01:00:49,687
Everything went downhill from then.

852
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,106
So many people have died

853
01:00:53,149 --> 01:00:54,651
and it all started with you.

854
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,071
This killing will only really end

855
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,531
if you die yourself,

856
01:01:01,824 --> 01:01:02,909
Sam.

857
01:01:10,416 --> 01:01:12,168
An eye for an eye.

858
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,297
A death for a death.

859
01:01:19,258 --> 01:01:23,096
That's the Palacios motto.

860
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:27,392
<i>What makes a house a home?</i>

861
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:32,397
<i>Home is where peace</i>
<i>resides in all its forms.</i>

862
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,568
<i>Through justice, through stillness,</i>
<i>and through death.</i>

863
01:01:37,652 --> 01:01:39,987
<i>In death, we go home.</i>

864
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:43,032
<i>In death, there is peace.</i>
