1
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,233
I'm not hiding anything.

2
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,819
<i>I did visit Francis in jail,</i>
<i>and George was there.</i>

3
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:10,820
<i>She even fought with him.</i>

4
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,030
She made a threat.

5
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:13,823
She said she'd get revenge on all of us!

6
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:16,034
But it's an open secret that
you hate each other.

7
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:18,244
<i>You even blame her</i>
<i>for your brother being in jail.</i>

8
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:21,247
That's enough reason
to hurt Mrs. George Palacios.

9
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,708
Who could the siblings have inherited
that trait from?

10
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,043
I know!

11
00:01:25,126 --> 00:01:27,295
From their mother.

12
00:01:27,378 --> 00:01:28,254
PREVIOUSLY

13
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:30,048
How dare you slap me?!

14
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,884
Didn't you say I was a criminal?
That's the slap of a criminal.

15
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:34,636
- There you go!
- And you did it again.

16
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:37,263
There's no record of anyone named
Rodolfo Palacios here.

17
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:41,851
There was no male patient admitted here
during that period.

18
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,479
There was a female patient though.

19
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:47,023
- Who?
- Soledad Sanchez.

20
00:01:47,106 --> 00:01:47,857
Do you know her?

21
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:49,484
<i>Aren't you used to it already, madam?</i>

22
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:51,319
This isn't the first or second time

23
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,279
something like this has happened
at the estate.

24
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:57,867
Basil, Paco, and even Soledad, when…

25
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:02,288
Do not mention that woman's
name again, Amando.

26
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,415
<i>We buried her in oblivion a long time ago.</i>

27
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:07,961
Hey!

28
00:02:08,044 --> 00:02:09,087
Hey.

29
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,798
Who are you looking at?

30
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:13,216
Didn't you see that woman?

31
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:16,803
A threat against Sam
is a threat against me.

32
00:02:16,886 --> 00:02:18,805
If she's guilty of any wrongdoing,

33
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,808
<i>she will face the full wrath of the law,</i>

34
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:22,809
and mine.

35
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,228
<i>I might just solve one problem.</i>

36
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,314
How to get rid of my grandchild's mother.

37
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,108
<i>The moment Sam goes to jail,</i>

38
00:02:30,191 --> 00:02:33,027
<i>I can easily take guardianship</i>
<i>of her child.</i>

39
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:40,076
Would you like to wait for your lawyer
before we start?

40
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:44,706
No need, detective.

41
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:49,502
I can answer all your questions.

42
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:51,379
Are you sure?

43
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:55,800
Like I said, I am innocent.

44
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,093
I am not hiding anything.

45
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,512
That's why I can answer
all your questions.

46
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:00,638
Okay.

47
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,806
Let's begin.

48
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,649
Ms. Samantha Palacios,
do you have anything to do with

49
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:13,776
the disappearance
of Ms. Georgina Palacios?

50
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:15,695
No.

51
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:19,782
In fact…

52
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:23,745
you can check my directions app.

53
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,876
You can see that I came from the jail

54
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,962
and then I went straight
to the Palacios' Estate.

55
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,047
No stopovers.

56
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,757
I didn't drop by anywhere else.

57
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,427
That's why their accusation that I am
hiding George is impossible.

58
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:47,727
Can I ask for a copy of this?

59
00:03:57,779 --> 00:04:00,823
Mother, sit down first.

60
00:04:09,874 --> 00:04:10,875
Well?

61
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,378
Will you have this woman jailed?
I'll go with you.

62
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,423
Ma'am, Mrs. Palacios has a solid alibi.

63
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:21,427
It's impossible that she has anything
to do with your daughter's disappearance.

64
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,263
What, did you bribe him?

65
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:29,143
And you, how much did this woman
pay you to cover up her crime?

66
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,478
You--

67
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,067
Please be mindful of what you're saying.

68
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:39,904
That's slander.

69
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,739
I can arrest you for that.

70
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:46,661
Mother, you might end up in jail.

71
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:49,372
So what do you want me to do?

72
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,708
Forget that your sister is missing?

73
00:04:54,544 --> 00:04:57,046
You were the last person my daughter
spoke to before the trouble started.

74
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:03,303
Remember, if you did something bad
to my daughter,

75
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,846
you'll pay for it.

76
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:09,642
If I were you, I would be careful
about accusing me.

77
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:12,937
Because if you search me now
and check my things,

78
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,105
even my cell phone,

79
00:05:14,188 --> 00:05:16,316
you won't find anything fishy.

80
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,445
- Mother, let's go.
- I don't want to!

81
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,613
- Come on, hurry.
- What's with you?

82
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:33,958
- Mother.
- What's with you?

83
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,460
What's with you?

84
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:38,421
What's the matter?

85
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:39,964
I'm not yet done with Sam.

86
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:43,051
I have a strong hunch that
she's hiding your sister.

87
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:45,803
Mother, Sam has nothing to do with this.

88
00:05:45,887 --> 00:05:47,513
So now you're siding with her?

89
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,974
Go ahead and go with her then,
since you're choosing her.

90
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,142
You're conniving with her.

91
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,227
Go ahead, do what you want!
Take her side if you want to!

92
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:55,271
Mother, can you please be quiet?

93
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,775
George sent me a text.

94
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,654
So your sister is okay?

95
00:06:03,738 --> 00:06:05,823
Where is she? What happened to her?

96
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:06,949
This is what she said.

97
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:09,786
Where will we fetch her from?

98
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:11,788
She still hasn't answered but…

99
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,456
Go and text her.

100
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,875
Hurry, so we can pick up your sister.

101
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,178
- Let's hurry.
- Which hospital are you at?

102
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,679
Where?

103
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:31,516
It's the St. Therese Medical Hospital.

104
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,392
- Let's go. Hurry up!
- Okay, get in.

105
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,244
Ma'am George is in the hospital?

106
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:53,871
<i>Find her.</i>

107
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:58,376
I will give reward money
to whoever finds her.

108
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,711
Why did you stop? Let's hurry.

109
00:07:00,795 --> 00:07:03,131
Think about the reward we'll get
if we find Ms. George.

110
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:04,632
Why do you have that?

111
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:06,592
I'm just taking precautions.

112
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,719
Ma'am George has a weapon.

113
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:10,930
You're really something else.
You'll fight with a woman?

114
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:15,101
I will fight anyone
as long as there is money at stake.

115
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:20,064
Bro, Sir Galvan is offering
a reward of five million

116
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:22,066
to whoever finds Ma'am George.

117
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,610
Let's share it.

118
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,160
<i>Peter, Sir needs us.</i>

119
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:36,831
Okay, Cairo, I'm on my way there.

120
00:07:36,914 --> 00:07:37,957
Bro.

121
00:07:50,261 --> 00:07:51,345
Oh my God.

122
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:54,265
George.

123
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,520
How is the patient?

124
00:07:59,604 --> 00:08:01,147
She's doing well.

125
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,193
Would you know
if the police said anything?

126
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,573
As of now,
the police haven't said anything.

127
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:13,784
They are still interviewing the person
who witnessed the accident.

128
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,872
I will keep moving now.

129
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,457
Thank you.

130
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,968
My daughter didn't get into an accident.

131
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,347
Someone tried to kill her,

132
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:37,558
just like what they did to Beverly
when she was killed.

133
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:49,904
Mother?

134
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,405
George?

135
00:08:51,489 --> 00:08:53,950
George, how are you?

136
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,576
How are you?

137
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:00,289
Do you remember who did this to you?

138
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,672
Mother, I got into an accident.

139
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,634
No, they meant to harm you.

140
00:09:14,428 --> 00:09:16,973
They intentionally placed you in danger.

141
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,976
Who would it be?

142
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,335
Is this it?

143
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,672
Is this all the CCTV footage
from the estate?

144
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:51,299
Yes, sir, that's everything.

145
00:09:57,054 --> 00:09:58,556
I'm impressed.

146
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,642
The killer is good.

147
00:10:03,019 --> 00:10:06,647
They knew all the placements
of the CCTV cameras here.

148
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:10,443
That's why they could avoid them
without leaving any trace.

149
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,240
The crime happened around
7:00 p.m., is that right?

150
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:18,492
Yes, sir.

151
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:21,871
Before we went up to knock on the door,

152
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:24,665
the alarm on my phone went off
at 7:00 p.m.

153
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,585
Stabbing was the method of killing

154
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,253
but the murder weapon is missing.

155
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:37,845
Peter, didn't Ms. Beverly ask for
the knife in the pig's head?

156
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,806
Could that be the murder weapon
that was used to kill her?

157
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:45,436
Wait, what pig's head?

158
00:10:48,648 --> 00:10:53,861
Before Ma'am George threatened
Ma'am Beverly during the party,

159
00:10:53,944 --> 00:11:00,826
Ma'am George had already scared
Ma'am Beverly using a pig's head.

160
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:09,502
There was a knife in the pig's head,
and… the handle was orange.

161
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,253
I'll go ahead.

162
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,463
Hold on.

163
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:14,298
Can I have that?

164
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:24,433
So that just in case someone tries
to hurt me, I can defend myself.

165
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,361
So where's the pig's head?

166
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,947
I buried it.

167
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,156
You buried it?

168
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,576
Why did you meddle with it
when it's a piece of evidence?

169
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,996
Evidence?

170
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,166
Ma'am Beverly was still alive at the time.

171
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,918
- Santos?
- Yes, sir?

172
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:54,004
Have the pig's head exhumed
and bring it to the crime lab right away.

173
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,174
Have the forensics team check it
and see if the same knife was used.

174
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,968
- Do it now.
- Yes, sir.

175
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,315
We were by the river

176
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:16,861
and we looked through Beverly's window
with our binoculars.

177
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:31,459
The guy you are always with,
Edward Balay, where is he?

178
00:12:32,501 --> 00:12:34,003
I don't know.

179
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,630
Maybe you know where he is?

180
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,467
No idea.

181
00:12:40,718 --> 00:12:44,180
Hey, don't tell them.

182
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:47,266
Let's tell Sir Galvan
so we can get the reward.

183
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,101
Detective Villa?

184
00:12:49,185 --> 00:12:50,269
Sir?

185
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,271
What's this I heard?

186
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:56,025
Sergeant Casas is no longer
handling this case?

187
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:58,694
He was assigned to another case, sir.

188
00:12:58,777 --> 00:13:00,029
I am now in charge here.

189
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:01,572
You?

190
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,491
What do you know?

191
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:04,992
You're just an assistant.

192
00:13:07,578 --> 00:13:10,289
With all due respect, Mr. Palacios,

193
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:13,209
I'm just as capable
in handling this case, sir.

194
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:16,879
Galvan! Galvan!

195
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,007
Ruth and Edward are no longer
here in the house.

196
00:13:20,674 --> 00:13:23,594
It seems they are hiding too with George.

197
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,851
What were you saying?
That you can handle this case?

198
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,188
You didn't find George,

199
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:37,191
and now her mother and brother
have escaped from you.

200
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:40,819
Sir,

201
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:46,116
Jerico and I know where Ma'am George is.

202
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,759
Thank you.

203
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,178
Ruth?

204
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:10,599
We are here to get George
to bring her to the police station.

205
00:14:11,016 --> 00:14:12,351
- Sir Galvan.
- Move aside.

206
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:13,727
- Sir Galvan, please don't.
- Move!

207
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:15,229
- Please, please.
- I said move aside.

208
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,564
- Move!
- Ward! Ward!

209
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:17,606
- Move!
- Ward!

210
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,566
- Move!
- Ward!

211
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:19,900
Ward, they are going to take your sister.

212
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:20,776
Get her!

213
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,862
- Hurry!
- Don't come in.

214
00:14:22,945 --> 00:14:24,029
Don't!

215
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:27,241
Mother!

216
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,411
Just try coming closer!
We'll end up killing each other!

217
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,842
Do you think you can scare me
with your knife?

218
00:14:44,925 --> 00:14:48,053
I may not be able to hurt you seriously,
I will stab you

219
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:49,847
before I let you go near my daughter!

220
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,807
Go ahead. Do it.

221
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:54,852
- Do it!
- Mother.

222
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,437
Mother!

223
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:58,355
Mother, don't!

224
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,945
Sam?

225
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:06,864
Where are you going?

226
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,199
To see George.

227
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:10,284
Why?

228
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:12,536
Are you concerned about her?

229
00:15:13,203 --> 00:15:14,622
Are you friends now?

230
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,875
I just want to know how she is.

231
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:18,918
No!

232
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,254
What?

233
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,139
Mrs. Balay, drop your knife.

234
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:35,684
Drop the knife you're holding.

235
00:15:37,686 --> 00:15:38,896
Stay there.

236
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,149
Stay there, Mr. Palacios.

237
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,234
Are you ordering me?

238
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,237
Yes, I am ordering you.

239
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,531
What you're doing is wrong.

240
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,118
You have no right to arrest anyone.

241
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:55,913
- Men.
- Sir?

242
00:15:55,996 --> 00:15:57,581
Escort them out.

243
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,169
Your daughter will pay for what she did
to Beverly and my grandchild.

244
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:06,799
I will make sure she'll go to jail
and I'll have you arrested after.

245
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:08,509
My daughter is innocent.

246
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:09,969
She's not a criminal.

247
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,787
I don't need your permission.

248
00:16:36,870 --> 00:16:39,331
No means no, Sam.

249
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,004
Obey me or else.

250
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:48,132
You know how mad I can get, right?

251
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:55,347
Beverly was killed?

252
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,934
But why is Papa accusing me?

253
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,439
They say your bracelet was found along
the escape route the killer used

254
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,523
when they escaped.

255
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:06,483
What?

256
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,030
I have a bracelet that went missing,
but that was weeks ago.

257
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,157
I didn't kill Beverly!

258
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,159
We know that, George.

259
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,164
But we need to prove your innocence.

260
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,877
George, you need to tell me everything

261
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,962
so I can know how to defend you.

262
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,927
I went to see Francis
at the detention center.

263
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,681
You didn't only kill my husband!

264
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,767
You killed my hopes, my dreams,
and my protection.

265
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:42,478
- George, believe me. I'm innocent!
- How dare you?!

266
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:45,647
- George! Believe me, I'm innocent.
- You're a murderer!

267
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,691
- George, it wasn't me.
- Damn you!

268
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:50,694
Let go of him!
Don't hurt my brother!

269
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:54,031
Congratulations! You won!

270
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,491
You have everything.

271
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:58,869
You have the Palacios name,
you have that baby,

272
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,704
and the Palacios' Estate is already yours.

273
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,498
You can have it all to yourself!

274
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:07,169
As soon as Francis gets his sentence,
I will target you next.

275
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:10,631
Your mother too and Beverly.

276
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:14,676
All of you who destroyed my life will pay!

277
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:18,806
Sam followed.

278
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,309
I was so distraught,

279
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:24,561
I can't remember
some of the things that happened.

280
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:29,608
Even when you had the accident?

281
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:38,826
Mrs. Palacios, this is James.

282
00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:40,536
It was him who brought you here.

283
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:43,372
James, thank you.

284
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,166
I'll leave you first. I'll do my rounds.

285
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,000
Okay.

286
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,585
Thank you.

287
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:54,967
I was the one behind Ms. George's car.

288
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:57,845
<i>A car overtook her car.</i>

289
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,808
<i>I'm not sure if Ms. George noticed,</i>

290
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,019
<i>but the car in front of her made a U-turn.</i>

291
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:10,149
<i>After a while,</i>

292
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,153
<i>a car hit Ms. George's car head-on.</i>

293
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:19,324
James, you saved my life.

294
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:22,619
So thank you. I owe you my life.

295
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,419
Oh, Sam.

296
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:38,760
Didn't you want George to go to jail
instead of your brother, Francis?

297
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:41,805
Instead of visiting her at the hospital,

298
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:45,976
why don't you prove that George
is Beverly's killer?

299
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,352
Who knows?

300
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:53,192
Maybe you can also prove
that George killed Basil.

301
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:08,415
Peter, didn't Ms. Beverly ask for
the knife in the pig's head?

302
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:10,667
Could that be the murder weapon
that was used to kill her?

303
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,393
I was right.

304
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,938
What happened was not an accident.

305
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:35,609
James, the car that hit George,
what type was it?

306
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,569
Did you see the plate number?

307
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:43,408
I didn't notice because
I was focused on Ms. George's car.

308
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,663
But I'm sure it was a black car.

309
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,835
<i>Sam's car is black.</i>

310
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,464
Keep an eye on your sister.

311
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,216
I just need to go somewhere.

312
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,537
Sam?

313
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:20,047
What are you doing in George's room?

314
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:24,843
You're looking for evidence
against her, right?

315
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:36,646
What?

316
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,231
Admit it.

317
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,233
I caught you already.

318
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,623
Or could it be that Ma'am Rebecca

319
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:56,833
inherited your father's mental illness,

320
00:22:56,917 --> 00:22:59,669
and your father ended up
in a mental hospital,

321
00:22:59,753 --> 00:23:01,088
and that's why he failed to come back?

322
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,925
<i>There's no record of anyone named</i>
<i>Rodolfo Palacios here.</i>

323
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:09,971
There was no male patient admitted here
during that period.

324
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,808
There was a female patient though.

325
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:13,809
Who?

326
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:15,727
Soledad Sanchez.

327
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:16,645
Do you know her?

328
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:22,109
Hey!

329
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:23,318
Hey.

330
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:27,781
Jerico.

331
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:33,078
Help me get the five million reward
from Sir Galvan!

332
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:36,289
Peter, you should be ashamed.

333
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,750
Sir Galvan has a lot
of problems right now.

334
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:42,170
Come on, I just need the money.

335
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:45,841
Fine.

336
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,218
Yes.

337
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,931
I am looking for the murder weapon
that was used to kill Beverly

338
00:23:53,014 --> 00:23:55,267
because I want to clear my name.

339
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,351
Especially with you.

340
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,813
Didn't you say we were
a family of killers?

341
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:02,732
Is that it?

342
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,569
What's with you?
I was just joking when I said that.

343
00:24:06,153 --> 00:24:08,780
But your mother was so hot-headed.

344
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:10,615
She even slapped me.

345
00:24:11,449 --> 00:24:14,578
But don't worry, I forgive easily.

346
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:17,414
But how did it go?

347
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,541
Did you find the murder weapon?

348
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,712
Why?

349
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:25,172
Will you report me?

350
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:29,426
If you want it, just take your share.

351
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,761
You don't want to help me?

352
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,348
The man is preoccupied
with a lot of things, right?

353
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:38,894
- Why won't you help me?
- So what if I don't want to?

354
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,189
- Just try reporting me.
- Hey.

355
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:45,609
You're too much. You're such a war freak.

356
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:47,444
Of course I wouldn't.

357
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,820
Come on!

358
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,739
George is my suspect too!

359
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:57,287
That's why I'm telling Galvan
not to believe that woman.

360
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:02,042
Her alibi that she got into an accident,
her gimmicks,

361
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,419
that's nothing, she's just making it up.

362
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:07,422
But if I were you, Sam,

363
00:25:09,549 --> 00:25:12,928
I would go to
George and Basil's home office

364
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,971
and look for evidence there.

365
00:25:16,014 --> 00:25:18,266
Look for the murder weapon there.

366
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,561
Lord,

367
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:25,899
I'm begging you.

368
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:33,448
I don't object to Sam wanting
to free Francis,

369
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:37,619
but I'm against what she wants to do.

370
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:39,329
She wants to destroy George

371
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,416
for Basil's and Beverly's murders.

372
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,378
I know this is against what you want.

373
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:50,715
That's why, Lord,

374
00:25:53,385 --> 00:25:56,304
help my daughter.

375
00:25:56,846 --> 00:26:00,976
Open her mind
so she can do the right thing.

376
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,354
Go ahead. Go.

377
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,981
That's where you should search.

378
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,316
Isn't that what you want?

379
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,237
To put that woman in jail
and kick all of them out?

380
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:13,655
Go!

381
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:17,826
You're a demon!

382
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,953
Because of you,
my daughter almost got killed!

383
00:26:20,036 --> 00:26:23,331
- Let me go!
- I won't let you go!

384
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,836
- How dare you?!
- Let go of me!

385
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:28,795
Ouch! You're hurting me!

386
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,755
I had nothing to do with
what happened to George!

387
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,340
What do you mean by nothing?
You did something!

388
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,050
- You're hurting me!
- You're the reason

389
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,928
why my daughter almost got killed.

390
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:40,348
- Have you gone crazy?
- I'm not crazy!

391
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,271
Ma'am Sam and Ms. Ruth are fighting
at the other house.

392
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,691
Sam…

393
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:52,652
My daughter got hurt!

394
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,820
Ma'am, stop it!

395
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,365
- You always hurt my daughter!
- Ma'am, stop it.

396
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,368
What's with you? Let go of me!

397
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,412
- Let me go!
- Ruth!

398
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,998
Face me and not my daughter!

399
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:06,708
- You're too much!
- Mother!

400
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,211
- You always pick on my daughter!
- It's your daughter's fault!

401
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:14,341
- My daughter is innocent!
- Why do you always pick on my daughter?

402
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,301
It's your daughter's fault!

403
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:18,636
Hey! What is this again?

404
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:24,559
Aside from the bracelet
that George lost some time ago,

405
00:27:24,642 --> 00:27:29,939
what convinced Uncle Galvan
that George killed Beverly?

406
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,234
Georgina threatened Ms. Beverly.

407
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,778
With a pig's head?

408
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,364
That doesn't prove that
she killed Beverly.

409
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:41,618
Everyone at the estate witnessed
Ms. Georgina's attempt

410
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:44,162
on Beverly's life, Attorney Morales.

411
00:27:45,038 --> 00:27:49,876
Detective Villa, an attempt is different
from it actually happening.

412
00:27:49,959 --> 00:27:54,381
You need to prove
that she really did kill Ms. Beverly.

413
00:27:55,423 --> 00:27:58,760
Where is the murder weapon
that killed Ms. Beverly?

414
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:01,179
Are George's fingerprints on it?

415
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,433
There! That woman!

416
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,852
She is the one to blame
for George's accident.

417
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:09,646
Have her investigated!

418
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:12,982
Don't make up stories just to cover for
your daughter who killed Beverly!

419
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,692
How could George kill Beverly

420
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:16,986
when she was involved in an accident
because of you?

421
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:19,948
Was it because of Sam,
or was it George's doing?

422
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:20,907
You're so stupid, Mercy.

423
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:23,660
Why would George do that to herself?

424
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,620
To make sure no one would suspect her.

425
00:28:26,454 --> 00:28:29,249
Your daughter killed Beverly,
and then she escaped.

426
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:35,422
Then she orchestrated her own accident
to gain sympathy.

427
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:36,714
Come on, Attorney,

428
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,509
it's as if you're new to cases like this.

429
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,887
Ms. Beverly was the mistress
of your client's husband.

430
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:45,724
She was pregnant when she arrived.

431
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,891
That's motive.

432
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:51,896
And Ms. Georgina has made prior threats
to the life of the victim.

433
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,524
There are eyewitness testimonies.

434
00:28:55,108 --> 00:28:59,320
That can be considered
enough evidence for probable cause.

435
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,116
Mr. Palacios can easily file a case
in the fiscal office if he wants.

436
00:29:04,492 --> 00:29:06,995
Unless we furnish you with evidence
of my client's whereabouts

437
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,622
at the time of Ms. Beverly's murder.

438
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:13,418
We're going to prove to you that
she couldn't have done it

439
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,714
because my client was somewhere else
when the crime was committed.

440
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,345
I now remember everything
before the accident.

441
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,518
Sir Galvan,

442
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,438
is that what you still believe?

443
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,024
George, your daughter-in-law,
almost got killed,

444
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:38,318
and you are still insisting that
it was her doing?!

445
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,820
Or could it be

446
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,074
that you were behind her accident

447
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,202
because you wanted to kill her?

448
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,496
Who did you hire?

449
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,676
Don't you ever accuse me!

450
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,554
Get this woman out of this estate.

451
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:11,267
Tell everyone not to let this woman in!

452
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,769
My daughter is innocent.

453
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,813
Get her out!

454
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,732
- Now!
- You don't have to touch me!

455
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:19,442
You don't need to touch me!

456
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,320
Get your hands off me!

457
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:35,625
Look at the time stamp.

458
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,294
The time stamp shows

459
00:30:38,378 --> 00:30:41,714
George was at the gasoline station
at 6:53 p.m.

460
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:43,883
According to your investigation,

461
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:49,097
the murder happened between
6:55 p.m. and 7:00 p.m.

462
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,102
Attorney Morales is right, Sir Palacios.

463
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,647
We can't file a case against Ms. Georgina.

464
00:30:57,730 --> 00:31:01,234
There is valid evidence
that disproves our claim.

465
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:03,736
No!

466
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,528
Thank you.

467
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:49,032
You defended me against Auntie Ruth.

468
00:31:50,116 --> 00:31:52,619
I thought you were still mad at me.

469
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:55,705
That alibi shows

470
00:31:55,788 --> 00:31:57,707
she's not at the scene of the crime.

471
00:31:57,790 --> 00:32:01,794
But it doesn't mean that she's innocent!

472
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,341
I also have here the report
from the hospital.

473
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:11,095
A call was made at 7:15 p.m.

474
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,016
That was the time of George's accident.

475
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,894
So what you're saying is impossible.

476
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:23,483
It's not possible that George went home,
killed Beverly, escaped,

477
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:24,943
and then had an accident.

478
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:28,696
Get out.

479
00:32:30,073 --> 00:32:31,491
Everyone, get out!

480
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,760
Sam…

481
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:53,972
you're my daughter.

482
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:58,601
I could never ignore you.

483
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:04,732
I'm just scared that you might have
done something bad.

484
00:33:04,816 --> 00:33:06,651
That's why I got mad.

485
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:09,153
So you would stop.

486
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:10,822
Stop crying.

487
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,490
So you would stop.

488
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,996
Because even your father in the afterlife

489
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:22,208
will get mad at me
if I let you do something bad.

490
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:25,628
Okay?

491
00:33:28,256 --> 00:33:30,174
Please forgive me too, Sam.

492
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,138
I don't want…

493
00:33:35,221 --> 00:33:37,598
I don't want you to get in trouble.

494
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:39,851
Do you understand?

495
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:42,478
I don't want you to get in trouble.

496
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,856
Francis is already in jail.

497
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:47,191
If you go to jail too,

498
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,028
I wouldn't be able to take it anymore.

499
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,613
Mother, I won't go to jail.

500
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,490
I won't let that happen.

501
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:58,536
Don't do anything bad.

502
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:02,165
Sorry.

503
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:07,086
Don't let yourself get jailed.

504
00:34:12,842 --> 00:34:14,677
What will happen to us, George?

505
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,305
Where will we go?

506
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,852
Sir Galvan has banned me from the estate.

507
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:27,190
Let's stay in a hotel for now

508
00:34:27,273 --> 00:34:30,359
while we're looking for a new place.

509
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,781
That's better, so you can stay
away from Auntie Aurora.

510
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:37,825
<i>How dare you</i>

511
00:34:38,618 --> 00:34:40,870
come into my house,

512
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:43,331
make trouble,

513
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,583
and hurt me

514
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,294
and the mother of my grandchild?!

515
00:34:48,377 --> 00:34:52,298
Ma'am, I just want to clear George's name
because she is innocent.

516
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,591
George is innocent.

517
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,177
She did not kill Beverly, ma'am.

518
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,595
That's all.

519
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,722
Maybe you're right.

520
00:35:02,308 --> 00:35:05,353
Maybe you think

521
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:08,648
George is incapable of killing.

522
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:15,071
But I am.

523
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,700
Ward told you, didn't he?

524
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,327
That kid is so talkative.

525
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,622
Mother, I understand you.

526
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,333
You confronted Sam because of me.

527
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:32,380
Auntie Aurora threatened you,
but you weren't scared.

528
00:35:33,297 --> 00:35:35,383
That's why you confronted Sam again.

529
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:38,594
I was filled with so much anger, George.

530
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,930
I wasn't able to think straight.

531
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,766
Of course I was. You almost died.

532
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,394
No one else would make an attempt
on your life except Sam.

533
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:48,980
That's why I don't care
what they do to me.

534
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:53,025
What's important is for me to defend you
and avenge you.

535
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:55,111
Of course it is. You're my daughter.

536
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,447
Mother, thank you.

537
00:35:59,365 --> 00:36:03,119
But don't only think about me and Ward.

538
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,122
Think about yourself too.

539
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:17,425
George!

540
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:18,885
What are you doing here?

541
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:20,094
Look!

542
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,975
He was supposed to be my grandson!

543
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:30,313
Sir Galvan, stop it.

544
00:36:30,897 --> 00:36:34,775
George's evidence is solid.
My daughter is innocent.

545
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:37,028
Really?

546
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,946
Solid? Really?

547
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,949
Please, Vivian, you're not part of
this conversation, so shut up!

548
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,288
The truth is, I wanted Beverly dead.

549
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,671
That's right.

550
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,882
I wanted her dead

551
00:36:59,258 --> 00:37:01,886
after she gave birth

552
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:03,930
so I could have the baby.

553
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:14,148
I wanted Beverly's baby, Pa.

554
00:37:15,441 --> 00:37:18,486
I desperately wanted that baby.

555
00:37:21,113 --> 00:37:24,951
He would've been a way for me
to become a mother.

556
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,664
Sam?

557
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:39,590
I'm adding security here at home.

558
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,175
From now on,

559
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:44,262
someone will keep an eye on you
when you're outside your room.

560
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,516
Why?

561
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,686
Sergeant Villa told me

562
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,231
that George has an alibi.

563
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,984
She wasn't at the estate
when Beverly was stabbed.

564
00:37:58,818 --> 00:38:01,237
Galvan refuses to believe her.

565
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,780
He's still in denial

566
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:09,078
But the evidence strongly shows
that George is indeed innocent.

567
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,955
Meaning

568
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,541
the killer is still free.

569
00:38:17,086 --> 00:38:18,879
I don't want, Sam, for you…

570
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:25,761
No. I won't allow you and my grandchild
to be the next to get killed.

571
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:33,561
So if I was going to kill Beverly,

572
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,272
I would have waited for her to give birth.

573
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,107
George.

574
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,652
Did you know that I tried to buy him
from Beverly?

575
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,779
What?

576
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,657
I was so desperate, right?

577
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,035
It's humiliating.

578
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,580
But I still took the chance

579
00:38:53,205 --> 00:38:55,499
because I really wanted the baby.

580
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,295
After all, he's Basil's son.

581
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:08,304
He was supposed to be
the last memory Basil left for me.

582
00:39:09,096 --> 00:39:10,389
For us.

583
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:17,396
I wanted to love him and take care of him
like my own son.

584
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,315
Liar.

585
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:25,404
Galvan, don't believe that woman.

586
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,532
She's just lying to get your support.

587
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:30,451
No.

588
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,745
I'm telling the truth.

589
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,084
She's telling the truth.

590
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,300
I was there, Dad. I witnessed it.

591
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,112
How much do you want?

592
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,366
Fifteen million? Twenty million?
Name your price.

593
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:13,119
Even if I do,

594
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:14,495
you can't afford it.

595
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,580
You see,

596
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:20,668
this baby is priceless.

597
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,004
After I give birth,

598
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,466
I can even get more than
what you can offer.

599
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,848
George was so devastated

600
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:35,724
when Beverly rejected her offer.

601
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:38,811
She genuinely wanted that baby.

602
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,814
Well, she rejected her, right?

603
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,607
Of course, right?

604
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:49,071
Imagine. George tried to
buy Beverly's baby.

605
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:50,156
What's that?

606
00:40:50,239 --> 00:40:51,991
Desperate moves?

607
00:40:52,074 --> 00:40:53,159
You're right, Vivian.

608
00:40:53,242 --> 00:40:56,370
That's how desperate I was
to love Basil's child

609
00:40:56,454 --> 00:40:59,165
even if he came from a different woman.

610
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,584
Yeah, right.

611
00:41:02,084 --> 00:41:03,294
And, Daddy…

612
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,006
the reason Beverly didn't want
to sell the baby

613
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:08,674
was because it was priceless

614
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:13,012
and she could get more and benefit more

615
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,264
if the baby was with her.

616
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:20,686
Thank you.

617
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,606
Let's go.

618
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:24,940
Let's go!

619
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:30,821
You're so talkative!

620
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,781
I'm just telling the truth.

621
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,410
Right? Shouldn't we always tell the truth?

622
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:41,373
The truth, if it won't help you,
should be hidden!

623
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,126
That's wrong, Mommy.

624
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:45,628
Brat!

625
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:00,643
Sorry, George.

626
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,232
I'm sorry if I accused you
of killing Beverly.

627
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:10,528
I'm sorry.

628
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:16,283
It's all water under the bridge now, Pa.

629
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:20,204
I will help with the investigation.

630
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:25,251
I will hunt down the monster
who took away my husband's son.

631
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,466
It's better

632
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,886
if you hurry and pack your things.

633
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,805
You can ride with me going home.

634
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,669
Why are you frowning?

635
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,588
What are you thinking?

636
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:14,842
About the person who stabbed Beverly.
I need to find that person.

637
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,051
George,

638
00:43:16,885 --> 00:43:18,220
can we call for a time-out first?

639
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:21,640
Yes, George.

640
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:24,143
It's been a while
since we bonded like this.

641
00:43:24,226 --> 00:43:26,604
Yes, George, let's relax first.

642
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:29,356
Okay, all right, time out first.

643
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:38,365
Mother, you finished it already.

644
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,992
What's with you?

645
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,827
- Sorry, my dear.
- What's with you?

646
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,413
You even made an offer
but there's nothing left.

647
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:48,083
Ward, go buy two bottles of wine.
Just two, okay?

648
00:43:48,167 --> 00:43:50,252
- So Mother and I can have one each.
- Yes.

649
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,922
Ward, get your sister's bag.

650
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:58,969
Oh my!

651
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,805
George…

652
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:03,557
It's a knife.

653
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,059
Wait a second.

654
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:08,854
Is that the knife that was used
to stab Beverly?

655
00:44:20,282 --> 00:44:22,493
<i>- Francis, what happened to you?</i>
<i>- I'm ready to die.</i>

656
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:24,828
Francis, don't talk that way.

657
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,414
- Why is this in your bag, George?
- I don't know.

658
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:28,624
Someone put it here.

659
00:44:28,707 --> 00:44:29,875
I have cancer, remember?

660
00:44:29,958 --> 00:44:31,043
I will eventually die.

661
00:44:31,126 --> 00:44:34,046
Your sister and I will find a way.

662
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:35,464
<i>I know who it's from.</i>

663
00:44:35,547 --> 00:44:38,384
<i>It's the same bitch who left</i>
<i>morphine in my drawer</i>

664
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:39,927
to frame me up for Basil's death.

665
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:43,806
Now, she wants me to be blamed
for Beverly's death.

666
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:46,558
<i>I will return this knife to her.</i>
