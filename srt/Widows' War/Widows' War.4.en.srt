1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,891
<i>I don't want them to think that</i>
<i>they can bully you.</i>

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,686
<i>These people are monsters.</i>
<i>I grew up with them.</i>

3
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:22,188
<i>- I'm Rebecca.</i>
<i>- We've met already.</i>

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,982
- When?
- Yesterday.

5
00:00:24,065 --> 00:00:25,859
I can't remember.

6
00:00:25,942 --> 00:00:29,112
If someone hurts you
or if your husband's family oppresses you,

7
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,321
<i>just let me know.</i>

8
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,449
<i>It's the effect of his chemo.</i>

9
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,325
Santiago is so far away from Manila.

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,996
I won't be at peace if they're going back
and forth to the hospital without me.

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,248
<i>Right. Why don't they stay</i>
<i>with us at our place?</i>

12
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:43,084
<i>Use that anger to get ahead of her.</i>

13
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,627
In business.

14
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,587
In life.

15
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,590
Show Sam that you're the better person.

16
00:00:48,673 --> 00:00:50,049
The better wife.

17
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,176
<i>The better woman.</i>

18
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,886
<i>You know the rules, Sam.</i>

19
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:56,473
You're permitted to roam around
the common area,

20
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,392
but the third floor is exclusively mine.

21
00:00:59,476 --> 00:01:00,518
<i>The mother is immoral,</i>

22
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:02,395
so it makes sense that
the children are too!

23
00:01:02,479 --> 00:01:05,023
<i>- You can insult me, but not my children!</i>
<i>- Well, it's the truth!</i>

24
00:01:05,106 --> 00:01:07,358
<i>You are termites!</i>
<i>You destroy houses!</i>

25
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:10,028
They are turning my house
into a wrestling arena.

26
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,280
Let them leave now.

27
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:14,449
That woman is my wife!

28
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:16,117
Don't make me choose

29
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:18,703
because you won't like my choice.

30
00:01:18,787 --> 00:01:20,538
<i>I am here because of my husband.</i>

31
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:21,915
<i>I love Paco.</i>

32
00:01:21,998 --> 00:01:25,084
But you know, Mother, I'm also surprised
by how much he loves me.

33
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:28,254
He is willing to give up all this
just for me.

34
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:31,591
<i>George and I had a casual talk.</i>

35
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:33,676
<i>Nothing is ever casual with you.</i>

36
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,221
If you and Sam really love each other,

37
00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,889
then you shouldn't be bothered.

38
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:41,976
<i>Nothing and no one can ruin your marriage.</i>

39
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:43,311
<i>Not even me.</i>

40
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:44,395
PREVIOUSLY

41
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,288
Hon?

42
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,709
I've already checked on Francis
and Mother in their rooms.

43
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:08,586
They look comfortable.

44
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,380
Francis is already snoring.

45
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:19,973
What's wrong?

46
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,644
It's Mama.

47
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,479
It seems she's planning something.

48
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,817
If she makes a move,
there's nothing I can do.

49
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,778
Never mind.
I don't want to think about it.

50
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:35,238
It might ruin the…

51
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:41,161
Hon…

52
00:02:42,704 --> 00:02:44,330
You know, you…

53
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,209
should relax.

54
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,090
Your night might be wasted.

55
00:03:09,647 --> 00:03:11,399
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

56
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:15,194
I have a better idea.

57
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,753
Enjoy the party.

58
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:33,755
Thank you.

59
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,506
Meow.

60
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:54,525
I thought you wouldn't come, but you did.

61
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:58,488
Yeah, well, there was
a slight change of plans.

62
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,240
Welcome. Enjoy the party.

63
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:01,449
We will.

64
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,745
So this is a masquerade party?

65
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,038
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

66
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:09,207
Some sort of a masquerade party.

67
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,292
Hey…

68
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,920
Meet me upstairs.

69
00:04:15,213 --> 00:04:16,381
Okay?

70
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:54,729
Paco…

71
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,272
What are you doing?

72
00:05:56,355 --> 00:05:59,525
Paco, there are a lot of people here.
Someone might see us.

73
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,611
Paco, no, no, no, no!

74
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,945
That's even better.

75
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,823
They will be envious
of how delicious my wife is.

76
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,533
- Come on.
- Paco…

77
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,723
What are you doing?

78
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,267
It's okay. She's a friend.

79
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,770
"Friend"? She's hitting you
with a whip. What's wrong with you?

80
00:06:35,853 --> 00:06:38,815
Because she's here to teach you.

81
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:40,775
Why…?

82
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:46,656
Sam…

83
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,574
Hit me.

84
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:51,202
- No.
- Please, hit me!

85
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:52,829
- Come on.
- Paco, let's go home.

86
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,915
What's your problem?
Why are you being so rude?

87
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,375
- Come on.
- Now you're calling me rude?

88
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,086
It was who brought me to this place.
Is this your idea of fun?

89
00:07:00,169 --> 00:07:02,547
Are we going home together,
or will you go home alone?

90
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,756
Sam, grant my request.

91
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,299
Sam! Sam!

92
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:10,763
- Please! Please, grant me this, Sam.
- Paco! Paco!

93
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,057
- Grant me my request. Please.
- Paco!

94
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:14,934
- Crawl!
- Paco! You're…

95
00:07:17,478 --> 00:07:18,980
- Let me go!
- Sam!

96
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:20,481
Sam!

97
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:22,984
Sam.

98
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,612
Sam!

99
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:33,995
No! What are you doing?!

100
00:07:34,078 --> 00:07:35,204
- Let me go.
- Wow!

101
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,330
This is wild.

102
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,540
I like it.

103
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:39,709
No! Let me go!

104
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,377
Let me go!

105
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,171
You're such a pervert!

106
00:07:43,671 --> 00:07:45,006
No!

107
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,592
No!

108
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,051
Hey!

109
00:07:50,178 --> 00:07:51,846
You're all disgusting!

110
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,347
Sam…

111
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:54,932
What was that?

112
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,684
Doesn't your wife know?

113
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,957
Sam!

114
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,628
Sam!

115
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,426
Sam!

116
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:33,888
Sam!

117
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:43,856
Sam!

118
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,655
Give me the key.

119
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,198
I'm sorry, ma'am.

120
00:08:52,281 --> 00:08:53,741
- Give me the key.
- Sam!

121
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,409
Here you go.

122
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:58,120
I'll take you home, ma'am.

123
00:08:59,163 --> 00:09:00,331
Ma'am…

124
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:02,083
Sam, wait! Sam!

125
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,794
Sam!

126
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,053
Busy.

127
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,763
I'm busy this whole month.

128
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:18,641
Okay.

129
00:09:18,724 --> 00:09:20,268
I'll free up one weekend for you.

130
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,275
Goddamn it, George!
What are you doing here?

131
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,610
I'm sorry, love.

132
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:36,617
It's your fault! You're startled me.

133
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:42,999
Sam!

134
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,252
Sam, let's talk!

135
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,677
Sam!

136
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:57,263
Sam!

137
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,266
I said let's talk.

138
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:01,225
All right!

139
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,977
Okay, go ahead and explain.

140
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,978
Let's talk in private.

141
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,273
Why? Are you ashamed that people might
hear about your disgusting ways?

142
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,274
Not here.

143
00:10:08,357 --> 00:10:09,900
Let's talk here
because I want to understand.

144
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:11,277
Go ahead and explain!

145
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,446
- You're disgusting!
- I said not here!

146
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,828
Sam.

147
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,503
Sam.

148
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,048
- Let's go home.
- No.

149
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:38,929
Sam?

150
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,598
Sam?

151
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,936
Paco's all the talk
at the Indulgence right now.

152
00:10:47,355 --> 00:10:48,939
Oh, Paco.

153
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:53,194
Can't seem to keep his pants on
for one woman.

154
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,321
Indulgence?

155
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,865
A sex party.

156
00:10:57,948 --> 00:10:59,325
Paco brought Sam,

157
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:01,410
and naturally,

158
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:02,787
Sam went berserk.

159
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,248
What? Why do you know this?

160
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:08,417
I got the invitation last week.

161
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:11,337
Don't worry, love.

162
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,006
I don't attend those kind of parties.

163
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,257
It's not my style.

164
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,597
Sorry.

165
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,141
I didn't mean to hurt you,
but why are you such a war freak?

166
00:11:24,225 --> 00:11:25,851
Now it's my fault?

167
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,353
Huh? It's my fault?

168
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:29,146
I was violated, Paco.

169
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:30,898
What do you think of me?

170
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:33,692
That I'm like a prostitute
you can pass over to anyone?

171
00:11:33,776 --> 00:11:35,778
Of course not!

172
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,365
Then why are you treating me like one?

173
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:43,119
Paco, I'm your wife.

174
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,537
What, am I not enough for you?

175
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,331
You're not happy with me? Is that it?

176
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,999
No, Sam.

177
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,127
Don't touch me!

178
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,753
I'm disgusted with you!

179
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,883
Paco, I'm not trying to be righteous.

180
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:04,098
But I saved myself for the right man!
For you!

181
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,101
- But you're going to do this to me?
- I…

182
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,186
I'm so sorry.

183
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,397
I don't need your apology!

184
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:14,233
What I need are answers.
I need an explanation.

185
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,362
I didn't know it would be
that kind of party.

186
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,239
The truth is, I was shocked too.

187
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:22,324
What?

188
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,492
I was just invited.

189
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,827
It was my first time there!

190
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:31,709
That Paco has been to those parties
quite a few times.

191
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:36,422
I'm lucky my husband is not like that.

192
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:37,506
Yes.

193
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:39,967
You are very lucky.

194
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,928
You married the right Palacios,

195
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:46,348
not the rotten one.

196
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:51,061
If Sam only knew
what kind of guy she's married…

197
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,567
Is Paco hiding more secrets?

198
00:12:57,234 --> 00:13:02,072
Let's just say Rebecca
is not the only sick one in this family.

199
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,119
If anything, Paco is sicker in the mind.

200
00:13:07,786 --> 00:13:09,038
What do you mean?

201
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,459
If Sam finds out everything that
Paco's done in the past…

202
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,590
she'll go crazy.

203
00:13:24,470 --> 00:13:25,763
<i>First time?</i>

204
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,264
You knew all the people there.

205
00:13:27,348 --> 00:13:29,600
You knew your way around, and now
you're saying it was your first time?

206
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,352
It's the truth. It was my first.

207
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:33,938
Oh my God.

208
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:35,314
Oh my God, stop lying.

209
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:37,399
Please, I'm giving you the chance
to explain here.

210
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:38,442
Stop lying.

211
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,111
I am telling you the truth, Sam!
I would never lie to you!

212
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:42,404
You just did!

213
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:43,739
And you're standing by it!

214
00:13:43,822 --> 00:13:45,032
Sam…

215
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,005
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Sam?

216
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,131
Leaving.

217
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:07,012
No. You're not leaving.

218
00:14:07,846 --> 00:14:09,306
You're staying here.

219
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,101
Sam, you're not leaving.

220
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:13,519
No!

221
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:15,229
No, you're not leaving!

222
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:18,065
If you leave, I will kill myself!
Watch me!

223
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:20,067
Don't worry.

224
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:21,694
I will go to your funeral.

225
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:23,112
Sam!

226
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,280
Sam…

227
00:14:28,325 --> 00:14:29,743
Paco, what's with you?

228
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,246
Paco, what are you doing?
Have you gone crazy?!

229
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,831
- Stop it.
- Sorry, Sam.

230
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:35,332
Sam…

231
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,339
Stop that!

232
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,799
Sam, sorry.

233
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,134
Just listen to me, please.

234
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:46,594
Listen.

235
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:50,681
If you love me, you'll forgive me.

236
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:52,808
I only committed one mistake.

237
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,560
I didn't even mean it.

238
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:58,355
Don't use my love for you
to force me to forgive.

239
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:01,525
- Stop that.
- Sam, please. Sam!

240
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,327
Here, Dash.

241
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,661
Have some food.

242
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,497
Come on.

243
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:17,207
Come on and eat.

244
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:37,645
Aurora.

245
00:16:00,918 --> 00:16:03,587
I can't wait to turn that thing

246
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,048
in my collection of taxidermy.

247
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:10,135
Have you heard?

248
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,264
Your son and his wife had a fight.

249
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:15,474
No.

250
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:18,394
But am I surprised?

251
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:19,937
Not at all.

252
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,522
And I don't care

253
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:25,734
because I know that's
where they are headed.

254
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:28,112
They hardly know each other.

255
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,782
Well, if you think about it,

256
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,411
Sam doesn't really know her husband well.

257
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:41,709
What if she finds out
what Paco did five years ago?

258
00:16:44,044 --> 00:16:46,588
Shut up, Galvan,

259
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:51,468
or I will seriously turn
that stupid bird of yours

260
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,178
into a taxidermy.

261
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,856
Where are you, Dash?

262
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:07,568
My beautiful Dash.

263
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:19,705
Amando, find out where Paco is.

264
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:39,183
Paco?

265
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,396
Oh my God.

266
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,106
What happened?

267
00:17:48,275 --> 00:17:50,152
Did Sam do this to you?

268
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,869
I hate to say this, Paco,

269
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,538
but if you hadn't married Sam--

270
00:18:01,622 --> 00:18:02,831
Ma, please.

271
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,755
Don't nag me.

272
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,426
All I need…

273
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:18,180
All I need right now is support.

274
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,059
Your support.

275
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,689
Okay.

276
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:39,743
It's okay.

277
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:42,955
It's okay.

278
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:13,902
Sam…

279
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,781
What's wrong?

280
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:44,892
<i>Good thing you told me this.</i>

281
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:51,148
When it comes to love problems like that,
you should tell your best friend.

282
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,403
But good.

283
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,407
It's a good thing you broke things off
with that Gian.

284
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:03,577
But that's not enough.

285
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,704
Come on, let's take revenge on him.

286
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,540
No, I don't want to see him.
I don't want to.

287
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:16,882
Don't show Auntie Mercy your bruise.

288
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,134
You know her. She'll worry.

289
00:20:19,801 --> 00:20:21,553
You know our mothers.

290
00:20:21,637 --> 00:20:23,263
They overreact.

291
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,141
Come here.

292
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:34,316
Mother…

293
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,401
What is it?

294
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,862
I just miss…

295
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,283
I just miss Papa.

296
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,847
- You're disgusting!
- I said not here!

297
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,016
Mother?

298
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,475
What's happening?

299
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,313
Well, she dreamt of Father again.

300
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:59,192
Your father's death anniversary
is coming up.

301
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:04,197
It's been almost six years,
but it still hurts.

302
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,827
Especially now

303
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,954
when I see Mercy

304
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,498
and her children every day.

305
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,751
She reminds me every day

306
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:19,504
of all the pain and hardship
we went through

307
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,131
because of them.

308
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:36,480
George.

309
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:37,814
George.

310
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:40,817
The bank is throwing us out.

311
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:43,487
They've sent an eviction notice.

312
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:47,449
This is all the Castillo's fault.

313
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:52,829
If it hadn't been for them,
our lives wouldn't be like this.

314
00:22:53,747 --> 00:22:57,125
We still have a one-year
redemption period.

315
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:59,211
I will redeem our house.

316
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:01,671
And where will you get the money?

317
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:09,262
What if you go abroad?

318
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:10,972
What?

319
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,935
I know someone
who sends caregivers to Singapore.

320
00:23:15,018 --> 00:23:16,812
But I'm a nurse.

321
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:19,272
But you're still qualified.

322
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:22,192
Do you want me to leave?

323
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,570
George, don't leave me and Mother.

324
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:30,117
Your sister needs to go abroad
so we won't lose our house.

325
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,203
This is your father's only remaining
legacy. Right, George?

326
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,163
But what about Abdul?

327
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,375
What will you get
from that poor boyfriend of yours?

328
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,085
You should break things off with him.

329
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:49,636
Mother, stop crying.

330
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:52,472
Stop crying.

331
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:57,352
Sam and Paco are fighting right now.

332
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,771
It won't take long.

333
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:04,317
The Castillos will eventually
leave this place.

334
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,534
You don't deserve to be pitied, Sam.

335
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,835
I hope Sam will like the breakfast
that I made for her.

336
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,715
What happened to your head?

337
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,928
I know you two are having issues,

338
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:34,723
but I didn't force Sam
to tell me the details.

339
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,058
Don't worry, I'll talk to her later.

340
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,393
Okay.

341
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,270
What's this?
Are you conniving with Mother?

342
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,897
Do you want her to feel sorry for you?

343
00:24:42,772 --> 00:24:44,649
Hon, it's not like that.

344
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,736
My children,

345
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,821
whatever your problem is,

346
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,489
just fix it, please.

347
00:24:51,573 --> 00:24:53,909
Mother, I don't know if we can.

348
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,344
Francis?

349
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,513
Francis, what took you so long?

350
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,518
What's wrong? Francis?

351
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,312
Francis!

352
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:24,022
- Francis!
- Francis!

353
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,398
Francis.

354
00:25:27,442 --> 00:25:29,945
Wait. Hold on! We need
to bring him to the hospital now.

355
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:34,449
- I'll call the driver. Hold on.
- Francis, my son.

356
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,831
You ran out of morphine,

357
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:44,793
and so you worked in a call center
as a side hustle?

358
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,256
I don't want to depend on Sam
for all my medicines.

359
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:51,424
Francis, I have money.

360
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:54,219
Didn't I tell you that
I'd take care of all the expenses?

361
00:25:56,179 --> 00:25:58,223
Don't go back to your call center job.

362
00:25:58,306 --> 00:25:59,933
Staying up late is bad for you.

363
00:26:00,517 --> 00:26:01,935
No, I can still manage.

364
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,270
No, you can't.

365
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:05,814
Francis, no.

366
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,774
I'll find you a better job.

367
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:08,775
An easier one.

368
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,610
An office job.

369
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:12,112
You need to get better.

370
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:13,738
Mother needs you.

371
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,323
Sam needs you.

372
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:18,159
And I need you too.

373
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:22,038
Why is that?

374
00:26:22,122 --> 00:26:24,624
I need someone to guide me.

375
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,502
I'm not a perfect husband.

376
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:30,588
I make mistakes, and…

377
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:35,093
I just want a brother who can guide me
with my wife, okay?

378
00:26:38,722 --> 00:26:40,181
Francis, Mother,

379
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,767
I'll just call DJ.

380
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:45,603
He'll take you home, okay?

381
00:26:48,231 --> 00:26:49,316
Hon…

382
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:20,722
Mother, how is Francis?

383
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,433
He's already sleeping.

384
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,020
Okay.

385
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,985
Let me tell you something.

386
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,407
Your father once wronged me in the past.

387
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:41,785
He fooled around

388
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:44,454
and I got hurt.

389
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,706
I wanted to separate from him,

390
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:48,500
but I thought of you and Francis.

391
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:53,004
That's why when he said he would change,

392
00:27:53,797 --> 00:27:55,173
I forgave him.

393
00:27:56,633 --> 00:27:58,468
Even though it hurt?

394
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,096
It hurt so much.

395
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,555
It really did.

396
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,016
But I was able to overcome that.

397
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,770
It is difficult to be alone.

398
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:10,772
It's hard without a husband.

399
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,693
You saw me, right?

400
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:17,904
When your father died,

401
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:20,615
I became weak.

402
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:25,829
I was only happy
when I was with you and Francis.

403
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,589
It's different when you have a husband.

404
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,925
You have a partner in life.

405
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,930
You have someone to lean on
so you can create a family.

406
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,767
Do you still love Paco?

407
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,817
A lot.

408
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:01,489
Even if my mind says…

409
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:03,908
"Enough."

410
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:07,078
Can I still do it? Is it still right?

411
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,298
Paco basically grew up with me, Sam.

412
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,344
I am like his father figure.

413
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,848
That's why I know him so well.

414
00:29:27,849 --> 00:29:29,768
He is not perfect,

415
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,687
but he's not a bad person.

416
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,482
And most importantly,

417
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,984
he loves you very much.

418
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:41,196
He fought for you against his mother.

419
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,864
That's why I hope…

420
00:29:45,241 --> 00:29:47,285
you'll fight for your relationship.

421
00:31:23,381 --> 00:31:25,008
You need professional help…

422
00:31:27,093 --> 00:31:28,970
so we can fix our marriage.

423
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,850
I also want marriage counseling
so we can address your problem.

424
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:36,978
Our problem.

425
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:34,554
Dash, where are you?

426
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,055
Dash?

427
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:46,733
Dash?

428
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:47,984
Dash!

429
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:50,528
Dash!

430
00:33:50,611 --> 00:33:52,113
Dash!

431
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:55,783
Who killed my pet?!

432
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,553
Paco!

433
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:17,346
Paco!

434
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,569
No, Gema.

435
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:36,074
Paco likes to partner beer
with grilled meat, not whisky.

436
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:37,450
Kindly change it, please.

437
00:34:37,533 --> 00:34:39,160
- Okay, ma'am.
- Thank you.

438
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:29,460
Hi, love.

439
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:33,923
I have something for you.

440
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,927
Love, you've given me
a lot of pieces of jewelry.

441
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:41,139
I know, I know,
but when I saw this earlier,

442
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,974
I thought that

443
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,894
it would look really good
around your neck.

444
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,064
See?

445
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:51,274
I was correct.

446
00:35:52,024 --> 00:35:53,151
Thank you.

447
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,946
It's just my way of showing
my appreciation

448
00:35:57,029 --> 00:35:58,781
for the special things you do for me,

449
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,534
like this one.

450
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:14,172
So, the Castillos are still here.

451
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:17,466
Sam is clinging to Paco.

452
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,262
She will not leave him
even though he is hurting her.

453
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,186
Okay.

454
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:29,562
Let's give it

455
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,772
a month or two.

456
00:36:33,232 --> 00:36:34,984
If they don't leave,

457
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,404
I will find a way to make them.

458
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,781
You will do that?

459
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,118
Well…

460
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,038
Paco loves Sam.

461
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:52,210
If Sam leaves, Paco will be miserable.

462
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:55,213
He won't be able to function.

463
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:58,299
That's when I'll step in

464
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,843
to take his place in the company.

465
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:36,045
What you do?!

466
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,552
Daddy hates flowers!

467
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:44,845
I'm so sorry, madam.

468
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:46,222
- I didn't know.
- No, no, no, no.

469
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,015
You! You, you, you are stupid.

470
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,475
Madam, I'm so sorry.

471
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:55,147
- I'm so sorry, madam! I'm so sorry!
- Stupid! Stupid!

472
00:37:55,231 --> 00:37:56,774
- Madam, I'm sorry.
- You are stupid!

473
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,819
You are! You are stupid woman.

474
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:06,867
You are so stupid!

475
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,604
Hello, Mother?

476
00:38:37,106 --> 00:38:39,025
How are you?

477
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,527
I'm okay.

478
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:44,822
My bosses are okay.

479
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:46,407
George!

480
00:38:47,575 --> 00:38:49,535
George!

481
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:51,912
George!

482
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,248
George!

483
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,000
Madam! Oh! Madam!

484
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,839
You leave Daddy alone?!

485
00:39:01,922 --> 00:39:04,216
- I'm sorry, madam.
- He almost fell out of bed.

486
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:07,303
I only left him for a moment
to throw the flowers.

487
00:39:07,386 --> 00:39:11,640
No! No! No, you can't!

488
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,727
No! No, you can't!

489
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,121
Love?

490
00:39:39,668 --> 00:39:40,836
Love, are you okay?

491
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,468
I remembered
what happened to me in Singapore

492
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,845
because of Sam's family.

493
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:55,643
If it hadn't been for them,
Father wouldn't have died.

494
00:39:56,435 --> 00:40:00,147
I wouldn't have had to work
in a different country.

495
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,068
Love…

496
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,802
Oh! Rebecca.

497
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,971
You startled me.

498
00:40:42,148 --> 00:40:43,524
Rebecca?

499
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,195
Rebecca?

500
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,036
Love, don't cry anymore, okay?

501
00:40:58,706 --> 00:41:00,791
Let me take care of the Castillos.

502
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,835
All right?

503
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,880
But for now…

504
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,467
just focus on us.

505
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:11,886
All right?

506
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,515
Don't cry anymore.

507
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,860
I can't wait for us to have a baby.

508
00:41:31,113 --> 00:41:35,784
Papa said he wants to have a grandchild.

509
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,204
He hopes it's a boy

510
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:42,374
so someone can continue
the Palacios family name.

511
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:50,424
Let's eat.

512
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,343
Okay.

513
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:54,470
Great job, by the way.

514
00:41:55,971 --> 00:41:57,056
Thank you.

515
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,110
Rebecca?

516
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:59,345
Why did you call, Salvi?

517
00:43:59,428 --> 00:44:01,055
<i>You know the rules, Sam.</i>

518
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:05,267
You're permitted
to roam around the common area,

519
00:44:05,351 --> 00:44:08,687
but the third floor is exclusively mine.

520
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:19,698
I'm going to your party
even if I don't want to.

521
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:23,786
Of course, you don't need to remind me.

522
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,496
What's with you?

523
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:26,747
Yeah.

524
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,833
There's still plenty of time.

525
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,836
Yes.

526
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:35,714
I'll be on time, I promise.

527
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:37,508
Oh my.

528
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:40,010
I know, right?

529
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,181
- You might change your mind.
- Paco!

530
00:44:51,146 --> 00:44:52,314
Paco!

531
00:44:58,904 --> 00:44:59,988
Paco!

532
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,242
Paco!

533
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,911
Aurora, is your son here?

534
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:08,038
No. Why?

535
00:45:08,122 --> 00:45:10,666
Your son is such a killer.

536
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,251
He killed Dash.

537
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,212
Dash?

538
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:17,172
Who is Dash?

539
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:19,299
We don't have a helper named Dash.
What's with you?

540
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:23,137
Dash! My pet peacock!

541
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,389
He ran over it.

542
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:29,810
My goodness, Galvan. What's with you?

543
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:31,895
That's all?

544
00:45:32,688 --> 00:45:34,440
Give it to me, it's mine.

545
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:37,901
I will taxidermy your peacock.

546
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,361
Look at Diego.

547
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:42,114
See? My first cat. It's so cute.

548
00:45:42,197 --> 00:45:44,283
It still looks alive, right?

549
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,785
Don't change the topic.

550
00:45:46,869 --> 00:45:48,620
Your son is a jerk!

551
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:51,832
He ran over my pet!

552
00:45:55,335 --> 00:45:58,338
Don't blame my son. I saw what happened.

553
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,799
It was Amando.

554
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:04,303
It was Amando who ran over
your pet, not Paco.

555
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,929
Really, Aurora?

556
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,141
You're going to cover for Paco again?

557
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,977
Just like you covered for him
after what he did to Dr. Orly?

558
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:18,859
Based on the initial medico-legal report,

559
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,613
Dr. Orly died from a heroin overdose.

560
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:24,448
No.

561
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:28,035
Papa was not a drug addict
and he would never commit suicide.

562
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:32,581
All you do is cover for your son!
For his sins!

563
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,304
Don't you ever mention that doctor again!

564
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,347
Why?

565
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:53,727
Why? Are you scared that
they'll find out the truth?

566
00:47:04,947 --> 00:47:06,406
Is there someone in here with you?

567
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,783
No, I'm alone.

568
00:47:28,637 --> 00:47:30,681
- What happened?
- I'm okay.

569
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:12,723
I had nothing to do with
Dr. Orly's death!

570
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:14,391
He didn't commit suicide, Paco.

571
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:16,476
- He was killed!
- Why the hell would you think that?!

572
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,520
Because I heard your mother
and your uncle!

573
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:21,523
Sam heard it directly from
the Palacios family

574
00:48:21,607 --> 00:48:23,442
that Paco did something to Papa.

575
00:48:23,525 --> 00:48:24,985
Calm down, Francis.

576
00:48:25,068 --> 00:48:26,778
I won't calm down. I need to do something.

577
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:29,364
NEXT EPISODE

578
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:31,325
You killed my son!

579
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,703
I didn't kill him!

580
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,330
I love Paco.

581
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:37,998
I love him.

582
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:39,499
I also came to see you.

583
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,876
I want to talk to you.

584
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,586
The investigation is over, right?

585
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:43,629
It's about us.

586
00:48:43,712 --> 00:48:46,298
It's the investigator. It's Abdul.

587
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,300
- What?
- He is mad at me.

588
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:51,219
I don't know why you gave me
that kind of investigator.

589
00:48:51,303 --> 00:48:52,596
Replace him!

590
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,432
And don't accept any statement
from Basil. He's a liar.

591
00:48:55,515 --> 00:48:57,267
Pa, do you already have
findings about Paco?

592
00:48:57,351 --> 00:48:58,435
Did he really do it?

593
00:48:58,518 --> 00:49:00,354
- Did he commit suicide?
- Shut up, George!

594
00:49:00,437 --> 00:49:02,898
<i>Aside from Mr. Palacios,</i>

595
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:05,108
<i>there's another person's shoe print</i>
<i>that we found here</i>

596
00:49:05,192 --> 00:49:06,652
<i>at the crime scene.</i>

597
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,781
Stop the investigation!
There's no need for it!

598
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:12,032
It was me!

599
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,034
I killed Paco.
