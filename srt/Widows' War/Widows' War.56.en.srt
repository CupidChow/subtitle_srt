1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:16,099
<i>I followed all your orders,</i>

2
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,227
<i>even if I didn't want to,</i>
<i>even if it was against my will,</i>

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:21,771
<i>even if it's no longer right,</i>
<i>I still did it.</i>

4
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,314
Can I have this?

5
00:00:23,398 --> 00:00:24,566
What will you do with that?

6
00:00:24,649 --> 00:00:26,985
George. George…

7
00:00:27,068 --> 00:00:29,946
It would greatly reduce the pain I feel

8
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,824
if you were to lose your baby
just like me.

9
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,702
What else can you do
for your monstrous boss?

10
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:36,661
What?

11
00:00:37,287 --> 00:00:38,371
If you can hurt a woman,

12
00:00:38,455 --> 00:00:39,581
PREVIOUSLY

13
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:42,208
could you also kill for her?

14
00:00:42,292 --> 00:00:44,210
<i>You've never had a miscarriage</i>

15
00:00:45,253 --> 00:00:47,505
and that's why I'll let you feel it.

16
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:50,967
George. George…

17
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:53,928
George. George.

18
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,180
George, stop it.

19
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:56,306
George.

20
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,600
Why are you interviewing me again?

21
00:00:58,683 --> 00:01:00,393
Because of this, Mr. Namas.

22
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,372
Stop crying, George.
Something might happen to you.

23
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:24,417
That's enough, George.

24
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,300
Sir Galvan…

25
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:33,968
George…

26
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:39,140
This is him.

27
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:33,444
George…

28
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:52,213
George tried to stab you in the stomach?

29
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,631
Yes. Good thing I was able
to grab the bottle from her

30
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:55,008
and no one got hurt.

31
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:56,092
That woman is ruthless.

32
00:02:56,175 --> 00:02:57,468
- Where are you going?
- To the hospital.

33
00:02:57,552 --> 00:02:58,761
She tried to stab you

34
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,638
and she will kill your baby?

35
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,723
- Mother, don't.
- I can't let this pass.

36
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,474
Mother, don't.

37
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:07,770
Jericho, follow Mother. Hurry. Hurry.

38
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,279
George, my child.

39
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:20,783
Did you see him…

40
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,286
before the cremation?

41
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,413
Yes, Dad.

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,374
Dr. Anna showed him to me.

43
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:33,296
We weren't able to give him a name.

44
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:38,051
Actually, he has a name, Dad.

45
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,846
I already decided on it…

46
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:44,891
the day I found out that I was pregnant.

47
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:56,236
It's Basilio. "Basil",

48
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,782
meet your grandpa Galvan.

49
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:14,587
Basil…

50
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:17,048
Basilio…

51
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,550
My grandson…

52
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,432
My grandson.

53
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,444
My grandson…

54
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:42,323
My grandson…

55
00:04:43,408 --> 00:04:44,534
My grandson…

56
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,477
Why do you have this?

57
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,479
Who gave this to you?

58
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:15,023
That's no longer important.

59
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:17,859
Just answer our questions.

60
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,862
Do you suspect that I was
the one who ran Francis over?

61
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:24,198
We are just asking, Mr. Namas.

62
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:26,909
- You're being defensive.
- Why wouldn't I be defensive?

63
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:29,954
This letter has nothing
to do with the case.

64
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:31,331
This is my personal life.

65
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,167
Yes, it's personal.

66
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,586
But you wrote something there

67
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,755
that has possible involvement
with the case.

68
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:44,886
What the hell is going on here, huh?

69
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,771
Mother.

70
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,731
Ms. Mercy.

71
00:05:56,814 --> 00:05:57,815
- Mother, stop it.
- Ma'am, hold on.

72
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:00,193
Let go of me. I need to confront George.

73
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,235
Mother, stop it.

74
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:04,030
Let's just pity George. I'm begging you.

75
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,448
I also pity George,

76
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:07,408
but what happened to her
is not reason enough

77
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:09,410
for her to kill your baby. That's why…

78
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,789
Mother, George has already had
two miscarriages.

79
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,877
That's why, even if I'm mad at her

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,089
because she tried to kill me and my baby,

81
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:24,092
my pity and guilt for her…

82
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:27,303
are more dominant.

83
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:29,764
Because even if I didn't mean
what happened,

84
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,100
I am still the reason she was deprived

85
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:34,268
of the chance to be a mother.

86
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:37,605
I understand you, Sam, but…

87
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:40,775
Ma'am Mercy, I understand you,

88
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,779
but if you let the anger
in your heart prevail,

89
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,739
the problem will just get bigger.

90
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,826
Sam and my nephew are already safe.

91
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,038
There's something else we should focus on.

92
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,838
There's a new possible lead
in Francis' death.

93
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,341
What?

94
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:09,971
Read this.

95
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:27,280
I followed all your orders.

96
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,781
Even if I didn't want to,

97
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:31,242
even if it was against my will.

98
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:41,043
Even if it's no longer right,
I still did it

99
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,337
because I thought…

100
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:45,590
this was the way for you

101
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:49,343
to see me again.

102
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:56,976
Just because of this stupid
and cringe-worthy letter,

103
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,228
Amando is a suspect?

104
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:02,565
Nobody said that Mr. Namas is a suspect.

105
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,359
We're just here to ask him questions.

106
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:08,654
Well, I guess you've asked
enough questions,

107
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,656
Sergeant Royales.

108
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,243
Amando, it's your right not to talk.

109
00:08:14,327 --> 00:08:15,745
And if you going to talk,

110
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:18,456
wait for my lawyer to be present.

111
00:08:28,382 --> 00:08:31,636
What are you looking at, Sergeant Royales?

112
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:33,721
Nothing much.

113
00:08:33,804 --> 00:08:35,139
You know, I just found your reaction--

114
00:08:35,223 --> 00:08:39,018
You found my reaction what?

115
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,978
Let's go, Sarge.

116
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:54,784
Sir Amando is a minion of Auntie Aurora.

117
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,538
He follows what your mother-in-law wants.

118
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,332
He's also a secret keeper.

119
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:05,044
He is an accomplice
in hiding Rebecca's children.

120
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:07,588
And he can hurt people too.

121
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,715
She slapped me earlier.

122
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:12,176
What?

123
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,974
Aurora and her twin evil friend
ganged up on me.

124
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:23,229
Amando slapped me
when I almost retaliated at Aurora.

125
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,775
- He's an animal.
- Ma'am Sam, wait.

126
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,613
We need to think carefully
about our next move.

127
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:38,202
There's a big possibility that Aurora
ordered Amando to run me over,

128
00:09:38,286 --> 00:09:41,163
but Francis became the victim.

129
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:44,500
Or it's possible that Aurora
didn't give him orders…

130
00:09:45,668 --> 00:09:46,836
but he voluntarily did it

131
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:50,881
to prove how much he loves Auntie Aurora.

132
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:54,427
Auntie Aurora's enemy is his enemy too.

133
00:09:57,847 --> 00:09:58,973
George…

134
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,560
You don't want to sue Sam anymore?

135
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:07,607
That was before I had a miscarriage

136
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:13,070
but now I'm more determined
to put that woman in jail.

137
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,157
Good.

138
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:19,076
I will talk to my lawyers ASAP.

139
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:21,287
But, Sir Galvan, how can that be?

140
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:24,832
There is no evidence or witnesses.

141
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,960
I can produce witnesses.

142
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,883
We will lie in court, Dad?

143
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,179
If that's the only way to seek revenge

144
00:10:38,262 --> 00:10:40,765
for my grandson,

145
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:41,849
yes.

146
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,402
Dad, what you're thinking is dangerous.

147
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:59,241
Dangerous, but we can find a way.

148
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,374
It's Jericho…

149
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:08,292
Jericho can prove

150
00:11:08,376 --> 00:11:10,461
that no one saw what happened.

151
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,171
Because he saw
that it was only me and Sam there

152
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,756
when he and Bill arrived.

153
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:18,677
Well, you can probably convince Bill,

154
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,304
but Jericho…

155
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:24,392
I can make him agree.

156
00:11:27,812 --> 00:11:30,523
Even if you drive me away
and do not accept me,

157
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:32,108
I won't leave.

158
00:11:32,191 --> 00:11:34,693
I will protect my family.

159
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,322
Thank you…

160
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:43,369
and forgive me.

161
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,875
Welcome to the family,

162
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:52,253
to our family.

163
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:11,814
I know Jericho's weakness,

164
00:12:11,897 --> 00:12:13,899
and I will use that

165
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:15,860
so he'll be on our side.

166
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:18,654
What if he disagrees?

167
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,532
To tell you the truth,

168
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:25,870
the case is only my plan B.

169
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:27,496
I have a plan A.

170
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,914
What's that?

171
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,252
Actually, I don't know if he'll agree.

172
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,424
We talked about what happened to you

173
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:42,428
and I mentioned to him
that I want to avenge you.

174
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,140
He'll think about it.

175
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,734
Sofia, my child. Wake up.

176
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,029
We're leaving.

177
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,490
Call Cairo.

178
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,255
Be strong, George.

179
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:02,174
Yes, Dad.

180
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,719
Thank you so much, Sir Galvan.

181
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:16,689
Get well soon, George.

182
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:31,972
Help! Don't!

183
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,516
Don't! Help!

184
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,061
It's you.

185
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,520
Don't. Don't.

186
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,066
Don't.

187
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:48,697
You?

188
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,662
Why?

189
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,247
You killed George's baby.

190
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:58,791
You should die too.

191
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,554
Sam?

192
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,600
Sam…

193
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:25,401
No… No…

194
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:27,820
Sam…

195
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,782
Sam… Sam, wake up.

196
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,450
Wake up, Sam.

197
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,411
You're having a nightmare.

198
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,829
You're having a nightmare.

199
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,041
Mother.

200
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:43,293
It's just a dream.

201
00:16:43,377 --> 00:16:45,045
You're having a nightmare.

202
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,135
It's just a dream.

203
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,681
You're so careless, Amando.

204
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:58,934
You even wrote a love letter for me

205
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:02,396
and then you just let anyone read it.

206
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:04,940
I'm sorry.

207
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,028
I had no plans to spread it.

208
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:12,990
Now the entire compound
is talking about us.

209
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:15,576
You're so stupid. God!

210
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:17,745
Maybe…

211
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:21,373
it's better if I just push through
with my resignation,

212
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:22,833
so people will stop talking about us.

213
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,129
Oh, come on, Amando.
Don't try to be the hero.

214
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,341
That won't make you handsome.

215
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:34,803
What we need to do
is fire all the employees.

216
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,264
Replace all of them with new ones.

217
00:17:39,308 --> 00:17:44,021
Those who don't know
about the stench of our family.

218
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,317
Sam, what did you dream about?

219
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,903
You look so scared.
You were asking for help.

220
00:17:52,112 --> 00:17:53,989
It's Amando.

221
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,992
He was stabbing me in my dream.

222
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,205
Mother, he was the Palacios killer
in my dream.

223
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,291
And he sought revenge
on me because of George.

224
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,796
Mother, it felt so real.

225
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:10,506
I thought I was already dead

226
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,466
- in my dream.
- No.

227
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:13,926
That's just a dream.

228
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:17,096
Remember, we were talking
about him earlier.

229
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,061
Mother, I'm scared.

230
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:28,315
Do you want me to sleep with you
so your fear will go away?

231
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:36,031
Yes.

232
00:18:37,282 --> 00:18:39,243
Okay, I will talk to all
the staff tomorrow.

233
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,578
No.

234
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:46,250
Amando, talk to Sergeant Royales first.

235
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,546
You're now the new person of interest
for running over Francis.

236
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,257
And most likely for shooting Iñigo too.

237
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:57,344
I can get away with this, Madam.

238
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,638
If Sergeant Royales will talk to me again.

239
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,891
No, Amando. No.

240
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:07,396
Wait for my lawyer's call
before you do anything.

241
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,773
You might say something stupid again

242
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:11,483
and might involve me too.

243
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:16,071
You will say nothing without a lawyer

244
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:19,283
if he tries to talk
to you again, understood?

245
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:24,830
Now leave, Amando.

246
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:28,834
Thank you, Ma'am Aurora.

247
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:33,505
Despite my sins, you didn't neglect me.

248
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:37,885
Amando…

249
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:44,057
Don't put any malice with me helping you.

250
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:48,061
I'm doing this to save myself, not you.

251
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,066
And one more thing,

252
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,571
my father and your father ordered us…

253
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:03,035
to always watch each other's back.

254
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,870
I have no choice.

255
00:20:06,914 --> 00:20:08,665
I made a promise to Dad.

256
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,962
Now leave. Go.

257
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:31,164
Ward, prepare your sister's room.

258
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:36,378
George…

259
00:21:41,008 --> 00:21:43,969
Why? What's the problem?

260
00:21:46,221 --> 00:21:49,224
Mommy, do I still have a right
to live here?

261
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:53,228
Come on, George.
Why are you talking that way?

262
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,606
Mom, I am no longer carrying a Palacios.

263
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,277
You know, George…

264
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:02,904
you have a point.

265
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:07,075
I think there's no reason
for you to live in this house

266
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,037
because you're no longer
carrying a Palacios.

267
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,334
What's with you, Vivian?

268
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:17,336
Can you please stop?

269
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:21,131
George just got back
from the hospital, right?

270
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,633
That's right.

271
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,177
I'm sorry.

272
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:29,431
George, condolences.
I'm sorry for your loss.

273
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,977
Maybe it hurts a lot, right?

274
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,856
But like what Catriona Gray said,

275
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,484
there's always a silver lining,

276
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:42,986
So maybe it's just okay.

277
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:46,073
Is it okay to have a miscarriage,
Vivian? Is it really okay?

278
00:22:46,156 --> 00:22:48,658
Ruth, there you go again.
You're hotheaded again.

279
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,286
All I mean is

280
00:22:51,369 --> 00:22:54,831
maybe it's better that George's baby died

281
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:57,542
because at least
he wasn't yet fully developed.

282
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,336
George didn't have
any emotional attachment

283
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:01,129
to her baby, right?

284
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,298
What's with you? Stop stressing George.

285
00:23:03,381 --> 00:23:05,801
I'm not stressing George.

286
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,595
In fact, I'm trying to make her
feel better.

287
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,181
What I'm saying is,
it's better that her baby

288
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,557
wasn't old enough when he died.

289
00:23:12,641 --> 00:23:16,103
Look, what happened to Aurora

290
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,856
when Paco died was more painful.

291
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:22,192
That woman almost went crazy.

292
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:26,446
And Mercy when Francis died.

293
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,324
And even Galvan when Basil died.

294
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,076
He was so hurt, remember?

295
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,494
That's all I have to say.

296
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,371
Can you please stop pissing her off?

297
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,123
Whatever.

298
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:38,708
Okay, let's just go back
to what she was saying earlier.

299
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:42,963
You know George, I think…

300
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:47,717
you have no right
to stay here in this house

301
00:23:48,468 --> 00:23:51,263
because you're no longer
pregnant with a Palacios baby.

302
00:23:53,265 --> 00:23:55,308
Will you just stop, Vivian?
What's with you?

303
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,643
What is it again?

304
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:58,061
George had a miscarriage

305
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,146
and you are talking a lot of nonsense.

306
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:00,188
Why are you hurting me?

307
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,899
Why wouldn't I hurt you
when you're disrespecting my daughter?

308
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:03,817
What do you mean?

309
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,320
Has Sergeant Royales
already interviewed Amando?

310
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:09,114
Not yet.

311
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,826
I think we're wrong.

312
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:16,621
It seems it wasn't Sir Amando
who ran Francis over.

313
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:18,039
He has a strong alibi.

314
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,715
What now? You really won't stop.

315
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:30,177
What's with you? It's you. You.

316
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,555
It's you who started it.
My daughter had a miscarriage.

317
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,223
- What is it now?
- Oh my.

318
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,600
- Come on.
- Hey, Vivian!

319
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:37,809
What's this again?

320
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:41,313
Galvan, I'm not doing anything wrong.

321
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:44,065
It's them. I'm just welcoming them

322
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,775
because they just got back here,

323
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,902
and now I'm the bad one?

324
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,778
No. You're not welcoming us.

325
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:50,655
You just misinterpreted what I said.

326
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:51,948
- Hey, you! Hey!
- I was trying to be…

327
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,950
There, he told you to shut up.

328
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:54,868
- You're so annoying.
- Get out of here.

329
00:24:54,951 --> 00:24:56,494
- Get out of here.
- I don't have any…

330
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,330
- Just stay in the room.
- That's the problem.

331
00:24:58,413 --> 00:24:59,998
- I'm always at fault.
- Leave now.

332
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:01,875
They're always the good ones.

333
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:08,715
I'm sorry about Vivian.

334
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,092
We've been very patient
with her, Sir Galvan,

335
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,261
but she did go overboard.

336
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,471
She's too much.

337
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,682
I apologize for her.

338
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,563
George, what's wrong?

339
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,694
If it wasn't Amando
who ran Francis over, then who?

340
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,574
Maybe he ordered someone else,

341
00:25:35,158 --> 00:25:38,119
so that he could carry out
Mom Aurora's orders.

342
00:25:48,755 --> 00:25:50,215
Attorney Sulit.

343
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:53,760
We just came from the police station.

344
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,137
And as requested by Madam Aurora,

345
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:00,934
we have here a copy
of the joint affidavit of my clients,

346
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,562
Amando and Cairo.

347
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:11,152
On the night that Mr. Castillo
was run over,

348
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:15,615
they were together purchasing supplies…

349
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,867
for the house staff.

350
00:26:20,495 --> 00:26:23,957
Here's a copy of the receipt
from the Prince Supermart

351
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,792
where they went to shop

352
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:30,964
and the receipt of Sunscale gas station

353
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:35,176
with the same date and time stamps.

354
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,518
There's also a copy of CCTV footage

355
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:45,395
of the said establishments.

356
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,732
Here are other supporting documents

357
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:50,817
to support their alibis.

358
00:26:54,696 --> 00:26:59,409
And please, refrain from
making false accusations,

359
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,497
or else I will be compelled
to file a suit against you…

360
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,960
for slander and oral defamation.

361
00:27:17,844 --> 00:27:19,262
Tell me, George.

362
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,598
What's the problem?

363
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,100
Dad, since our last talk,

364
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:26,686
I've been thinking.

365
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:29,939
I don't belong here anymore.

366
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,941
That's why once I've recover,

367
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:35,028
I plan to leave this place.

368
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:38,365
What are you talking about?

369
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:39,949
No, George.

370
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,910
You don't have to leave.

371
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,119
Just stay here.

372
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:47,165
But, Dad. I'm already useless to you.

373
00:27:47,248 --> 00:27:49,959
I can no longer give you an heir.

374
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:53,254
I don't know what happened
to you after we talked.

375
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:55,840
But for me,

376
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:58,426
with or without a baby,

377
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,470
you're a Palacios.

378
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,722
You're like a daughter to me now.

379
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:08,311
But, Dad, it's embarrassing.

380
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:10,647
Come here.

381
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:31,793
We're back to zero again.

382
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,211
I thought we had a new lead

383
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:36,131
after seeing Amando's love letter.

384
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,306
George has been discharged
from the hospital.

385
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:46,891
They're already home.

386
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:51,521
- Wait.
- Sam, where are you going?

387
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,898
Mother, I'll go to George.
I'll check on her.

388
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:56,609
But didn't she try to kill you?

389
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,572
Mother, she was mad at that time.
Her baby had just died.

390
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:02,115
But maybe things are different now.

391
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:04,701
- Sam…
- Don't worry about me, Mom.

392
00:29:04,784 --> 00:29:06,828
I'll be careful. Don't worry.

393
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:10,039
- Jericho, go with her.
- No, no need.

394
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:13,334
We need to talk just the two of us.

395
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,599
So, how do you like my dress?

396
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,976
Do I look slim?

397
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:30,894
Why are you wearing red?

398
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:32,312
Why are you wearing red?

399
00:29:32,395 --> 00:29:35,148
- Where's the party?
- There's no party.

400
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,733
I'm preparing

401
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:42,113
just in case there's a memorial
for George's baby.

402
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,491
Really, Mom? Red?

403
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,995
That's so disrespectful.

404
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,664
People will be looking at you.

405
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,125
Is that so?

406
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:56,753
Well then…

407
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:59,964
Let's push this outfit.

408
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:04,177
So, red it is. Perfect.

409
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:07,722
Mom…

410
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,184
Are you happy about
what happened to George's baby?

411
00:30:57,981 --> 00:30:59,107
George…

412
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,405
You really won't leave me in peace?

413
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:11,286
Of course not.

414
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,622
Why would I be happy?
How would I benefit from that?

415
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:22,005
But yes, I want to piss them off
with this red dress.

416
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,759
I'm annoyed with your daddy.

417
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,971
Can you see what he's doing lately?

418
00:31:30,054 --> 00:31:31,639
He is so close to George.

419
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,684
He even has this drama…

420
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:37,437
"Oh, George is like a daughter to me."

421
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,439
But it's true, Mom.

422
00:31:39,522 --> 00:31:42,692
George became a Palacios
by virtue of marriage.

423
00:31:43,651 --> 00:31:44,944
Even if Basil is gone,

424
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:46,738
the relationship stays.

425
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:49,616
No, Sofia. That's not right.

426
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:54,495
You're the only real child of Galvan

427
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,289
who is alive,

428
00:31:56,372 --> 00:32:00,084
so that's why all your daddy's attention
must go only to you.

429
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,002
No one else.

430
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:04,005
I have no problem sharing
my father with anyone.

431
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:06,174
So, why is it a big deal with you?

432
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:14,974
Because what I want is…

433
00:32:16,142 --> 00:32:19,479
for everything that the Palacios have

434
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:21,522
to go to you.

435
00:32:22,398 --> 00:32:27,570
You're the only one
who should be the heir, Sofia.

436
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:32,116
Whatever or whoever stands in the way…

437
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,661
must be gone.

438
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,207
Mom…

439
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,919
Are you involved in all the killings

440
00:32:43,002 --> 00:32:44,295
that are happening in our family?

441
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,007
You want to eradicate everyone else,

442
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:50,051
so that I will be the only one left?

443
00:32:57,392 --> 00:32:58,977
What the hell, Samantha?

444
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,063
What else do you need from me?

445
00:33:03,439 --> 00:33:06,025
George, I only want us to patch things up.

446
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:12,073
No, because you don't exist to me anymore.

447
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,868
George even if
you drive me away every day,

448
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,038
I will still apologize to you every day.

449
00:33:19,122 --> 00:33:21,958
I will still beg you every day.

450
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,168
Well, then I will still drive
you away every day.

451
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:28,256
I will never forgive you

452
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:31,884
because what you did to me
and my baby is unforgivable.

453
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,099
Tell me, Mommy. Are you behind
all of the killings?

454
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:42,145
What happened to Francis, to Iñigo,

455
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:44,397
and even framing Ward. Did you do that?

456
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,606
Are you the mastermind?

457
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,734
Are you accusing me?

458
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,027
Is that what you're trying to say?

459
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:51,154
No, Sofia.

460
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:52,947
I couldn't do that.

461
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:55,908
Sofia…

462
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:02,165
The universe unfolds as it should.

463
00:34:03,541 --> 00:34:05,168
That means

464
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,087
everything that's supposed to happen

465
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,758
will happen even if
I'm not doing anything.

466
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:13,259
Just like right now.

467
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:17,305
Everything that's happening
happens to be in my favor.

468
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,681
I mean in our favor.

469
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:24,854
I have to take this call.
We're not done talking.

470
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:27,565
Hello?

471
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:40,119
Come on, baby.

472
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,664
Let's go out and play.

473
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:47,001
Hey, what would it be? What would it be?

474
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:52,840
There. You're the lucky one.

475
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,175
Come on.

476
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:59,222
Oh my… Oh, my god.

477
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:03,976
Oh, my god.

478
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:26,040
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.

479
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:48,729
Oh, my god.

480
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,579
Oh, my god.
Good thing Sofia didn't see it.

481
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:16,507
George, I will do anything,
just forgive me.

482
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,843
I will do anything.

483
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,262
Really, Samantha?

484
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,640
You will do anything
for me to forgive you?

485
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:27,059
Yes, I will do anything.

486
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:33,024
Okay, I will forgive you…

487
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,818
on one condition.

488
00:36:37,403 --> 00:36:38,946
Anything.

489
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:42,325
You will give me your baby.

490
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:46,913
What?

491
00:36:57,632 --> 00:36:58,591
Mommy?

492
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:02,011
Mom.

493
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,097
Wait. Wait. Wait a second.

494
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:09,435
Why did you lock it?

495
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,562
Lock? What are you talking about?

496
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:14,315
It was you who went out.
I didn't go near the door.

497
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:16,734
- Maybe you locked it.
- Tell me, Mom.

498
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,611
Are you the killer?

499
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,821
Are you the mastermind?

500
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,793
Sofia, you're hurting my feelings.

501
00:37:42,718 --> 00:37:45,221
Is that really how you see me?

502
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:51,185
I am your mother, Sofia.

503
00:37:53,104 --> 00:37:56,315
Do you think your mother is that evil?

504
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,946
I'm a gold digger, Sofia.

505
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:04,323
A gold digger.

506
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:09,287
Yes, because I want a good life.

507
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:12,748
Not only for me, but also for my child

508
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,709
and it turns out that's you.

509
00:38:15,376 --> 00:38:17,503
And when I met Galvan,

510
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,382
I seduced him, yes.

511
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:27,138
I really seduced Galvan,
but eventually, I fell in love with him.

512
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,765
I genuinely loved him.

513
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:36,522
Yes, that's why I'm only a gold digger,
Sofia, but I am not a killer.

514
00:38:37,064 --> 00:38:39,942
I couldn't do the things
you are accusing me of.

515
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:43,988
I am not the Palacios killer.
I am not a murderer!

516
00:38:44,071 --> 00:38:47,116
I am not a murderer.

517
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:50,328
I couldn't do that.

518
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:56,459
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on, please.

519
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:13,976
George, I won't deprive you of my baby.

520
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:18,356
We will raise him together.
Remember before,

521
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:24,028
we promised each other that we would be
godmothers to each other's children.

522
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:28,616
George, you will be
the second mom of my baby.

523
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:31,118
No, Sam.

524
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:35,373
I want to be your baby's only mommy.

525
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:40,836
What I want is for you
to give him to me for adoption…

526
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:47,593
as a replacement for the baby
that I lost because of you.

527
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,137
George…

528
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,559
Are you crazy?

529
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,062
George, that's not possible.

530
00:39:58,646 --> 00:40:03,067
Well, in that case…
we have nothing to talk about.

531
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:07,863
That's my condition
if you want me to forgive you.

532
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,449
Your child is mine.

533
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,910
Take it or leave it.

534
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,136
Have you thought about it?

535
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,767
I don't think I can do it, Sir Galvan.

536
00:40:39,395 --> 00:40:41,605
I think you're just asking
for a higher price.

537
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,357
Fine.

538
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:46,360
Ten million pesos.

539
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:50,239
What kind of revenge do you want?

540
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:53,075
I can't kill a human being.

541
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,745
You will not kill Sam.

542
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:00,833
All I want is for her to be disabled.

543
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,502
Cripple her, just like
what happened to me.

544
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,800
That's your plan A, Dad?

545
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,606
She can only forgive me
if I give her my baby.

546
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:27,735
No one can get your baby.
No one can get my grandchild.

547
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,777
Except you?

548
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:32,114
She killed your baby, my grandchild.

549
00:41:32,198 --> 00:41:34,241
I don't want to see her happy
giving birth to her baby.

550
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:36,327
Not with the plan I have in mind.

551
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,287
She will be grieving.

552
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:41,332
We will steal her baby.
