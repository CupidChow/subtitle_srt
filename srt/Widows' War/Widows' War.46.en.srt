1
00:00:13,888 --> 00:00:15,390
Iñigo is my friend.

2
00:00:15,473 --> 00:00:16,891
He's my husband's best friend.

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,309
But, Uncle Galvan doesn't like him.

4
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:20,729
Don't you think
that there's a possible reason

5
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:23,440
why Uncle doesn't want you
to be near that guy?

6
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:25,024
The suspect has an accomplice.

7
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,735
Do they know who the accomplice is?

8
00:00:26,818 --> 00:00:28,862
The taxi driver dropped
the suspect off over there.

9
00:00:29,821 --> 00:00:30,947
Juliet Gamboa.

10
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:33,324
PREVIOUSLY

11
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:34,951
Juliet Gamboa, you're under arrest.

12
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,870
<i>I want to know the truth.</i>

13
00:00:36,953 --> 00:00:39,330
Days before he committed suicide,
I bumped into him.

14
00:00:39,414 --> 00:00:41,374
<i>I remember that was March 10.</i>

15
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:42,292
Who did this to you?

16
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:44,461
It's Paco, he ran me over.

17
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,712
Help me escape from here.

18
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:46,921
He will kill me.

19
00:00:47,005 --> 00:00:49,966
Paco didn't succeed in killing my father.

20
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,259
That's why she helped him.

21
00:00:51,342 --> 00:00:52,218
<i>It says here,</i>

22
00:00:52,302 --> 00:00:55,096
he went to Hong Kong on March 11

23
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,098
and came back on March 20.

24
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,642
So, it means he wasn't here when Dad died.

25
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,686
I know you're not alone.
Who is your accomplice?

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,772
The suspect who killed Beverly
has been caught already.

27
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,356
I hope she will admit everything,

28
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,192
including who her accomplice is.

29
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:08,860
- It's the attorney.
- Attorney?

30
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:09,861
It's Iñigo.

31
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:12,614
He ordered me to kill Beverly.

32
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:15,617
And he also killed Peter Pambid.

33
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:17,869
<i>It wasn't Paco who killed my father</i>

34
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:19,537
because he wasn't here when it happened.

35
00:01:19,621 --> 00:01:21,706
But, you. You were here.

36
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,209
Was it you who killed my father

37
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:25,794
so he wouldn't come back to us?

38
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,216
You have brains, Sam.

39
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,175
Use them.

40
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:36,304
Just because your father said
to wait for his return,

41
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:39,015
doesn't mean he's going back
to your family.

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,894
That's not the only thing I found.

43
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:53,780
These are four tickets to Singapore…

44
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,744
dated September 12, 2019.

45
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:02,705
One for me, for Francis,

46
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:06,876
for Mother, and for Dad.

47
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:10,171
For his wedding anniversary with Mother.

48
00:02:11,005 --> 00:02:14,384
Dad made a promise before
that on their 30th wedding anniversary,

49
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:16,511
they would go back to Singapore

50
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:19,139
because that's where they went
for their honeymoon.

51
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,017
He was planning to fulfill
his promise to my mother

52
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,354
because he chose Mother.

53
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,314
He chose to come back to us.

54
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:30,441
That's not true.

55
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:33,153
Orly already said goodbye to Mercy.

56
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,947
Maybe he changed his mind.

57
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,783
Maybe he realized

58
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,453
that he can't live with someone like you.

59
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:45,456
Like me what?

60
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:50,295
Ruthless, manipulative, narcissistic.

61
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,131
And being the narcissist that you are,

62
00:02:53,214 --> 00:02:56,009
you chose to kill my father

63
00:02:56,092 --> 00:02:57,719
rather than let him come back to us.

64
00:02:59,178 --> 00:03:00,346
No.

65
00:03:10,064 --> 00:03:12,817
I kept my anger for five years.

66
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:16,487
I almost cursed you.

67
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,199
But, it turns out…

68
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,911
you were coming back to us.

69
00:03:23,912 --> 00:03:27,707
If Sam and Francis hadn't see your gift,

70
00:03:28,917 --> 00:03:30,501
until now,

71
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,713
there would still be anger in my heart.

72
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,805
What are you doing here?

73
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:46,809
Mercy…

74
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,274
Mercy, I'm sorry.

75
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:58,279
I'm sorry that Ruth and I taunted you.

76
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,784
Actually, it was Ruth's fault.

77
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,078
She just pushed me.

78
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:07,872
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

79
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,250
Let's make peace, okay?

80
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,461
Anyways…

81
00:04:16,673 --> 00:04:18,007
Mercy…

82
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,722
Is it true that Dr. Orly was
supposed to come back to you?

83
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,062
You're something else, girl.

84
00:04:31,145 --> 00:04:36,150
He chose you over that flirt.

85
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,282
But, why did he commit suicide?

86
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,910
He didn't commit suicide.

87
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,578
He was killed.

88
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:49,580
I am sure that he was killed.

89
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,501
Damn you, Sam.

90
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,130
I didn't kill Orly.

91
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,632
I loved him and he loved me.

92
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,592
You were just a mistress, his pastime.

93
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:03,678
I was not just a pastime.

94
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,179
You were still a mistress.

95
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:08,975
A <i>querida,</i> weekend hobby, mistress,

96
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:11,394
third party. you're a flirt.

97
00:05:11,477 --> 00:05:12,729
You fool.

98
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:14,689
Ma'am Aurora. Ma'am.

99
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,066
Calm down, ma'am.

100
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,904
Don't stop me, Amando.

101
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,160
I'm sick and tired
of this freaking drama queen.

102
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:28,703
Go ahead. Don't stop her.

103
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:31,247
Kill me just like you killed Dad.

104
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,749
Stop accusing.

105
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,294
It was not Ma'am Aurora
who killed Dr. Orly.

106
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:39,797
So, someone killed my dad?

107
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:41,924
Yes.

108
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,010
Who?

109
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,888
Who, Amando? Who?

110
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,684
That hurts, Mercy.

111
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,521
Okay, go ahead.
If he was killed, then he was killed.

112
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:58,357
Well, I'm sorry.

113
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,569
You know, the truth is,

114
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,783
I don't believe
that Dr. Orly committed suicide.

115
00:06:07,825 --> 00:06:10,286
Because based on what Galvan told me,

116
00:06:10,787 --> 00:06:13,164
your husband was a very good person.

117
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:19,420
That's why I think,
he was really killed by…

118
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,590
Who?

119
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:25,635
Who, Vivian? Do you know something?

120
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,472
Come on, Mercy.

121
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,518
If a married man has a mistress

122
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:36,938
and suddenly dies,

123
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,857
who is the first suspect?

124
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:42,401
It's the wife, right?

125
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:46,614
But, if the wife didn't do about it,
then who's the next suspect?

126
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:50,159
Of course, it's the mistress.

127
00:06:51,202 --> 00:06:54,080
That's why you know,

128
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:56,541
that half-baked sister-in-law
of mine is really a demon.

129
00:06:56,624 --> 00:06:58,334
She's a crazy demon.

130
00:06:58,918 --> 00:07:01,212
Imagine what she did to you.

131
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:05,758
She stole the person
you loved most in your life.

132
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,928
And then what? Just like that?

133
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,724
That's why if I were you,
I wouldn't allow it.

134
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,144
She should pay for it.

135
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,485
Why?

136
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,321
Do you think I'm allowing it?

137
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:30,658
We're just looking for evidence.

138
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:32,201
We'll have her jailed.

139
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:37,373
Mercy, that was five years ago.

140
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,376
Whatever evidence you're talking about,

141
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,088
for sure they have disposed
of it already, knowing Aurora.

142
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:46,132
Or, maybe she included that in the fire.

143
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,346
That half-baked sister-in-law
of mine is really a demon.

144
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:54,390
Mercy…

145
00:07:55,183 --> 00:07:58,936
Your in-law has committed
a huge sin against you.

146
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,565
She didn't only steal your husband,
she also killed him.

147
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:06,277
That's why she has to pay, Mercy.

148
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:09,113
That's why if I were you,

149
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,991
seek revenge.

150
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,203
Confront that Aurora.

151
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,955
Drag her,

152
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,667
pull her hair until she becomes bald.

153
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:25,213
That's what she deserves.
She stole your husband

154
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:29,926
Answer me. Who killed my father?

155
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,135
Himself.

156
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,513
Your father killed himself.

157
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:36,432
That's not true.
My father didn't commit suicide.

158
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,558
Yes.

159
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,353
He overdosed on heroin. He killed himself.

160
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,855
- He committed suicide.
- No. No.

161
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,607
Why is there a suicide note?

162
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,402
When we got to his apartment,

163
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:51,489
we found Dr. Orly lifeless.

164
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,824
And we also saw this, ma'am.

165
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:03,084
This is my father's handwriting.

166
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,047
That was fake. They faked his penmanship.

167
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,757
That's enough, Sam.

168
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,425
Stop accusing.

169
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,012
There's no other reason why Dr. Orly died,

170
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,558
but himself.

171
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:21,686
I know you're just covering up
for this woman.

172
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,440
I know in my heart
that it was you who killed my father.

173
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,442
I will look for evidence.

174
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:30,736
I will put you behind bars.

175
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:10,067
Amando, who is in charge
of the investigation?

176
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,944
It's Sergeant Reynaldo, ma'am.

177
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,954
Arthur…

178
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:26,959
You're the one handling
the Dr. Castillo case.

179
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:30,963
Good, good.

180
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:33,466
Come here and we'll talk.

181
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,844
And bring your wife.

182
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:40,139
Is she fond of gold jewelry?

183
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,398
I told him, Amando,

184
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,109
not to leave me, right?

185
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,489
If you only listened to me, Orly…

186
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:00,034
Orly.

187
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,786
Orly, wait.

188
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:03,162
- Orly!
- What?

189
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:06,666
Please, I'm sorry.

190
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,417
It's just…

191
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,921
Paco will never accept you.

192
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,923
He will hate me to death.

193
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,802
Why don't we do this?

194
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,346
Let's continue our relationship,

195
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,766
but we can't let Paco know.

196
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,644
And be your kept man forever?

197
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,105
No, Aurora.

198
00:11:29,772 --> 00:11:32,900
I'm a jerk. I'm so stupid.

199
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,985
Why did I choose you?

200
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,613
I left my family just for you.

201
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,907
Calm down. Orly, please.

202
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,825
No.

203
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:42,993
Let's end this, for good.

204
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:45,246
I will go back to my family.

205
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:47,915
And you will never see me again.

206
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,667
What?

207
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:51,293
No.

208
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,671
Try and leave me.

209
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:56,090
I will kill you.

210
00:11:57,341 --> 00:12:01,554
Do you think I'm scared of your threats?

211
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:33,794
Amando…

212
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,048
Fix me another glass of wine, please.

213
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:55,774
Attorney Iñigo contacted me last 2019.

214
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,027
It was the month of October.

215
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,779
I thought

216
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,532
he was a lawyer who would help
in my mother's case.

217
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:06,660
But, it turns out,

218
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:09,079
he wanted to seek revenge
on the Palacioses.

219
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,459
His family was a victim
of those monsters too.

220
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,758
Did you investigate him already?

221
00:13:21,634 --> 00:13:23,802
I made a profile
of everyone who is connected

222
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:24,845
to the Palacioses.

223
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,141
You know that.
You're a former police officer.

224
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:34,522
You won't find any connection

225
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:38,192
between Iñigo Morales' family
and the Palacioses

226
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,070
Because he is not Iñigo Morales.

227
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,696
His real name is…

228
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,949
Antonio Beringuela.

229
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,288
What's wrong?

230
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,419
I'm just worried.

231
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:01,632
If that Juliet has an accomplice,

232
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,261
I'm sure he'll get back
at the Palacioses, especially you.

233
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,555
She already made an attempt on your life.

234
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,474
Iñigo, don't worry about me.

235
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:11,725
I'm safe.

236
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,769
Bill is keeping a tight guard on me.

237
00:14:13,852 --> 00:14:15,854
But, you're safer with me.

238
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,773
Why don't you come with me?

239
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,111
You, Auntie Ruth, and Ward.

240
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:24,655
Let's go to a faraway place.

241
00:14:25,739 --> 00:14:27,283
I can provide for your family.

242
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,159
What?

243
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,162
The son of José Beringuela

244
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:36,125
who Palacios siblings betrayed
and had him jailed.

245
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:38,460
His father died in jail

246
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:43,090
and his mother died soon after
due to a heart attack.

247
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,635
Antonio was orphaned at a young age.

248
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,179
What happened to the young Antonio?

249
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:54,393
His godmother, Almira Morales,
took him in.

250
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:58,772
And she changed his name
to her deceased son,

251
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,442
Iñigo Morales.

252
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,238
It's for your safety.

253
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,408
You and your baby.

254
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:13,787
George, I want to protect you…

255
00:15:15,748 --> 00:15:17,291
because I love you.

256
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,205
I've been keeping this
for quite some time now.

257
00:15:57,081 --> 00:15:58,999
I was just waiting for the right time

258
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:02,586
to give this to you.

259
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,763
Yes, call the civil registry.

260
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:15,224
Ask about Antonio Beringuela.

261
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,184
Don't bother.

262
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,938
His godmother fixed that already.

263
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:23,232
You won't see anything.

264
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:25,609
The only thing you will see

265
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,487
is Antonio Beringuela's death certificate.

266
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:30,781
But, the truth is,

267
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:35,202
he is now known
to everyone as Attorney Iñigo Morales.

268
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:38,163
Iñigo, I can't accept that.

269
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,000
We already talked, remember?

270
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,626
I'm not yet ready.

271
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:44,712
I know.

272
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,381
I understand.

273
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,591
I can wait.

274
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,721
But, come with me first…

275
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:58,058
until we're 100 percent sure
that you're already safe here.

276
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:00,394
I have a rest house.

277
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:02,896
We can hide there first.

278
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:06,316
No one knows that place.

279
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:26,628
So, George…

280
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,798
What's your decision?

281
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:36,055
I mean, with my offer
to go to a faraway place.

282
00:17:38,182 --> 00:17:40,017
To be honest I'm also scared.

283
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,395
I've been attacked twice.

284
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,153
Don't come near me…

285
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:52,613
Don't come near me.

286
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,449
So, I'm considering your offer.

287
00:17:57,618 --> 00:17:59,912
For me and my baby's safety.
And for my family too.

288
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,873
George, don't just consider it.

289
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:04,833
Do it.

290
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:09,254
Pack your things tomorrow.

291
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,634
Because when I get discharged,
we're leaving soon after.

292
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:15,636
Tomorrow? That soon?

293
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:17,429
George, we need to hurry.

294
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:19,306
Your life is in danger.

295
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,351
Let's just sleep on it tonight.

296
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:25,354
Tomorrow let's see each other.

297
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:29,566
Let's talk about it and plan it properly.

298
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,530
But, George…

299
00:18:35,906 --> 00:18:37,533
I hope you can decide right away…

300
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,618
for your baby's sake.

301
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:47,084
I can't just rely on your words.

302
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,836
I need to verify it.

303
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,337
I know…

304
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,131
but you can do that later.

305
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:55,801
Don't waste time. You should catch Iñigo.

306
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:58,262
Based on your statement?

307
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,516
I have solid evidence of our connivance

308
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,601
in killing the Palacioses.

309
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,104
Sam.

310
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,611
What are you doing here?

311
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,241
What, Sam?

312
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,618
Why are you here?

313
00:20:44,701 --> 00:20:45,661
What are you doing?

314
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:53,168
I'm looking for evidence against your boss

315
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,128
just like I said.

316
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:57,339
That's enough.

317
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,299
- Let's go outside.
- What if I refuse?

318
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,343
What will you do?

319
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,056
I will call the police.

320
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,808
For what?

321
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,601
Trespassing?

322
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,187
Maybe you've forgotten,

323
00:21:12,854 --> 00:21:15,107
I am a Palacios.

324
00:21:15,190 --> 00:21:16,817
If you think about it,

325
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,237
I have more rights than you.

326
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:24,199
What? Do you have anything else to say?

327
00:21:36,545 --> 00:21:37,921
That soon?

328
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,425
Iñigo wants us to leave that soon?

329
00:21:42,342 --> 00:21:43,677
Yes, Mom.

330
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,179
It's a bit weird
because he's in such a hurry.

331
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:48,181
It's like he wants to escape
from something.

332
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:50,517
He really wants to escape from someone.

333
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,768
It's that Juliet

334
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,771
and whoever is the accomplice
of that Palacios killer.

335
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,231
Maybe so, Mother.

336
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,984
He was so traumatized
after getting stabbed.

337
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:03,947
He's so worried about you,
he even gave that to you.

338
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,951
That looks expensive.

339
00:22:08,994 --> 00:22:12,456
And it looks like Iñigo loves you.

340
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:16,501
How about you?
Is your heart starting to beat?

341
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:19,629
Mom, Basil just died.

342
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:22,132
I'm not ready to love someone else.

343
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:25,802
Is Iñigo courting you?

344
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:40,984
Francis…

345
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,447
I really can't find evidence
against Mom Aurora.

346
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:48,200
I have checked all the rooms
here in this house.

347
00:22:51,411 --> 00:22:52,370
Francis?

348
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,168
Are you okay?

349
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,005
Francis, is there a problem?

350
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,885
What happened to you?
Why do you look that way?

351
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:12,432
Dad…

352
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,643
I knew it.

353
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,479
That jerk is seduces you.

354
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:20,482
Sir Galvan, I don't think
there's something wrong

355
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:22,067
if Iñigo courts her.

356
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,528
Basil is already dead.

357
00:23:24,611 --> 00:23:26,196
But, no offense meant, Sir Galvan.

358
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,659
George is not ready yet.
They're just friends.

359
00:23:31,576 --> 00:23:34,704
Dad, I'm not even sure
if I'll answer him or what.

360
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:37,499
I don't feel anything for him.

361
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:38,416
Mom is right.

362
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,377
I just see him as a friend.

363
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,503
None yet.

364
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:45,423
But, that fool will do everything
to make you fall in love with him.

365
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:48,301
Look, George.

366
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,804
There's no problem if someone courts you.

367
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,265
Basil is gone.

368
00:23:54,057 --> 00:23:55,392
That's your life.

369
00:23:56,059 --> 00:23:58,436
But, not Iñigo.

370
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,357
Dad, what's the problem
with the both of you?

371
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,067
If it's just business gone wrong…

372
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:07,028
Just obey me, George.

373
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:09,072
Blindly?

374
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,782
No.

375
00:24:10,866 --> 00:24:13,577
How can I follow you
if I don't know your reason,

376
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,953
or if it's even valid?

377
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:17,164
Iñigo is gay.

378
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,425
I went to the doctor.

379
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,429
What did he say?

380
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:40,228
The chemotherapy worked.

381
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,315
They don't see any cancer signs in me.

382
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:45,859
There's nothing.

383
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,320
Really?

384
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,365
Oh my God. Thank God.

385
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,451
Thank God.

386
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,875
You're annoying.

387
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:04,085
I thought it was bad news.

388
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:06,338
Thank God.

389
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:08,632
What else did he say?

390
00:25:08,715 --> 00:25:10,926
That's all, Sam. And I don't
need morphine anymore.

391
00:25:11,009 --> 00:25:11,843
Just tramadol.

392
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:18,225
Francis doesn't need you anymore.

393
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,643
He doesn't need you anymore.

394
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,610
For sure, Mother, will be happy
if she finds out.

395
00:25:31,863 --> 00:25:33,031
She still doesn't know?

396
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,699
I thought you went together
to the hospital?

397
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,993
What? I thought you were together.

398
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:39,579
Where is Mother?

399
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,709
What?

400
00:25:44,793 --> 00:25:46,628
He seduced Basil.

401
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,464
George…

402
00:25:49,547 --> 00:25:51,383
Just accept the reality.

403
00:25:51,466 --> 00:25:52,342
Vivian, shut up.

404
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,641
Why do men give flowers?

405
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,393
To show their appreciation.

406
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:04,646
It's enough for me
that you became a good friend.

407
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:08,149
But, what if I want us
to be more than friends?

408
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,446
I've been keeping this
for quite some time now.

409
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,282
I was just waiting for the right time

410
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:17,200
to give this to you.

411
00:26:17,784 --> 00:26:20,078
Dad, Basil and Iñigo are not gay.

412
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:24,249
Basil is not gay. But Iñigo is.

413
00:26:24,332 --> 00:26:27,210
He succeeded in seducing my son.

414
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:28,878
That's why Basil fell for him.

415
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:30,755
No, Dad.

416
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,424
You're just making this up.

417
00:26:32,507 --> 00:26:34,718
I wish I were, George, but I am not.

418
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:38,805
That Iñigo fooled your husband.

419
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:40,890
He extorted money from Basil.

420
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,518
It's a good thing
I was able to separate them.

421
00:26:43,601 --> 00:26:44,894
Because if not,

422
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:49,399
that Iñigo would've gotten
all of Basil's money.

423
00:26:50,608 --> 00:26:52,569
That's why you should listen to me.

424
00:26:52,652 --> 00:26:55,280
Stay away from him. He does not love you.

425
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,491
He just wants extort money
from you and you will get hurt.

426
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,411
Believe it or not, George.

427
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,538
I don't want you to get hurt.

428
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,374
Vivian.

429
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:10,795
I told you so.

430
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,278
Who is making me fuming mad, Barry?

431
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,196
<i>Your daughter-in-law?</i>

432
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,824
Daughter-in-law from hell, yes.

433
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,409
<i>What has she done now?</i>

434
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:46,748
She's looking for evidence
of her father's death

435
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,542
against me, Barry.

436
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:52,796
She insists that I killed Orly.

437
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,339
<i>Isn't that right?</i>

438
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:55,840
Barry.

439
00:27:57,300 --> 00:27:58,635
<i>Chill.</i>

440
00:27:58,718 --> 00:28:00,887
<i>Will she find evidence</i>

441
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:03,306
<i>if everything was cleaned already?</i>

442
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,266
<i>The subscriber cannot be reached.</i>

443
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,185
Nothing. Mother's phone can't be reached.

444
00:28:07,977 --> 00:28:11,481
I'm sure she's not in her room.
I was there earlier.

445
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,904
Where is Mother?

446
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,412
Mark my words, Barry.

447
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,039
Once Sam gives birth

448
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:31,751
and I get my grandchild,
I will get rid of her.

449
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:34,212
<i>It's very you, Aurora.</i>

450
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,465
I'm serious.

451
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:42,971
Also, stop sending me pictures of the kid.

452
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,140
She's now yours, Barry.

453
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:48,685
Okay.

454
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,520
Bye-bye.

455
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:54,607
You're a devil.

456
00:28:56,484 --> 00:28:57,402
Animal.

457
00:28:57,485 --> 00:28:58,737
What's with you, Mercy?

458
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:01,364
This is for what you did
to me and my children.

459
00:29:01,448 --> 00:29:02,741
What's with you?

460
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,659
- Animal.
- Let go of me.

461
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:09,539
You old prune.

462
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,833
Face me.

463
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:14,544
Sam, this is Sir Galvan's house.

464
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:18,631
Mother has nowhere else to go.
Maybe she's just here.

465
00:29:20,258 --> 00:29:22,093
Iñigo, are you still there?

466
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:25,221
Good. I'm on my way there.

467
00:29:25,305 --> 00:29:26,890
There's something you need
to explain to me.

468
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,105
What are you looking at?

469
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:37,066
Don't be too assuming.
I'm not looking at you.

470
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,693
We're looking for someone.

471
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:42,071
And if you don't want
to be looked at, don't stand in the way.

472
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,907
George.

473
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,286
You took the keys from Bill.

474
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:49,746
Where are you going?

475
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:52,248
Dad, I just need to buy something.

476
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:54,417
Without him?

477
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,378
Tell me the truth. Where are you going?

478
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:04,177
How about you?
Do you know where George is going?

479
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,810
I don't know.

480
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:14,562
But, I heard her talking
to Iñigo over the phone.

481
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:16,940
You're really disobeying me, George.

482
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,525
Bill.

483
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,902
Keep an eye on George.

484
00:30:20,985 --> 00:30:22,904
Don't let her go out.

485
00:30:25,073 --> 00:30:27,450
Dad, I just need to talk to Iñigo.

486
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,744
You have nothing more to talk about.

487
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,121
I already told you
everything you need to know

488
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,748
about that man.

489
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:35,583
You're not leaving.

490
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,675
You're a demon. Animal.

491
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,426
You took my children's father
away from them.

492
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,053
Let go of me.

493
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:48,638
You say I'm a demon?

494
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,432
Fine, I will show you my demonic side.

495
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:54,602
I will not back down from you,
a mistress who's a murderer.

496
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,647
Ouch.

497
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,606
You're just like your daughter.

498
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,277
You're full of accusations,
but you don't have evidence.

499
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,153
I don't need evidence.

500
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,656
I will get justice for my husband's death.

501
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:09,409
I will personally seek justice.

502
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,333
You fool.

503
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,252
- What now? Come on.
- George. George.

504
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,837
Cairo, let go of me.
Let me just hurt her once.

505
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,380
- I only said the truth.
- Let go of me, Cairo.

506
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:23,840
- Why are you so mad?
- George. Sam.

507
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,426
- Stop it.
- George, enough.

508
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:27,802
I said stop it.

509
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,263
- Ma'am Sam. Ma'am Sam.
- I will get back at you.

510
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:32,515
Ma'am Sam, Ma'am Aurora and Ma'am Mercy

511
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,142
are fighting in the other house.

512
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:35,643
What? Sam, let's go.

513
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:37,145
- What?
- Come on.

514
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,282
Mercy, what's with you? Let me go.

515
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:51,159
Stop bothering me.

516
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,496
You really don't want to stop?

517
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:59,167
Stop picking on me.

518
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:00,960
Mercy, come on.

519
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,558
I said let go of me.

520
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:18,227
No, I won't let go of you.

521
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,147
- Oh, my God.
- There they are, Ma'am Sam.

522
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:24,150
- What are you doing to Mercy, Aurora?
- There they are.

523
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,902
- Mother. Mother.
- Mother.

524
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,737
Come here. What now, Mercy?

525
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:30,156
Can you see the demon
that you're talking about?

526
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:33,117
- Let go of me.
- Ma'am Aurora.

527
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:38,414
Mother.

528
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:39,457
- Aurora.
- Ma'am.

529
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,793
Amado, let go of me.

530
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:45,213
I'm not yet done with that woman.

531
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:47,715
- Come here! What?
- Stop it.

532
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,927
Aurora, stop it.

533
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:52,679
What?

534
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:54,514
What are you looking at?

535
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:57,183
- You're a devil. An animal.
- Come here.

536
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:00,103
- You're so shameless.
- Go ahead.

537
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:03,272
Just kill each other. Go.

538
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:06,150
So my daughter will be
the only Palacios left.

539
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,655
George…

540
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:12,740
Please answer the phone.

541
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,183
Sergeant Royales.

542
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:42,812
What's the matter?

543
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:46,274
Since you're up for discharge,
come with us to the police station.

544
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,027
What's this all about?

545
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,903
Juliet Gambao identified you
as her accomplice.

546
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:55,616
Accomplice in the Palacios killings.

547
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,120
You're an animal.

548
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,041
- Mother. Sam.
- You'll kill my mother, too?

549
00:34:03,124 --> 00:34:04,876
I will kill you first.

550
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:05,877
- Sam.
- Sam.

551
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,628
- You're so shameless…
- I am not an accomplice

552
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,422
of that Palacios killer.

553
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:10,965
Just explain at the police station.

554
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:13,593
I know my rights.

555
00:34:14,093 --> 00:34:15,803
You can't just force me to go with you.

556
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:19,057
We have evidence against you.

557
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,308
Show him.

558
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,687
<i>How did you kill Peter?</i>

559
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:27,815
<i>I hit him with a baseball bat in the face.</i>

560
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:31,861
<i>I broke his head.</i>

561
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:37,575
That's just one
of the video recordings Juliet took.

562
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:41,204
Video recordings without my consent…

563
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,707
That's a violation of my privacy rights

564
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,626
and the anti-wiretapping law.

565
00:34:46,709 --> 00:34:49,087
But this is a serious crime,
Attorney Morales.

566
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,339
The court can make exceptions.

567
00:34:52,048 --> 00:34:53,132
You still have a lot of explaining to do.

568
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,634
That's why you will come with us.

569
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:07,897
Let go of her.

570
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,026
Madam…

571
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,621
Oh.

572
00:35:26,165 --> 00:35:27,458
Excuse me.

573
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,804
Nurse, Sergeant Emil Royales.

574
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:40,721
Call the guard downstairs.

575
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,558
Tell him not to let the patient,
Attorney Morales, escape.

576
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:46,352
He's wearing light beige long sleeves
and dark blue pants.

577
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:47,270
- Okay?
- Okay, sir.

578
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,396
Let's go.

579
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:53,109
Animal.

580
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:56,112
- You're crazy.
- You're the one who is crazy.

581
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,447
You will push my mother?
You will kill her?

582
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,533
It's your mother who started it.

583
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:02,285
She tried to kill me.

584
00:36:02,368 --> 00:36:03,870
You started it.

585
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:04,996
You killed my father.

586
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:07,915
You're a family
who's not using your brains.

587
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:10,084
All you do is accuse me.

588
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,961
- You're a killer.
- Let go of me, Amando.

589
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,046
- Stop it. Stop that.
- I will kill you.

590
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,965
- That's enough.
- How dare you.

591
00:36:16,048 --> 00:36:17,633
I said enough.

592
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:22,471
Amando, take Aurora to her room.

593
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,724
And, everyone, leave.

594
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,559
Madam.

595
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:35,109
Where is George?

596
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,611
- Where is George?
- Oh.

597
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,779
Oh, Galvan. I saw your daughter-in-law.

598
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,115
She sneaked out.

599
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,117
She escaped from you.

600
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,879
Sir, come with us.

601
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:01,761
- He went that way.
- Where?

602
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,721
- There.
- Over there, sir. There.

603
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:04,972
He went that way.

604
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,432
She can't do that to you, Mother.

605
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,475
I will file a case.

606
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:09,101
I will sue her.

607
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:10,144
Sam, hold on.

608
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,854
Ma'am Aurora might file a counter-suit.

609
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:14,523
It was Mother who first attacked her.

610
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,193
And you too, Sam.
You pushed her on the balcony

611
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:18,236
and you also strangled her.

612
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,488
I got scared.

613
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:22,907
I thought she would kill Mother.

614
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:26,994
But, you're right.

615
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:28,788
She will seek revenge.

616
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:32,792
So, maybe it's better
if you both go home first.

617
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,212
It is dangerous,
they might kill each other.

618
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,382
You'll be alone here?

619
00:37:41,759 --> 00:37:43,886
Mother, I need to stay here.

620
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,222
I need to find evidence
against Mom Aurora.

621
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:48,474
Sam, no. I won't allow you.

622
00:37:48,557 --> 00:37:52,436
Francis, Mom Aurora will not touch me
as long as I'm pregnant.

623
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,562
Even so, Sam.

624
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:55,314
You need protection.

625
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,566
I'll not protect you now,

626
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,694
especially as I grow stronger
because I'm cancer free?

627
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,945
What?

628
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:05,283
Are you cancer-free? Are you well now?

629
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:06,284
Yes, Mother.

630
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:07,868
The chemotherapy worked.

631
00:38:08,577 --> 00:38:10,288
There are no more cancer signs in me.

632
00:38:10,371 --> 00:38:11,664
Oh, my God.

633
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,999
Thank you.

634
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,626
Thank you, Lord.

635
00:38:28,597 --> 00:38:30,224
Our dear…

636
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,522
Iñigo, good thing you're still here.

637
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,399
Ms. Georgina.

638
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,902
Stay away from Attorney Morales.

639
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:42,945
He is one of the Palacios killers.

640
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,280
He is Juliet's accomplice.

641
00:38:44,363 --> 00:38:45,406
What?

642
00:38:46,949 --> 00:38:48,701
Don't come near us.

643
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,748
Iñigo…

644
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,459
Sir Galvan, Iñigo kidnapped George.

645
00:38:56,542 --> 00:38:59,170
- What?
- Help. I will not go with you.

646
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,546
Help.

647
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,589
<i>What are you doing?</i>

648
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:03,424
You're flirting with that guy again.

649
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:04,842
Didn't I warn you before?

650
00:39:04,925 --> 00:39:06,385
Mom, we're just praying for Auntie George.

651
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:10,389
Nothing will happen with your prayers,
so just reserve that for other things.

652
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,725
Are you sure Sofia is your daughter?

653
00:39:12,808 --> 00:39:14,727
Because she has sense while you don't.

654
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:17,563
<i>Rico, get two knives.</i>

655
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:22,151
<i>I will watch</i>
<i>these uneducated women kill each other.</i>

656
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:26,197
NEXT EPISODE

657
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,865
Mother!
