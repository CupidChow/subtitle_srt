1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,890
- You animal.
- Ma'am, stop it.

2
00:00:15,974 --> 00:00:18,893
Don't do something that you'll regret.

3
00:00:18,977 --> 00:00:21,146
I'll give you my word.
I'll dig deeper into this case.

4
00:00:21,229 --> 00:00:22,897
Aside from what Ms. Samantha mentioned,

5
00:00:22,981 --> 00:00:25,024
I also saw a discrepancy

6
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:26,818
in Sergeant Casas' report.

7
00:00:26,901 --> 00:00:30,196
In my watch, I'll make sure
that no detail will be missed.

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:33,116
If my grandchild comes out,
the baby George is pregnant with,

9
00:00:33,199 --> 00:00:35,869
and you continue to taunt her family,

10
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:37,412
I'll send you back to Baguio.

11
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:40,707
No need. I just agreed
to this stupid DNA test

12
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:43,501
to prove that I am carrying Basil's child.

13
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,297
But, I won't agree
that he'll grow up here with you.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,841
I swear to God, Sam.

15
00:00:49,924 --> 00:00:52,594
I will find evidence

16
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,054
to prove that you pushed my son.

17
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,264
Francis, we need
to find Basil's cellphone.

18
00:00:56,347 --> 00:00:57,599
We need to find it.

19
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,226
Miss, last time you approached me,

20
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:02,353
you were asking me about the twins.

21
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:03,605
I'm sorry, Ma'am.

22
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:04,939
I made a mistake.

23
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,649
Miss, I'm begging you.
Please tell the truth.

24
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:09,569
I'm really sorry. I'm telling the truth.

25
00:01:10,278 --> 00:01:11,738
Hello, Sir Amando.

26
00:01:11,821 --> 00:01:13,740
I already talked to Ma'am Rebecca.

27
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,492
I did what you ordered me to do.

28
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,787
Get Basil's laptop in the other house.

29
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,747
I'm sure the report is there.

30
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:22,540
- Yes, Madam.
- Go, now.

31
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:24,459
What, Francis? did you find the cellphone?

32
00:01:24,542 --> 00:01:25,502
Sam, not yet.

33
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,171
Maybe it's better if we recall
what happened in the party.

34
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:30,381
<i>Maybe we can think of a clue.</i>

35
00:01:30,465 --> 00:01:32,300
Sam, could it be
Basil's cellphone is in the…

36
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:33,885
…motorcycle.

37
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:36,137
Here's the key.

38
00:01:37,472 --> 00:01:40,266
Here it is.

39
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,852
What is Basil's password on his laptop?

40
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,229
This is Basil's cellphone. This is it.

41
00:01:44,312 --> 00:01:47,065
‪PREVIOUSLY

42
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:53,613
I just emailed the compliance reports.

43
00:01:53,696 --> 00:01:56,533
Send them first thing tomorrow.

44
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:28,731
<i>I did not kill Doc Orly.</i>

45
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:30,859
<i>You know I couldn't.</i>

46
00:02:30,942 --> 00:02:32,652
My God…

47
00:02:32,735 --> 00:02:34,696
My God, Paco…

48
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:38,950
<i>I swear, you didn't know your father well.</i>

49
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,541
<i>You're so shameless.</i>

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:57,093
<i>Sam, you didn't know your father well.</i>

51
00:02:57,176 --> 00:03:00,138
<i>He took advantage of the miners,</i>
<i>he gets money from them.</i>

52
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,223
<i>All just to sustain his own addiction.</i>

53
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,517
<i>How dare you.</i>

54
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,146
<i>Just to save yourself,</i>

55
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,064
<i>you will ruin my father's memory?</i>

56
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:12,859
<i>- You're so shameless.</i>
<i>- Sam, I'm telling you the truth.</i>

57
00:03:12,942 --> 00:03:14,736
<i>Your father was a bad person.</i>

58
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,405
<i>He hid a lot of things to you.</i>

59
00:03:17,488 --> 00:03:19,490
<i>He's a liar, a fraud.</i>

60
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,368
<i>It's you and your mother who are frauds.</i>

61
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:23,870
<i>Your family hides a lot of secrets.</i>

62
00:03:23,953 --> 00:03:25,246
<i>Sam, don't turn the tables on us!.</i>

63
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,624
<i>I'm not lying.</i>

64
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:30,126
<i>I know what I heard.</i>

65
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,421
<i>I know that your mother is covering you up</i>

66
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,340
<i>for what you did.</i>

67
00:03:36,507 --> 00:03:38,468
<i>You killed my father.</i>

68
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,727
<i>- We're done.</i>
<i>- No, no.</i>

69
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,395
<i>Let go of me.</i>

70
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,064
<i>Don't.</i>

71
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:52,649
<i>I won't let the police arrest you for now</i>

72
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:53,858
<i>because I don't have an evidence.</i>

73
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:56,361
<i>But, I promise,</i>
<i>you'll pay for what you did.</i>

74
00:03:58,613 --> 00:04:00,448
<i>I will kill myself. I will jump.</i>

75
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:02,283
<i>Go ahead and commit suicide.</i>

76
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:04,744
<i>I don't care. Do whatever you want.</i>

77
00:04:04,827 --> 00:04:06,079
<i>You don't believe me, do you?</i>

78
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,538
<i>I'll show you.</i>

79
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,332
<i>I'm going to jump. I'll take you with me.</i>

80
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,125
Oh, my God.

81
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:14,879
<i>Let me go.</i>

82
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,308
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

83
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:31,854
Oh, Paco. My darling. Darling boy…

84
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:33,648
My God.

85
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:35,650
My God…

86
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:47,370
You're an animal.

87
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:49,664
You're a demon.

88
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,935
You're an animal, Sam.

89
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:17,900
You will pay for what you did to my son.

90
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:26,367
You're an animal.

91
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:30,079
You're a demon,

92
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,533
Mother, we already found
Basil's cellphone.

93
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:09,869
No one will see Sam's video.

94
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:13,414
Your sister said Basil told her
that's not the only copy.

95
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,208
What if someone finds it?

96
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,876
Mother, that won't happen.

97
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:18,127
No one is looking for it.

98
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,462
What the police are looking for

99
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:21,464
is Basil's cellphone.

100
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,049
And, Mother, I think,

101
00:06:23,132 --> 00:06:25,802
Basil only said that to Sam to scare her.

102
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,764
Samantha.

103
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,274
Oh, Sam…

104
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,448
My child…

105
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,992
George, are you really sure
of your decision?

106
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:53,746
We need the Palacioses.

107
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:56,958
Can you raise my grandchild in poverty?

108
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:00,211
Mom, we won't go poor.

109
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,214
George, where will your savings take us?

110
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,550
We haven't gotten anything
from Basil's death

111
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:07,844
because the case is not yet solved.

112
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,471
If we leave now, even if the case is over,

113
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:12,515
Sir Galvan will no longer give it to us.

114
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,434
Mom, there you go again.

115
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:16,602
All you think about is money.

116
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:19,480
Not only that, George,
but your security too.

117
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:21,441
What if the Palacios killer follows you?

118
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:22,442
How about your baby?

119
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,988
Mom, the Palacios killer
will no longer follow us.

120
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,781
He will find out
that I don't have an interest

121
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,117
in introducing my child as a Palacios.

122
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,749
You're so shameless
for visiting my son's altar

123
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,003
after you pushed him off the cliff.

124
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:02,064
George…

125
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,900
George…

126
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,234
What do you need?

127
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:11,991
The DNA results came.

128
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:23,503
- Let go of me. You're hurting me.
- Let go.

129
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:24,921
Stop it, Ma'am Aurora.

130
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:27,089
- That's enough. Stop it.
- Stop it, Ma'am Aurora.

131
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:29,383
Sam is pregnant. My sister is pregnant.

132
00:08:29,467 --> 00:08:31,969
Stop using my grandchild.

133
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:36,641
This woman deserves to be punished.

134
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,436
How dare you.

135
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,813
Will you not stop, Ma'am Aurora?

136
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:50,488
Mother.

137
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,867
Sir Armando, help us.

138
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:56,369
Stop, Ma'am Aurora.

139
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,540
Stop accusing Sam.

140
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:04,293
It's not an accusation anymore, Mercy.

141
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:06,212
It's the truth.

142
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,464
I have a proof.

143
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:13,177
I saw the video of you, Sam,

144
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:17,265
pushing Paco off the cliff.

145
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:26,983
And?

146
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:30,820
The baby you're carrying…

147
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,783
It's Basil's child and it's a boy.

148
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,035
Look.

149
00:09:41,038 --> 00:09:44,750
You got ahead of me
in finding out my baby's gender.

150
00:09:46,669 --> 00:09:47,712
Anyway…

151
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,007
it's just right
that we're packing out things

152
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,676
because we're leaving now.

153
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,386
Why are you leaving?

154
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:57,471
I told you yesterday.

155
00:09:57,555 --> 00:09:59,432
I will take my son away from here.

156
00:10:00,516 --> 00:10:03,686
I don't want him to grow up with you.

157
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:09,025
I don't want him to grow up knowing

158
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:10,985
that his own grandfather doubted him.

159
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:12,945
Come on, George.

160
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,531
That was just my initial reaction.

161
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,491
You can't blame me for that.

162
00:10:17,575 --> 00:10:21,162
George, maybe you can think it over first.

163
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:23,623
Mom, we're leaving.

164
00:10:23,706 --> 00:10:25,041
You and Ward should pack your bags.

165
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,917
You're not going anywhere.

166
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,878
I won't allow it.

167
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,213
My grandson stays here.

168
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,341
He will be born here. He will grow up

169
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:34,925
and grow old here.

170
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:38,679
You have no right to dictate to me
what I will do with my child.

171
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:40,890
- I am his grandfather.
- No.

172
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:44,393
Ever since you accused me
of all the killings here on the estate,

173
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,979
you ceased to be my father-in-law.

174
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:52,318
When Basil died, I felt so alone.

175
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,695
But, what did you do?

176
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,406
You accused me of being a murderer.

177
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:01,786
Even with Beverly's death.

178
00:11:03,037 --> 00:11:07,249
I've decided to cut my ties with you,
with the Palacioses.

179
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,920
Is that why you're mad at me?

180
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,296
Fine.

181
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,842
I will call Royales
and tell him to stop investigating you.

182
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,179
It was he who said that…

183
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:21,764
you're not yet a suspect,

184
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:24,767
and he couldn't find a piece
of evidence against you.

185
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:30,189
You are not leaving. You're not leaving.

186
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:33,401
You will pay for what you did to my son.

187
00:11:34,402 --> 00:11:38,030
I will have you jailed
and you will die there.

188
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:40,241
You will rot there.

189
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,992
You're a shameless woman.

190
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:47,456
- Ma'am Aurora, stop it.
- Let go of her. Stop it.

191
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,232
Ma'am Aurora, stop it.

192
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:14,567
- Stop it, please.
- No one leaves the estate.

193
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,527
- We are leaving.
- Georgina.

194
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,577
Let's go, Sam. She's going crazy.

195
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:27,204
Go after them, Amando.

196
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:29,123
What are you doing? Go after them.

197
00:12:29,206 --> 00:12:31,459
Don't let them escape.

198
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:33,169
Go after them.

199
00:12:40,551 --> 00:12:42,511
George, please.

200
00:12:44,138 --> 00:12:46,474
Basil is gone.

201
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,767
My grandchild with Beverly is also gone.

202
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:50,519
Don't include my grandson

203
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,522
with those I lost and those who left me.

204
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:54,982
I don't want to be left again.

205
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:57,485
George…

206
00:12:58,736 --> 00:13:00,237
I will do everything…

207
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,198
just tell me.

208
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:07,703
Just don't take my grandchild
away from me, please.

209
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,791
George, maybe you can give Sir Galvan

210
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:17,588
another chance for the baby.

211
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,094
I will think about it.

212
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:27,515
Dad. Dad.

213
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,644
Auntie Aurora is accusing Sam
of pushing Paco off the cliff.

214
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:33,145
Again?

215
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,897
But, Paco's case is already closed.

216
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,816
She said she had a proof. There's a video.

217
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,610
The incident was recorded.

218
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:43,781
George…

219
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,824
promise me you're not leaving.

220
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,702
Let's talk later.

221
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,329
I'll just go to Aurora.

222
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,886
Don't follow them anymore.

223
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,471
- But, Mommy…
- Just listen.

224
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:09,640
Just stay here.

225
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,104
Don't follow.

226
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,314
You're pregnant.

227
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:20,317
There might be shooting there
and we'll get involved.

228
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:23,654
Think about your baby, okay?

229
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:42,756
Rebecca.

230
00:14:43,883 --> 00:14:45,134
Rebecca.

231
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:48,345
I've been looking for you.

232
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,264
Sam and Auntie Aurora are fighting in the…

233
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,224
I know, I know.

234
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,810
I saw them before I went here,

235
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:57,146
and I don't care.

236
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,523
They can kill each other if they want.

237
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:02,067
They are still our family.

238
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,319
And so?

239
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,239
If there's something
we can fix, let's do it.

240
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,493
That's why you're looking for me…

241
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,496
to intervene in their chaos.

242
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:17,708
Rebecca, you're the only one who
can calm your Auntie Aurora.

243
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,461
I hate her.

244
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:22,588
I hate her.

245
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,132
She's a liar.

246
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,176
Jericho, I begged her.

247
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,346
I begged her until she tells me the truth,

248
00:15:30,429 --> 00:15:34,558
but she still denied
that I got pregnant and had babies.

249
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,814
Maybe she's telling the truth.

250
00:15:40,898 --> 00:15:42,524
No.

251
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:45,402
Rebecca, you have no memory.

252
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,112
You can't remember.

253
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,156
So, don't force it.

254
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,034
Just believe your Auntie Aurora.

255
00:15:52,117 --> 00:15:54,828
Do you believe her?

256
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:56,830
She's a liar.

257
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,832
She's a liar.

258
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,542
She lived as a liar,

259
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:03,045
she will die as a liar.

260
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:10,052
But, you don't have proof
that you got pregnant or gave birth.

261
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:14,556
Well, I just don't want you…

262
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,767
to hope for something that's not real.

263
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,269
You will look for your babies and then…

264
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,605
there's really nothing.

265
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,796
Let us out. We're begging you.

266
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,676
Please let us pass.

267
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:52,553
- Please let us pass.
- Let us out.

268
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,054
- Please.
- Let us out.

269
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,764
Samantha.

270
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,600
Do you think

271
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,603
you can escape what you did to my son?

272
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,527
- Hey, stop it.
- Stop it.

273
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,487
Let go of me.

274
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:13,157
Please let us leave.

275
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:15,242
- Let us leave.
- No, Mercy.

276
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,327
You're not leaving.

277
00:17:17,411 --> 00:17:19,329
Until this case is over,

278
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,166
you will stay with me.

279
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:28,005
You will only leave
if this woman goes to jail.

280
00:17:28,088 --> 00:17:29,923
Your daughter needs to pay, Mercy.

281
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,761
- Get that woman.
- No. Not my mother.

282
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,972
- Don't touch my mother.
- Don't. Don't.

283
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,348
- Don't.
- Sam.

284
00:17:38,432 --> 00:17:39,975
What now, Sam?

285
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:42,269
- Mom, please.
- Ma'am Aurora…

286
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:44,605
Will you confess now?

287
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,441
You better confess

288
00:17:47,524 --> 00:17:49,693
because if not,

289
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,654
your family will be involved too.

290
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,783
Have you forgotten what I told you?

291
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:03,707
I will kill the family who pushed my son.

292
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,460
- Sam… Ma'am Aurora…
- Sam, don't.

293
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,670
You have nothing to confess.

294
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,922
- Stop him.
- Sam, don't.

295
00:18:10,005 --> 00:18:12,132
Stop him. He's so talkative.

296
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:13,967
- Make his mouth bleed.
- Don't.

297
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:16,053
Francis.

298
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,638
- Francis.
- Don't.

299
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,515
Don't hurt my brother, please.

300
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:21,141
Don't, please. Not my family.

301
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,935
Sam…

302
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:25,270
Will you still be stubborn?

303
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,064
I will hurt your mother next.

304
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,315
- Don't.
- Amando.

305
00:18:28,398 --> 00:18:29,733
- Sam.
- Don't.

306
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,569
Don't.

307
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,742
Sam…

308
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:42,287
I will count to three.

309
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:46,166
My dear, dear murderous daughter-in-law.

310
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,585
- Sam.
- Don't.

311
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,629
- Don't, please.
- If you still won't confess…

312
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,799
you won't have a brother
or mother to call.

313
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,217
- One.
- Don't.

314
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:58,137
- Two.
- Don't.

315
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,264
- Three.
- Don't.

316
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,306
- Yes!
- Sam.

317
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:04,560
I killed Paco.

318
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:08,272
Yes, I pushed my husband off the cliff.

319
00:19:08,355 --> 00:19:10,274
Yes.

320
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,694
But, everything was just an accident.

321
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,446
I didn't mean to push him off the cliff.

322
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,031
- Mom…
- So, it's true?

323
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,826
Yes. It's true, Galvan.

324
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,246
This woman pretending to be a saint…

325
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,665
did push my…

326
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:31,420
my darling boy, Paco, down that cliff.

327
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,255
I didn't mean it.

328
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:35,799
Please forgive me. I didn't mean it.

329
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,968
Damn you, Sam.

330
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,722
Whether you did it intentionally or not,

331
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,807
you still pushed him and he died.

332
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:48,896
How could you do
that to the man who loved you?

333
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:52,441
To the man who fought for you
against his own mother?

334
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:55,319
Uncle, he wanted me dead.

335
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,654
He wanted to take me to die with him.

336
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:00,073
That's why I accidentally
pushed him off the cliff.

337
00:20:00,157 --> 00:20:01,950
I didn't mean it.

338
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,785
Liar.

339
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:05,787
Sir Paco would not do that.

340
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,040
Why would he kill himself?

341
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,544
- Because I was leaving him.
- That is bullshit.

342
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,466
He would commit suicide because of you?

343
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,635
I know my nephew.

344
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:24,806
He would not die
just for someone like you.

345
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,226
Do you know Paco?

346
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:31,772
So, you also knew his monstrous ways,
the nephew you are bragging about?

347
00:20:31,855 --> 00:20:33,023
Animal.

348
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:36,401
After you pushed my son,
you will destroy his image?

349
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:38,904
My son is not a monster.

350
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,822
He took me to a sex party.

351
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,825
Isn't that disrespectful?

352
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,495
Maybe you're as filthy as he is.

353
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,748
All right.

354
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:52,876
Since we're all exposing everything here…

355
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,755
yes, he took me to a sex party…

356
00:20:56,838 --> 00:21:00,217
to share me with his friends.

357
00:21:01,134 --> 00:21:03,387
But, I let that slide.

358
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,597
But, I can't forgive him

359
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:08,141
for what he did to my father.

360
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,813
Yes, Francis.

361
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:16,775
It was Paco who killed Father.

362
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,789
Don't accuse my son.

363
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:35,627
Your stupid father died
of a drug overdose.

364
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:38,255
My father didn't commit suicide.

365
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,508
Your son killed him
and you covered up for him.

366
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,307
How dare you.

367
00:21:48,390 --> 00:21:50,892
You would even make up stories about me?

368
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,314
I heard you.

369
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,275
I heard you and Sir Galvan. I heard you.

370
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,028
You were talking on the third floor.

371
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:05,157
Don't blame my son. I saw what happened.

372
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,075
It was Amando.

373
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:11,204
It was Amando who ran him over, not Paco.

374
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,415
Really, Aurora?

375
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,959
You'll cover up for Paco again…

376
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:18,879
like how you covered up for him
with what he did to Dr. Orly.

377
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:33,977
I don't want you to hope
for something that's not real.

378
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,521
You'll only get hurt, Rebecca.

379
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:39,941
You know…

380
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,133
Jericho, it's me.

381
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:07,844
Delia?

382
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:08,929
Why are you here?

383
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,847
I just came back for my things.

384
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:15,685
I will leave, but I saw both of you.

385
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:19,981
I can get in trouble
with what I'm about to do…

386
00:23:21,316 --> 00:23:22,651
but I'm also a mother.

387
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,154
I can't bear…

388
00:23:27,739 --> 00:23:29,282
not to tell the truth.

389
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,702
You indeed…

390
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:35,247
got pregnant before, Ma'am Rebecca.

391
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:36,456
I saw this in the library.

392
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,583
Ma'am Rebecca got pregnant?

393
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:45,173
Who gave you the right to feast
on Rebecca's private life?

394
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:48,135
I didn't meddle with her things.

395
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,595
Pack your belongings.

396
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,182
You leave this estate.

397
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,821
And I confronted Paco for it.

398
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,073
I did not kill Dr. Orly.

399
00:24:10,157 --> 00:24:12,325
I know what I heard.

400
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,245
Yes.

401
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,955
Your mother has long been defending you.

402
00:24:17,038 --> 00:24:18,832
Your family has been covering
for you for a long time.

403
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:23,086
You killed my father.

404
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:28,300
And I saw…

405
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:31,011
I saw the truth in his eyes.

406
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:33,638
And I know. I know.

407
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,808
That's why I told him…

408
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:39,311
that I'll expose
your family's filth to everyone.

409
00:24:39,394 --> 00:24:43,231
I will tell everyone that he's a murderer.

410
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,150
That's why he pulled me.

411
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,694
He wanted to involve me with his suicide.

412
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:49,905
That's it.

413
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,698
That's the truth.

414
00:24:51,781 --> 00:24:52,866
That's the truth.

415
00:24:52,949 --> 00:24:57,245
Liar. Liar. Liar.

416
00:24:57,829 --> 00:24:59,372
That's the truth.

417
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:02,334
No matter what you say, Samantha,

418
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,502
even if you make up stories,

419
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:06,963
no one would believe you in court.

420
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:08,548
Do you know why?

421
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:13,094
Because you have no proof while I do.

422
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:20,518
So, prepare yourself to rot in jail.

423
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,149
Why would I wait?

424
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,277
I will punish you now.

425
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,447
I will lock you up.

426
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,213
Are you telling the truth?

427
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:49,381
Yes.

428
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,176
I saw your picture
while you were pregnant.

429
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:59,015
Sir Amando saw us.
That's why Ma'am Aurora fired us.

430
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,309
Ma'am…

431
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,895
promise me

432
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,690
you won't tell them

433
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:09,276
that I told you…

434
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:10,568
that you got pregnant.

435
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,030
Please, promise me.

436
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,784
Ma'am Aurora will kill me.

437
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,335
Where are you going?

438
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,420
To Auntie Aurora.

439
00:26:28,503 --> 00:26:30,046
Don't worry, I will not betray you.

440
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,339
- Rebecca, wait.
- What?

441
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,092
It's you who said
that your Auntie Aurora is a liar.

442
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:36,553
She was born a liar and will die a liar.

443
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:37,971
Do you think she'll admit it to you?

444
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,765
But, I want to see my children, Jericho.

445
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:43,435
She's the only one who knows
where they are.

446
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,187
Rebecca, you will see them.

447
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,064
I promise.

448
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,232
But, don't rush.

449
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,069
Let's plan the things
we'll be doing carefully.

450
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,825
Calm down, okay?

451
00:27:11,838 --> 00:27:14,632
Let go of me. Let go of me, you animal.

452
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,217
- Sam. Sam.
- Let go of me.

453
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,136
Let go of me. You fool.

454
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,305
Let go of me.

455
00:27:20,388 --> 00:27:21,723
- Come here.
- Let go of me.

456
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,099
- Come here.
- Sam.

457
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,435
Sam. Ma'am Aurora.

458
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:27,062
Ma'am Aurora…

459
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,981
Francis. Francis.

460
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:31,149
Francis.

461
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,526
Ma'am Aurora, my child.

462
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,778
My child.

463
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,238
Go ahead and continue that.

464
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,991
Just one touch
and this will go live on social media

465
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,369
and what you're doing will be trending.

466
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:44,245
This will reach the police.

467
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,831
Okay, I'll stop now.

468
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:49,042
Amando.

469
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,252
Francis. Francis.

470
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,879
Don't. Francis, give that to him.

471
00:27:52,962 --> 00:27:54,756
Francis, don't.

472
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,553
Let me go.

473
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:03,181
No Castillo will…

474
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:05,934
leave this estate.

475
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,852
Do you all understand me?

476
00:28:07,936 --> 00:28:10,021
Yes, ma'am.

477
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:15,652
Amando, make sure…

478
00:28:15,735 --> 00:28:17,904
that there is no video.

479
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:19,280
Yes, ma'am.

480
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:22,409
You are all animals!

481
00:28:27,372 --> 00:28:29,374
By the way…

482
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,751
we'll see you in court.

483
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,300
Mom, I'm sorry.

484
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,152
It looks like the trouble is over.

485
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,945
They're all going home.

486
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:00,989
Dad. Dad.

487
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,285
Dad. Dad.

488
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:06,911
Dad.

489
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,997
Is what I heard true?

490
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,541
Did you try to hurt Sam?

491
00:29:11,624 --> 00:29:13,501
Sofia, shut up.

492
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:14,794
I don't want to talk about it.

493
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,796
So, it's true?

494
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,507
You've hurt Sam.

495
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,968
How could you, Dad? She's pregnant.

496
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,636
I said, shut up.

497
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,222
You're just like your mom.
You're meddlesome.

498
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,683
You're ruthless.

499
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,602
You're like monsters.

500
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:32,854
What did you say?

501
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,607
Oh, you heard me the first time, Dad.

502
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:37,358
But, let me repeat it.

503
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:41,321
You and Auntie Aurora,
you're like monsters.

504
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,406
Dad, don't.

505
00:29:52,749 --> 00:29:54,626
It's Paco who killed dad.

506
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,127
That's why you fought on the cliff

507
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,837
and accidentally pushed him.

508
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,633
He was denying it to me over and over,
but I know it was him.

509
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:03,384
He killed dad. It was him.

510
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:06,846
Your suspicion was right, Sam.

511
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:10,683
And now they'll hurt us?

512
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:12,727
They're animals. I'll get back at them.

513
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,981
Francis…

514
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:23,404
Francis. Don't. What's with you?

515
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,406
- Didn't I tell you…
- No.

516
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:26,407
They killed Dad.

517
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:27,826
- Francis, stop it.
- They're abusing us.

518
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:29,494
What kind of a person am I
if I do not seek revenge

519
00:30:29,577 --> 00:30:31,746
- for my family, huh?
- Give me that, please.

520
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:34,123
Francis, I've committed a lot
of sins in my life.

521
00:30:34,207 --> 00:30:36,668
You already got involved.
I don't want to involve you again, please.

522
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:37,919
Please give me that.

523
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:40,463
It's true that I killed Paco.

524
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:43,216
What, Sam? Is your conscience
bothering you?

525
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,802
You just defended yourself.
You're innocent.

526
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,222
He was pulling you.
He wanted to take you with him.

527
00:30:49,305 --> 00:30:51,224
He also wanted you to die.

528
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:57,021
They are all animals. They will all pay.

529
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,189
Francis, that's enough.

530
00:30:58,273 --> 00:31:01,192
Yes, they are animals,
but they are monsters.

531
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,447
Dad, don't hurt Sofia.

532
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,950
The next time you meddle again…

533
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,243
What's that, Dad?

534
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:14,038
You will hurt me too
just like what you did to Sam?

535
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,582
You have the nerve to answer back.

536
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:16,833
Please.

537
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,169
Sofia is just a kid who answers back.

538
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,547
Just let her be.

539
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:26,259
Sofia, you shouldn't
be answering back to your parent.

540
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:34,809
Ward…

541
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,562
go out.

542
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,482
Are you okay?

543
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,453
What happened, Cairo?

544
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,671
Auntie Aurora sent a message.

545
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:05,548
To me too.

546
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:08,801
Me too.

547
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,519
It was Sam who pushed Paco.

548
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:30,073
Sam, move aside. I said move aside.

549
00:32:30,156 --> 00:32:31,532
I said no, Francis.

550
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,410
What's with you? Do you think…

551
00:32:34,494 --> 00:32:36,746
they'll be scared
of the gun you're holding?

552
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:39,082
Mom has a shotgun.

553
00:32:39,165 --> 00:32:41,751
Just one shot at you
and your head will explode, Francis.

554
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,338
And if you get lucky and make one shot,
what will happen to you?

555
00:32:45,421 --> 00:32:47,757
You will go to jail again.
Is that what you want?

556
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:48,967
Sam, I don't care.

557
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,510
I am sick. I have cancer.

558
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:53,513
I will end up
either in the cemetery or jail.

559
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,515
Even if I go to jail, it's okay.
As long as I can seek revenge on them.

560
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,601
- I'll eventually die there.
- You will not die, Francis.

561
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,603
You'll get well and you won't go to jail.

562
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:04,565
You know, just to end all this,
I'll do it.

563
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:06,818
I'll go to jail. I don't want
this anymore. Let's end this.

564
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:08,111
What's with you, Sam?
What are you talking about?

565
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:09,779
What will happen if you go to jail?

566
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,406
What will happen to your baby?

567
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:14,867
Do you think you'll be
with your baby if you go to jail?

568
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:17,620
For sure, Ma'am Aurora will hide
the baby away from you.

569
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:22,041
Sam, you just defended yourself.

570
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:25,044
It's not your fault.
That's why you shouldn't go to jail.

571
00:33:25,128 --> 00:33:26,629
You shouldn't go to jail.

572
00:33:27,964 --> 00:33:30,466
I don't know how to defend myself.

573
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,926
I have no proof.

574
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:34,721
I don't know how to defend myself.

575
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,222
- Mother?
- Let me do it.

576
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:40,059
I will confront Ma'am Aurora.

577
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:48,901
That Samantha is something else.

578
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:51,696
It was she who really pushed her husband.

579
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:54,490
She acts very well.

580
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,951
Her performance is award-winning.

581
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,746
So, what Ma'am Aurora said is true.

582
00:33:59,829 --> 00:34:02,540
She should go to jail. She's so shameless.

583
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,127
Why, George?

584
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:09,130
I'm just thinking.

585
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,967
If Sam pushed Paco,

586
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:15,970
could it be that she was the one
who poisoned Basil?

587
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:24,645
- Mother…
- Mother, please.

588
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,064
- Mother, please.
- Let go of me.

589
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,106
Let me.

590
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:29,609
- Let me fight with Aurora.
- Mother, please.

591
00:34:29,692 --> 00:34:31,402
Please, I don't want
my child to lose his grandmother.

592
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,071
I don't want my child to lose his uncle.

593
00:34:33,154 --> 00:34:36,032
Please, let's stop this. I'm begging you.

594
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:38,117
Please! Please!

595
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:40,119
Please, for my baby.

596
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,962
What are you doing here, huh?

597
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,130
- Francis!
- Francis…

598
00:34:51,214 --> 00:34:54,550
No, we didn't come here for trouble, okay?

599
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:58,721
Sam, Auntie Aurora sent me a video.

600
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,975
And I think she sent it to everybody.

601
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,061
Maybe you've seen it already, right?

602
00:35:09,273 --> 00:35:11,025
You pushed Paco?

603
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:20,660
What happened was an accident.
I didn't mean it.

604
00:35:20,743 --> 00:35:23,246
I just defended myself.

605
00:35:32,839 --> 00:35:34,132
Sam, give me your hand.

606
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:35,633
Rebecca…

607
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,306
Please, please…

608
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:20,803
Maybe Sam poisoned Basil.

609
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:24,015
Maybe she's the real Palacios killer?

610
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,101
She first killed the cousins
and then she killed Beverly.

611
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,145
And then she killed Peter.

612
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,732
She kills the Palacioses

613
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:36,152
so her child will benefit from it.

614
00:36:36,235 --> 00:36:38,613
With Beverly, it's possible.

615
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:41,991
But, Peter. She was with me at that time.

616
00:36:42,617 --> 00:36:44,744
It's easy to pay and order someone.

617
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:49,373
Well, she got a lot of money
from Paco's death.

618
00:36:49,457 --> 00:36:52,251
With just five thousand,
you can get a killer.

619
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,130
You have a point, Mother.

620
00:36:57,006 --> 00:36:58,049
That woman is an animal.

621
00:36:58,132 --> 00:37:00,801
Maybe she did poison Basil.

622
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:14,065
Sam…

623
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:18,903
everything you said is true.

624
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:23,783
Just tell Auntie Aurora,

625
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,159
so she knows the truth.

626
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,536
Auntie Aurora will not believe that.

627
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,538
Because she will only believe
what she wants to believe

628
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:32,500
and that's all her lies.

629
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:34,502
Just like how she lied to me.

630
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:47,306
Sam, I feel sorry for you.

631
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,434
I really am.

632
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:54,355
We're both victims of Auntie Aurora.

633
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,943
I'm sorry.

634
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,499
Be careful.

635
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,044
Just let me know if you need my help.

636
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:20,715
I'm ready to protect you and your baby.

637
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,260
You're also my family now.

638
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:07,511
Ma'am Aurora thought uploading
this video would help her.

639
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,182
What she didn't know

640
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:14,310
is that she just gave me
a weapon against her.

641
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,771
What do you mean?

642
00:39:18,814 --> 00:39:21,817
The video that Basil showed me,

643
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:24,028
that video was cut short.

644
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:26,030
But, this one…

645
00:39:26,113 --> 00:39:28,366
This video that Mom Aurora
is spreading around,

646
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,617
this is the whole video.

647
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:32,661
It clearly shows that Paco wants
to take me to my death.

648
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:35,122
That I only defended myself.

649
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,791
She should be ready.

650
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,378
After all this,

651
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,964
I will sue her for slander and harassment.

652
00:40:01,315 --> 00:40:02,817
Why do you want to do it now?

653
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:05,653
I can't sleep, Jericho.

654
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,279
And I keep hearing my babies crying.

655
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:09,657
That's why I want to know the truth now.

656
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,242
What if your Auntie Aurora wakes up?

657
00:40:11,325 --> 00:40:13,828
No, she's a heavy sleeper.

658
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:37,476
Your Auntie Aurora is not here.

659
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,437
What?

660
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,021
But, it's late.

661
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,606
Where is she?

662
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,117
You really should have listened
to me, Paco.

663
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,827
About what?

664
00:40:54,910 --> 00:40:57,455
About marrying that woman.

665
00:40:57,538 --> 00:41:00,124
Did Sam do something to you again?

666
00:41:00,207 --> 00:41:03,169
Not to me, Paco.

667
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,087
But, to you.

668
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:07,173
It was her, Son.

669
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:10,009
She was the one
who pushed you off the cliff.

670
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:12,011
What?

671
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,603
Paco, I found this evidence.

672
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,189
Look.

673
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,528
<i>I did not kill Dr. Orly.</i>

674
00:41:29,612 --> 00:41:30,988
<i>No one did.</i>

675
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,741
<i>Because your father killed himself.</i>

676
00:41:34,867 --> 00:41:38,621
<i>I gave you a chance</i>
<i>to defend yourself, but…</i>

677
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,837
Aren't you even shocked at all, Paco?

678
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:53,802
Your wife pushed you off the cliff…

679
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:56,305
Then that's your reaction?

680
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:01,602
What do you want me to say?

681
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,524
Oh my God.

682
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:10,569
Don't tell me…

683
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:15,699
you knew all along, Paco?

684
00:42:19,745 --> 00:42:24,500
So, it's not true that you
didn't know what happened?

685
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:30,881
Are you still protecting
that leech wife of yours, Paco?

686
00:42:33,842 --> 00:42:35,553
Are you still covering up for her?

687
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:36,929
Mom, no.

688
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,889
I can't remember.

689
00:42:38,973 --> 00:42:41,725
But, why is your reaction like that, Paco?

690
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,727
What should my reaction be, Mom?

691
00:42:44,853 --> 00:42:50,401
You have evidence
that I was pushed by my wife, so?

692
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:53,529
I am here now.

693
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,948
Stuck in this hellhole.

694
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,034
You should get mad.

695
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:01,579
You said it yourself, Paco.

696
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:05,249
You're stuck here because of that woman.

697
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:08,294
Do you know what she said?

698
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:12,047
She said you were going to jump
off the cliff and take her with you.

699
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:14,216
What?

700
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:18,554
I would never kill myself.

701
00:43:19,305 --> 00:43:21,932
I know you won't!

702
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:24,602
Son, I know you won't!

703
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:25,936
So, please.

704
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,689
Don't sit there

705
00:43:28,772 --> 00:43:31,567
and act as if Samantha did nothing to you

706
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:33,444
because she did.

707
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:56,300
<i>I will miss you.</i>

708
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,260
- <i>Why are you holding my daughter's hand?</i>
- <i>Mom.</i>

709
00:43:58,344 --> 00:43:59,803
<i>That's not allowed.</i>

710
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,305
- Don't hurt my brother.
- Hey, how dare you!

711
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:03,098
Pack your things now.

712
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:04,099
<i>I threw Vivian out.</i>

713
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:07,770
You chose George over your mistress? Why?

714
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:10,189
All of you, listen
to what I'm going to say.

715
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:11,732
George is pregnant.

716
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,651
What? Another Palacios?

717
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,069
Another threat to your throne.

718
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,198
Spread it so it will reach
the Palacios killer

719
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:21,116
that George is pregnant.

720
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,078
<i>You're right, Sam.</i>
<i>We can fight this for self-defense.</i>

721
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,038
<i>My useless lawyers.</i>

722
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:30,000
They all agree that Sam has a strong case.

723
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:31,794
Where did you get the video?

724
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,129
From the laptop of Basil, your son.

725
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:35,422
Did he take the video?

726
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:36,757
Did you and Basil plan this?

727
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,802
You paid Sam to get rid of my son?

728
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,054
Let the killings begin.
