1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,223
Did you kill my father?

2
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:17,308
- Why the hell would you think that?
- Because I heard your mother.

3
00:00:17,392 --> 00:00:19,019
- No! No! No!
- You killed him!

4
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,562
I am not a murderer!

5
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:22,272
He and Ma'am Sam were fighting.

6
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:24,733
- George, have you seen my son?
- No.

7
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:26,025
Sam, I am here on the cliff.

8
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:27,152
Come here.

9
00:00:27,235 --> 00:00:28,570
<i>What? You'll commit suicide?</i>

10
00:00:28,653 --> 00:00:29,362
Yes!

11
00:00:29,446 --> 00:00:31,072
PREVIOUSLY

12
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:37,579
Who killed my son?

13
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:38,913
He jumped off the cliff.

14
00:00:38,997 --> 00:00:43,668
Liar! You better start praying
that my son survives.

15
00:00:43,752 --> 00:00:45,420
I'm sorry. He didn't make it.

16
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:47,213
You killed my son.

17
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,176
Sam was seen at the bottom of the cliff.

18
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:53,470
It's your sister who pushed my boss.

19
00:00:53,553 --> 00:00:54,637
You fool!

20
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:56,306
- Enough!
- Francis!

21
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:58,558
Don't accuse my sister!
You fool!

22
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:02,520
Pleasure from someone else's misfortune.

23
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:04,606
So it's always about the company.

24
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:07,400
It has always been about
the company, Basil.

25
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:09,486
And when the queen is at her lowest,

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,571
that's exactly when you step in.

27
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:18,119
Pa, have you found anything out yet
about what happened to Paco?

28
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,246
Did he really do it?

29
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,539
Did he commit suicide?

30
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:22,624
Shut up, George!

31
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,506
Paco wouldn't do such a thing.

32
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:42,268
You shouldn't have fought with him.

33
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,312
Mother, have you heard all of them?

34
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,397
They see Sam as a killer.

35
00:01:46,481 --> 00:01:48,066
I won't let that happen.
That's unacceptable!

36
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:05,291
Sam, tell me the truth.

37
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,502
Did you push Paco?

38
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:09,003
What's with you?

39
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:12,507
After you just defended your sister,
you'll ask her that?

40
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,469
Mother, I'm only asking Sam
so I can protect her better.

41
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,097
She found out something
about Papa's death.

42
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,141
That's already a reason
for them to suspect her.

43
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,144
So if she really pushed her husband,

44
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:27,147
I'll take responsibility for it
so there will be no more investigation.

45
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:28,148
What?

46
00:02:28,857 --> 00:02:30,942
Mother, I don't want Sam to go to jail.

47
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,944
Sam, if I need to tell a lie,

48
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:34,112
I will do it.

49
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:36,614
Just tell me the truth.

50
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,369
So I know what to tell the police.

51
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,000
Paco committed suicide.

52
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:49,419
I didn't push him.

53
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,267
I love you very much, Sam.

54
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,518
You and mother.

55
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:10,148
The three of us will be together
till the end.

56
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:11,482
No one will be left behind.

57
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,805
Auntie?

58
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,769
Auntie!

59
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,859
Auntie, what's happening?

60
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:56,986
Angie…

61
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,114
Why did you let Rebecca go out
at this time?

62
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,658
Amando.

63
00:04:02,784 --> 00:04:04,577
Rebecca deserves to know.

64
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,997
Deserves to know what?

65
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:13,378
It's about Paco.

66
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:14,837
What?

67
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:19,259
Your cousin is gone, Rebecca.

68
00:04:19,884 --> 00:04:22,720
He fell off the cliff. Someone pushed him.

69
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:25,139
Cliff?

70
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,106
Paco?

71
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:40,780
Cliff?

72
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:45,118
No!

73
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,620
No!

74
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,956
Paco.

75
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,959
No! Paco!

76
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,378
That's my dear Paco!

77
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,754
Paco!

78
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:59,007
That's my dear Paco!

79
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:00,258
No!

80
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:03,261
Why? Why?

81
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:07,056
Why?

82
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:10,268
Oh no.

83
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:16,983
No.

84
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:21,946
That's my dear cousin.

85
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:13,164
All the men
who get attached to their family die.

86
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,793
I pity Paco.

87
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:19,253
He's like Father,

88
00:06:20,963 --> 00:06:22,465
who also got victimized by a Castillo.

89
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,426
Not now, George.

90
00:06:26,010 --> 00:06:27,970
My husband just died.

91
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,223
Which is your fault

92
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,683
because you killed him.

93
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,940
How dare you?!

94
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,859
That's enough, George!
Please, George, stop!

95
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,237
- That hurts!
- You're shameless!

96
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,448
- Who pushed him?
- Don't hurt my sister!

97
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,325
Let go of me!

98
00:06:49,408 --> 00:06:52,120
- I can fight with you.
- Oh my God.

99
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,039
- Come here!
- I can't take it anymore!

100
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:58,167
- I'm not gonna back down!
- Let go of my daughter!

101
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,878
- That's enough, Sam.
- Let me go!

102
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:02,839
Is this what you want?

103
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,674
How dare you

104
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,884
low-lifers

105
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:09,637
to turn this place of grieving

106
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,305
into a circus?!

107
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:15,143
Don't you know how to choose
a time and a place for that?

108
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:17,186
You have no manners!

109
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,150
My son is dead!

110
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,695
Someone killed him,

111
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:32,410
and you're turning my house
into a marketplace!

112
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,008
Mrs. Aurora Palacios, ma'am.

113
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:38,267
Sergeant Major Abdul Casas.

114
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,812
I'm the one in charge of this case.

115
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,358
May I?

116
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:58,496
What's your relationship with the victim?

117
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,582
I'm his mother.

118
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:07,713
Your staff and the people
we interviewed said

119
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:11,551
that you were at the scene
moments after it happened.

120
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:13,219
Your son's fall.

121
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,096
Why were you there?

122
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,100
I'd just come back from a party.

123
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,103
I was looking for my son

124
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,232
because I was told that

125
00:09:26,315 --> 00:09:28,609
he and Sam had fought.

126
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,236
Samantha Palacios?

127
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:33,030
His wife?

128
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:34,532
Yes.

129
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:36,909
Where is Paco? Is he in his room?

130
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,495
I don't think so, ma'am.

131
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:41,664
Only Ma'am Sam is there.

132
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,333
Peter, come with me. Let's look for Paco.

133
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,169
George, have you seen my son?

134
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,379
No.

135
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:50,172
Is Paco missing?

136
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,550
Peter, let's hurry! Paco!

137
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,052
When I went down…

138
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:02,768
<i>Sam was beside Paco's body.</i>

139
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:05,104
<i>George was there too.</i>

140
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:06,397
<i>My nephew's wife.</i>

141
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:08,941
She'd just got there.

142
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:21,329
Am I a suspect now?

143
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,541
At this point, everybody is a suspect.

144
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,876
No.

145
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,628
No…

146
00:10:28,711 --> 00:10:30,755
not at all.

147
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,923
It's Sam.

148
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:34,675
She killed my son.

149
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:37,845
Wait, ma'am.

150
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,641
Ms. Aurora Palacios, the reason I'm here

151
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:44,560
is to find out who really killed your son

152
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,563
or if he really was killed.

153
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:16,133
Ms. Georgina Palacios, ma'am.

154
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,146
Sam, Mother is still restless.

155
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,357
She keeps on crying because she's nervous.

156
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,775
Maybe you can talk to her.

157
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,777
I don't think
they're going to call you yet.

158
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,320
Just let her rest.

159
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,572
She'll only get more nervous
if she stays here.

160
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,371
I'm nervous about what George will say.

161
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,747
She might ruin my reputation.

162
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:49,667
Sam, don't be nervous.

163
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,168
Don't think about it.

164
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,462
I don't think she'll do that.

165
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:56,465
George is mad at me.
She'll try to pin it on me.

166
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,937
Have a seat, ma'am.

167
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,274
Sarge.

168
00:12:23,617 --> 00:12:24,869
Abdul?

169
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,515
Take care over there.

170
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,361
Be careful, George.

171
00:13:00,362 --> 00:13:01,864
Call me when you get there.

172
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:05,451
George!

173
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:07,328
George, wait!

174
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:09,788
- Please, let's talk first. Please, please.
- You don't have a future with him.

175
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:12,166
- Please, let's talk. Don't leave me.
- Get in the taxi, George.

176
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:13,584
Abdul!

177
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,087
You have nothing to offer my daughter!
So please, just let her be!

178
00:13:18,297 --> 00:13:19,465
Please!

179
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,926
Go ahead, George.

180
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,261
Driver, please go.

181
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,513
George.

182
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,139
George, wait. Hold on, George.

183
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:29,141
Let's talk first. Don't leave me, please.

184
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,601
I'm begging you, please.

185
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,145
Don't. Please, George!

186
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,230
Hold on!

187
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:36,732
George talk to me!

188
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,444
George, please! Please!

189
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:41,779
Please, stop and get out!

190
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,197
Talk to me!

191
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,240
George!

192
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,045
Sergeant Major Abdul Casas.

193
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:00,256
In charge of this case.

194
00:14:06,554 --> 00:14:08,055
Please,

195
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,557
have a seat.

196
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:27,449
Since there are three
Mrs. Palacios in this case,

197
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,661
may I address you by your first name?

198
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,747
Yes.

199
00:14:36,292 --> 00:14:38,961
According to the information
that we've gathered,

200
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:44,758
Ms. Aurora Palacios said that
you two saw each other

201
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,429
before you went out.

202
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,101
I'd also just gone out.

203
00:14:55,811 --> 00:14:58,981
I saw Auntie Aurora looking for Paco.

204
00:15:00,482 --> 00:15:02,568
- We got separated…
- Ms. Georgina.

205
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:04,737
Please don't get ahead of my questions.

206
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,866
We'll get to that.

207
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,332
Ms. Aurora said

208
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,461
that you saw each other
even before you went down the cliff.

209
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,136
Yes, I was on the patio, trying to rest.

210
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,603
Don't lose hope, George.

211
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,147
You'll eventually get pregnant.

212
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,818
I volunteered

213
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:48,614
to go with Auntie Aurora
to help look for Paco.

214
00:15:51,033 --> 00:15:52,409
No.

215
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,078
Is Paco missing?

216
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,288
Do you want me to go with you
and help look for him?

217
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:57,665
No.

218
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:10,219
I saw Auntie Aurora by the cliff,

219
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,304
looking down,

220
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,264
but I went straight down the cliff.

221
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,393
And when you went down?

222
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:22,314
I saw Sam beside Paco's body.

223
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:26,735
Would you know

224
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:31,657
how Mr. Paco Palacios fell?

225
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,492
Was he pushed

226
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:35,452
or did he accidentally fall?

227
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,333
I don't know.

228
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:45,230
- George?
- Sam?

229
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:47,649
George, my child?

230
00:17:50,152 --> 00:17:51,278
Let's call Sam.

231
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:52,529
Yes.

232
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:55,699
Mrs. Samantha Palacios.

233
00:18:06,543 --> 00:18:08,629
Angie, come on, hurry!

234
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,422
- No, no! Stop!
- Ma'am.

235
00:18:10,506 --> 00:18:12,216
- Stop, stop, stop! Stop!
- Ma'am Rebecca.

236
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,135
Stop the investigation! It isn't necessary
because I'm the one who killed Paco.

237
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:16,345
No!

238
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,640
It's me. I'm the murderer.

239
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,142
I killed Paco.

240
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:38,992
I killed Paco.

241
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:41,036
No. What she's saying is not true.

242
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,663
We were together the whole night.

243
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,872
No, that's not true.

244
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:46,041
Can you prove that?

245
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,126
Me?

246
00:18:48,961 --> 00:18:51,088
No, no, him.

247
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,175
I'm not joking around here.

248
00:18:55,259 --> 00:18:56,426
Who am I talking to?

249
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,976
Ms. Rebecca, you're saying

250
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:08,772
that it was you who killed
Mr. Paco Palacios?

251
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,525
No!

252
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,994
Did you actually believe what she said?

253
00:19:22,077 --> 00:19:25,289
My niece has a mental illness.

254
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:28,876
She is schizophrenic, for God's sake!

255
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,797
Well, she did make a voluntary confession.

256
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:36,091
I still need to talk to her

257
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,509
about possible leads.

258
00:19:37,593 --> 00:19:39,636
I hope you understand, ma'am.

259
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:41,096
Yes.

260
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,806
I killed Paco.

261
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:45,267
I stabbed him.

262
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,560
I stabbed him

263
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:49,104
because he took Tonyo away from me.

264
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,231
That's why I killed Paco.

265
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,025
Auntie, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

266
00:19:53,108 --> 00:19:53,984
See?

267
00:19:54,484 --> 00:19:56,987
Paco didn't die from getting stabbed.

268
00:19:57,446 --> 00:19:59,615
He fell off the cliff.

269
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,534
His wife pushed him.

270
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:13,754
Why are you sitting there?
Go wipe the car.

271
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,257
Jerico!

272
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,552
Breaking news!

273
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,512
I have a juicy update.

274
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,973
- What?
- Ma'am Rebecca admitted

275
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:27,059
that she killed Sir Paco.

276
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:29,561
That's impossible.

277
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,316
Okay. I understand.

278
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,317
We'll just request

279
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,527
a competency evaluation for her.

280
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:38,987
Sir.

281
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,323
Sir, Ma'am Rebecca didn't kill Sir Paco.

282
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,908
I can prove that.

283
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,400
Sir, look,

284
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:00,319
Ma'am Rebecca was with Nurse Angie.

285
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:03,572
We were in the living room

286
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,490
when the rain was pouring hard
and there was thunder.

287
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,201
We took Ma'am Rebecca to her room.

288
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:11,163
Then Nurse Angie went out to get medicine.

289
00:22:11,538 --> 00:22:12,831
You can fast-forward the video, sir.

290
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:15,542
She was there the entire time.

291
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:17,586
I'll need to ask for a copy of the footage

292
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:19,338
because we'll need that on file.

293
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,923
You.

294
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:23,925
You left Rebecca's medicine.

295
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:25,635
You didn't give her medicine,

296
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:27,679
that's why she's acting up.

297
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,182
Just let it go, Aurora.

298
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,641
All right.

299
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:33,143
Everybody out.

300
00:22:54,706 --> 00:22:58,210
Amando, give them what they need.

301
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,600
Be thankful

302
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:16,728
Rebecca doesn't want you fired.

303
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,023
Excuse me, ma'am.

304
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,476
Who was Ma'am Rebecca's real father?

305
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,437
Sir Rodolfo.

306
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:03,400
The eldest brother
of Ma'am Aurora and Sir Galvan.

307
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,861
He died in an accident.

308
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,365
Why are you asking?

309
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,118
Nothing.

310
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,831
I've been observing you, Jerico.

311
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:21,668
I can see what you're doing.

312
00:24:26,047 --> 00:24:28,758
If you like Ma'am Rebecca romantically,

313
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:30,594
then stop.

314
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,723
Servants have no right

315
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:36,975
to fall for members
of the Palacios family.

316
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,730
I don't have feelings for Ma'am Rebecca.

317
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,774
It's not allowed.

318
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,820
It would be wrong.

319
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,315
Abdul?

320
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:14,447
What's that?

321
00:26:30,463 --> 00:26:31,756
What…

322
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,758
- What's with George? Where did she go?
- What's with your sister?

323
00:26:33,842 --> 00:26:35,343
You go that way
and I'll look for her here.

324
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:36,428
All right.

325
00:26:38,305 --> 00:26:40,223
- George!
- Sis!

326
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,642
My God.

327
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,144
George!

328
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,353
Call her.

329
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:50,317
Let it ring. She'll eventually answer.

330
00:26:58,033 --> 00:26:59,284
- What?
- Nothing.

331
00:26:59,367 --> 00:27:00,368
She's not answering me.

332
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:01,828
All right.

333
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:03,455
Call her again. Call her again.

334
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,332
Call her again!

335
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:09,085
George.

336
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:14,966
My child.

337
00:27:16,384 --> 00:27:17,844
What happened?

338
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:22,182
It's… earlier, George was looking pale

339
00:27:22,265 --> 00:27:24,559
when she came out from the interview.

340
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:30,190
It's just that
I felt a little dizzy, love.

341
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:33,443
I was startled.
I'm not used to things like that.

342
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:37,572
Did you feel dizzy?

343
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,577
Isn't… isn't that a sign that

344
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,537
you're pregnant?

345
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:47,332
Really, George?

346
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:49,167
I will be an uncle soon?

347
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,755
No, love, I'm not.

348
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:16,861
George, what was that about?

349
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,197
- What don't you want Basil to find out?
- Yes. What is it?

350
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,702
It's the investigator. It's Abdul!

351
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,870
What?

352
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:32,544
I was informed by Mrs. Palacios
and Ms. Georgina

353
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,588
that they saw you in front of
Mr. Palacios' body.

354
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:40,468
Tell me what happened before that point.

355
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:45,640
Paco and I fought.

356
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,976
Why did you fight?

357
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:53,398
Two nights ago,

358
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,360
he took me to a sex party.

359
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,868
I didn't like it. That's why we fought.

360
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:13,334
And then I wanted us to separate.

361
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:32,604
And then, before twelve midnight,
he called me.

362
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:36,149
He told me to come to the cliff,
or else he'd commit suicide.

363
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:42,947
Did you go to him?

364
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,325
At first, no.

365
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:50,121
But then I realized he might do
what he was saying he'd do.

366
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,957
That's why I went there.

367
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,961
I went there,
but before I reached the cliff,

368
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:00,131
I heard his scream.

369
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:01,966
That's why I went straight
to the bottom of the cliff.

370
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:03,176
Then I saw…

371
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,136
I saw his body.

372
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,680
You went straight
to the bottom of the cliff?

373
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,308
I didn't…

374
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,310
I didn't go to the top of the cliff.

375
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,899
He's mad at me.

376
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,068
Probably, since you left him.

377
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,154
What's the issue? Why does it
seem like you're still affected by it?

378
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,407
Hey, Ward, there's no issue,
and don't make one out of it.

379
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,577
You know, George, you need to avoid Abdul.

380
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:30,912
Let's avoid him.

381
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:35,959
Ward, watch your mouth.

382
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,420
No one can know about this,
especially not Basil!

383
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,479
What do you need?

384
00:30:57,355 --> 00:31:00,066
Can't you see that
I'm in the middle of an interview?

385
00:31:01,192 --> 00:31:02,819
Is it that important?

386
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,464
Ms. Samantha, you need to come with us.

387
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,447
Aside from Mr. Palacios,

388
00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,908
we found another shoe print

389
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,701
at the crime scene.

390
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,703
One of those is mine.

391
00:31:53,786 --> 00:31:54,954
Amando…

392
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:58,124
Mila, can you check it?

393
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,335
And I can show you where you found them.

394
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,046
Okay.

395
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:08,343
Over there.

396
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:11,346
Just like what I said, Detective,
I looked down.

397
00:32:13,348 --> 00:32:16,142
That's where I saw Paco's body below.

398
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:32,241
Ms. Samantha,

399
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:33,451
Ms. Georgina,

400
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:36,663
are those the sandals
you were wearing last night?

401
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,125
Yes.

402
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,837
Sir, no match with Ms. Georgina's.

403
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,936
Sir, Ms. Samantha's are a match.

404
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,287
Ms. Samantha…

405
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:06,377
you told us that you didn't come here.

406
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:12,300
But why are your footprints here?

407
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:36,908
My son defied me because he loved you,

408
00:34:36,991 --> 00:34:38,868
but you killed him.

409
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,369
And you can't deny it now.

410
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:42,163
The evidence is here!

411
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,999
Admit it, Sam.

412
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:46,584
You pushed my son!

413
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,086
You killed my son!

414
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:49,253
Ma'am Aurora, stop it. That's enough.

415
00:34:49,337 --> 00:34:50,755
Stop it, Ma'am Aurora. Stop!

416
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:51,839
Don't defend your killer sister!

417
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,174
- Let me go!
- No! No!

418
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:54,467
- Let me go!
- Please! Please!

419
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,968
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Stop it!

420
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,095
Stop it!

421
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,596
- No!
- Let go of me!

422
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:00,431
No! No!

423
00:35:00,515 --> 00:35:01,641
- Stop it!
- What?

424
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:05,436
That's enough. Stop it!

425
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,522
Yes, I came here last night!

426
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,692
But I didn't make it in time to stop Paco.
He'd already jumped off the cliff!

427
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,611
You're a liar!

428
00:35:13,694 --> 00:35:15,488
Paco would never do that.

429
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,407
- You pushed him!
- I said stop it!

430
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:19,492
Stop it!

431
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:21,035
Can you please stop?

432
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,789
We all want the same thing.

433
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:27,333
To find out what happened to Mr. Palacios.

434
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:32,547
So please, let us do our jobs!

435
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,084
Why did you lie?

436
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:12,920
Sarge, I got scared

437
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,798
because I thought that if I told you that
I was also there on top of the cliff,

438
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,675
you would also think that I killed Paco.

439
00:36:17,758 --> 00:36:20,011
But it wasn't me who killed him.
I just got scared.

440
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:21,596
Please believe me.
I really just got scared.

441
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,681
You know, if I were an ordinary person

442
00:36:23,764 --> 00:36:25,474
and not an investigator,

443
00:36:25,558 --> 00:36:27,310
that is what I would think.

444
00:36:27,393 --> 00:36:29,687
That you were there and that it was you
who pushed Mr. Palacios.

445
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,689
It was not me. I didn't kill him.
Please, believe me.

446
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:33,858
But you lied,

447
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,778
hoping no evidence would show
that you were really there.

448
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:40,198
- No.
- But no, there was evidence.

449
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,908
And now you don't know what to say!

450
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,326
It wasn't me who killed him!

451
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,912
Please believe me, Sarge,
I didn't kill him.

452
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:48,039
Please. Please.

453
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:51,083
But I'm not an ordinary person.

454
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,295
I'm an investigator.

455
00:36:56,672 --> 00:36:59,050
I don't believe in speculations.

456
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,678
Everything is based on evidence.

457
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,348
Based on what really happened.

458
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,558
So, Ms. Samantha…

459
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:14,357
tell me, what happened?

460
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,865
Sarge, everything I told you is true.

461
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:26,452
Except for the part

462
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,247
that I didn't go to the cliff.

463
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:32,541
All that, everything that I said is true.

464
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,528
I was on my way here
when I heard the scream.

465
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,614
Brother, kindly document.

466
00:38:05,616 --> 00:38:07,535
Ms. Samantha, can you show us

467
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:10,663
where you were standing
when you heard the scream?

468
00:38:10,746 --> 00:38:11,831
Here.

469
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,416
Over here.

470
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:17,169
I was here when I heard the scream,

471
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,171
but I came from over there.

472
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,013
And then, when I heard the scream,

473
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,222
I went over there.

474
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,184
And when I got there,

475
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,019
it was too late.

476
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:34,353
I could already see him below.

477
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:38,399
That's why I went to the stairs
to go to him.

478
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,774
Thank you, Mr. Palacios.

479
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,734
I'll take note of all your reminders.

480
00:39:21,817 --> 00:39:23,110
I'll take care of it.

481
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,363
Thank you.

482
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,028
I took care of everything, Aurora.

483
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:11,659
Only family and business friends
are invited.

484
00:40:11,742 --> 00:40:13,119
No press.

485
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:19,166
If a child who loses their parents

486
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:20,918
is called "orphaned"…

487
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:27,049
what do you call a mother

488
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:28,592
who loses her child?

489
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:05,254
These are Paco's clothes
that you asked for.

490
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,590
Thank you.

491
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:35,951
Aurora, it wouldn't look good on Paco…

492
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,453
in the casket.

493
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:42,333
I won't bury my son.

494
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:44,627
Galvan,

495
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,254
I will have him cremated.

496
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:51,133
Because…

497
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,054
if he is buried, he'll be under the ground

498
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,639
and the worms will eat him.

499
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:57,556
I don't want that.

500
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:02,561
I want him, his ashes,

501
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:05,940
to be with me all the time.

502
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:10,277
If that's what you want.

503
00:42:11,237 --> 00:42:15,616
So, that's what you'll have him wear
for his cremation.

504
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,869
But why that?

505
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,997
Remember, Galvan?

506
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,501
On my fiftieth birthday,

507
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,044
that's what Paco wore.

508
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:30,297
Because he wanted me

509
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,467
to just laugh

510
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:36,303
the whole night of my birthday.

511
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,180
- Remember?
- Yes.

512
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,392
<i>Seriously, Paco?</i>

513
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,898
<i>Oh my goodness.</i>

514
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,900
<i>Oh, you look good.</i>

515
00:42:49,984 --> 00:42:51,318
<i>Who am I?</i>

516
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:53,153
<i>Who am I, Ma?</i>

517
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:55,656
<i>I think I know who you are.</i>

518
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,324
<i>Watch this, Ma. Watch this.</i>

519
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:58,659
<i>- Watch this.</i>
<i>- Seriously?</i>

520
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:00,828
<i>- You will wear that on my birthday?</i>
<i>- Ma.</i>

521
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,121
<i>Wow.</i>

522
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,500
<i>Oh, my.</i>

523
00:43:08,961 --> 00:43:10,421
<i>Oh, you look good.</i>

524
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:11,839
<i>Who am I?</i>

525
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:13,340
<i>- Come on, Ma.</i>
<i>- Oh my gosh.</i>

526
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:14,174
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

527
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:16,093
<i>- Why not?</i>
<i>- Follow me, please?</i>

528
00:43:16,176 --> 00:43:17,595
<i>Okay, please.</i>

529
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,264
<i>- You'll be my first dance on my birthday.</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

530
00:43:20,347 --> 00:43:25,102
<i>- I'll show you some power moves, Mama.</i>
<i>- Really? Yeah, I like that.</i>

531
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:27,730
<i>Come!</i>

532
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,440
<i>That's so funny!</i>

533
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:35,988
<i>- Oh my goodness, Paco, please stop.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

534
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:39,158
<i>No, I'm not done.</i>

535
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,952
<i>All right!</i>

536
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,329
<i>Come on, honey.</i>

537
00:43:43,412 --> 00:43:44,872
<i>Okay, come on.</i>

538
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,337
Yes, yes, yes, I…

539
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,214
And he succeeded.

540
00:43:54,298 --> 00:43:56,675
You almost died from laughing, right?

541
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:09,688
That was my best night with Paco.

542
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:14,401
Look.

543
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,570
I mean the colors!

544
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:04,910
Galvan, this is all wrong.

545
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,001
It should've been him preparing
my funeral,

546
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:15,712
not the other way around.

547
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:22,761
A child shouldn't leave
before their parents.

548
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:28,267
Parents shouldn't bury their children.

549
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:53,375
Paco! Paco!

550
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,586
My son!

551
00:45:55,669 --> 00:46:00,132
Paco!

552
00:46:15,230 --> 00:46:20,777
Paco!

553
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:29,578
Sam, just tell the truth.

554
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,038
You're innocent.

555
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,956
Don't be scared.

556
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:39,379
Just hold on.

557
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:42,216
We'll overcome this.

558
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,967
Your brother and I are here for you.

559
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,389
Mother, I want to see Paco.

560
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,808
Not yet. Later.

561
00:46:51,892 --> 00:46:54,394
They will bring him here later.

562
00:47:02,694 --> 00:47:03,737
Sam,

563
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:07,366
there's talk outside that Ma'am Aurora
will have Paco cremated.

564
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,159
What?

565
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,874
- Wait, I'm his wife!
- Ma'am, you're not allowed.

566
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:17,834
- Let go of me!
- You're not allowed here.

567
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:20,212
- Ma'am, you're not allowed here.
- I am his wife!

568
00:47:20,295 --> 00:47:22,130
- Sir, you're not allowed.
- I just want to see him.

569
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,448
I'm sorry,

570
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:01,117
but Ma'am Aurora gave instructions

571
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,829
not to let you go near Sir Paco.

572
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:12,879
I didn't interfere with
the funeral arrangements of my husband

573
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,756
because I gave way to her.

574
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,385
Paco was cremated without my knowledge.

575
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:22,097
But I won't accept not being able to see
the ashes of my husband.

576
00:52:24,224 --> 00:52:27,394
Sam, just respect her decision.

577
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,730
If she wants respect,
she should respect me too!

578
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,566
I am his wife!

579
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,777
- Let me pass.
- You can't do this.

580
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:37,445
Sam, let's go in. Come on, let's go in.

581
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,406
- Stop her!
- Hold on! Hold on!

582
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:40,574
Come on, let's go in.

583
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,491
Move over! Move over!

584
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:43,535
- Let me through!
- Move over!

585
00:52:43,618 --> 00:52:45,495
- You're not allowed, sir.
- Move over!

586
00:52:46,955 --> 00:52:48,498
- Sam!
- Sam!

587
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:06,641
Paco.

588
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,917
How dare you touch my son's ashes?!

589
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,001
- Give it to me.
- Ma'am.

590
00:53:33,084 --> 00:53:33,960
- No!
- Ma'am Aurora!

591
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,795
- Ma'am Aurora, stop it.
- He's my husband.

592
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:36,880
Ma'am Aurora, enough! Ma'am!

593
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:40,592
- Why did you let this woman go near Paco?
- Ma'am! Ma'am Aurora, stop it.

594
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:45,722
<i>As of now, we don't have</i>
<i>enough evidence to file a case</i>

595
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,432
<i>against Ms. Samantha Palacios.</i>

596
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:51,478
<i>It's impossible that it was her</i>
<i>who pushed Mr. Paco Palacios.</i>

597
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,563
Fix this, General Alejaga.

598
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:57,776
I don't know why you gave us that kind
of investigator. He's worthless!

599
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,069
Replace him.

600
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:01,279
And don't accept any statement from Basil.

601
00:54:01,363 --> 00:54:02,280
He's a liar.

602
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,241
You and your family should
get out of my house!

603
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:08,203
I won't leave until I say goodbye
to my husband.

604
00:54:08,286 --> 00:54:09,996
Do you want to say goodbye?

605
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,540
- Come here!
- Ma'am Aurora!

606
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,334
There!

607
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,126
Do it!
