1
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,849
Let me tell you something.

2
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,101
Your father once wronged me in the past.

3
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:19,853
But I thought of you and Francis.

4
00:00:19,936 --> 00:00:22,689
That's why when he said he would change,

5
00:00:22,772 --> 00:00:23,648
I forgave him.

6
00:00:23,732 --> 00:00:26,609
Sam, he is not perfect,
but he's not a bad person.

7
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:27,986
He fought for you against his mother.

8
00:00:28,069 --> 00:00:30,405
That's why I hope you'll fight
for your relationship.

9
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:31,614
You need professional help

10
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:33,158
so we can fix our marriage.

11
00:00:33,241 --> 00:00:34,617
I also want marriage counseling

12
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:36,036
so we can address your problem.

13
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:37,328
<i>Our problem.</i>

14
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:39,164
<i>Sam is clinging to Paco.</i>

15
00:00:39,247 --> 00:00:41,374
She will not leave him
even though he is hurting her.

16
00:00:41,458 --> 00:00:43,084
Paco loves Sam.

17
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,503
If Sam leaves, Paco will be miserable.

18
00:00:45,587 --> 00:00:46,838
He won't be able to function.

19
00:00:46,921 --> 00:00:49,966
That's when I'll step in
to take his place in the company.

20
00:00:50,049 --> 00:00:51,634
PREVIOUSLY

21
00:00:52,594 --> 00:00:54,137
You startled me.

22
00:00:55,972 --> 00:00:56,639
Rebecca?

23
00:00:56,723 --> 00:00:58,892
- You might change your mind.
- Paco! Paco!

24
00:00:58,975 --> 00:01:01,686
Is your son here?
Your son is such a killer.

25
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:03,480
He killed Dash. He ran over him!

26
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:06,900
It was Amando who ran over
your pet, not Paco.

27
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,277
You're going to cover for Paco again?

28
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,863
Just like you covered for him
after what he did to Dr. Orly?

29
00:01:11,946 --> 00:01:15,575
All you do is cover for your son!
For his sins!

30
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,035
Is there someone in here with you?

31
00:01:17,118 --> 00:01:18,703
No, I'm alone.

32
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:45,522
Did you see who it was?

33
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:48,399
I'm not sure, but it looked like someone
left your workshop.

34
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,253
Who the hell are you?
Who dared to go up to my floor?!

35
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,216
Aurora.

36
00:02:13,299 --> 00:02:14,926
Aurora!

37
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:41,536
Rebecca…

38
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,163
Aurora…

39
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,248
Aurora, here.

40
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:55,341
Auntie…

41
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:00,346
- Rebecca, what are you doing here?
- Auntie…

42
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,265
I don't know.

43
00:03:03,308 --> 00:03:05,643
Rebecca, what do you remember?

44
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,438
Did you go to Aurora's workshop?

45
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:13,067
I think so.

46
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,445
I guess.

47
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:17,155
I don't know.

48
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:18,740
I don't know.

49
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,867
I think she sleepwalked again.

50
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,745
Where the hell is your nurse?

51
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:24,787
No!

52
00:03:25,788 --> 00:03:27,999
Nurse Angie, she…

53
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:30,460
Auntie, please.

54
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,712
Don't get mad at her.

55
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,048
Don't fire her.

56
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:37,967
For me.

57
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:45,975
She's the only nurse that I get along
with. And she helps me.

58
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:52,273
She helps me cope with…

59
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:56,319
the voices in my head.

60
00:03:59,197 --> 00:04:00,657
The…

61
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,035
Because lately…

62
00:04:21,177 --> 00:04:23,137
Because lately,

63
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,640
it's too much.

64
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:27,475
There's too many of them.

65
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,561
There are too many voices in my head.

66
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:33,106
So much voices in my head.

67
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,649
It's too much.

68
00:04:34,732 --> 00:04:36,526
I will never recover.

69
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,652
I will never…

70
00:04:37,735 --> 00:04:39,529
I will never get well, Auntie.

71
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,989
No. No. No. Please stop saying that.

72
00:04:41,072 --> 00:04:43,032
- Stop saying that.
- I am stuck here.

73
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,493
I'll be stuck in this condition.

74
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:48,079
Rebecca, stop saying that.

75
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:50,915
You will get well.

76
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:59,090
We will hire the best doctors
money can buy.

77
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:00,800
You will recover.

78
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,929
Look at me.
You look at me, look at me.

79
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,265
You will get well.

80
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,475
You will get well.

81
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,019
Do you understand?

82
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,228
I…

83
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,439
I will get well.

84
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:15,857
Yes.

85
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,191
I will get better.

86
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:18,234
You will get well.

87
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:23,281
I will get well?

88
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:26,326
You will get well.

89
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,788
I will get well…

90
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:43,801
Why are you on the third floor, Ma'am Sam?

91
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:45,595
You're not allowed here.

92
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:52,977
I followed Rebecca.

93
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:58,107
How about you? What are you doing here?

94
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,321
I'm…

95
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:05,823
I'm just looking for something.

96
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,022
<i>You're going to cover for Paco again?</i>

97
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:41,359
<i>Just like you covered for him</i>
<i>after what he did to Dr. Orly?</i>

98
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,675
I got it first! I got it first!

99
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:09,262
- Winner! I'm the winner!
- Oh my!

100
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,972
- You got it first?
- Yeah!

101
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,306
I just let you win.

102
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:13,975
- Oh my!
- Of course.

103
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,519
So you won't miss me
when I go back to the mines.

104
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:19,147
Pa, why do you have to go back there?

105
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,275
Just work here in Manila
so we can be together.

106
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,943
That's right, Pa.

107
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,406
Wow, thank you! That's a lot.

108
00:07:28,489 --> 00:07:30,074
Thank you. Thank you!

109
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:32,702
They came from the families
of my patients in the mines.

110
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,912
- That's a lot! Wow.
- Yes.

111
00:07:34,996 --> 00:07:38,624
They're running out of money
from buying medicines.

112
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,334
That's why they gave that as payment.

113
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:47,592
On behalf of Palacios Mining,
our deepest condolences.

114
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,766
Pa…

115
00:07:56,684 --> 00:08:00,104
How was Paco involved in your death?

116
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:08,321
Did I marry the person who killed you?

117
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:54,408
Hon?

118
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,995
I've already found
a marriage counselor for us.

119
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:02,416
Hon?

120
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,962
Is there something wrong?

121
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:12,426
Were you close with my father,

122
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:16,097
Dr. Orly Castillo?

123
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:18,015
No.

124
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,060
I just knew him a bit, that's all.

125
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,856
Anyway, I'll schedule
our first session so that…

126
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,069
What did you do to my father?

127
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,323
What?

128
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:39,579
Did you have something to do
with his death?

129
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:56,429
What's this?

130
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:58,389
I thought we were okay.

131
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,475
Why are you bringing up
the death of Dr. Orly?

132
00:10:02,143 --> 00:10:03,728
I'm just asking you a question.

133
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,146
You're accusing me.

134
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:06,772
Then answer it.

135
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,983
No! No!

136
00:10:09,066 --> 00:10:11,736
I had nothing to do with Dr. Orly's death.

137
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:12,987
He committed suicide!

138
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:14,655
He didn't commit suicide.

139
00:10:14,739 --> 00:10:15,990
He was killed!

140
00:10:16,657 --> 00:10:18,159
And you think I did it?

141
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:21,912
Why the hell would you think that?!

142
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,665
Because I heard
your mother and your uncle!

143
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:28,002
Your mother covered for you
for what you did to my father.

144
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:29,045
What?!

145
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,006
What does that mean, huh?
Tell me.

146
00:10:32,548 --> 00:10:34,425
Did you kill my father?

147
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:35,843
- Sam, no, no!
- Did you kill him?

148
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,887
- Admit it. Did you kill my father?
- I said no!

149
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:39,680
- Did you kill him?
- No, no, no!

150
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:41,265
I am not a murderer!

151
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:44,435
I did not kill him!

152
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:48,022
I said no! What do you think of me?

153
00:10:48,105 --> 00:10:50,107
I did not kill him!

154
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,736
I've been nothing but honest with you!

155
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,863
Why do you see me that way?

156
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,491
Why?

157
00:11:12,296 --> 00:11:14,173
Sam, please…

158
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:16,384
Please, Sam…

159
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,224
Sam…

160
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,226
Sam, please…

161
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,395
Please, believe me.

162
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,854
I'm sorry, sorry.

163
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:30,564
Sam, please.

164
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,319
You lied to me.

165
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,612
No! No!

166
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,197
Not this time.

167
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,157
I'm telling you the truth
this time, please.

168
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:41,909
Don't do this to us, please.

169
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,160
Please, promise me.

170
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,370
Sam…

171
00:11:45,246 --> 00:11:47,331
- Please.
- You're going to tell me the truth.

172
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,168
I am telling you the truth.

173
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,587
Please believe me, Sam! Please!

174
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:55,131
What's with you?

175
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:59,552
I won't stop until I find out the truth.

176
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,555
This is the truth, Sam, please.

177
00:12:02,638 --> 00:12:04,056
Don't do this to us, Sam!

178
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,976
Hon, please! Hon!

179
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,894
No, don't do this!

180
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,312
Sam!

181
00:12:15,359 --> 00:12:17,570
Ma, please.

182
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:19,780
Please answer, Ma, please.

183
00:12:21,615 --> 00:12:22,867
Please answer.

184
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,118
Sam!

185
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:24,994
Please…

186
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:28,622
Please, Ma. Please, please, please.

187
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,219
George?

188
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,721
Why are you crying?

189
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:10,307
Basil is in a hurry, Mother.

190
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,936
He wants us to have a baby.

191
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,479
You should.

192
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:18,649
Your child should be
the first Palacios grandchild.

193
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,193
Don't let Sam get ahead of you.

194
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,947
Mother, I have a slim chance
of getting pregnant.

195
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:27,575
Why?

196
00:14:27,658 --> 00:14:30,995
When Basil and I came back
from our honeymoon,

197
00:14:31,078 --> 00:14:33,664
I went straight to my obstetrician.

198
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:37,501
I was wondering why we couldn't conceive.

199
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,506
That's when I found out
that I had a problem with my uterus.

200
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:46,677
She saw some tissue scarring.

201
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,722
Why do you have that, George?

202
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,520
No! No! I said no!

203
00:15:02,776 --> 00:15:04,236
I'm sorry, madam.

204
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,237
I'm so sorry.

205
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,573
I'm sorry, madam.

206
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:42,232
You had a miscarriage?

207
00:15:42,316 --> 00:15:45,861
Mother, I didn't know I was pregnant
when I went to Singapore.

208
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:55,955
My doctor told me that the tissue scarring
most likely developed when I had surgery.

209
00:15:57,498 --> 00:16:00,751
Mother, what if
I can't get pregnant anymore?

210
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,172
The doctor didn't say
there was no chance, right?

211
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:07,591
As long as she didn't say
there was no chance,

212
00:16:07,675 --> 00:16:10,386
that means there's still hope.

213
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,888
Let's just pray for that.

214
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:17,309
You know, I know a herbal doctor.

215
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,354
She was able to
help a lot of women get pregnant.

216
00:16:20,437 --> 00:16:24,692
- If you want, we can try her.
- Okay, Mother.

217
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,653
I hope I can get pregnant.

218
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,826
I'm scared of what Basil will do
once he finds out about my situation.

219
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,370
He really wants to have a baby.

220
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:37,830
We will try, George.

221
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,790
Don't lose hope.

222
00:16:39,873 --> 00:16:42,876
We will go to that doctor, okay?

223
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,678
Ma!

224
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,513
Ma!

225
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,767
Ma!

226
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:02,396
Ma!

227
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:04,023
Ma…

228
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:06,942
Please, Ma.

229
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,736
I need you right now!

230
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:24,728
Is that why that jerk is kind to us, Sam?

231
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:27,648
Because he is trying to make up
for what he did to Papa?

232
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,401
My dear, we're still not sure about it.

233
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,569
Mother…

234
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,238
Sam heard them say it themselves.

235
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:38,075
Sam heard them say that
Paco did something to Papa.

236
00:18:38,158 --> 00:18:42,162
What else could he have done that would
need his mother to cover for him?

237
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,916
Calm down, Francis.

238
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:49,461
Mother, no. I won't calm down.
I need to do something.

239
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,466
What, you'll beat him? You'll kill him?

240
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:55,592
And then what?

241
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,177
You'll end up in jail?

242
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:03,559
What we need is justice, Francis,
not revenge.

243
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:14,611
I will look for evidence.

244
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,116
And once I can prove that
it was Paco who killed Papa,

245
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:23,078
I will have him arrested,
even if he is my husband.

246
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,080
He and his mother!

247
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,307
What, Paco?

248
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:10,477
Sam, I am here on the cliff.

249
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,355
Come here.

250
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,775
Let's talk or else…

251
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,318
What? You'll commit suicide?

252
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,319
Yes!

253
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,196
<i>You tried that trick before.</i>

254
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,865
You're not going to pull
the same trick on me again.

255
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:26,660
You fooled me once already!

256
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,579
Sam, I'm serious.

257
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,874
Why would I be here on the cliff
if I wasn't going to do it?

258
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,293
I'm serious, Sam!

259
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,771
Careful, please.

260
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,610
- What's with you?
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

261
00:22:00,694 --> 00:22:02,612
Peter, all you have to do is
hold the umbrella for me

262
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,489
and you can't even do that right!

263
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,158
Jerico?

264
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:08,994
Oh my God.

265
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:12,539
That's a custom-made
Cavalieri vase from Italy.

266
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:13,707
What happened?

267
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,043
Did you break it, Jerico?

268
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:17,169
No, ma'am.

269
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,754
We're trying to save it.

270
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:20,505
DJ went in to get some glue.

271
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:21,631
So what happened?

272
00:22:21,715 --> 00:22:23,050
Where did you get it?

273
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:25,135
DJ just gave this to me.

274
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:28,013
He saw this outside Sir Paco's room.

275
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:30,265
He and Ma'am Sam were fighting.

276
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,017
Again?

277
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,894
What were they fighting about?

278
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:35,729
He didn't say.

279
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,773
He said Sir Paco went berserk

280
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,734
and then he knelt in front of Ma'am Sam.

281
00:22:40,817 --> 00:22:43,361
What? My son did that?

282
00:22:44,362 --> 00:22:47,574
No Palacios kneels to anyone!

283
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,951
Where is Paco? Is he in his room?

284
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:52,245
I don't think so, ma'am.

285
00:22:52,329 --> 00:22:54,873
Only Ma'am Sam is there.

286
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:57,542
Where is DJ?

287
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,127
Where's my phone?

288
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:01,588
Tell DJ to look for my phone.
I left it here!

289
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:03,381
Yes, ma'am.

290
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,802
Peter, come with me. Let's look for Paco.

291
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,847
- Make sure you hold the umbrella well!
- Yes, ma'am.

292
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:14,017
Where did Paco go?

293
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,708
Don't lose hope, George.

294
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:22,627
You will eventually get pregnant.

295
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,014
Paco!

296
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:36,766
Paco!

297
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:43,940
- George!
- Auntie.

298
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:44,858
George!

299
00:24:44,941 --> 00:24:46,651
Have you seen my son?

300
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,695
No.

301
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:50,363
Is Paco missing?

302
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,283
Do you want me to join you
in searching for him?

303
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,618
No.

304
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,037
Peter, let's hurry!

305
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,622
Paco!

306
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:00,832
Paco!

307
00:25:05,587 --> 00:25:07,672
Where is my son?

308
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:09,925
Paco!

309
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,112
Paco?

310
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,405
Paco!

311
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,325
Paco, my son!

312
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:39,496
Paco, my son!
What are you doing?

313
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,581
Get out of here!

314
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,208
Get out of here! You're useless.

315
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:45,293
Leave!

316
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,797
Paco!

317
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,802
Paco, my son! Paco!

318
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,763
Paco!

319
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,433
Paco!

320
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,484
Paco!

321
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,946
Paco!

322
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,242
Paco!

323
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:19,304
Paco, my son…

324
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:15,360
Paco…

325
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,026
Paco?

326
00:28:58,194 --> 00:28:59,946
Paco!

327
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,678
Paco!

328
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,733
Paco!

329
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,782
Paco!

330
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:33,122
No, please.

331
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,129
Paco, no… no…

332
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,929
No, no…

333
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:08,324
Paco!

334
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,146
Sam, what happened?

335
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,689
What did you do to Paco?

336
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,191
No, please.

337
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:46,321
Paco!

338
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:56,581
Paco!

339
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,672
Oh my God.

340
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:06,007
Wake up, my son.

341
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:08,551
Wake up, please, please.

342
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,604
Wake up, please!

343
00:32:20,146 --> 00:32:23,066
Wake up, for God's sake!

344
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,694
Paco!

345
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:50,802
Who killed my son?

346
00:32:56,683 --> 00:32:59,435
Auntie Aurora, it wasn't me.
You saw me upstairs.

347
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,189
You!

348
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:08,111
You killed my son!

349
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,531
You killed Paco!

350
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,828
You fool!

351
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:37,056
Paco!

352
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:43,021
Paco, my son! Wake up, my son.

353
00:33:43,104 --> 00:33:44,605
Paco…

354
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,942
My baby…

355
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,861
My baby…

356
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:06,294
No…

357
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:18,848
Paco!

358
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,600
Paco…

359
00:34:21,017 --> 00:34:22,560
Paco!

360
00:34:22,643 --> 00:34:23,728
What happened?

361
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:25,646
Paco!

362
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,357
No…

363
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,281
Paco jumped off the cliff.

364
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,992
- Liar!
- Paco!

365
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,661
My son would never commit suicide.

366
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,080
You did this!

367
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,166
He is still breathing.

368
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:46,417
Somebody call an ambulance!

369
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,503
- You pushed my son!
- Hurry!

370
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:50,922
- Hello, emergency.
- Paco!

371
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,465
Yes, at the Palacios' Estate!

372
00:34:53,966 --> 00:34:55,676
Paco? Paco?

373
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,453
- Paco!
- Please, please…

374
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:24,497
Paco…

375
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,499
Paco!

376
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:36,342
You better start praying
that my son survives,

377
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,928
or else

378
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:42,140
I will push you off this cliff.

379
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,737
Paco, Paco, Paco…

380
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,532
Paco…

381
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:03,995
Paco…

382
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,831
Paco…

383
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,009
Paco, please.

384
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:20,678
Please, please, please.

385
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,186
Wake up, my baby.

386
00:36:28,269 --> 00:36:32,565
Please, please, please wake up!

387
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,775
My God!

388
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,527
My son!

389
00:36:37,612 --> 00:36:39,155
Please!

390
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:43,576
Please wake up, my son.

391
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,850
Sam. Sam!

392
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,518
- Paco needs me.
- Sam!

393
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,187
- My husband needs me.
- Sam!

394
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,521
- Sam!
- I need to be with my husband!

395
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:15,733
Sam, Ma'am Aurora is there already.
Just stay here!

396
00:37:17,193 --> 00:37:19,403
Sam, let's get in the car.

397
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,159
Paco…

398
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,663
Paco, my son…

399
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,831
Paco.

400
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:37,255
Attend to my son first, please!

401
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:38,589
Attend to Paco first, please!

402
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:41,175
Paco, my son. Paco!

403
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,929
Paco!

404
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:46,722
Attend to my son first, please.

405
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:48,391
Attend to my son first.

406
00:37:48,474 --> 00:37:51,143
Paco, my son? My God!

407
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,770
- Ma'am, just stay here.
- Hold on!

408
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,438
Ma'am, just stay outside, please.

409
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:56,232
- I'm sorry.
- My son needs me.

410
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:58,734
Ma'am, please stay here.

411
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,404
General Alejaga,

412
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:03,614
there's been an incident at the estate.

413
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:05,491
Send your finest men to investigate.

414
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,827
It seems there has been a murder.

415
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,916
- Where's Paco?
- Sam.

416
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,836
- It's okay, let us be for now.
- I want to see Paco, please.

417
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,421
- Stay here.
- Please, please.

418
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:22,341
You!

419
00:38:22,425 --> 00:38:23,676
You killed my son!

420
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,469
You pushed my son!

421
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:27,179
- You killed him!
- Ma'am, I would never do that.

422
00:38:27,263 --> 00:38:28,973
I love Paco. I would never do that to him.

423
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:30,474
He jumped off the cliff.

424
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:31,934
He jumped off the cliff.

425
00:38:32,685 --> 00:38:33,978
- You're a liar!
- Ma'am…

426
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,563
You're a liar!

427
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:39,066
Doctor…

428
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,735
Doc, how's my son? How is Paco?

429
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,737
How is my son?

430
00:38:43,446 --> 00:38:44,947
I'm sorry.

431
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:47,158
"I'm sorry"?
What are you talking about?

432
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,909
- I'm sorry.
- What do you mean, "I'm sorry"?

433
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,411
What happened to Paco?

434
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,621
What's happening to my son?

435
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:54,206
He didn't make it.

436
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,209
No!

437
00:38:57,835 --> 00:38:59,837
That's not true! That can't be!

438
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,881
Paco! My son!

439
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:13,768
No!

440
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,449
No, no, no, no, no.

441
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:30,326
No, please.

442
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:37,124
All I need right now is support.

443
00:39:39,126 --> 00:39:41,045
<i>Your support.</i>

444
00:39:49,595 --> 00:39:53,015
No! No!

445
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,768
Paco, my son!

446
00:39:55,851 --> 00:40:01,023
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

447
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,824
No! No! No!

448
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,991
No!

449
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:12,576
Please wake up.

450
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:16,288
Paco, my son.

451
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:23,754
Paco.

452
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:32,763
You're a murderer!

453
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:34,640
You did this.

454
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,517
You killed my son!

455
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:45,734
Ma'am, that's enough! Enough!

456
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:47,194
- Stop it, ma'am!
- You killed my son!

457
00:40:47,278 --> 00:40:48,070
Ma'am, that's enough!

458
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,780
I didn't kill him!

459
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,365
I loved Paco.

460
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,908
I loved him.

461
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,494
You're a liar!

462
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,787
Enough! Sam!

463
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:58,372
Sam, let's go. Let's go. Let's just leave.

464
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:00,541
No, I have a right to be with Paco.

465
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,460
- He's my husband!
- Sam!

466
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,128
Have some respect for our family!

467
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:05,379
Leave!

468
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,672
- I won't…
- I said leave!

469
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:08,716
- Get out of here.
- Hold on.

470
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:10,259
- Leave!
- Wait. Wait, we will leave.

471
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,635
You don't have to push us!

472
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,803
- No!
- Hold on!

473
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,139
- Come on, Sam. Let's go.
- No!

474
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:18,225
Sam, I'm begging you. Leave first.

475
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,562
- No. No.
- Please.

476
00:41:22,146 --> 00:41:23,439
Please

477
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,567
- No!
- Please.

478
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,125
No, no, no!

479
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:46,879
No!

480
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,427
No!

481
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:04,146
Hello, love?

482
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,856
How's Paco?

483
00:42:07,066 --> 00:42:08,651
Oh God…

484
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,236
Oh my God, no.

485
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,074
Okay, love.

486
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,575
Okay, fine.

487
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,787
The authorities are here.
They are starting to investigate.

488
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:22,998
Okay.

489
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,755
Forensics, yeah.

490
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:31,799
Okay.

491
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:36,011
No!

492
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,555
Paco!

493
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,644
Get a hold of yourself.

494
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,437
Don't be a sissy!

495
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,481
For God's sake,

496
00:42:47,565 --> 00:42:50,818
you're bound to be the next COO!

497
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:04,331
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

498
00:43:04,415 --> 00:43:06,750
No!

499
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:07,710
Aurora…

500
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:10,379
Please, no.

501
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:11,922
The forensics team are on their way.

502
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:13,132
No, no, no, no!

503
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:15,926
To get the body of Paco to bring
to the crime laboratory.

504
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,554
No, no, no, no. Please, Galvan, no.

505
00:43:18,637 --> 00:43:20,222
- Amando.
- No, no, no, no, no.

506
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:24,226
Take care of Aurora.
We need to handle something.

507
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,979
Please, I'm begging you, please.

508
00:43:27,062 --> 00:43:30,899
For God's sake, please wake up, my son.

509
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,949
No, no, no, no.

510
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,076
No!

511
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,079
No… no…

512
00:43:47,041 --> 00:43:49,084
Paco, please!

513
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,795
Paco! Paco!

514
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:53,547
Paco…

515
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:02,348
Amando, Amando, Paco…

516
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,599
Amando!

517
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:06,602
No, no, no!

518
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:10,314
My dear, please.

519
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:17,237
What happened?

520
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,283
That was terrible.

521
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,662
It's so shocking.

522
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,830
Even I was shocked.

523
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,128
It's really shocking.

524
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:36,215
What do you think happened?

525
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,354
Who is attending to him now?

526
00:44:51,188 --> 00:44:52,689
The Palacios family, Mother.

527
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:54,400
They drove us away.

528
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,986
They didn't even let Sam get near Paco.

529
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:06,495
You know, me too.

530
00:45:07,496 --> 00:45:12,584
Because Ma'am Sam pushed Sir Paco.

531
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:15,212
She killed her own husband.

532
00:45:15,295 --> 00:45:16,255
What did you say?

533
00:45:16,338 --> 00:45:18,173
- What did you say?
- Francis!

534
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,883
Sam didn't kill Paco.

535
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,635
If you don't believe that
Paco killed himself,

536
00:45:21,718 --> 00:45:23,512
that doesn't mean that you can
accuse my sister!

537
00:45:23,595 --> 00:45:24,721
Francis, stop it.

538
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:28,934
Why don't you look at your bosses?
What about Sir Galvan or Basil?

539
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:32,062
They're mad at Paco because
of the competition for their position.

540
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,440
What, is there proof that they pushed him?

541
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,650
Do you have proof that it was Sam?

542
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,486
Sam was seen below the cliff!

543
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,780
It's your sister who pushed my boss!

544
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:43,323
Is that so? You fool!

545
00:45:44,074 --> 00:45:45,284
- Francis!
- What?

546
00:45:45,367 --> 00:45:46,160
Francis!

547
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,911
- That's enough!
- Bring it on!

548
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,746
- Wanna fight?
- Please stop.

549
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,331
- Enough!
- Francis!

550
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:52,666
Hey, don't accuse my sister!

551
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:53,750
You're a fool!

552
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:54,710
That's enough.

553
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:23,530
Why is the press here?

554
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,326
How did they find out?

555
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,952
I don't know, sir.

556
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:31,580
Go ahead, just go straight.

557
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,606
Just send me the details.

558
00:46:57,689 --> 00:47:00,400
Don't approve anything until I say so.

559
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,403
Paco's funeral should be perfect.

560
00:47:04,071 --> 00:47:05,197
Thank you.

561
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,033
My assistant.

562
00:47:08,116 --> 00:47:10,369
Making arrangements for the wake.

563
00:47:10,869 --> 00:47:12,829
I already called the PR team

564
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:14,623
and ordered a news blackout.

565
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,960
The moment I find out
who informed the press,

566
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:19,795
they will pay for this.

567
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,679
I can't believe Paco's dead.

568
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,430
That asshole…

569
00:47:31,181 --> 00:47:32,891
That asshole's really dead!

570
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,898
Schadenfreude.

571
00:47:41,066 --> 00:47:42,442
What?

572
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:44,820
"Schadenfreude."

573
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:49,658
Pleasure from someone else's misfortune.

574
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:53,328
I only wanted Paco's position.

575
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,622
I didn't want him to die.

576
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:56,790
I know.

577
00:47:57,749 --> 00:48:00,794
But now he's dead
without you doing anything.

578
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,922
Soon, you'll get his position.

579
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,634
So it's always about the company.

580
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,929
It has always been about
the company, Basil!

581
00:48:11,471 --> 00:48:13,348
Without it, we're nothing!

582
00:48:14,308 --> 00:48:17,769
That's why you strike
while the iron is hot.

583
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:20,063
And when the queen is at her lowest,

584
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,232
that's exactly when you step in!

585
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,328
I'll take over leading this family.

586
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:36,413
Aurora.

587
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,458
Mrs. Georgina Palacios.

588
00:48:39,541 --> 00:48:41,376
I'm nervous about what George will say.

589
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:44,004
<i>George is mad at me.</i>
<i>She'll pin me down.</i>

590
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,881
<i>It's the investigator!</i>
<i>It's Abdul.</i>

591
00:48:45,964 --> 00:48:46,590
<i>What?</i>

592
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:49,968
<i>No one can know about this,</i>
<i>especially not Basil!</i>

593
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,345
<i>Didn't you call me?</i>

594
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,387
<i>Is there anything wrong?</i>

595
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:54,681
- She took a picture of us.
- Give me your cell phone.

596
00:48:54,765 --> 00:48:55,641
What's your problem?

597
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,643
It's your mother's fault.
She likes to meddle!

598
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,895
How dare you?!

599
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:01,396
You're so shameless!

600
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:03,023
Death card… It's another death.

601
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:04,858
Someone else will die.

602
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,652
Do you think Basil has a mistress?

603
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:08,945
<i>Don't be impatient.</i>
<i>Everything is falling into place.</i>

604
00:49:09,029 --> 00:49:11,782
You're trying to erase my son's memory.

605
00:49:11,865 --> 00:49:13,533
You will erase him from the company too?

606
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:16,953
- That will never happen, Basil.
- Oh, it will happen.

607
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:19,456
I am afraid of my dreams.

608
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,667
Someone always dies.

609
00:49:21,750 --> 00:49:24,044
