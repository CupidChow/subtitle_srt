1
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:29,112
CHUN-HUI AND EUN-GI

2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,700
CHUN-HUI AND EUN-GI

3
00:00:59,809 --> 00:01:03,146
Who's tried the famous skate
from Heuksan Island?

4
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,649
Who's heard of the famous skate
from Heuksan Island?

5
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:10,820
You can't get them here.
Pacific saury from the mainland.

6
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,113
Pacific saury.

7
00:01:12,864 --> 00:01:15,241
Eggs.

8
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,453
Tofu.

9
00:01:19,037 --> 00:01:21,664
Soft tofu.

10
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,210
Bean curd dregs.

11
00:01:29,255 --> 00:01:30,965
-Isn't there anything for us?
-Right.

12
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,592
BOK CHOY, PAPRIKA, PERILLA LEAVES

13
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:33,927
Here you go.

14
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,679
Keep track of how much we owe you
in your ledger.

15
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:38,056
Pay me in cash.

16
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:42,143
Dong-seok.

17
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:45,522
Can you fix the doorknob at my place?

18
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,357
Ask your son to do it for you.

19
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,319
He went to the mainland to get a job.

20
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:55,907
Then wait. I'll do it for you later.

21
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,123
Gosh, thank you for coming here
to fix that door.

22
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,750
Eat this first. It's for helping.

23
00:02:05,834 --> 00:02:07,293
Noodles? Great.

24
00:02:07,377 --> 00:02:09,587
Have some noodles. Thank you.

25
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,617
INCOMING CALL

26
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:46,666
This isn't Jong-u.

27
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,556
I'm not Jong-cheol either.

28
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,141
Dong-seok, can you…

29
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:06,311
take me to Mokpo next week?

30
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,482
-Where?
-Mokpo.

31
00:03:13,693 --> 00:03:14,903
Why?

32
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:17,864
The annual memorial service

33
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:21,492
for Jong-u and Jong-cheol's father
is next Saturday.

34
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:26,372
Are you crazy?

35
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,583
Have you lost your mind?

36
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,629
How could you call me
and ask me to go there with you?

37
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:35,298
I don't even attend
my dad's memorial service.

38
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,967
Why in the world
would I go to their dad's?

39
00:03:39,135 --> 00:03:40,678
What's the matter with you?

40
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,057
He was still your stepfather.

41
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,977
Come to my place at dawn next Saturday.

42
00:03:48,811 --> 00:03:50,730
Come pick me up and take me to Mokpo.

43
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,776
Hello?

44
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,614
Unbelievable.

45
00:04:06,746 --> 00:04:08,122
Damn it.

46
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,767
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

47
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,185
Damn it!

48
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:31,813
This old hag is driving me crazy.

49
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,857
Is she trying to start a fight or what?

50
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,820
CHUN-HUI AND EUN-GI 2

51
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,729
Don't just glare at me like that.

52
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:16,649
-Come here and eat.
-I'm not going to eat.

53
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:18,359
Why not?

54
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,655
Because you didn't take my side.

55
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,825
You also slapped my back.

56
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:32,415
If you eat this,
I'll take you to see the dolphins

57
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:35,501
and teach you
how to hold your breath underwater.

58
00:05:35,585 --> 00:05:37,378
Are you still not going to eat?

59
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:44,135
Goodness, I guess
I'll have to throw this out.

60
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,387
I'll just give it to a stray dog.

61
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,350
Grandma.

62
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:55,188
You were mean to me,
so you should apologize.

63
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,528
I'm sorry about yesterday. Here.

64
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,031
You can slap my back too.

65
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,742
Now, stop crying and eat.

66
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,591
Why aren't you slapping me?

67
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:27,220
Is it because I'm old?

68
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,182
Goodness, you're a funny one.

69
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,312
I like chicken. It's delicious.

70
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:39,357
Did you buy this for me?

71
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:43,861
I didn't buy it. I caught the chicken
out in that field over there.

72
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:45,696
What?

73
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,788
Look for it all you want, but it's gone.

74
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,688
This damn chicken escaped the cage again.

75
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,691
It's Kkokko!

76
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,612
I didn't catch the chicken

77
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,239
because it's your friend.

78
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,117
Do you like me now?

79
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,077
I want to eat.

80
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:39,792
If she likes Kkokko so much,
she shouldn't be eating chicken.

81
00:07:39,876 --> 00:07:41,002
Goodness gracious.

82
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,470
I can't believe I'm doing this.

83
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,513
What else?

84
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:54,182
Do you know where you need to go

85
00:07:54,682 --> 00:07:57,894
to see the 100 moons
that grant you wishes?

86
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,438
If you know where it is,
can you take me there?

87
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:03,065
A hundred moons, my foot.

88
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:06,944
You sound just like your father
when he was young. What nonsense.

89
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,490
Do you also know about the 100 moons?

90
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:14,452
My dad told me I was born
because he prayed to the 100 moons.

91
00:08:15,411 --> 00:08:16,913
Yes, I know.

92
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,707
But you can go there with your dad.

93
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:21,751
What else do you want me to do?

94
00:08:24,295 --> 00:08:26,297
Is this really necessary?

95
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,758
Must you wear this?

96
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:31,552
If I don't wear that,
my clothes will get wet.

97
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,889
This gets wet too, you know.

98
00:08:34,972 --> 00:08:37,475
And if it gets wet,
I'll have to wash it again.

99
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,852
Goodness, you know-it-all.

100
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:42,355
Go sit down.

101
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,122
My grandma is the best!

102
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,006
My grandma is the best!

103
00:09:11,842 --> 00:09:14,136
My grandma is the best
at holding her breath!

104
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,640
Dad was right! My grandma is the best!

105
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:21,185
My grandma is the best
at holding her breath!

106
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:36,158
A chick can chirp

107
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,287
A calf cries moo…

108
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,500
Hey, Mom!

109
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:53,843
Mom, I ate a lot today.

110
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,138
Grandma cooked me sausages and eggs.

111
00:09:57,221 --> 00:09:59,181
Tell her I also cooked chicken.

112
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:01,726
Mom, Grandma even cooked chicken.

113
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,312
Tell her I take good care of you.

114
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:06,981
Mom, Grandma takes
good care of me every day.

115
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,735
Mom, I'll put Grandma on the phone.

116
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:14,947
I'm sorry, Mother.

117
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:19,827
I couldn't pick up Eun-gi's call yesterday
because I was so busy with work.

118
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:22,204
I get that you're busy with work,

119
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,457
but you should still
make time for your kid.

120
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,625
SO-HAE HOSPITAL

121
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:29,629
How busy are you at work
that you couldn't even answer the phone?

122
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:31,422
You're a mother.

123
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:33,924
If you're going to keep doing that,
just take her home.

124
00:10:34,508 --> 00:10:36,260
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,685
Did you really leave Eun-gi here
because you were busy with work?

126
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:49,440
Of course.

127
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,236
By any chance, did you leave her here

128
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,364
because Man-su did something to upset you?

129
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,535
No, Mother.

130
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:06,165
Man-su doesn't do anything
to upset me these days.

131
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:09,960
Mother, you don't need to worry.

132
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:14,799
You still work at Mokpo Mart, right?

133
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:21,097
Mother, I need to get back to work.
I'll call you again later.

134
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:23,516
Doctor!

135
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:32,274
The mart says
she doesn't work there anymore.

136
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:34,527
But she says she still does.

137
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:36,821
What's going on?

138
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,830
FERRY SCHEDULE
FROM JEJU ISLAND TO MOKPO

139
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:54,547
Does your grandma not know that
your dad's in the hospital?

140
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:56,715
Why doesn't she know?

141
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:58,592
I didn't tell her.

142
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,720
She might collapse if she finds out
because she's old.

143
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:08,144
I hurt my leg once,
and my other grandma was so startled

144
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:11,313
that she collapsed on her way to my place.

145
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:15,109
She hurt her back because of that.
She says it still hurts.

146
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,819
That's why I'm not telling.

147
00:12:17,695 --> 00:12:18,863
I see.

148
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,074
Do you know a place
where you can see 100 moons?

149
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:23,826
There's only one moon.

150
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:26,162
My dad told me that

151
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:28,998
he knows a place in Jeju

152
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,833
where you can see 100 moons.

153
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,252
You can make 100 wishes there,

154
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,589
and your wishes come true all at once.

155
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:40,050
What will you pray for
if you ever see those moons?

156
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:42,344
I want to be a good swimmer.

157
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,263
I want to memorize the Korean alphabet.

158
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,849
I want to be able to count to 100.

159
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,809
I want to see dolphins.

160
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:52,688
I want my mom to stop
getting upset or angry at me.

161
00:12:52,771 --> 00:12:55,149
And I want to play
with my mom and dad every day.

162
00:12:56,484 --> 00:12:58,194
But there's only one moon.

163
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,905
Are you sure your dad didn't lie?

164
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:05,659
My dad doesn't lie!

165
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,954
He knows where you can see 100 moons.

166
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:12,958
He promised to take me there
once he's out of the hospital.

167
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,544
Lucky you.

168
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,798
My dad lies all the time.

169
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:24,261
He always promises to spend time with me,
but he never does.

170
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:26,722
I wish I could see those moons too.

171
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:30,100
So I can pray that
my dad would spend more time with me.

172
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:32,561
Once my dad is out of the hospital,

173
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,940
I might be able to take you with me
to see the 100 moons.

174
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,399
Sounds good, right?

175
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,987
-So-hui.
-Coming.

176
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,375
Come here.

177
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:08,430
Is your dad in the hospital?

178
00:14:10,349 --> 00:14:11,600
Eun-gi.

179
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,270
Eun-gi.

180
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,939
What are you two doing out in the street?

181
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,649
What is it?

182
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,027
Ok-dong, why is your face so pale?

183
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,156
Did your mom abandon you here

184
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,536
because your dad's in the hospital?

185
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,834
Where is your dad?

186
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:41,171
Baengnyeong Island by the Yellow Sea.

187
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:46,427
He went to Baengnyeong Island
by the Yellow Sea.

188
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:49,263
He went there to cut wood.

189
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,641
So he can buy me yummy things,

190
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,561
buy the moon boat,

191
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,981
and come see you.

192
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,443
He didn't go to a hospital in Mokpo.

193
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,697
He didn't hurt his head and legs!

194
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,074
He's not hurt!

195
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:14,622
Did your dad hurt his head
and go to a hospital in Mokpo?

196
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:15,915
No, he didn't!

197
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,834
He went to Baengnyeong Island
by the Yellow Sea!

198
00:15:19,418 --> 00:15:21,503
After a few more nights,

199
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,549
my mom and dad are going
to come and pick me up.

200
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,552
All right.

201
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:30,721
All right, let's go.

202
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:32,473
Come on.

203
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,856
Be careful.

204
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,693
If you get hurt,
it'll become bothersome for many people.

205
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,153
If that happens, I'll just kill myself.

206
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,281
You wouldn't have the guts to do that.

207
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,533
What about Eun-gi?

208
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:35,911
Just go to the hospital
and get your medicine.

209
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:40,040
Jeong-jun and Yeong-ok will be
taking care of Eun-gi.

210
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,793
They promised to show her dolphins,
so she went with them.

211
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:46,839
I didn't say anything
to Yeong-ok or Jeong-jun.

212
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:49,508
INSTALLMENT SAVINGS

213
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,643
-Is this for Ms. Kang?
-Yes.

214
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:03,105
It's two weeks' worth of medicine.
Take them 30 minutes after meals.

215
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,481
Here's your card.

216
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,249
-Let's go.
-All right.

217
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,012
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

218
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:12,424
Dong-seok should know.

219
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,718
What for?

220
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:20,265
Aren't you going to get married?

221
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,559
At least try going on blind dates.

222
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,229
I'll take care of myself.

223
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,817
That's nothing for you to worry about.

224
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,984
How annoying.

225
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:33,654
Why does that annoy you?

226
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,989
This is exactly why you're single.

227
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,460
I've lived a long life.

228
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,424
Lots of people die when they're young.

229
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,804
Dying at an old age
isn't that big of a deal.

230
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:08,147
By the way, those clouds
look like a herd of lambs.

231
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,642
-Over there!
-It's a dolphin!

232
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:46,685
-Do you see it?
-Yes.

233
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:48,437
Eun-gi, look! It's a dolphin!

234
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,938
It's a dolphin!

235
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:52,024
My dad was right!

236
00:19:52,107 --> 00:19:54,943
There are dolphins! They're really here!

237
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,947
Hi, Dolphin! My name is Son Eun-gi!

238
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,909
What's your name? Is it Dolphin?

239
00:20:05,746 --> 00:20:08,040
Look! Did you see that?

240
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:09,917
What? Is it Yeong-hui?

241
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,628
Yeong-hui, I bet this is
your first time seeing a dolphin.

242
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,254
HOUSE OF GRACE

243
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:16,131
It's a dolphin.

244
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:17,758
Just know that I'm a great sister.

245
00:20:18,342 --> 00:20:22,471
You promised not to call me often
if I showed you dolphins.

246
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,348
I…

247
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,808
I won't call you.

248
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:28,602
I'll call our beloved Jeong-jun.

249
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,105
I'll call the captain.

250
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,024
"Our beloved Jeong-jun"?

251
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:37,486
Feel free to call me whenever.

252
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,529
Enjoy looking at the dolphins.

253
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:45,035
Look over there. Did you see that?

254
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,871
-So cool.
-Eun-gi.

255
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,706
Goodness.

256
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,833
Eun-gi, did you see that?

257
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:55,420
Dal-i, my dad isn't a liar.

258
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:58,215
My grandma is the best
at holding her breath.

259
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:02,302
And dolphins really exist.
My dad was right about everything.

260
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,096
My dad isn't a liar.

261
00:21:04,179 --> 00:21:05,597
Of course.

262
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,518
Mom! Dad! Dolphin!

263
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,270
Grandma!

264
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,983
Eun-gi, how about a better view?

265
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:19,528
Is that better?

266
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,322
-Look at the dolphins!
-Look at that!

267
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,241
Hi!

268
00:21:30,497 --> 00:21:34,459
Is this where you take Bus 555?

269
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:35,585
Yes.

270
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:45,679
MOKPO PORT, BUS TERMINAL

271
00:21:54,021 --> 00:21:56,773
-Ma'am, you can sit here.
-Thank you.

272
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:00,902
-Thank you.
-Sure.

273
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,752
Does this bus go to Mokpo Mart?

274
00:22:18,003 --> 00:22:20,172
What? No.

275
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,591
-It's in the opposite direction.
-Goodness.

276
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,594
Excuse me, can you please stop the bus?

277
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,096
Excuse me.

278
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,057
Can I get off here?

279
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,225
Please just let me get off here.

280
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:34,436
MOKPO GRAND MART

281
00:22:34,519 --> 00:22:36,354
Hae-seon quit.

282
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,691
She's at a hospital in Mokpo
because her husband got into an accident.

283
00:22:40,358 --> 00:22:42,360
MOKPO GRAND MART

284
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,290
SO-HAE HOSPITAL

285
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,545
Excuse me.

286
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,800
My son's name is Son Man-su,
and I need to know if he's here.

287
00:23:05,342 --> 00:23:07,594
Can you check if he's here for me?

288
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,762
Sure.

289
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:15,185
He's in the ICU. It's that way, ma'am.

290
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:19,439
Okay.

291
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:36,665
The patient's guardians may come inside.

292
00:23:37,707 --> 00:23:40,710
You can only visit for 30 minutes.
Please leave on time.

293
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:41,837
Okay.

294
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,643
He's in here.

295
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:42,332
It's been…

296
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,335
a little over a month.

297
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,883
A speeding dump truck

298
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,971
crashed into Man-su's truck.

299
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,015
That's how it happened.

300
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:04,896
He was unconscious when they found him.

301
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,359
UNITY

302
00:26:10,443 --> 00:26:12,112
After we met in Seoul

303
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:16,324
and decided to move to Mokpo,

304
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:20,161
he took me to a tattoo parlor
and got that tattoo

305
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,998
to remind himself of how hard you work

306
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,252
so that he'd always stay grounded.

307
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,840
Man-su…

308
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,011
cared a great deal about you, Mother.

309
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,724
He may be unconscious,

310
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:43,476
but he's gotten a lot better.

311
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:48,356
He almost developed sepsis a few days ago,

312
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:50,859
but he overcame that.

313
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,989
He'll wake up soon.

314
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,783
Is that…

315
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:03,121
what the doctor thinks or just you?

316
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,587
I guess it's just you.

317
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:39,199
I got a few new jobs,

318
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,243
and I'm starting to get the hang of them.

319
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,373
I'll go pick up Eun-gi next week.

320
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,294
You must be tired.

321
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:55,799
You should sleep at our place
and head back tomorrow.

322
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:13,191
Just do as the doctor says.

323
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,737
If he advises you to stop keeping him
on life support, then just stop.

324
00:28:18,571 --> 00:28:21,116
It'll just be a waste of money and energy.

325
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,749
-Mother.
-And just leave Eun-gi with me.

326
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:38,258
Take me to the port.

327
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:54,459
Your grandma went downtown.
She'll be back soon.

328
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:00,256
Eun-gi, you draw so well.

329
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,468
My sister is also an artist.

330
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,888
Who are these people?

331
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:12,769
Me, Mom, Grandma, and Dad.

332
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,022
-What are you guys doing?
-Praying.

333
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:19,734
-Why?
-We're praying to the moons.

334
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,448
Why are there so many moons?

335
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:31,412
My dad knows a place
where there are 100 moons.

336
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:37,043
If you make 100 wishes there,
they all come true at once.

337
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:40,088
Really?

338
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,298
Do you have 100 wishes?

339
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:45,760
Why do you have so many wishes?
What's your biggest wish?

340
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,388
I want to be happy with my mom and dad.

341
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,058
What do you know about happiness?

342
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:55,812
It's what you feel
when you look at each other and smile.

343
00:30:58,231 --> 00:30:59,816
You really are full of surprises.

344
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:02,193
Eun-hui, did you hear what she said?

345
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:04,946
Happiness is what you feel
when you smile at each other.

346
00:31:10,451 --> 00:31:12,120
Don't drink in front of the kid.

347
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:17,083
Eun-gi, I'll help you draw.

348
00:31:19,586 --> 00:31:22,297
I'll draw a moon here.

349
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,884
And another one here.

350
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,543
Eun-gi is sleeping at Eun-hui's place.

351
00:32:00,627 --> 00:32:03,338
Eun-hui said
she'll bring her back tomorrow.

352
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,550
How's Man-su?

353
00:32:13,681 --> 00:32:16,851
He's on a ventilator.

354
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:21,606
He didn't even know I was there.

355
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:28,154
I can't believe I thought I'd be able
to live with my son.

356
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:33,785
I told Hae-seon

357
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:38,331
to just let Man-su die.

358
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:04,542
-It looks great.
-Right?

359
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,462
-Come on board.
-It's going to be a great day today.

360
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:08,963
Yes, come on.

361
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:10,882
All right. Get on the boat.

362
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,176
-Goodness.
-Goodness, come on board.

363
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,386
Let's get ready to go.

364
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:17,555
I love you.

365
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:25,021
Eun-gi, we'll bring you
some delicious abalones.

366
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,397
We'll bring a ton of them.

367
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:28,733
-I want conches.
-Okay, we'll bring conches.

368
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:32,904
Hurry up and go back to Mokpo
so your grandma can work again.

369
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:35,531
She hasn't made any money because of you.

370
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:38,159
Why would you
talk about money to a little kid?

371
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:41,370
Eun-gi, when are you going back?

372
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,164
The day after tomorrow.

373
00:34:43,706 --> 00:34:47,585
I slept here for 12 days,
so I'll be leaving in 2 more days.

374
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:51,714
-You must be excited.
-She's so adorable.

375
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:54,258
Be careful out there!

376
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,927
-All right.
-Bye.

377
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,515
Why are you late?
We couldn't go because of you!

378
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,934
-My husband's hungover.
-Hurry up.

379
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:04,477
-Unbelievable.
-You're so late.

380
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,562
-Bye.
-Bye.

381
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:07,730
See you.

382
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:09,857
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

383
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:24,080
Honey, it's time to eat.

384
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,874
You should use honorifics.

385
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,294
No, Mom doesn't use honorifics to Dad.

386
00:35:34,841 --> 00:35:37,218
-Goodness…
-Goodness, what do we do?

387
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,639
I feel so bad for Ms. Hyeon.

388
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,225
This is a special sauce.

389
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:46,102
-Special sauce.
-Poor Man-su…

390
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:47,979
Thank you for the meal.

391
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,981
And that poor kid.

392
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,569
Damn it…

393
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:03,327
I'll catch you.

394
00:36:39,447 --> 00:36:41,073
What's with the sea?

395
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,160
I know, right?

396
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:58,966
Gosh.

397
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,053
It's raining like crazy.

398
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:13,147
Eun-hui is really upset.

399
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,154
We should go to Mokpo

400
00:37:20,988 --> 00:37:23,282
and visit Man-su.

401
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,371
It'll only make me feel sad.

402
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,540
I'm not going.

403
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:38,965
My gosh.

404
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:41,634
Stop raining already!

405
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,803
Hey, you'll wake Eun-hui.

406
00:37:44,345 --> 00:37:45,805
She won't wake up.

407
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:29,093
All right.

408
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,848
Okay.

409
00:40:36,892 --> 00:40:41,147
There won't be any ferries or planes today
because of the rainstorm.

410
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:44,525
I'll get on a plane tomorrow morning
as soon as the rain stops.

411
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,877
Man-su wants to say goodbye.

412
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,671
He's in a critical state.

413
00:41:07,465 --> 00:41:09,884
The doctor said his family…

414
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,097
should get ready to say goodbye.

415
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:24,482
Due to the strong wind and waves,
no ship or plane will be available.

416
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,942
I'll go tomorrow morning.

417
00:41:27,776 --> 00:41:30,321
Eun-gi should get a chance
to say goodbye to her dad.

418
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,409
How could fate be so cruel?

419
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,289
Grandma, I'm done washing.

420
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:41,874
Eun-gi, come here.

421
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,000
Come on.

422
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,920
Goodness.

423
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:02,705
The weather in Jeju is
so damn temperamental.

424
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:05,457
This is getting scary.

425
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,636
What are you doing?

426
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:22,474
I'm drinking coffee at the abandoned house
as I watch the rainstorm.

427
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:23,559
You?

428
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:27,104
I'm drinking coffee by the office window,

429
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:30,899
enjoying the sunny view.

430
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,695
How's your treatment going?

431
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:38,991
Why did you call?

432
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,372
I…

433
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:47,916
I missed you.

434
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,924
Do you still miss me as a friend
or as a guy?

435
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:05,142
As a guy.

436
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:22,785
I'm done with the house.
I even sleep here sometimes.

437
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:24,953
It's pretty.

438
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,289
I did a pretty nice job.

439
00:44:30,834 --> 00:44:32,795
I plan to visit soon.

440
00:44:34,213 --> 00:44:36,548
-When?
-Maybe in about ten days?

441
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:39,426
Next weekend.

442
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,554
Are you coming
so you can jump into the sea again?

443
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,683
You'll freeze to death, you know.

444
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:47,518
The water gets cold in winter.

445
00:44:48,227 --> 00:44:49,978
I'll be going there to visit you.

446
00:44:51,438 --> 00:44:52,898
Not for any other reason.

447
00:44:57,945 --> 00:44:59,988
Okay. Let's hang up. I'm busy.

448
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:29,101
If you ever need me, just give me a call

449
00:45:29,184 --> 00:45:32,729
I'll run over to you whenever

450
00:45:33,647 --> 00:45:35,482
Whether it's during the day…

451
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:09,391
Who's that baby?

452
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,147
Do you not recognize yourself?

453
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:19,318
It's Mom and Dad.

454
00:46:23,697 --> 00:46:25,908
Who's that man?

455
00:46:29,244 --> 00:46:30,579
Your grandfather.

456
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,332
He looks so young.

457
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:35,792
He's dead.

458
00:46:37,961 --> 00:46:41,131
Our dog, Ppoppo, died too.

459
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:43,926
I was sad when Ppoppo died.

460
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:48,263
Who are those guys?

461
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,562
Your dad's older brothers.

462
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,773
They all got sick and died.

463
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:03,237
What about that guy?

464
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:10,410
He also got drunk,
fell into a furrow, and died.

465
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,130
Then I guess they all
turned into stars just like Ppoppo.

466
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,718
Dad told me that

467
00:47:26,802 --> 00:47:30,305
animals and humans
turn into stars after they die.

468
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,808
So he told me that
we don't need to feel sad.

469
00:47:34,643 --> 00:47:35,852
Nonsense.

470
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,982
We don't turn into stars.
We just turn into soil and dust.

471
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,442
When you're dead, it's over.

472
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,778
Don't believe what your dad says.

473
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,322
That's not true.

474
00:47:48,073 --> 00:47:51,702
Dad told me
we all turn into stars after we die.

475
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:55,038
Our dog, Ppoppo, also turned into a star.

476
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,124
He didn't turn into soil.

477
00:47:58,292 --> 00:47:59,835
What's so great about a star?

478
00:47:59,918 --> 00:48:01,628
You can't touch them

479
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,547
or hug them!

480
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,096
Your dad is a liar.

481
00:48:11,722 --> 00:48:14,182
He won't be able to get better.

482
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,143
He'll turn into soil.

483
00:48:16,643 --> 00:48:18,145
Don't believe your dad.

484
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:33,452
I hate you! My dad isn't a liar!

485
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:36,580
You're the one who's lying!

486
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:42,085
I'm going to tell my mom and dad
to come to pick me up!

487
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:46,548
I want to go today, not tomorrow!

488
00:48:46,632 --> 00:48:48,675
I want to go home right now!

489
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:18,914
You'll have to live with me now!

490
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:25,504
Your dad is going to turn into soil.
He won't get better.

491
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:31,301
I'll take care of you so that
your mom can live alone without you.

492
00:49:32,678 --> 00:49:36,348
Your mom and dad aren't coming.

493
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:38,016
No, that's not true!

494
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:42,104
He's not coming to Jeju
to become a fisherman.

495
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:45,691
He's not coming here to live with me.

496
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:52,239
He's not coming here to fetch you.

497
00:49:52,322 --> 00:49:54,908
They're all just lies!

498
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:59,579
I can't believe I thought
fate would be kind enough

499
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:03,375
to let me live with my son,
daughter-in-law, and granddaughter.

500
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:05,460
-I forgot I had a misfortunate life.
-Dad…

501
00:50:05,544 --> 00:50:07,170
-Please come pick me up.
-Man-su…

502
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:11,425
Man-su, my sweet son.

503
00:50:11,508 --> 00:50:14,136
Dad, come take me home.

504
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:16,888
He won't come
no matter how much you call him.

505
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:18,515
He's not coming.

506
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:22,602
-He won't come.
-Dad, please come take me home.

507
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,028
Just eat.

508
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:38,618
Your mom isn't going to pick up.

509
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:40,662
She's busy.

510
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,498
Eat your food.

511
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,376
-The number you have dialed…
-No.

512
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:50,630
I'm going to become a star
along with my dad!

513
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,466
I'm not going to eat!

514
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:54,926
I'm going to turn into soil,
just like you said!

515
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,220
Don't say that.

516
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,123
Hurry up and eat.

517
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,168
A hundred moons.

518
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,588
The hundred moons that grant our wishes.

519
00:51:32,964 --> 00:51:35,467
Instead of wishing for 100 things,

520
00:51:36,218 --> 00:51:39,930
I'm going to pray 100 times
so that my dad will recover.

521
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:44,726
Eat first.

522
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,814
Then we'll go see the 100 moons.

523
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:52,359
If you don't eat, I won't take you there.

524
00:51:56,404 --> 00:51:57,531
Come and eat.

525
00:52:15,549 --> 00:52:18,009
Eat slowly. Make sure you chew.

526
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:50,417
PUREUNG

527
00:52:53,670 --> 00:52:56,339
Listen. We can't sail right now.

528
00:52:56,923 --> 00:52:58,091
The boat will turn over.

529
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:00,427
-Come on.
-No way.

530
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,099
I feel so bad.

531
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,895
Just give up.
You can't sail with all that wind.

532
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,027
Makgeolli and grilled corvinas, please.

533
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:19,613
What's with the long face?

534
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:21,406
I'm trying to find a boat.

535
00:53:22,073 --> 00:53:23,074
What?

536
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:25,452
Captain Lee, where are you right now?

537
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:27,704
I called to ask for a favor. Yes.

538
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,665
What is he saying?
Why does he need a boat?

539
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:32,792
Don't ask. He won't listen.

540
00:53:38,089 --> 00:53:41,968
Hey, you punk.
Think of all the stuff I did for you.

541
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:47,557
I always do you favors,
so why can't you do one for me?

542
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:50,477
Unbelievable.

543
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:54,773
Why is there always something wrong
with your boat, you fool?

544
00:53:57,817 --> 00:53:59,819
Why are you guys just sitting there?

545
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,864
Make calls to see if we can get a boat.

546
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:03,782
Come on.

547
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:07,535
We can't ask our friends
to sail in this rain.

548
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:11,498
Ms. Hyeon said the rain is
going to stop soon.

549
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,500
Does that look like it's going to stop?

550
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,418
What do you know?

551
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,671
Ms. Hyeon knows better than you.

552
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:21,466
If she says it'll stop,
it means it'll stop.

553
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:25,136
Ms. Hyeon said it'll stop raining soon!

554
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:26,221
Look at the sky!

555
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,437
You can tell by the lightning
that it's going to stop soon.

556
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:37,023
Hurry up and find a boat.

557
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:38,817
Call everyone you know.

558
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:41,695
Listen.

559
00:54:42,904 --> 00:54:44,572
That won't bring Ma-su back.

560
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:46,574
All right?

561
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,411
If that can save Man-su,

562
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:52,288
I'd go ahead and gather a hundred boats.

563
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:03,299
If Man-su doesn't live
even after we gather the boats,

564
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:05,885
Eun-gi will be disappointed.

565
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,555
I don't want to see that.

566
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,433
Eun-hui, I agree.

567
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:13,810
You're wasting your time.

568
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:16,521
Do you think I haven't thought about that?

569
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,400
Eun-hui, I'm just saying that
it might end up disappointing Eun-gi.

570
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:22,819
Let's worry about that later.
Eun-hui, I'm going to sail.

571
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:24,154
Captain Park is coming too.

572
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,239
Bring Ms. Hyeon and Ms. Kang
to the highland.

573
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,620
Fine.

574
00:55:33,121 --> 00:55:35,957
Don't bother wasting your time.
Just stay here and drink.

575
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:39,335
Meanwhile, I don't think
I can stay here and do nothing.

576
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,379
So I'd rather waste my time doing this.

577
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:43,298
Hey.

578
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,721
Where is Captain Park off to?

579
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:01,483
-What?
-Come outside.

580
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:05,278
Sail your boat.

581
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:07,113
What? Why do you want me to…

582
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:08,907
-Hey, wait.
-Come on.

583
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:15,747
Ms. Hyeon, you were right.

584
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,874
It stopped raining.

585
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:21,961
I can't believe we're doing this.

586
00:56:24,005 --> 00:56:26,382
We pray to the rocks piled up by the road,

587
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:29,594
and we even pray to the dark sea.

588
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:32,514
So why not the lights?

589
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,976
Pray for Man-su's life
in return for yours.

590
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,774
I prayed that thousands of times.

591
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,736
Every time one of my children died.

592
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:49,989
It'll work this time.

593
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,910
The skies will be touched
by your sincerity.

594
00:57:00,208 --> 00:57:03,378
Eun-gi, are you excited
about seeing 100 moons?

595
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,840
-Yes.
-My goodness.

596
00:57:11,302 --> 00:57:12,720
Be careful, ladies.

597
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:27,861
Eun-gi.

598
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:32,115
You're doing well.
Should I carry you on my back?

599
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:37,287
Ladies, be careful of that rock.

600
00:58:07,150 --> 00:58:08,776
Hey, Captain Bae.

601
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,779
This seems like a waste of time.

602
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,573
I know.

603
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:16,743
I'll treat you to alcohol next time.

604
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:18,786
Hey!

605
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,997
You're here too?

606
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,043
Jeong-jun and Eun-hui kept saying
it was for Ms. Hyeon!

607
00:58:25,126 --> 00:58:26,961
I had no other choice!

608
00:58:27,712 --> 00:58:28,922
Well, go on.

609
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:31,925
Ho-sik and Captain Yang are here too.
You saw them, right?

610
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,134
Yes, I did.

611
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:03,873
Let's keep going.

612
00:59:10,755 --> 00:59:12,131
We're almost there.

613
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:35,863
Come on.

614
01:00:46,934 --> 01:00:48,936
Dad…

615
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:52,106
It's true.

616
01:00:52,774 --> 01:00:56,903
There really are 100 moons.

617
01:00:58,446 --> 01:01:01,699
You were right, Dad.

618
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:08,039
There really are 100 moons.

619
01:01:33,773 --> 01:01:38,653
Dad, please don't be sick.

620
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:44,867
Dad, don't be sick.

621
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,039
RESTRICTED AREA

622
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:58,172
Dad, don't be sick.

623
01:01:59,799 --> 01:02:04,137
Please come take me home.

624
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:07,890
I promise I'll be good.

625
01:02:20,361 --> 01:02:21,529
Man-su.

626
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:24,991
Come back.

627
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:31,748
Dad, don't be sick.

628
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:35,376
Dad…

629
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,337
Don't be sick.

630
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,188
Dad…

631
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:34,101
UNITY

632
01:03:55,414 --> 01:03:58,918
Your mom has cancer. It's terminal.

633
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:00,586
Let's board the morning ship.

634
01:04:00,670 --> 01:04:02,755
-Does having cancer make you entitled?
-Come here.

635
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:05,383
Give Dong-seok a cup of coffee.

636
01:04:05,466 --> 01:04:08,344
How can she expect me
to be a good son after all this damn time?

637
01:04:08,427 --> 01:04:09,971
What do you mean? Isn't it too soon?

638
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:12,014
She's due next month!

639
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:14,141
How can you call yourself human?

640
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,893
Do you know why
I've never considered getting married

641
01:04:15,977 --> 01:04:17,854
to the women I dated so far?

642
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:21,607
Because I was afraid that
they'd turn out to be like my mom.

643
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:24,360
Just give in. Take her to Mokpo.

644
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,905
You can put an end
to your ill-fated relationship.

645
01:04:28,823 --> 01:04:30,700
Fine. Let's see what she has to say.

646
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:37,498
