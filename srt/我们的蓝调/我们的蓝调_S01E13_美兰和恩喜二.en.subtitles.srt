1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,112
MI-RAN AND EUN-HUI

2
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,363
LOYALTY, THREE GOODBYES,
AURORAS IN ICELAND, YOU KNOW, EUN-HUI

3
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,978
MI-RAN AND EUN-HUI 2

4
00:01:03,772 --> 00:01:05,607
-Oh, gosh.
-Why did you drink so much?

5
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,900
-Open the door.
-So funny.

6
00:01:06,983 --> 00:01:09,402
-Oh, wait. Careful.
-I got her.

7
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:10,820
-Mi-ran.
-Hey.

8
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,822
-Watch the doorsill.
-Just one more drink!

9
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,491
-Your bed is right there.
-Just one more.

10
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:15,825
-Come on.
-Just a second.

11
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,660
This way. Lay her down.

12
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:20,538
-Today was so much fun.
-Okay, let's put her down.

13
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,666
-Oh, gosh.
-This is hilarious.

14
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:35,345
What's her deal?

15
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:39,808
She's like this when she's drunk.
It's the alcohol.

16
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:41,559
Can you bring me a wet towel?

17
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,636
Seriously?

18
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:18,346
You're even singing her a lullaby?

19
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,643
Are you asleep?

20
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:25,854
Are you sleeping?

21
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:28,940
Hey.

22
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,151
Take off her socks for me.

23
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,830
Let's take your jacket off.

24
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,083
Your right arm.

25
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,718
She laughs, cries, then sleeps.

26
00:02:58,469 --> 00:03:00,221
She's unbelievable.

27
00:03:02,181 --> 00:03:03,975
Speak for yourself.

28
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,270
You treat your friend
like she's your boss or parent.

29
00:03:08,187 --> 00:03:09,397
You've done enough.

30
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,357
Just go to bed.

31
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,321
You really are like her maid.

32
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,061
Eun-hui.

33
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:33,564
Although Mi-ran is a horrible,

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,069
selfish, two-faced brat
who thinks of you as nothing

35
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:41,906
but a pathetic pushover
that she can boss around

36
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,701
however she likes…

37
00:04:44,784 --> 00:04:45,910
Water…

38
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,496
I need water.

39
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:55,086
Water.

40
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,798
Water…

41
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:03,636
Come on.

42
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,471
Try to sit up.

43
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,473
Here you go.

44
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:15,440
Thank you.

45
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:21,821
Eun-hui, I still want you
to stay loyal to Mi-ran until the end.

46
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:26,326
Don't let it show that she hurt you.
Just do your very best.

47
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:30,246
Let's repay her
for all that she's done for me.

48
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,665
And let's make sure I never become

49
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,462
a selfish and two-faced jerk like Mi-ran.

50
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:42,383
That's all you need to focus on, Eun-hui.

51
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,068
All done.

52
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:03,196
Let's eat.

53
00:06:04,822 --> 00:06:06,199
Thank you for the food.

54
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,456
It's delicious.

55
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:14,916
-I cooked it well, right?
-Yes.

56
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,169
-Do you want water?
-Yes, please.

57
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:24,342
Gosh. Be quiet!

58
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:26,177
Sorry.

59
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:31,557
Thanks.

60
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,644
-Isn't it too spicy?
-No, it tastes good.

61
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,400
It's 3 a.m.

62
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,030
And you're eating ramyeon?

63
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,742
Yes.

64
00:06:51,577 --> 00:06:53,412
The baby craved it.

65
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,752
It's like you live here.

66
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,674
The baby missed him.

67
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:05,925
So fussy, right?

68
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:15,226
Mr. Bang…

69
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,020
I mean, father. We must've woken you up.

70
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,691
-Why don't we eat in your room?
-Sure.

71
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,118
-Good night, Dad.
-Sorry, sir.

72
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,711
It tastes so good.

73
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,671
Hyeon, you should open a ramyeon joint.

74
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,630
-Should I?
-Yes.

75
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,048
Good, right?

76
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,341
-Yes.
-I made it with love.

77
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:49,802
Unbelievable.

78
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,108
Dad, where are you going?

79
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,570
Enjoy eating ramyeon with your husband!

80
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,240
Where's Hyeon's room?

81
00:08:14,869 --> 00:08:15,786
Over there.

82
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:46,651
I'm sorry, Mi-ran.
About Ji-yun's graduation trip…

83
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,697
It'll just be me, Ji-yun's mother,
Ji-yun, and her boyfriend, David.

84
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:55,159
I'm Ji-yun's mother. Wake up.

85
00:08:56,285 --> 00:09:00,289
Right. Ji-yun's stepmother, Sophie.
It'll just have to be the four of us.

86
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,041
Is this what Ji-yun wants?

87
00:09:02,124 --> 00:09:04,335
-Was this your idea?
-No, it was Ji-yun's.

88
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:08,756
She wanted me to tell you instead
because she felt bad.

89
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,425
Let's be honest. Sophie raised her.

90
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,970
I raised her
until she finished middle school.

91
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:17,348
Sophie raised her since high school.
It's only been seven years.

92
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:19,600
Let's be precise here.

93
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:31,028
I can’t answer the phone right now.

94
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,613
Please leave a message.

95
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,499
Hey, Ji-yun. It's me.

96
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,919
Your dad told me everything.

97
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:53,009
But I hope we still get to go
to Iceland together to see auroras.

98
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,514
I can compromise with everything else
except for that.

99
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,476
You're my daughter,

100
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,895
and I really want to be…

101
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,947
the person to show you
the beautiful auroras.

102
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:20,077
Not with your dad, Sophie,
or your boyfriend. Just with me.

103
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:24,081
I just want it to be us two.

104
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,712
Text me, okay?

105
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:35,468
Let me know when you're free
to go to Iceland with me.

106
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,765
Your message has been recorded.

107
00:10:58,532 --> 00:11:00,159
Jeju!

108
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:07,249
Jeju!

109
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,088
Ko Mi-ran…

110
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,383
is back!

111
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,056
Have you been well?

112
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:27,228
It's been so long!

113
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,065
Hey!

114
00:12:00,928 --> 00:12:03,431
Gosh, Eun-hui.

115
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,311
She still has the curtains
I gave her ten years ago.

116
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,442
I knew it.

117
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:18,863
Which is why I brought something for her.

118
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,372
My goodness.

119
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:46,640
Bestie, did you sleep well?
I'm off to the auction site.

120
00:12:46,724 --> 00:12:48,809
Sorry I couldn't have breakfast with you.

121
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:50,352
But I can do lunch.

122
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,438
I'll see you later. Loyalty!

123
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,503
EUN-HUI'S DIARY, 9TH GRADE
EUN-HUI'S SECRET NOTEBOOK, 8TH GRADE

124
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,755
MY SECRET NOTEBOOK
SECOND DIARY OF 2020, EUN-HUI

125
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:05,302
Well,

126
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:07,972
we don't keep secrets from each other.

127
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:12,726
EUN-HUI'S DIARY, 9TH GRADE

128
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:30,160
Today, Mi-ran gave me a ride again
because I didn't have my bus fare.

129
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,955
The other kids were super jealous.

130
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:36,959
Some kids make fun of me
and call me Mi-ran's slave.

131
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:41,130
Jeez. What kind of jerk
would say that to my dear Eun-hui?

132
00:14:42,089 --> 00:14:45,551
Some kids say
Mi-ran treats me like a maid.

133
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,845
Gosh, I'm starting to get angry.

134
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,598
But I know they only say that
because they're jealous

135
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,142
of how close I am with Mi-ran.

136
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,146
After all, Mi-ran adores me.
She thinks I'm the cutest

137
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,608
and funniest person in this entire world.

138
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,571
EUN-HUI'S STORIES

139
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:24,548
What?

140
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,176
I wonder if this is also a diary.

141
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:38,187
"The hairtails were extremely fresh today,
so they got sold out before noon."

142
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,606
"Thanks to that,

143
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:46,320
the butterfish and white croakers
sold really well too."

144
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:50,574
"No matter the price, it's always best
to buy good quality fish."

145
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,953
"And once again,
I promise myself to do so."

146
00:16:03,671 --> 00:16:06,131
Today, I fought with In-gwon.

147
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:09,426
He keeps asking me
when Mi-ran's coming like a crazy person.

148
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,554
I was upset that
the mackerels weren't selling,

149
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,306
but he just had to make it worse.

150
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:24,900
I guess she sold
a lot of hairtails this day.

151
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:27,611
Croakers…

152
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,367
And this day, she sold a lot of croakers.

153
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:39,957
Gosh, this is more like
a sales log than a diary.

154
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:46,964
She lives such a hard-working life.

155
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,633
I'm so proud of her.

156
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:56,557
The everlasting star of Pureung.
My best friend.

157
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,601
Ko Mi-ran has returned to Pureung
after three years.

158
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:01,687
This is from yesterday.

159
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:04,690
"Whenever she's here,

160
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,736
everyone is elated,
and they all love her."

161
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:14,575
"Whenever Ms. Kang sees her,

162
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,204
she adores her
as if she's her late daughter, Dong-i."

163
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,873
"Ms. Hyeon's late son,

164
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:24,918
Man-yeong, who died
after falling into a furrow drunk,

165
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,964
used to be in love with Mi-ran."

166
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,677
"Ms. Hyeon's heart breaks since she
considers Mi-ran her daughter-in-law."

167
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:37,222
But what about me?

168
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:43,145
I always say Mi-ran's my best friend,
but is she really?

169
00:17:43,812 --> 00:17:45,397
Do I think of her as a friend?

170
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:49,610
Do I also miss her
and feel happy when I see her?

171
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:53,113
SS BANK

172
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:00,370
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

173
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:07,628
Eun-hui, the gathering is
at 5 p.m. tonight on the island, right?

174
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:12,466
If you're too busy with work,

175
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,886
I'll go pick Mi-ran up
after I get off work.

176
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,387
Why would you do that?

177
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,601
You didn't even have time
to go shopping for my mom's clothes.

178
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:26,855
In-jeong, take your husband with you
and go buy some clothes for your mother.

179
00:18:27,815 --> 00:18:30,818
Get your act straight.
Your wife has you by the balls.

180
00:18:31,777 --> 00:18:34,363
-In-jeong, see you later on the island.
-Bye.

181
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:49,336
-Where are you going?
-I have afternoon harvesting.

182
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:52,089
I see. Be careful.
Harvesting in the afternoon is tough.

183
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:53,215
See you.

184
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:02,474
Eun-hui. Although Mi-ran is a horrible,

185
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,477
selfish, two-faced brat
who thinks of you as nothing

186
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:09,273
but a pathetic pushover
that she can boss around

187
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:12,109
however she likes…

188
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:16,572
Eun-hui, I still want you
to stay loyal to Mi-ran until the end.

189
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,741
Don't let it show that she hurt you.
Just do your very best.

190
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:23,871
Let's repay her
for all that she's done for me.

191
00:19:23,954 --> 00:19:25,914
And let's make sure I never become

192
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,835
a selfish and two-faced jerk like Mi-ran.

193
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:33,088
That's all you need to focus on, Eun-hui.

194
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,131
I'm back.

195
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,676
Hey, you're here.

196
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:40,262
What's this smell?

197
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:43,098
Hey, what…

198
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,061
Out of the way.

199
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,648
-Out of the way.
-Jeez.

200
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,734
Did you forget that this was on the stove?

201
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:55,944
It's okay.

202
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,030
It's fine as long as you're okay.

203
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,951
What's this?

204
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,828
Did you do all this?

205
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,455
Do you like it?

206
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,999
Of course. I love it.

207
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:11,418
Gosh, let me see…

208
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:12,336
Wait.

209
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,631
You even cleaned the room.

210
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,300
It's like a hotel!

211
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,969
Did you clean the bathroom too?

212
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,392
This is amazing. It's squeaky clean.

213
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,979
Gosh, you brat.

214
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,316
I adore you so much.

215
00:20:35,859 --> 00:20:37,903
-Loyalty.
-Loyalty.

216
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:39,863
Go wash up.

217
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,531
-I'll fix lunch.
-Okay.

218
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:42,824
I stink, don't I?

219
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,538
I'll be right out.

220
00:21:28,078 --> 00:21:30,998
I can't believe I'm going through this
with a friend at this age.

221
00:21:36,169 --> 00:21:37,629
Don't let it show.

222
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,049
Just keep treating her the same way.

223
00:22:07,075 --> 00:22:08,243
Get out of the car.

224
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:11,955
But it's time for harvesting.

225
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,231
Where are Ms. Hyeon and the other ladies?

226
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,776
Dal-i took them.

227
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,070
Oh, I see.

228
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,324
I came ten minutes early,

229
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,868
but I guess everyone came earlier.

230
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,415
A few days back,

231
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,128
Ms. Hyeon told me that
there was something I needed to know.

232
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:04,132
She told me everything you told her.

233
00:23:07,052 --> 00:23:08,178
I see.

234
00:23:11,973 --> 00:23:13,225
Drink this.

235
00:23:28,698 --> 00:23:31,409
Ms. Hyeon and I are
very loyal to each other.

236
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,495
Even more loyal
than thugs are to each other.

237
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:38,375
She asked me to keep it to myself,

238
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:43,755
so if you choose not to tell anyone else,
I won't say a word either.

239
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:51,138
The other haenyeos will do
as Ms. Hyeon and I say.

240
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,392
Now that I know your story,

241
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:59,980
I get why you kept risking your life
to make so much money.

242
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,066
My grandchild…

243
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,238
is like that too.

244
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,974
People don't talk about it,

245
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:38,977
but there are many families like ours.

246
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,228
It's no big deal.

247
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:49,237
Starting from today,
you're going to be my partner.

248
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,239
Dal-i will be partners with Ms. Hyeon.

249
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,534
From now on, you'd better do as I say.

250
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,537
Harvest one abalone at a time

251
00:24:57,621 --> 00:24:59,623
and one sea urchin at a time.

252
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,751
If you try to get two at once,
I swear I'll kill you.

253
00:25:03,627 --> 00:25:05,879
-Okay.
-Wipe that smile off your face.

254
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,089
My life is in your hands now.
Be on your toes.

255
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,716
Okay.

256
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:12,427
Don't act up
thinking Ms. Hyeon has your back.

257
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:15,138
From now on, you answer to me.

258
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,432
I'm your boss. You got that?

259
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,018
All right, boss.

260
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,897
-Start driving.
-Okay.

261
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:30,487
Hey, slow down. Drive slowly.

262
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,037
Apply this?

263
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:43,667
-Hey.
-What?

264
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,168
That's not how you do it.

265
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:52,050
At our age, it's essential that
we take care of our wrinkles.

266
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,595
You should wear stuff like this.

267
00:25:56,805 --> 00:25:59,349
What's the point?
It'd be like a pig wearing makeup.

268
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:03,144
You're right.

269
00:26:04,354 --> 00:26:06,356
At least you know that you're a pig.

270
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:08,483
You little brat.

271
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,277
Close your eyes.

272
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:15,907
So don't ever

273
00:26:16,825 --> 00:26:19,786
call yourself a pig again.
You're as beautiful as a bird.

274
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:23,206
You're sexier than a lioness.

275
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,582
Stop joking around.

276
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:28,003
I'm not joking.

277
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:30,213
You're…

278
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:35,302
Eun-hui. Let's make sure I never become

279
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:39,264
a selfish and two-faced jerk like Mi-ran.

280
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,809
I'm what?

281
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,020
Tell me.

282
00:26:50,066 --> 00:26:52,110
-Eun-hui.
-Yes?

283
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,573
By any chance,

284
00:26:58,658 --> 00:27:01,661
did I ever upset you?

285
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,456
No.

286
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,835
Come on. Tell me.

287
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,133
I'm a bit immature,
so I can seem selfish at times.

288
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,470
Even yesterday,

289
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,766
I told you not to make
a big deal about selling fish

290
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,977
and that I'd buy that all.

291
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,356
Didn't that

292
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,566
hurt you?

293
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:36,988
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.
We're friends.

294
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:43,953
Friends can hurt each other too.

295
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:47,457
But it's just that

296
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,502
you're always working too hard.

297
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:55,173
I only said that
hoping you'd let go and have fun.

298
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:59,052
If that bothered you by any chance,

299
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:01,679
-I'd like to apologize.
-Jeez.

300
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,099
It's fine. Just finish doing my makeup.

301
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:12,774
Eun-hui.

302
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,819
I'm not perfect.

303
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:21,783
So there may be times
when I unintentionally hurt you.

304
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,995
But I really like you.

305
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:31,835
Eun-hui.

306
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,587
Are you sure

307
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:37,674
I never did anything to hurt you?

308
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,513
If you tell me,
I'll apologize no matter what.

309
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,850
Gosh. No, you haven't done anything wrong.

310
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,317
Are you done with the makeup?

311
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,653
Can I open my eyes?

312
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:00,905
Yes.

313
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,912
Goodness. Who is this woman?

314
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,415
The woman I see in the mirror
isn't Jung Eun-hui.

315
00:29:11,332 --> 00:29:14,878
Ji-yun got me this necklace as a gift.

316
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,966
These two women are us.

317
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:25,138
It's very precious to me,
so make sure you give it back.

318
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:27,557
Today, you can wear it.

319
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:32,562
Let me see. It's pretty.

320
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,149
We should go. We'll be late.

321
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,318
-Eun-hui.
-Yes?

322
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,073
-I love you.
-I love you too.

323
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,414
A lot of people will be there.

324
00:29:52,207 --> 00:29:55,084
Let's enjoy this day like it's the last.

325
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:57,504
Let's have a blast today.

326
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:00,799
Let's drink like a fish,

327
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,926
sing duet songs like we used to,

328
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,594
-and scream and shout.
-Loyalty!

329
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,638
Loyalty.

330
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:43,591
Just leave me

331
00:30:43,675 --> 00:30:47,595
There's nothing I can do for you

332
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,557
Leave my side

333
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,018
Go find someone who can make you happy

334
00:30:54,853 --> 00:31:00,692
I'm sorry I can't hold your hand
And ask you to stay

335
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,820
I just can't hold onto you
Just because I love you…

336
00:31:03,903 --> 00:31:06,906
-Mi-ran, stop drinking.
-Hey.

337
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:09,075
-Stop it.
-I am a fool

338
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,412
You're the reason I live

339
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:14,372
What? What's wrong, Myeong-bo?

340
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:16,666
-I'm sorry that I don't have what it takes
-Nothing. It's nothing.

341
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,459
Just drink.

342
00:31:18,543 --> 00:31:21,462
Forgive me for being such a coward

343
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,424
I can't be happy without you

344
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:25,550
What is it?

345
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,969
I need to go to the men's room.

346
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,888
What's with your bladder?

347
00:31:29,971 --> 00:31:31,681
You're always off to the men's room.

348
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,142
Let's never break up again

349
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:37,937
-I can't be happy without you
-Pour me a glass.

350
00:31:38,521 --> 00:31:41,149
You're the only person who can have me

351
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,317
Mi-ran.

352
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:46,321
You'd better not flirt with my husband.

353
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,364
Unbelievable.

354
00:31:49,157 --> 00:31:50,158
Listen.

355
00:31:50,825 --> 00:31:53,494
I have really high standards, you know.

356
00:31:53,578 --> 00:31:56,331
Gosh, what do you take me for?

357
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:02,879
Don't you worry.

358
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,423
I would never be attracted
to your husband.

359
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,969
Let's drink. Drink up.

360
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:15,433
That was good.

361
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:17,894
Hey, wait!

362
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:21,689
Do you guys remember the legendary duo?

363
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,358
-Of course!
-All right!

364
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:25,068
Ko Mi-ran!

365
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,444
Get up on stage!

366
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,614
-Come on!
-Ko Mi-ran!

367
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,242
-Ko Mi-ran!
-Ko Mi-ran!

368
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:36,371
-Ko Mi-ran!
-Ko Mi-ran!

369
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:39,332
-Ko Mi-ran!
-Ko Mi-ran!

370
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:13,074
The sound of the night birds

371
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,159
Sounds so sad

372
00:33:15,785 --> 00:33:21,374
The moon up in the night sky
Looks so lonely

373
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:25,420
The whispers coming from the stars

374
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:27,839
Are all meaningless

375
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:31,634
The warm past

376
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:34,887
Gets buried in the darkness

377
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:40,351
And now it seems like
We mean nothing to each other

378
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:43,896
The dream-like past

379
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:47,358
Disappears in the fog

380
00:33:47,442 --> 00:33:53,197
And now I'm left here all alone

381
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:56,492
Tonight

382
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,370
The darkness scares me

383
00:33:59,454 --> 00:34:05,251
The sound of the night birds sounds so sad

384
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:09,338
-Ko Mi-ran!
-Ko Mi-ran!

385
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:16,763
-Ko Mi-ran!
-Ko Mi-ran!

386
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,807
Guys, I'm back!

387
00:34:19,891 --> 00:34:25,104
The warm past gets buried in the darkness

388
00:34:25,188 --> 00:34:28,149
Is your job as a maid finally over?

389
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:30,693
Cut the joke.

390
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,321
Eun-hui.

391
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:39,160
I bet you're nice to Mi-ran
because you feel inferior to her.

392
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,829
You're just trying not to show it.

393
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:44,874
Eun-hui!

394
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,296
She'll always be the princess,
and you'll always be her maid.

395
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,715
Do you know what Mi-ran…

396
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:56,636
Damn it. Do you know
what that vixen said to me earlier?

397
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:01,099
I told her not to flirt with Myeong-bo,

398
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:03,601
and she told me that
she has high standards.

399
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:05,478
That she'd never be attracted to him.

400
00:35:05,978 --> 00:35:08,064
Do you know what that means?

401
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:12,735
It means that brat thinks every one of us
including you, Myeong-bo, In-gwon, and I

402
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,489
aren't good enough
to even be on her level.

403
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:21,619
It means she looks down on us
and thinks we're lowlives.

404
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:27,333
Everyone who's here is Mi-ran's servant.

405
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:29,502
Looks so lonely…

406
00:35:29,585 --> 00:35:33,506
I'm so disappointed in Mi-ran.

407
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,511
I get that you're upset,
but she's older than you.

408
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:40,721
Have some respect.

409
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,976
Plus, that's just how she is.

410
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,562
There's no need to be disappointed.

411
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,648
Just set the bar low,
and you're good to go.

412
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,818
Mi-ran's leaving tomorrow anyway.

413
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:55,736
Drink up.

414
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,489
-Drink.
-Gosh.

415
00:35:59,615 --> 00:36:01,284
Bottoms up. Damn it.

416
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,078
Tonight…

417
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,955
Just ten minutes

418
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,416
That's all it takes to make you mine

419
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:13,379
Guys always get fooled by the naive act

420
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,382
But baby,
I bet you're falling for something new…

421
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,844
Hello.

422
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:22,638
The Korean alphabet poster…

423
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:41,657
I'll take these two.

424
00:36:42,450 --> 00:36:43,826
That'll be 20,000 won.

425
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,626
Here you go.

426
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,087
-Here.
-Thank you. Bye.

427
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,214
Bye.

428
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:23,366
You seem awfully sentimental.

429
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:26,786
They're for Ms. Kang.

430
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,456
I figured I might forget
after a few more shots.

431
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,807
Why are you drinking here alone?

432
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,606
Myeong-bo.

433
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,067
What's wrong?

434
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,444
Mi-ran.

435
00:38:01,487 --> 00:38:04,031
I'm going to break up with In-jeong.

436
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,248
Hey.

437
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,166
In-jeong is a great girl.

438
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,252
She's nice to your parents.

439
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:19,880
Your kid even went to college
with top grades thanks to her.

440
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,049
I mean, come on.

441
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,218
You're crazy for wanting a divorce.

442
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:33,436
Here's a word of advice
from someone who's been divorced before.

443
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:36,731
It's better to talk things out
and stay married.

444
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:44,780
Jeez.

445
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:53,748
What about this?

446
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:56,917
It's a little red.

447
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,381
Now, look at my back.

448
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,274
What happened?

449
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:25,321
She stepped on my left foot
wearing heels quite some time ago.

450
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:29,283
And as for this,

451
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,620
she did it
because I looked at you earlier.

452
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:38,167
In-jeong has delusional jealousy.

453
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:46,133
She's been physically abusing me.

454
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,846
I put up with it until now,

455
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,809
but I can't do it anymore.

456
00:39:56,602 --> 00:39:57,561
Goodness.

457
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,940
I'm so sorry, Myeong-bo.

458
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:04,985
I can't believe
you had to go through that.

459
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:09,073
I feel so bad for you, buddy.

460
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:12,493
Come on. Don't cry.

461
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:14,870
Gosh, poor you.

462
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,373
Hey.

463
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,751
Hey! What's your problem?

464
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,087
Get off of her! Let her go, woman!

465
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,296
Let go of her!

466
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,132
-Let go. Let's talk it out.
-Let go!

467
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:27,341
You little…

468
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,093
You go around
hitting on every man you see!

469
00:40:29,176 --> 00:40:30,553
Stop it!

470
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:33,389
-Don't cross the line. Let go of my hair.
-Please stop!

471
00:40:33,472 --> 00:40:34,932
I'm not letting go, you brat.

472
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,308
Weren't mainland men enough?

473
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:38,686
Did you have to flirt with my husband too?

474
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,979
You crazy little…

475
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,691
-In-jeong, please just stop!
-Get off!

476
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,238
I told you to stop!

477
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:52,158
Mi-ran, wait. Mi-ran…

478
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,577
-Damn you!
-Get off me!

479
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:57,288
-You damn little…
-Will you please stop?

480
00:40:57,371 --> 00:40:58,831
-Hey!
-Stop it!

481
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,291
What's going on here?

482
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:02,710
-That's enough!
-What do you think you're doing?

483
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:05,754
-Let go. Let go of her.
-Enough! Stop!

484
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:08,841
-Get off me!
-Let go of her! Let go!

485
00:41:08,924 --> 00:41:10,134
What's with you?

486
00:41:17,683 --> 00:41:19,518
Hey!

487
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:22,855
Honey.

488
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:25,733
Myeong-bo, she just kicked me.

489
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:29,904
Myeong-bo! Honey!

490
00:41:30,529 --> 00:41:31,530
Damn it!

491
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:05,481
BANG FAMILY ICE

492
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:07,483
Hey, you just disappeared.

493
00:42:08,025 --> 00:42:09,527
Are you on your way to Eun-hui's?

494
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:12,029
Why didn't you stay for longer?

495
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,573
Didn't you drink?

496
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:18,494
For whose own good?
I have to get up at dawn for work.

497
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:21,705
I'm not well-off like you are.

498
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,000
Hop in.

499
00:42:45,854 --> 00:42:46,981
Why…

500
00:42:48,774 --> 00:42:50,150
do you hate me?

501
00:42:52,486 --> 00:42:54,154
I don't hate you.

502
00:42:55,281 --> 00:42:56,615
Yes, you do.

503
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,034
I could always tell.

504
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,288
Ever since we were young,

505
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:04,665
you never liked me.

506
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:09,336
Everyone else loves you.
Isn't that good enough?

507
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,715
Do you need love and attention
from everyone you know?

508
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,174
That's narcissism, you know.

509
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,720
What made you hate me?

510
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:24,310
If you think of me as a friend at all,
tell me why you hate me.

511
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,236
Fine. Only because we're friends.

512
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:37,865
I've hated you for quite some time now.

513
00:43:38,574 --> 00:43:39,950
It started in high school.

514
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:44,038
It was when Eun-hui didn't
bring lunch to school.

515
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:48,500
So like always,
she ended up sharing yours.

516
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:54,089
But I guess Eun-hui was
craving sausages that day.

517
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:58,344
Jeez. See? I was right, wasn't I?

518
00:43:58,427 --> 00:44:00,429
-Okay, I get it.
-Get what?

519
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,847
Mi-ran is a horrible brat.

520
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,266
Gosh, you're heavy. Stand up straight.

521
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:08,979
She hugged my husband
and caressed his cheeks.

522
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:14,276
She looked at him seductively
with her hands on his cheeks.

523
00:44:15,235 --> 00:44:19,073
Don't be absurd.
Mi-ran would never touch him like that.

524
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:22,660
Then are you saying I'm lying?

525
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,496
No, that's not what I meant.

526
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:29,541
Mi-ran is always flirting
with any guy she can find.

527
00:44:29,625 --> 00:44:31,710
Not every woman gets married three times.

528
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:34,254
Hey! Then was she supposed
to stay with the cheating husband,

529
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:36,215
or the guy who started a secret business,

530
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:39,343
or the guy who wanted babies
when she was going through menopause?

531
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,761
Yes, she should've stayed!

532
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:44,014
Once you're married, you stay married.

533
00:44:44,682 --> 00:44:49,853
Mi-ran just can't help herself.
It's in her blood to flirt with men.

534
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:51,647
Am I right or wrong?

535
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:55,651
Okay, fine. You're right. Now, let's go.

536
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,695
-You just admitted that Mi-ran's a brat.
-Yes, sure.

537
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:01,448
I get it already.
Now, at least walk properly.

538
00:45:02,449 --> 00:45:04,118
Hey, don't just stand there.

539
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:05,953
Come help me with your wife.

540
00:45:06,829 --> 00:45:09,915
Hey, why did you disappear earlier?

541
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:11,291
Did you leave with Mi-ran?

542
00:45:11,875 --> 00:45:14,169
-Hey…
-Don't you hear me?

543
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,339
Honey!

544
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:18,757
Hey.

545
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:22,678
-They're unbelievable.
-I'm drunk. Carry me on your back.

546
00:45:22,761 --> 00:45:24,012
This is so exhausting.

547
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:25,097
Hey!

548
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,318
Crazy brat.

549
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,863
Shallow brat.

550
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:25,073
You're still drinking?

551
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,580
Would you like some?

552
00:46:32,706 --> 00:46:34,291
No, thanks. I don't have time.

553
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:48,847
Are you addicted to making money?

554
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:11,286
You make a decent living,
but you're still so obsessed with money.

555
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:12,746
All you ever do is work.

556
00:47:14,081 --> 00:47:18,919
I wouldn't call that
hard-working and diligent.

557
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:22,005
You're just a workaholic.

558
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,138
It's better than being an alcoholic.

559
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,767
I don't drink that much.

560
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:44,278
I'm not addicted to alcohol,

561
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:47,489
but I am addicted to men.

562
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,701
But of course, you know that.

563
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,622
What are you talking about?

564
00:48:00,002 --> 00:48:02,045
In-jeong just called me.

565
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:06,258
My phone automatically records
all my phone conversations.

566
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,678
Would you like to hear it?

567
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:16,268
In the beginning, she just keeps cursing.

568
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:18,228
What you need to hear

569
00:48:19,855 --> 00:48:21,565
starts about here.

570
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,650
Why would I be with your husband?

571
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:27,571
Damn it. If Myeong-bo isn't with you,
then where did he go?

572
00:48:27,654 --> 00:48:29,114
Where is he?

573
00:48:29,197 --> 00:48:31,700
Myeong-bo loves his home.

574
00:48:31,783 --> 00:48:34,745
But he packed up and left,
so he obviously went to see you,

575
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:35,829
you crazy little…

576
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:41,209
I'm not the only one
who thinks you're an obsessive flirt.

577
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,670
Eun-hui said so too.

578
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,840
She said it's not common
to get a divorce three times.

579
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:49,009
She thinks you brought it upon yourself.

580
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:52,220
That's just who you are.
You're addicted to men…

581
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:59,019
You know I'd never
say something like this.

582
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:01,605
Don't you trust me?

583
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:04,274
-In-jeong just made--
-Right.

584
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,360
I know.

585
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,988
I'm sure In-jeong just made things up.

586
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,407
You would never.

587
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:15,619
I trust you.

588
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:19,706
Why did you have to hug Myeong-bo
and touch him like that?

589
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,124
It only caused a mess.

590
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,461
Why can't I touch him?

591
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:28,048
-He's my friend.
-He's married.

592
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:34,763
You have no common sense.
That's why everyone criticizes you.

593
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:39,851
He's been getting abused by his wife.

594
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,437
I felt bad for him.

595
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:45,982
What's so wrong with
comforting him with a hug?

596
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:49,861
What do you mean he's been getting abused?

597
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,613
They get along well.

598
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:55,492
Myeong-bo isn't getting abused.
In-jeong isn't like that.

599
00:49:56,910 --> 00:49:58,203
I saw it.

600
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,624
I saw all the scars
and wounds on his body.

601
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,169
You're being absurd…

602
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:12,050
Then do you think I'm lying?

603
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:16,930
I trust you.

604
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:20,350
But I guess you don't trust me.

605
00:50:23,186 --> 00:50:24,771
Why would you say that?

606
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,942
If you trust me,

607
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:33,655
all you need to do is ask me
why I think that way.

608
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:39,536
Then I'd tell you that Myeong-bo showed me

609
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:44,082
his back and broken toenails
right outside the bar.

610
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:47,502
You wouldn't have
argued with me like this.

611
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,006
Okay, fine. I believe you.

612
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:56,178
Just go to bed and leave tomorrow.

613
00:50:57,929 --> 00:50:59,264
I'm tired.

614
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:03,101
"Two-faced."

615
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,024
"Horrible brat."

616
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:11,610
"Selfish brat."

617
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,576
What are you saying?

618
00:51:21,536 --> 00:51:22,662
Are you drunk?

619
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,963
That's what you think of me.

620
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:03,161
Are you crazy?
Why would you read my diary?

621
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,216
In a movie called Bridget Jones's Diary,

622
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,927
there's a scene
exactly like this situation.

623
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,808
The girl writes a bunch of bad things
about the guy,

624
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,184
and he reads it.

625
00:52:28,353 --> 00:52:30,230
When she finds out, she says this.

626
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,776
"I wrote all that stuff in my diary

627
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,612
a few months back."

628
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:42,576
"It was before I got to know you."

629
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,537
"But now,

630
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:48,331
I love you."

631
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:52,919
When the man hears that,
he makes up with her.

632
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:54,671
Why?

633
00:52:56,131 --> 00:52:59,551
Because it's okay for someone to hate you

634
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:01,803
when they don't know you very well.

635
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:07,309
If someone who didn't know me very well

636
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:11,313
went around calling me names
behind my back,

637
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,981
I'd just laugh it off.

638
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,192
If In-jeong did that,
I'd take it as a joke.

639
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,904
But…

640
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:28,288
you know me
better than anyone else in this world.

641
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:34,461
That's why it's hard for me
to laugh it off, Eun-hui.

642
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:41,134
Because if you call me a horrible,
selfish, two-faced brat,

643
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,556
it truly means I am one.

644
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:50,602
Tell me.

645
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:57,108
What makes me so horrible,
selfish, and two-faced?

646
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:02,113
What's wrong?

647
00:54:03,281 --> 00:54:04,991
Is the list too long?

648
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,117
Yes!

649
00:54:24,844 --> 00:54:25,971
Just go.

650
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:29,975
It's all in the past.

651
00:54:31,393 --> 00:54:32,686
Let's not dig it out.

652
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,273
What's the point of talking about it now?

653
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:40,068
It'll make us seem pathetic and petty.

654
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:47,117
I'll visit you in Seoul when I have time.
Let's talk about it then.

655
00:54:48,785 --> 00:54:50,245
If I'm two-faced,

656
00:54:53,331 --> 00:54:55,000
then you're something even worse.

657
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:03,258
You pretended to like me
when you didn't for years.

658
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,930
But then again, I understand.

659
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:13,852
You're someone who thinks
loyalty is the most important thing ever.

660
00:55:15,562 --> 00:55:17,230
So you want everyone

661
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:20,275
to always think that
you're a loyal, great friend.

662
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:23,737
But…

663
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,199
let me tell you something
as someone who knows you best

664
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,577
and has known you forever.

665
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:32,829
You see,

666
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:37,584
you're not that much of a loyal friend.

667
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,098
Hello?

668
00:55:53,058 --> 00:55:54,476
Yes, I'll be right out.

669
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:06,738
Just…

670
00:56:09,783 --> 00:56:11,034
abandon me.

671
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,290
You can't?

672
00:56:20,335 --> 00:56:22,587
Because loyalty is all you have?

673
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,757
Then I'll abandon you.

674
00:56:30,428 --> 00:56:32,388
I divorced my child's father.

675
00:56:33,681 --> 00:56:37,435
Then I abandoned two more guys
after I got married to them.

676
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,687
How hard would it be with you?

677
00:56:43,608 --> 00:56:44,776
What we had

678
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:47,862
was just a long, meaningless,

679
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:52,242
and empty friendship.

680
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:00,959
Let's just throw it in the trash
just like that diary of yours.

681
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,657
I love you, while living…

682
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,866
I'll stop singing.

683
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,204
What? I have no loyalty?

684
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,414
Are you here to argue?

685
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:07,502
But what do you mean,
Yeong-hui's coming to Jeju Island?

686
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,673
I'm going out with you
hoping to marry you one day.

687
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:15,093
Let's just go back
to being captain and haenyeo.

688
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:17,720
-Stop being stubborn.
-Why break up when we're in love?

689
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:21,349
I only went out with you
because I wanted to have fun.

690
00:59:25,019 --> 00:59:26,521
You look pretty shocked.

691
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,023
She's Yeong-hui, my twin sister.

692
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:34,946
