00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:01,144
More than the depression itself,

5
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:04,397
it troubled me that she showed
no desire to overcome it.

6
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,816
During our seven years of marriage,
she had neglected our son

7
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,276
due to her illness.

8
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,862
Like all patients
who suffer from depression,

9
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:13,531
I want to get better.

10
00:01:13,615 --> 00:01:16,284
Everybody, gather around

11
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,578
Mom.

12
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,997
Mom?

13
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:23,833
Mom.

14
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:48,024
Is there an object Yeol is attached to?

15
00:01:49,108 --> 00:01:53,154
I think he likes the yellow pony cup
that I bought him more.

16
00:01:54,823 --> 00:01:56,991
This is the last question.

17
00:01:57,075 --> 00:02:01,246
Why must you be the one to raise him?

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,456
That's becauseâ€¦

19
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,212
I can't live without him.

20
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:14,092
I need him to live.

21
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:18,388
-What is your dad to you?
-A friend.

22
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,724
She's sick.

23
00:02:21,808 --> 00:02:24,018
That's why she can't play with me.

24
00:02:24,686 --> 00:02:29,232
She's sick.

25
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:32,735
-What's going on?
-Over there.

26
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,280
-Look over there.
-Someone fell in the water.

27
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,532
-What happened?
-What's going on?

28
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,784
-Gosh.
-Someone must have jumped in.

29
00:02:39,868 --> 00:02:42,328
-Did something happen?
-Goodness, gracious.

30
00:02:42,412 --> 00:02:43,997
-My goodness.
-Oh, gosh.

31
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,582
-Someone fell in.
-How?

32
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,917
-Goodness.
-It happened over there.

33
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,420
-Where?
-Look over there.

34
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,213
-How did that happen?
-Goodness.

35
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,756
-Oh, gosh.
-My goodness.

36
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,426
-What's going on?
-I can't believe this.

37
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:58,344
This is bad.

38
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,138
Why haven't they rescued her yet?

39
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:03,266
-Do you think she's all right?
-Something must've happened.

40
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,643
-Exactly.
-Over there.

41
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:08,521
-They're trying to find her.
-Goodness.

42
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,325
You've reached 911.

43
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:24,120
Someone jumped into the Pureung Sea.

44
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,164
Over the breakwater.

45
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,585
A woman in her thirties.

46
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:21,928
JEONJIN 1

47
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:30,853
Should I also jump in?

48
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,189
If we all go in,
who's going to help them get out?

49
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,482
Let's just wait.

50
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:03,219
I found her!

51
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,637
-I found her!
-She found her!

52
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,015
-I found her!
-We found her!

53
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,808
-We found her!
-We found her!

54
00:05:08,891 --> 00:05:10,601
-We found her!
-We found her!

55
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,438
-We found her!
-Come out now!

56
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:16,607
-Hey, bring out a blanket.
-We found her!

57
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:17,775
We found her!

58
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:20,403
Ma'am, we found her!

59
00:05:30,038 --> 00:05:32,206
AMBULANCE

DANGER
RISK OF FALLING

61
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:04,072
-Dear me.
-How did she fall into the water?

62
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:06,282
-My gosh.
-Look at her.

63
00:06:06,365 --> 00:06:07,909
-Oh, dear.
-How did this happen?

64
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,827
Goodness, gracious.

65
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:12,497
-She could've died.
-My goodness.

66
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:24,467
IN-GWON AND HO-SIK 1

67
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,305
What's with you two?

68
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:32,934
-Take it down a notch.
-I'm so jealous.

69
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:34,894
What? They're really dating?

70
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,398
I bet my dad's going to cry his eyes out.

71
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,860
He won't be able to hit me,
so he'll probably hit himself.

72
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:44,278
What about your dad?

73
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,405
First, he'll beat me.
Then he'll cuss at me.

74
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:51,786
You actually deserve a little beating.
I'd do the same if I were your dad.

75
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,751
Hey!

76
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,924
I came up with a plan for us.

77
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,760
Here's Plan A.

78
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:11,889
First, we're going to tell our dads
about our current situation this week.

79
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:15,268
Next, we'll ask them to get us a place
and help us raise the baby

80
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:17,228
so I can continue to go to school.

81
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:20,231
The baby will be born
during our winter break,

82
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,442
so it won't affect
my attendance or grades.

83
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:24,694
-As for you--
-I'm going to drop out of school.

84
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,356
Why do you keep insisting on dropping out?

85
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,900
Just stay in school with me--

86
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:06,068
We already have to ask them
to get us a place.

87
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,363
I don't want to ask them to pay
for the formulas and diapers as well.

88
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,032
My pride won't let me.

89
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:14,744
I never wanted to go to med school anyway.

90
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,205
I'm serious.

91
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:20,541
What if you change your mind
and suddenly want to go to school?

92
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,918
I can always study again

93
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,046
after you graduate from med school.
Even then, I'd still only be 25.

94
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:26,964
That's still really young.

95
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,313
You're a stand-up guy. I'm proud of you.

96
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,985
Okay. Let's do that
since you're still young.

97
00:08:50,071 --> 00:08:54,200
I also came up with Plan B
just in case our dads disapprove.

98
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:57,578
We decided to have the baby
no matter what they say,

99
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,915
so I'll move into a facility
for single mothers in Jeju City.

100
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,795
But the problem is, if I go there,
we won't be able to live together--

101
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,130
And you'll have to transfer
to a different school.

102
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,675
Then you won't get regional benefits
or get into Seoul National University.

103
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,761
Let's not think that far.
It's giving me a headache.

104
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:19,934
Plus, I know my dad.

105
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,563
He'll throw a fit at first,

106
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:27,066
but he'll give in
just like he always does.

107
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,527
After all, he's always on my side.

108
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:34,073
If worse comes to worst,
our dads might tell you to get an abortion

109
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:36,826
-and make us break up--
-Then we'll flee to Seoul.

110
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,078
I'll go to a university
that's lower in rank.

111
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,163
What matters is that
I get into med school.

112
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:45,459
According to my research,
some schools even pay for your tuition,

113
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,921
dormitory, and living expenses
if you maintain good grades.

114
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,008
I also did some research.
In Seoul, you can get a room at a gosiwon

115
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,719
for just 300 to 400,000 won
without a deposit.

116
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,680
If I get paid 8,720 won an hour

117
00:09:57,763 --> 00:10:01,017
and work 10 hours a day
for 300 days a year,

118
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,560
I'll earn 26,160,000 won a year.

119
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,229
Amazing, right?

120
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,236
I can do anything
as long as I have you and the baby.

121
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,155
Yes, you're right. We can do it.

122
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,532
We'll also get child endowment
from the government.

123
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:21,078
Let's stay positive
no matter what happens.

124
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,123
What are you guys so happy about?

125
00:10:26,584 --> 00:10:28,294
We're happy to be in love.

126
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:33,966
Everyone's talking about your belly.
They think something's up.

127
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:39,263
They keep asking why your belly keeps

128
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:41,515
getting bigger.

129
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:45,019
For your information,
I didn't say anything.

130
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,898
I told you that it shows.

131
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:50,733
What are you going to do?

132
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,117
You should go to class.

133
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,161
What about you?

134
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:04,330
If Seon-mi knows,

135
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,374
our friends and teachers
will soon find out.

136
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,251
We should tell our dads
as fast as possible.

137
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:13,547
If the teacher asks where I am,
just make up an excuse for me.

138
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,386
Hyeon.

139
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:25,142
No matter how angry your dad gets,

140
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:28,771
don't ever apologize
or say that it was a mistake.

141
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:32,817
I won't.

142
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,655
If I do, it will turn our love into a sin,

143
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:40,282
and our baby will become a mistake.

144
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,785
I won't ever say those words.

145
00:11:43,702 --> 00:11:45,204
Even if I get beaten to death.

146
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,040
-Same goes for you.
-I won't.

147
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,043
Let's survive this.

148
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,212
Okay.

149
00:12:07,351 --> 00:12:09,562
EUN-HUI

150
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,442
What do you want?

151
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:15,943
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

152
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,361
Why did you call?

153
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:19,905
Wellâ€¦

154
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:25,536
Yeong-ju, as you already know,

155
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:29,748
I'm uneducated, nosy,

156
00:12:29,832 --> 00:12:31,709
and can be a bit too much at times.

157
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:35,379
Soâ€¦

158
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:38,883
I'm going to be straightforward with you.

159
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:43,220
By any chance, are you pregnant?

160
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:55,399
Why are you so quiet?

161
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,653
Is it really what I think it is?

162
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,366
Yes.

163
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:07,203
I'm pregnant.

164
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:09,497
It's Hyeon's.

165
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:16,253
I'm going to tell my dad today,
so please don't say anything.

166
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:28,974
Make way for the ice! Ice is here!

167
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:31,435
Come here.

168
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,356
Hey, doesn't the ice look beautiful today?
Look how sleek it is.

169
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:36,941
Whatever. Ice is just ice.

170
00:13:37,024 --> 00:13:41,237
You punk. It's hard to find
high-quality ice like this.

171
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,614
You don't know anything about ice.

172
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:48,744
Hey, can I have some food?
I skipped breakfast because of work.

173
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:50,871
Goodness.

174
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,970
Gosh.

175
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,440
What?

176
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,401
Is there something on my face?

177
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:22,820
Why are you staring at me?
It's making me blush.

178
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,204
What? What is it?

179
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,623
Why do you hate In-gwon?

180
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:37,543
-You just made me lose my appetite.
-Okay, fine.

181
00:14:37,626 --> 00:14:39,879
I won't talk about him. Sit back down.

182
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,316
You eat so well.

183
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:05,988
I should have married you.

184
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:09,909
Then all your good luck
would have been mine as well.

185
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:18,375
Eun-hui.

186
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,587
Once Yeong-ju leaves
for Seoul National University,

187
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,633
what do you say we give it another shot?

188
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:28,344
Are you kidding me?
In your current situation?

189
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,472
Hey, you brat.
What's wrong with my situation?

190
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,974
I did a great job of raising my daughter.

191
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,979
I'm not the Ho-sik you used to know.
I have some money now.

192
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,732
What do you say?

193
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,069
Let's give it a shot.

194
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,988
Once Yeong-ju leaves
for Seoul National University,

195
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,117
we can get a boat and go fishing together
as a lovely couple.

196
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:54,954
Lovely couple, my foot.
Just eat your damn food.

197
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,793
What are you looking at? Just eat!

198
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:02,920
Darn it.

199
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,255
Come on. That was gross.

200
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:13,305
SUNGHA HOSPITAL

201
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:16,183
The lady who jumped into the Pureung Seaâ€¦

202
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,811
-He's her guardian.
-I see.

203
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,313
What's your relationship?

204
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:23,482
I don't know her.

205
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:26,402
She's a stranger.

206
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,363
No one seemed to be around.

207
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,449
They asked me to pay for the ER.

208
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,535
Otherwise, they weren't
going to treat her.

209
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:35,911
So I paid out of sympathy.

210
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,538
Why did she jump in?

211
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,873
I don't know. Just ask her yourselves.

212
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,545
-Where's the patient?
-She's over there.

213
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,767
Did you ask her why she jumped?

214
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,144
She slipped.

215
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,603
It wasn't a suicide attempt.

216
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,439
So you're done investigating?

217
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,108
She just slipped, so it's a closed case.

218
00:17:08,318 --> 00:17:09,778
When is she getting discharged?

219
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,531
She's conscious,

220
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:15,367
but the nurse changed her IV.
I guess she's not well.

221
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:18,078
She'll probably stay a few more hours.

222
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,420
Why are you here? You should be working.

223
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:29,423
I did work.
I came after I delivered the fish.

224
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:33,552
The haenyeos were dying to know

225
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,764
whether the lady they saved
was still alive or not.

226
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,185
Dong-seok, do you know her?

227
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:45,647
When I saw you guys at Yeong-ok's bar,

228
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,357
it looked like you knew each other.

229
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,693
-Kind of.
-Who is she?

230
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,665
The owner of the bed and breakfast
wanted her to take this.

231
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,169
She didn't want a suicidal guest
staying at her place.

232
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:08,712
She was really angry.

233
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,381
She threw her bag out on the street. Gosh.

234
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,676
-Make sure she gets it.
-All right.

235
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,136
See you, Dong-seok.

236
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:08,564
There's going to be a typhoon tomorrow.
Clear everything up.

237
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,233
-All right. Goodbye.
-Hurry up.

238
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,734
Did you just get here?

239
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:17,072
I heard there's a typhoon coming.
Make sure everything's covered up.

240
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,491
I'm on my way home to tell my dad.

241
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,952
Eun-hui knows I'm pregnant.

242
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:23,745
We can't waste any more time.

243
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:27,332
Did you tell your dad?

244
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,294
I'm about to.

245
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:32,671
I'll call you later.

246
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:36,758
Damn it. We still have a potful of soup.

247
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:39,219
-Not many people came because it was hot.
-I know.

248
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,640
Why is everyone in the market
closing up so early?

249
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,810
Other markets are still busy
doing business at this time of day.

250
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:50,564
We're expecting a typhoon tomorrow.
You should clean up and go home.

251
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,567
What a bunch of bullshit.
Stop fussing over a damn typhoon.

252
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:56,737
I'm never coming back to this market.
It's not good for my business.

253
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:03,702
Ladies, you can leave now.
I'll clean up the rest.

254
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:06,705
-Okay, we're almost done.
-We just need to finish this up.

255
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:09,333
Look at you.

256
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,668
You really do look nothing like your dad.

257
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:14,963
Look at how handsome he is. My goodness.

258
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:18,800
How kind of you to help your father.
You're not only kind but also smart.

259
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,344
I heard you're going
to Seoul National University.

260
00:20:20,427 --> 00:20:22,554
Your father's always boasting about you.

261
00:20:22,638 --> 00:20:25,140
Damn it! Ladies, you chat too much!

262
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,435
-Just get going already!
-Okay.

263
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:30,646
-We're going.
-We're off.

264
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:33,815
-Goodness, let's go.
-We're off now. Bye.

265
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,360
-Thank you, ladies.
-Goodbye.

266
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:37,486
See you.

267
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:43,116
-Is school over already?
-Yes.

268
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,786
When did I ask you for help?

269
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:47,871
What brings you here?

270
00:20:48,705 --> 00:20:49,831
Do you need money?

271
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:55,420
No.

272
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:16,692
Then why are you here?

273
00:21:29,079 --> 00:21:30,163
What theâ€¦

274
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:47,556
What?

275
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:49,766
Yeong-juâ€¦

276
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,518
Yeong-ju?

277
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,770
What about her?

278
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,150
Yeong-ju isâ€¦

279
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,364
pregnant.

280
00:22:20,964 --> 00:22:22,174
Damn.

281
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:29,890
Whatâ€¦

282
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:32,642
Are you serious?

283
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:34,936
Yes.

284
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:37,898
Unbelievable.

285
00:22:39,775 --> 00:22:43,612
Gosh, I'm at a loss for words.

286
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:46,031
Goodness.

287
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:48,200
That brat really is unbelievable.

288
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:51,828
What's the point of being a top student?

289
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:55,999
I can't believe she slept around
after all that her father's done for her.

290
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,337
You're all set to be the top student.

291
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:04,466
Too bad for her,
but it's good news for you.

292
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,009
Okay, what else?

293
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,596
So Yeong-ju got pregnant.
What else is there to tell me?

294
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,433
I'mâ€¦

295
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,768
You're what?

296
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:17,562
Yeong-ju'sâ€¦

297
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,439
Yeong-ju?

298
00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:21,566
I'm the baby's father.

299
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:29,699
What?

300
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,536
Please help me.

301
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,706
Help us have the baby.

302
00:23:41,044 --> 00:23:42,254
Damn it.

303
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,469
Damn it.

304
00:23:56,017 --> 00:23:57,811
Damn it.

305
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:21,793
Come here.

306
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,379
Come stand in front of me.

307
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:27,132
Get over here. Damn it.

308
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,304
I can't believe this.

309
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,062
What are you saying?

310
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,150
So Yeong-ju's pregnant,

311
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,029
and the father is whom?

312
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:50,614
Me.

313
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:57,495
Put down the soda bottle.

314
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,338
I'm sorry, Dad.

315
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,675
But I love Yeong-ju a lot.

316
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,221
Please help.

317
00:25:15,847 --> 00:25:16,890
"Love"?

318
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:21,102
You fucking bastard.

319
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,020
"Love"?

320
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,565
I sent you to school to study,

321
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:29,319
but you go ahead and get a girl pregnant?
You damn bastard!

322
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,448
Come with me. I'll give you
the rest of your beating at home.

323
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,367
I'm going to kill you.

324
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,119
Follow me. Damn it.

325
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,705
Put down the damn pot!

326
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:43,500
Come here. You're dead.

327
00:25:57,389 --> 00:25:59,432
See? I knew it.

328
00:25:59,516 --> 00:26:02,435
This is so messed up. That two-faced brat.

329
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:05,188
She put on an act
so she could get the inheritance.

330
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:07,607
How can she be so deceitful?

331
00:26:08,191 --> 00:26:09,943
Dad, can we talk?

332
00:26:10,026 --> 00:26:12,696
That cunning brat.
She's going to burn in hell.

333
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,824
She's sly as a fox.

334
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:23,623
Hey, why did you turn it off?
It was an important scene.

335
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:28,545
I'm pregnant.

336
00:26:33,216 --> 00:26:34,718
What are you talking about?

337
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,888
You mean the main character?
She's not pregnant.

338
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,351
She lied to her father-in-law
just so she could get his money.

339
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,646
She's one scary brat.
She gives me the creeps.

340
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,357
No, not the main character.

341
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:51,818
Me.

342
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,113
I'm pregnant.

343
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,454
Your daughter, Bang Yeong-juâ€¦

344
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,459
is pregnant.

345
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,135
The baby's father is Hyeon, In-gwon's son.

346
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,842
Hyeon and I decided to have the baby.

347
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:12,649
What's wrong with this thing?

348
00:28:14,025 --> 00:28:16,820
Why does this damn fan keep tilting?

349
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,406
This damn piece of junk.
I should just throw it away!

350
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:43,430
Go and get dressed.

351
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:49,227
You and I are going to the hospital.

352
00:28:54,065 --> 00:28:55,900
You might not be pregnant.

353
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:57,026
Right?

354
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,573
You guys are just kids.

355
00:29:01,656 --> 00:29:04,033
What do you guys even know
about having sex?

356
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,369
I don't believe you.

357
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:08,413
Come on.

358
00:29:08,496 --> 00:29:12,584
Do you think
it's that easy to get pregnant?

359
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,336
We're going to the hospital.

360
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,297
-So get dressed.
-I am pregnant.

361
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:20,633
I already went to the OB-GYN.

362
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:24,179
We'll go to a proper one!

363
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,891
One with a competent doctor,
not just some quack.

364
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:29,142
Now, get up!

365
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:45,909
I don't need to see that.

366
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:51,873
Let's go to the hospital.
I'll talk to the doctor myself andâ€¦

367
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:31,162
I lied about being on a diet.

368
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:46,010
It's been more than six months,
so I can't get an abortion.

369
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,013
I'm going to have the baby,

370
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:51,099
so please help.

371
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,697
Did Hyeon, that damn punk,

372
00:31:08,408 --> 00:31:10,368
take advantageâ€¦

373
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:14,205
of you?

374
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:19,168
Did Yeong-ju seduce you?

375
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,630
Did she hit on you?

376
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:23,882
Did she?

377
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,677
I liked her first,
and I was the one who asked her out.

378
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,138
Good for you. Damn it.

379
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:33,224
Good going, you damn idiot!

380
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,436
Damn it. Hey, wait.

381
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:40,523
Didn't I get you condoms
for your birthday?

382
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:42,442
I told you to carry some around.

383
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:45,028
Didn't you use them? Are you dumb?

384
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:47,280
I did.

385
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,492
But I guess something went wrong
seeing that this happened.

386
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:52,869
How in the worldâ€¦

387
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,622
You damn idiot!

388
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,082
Get out.

389
00:31:58,791 --> 00:32:00,084
You're dead.

390
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,712
ABANG SUNDAE

391
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,965
Get out. Get out now.

392
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,843
-You're dead. Come with me.
-Why can't you just say that

393
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:11,095
Hyeon is a damn bastard?

394
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:26,527
He must have slept with you
against your will!

395
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:31,282
You're the class president!
A model student!

396
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,784
And the school president!

397
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:37,455
You'd never sleep aroundâ€¦

398
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:41,125
There's no way.

399
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:43,169
I never slept around.

400
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,215
Hyeon and I both love each other.

401
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,176
-That's why this happened.
-Stop it!

402
00:33:01,437 --> 00:33:02,855
I can't just sit back

403
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:05,650
and let you ruin your life

404
00:33:06,526 --> 00:33:08,486
just because of a one-time curiosity.

405
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:11,906
-Let's go to the hospital--
-It wasn't once. We did it twice.

406
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,283
It wasn't a mistake or against my will.

407
00:33:15,076 --> 00:33:15,994
It's love.

408
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:25,336
Damn it.

409
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:24,604
I'm not going to beat around the bush.

410
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:27,690
Tell Yeong-ju to get rid of the baby.

411
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,609
And stop seeing each other.

412
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,249
This is my baby inside Yeong-ju's belly.

413
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,794
Have a look.

414
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,634
Why do you want me
to look at that damn thing?

415
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:56,636
Why?

416
00:34:58,471 --> 00:35:02,141
You pathetic idiot.

417
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:04,936
Unbelievable.

418
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,661
-Damn it.
-Damn this, damn that.

419
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,539
Do you always have to cuss like that?

420
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,751
You littleâ€¦

421
00:35:31,504 --> 00:35:34,715
You're my damn son.

422
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:38,386
You still belong to me!
You're my son, you bastard!

423
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,972
I've been enduring
the smell of pig's blood

424
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:43,683
every single day
so I could raise you right.

425
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,852
You can't even eat sundae
because you have a weak stomach.

426
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,937
You don't have
what it takes to raise a baby!

427
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,523
And for what?

428
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,484
With what money?

429
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:55,486
With your damn allowance?

430
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,864
Gosh, you're just a baby!

431
00:35:57,947 --> 00:35:59,907
Just help us get a place of our own.

432
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,118
I'll quit school and take care of the--

433
00:36:10,835 --> 00:36:13,337
-Get rid of the baby.
-No.

434
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,798
I'm going to have the baby

435
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:18,634
and go to Seoul National University.

436
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:21,804
You know how persistent I am.

437
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,933
It's just going to be
a little hard on my body.

438
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,061
Let me live with Hyeon.

439
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:35,443
-Help us raise the baby.
-No!

440
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,237
No!

441
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,657
-No!
-Dad. Don't blame yourself.

442
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:50,917
I'mâ€¦

443
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:54,712
begging you.

444
00:36:55,546 --> 00:36:56,839
Iâ€¦

445
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:01,594
don't want to see you in pain.

446
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,430
I don't want you to give birth.

447
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,186
It's my body.

448
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,189
I'll be the one enduring the pain.

449
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,067
I'm going to have the baby.

450
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:26,244
Why would you do that? Why?

451
00:37:27,161 --> 00:37:28,913
Just one more yearâ€¦

452
00:37:29,538 --> 00:37:32,166
We had just one more year left.

453
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,296
You were going to go
to Seoul National University,

454
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:41,217
and I was going to go fishing on a boat.

455
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:45,346
You and I would've been free!

456
00:37:46,722 --> 00:37:50,142
So why would you choose to do that? Why?

457
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,686
Nothing's going to change.

458
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:54,188
I'll get into Seoul National University
even after I have the baby.

459
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,399
And you can get a boat and go fishing.

460
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,735
-Nothing's going to change!
-Are you crazy?

461
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:03,864
Just because of some girl,
you're standing there glaring at me

462
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,076
and telling me
you're going to quit school?

463
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,663
Have you lost your mind?

464
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:13,416
Alsoâ€¦

465
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:16,794
why aren't you apologizing on your knees?

466
00:38:17,795 --> 00:38:18,963
Beg!

467
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,966
Beg and say that you're sorry, you punk!

468
00:38:22,049 --> 00:38:23,509
I'm not sorry!

469
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,679
It wasn't a mistake.

470
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:28,931
Both Yeong-ju and the baby.

471
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,644
I chose them.

472
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:42,111
That damnâ€¦

473
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:55,750
Damn it.

474
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,002
What's the point in living a diligent life

475
00:38:58,085 --> 00:39:00,755
when my son turned out to be
an ungrateful punk?

476
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,923
I quit being a thug for an upright life

477
00:39:03,007 --> 00:39:05,009
and chopped sundae like crazy,
and for what?

478
00:39:05,843 --> 00:39:07,178
It's all pointless!

479
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,764
It's all useless!

480
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:11,015
EMPTY ROOM AVAILABLE

481
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,808
-It's pointless!
-What's going on?

482
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,685
-What is he doing?
-What's the noise?

483
00:39:14,769 --> 00:39:17,271
-It's that house over there.
-What's wrong with him?

484
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:22,902
Damn it!

485
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:26,197
In-gwon, what's all this noise?

486
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:28,491
In-gwon.

487
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:30,826
It's nothing.

488
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,665
Damn it.

489
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,145
"I WISH TO RETURN"

490
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:43,023
How's your dad taking it?

491
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,862
My dad's devastated right now.

492
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,665
My dad

493
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,460
is furious.

494
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:08,382
It breaks my heart
to see my dad like that.

495
00:41:11,802 --> 00:41:13,137
Butâ€¦

496
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:18,893
I still didn't apologize
or tell him it was a mistake.

497
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,147
I was a mean brat
and just said what I wanted to say.

498
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:28,736
Otherwise, I would've wavered
and done what my dad told me to do.

499
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:35,451
I bet my dad feels betrayed. Immensely.

500
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:46,045
I heard this typhoon is going to pass by.

501
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,757
But then again, all of them do.

502
00:41:50,799 --> 00:41:54,512
Just like this typhoon,
everything will eventually pass by.

503
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:58,057
Get some sleep, Yeong-ju.

504
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,059
I love you.

505
00:42:01,477 --> 00:42:05,356
I think I'm also
madly in love with you now.

506
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:08,817
I THINK I'M ALSO
MADLY IN LOVE WITH YOU NOW

CONVENIENCE STORE, CHINESE RESTAURANT,
SASHIMI RESTAURANT, PARCEL DELIVERYâ€¦

510
00:43:30,274 --> 00:43:31,817
The bed and breakfast

511
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,446
doesn't want a suicidal guest
staying at their place.

512
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:37,698
Do you have a place to go?

513
00:43:40,117 --> 00:43:41,327
I'll have to find one.

514
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:55,007
If you don't, hop in.
I'll find a place for you.

515
00:43:59,386 --> 00:44:01,597
Get in. It's windy. You'll catch a cold.

516
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:08,937
I won't make any advances.

517
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,642
Here.

518
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,686
Come on out.

BADANG MOTEL

00:45:57,296 --> 00:46:01,175
BADANG MOTEL

521
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:37,669
I got you a room with security bars
so you won't be able to jump out.

522
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,089
It may be suffocating, but bear with it.

523
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:42,424
I really slipped.

524
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,301
I suddenly became dizzy.

525
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:47,846
The fact that you went up there
is already suspicious enough, you brat.

526
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,742
Why do you look like that?

527
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:17,000
What have you gone through
to end up looking like that?

528
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:21,255
Tell me.

529
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:37,437
I just lived my life.

530
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:40,399
I got married,

531
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,776
had a kid,

532
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,237
then got divorced.

533
00:47:48,198 --> 00:47:49,408
My kidâ€¦

534
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,370
ended up living with his dad.

535
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:58,333
And now, I'm here.

536

DONG-SEOK

537
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,231
I see you haven't changed your number.

538
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:06,234
I wanted to check
if your number was the same.

539
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:08,403
Don't think about dying.

540
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,697
Don't make me worried.

541
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:13,200
SEON-A

542
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,928
I thought you were going to quit school.

543
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:35,889
Why are you in your uniform?

544
00:49:35,972 --> 00:49:39,226
I'm going to tell my teacher
that I'm dropping out.

545
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:41,103
Do that if you have a death wish.

546
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:45,315
Wait and see what happens if you do.

547
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:05,794
Hyeon, you were right.

548
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,089
The typhoon just passed by.

549
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,175
Let's cheer up.

550
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,418
The market's opening today,
so I'm off to work.

551
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:49,421
Call me after school.

552
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:51,006
I'll take you to a hospital.

553
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,636
BANG HO-SIK

JUNG IN-GWON

555
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,557
Damn you.

556
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,726
-Hey, hold him still.
-You bastard!

557
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,313
In-gwon! Move aside!

558
00:51:48,396 --> 00:51:49,397
Move!

559
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,317
Come on! Run!

560
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,487
Lose the fire extinguisher, you punk!

561
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:23,265
Ho-sik is a gambler.

562
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:26,142
He's not part of our gang.

563
00:52:26,726 --> 00:52:28,478
He came to see me and got involved.

564
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:46,162
Fire!

565
00:52:46,246 --> 00:52:47,497
Fire!

566
00:52:47,581 --> 00:52:49,958
Hey, stop! Over here!

567
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:52,419
Come on! Hurry!

570
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,607
-Have a good day.
-You too.

571
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:16,610
Over there!

572
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:18,445
Hey!

573
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:22,574
In-gwon. Hey.

574
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:36,755
When Yeong-ju grows up,
let's become in-laws.

575
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:43,053
They just turned a year old.
It'll take years for them to grow up.

576
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:45,805
They'll grow up in no time, you punk.

577
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,434
Okay, In-gwon.

578
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,187
Let's become in-laws.

579
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:56,399
So please don't die. Damn it!

580
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,250
BANG FAMILY ICE
ABANG SUNDAE

581
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:45,949
Both the son and father have a way
of messing up my life.

582
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,200
Those bastards.

583
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,369
Both the daughter and father

584
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,954
are as impudent as ever.

585
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:53,832
TEACHERS' OFFICE

586
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,670
Hey, I heard you're going to have a baby
and still stay in school.

587
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,547
You're going to be a father now.

588
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:02,465
Right?

589
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,843
Take good care of yourself.

590
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:08,263
Good for you.

591
00:55:14,769 --> 00:55:17,647
I'm on your side. Stay strong.

592
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:25,363
-Go, Yeong-ju! Go, Hyeon!
-Go, Yeong-ju! Go, Hyeon!

593
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:28,742
-Go, Yeong-ju! Go, Hyeon!
-Go, Yeong-ju! Go, Hyeon!

594
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,160
That's enough!

595
00:55:31,202 --> 00:55:32,662
Why are you all gathered here?

596
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,373
What are you excited about? Keep it down!

597
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,376
-Go, Yeong-ju. Go, Hyeon.
-Go, Yeong-ju. Go, Hyeon.

598
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,587
-Get lost!
-Go, Yeong-ju! Go, Hyeon!

599
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,131
-Go, Yeong-ju!
-Go, Yeong-ju! Go, Hyeon!

600
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,512
I asked our classmates

601
00:55:50,221 --> 00:55:52,599
if they were for or against
the class president staying in school

602
00:55:52,682 --> 00:55:54,017
after giving birth.

603
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,021
Ninety percent were for it.

604
00:55:58,772 --> 00:56:02,484
And so am I.
Just letting you know, bestie.

605
00:56:11,242 --> 00:56:13,578
You're having a baby
while you're still in school?

606
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,455
You punks.

607
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,500
Those with good grades
sometimes cause big trouble.

608
00:56:19,501 --> 00:56:21,127
You should be ashamed.

609
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:25,256
What's so wrong with being in love?

610
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,426
Listen, you brat.

611
00:56:29,094 --> 00:56:32,305
What will the other kids learn
from you two?

612
00:56:32,388 --> 00:56:34,599
You're the school president
and vice-president.

613
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:36,059
Do you have no shame?

614
00:56:37,685 --> 00:56:39,354
Am I the only one who's embarrassed?

615
00:56:40,021 --> 00:56:42,190
I just wish my kid doesn't
end up like you.

616
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,367
Follow me.

617
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:00,667
AGREEMENT FORM
SHOULD BANG YEONG-JU STAY IN SCHOOL?

618
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,837
Do your fathers approve?

619
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,340
Not yet.

620
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:11,636
Even if they don't approve,
we're still going to have the baby.

621
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:14,180
I'm sorry, ma'am.

622
00:57:14,264 --> 00:57:16,724
My grades won't go down
even after I give birth.

623
00:57:16,808 --> 00:57:18,309
Please let me stay in school.

624
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,727
If I get regional benefits,

625
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,980
I swear I'll get into
Seoul National University.

626
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:25,900
I talked to the principal
and vice-principal.

627
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,904
They both think you two should transfer--

628
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,781
I'll drop out of school as of today.

629
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:36,578
But there's no reason for Yeong-ju
to quit or transfer schools.

630
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,915
"A student shall not be discriminated
against due to pregnancy or childbirth."

631
00:57:41,499 --> 00:57:43,418
It's in the Ordinance of Student Rights.

632
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:46,296
Please help us, ma'am.

633
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,840
I studied really hard. You know that.

634
00:57:57,098 --> 00:57:58,224
Firstâ€¦

635
00:57:59,434 --> 00:58:00,977
bring your fathers to school.

636
00:58:10,612 --> 00:58:12,071
Isn't it tiring for your body?

637
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,492
It is.

638
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,537
You'd better treat her well.

639
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,831
I will.

640
00:58:33,384 --> 00:58:34,886
DAD

641
00:58:42,894 --> 00:58:44,020
Hello?

642
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:49,400
-What time does school end?
-It ended already.

643
00:58:50,652 --> 00:58:53,196
Why didn't you call?
I said I'll take you to a hospital.

644
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:55,907
I'm not going.
I have a private lesson today.

645
00:58:55,990 --> 00:58:57,200
Also, my teacher wants to see you.

646
00:58:58,868 --> 00:59:00,370
Come take a look at our hairtail.

647
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:04,207
Why does your teacher want to see me?

648
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:07,085
I told her that I want to stay in school
after I give birth.

649
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:11,381
Tell me when you're free.
I'll set up a meeting with her.

650
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,133
Hey. Bang Yeong-ju.

651
00:59:14,842 --> 00:59:16,594
Have you lost your mind?

652
00:59:17,178 --> 00:59:18,179
Hey. Hello?

653
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:21,182
Damn it!

654
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:22,475
-Damn it!
-Hey!

655
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,812
Why are you cussing
in front of all the elders?

656
00:59:26,896 --> 00:59:28,648
That damn lunatic.

657
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,820
The number you are calling
is currently unavailable. Pleaseâ€¦

658
00:59:35,863 --> 00:59:36,698
Fuck!

659
00:59:36,781 --> 00:59:38,741
Ho-sik!

660
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,327
-Can I have some hairtail?
-Oh, sure. Hairtail?

661
00:59:48,126 --> 00:59:50,211
Whatâ€¦

662
00:59:51,296 --> 00:59:54,841
Gosh, this is bad.

663
00:59:54,924 --> 00:59:56,676
I guess he knows about Yeong-ju.

664
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,678
Did something happen to Yeong-ju?

665
00:59:58,761 --> 01:00:00,096
Just get back to work.

666
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,766
Take a break. You're overdoing it.

667
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:08,813
BYEOLIDALI COFFEE MENU

668
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,231
I'm fine.

669
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,989
I brought you sundae soup
with noodles. Eat up.

670
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:21,618
-You both skipped lunch.
-Is something wrong?

671
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:24,579
Ho-sik is as gentle as a lamb.
I've never heard him cuss before.

672
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:26,497
Did Ho-sik and Yeong-ju have a fight?

673
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:28,124
I don't know.

674
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,837
He thinks the world of his daughter.

675
01:00:32,920 --> 01:00:34,130
He would never.

676
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:37,467
People fight out of love.
If not, why would they fight?

677
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:44,265
Dong-seok isn't here today.

678
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:49,562
I think Dong-seok knows the woman
who fell into the water yesterday.

679
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:51,230
He apparently went after her.

680
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:53,691
Buy some vegetables.

681
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:55,610
Buy someâ€¦

682
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,410
Hello, Mr. Jung. Hyeon's been
skipping classes at the academy

683
01:01:04,494 --> 01:01:07,747
without giving us any prior notice,
and he won't answer his phone.

684
01:01:07,830 --> 01:01:10,166
Did something happen to him?

685
01:01:10,249 --> 01:01:12,293
He's been skipping classes at the academy?

686
01:01:14,921 --> 01:01:17,757
That kid must be out of his mind.

687
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:31,145
What are you going to do about Yeong-ju?

688
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,273
Don't tell me you plan
to let her have the baby.

689
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,697
Do you think I'm nuts?

690
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,408
I'm not letting her
carry on your bloodline.

691
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:58,506
-My bloodline?
-That's right.

692
01:01:59,257 --> 01:02:00,466
Your bloodline.

693
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,792
Take Yeong-ju to a good hospital
and get rid of the baby.

694
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,628
Don't waste time.

695
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,816
-Throw a do!
-Come on!

696
01:02:58,900 --> 01:03:01,736
-Gae!
-Do!

697
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,239
-It's a do!
-It's a do!

698
01:03:05,323 --> 01:03:06,282
-My turn.
-Go for it.

699
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,034
-One more time.
-Just once more.

700
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:09,368
-Give me a yut!
-Come on!

701
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:12,330
-Nice!
-Nice!

702
01:03:13,706 --> 01:03:15,416
Give us the money!

703
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:18,169
-Give me your money!
-Give it here!

704
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:19,420
Pass it over!

705
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:48,115
-Ho-sik, you should eat.
-Ho-sik, come talk with us.

706
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:15,434
I'm hungry.

707
01:04:17,144 --> 01:04:18,229
Right.

708
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:33,911
Ho-sik, can we talk?

709
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,122
-Hey.
-Ho-sik.

710
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:40,042
He's totally lost it.

711
01:05:02,148 --> 01:05:03,733
-Goodbye, sir!
-Goodbye, sir!

712
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,360
-Damn it. You're here again?
-In-gwon.

713
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,947
Help me out one last time.

714
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:12,450
Damn you. That's what you said last time.

715
01:05:12,533 --> 01:05:15,119
I told you to stop gambling.
I might as well kill you.

716
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,124
Yeong-ju's mother ran away.

717
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:29,091
Yeong-ju hasn't eaten anything.

718
01:05:33,804 --> 01:05:35,473
Yeong-ju.

719
01:05:36,599 --> 01:05:38,893
Goodness, look at you.

720
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,105
Say, "Can I have some money?"

721
01:05:43,189 --> 01:05:45,399
Can I have some money?

722
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:12,677
Does it feel nice
to use your daughter for money?

723
01:06:13,678 --> 01:06:15,471
You dirt-poor loser.

724
01:06:20,184 --> 01:06:21,686
Dad, I got money.

725
01:07:20,786 --> 01:07:21,829
Step outside.

726
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,707
You damn bastard.

727
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,418
What's going on between you two?

728
01:07:42,683 --> 01:07:44,018
There. I stepped outside.

729
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,606
What now, you bastard?

730
01:07:49,356 --> 01:07:51,108
-Oh, my gosh!
-You bastard!

731
01:07:51,192 --> 01:07:54,779
-Stop it!
-You asshole! Come here, you bastard!

732
01:07:55,488 --> 01:07:57,073
You scum!

733
01:07:57,656 --> 01:07:59,075
Damn you!

734
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:01,160
Come here!

735
01:08:36,612 --> 01:08:38,781
You were the only one I could rely on.

736
01:08:38,864 --> 01:08:40,699
-Stop right there!
-Have you forgotten?

737
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:42,284
Because I could never forget that.

738
01:08:42,368 --> 01:08:45,371
Could I love a liar?

739
01:08:45,454 --> 01:08:46,330
YEONG-OK

740
01:08:46,413 --> 01:08:48,541
What about you, Captain?
Don't you miss me?

741
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:49,708
Shouldn't you go to school?

742
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,544
-Oh, dear!
-Goodness.

743
01:08:53,420 --> 01:08:54,797
Do you need help?

744
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,841
You're a high school dropout.

745
01:08:56,924 --> 01:08:58,884
Why would she live with a guy like you?

746
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:00,928
Dad. Just say yes.

747
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:04,932
I'm going to save you and Hyeon
from ruining your lives.

748
01:09:05,015 --> 01:09:06,100
Let go of her.

749
01:09:06,183 --> 01:09:08,144
I said, let go!

750
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:17,236
