1
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,903
OK-DONG AND DONG-SEOK

2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,700
OK-DONG AND DONG-SEOK

3
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:11,988
Coffee.

4
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,868
Let's have breakfast first.

5
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,941
Come with me.

6
00:02:29,691 --> 00:02:30,608
The cafe is there.

7
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,903
The restaurant is right here.
Go on inside.

8
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:35,989
I'm going to go there and eat gimbap.

9
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's eat first.

10
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,213
What do you want?

11
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,883
Let's go. I'm going to eat gimbap.

12
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:39,969
You can't eat gimbap.
You have stomach cancer.

13
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,639
Just eat rice with soup.

14
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,682
I want gimbap.

15
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,769
Damn it! Why are you so stubborn?

16
00:03:48,394 --> 00:03:50,313
You never listen.

17
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:57,820
Fine. Eat what you want.
I'm going to have rice with soup!

18
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:24,639
OK-DONG AND DONG-SEOK 2

19
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:51,457
All set.

20
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,269
You look beautiful.

21
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:21,070
I don't want to go.

22
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,406
You can keep this.

23
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:26,826
And give this to your parents.

24
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,300
Fine. Let's not go.

25
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:46,637
Really?

26
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:48,056
Yes, really.

27
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,811
Neither of us has work today,

28
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:57,690
and we're both dressed up.
So how about a movie?

29
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,109
Or should we go downtown?

30
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:05,323
Let's watch a movie.

31
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:25,134
Call your parents.

32
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,804
They're probably waiting for us.
Tell them we can't go.

33
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,890
If we don't show up,
they'll get the message.

34
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:33,059
Call them. It's the right thing to do.

35
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,978
I can't. I feel too bad.

36
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:37,855
I'd rather just stay quiet.

37
00:06:39,023 --> 00:06:41,484
-What if they call?
-I'll ignore them for a bit.

38
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,446
-This was a bad idea.
-You were the one who agreed to it.

39
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:51,577
Hey, I was a bit drunk that day.

40
00:06:52,453 --> 00:06:54,205
I said that on impulse.

41
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:57,959
You kept asking me to meet your parents
and gazed at me with those puppy eyes.

42
00:06:58,042 --> 00:07:00,586
Fine. It's my fault. I'm the jerk.

43
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,588
Let's just drop it.

44
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,633
You're not a jerk.

45
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,554
You hate me, don't you?

46
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,641
Just a teeny bit right now.

47
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,566
Did you tell them
about my sister, Yeong-hui?

48
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,401
Yes.

49
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,405
-And that my parents have passed?
-Yes.

50
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,491
Yet they still welcomed me?

51
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,955
I guess they weren't very welcoming.

52
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:38,624
I guess they didn't have a choice.

53
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,008
But I'm sure they will like you
once they meet you.

54
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,352
Let's take my car, not yours.

55
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:03,816
If your parents make it obvious
that they don't like me,

56
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,569
then I'm sorry, but I won't hold it in.

57
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:08,905
I'm going to get in my car and leave.

58
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,991
I won't ever visit them again,
and as for us--

59
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,493
You'd better not say you'll end it.

60
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,583
Even if my parents disapprove
of our marriage…

61
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,002
No, not marriage.

62
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:25,087
Even if they disapprove of us
being together,

63
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,715
I'm still going to stay with you.
That won't change.

64
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:34,555
And if by any chance,
my parents do anything to offend you,

65
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,265
hold back just three times.

66
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:40,937
For my sake.

67
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,941
So I won't feel too sorry
about going against my parents.

68
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,817
You understand that, right?

69
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:51,030
Just know…

70
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,368
that I love you an incredible amount.

71
00:08:55,451 --> 00:08:57,662
Of course, I know.

72
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:01,874
I'll drive.

73
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,276
Navigation commencing.

74
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:30,903
All right. Let's get going.

75
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,880
If you're nervous…

76
00:10:02,643 --> 00:10:05,104
I'm pretty sure
your parents won't like me.

77
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:06,981
I doubt it.

78
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,444
Captain, I hate how
overly positive you are right now.

79
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:12,987
It's annoying.

80
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:18,242
I promise I'll try my best
to become a pessimistic person.

81
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,165
-That's my mom.
-What?

82
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,719
Mom. Dad. I'm here!

83
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,682
They're very nice people.
I really admire them.

84
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,851
Of course they're nice to you.

85
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,366
Why are you working out in the field?
I told you we'd be coming.

86
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:11,379
Neither of them smiled at me.

87
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:14,048
That's strike one.

88
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:15,174
All right.

89
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,468
Let's eat!

90
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:37,696
-Jeong-jun.
-What?

91
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,490
Dad isn't in a good mood.

92
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:42,618
It's even worse with Mom.

93
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,178
Let me.

94
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:04,265
Jeong-jun.

95
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:06,475
Yes, Mom?

96
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,936
Take this tray.

97
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:12,022
Put the chicken in here and bring it out.

98
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,065
Okay.

99
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:18,988
Your mom won't even talk to me.

100
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,157
She's pretty reserved.

101
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,533
She won't look at me either.

102
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:25,578
Anyway, that's strike two.

103
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:27,830
One more strike and it's over.

104
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:34,170
This looks delicious.

105
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,927
All right, everyone. Let's eat.

106
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,096
-Dad, let's eat.
-Okay.

107
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:50,936
Take a seat.

108
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:55,733
Mom. Dad. Why haven't you spoken a word
to her after inviting her over?

109
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,318
You're making her feel awkward.

110
00:13:00,738 --> 00:13:02,615
Let's go ahead and eat.

111
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,617
Eat up.

112
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:07,912
Talk to her, Mom.

113
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:13,000
I won't bring Byeol-i here
if this is how you're going to treat her.

114
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,633
Mom.

115
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:25,763
Eat up.

116
00:13:35,689 --> 00:13:38,984
I bet it wasn't easy to care for
your disabled sister all on your own

117
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,028
after your parents had passed.

118
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:47,785
It must have been tough for you.

119
00:13:58,712 --> 00:14:01,674
Don't cry at the dinner table.

120
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,179
-Try the chicken.
-Okay.

121
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:20,818
Jeong-jun.

122
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:23,070
You'd better be good to her.

123
00:14:25,614 --> 00:14:30,786
If he ever mistreats you, let me know.

124
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,122
Good.

125
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,292
Why? So you can beat your beloved son?

126
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:37,918
Hey, watch it.

127
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,337
Nice. She passed.

128
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,299
This is delicious.

129
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,677
Give me some kimchi.

130
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:50,389
Try this.

131
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,516
Sit comfortably.

132
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,184
You can sit comfortably.

133
00:14:54,977 --> 00:14:57,730
Go ahead. It's okay.

134
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:27,718
Delicious.

135
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,430
Gi-jun, sing us a song.

136
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,975
Put the kimchi right here.

137
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,061
Eat up.

138
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:51,116
Tell me everything that you want to do.

139
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,535
I'll do it all for you.

140
00:15:56,163 --> 00:15:59,333
We'll go to Mokpo and attend
the memorial service at Jong-u's place.

141
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:01,502
Then what? Tell me what you want to do.

142
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:10,344
Let's go to Madang-ri.

143
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,430
What?

144
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,351
Madang-ri. It's at the very end of Mokpo.

145
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,396
Where is that place?

146
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:23,774
Okay, fine. We'll go to Madang-ri.

147
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:28,070
And then? Then what?

148
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,031
What else?

149
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,997
Is that it?

150
00:16:47,631 --> 00:16:51,427
Let me know if you think of anything else
you'd like to do while you're still alive

151
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:54,847
as we visit Jong-u's place
and drop by Madang-ri.

152
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,267
I'll do everything for you.

153
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:01,687
I bet you're wondering
what's gotten into me.

154
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,898
I bet you're flabbergasted.

155
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,988
I bet you think I'm mending my ways
because you're about to die.

156
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:14,283
I bet you're…

157
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:17,119
Damn it. I should lose this damn dialect.

158
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:20,831
I bet you're dying to know why.

159
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,250
Well, I'll tell you.

160
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,004
Do everything you want.

161
00:17:29,298 --> 00:17:30,632
Then brace yourself.

162
00:17:33,552 --> 00:17:35,387
Wait and see what I have to say.

163
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:53,530
After the announcement is over,
passengers with vehicles

164
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,408
-are advised to go to their vehicles
-We're here.

165
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,370
and wait inside
until the ferry is fully docked.

166
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,875
Once the ferry is fully docked,

167
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:08,462
passengers without vehicles will be
the first to get off the ferry.

168
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:13,092
In order to prevent accidents
due to a crowd of passengers,

169
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:16,136
follow the instructions
given to you by the cabin attendants

170
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:20,766
so that all passengers can
safely get off the ferry…

171
00:18:24,978 --> 00:18:26,772
See? You know how to be nice.

172
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:49,378
Dong-seok's awfully nice to you
now that he knows you're sick.

173
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:53,215
All right. Fasten your seat belts.

174
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:10,858
Oh, come on.

175
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,412
TO TERMINAL

176
00:19:45,809 --> 00:19:48,979
MOKPO SO-HAE HOSPITAL

177
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,947
Should I wait here?

178
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,116
What about Chun-hui's stuff?

179
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,703
I'll just ask Hae-seon
to pick them up later on.

180
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,830
What's Man-su's address?

181
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,876
It's a place called Hana Villa
right behind the hospital.

182
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:13,420
Leave them with the security guard.

183
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:15,547
Tell him they belong to Man-su's family.

184
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,472
Will you see him?

185
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,557
Just mind your own…

186
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,769
We already talked on the phone.

187
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,813
We promised to meet up for drinks
once he's better.

188
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:34,107
-After I drop everything off--
-Come back here.

189
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:44,618
Dong-seok has a good heart,
seeing that he even called Man-su.

190
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,204
Unbelievable.

191
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,124
She's really using this chance
to do everything she wants.

192
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,942
Look. Grandma is here.

193
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:20,112
-Grandma!
-Oh, goodness.

194
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:24,366
Come here, my little puppy.
Have you been well?

195
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:26,285
Eun-gi, you remember me too, right?

196
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,921
You must be exhausted
from the long journey.

197
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,425
Come this way.

198
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:55,605
Goodness gracious. My sweet boy.

199
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,774
He can really move his toes.

200
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,073
I told you I could.

201
00:22:05,782 --> 00:22:07,451
I can even lift my head up.

202
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,536
Oh, dear. Careful not to hurt your neck.

203
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,249
My spine is fine too.

204
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,793
The doctor says it's a miracle.

205
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,881
It's not easy to recover this quickly
after regaining consciousness.

206
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,638
Ms. Kang.

207
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,641
Why are you sick?

208
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,561
Man-su, get better soon

209
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:38,774
so you can come walking to my funeral
and enjoy the rice cakes there.

210
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,903
Don't say that.

211
00:22:42,986 --> 00:22:44,946
He can get rice cakes somewhere else.

212
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,824
He doesn't need to go
to your funeral for that.

213
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,868
Why would you talk such nonsense?

214
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,370
I want black bean rice cakes
at my funeral.

215
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,247
Omegi rice cakes too.

216
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,417
Or just make all your favorite rice cakes.

217
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:58,919
Will you stop?

218
00:23:00,504 --> 00:23:02,714
Try moving your toes again.

219
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:58,395
-How do you feel?
-I'm fine.

220
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,692
You can't die here.
Wait until I return to Jeju.

221
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,528
You're going to your parents' graves
with Dong-seok tomorrow.

222
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,113
So try to hang in there.

223
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:17,205
Just keep it for yourself.

224
00:24:21,918 --> 00:24:24,671
Give it to Man-su and Eun-gi.

225
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,634
Give it to Dong-seok.
I'll give Man-su my own money.

226
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:34,014
If you're not going to give it
to Man-su or Eun-gi, keep it for yourself.

227
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:35,807
Take it.

228
00:24:36,474 --> 00:24:38,476
I'll follow you right after.

229
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:46,026
Not until you see Man-su walk next year.

230
00:24:46,526 --> 00:24:51,198
Not until you see Eun-gi start school
the year after that.

231
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,284
There's no need to rush.

232
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:39,704
Go back inside.

233
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:42,916
Bye.

234
00:25:58,014 --> 00:25:59,182
We're off.

235
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,068
Fasten your seat belt.

236
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,061
Where should we go now?

237
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,857
We need alcohol for the service.

238
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:52,152
All right. Your wish is my command.

239
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,156
MOOJI MART

240
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:57,282
Will this do?

241
00:26:57,866 --> 00:26:59,784
Something nice. Buy a bottle of cheongju.

242
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:25,352
Is this pronounced "su"?

243
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,313
You still don't know how to read?

244
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,359
Even after Dong-i and I taught you
again and again when we were little?

245
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:34,194
Are you dumb?

246
00:27:34,277 --> 00:27:37,822
And is this pronounced "bok"?

247
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:39,949
It's an idiom that means,

248
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,576
"Live a happy and long life."

249
00:27:41,659 --> 00:27:43,536
How could you still not know how to read?

250
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,791
What's Jong-u's address?

251
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,377
Sajeong.

252
00:27:51,461 --> 00:27:53,213
Useong Apartment.

253
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,507
Building 102.

254
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,301
Unit 703.

255
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:03,181
You can memorize that
but not the Korean alphabet?

256
00:28:05,934 --> 00:28:07,477
I just don't get it.

257
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,271
Navigation commencing.

258
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,619
Do Jong-u and Jong-cheol
come to visit you in Jeju?

259
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,455
Jong-cheol visits at times.

260
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:30,208
"At times"?

261
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:32,252
And only Jong-cheol?

262
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,422
You cared for their sick mother
for 15 years

263
00:28:35,505 --> 00:28:38,216
and sick father for more than ten years.

264
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,177
But one guy seldom comes,
and the other guy never does?

265
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,597
I could just visit them instead.

266
00:28:51,938 --> 00:28:54,107
Did they even ask you to come today?

267
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,900
I mean, did they?

268
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,653
Damn it.

269
00:29:00,113 --> 00:29:02,198
I can't believe you came
without an invitation,

270
00:29:02,782 --> 00:29:05,326
and I can't believe those jerks
didn't even invite you.

271
00:29:10,457 --> 00:29:13,877
I'm going to be as nice to you
as I possibly can.

272
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,672
But I don't know
when I'll burst and start lashing out.

273
00:29:18,214 --> 00:29:19,799
So brace yourself.

274
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:27,432
Which floor?

275
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:29,476
The seventh.

276
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,271
Going up.

277
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:56,169
He was your stepfather.
You even took his money.

278
00:29:56,252 --> 00:29:58,963
Pour him a drink and apologize.

279
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,256
That's enough.

280
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,593
I don't even hold
a memorial service for my own dad.

281
00:30:04,469 --> 00:30:06,012
Know when to stop.

282
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:10,517
-Excuse me.
-Goodness.

283
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:12,519
Who are you, ma'am?

284
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,562
Isn't this Kim Jong-u's place?

285
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:16,689
"Kim Jong-u"?

286
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,984
-Isn't that Kim Jong-u's place?
-No.

287
00:30:20,527 --> 00:30:24,113
You must be talking about Mr. Kim,
the guy who runs a kimchi factory.

288
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:28,618
He moved to Building 103, Unit 801.

289
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,286
It's been almost a year.

290
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,205
-A year?
-Yes.

291
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:51,808
When did you last call Jong-u?

292
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:56,646
Two months ago.
He came to visit his mother's grave.

293
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:58,857
I saw him then.

294
00:31:02,569 --> 00:31:04,988
Does even he know
that you're coming today?

295
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:07,448
He knows.

296
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:09,826
I told him that day.

297
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:13,246
But he didn't mention that he moved?

298
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:17,625
You shouldn't go to Jong-u's place.

299
00:31:22,547 --> 00:31:24,591
I won't go even if you beg me to.

300
00:31:32,348 --> 00:31:35,226
Come to my truck afterward.
You know where it's parked, right?

301
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:42,650
Oh, Mother.

302
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:45,570
Goodness, what's all this?

303
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,282
You should've called.
Then we would've gone to pick you up.

304
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:52,035
You never called,
so I didn't think you were coming.

305
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,121
Come inside.

306
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,916
Why couldn't she call first?

307
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:01,794
What a bunch of shameless jerks.

308
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,476
I'm attending your dad's memorial service.

309
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,192
What do you do for a living?

310
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,194
I run a general store.

311
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:11,739
I heard you failed a huge business

312
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,700
and run a kimchi factory now.

313
00:33:15,118 --> 00:33:17,495
What did you say to me?

314
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:21,040
Watch the way you speak.

315
00:33:22,208 --> 00:33:25,169
What? Do you expect me
to treat you like an older brother?

316
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,006
My wife and kids are at home.

317
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:31,384
Just pour my late dad a drink and leave.

318
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,970
I'll allow that for your mother's sake.

319
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,020
Jong-cheol couldn't come
because we received a group reservation.

320
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:43,938
We couldn't cancel because of the money.

321
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,983
-I'm sorry, Mother.
-You're here, so it's fine.

322
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,862
Why did you bring so much food?

323
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:51,988
Gosh.

324
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,408
Thanks to you,
there's not much left to prepare.

325
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:57,869
We're so lucky.

326
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,829
Where are the kids?

327
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,124
Our eldest is studying in Seoul.

328
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,754
Our youngest went to his friend's house
to study and sleep over there.

329
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:09,881
They're taking exams soon.

330
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:12,508
Should I tell him to come?

331
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,677
No, it's okay. Don't bother.

332
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:16,471
Next time.

333
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,348
You have no next time, Mom.

334
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,395
Jong-u, set the table
for the memorial service.

335
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:06,938
Dong-seok, you should join.

336
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,023
Let's clean up now.

337
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,652
It's been a long time
since Dong-seok last came here.

338
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,571
-Why don't you pour Father a drink?
-Just clean up.

339
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,573
Let's get ready to eat.

340
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,672
Mother, don't just drink the soup.

341
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:35,466
-Have the meat, too.
-She can't eat meat.

342
00:35:37,218 --> 00:35:39,470
She can't even eat rice.

343
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,473
-Do you have weak teeth?
-Are you unwell?

344
00:35:43,307 --> 00:35:45,560
I'm fine. Let's just eat.

345
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:53,234
My husband has told me
a lot about you, Dong-seok.

346
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,360
What did he say?

347
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:58,364
Did he tell you about how he and Jong-u
used to beat me up to a pulp

348
00:35:58,447 --> 00:35:59,907
and laugh about it all the time?

349
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:04,078
Other than that, he wouldn't have had
anything else to say about me.

350
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:09,750
He just told me that life was hard
for all of you guys back then.

351
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:14,630
Let's get going after we eat.

352
00:36:15,298 --> 00:36:18,467
Well, of course.
It's not like I'm going to live here.

353
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:23,598
I can't believe you lost
all of your dad's fortune

354
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,808
and ended up like this.

355
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:32,982
Let's go.

356
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,985
-Are you leaving?
-Yes, we should get going.

357
00:36:36,068 --> 00:36:39,238
I get why your dad died
due to pent-up anger.

358
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:43,492
He had dozens of boats,
but you sold and lost all of them.

359
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:47,538
Then you lost your old house and land,

360
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:50,750
made that old lady move back
to her run-down house,

361
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:53,085
and received billions of won as indemnity.

362
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:55,087
And this is how you turned out?

363
00:36:56,631 --> 00:36:58,299
Where are you going? I'm talking.

364
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:02,970
Don't you know
why he died of pent-up anger?

365
00:37:03,054 --> 00:37:06,015
It's because you stole
all our jewelry and cash…

366
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:08,976
I might as well just beat you…

367
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:11,479
-Damn it. That bastard.
-Let's just go. Come on.

368
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,773
What is the matter with you?

369
00:37:14,357 --> 00:37:16,817
-I might as well beat you to death.
-Go ahead.

370
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,653
Try and beat me, you damn thief.

371
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:21,405
What? A damn thief?

372
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,865
-Get off me!
-Just stop.

373
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,075
Let's just go!

374
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,451
A damn thief, you say?

375
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,911
-Dong-seok.
-A damn thief?

376
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,955
Try calling me that again. I dare you!

377
00:37:29,038 --> 00:37:30,706
-Please just leave.
-A damn thief?

378
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:33,793
You make it sound like
the jewelry and cash were worth tons,

379
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:36,504
but they only added up to 20 million won!

380
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:40,925
You and Jong-cheol, that bastard,
always beat me like a damn animal,

381
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,551
and that was just compensation!

382
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:46,430
My dad collapsed, fell unconscious,
and died because of you.

383
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:49,058
-You bastard. You damn thief.
-Stop it.

384
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,268
How dare you!

385
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:51,978
How dare you throw a fit here.

386
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:53,479
We pitied you and took you in,

387
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,231
-but you just stole from us.
-What?

388
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,525
-Let go of me!
-You pitied me and took me in?

389
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,568
That crazy little…

390
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:09,161
Your parents didn't die
because of Dong-seok.

391
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:11,163
Your father got drunk and hurt himself.

392
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,957
Then he died due to shock

393
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,876
after you sold his boats and land
due to your failed business.

394
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,713
-Don't blame it on him.
-Let's just go.

395
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,800
I took care of your sick mother
for a good 15 years,

396
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:26,721
then spent over ten years taking care
of your sick father like a slave.

397
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,639
Where's my compensation for that?

398
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,683
Give me that money first!

399
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:34,061
Then I'll return the money
he stole from your father.

400
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,647
Let's just go.
Don't bother talking to that jerk.

401
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:41,027
You and your brother weren't even there
to watch your parents pass away,

402
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,778
so you have no say!

403
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,114
He stole more, didn't he?

404
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:48,951
-I should rip that bastard apart.
-Let's just go.

405
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,745
-Just go.
-What an ungrateful son.

406
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,914
What did he do so wrong?

407
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,542
Let's just get out of here.
Don't bother talking to him.

408
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,127
-Let's just go!
-What…

409
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:00,671
What did he do so wrong?

410
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,759
He always got beaten up
by you and your brother for no reason,

411
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,928
and his mother was a mistress
who worked like a slave.

412
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:11,932
He did more than enough
by putting up with all of that.

413
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:14,894
What more do you expect from him?

414
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:20,691
We should be thankful that
that young boy didn't do anything extreme

415
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,904
to take it out on us
or do anything to harm himself!

416
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,033
You have no right to badmouth him!

417
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,453
-You have no right.
-That's enough. Let's go.

418
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,454
You have no right!

419
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,457
-Let's just go.
-You have no right.

420
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,918
You have no right

421
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:43,339
to call him a damn thief!

422
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,302
Be careful, Mother.

423
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:52,181
Aren't you coming?

424
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,451
YOU HAVE A VISITOR

425
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:13,744
Let him in.

426
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:20,334
I apologize.

427
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:22,670
Try to let this slide.

428
00:40:23,546 --> 00:40:27,425
This will be the last time
you see me or my mom.

429
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,680
And don't come to her funeral.

430
00:40:37,309 --> 00:40:41,021
Your aunt has terminal cancer.
She doesn't have much time left.

431
00:40:42,314 --> 00:40:45,526
So I guess she has nothing to lose.
She's not thinking straight.

432
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,364
Have a comfortable life then.

433
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,259
Should we go to a hospital?

434
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:35,386
Do you want an IV shot?

435
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,681
Or at least get some painkillers.

436
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,489
GONGWONSANG INN

437
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:07,436
Go and wash up.

438
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,230
Okay.

439
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,229
Do you want to sleep on the bed,
or should I lay the sheets on the floor?

440
00:45:04,618 --> 00:45:05,786
Which one?

441
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,047
The bed or the floor?

442
00:45:18,257 --> 00:45:19,341
The floor.

443
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,719
You can sleep on the bed.

444
00:45:22,803 --> 00:45:24,388
I'm not sleeping here.

445
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:26,473
I'm going to sleep in the truck.

446
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,610
Call me if you need anything.

447
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:59,756
Why didn't you ever apologize to me?

448
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,720
Judging by what you said to Jong-u,

449
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,724
it seemed like you were aware

450
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:13,479
of how difficult my life was
because of you.

451
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,191
Tell me.

452
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,318
Do you even feel sorry?

453
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:23,947
Do you really feel sorry
about how you mistreated me

454
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:26,158
and hurt me?

455
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:31,580
Why should I…

456
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:35,125
feel sorry about you?

457
00:47:17,459 --> 00:47:19,253
GONGWONSANG INN

458
00:48:34,036 --> 00:48:36,997
SAGOL TRIPE

459
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:39,458
Take good care of yourself.

460
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:14,242
I packed you some meat
from our restaurant.

461
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,914
Who's going to eat that?

462
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:21,458
The old lady has cancer, so she can't.

463
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,378
And why would I eat
anything from you? Get out.

464
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,380
Jong-u called me last night

465
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:29,341
and told me that your mother was sick.

466
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,302
He was upset and didn't know what to say.

467
00:49:33,387 --> 00:49:35,764
Had he known,
he wouldn't have behaved that way.

468
00:49:38,975 --> 00:49:40,560
But is it okay for your mother

469
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,313
to be out and about like this?

470
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,357
Shouldn't she be at a hospital?

471
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:48,235
Try convincing her yourself.
See if she listens.

472
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,705
Call me

473
00:50:01,206 --> 00:50:04,126
-when you hold a funeral.
-Let me make myself clear.

474
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,337
You and Jong-u
aren't invited to the funeral.

475
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,392
We were both young,

476
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:24,438
and life was hard for all of us.

477
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:06,146
SUNGANG REAL ESTATE

478
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:18,784
The realtor doesn't know
the names of the old towns here

479
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:20,869
because he's from Seoul.

480
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,164
The names changed
after the city got redeveloped.

481
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:28,376
Let's go to the village
and ask the old people there.

482
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,754
If they also don't know,
let's head back to Jeju.

483
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,717
What's so special about Madang-ri anyway?

484
00:51:36,510 --> 00:51:37,928
It's my hometown.

485
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,680
I thought Jeju was your hometown.

486
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:58,448
YUNGOK 2-RI VILLAGE HALL

487
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,342
MAN

488
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:22,222
YUNGOK 2-RI VILLAGE HALL

489
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,107
Madang-ri's gone.

490
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:37,320
How can a village just disappear?

491
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:40,156
They turned it into a reservoir.

492
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,827
It used to be up that mountain,
but it's a reservoir now.

493
00:52:45,871 --> 00:52:47,163
Where to now?

494
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,251
Tell me. Where should we go?

495
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,169
Let's go to Madang-ri.

496
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,463
Why would we go to a reservoir?

497
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,716
You won't be able to find anything there.

498
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:07,934
We can't even drive there.
We'll have to walk.

499
00:53:08,810 --> 00:53:09,936
I'm hungry.

500
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,439
Let's eat first and think about it.

501
00:53:14,024 --> 00:53:15,442
What do you want for lunch?

502
00:53:17,819 --> 00:53:20,488
-Doenjang, your favorite.
-I don't eat it anymore.

503
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:25,994
I don't eat that stuff anymore.

504
00:53:26,077 --> 00:53:28,872
Choose something else.
Or we can eat separately.

505
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,043
-Jajangmyeon.
-Jajangmyeon?

506
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:39,007
Just eat doenjang by yourself.
Jajangmyeon is hard to digest.

507
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,967
Let's eat jajangmyeon.

508
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:51,311
Well, it's not like you'll stay alive
for longer if you don't eat that stuff.

509
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,037
What's your name?

510
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:12,207
My name is Kang Ok-dong.

511
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,918
Is your name Puppy?

512
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:16,962
Is it Coal?

513
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:18,838
Is it Ash?

514
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,423
CHINESE RESTAURANT

515
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:21,967
Where's your mommy?

516
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:27,347
Where's your mommy?
Why are you here all by yourself?

517
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:29,224
Why?

518
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,313
She's smiling at a dog?

519
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:38,942
Come inside. I got us a table.

520
00:54:40,026 --> 00:54:41,861
I ordered jajangmyeon.

521
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:45,156
I need to go.

522
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:48,535
I'm off now. Bye.

523
00:54:52,747 --> 00:54:53,665
Come on!

524
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:55,875
That crazy bastard.

525
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,795
Why don't you pay attention
when you cross the road?

526
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,255
That car could have hit you!

527
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:10,765
She never once looked at me properly
in my entire life.

528
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,184
But she smiles at even dogs.

529
00:55:16,813 --> 00:55:19,774
Welcome. Come this way.

530
00:55:25,155 --> 00:55:27,282
We have two jjamppongs.

531
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:36,833
Here's your seafood jjajangmyeon.

532
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,836
Here you go. Enjoy.

533
00:55:39,919 --> 00:55:41,421
Excuse me, we came…

534
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:43,089
We came first.

535
00:55:43,173 --> 00:55:45,216
They came after us. Bring us our food.

536
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:49,220
Goodness, I must've made a mistake.

537
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:53,725
What the hell…

538
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:59,230
Don't let it bother you, Mr. Son.
Enjoy your food. I'm sorry.

539
00:56:00,607 --> 00:56:03,276
I'll give you something on the house.

540
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:04,569
Who asked for that?

541
00:56:04,652 --> 00:56:06,279
Just give us what we ordered.

542
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,408
You disrespected me first.

543
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:12,077
Now, bring us our food.

544
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,584
This is ordinary jajangmyeon.

545
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:22,420
I ordered seafood jajangmyeon.

546
00:56:23,505 --> 00:56:24,422
Right.

547
00:56:25,507 --> 00:56:26,758
Please wait.

548
00:56:38,269 --> 00:56:40,355
I'm sorry.

549
00:56:41,147 --> 00:56:42,232
I'm sorry.

550
00:56:42,857 --> 00:56:44,609
I'm sorry…

551
00:56:44,692 --> 00:56:47,570
What are you being sorry for?
We did nothing wrong!

552
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:50,115
Where are you going?
Let's eat jajangmyeon!

553
00:56:50,824 --> 00:56:52,158
Let's just go.

554
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,270
Watch your hand.

555
00:57:33,241 --> 00:57:34,451
Fasten your seat belt.

556
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:58,725
You smile so easily at a damn puppy.

557
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,437
But you were nothing but cold to me
your entire life.

558
00:58:04,564 --> 00:58:07,066
Despite not doing
anything wrong to anyone,

559
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:09,235
you always act like you did.

560
00:58:11,696 --> 00:58:14,782
Yet you say you don't owe me an apology?

561
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:19,120
How are you not sorry to me?

562
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,290
You wronged me in every way.

563
00:58:30,715 --> 00:58:32,300
Fine. Let's go to Madang-ri.

564
00:58:34,135 --> 00:58:35,803
Once we're done with that,

565
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,806
I'm done doing things for you.

566
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:43,811
Then it'll be my turn. You just wait.

567
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,952
Why did you want to come here?

568
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:43,413
To visit your parents' graves?

569
00:59:49,168 --> 00:59:51,379
You're all skin and bones now.

570
00:59:53,506 --> 00:59:54,924
Baengnokdam Lake looks

571
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,635
more marvelous than this, right?

572
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:05,643
I'll go to the peak and take a photo

573
01:00:05,727 --> 01:00:07,478
of Baengnokdam Lake covered in snow.

574
01:00:08,938 --> 01:00:10,815
If you reincarnate,

575
01:00:12,191 --> 01:00:14,485
would you want to be my mom again?

576
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:20,199
Don't bother to hold a funeral for me.

577
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:23,494
And don't mourn for me either.

578
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,251
Mom.

579
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:33,796
PUREUNG BUS STOP

580
01:00:35,882 --> 01:00:40,887
