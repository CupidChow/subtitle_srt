EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

6
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,385
Did you eat?

7
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:17,906
Move aside! Handcart coming through!

8
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,115
Sir! Watch out!

9
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:20,617
Out of the way!

10
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:26,164
Handcart coming through!

11
00:03:30,126 --> 00:03:32,879
Okay, guys. Here's your ice.

12
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:35,256
-Ice.
-Thanks.

13
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,552
That's fresh squid right there.
Take a look.

14
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,679
Take a look and make a bid.

15
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:50,021
It's nice and fresh.
All right. 54,000 won.

16
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,524
How do they look?

17
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,693
Not good enough.

18
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:58,238
Darn it.
Then should we just buy frozen fish?

19
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,281
And lose credibility?

20
00:04:02,158 --> 00:04:03,368
Do whatever you want then.

21
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:05,745
I see 56,000 won. Number 40.

22
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:08,373
Sold. Now, let's move on to mackerel.

Mackerel.

24
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,545
We'll begin with mackerel.

25
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:16,464
-How does 54,000 won sound?
-Numbers!

26
00:04:16,547 --> 00:04:18,174
-Mackerel.
-Let's play it safe.

27
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:19,467
Show us your numbers.

28
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,469
-How about 56,000 won?
-Numbers!

29
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:23,096
Best quality mackerel.

All right. 56,000 won. Number 8.

34
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:34,607
Sold. Number 8 gets it at 56,000 won.

35
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,070
Those are from the Woori.

36
00:04:39,153 --> 00:04:41,531
They're nice and fresh. Great quality.

37
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:43,283
Show us some generous numbers.

38
00:04:43,366 --> 00:04:45,868
They're from the Woori. Cutlass hairtails.

39

Put them inside.

53
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,993
I want them in a straight line.

54
00:05:58,441 --> 00:06:00,193
Hey, guys. Get in.

55
00:06:00,818 --> 00:06:03,905
I told you to hurry.
Why are you always so late?

56
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:05,573
Sorry.

57
00:06:05,656 --> 00:06:07,533
Gosh, seriously.

JEONJIN 1

60
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:50,868
Don't swim right beside me like a leech.
It's annoying.

61
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,037
I won't. This is for your nausea.

62
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,999
Stop trying to suck up to Chun-hui too.

63
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:58,876
-Just leave her alone.
-Got it.

64
00:07:06,342 --> 00:07:08,928
Yeong-ok, don't listen to Hye-ja.

65
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:12,431
If we don't swim with Chun-hui,
we'll end up with conches again.

66
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:23,067
Hey, Captain.

67
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:27,238
Did you eat?

68
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,177
Hey, Yeong-ok!

69
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,220
Captain Bae!

70
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:55,016
Hey! Yeong-ok!

71
00:07:56,517 --> 00:08:00,480
Look over here! Hey, Yeong-ok!

72
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:03,399
She goes around talking
to every man she lays eyes on.

73
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,318
-That darn coquette.
-Hey, Yeong-ok!

74
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,737
We should kick her off the boat, Chun-hui.

75
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,156
We never should have
let her on the boat anyway.

76
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,200
Everything she says seems like a lie.

77
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,499
How would you feel if I dated Yeong-ok?

78
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:26,339
Forget it unless it's just for fun.

79
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:28,049
She's not your type.

80
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:30,843
She's the type
who goes around hitting on everyone.

81
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,934
Jeonjin 1.

87
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:54,492

JEONJIN 1

89
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,368
Come and buy hairtail fillets!

90
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,869
Two hairtails coming right up.

91
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:03,788
Can you help her out?

92
00:11:03,871 --> 00:11:04,705
-Hello.
-How much?

93
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,666
Hairtail costs 30,000 won per pack.

94
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,459
Please wait. I'll be right with you.

95
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,877
-Receive their order.
-Got it.

96
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,045
Hey, stop.

97
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:14,590
Don't touch the fish
if you're not going to buy it.

98
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,717
This looks like the best one.

99
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:18,928
I'll buy this for 15,000 won.

100
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,347
-No. 20,000 won.
-Then 17,000 won.

101
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,640
Don't touch it.

102
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:25,810
Just go. I'm not going to sell it.

103
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:27,937
You've got to be kidding me.

104
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,941
If you want it at a cheap price,
why don't you just go catch one yourself?

105
00:11:32,024 --> 00:11:33,275
Goodness, what a temper.

106
00:11:33,359 --> 00:11:35,861
Okay, fine. 18,000 won.

107

EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

108
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,454
If you buy 2,
you can have it at 19,000 won each.

109
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,457
That's the lowest I can go. Okay?

Hello, sir. We're from SS Bank.

114
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,932
Hello, we're from SS Bank.

115

Please come and get a consultation.

116
00:12:07,017 --> 00:12:08,144
Please…

117
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:13,941
Hello, we're from SS Bank.

118
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:17,987
We're here to promote
a new customized product.

119
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:20,114

BRANCH MANAGER CHOI HAN-SU

124
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:17,254
Hey, Hyeong-sik.

125
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,926
Did you ask your wife?

126
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:24,094
Well, yes. The thing is…

127
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,265
I'm so sorry. She thinks it's a bad idea
to lend money to friends.

128
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:30,726
She says we'll fall apart
if you don't pay us back.

129
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,020
I assured her that we could trust you,

130
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,730
but she's completely against it.

131
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,358
She even threatened to get a divorce.

132
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,860
-I'm really sorry.
-Oh, I see.

133
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,155
But listen, Han-su.
Do what you can to get that money.

134
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:46,367
Then invest that money
in Orang Electronics.

135
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,035
If you buy that,

136
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:50,788
your money will easily double
in a couple of months.

137
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:53,207
If you invest 200 million,
it'll become 400 million.

138
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:57,294
I'm only sharing this information
because we go way back.

139
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:01,131
Yes, I know.
I know you're doing me a favor.

140
00:14:02,132 --> 00:14:05,719
Hyeong-sik, I'm actually busy packing
because I got transferred.

141
00:14:06,595 --> 00:14:08,389
Can we talk again next time?

142
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,767
Okay, thanks. Bye.

143
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:39,086
Do you think money grows on trees?

144
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:41,463
You lost me 20 million won,
so lose the attitude!

145
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,508
Why do you keep going back on your word?

146
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,677
What is this? A joke?

147
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,346
I was never like that, sir.

148
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,183
The recommended product
did not guarantee the principal,

149
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,020
and I told you many times
that it was a high-risk product.

150
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,105
No, you didn't! You never said that!

151
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:00,107
-Sir, please.
-You never told me that!

152
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:02,318
-Please stop.
-Let go of me.

153
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,777
-Calm down, sir.
-Get off me.

154
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:05,946
-Sir, please. Stop.
-Let go.

155
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,615
-Please stop.
-Hey, get off.

156
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,700
-Get off me.
-Sir.

157
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,245
Sir, calm down. Try to relax.

158
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,624
Now, let's go talk in my office.

159
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,460
You were in there all along,
and this is when you decided to show up?

160
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:21,545
Do you think little of me too?

161
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:23,088
Goodness, sir.

162
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,382
Don't be ridiculous.

163
00:15:25,466 --> 00:15:28,552
We would never dare
to think little of you, sir.

164
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,888
You made profit
during the first two quarters

165
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:33,432
and were happy about your interest rate.

166
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,768
But now, you're furious at us

167
00:15:35,851 --> 00:15:38,103
-for losing a bit of money.
-Mr. Kim, enough!

168
00:15:38,187 --> 00:15:39,521
-You punk!
-Sir!

169
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,856
-How dare you!
-Sir.

170
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,149
-I'll kill you.
-Sir.

171
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,609
-Calm down. Let go of him.
-I'll…

172
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,110
-Sir.
-Sir, calm down.

173
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,487
Don't get so worked up.

174
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:48,238
Who do you think you are?

175
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:50,407
-You little punk!
-Come with me.

176
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,703
The owner of the butcher shop
also invested 500 million won

177
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,330
because you convinced him to!

178
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,332
But listen to what you're saying now!

179
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,459
-I'll explain, sir.
-You coaxed us!

180
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,212
I invested 180 million,
and he turned it into 160 million!

181
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,005
He should be apologizing!

182
00:16:05,089 --> 00:16:06,799
Goodness. Calm down.

183
00:16:06,882 --> 00:16:09,385
You need to be careful
of your high blood pressure.

184
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,473
Let me get you a cup of tea.
Wait here for a moment.

185
00:16:14,556 --> 00:16:16,642
I'm just really upset. That's all.

186
00:16:16,725 --> 00:16:17,685
I know.

187
00:16:17,768 --> 00:16:21,939
I'll explain everything.
Wait here until I come back.

188
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:27,653
BRANCH MANAGER'S OFFICE

189
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,787
Mr. Kim.

190
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:40,749
Hold your anger.

191
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:44,628
You can all go home now.

192
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,047
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

193
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,389
I'll do it.

194
00:16:57,433 --> 00:16:59,893
Don't give him a cold drink.

195
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,105
Give him a hot cup of tea.

196
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:05,357
Hot enough to burn his mouth.

197
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,693
So hot that he won't
be able to gulp it down.

198
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:11,655
Blowing on his tea to cool it down

199
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:14,199
will help him blow off some steam.

200
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,327
What happened to your toe?

201
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,830
Don't worry about it.

202
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,042
I'm sorry, sir.

203
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:27,421
I should have just apologized
instead of getting angry.

204
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:32,009
Let's just say
I'm doing you a favor before I leave.

205
00:17:39,266 --> 00:17:41,602
Gosh, that's hot. Damn it.

206
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:44,438
Drink it slowly.

207
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,065
Listen.

208
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,818
I need to work like a dog for six months
to make 20 million won.

209
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,654
But the bank, of all places,

210
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:54,948
lost that money overnight.
It's just absurd.

211
00:17:55,616 --> 00:17:56,867
Mr. Choi.

212
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:59,328
Say something already.

213
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,747
I want an explanation.

214
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,749
I know you're upset.

215
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:06,376
I understand.
If I were you, I'd be upset too.

216
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,337
I really don't know what to say.

217
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,172
Jeez, I really can't believe this.

218
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,301
So…

219
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,845
here's what I think.

220
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,224
The product you invested in

221
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,394
will mature in two days,
so instead of extending it,

222
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,481
invest that money in something else.

223
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,402
CAPITAL GUARANTEE FUND

224
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,781
Why don't you switch
to a safer capital guarantee fund?

225
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,868
It offers a very high-interest rate.

226
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,288
It's a new product,
and you'll be the first investor.

227
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:45,958
Is that so?

228
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,252
-Yes.
-I'll be the first?

229
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:50,295
Yes.

230
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:56,844
-Goodness. You should be careful.
-Gosh.

231
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:01,557
Here. Wipe it with this.

232
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,937
If you're worried, send us some money.

233
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,149
You send all your money to your family.

234
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:14,027
You're the eldest son,
but you make me take care of Mom

235
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,655
and only send us
200 to 300 thousand won a month.

236
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,323
Is this the best you can do?

237
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,159
Put Mom on the phone.

238
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,369
I'm getting transferred early next month.

239
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,288
I haven't been able to visit,

240
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,248
so I'd like to talk to her.

241
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,750
She's sleeping.

242
00:19:55,777 --> 00:20:00,657
It looks like she's been
swinging duck hooks ever since last year.

243
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:03,952
No wonder the ball keeps
flying to the left.

244
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:05,787
My gosh.

245
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:21,511
MI-JIN

246
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:23,180
Hey.

247
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,015
How have you been?

248
00:20:25,098 --> 00:20:28,227
Even if I scrape up everything I have,
it'll only be 80 million won.

249
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,688
That's around 66,000 to 67,000 dollars.

250
00:20:31,772 --> 00:20:34,858
With her away on a match,
it'll last her less than five months.

251
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,737
Honey, let's just call it quits.

252
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:41,448
She couldn't even make it
to the top 50 in Division 2.

253
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:43,158
Next year won't get any better.

254
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:46,536
She's only been like this
for half a year because of yips.

255
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:49,748
Before that, lots of Division One coaches
showed interest in her.

256
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,042
We've done enough.

257
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:56,880
I don't want to drive around the US
in a car anymore.

258
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:58,298
I'm scared.

259
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,843
We can't even afford
to turn on the heater.

260
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,888
It's cold here, and I'm only getting old.

261
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,725
Did Coach Steve call?

262
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,729
You said you sent him
Bo-ram's practice clips and game clips.

263
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,022
What did he say?

264
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:17,901
Tell me. What did he say?

265
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:22,364
I have no one else to borrow money from.

266
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:29,454
Do you know
what all the other Koreans call us here?

267
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,540
"Clink."

268
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:35,711
It means we're penniless
and that Bo-ram is a spendthrift.

269
00:21:38,088 --> 00:21:41,550
We barely managed to get a loan,
you got an early retirement benefit,

270
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,761
and we even sold our house
to financially support her.

271
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:48,015
Haven't we done enough?

272
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:52,060
Just tell me what
Park In-bee's former coach said.

273
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,647
Can he fix Bo-ram's yips or not?

274
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,151
What did Steve say?

275
00:22:00,569 --> 00:22:03,989
Her lessons are going to cost us
15,000 dollars a month.

276
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,243
She needs it for at least a year.

277
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,664
Even if she only eats burgers,

278
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,125
we'll still have to pay for other things,

279
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,711
which adds up to 300 to 400 million won.

280
00:22:20,297 --> 00:22:22,299
We don't even own a house anymore.

281
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,384
Are you going to retire?

282
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,345
What a great idea.

283
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:30,640
Just spend the rest
of your severance pay on Bo-ram.

284
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,810
If she doesn't make it,
we'll just be homeless.

285
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,604
Sounds like a great idea.

286
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,274
Judging by your anger,

287
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:43,820
I'm guessing Steve told you
Bo-ram still has potential.

288
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:55,290
Bo-ram is our last hope.

289
00:22:56,249 --> 00:22:59,503
Mi-jin, let's hang in there
for a bit longer.

290
00:23:00,587 --> 00:23:03,256
I'll do what I can to get the money.

291
00:23:04,007 --> 00:23:05,717
You'd better not retire.

292
00:23:06,384 --> 00:23:07,886
I can't do this anymore.

293
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,806
I've been in the States for seven years.

294
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:14,184
Come on. Bo-ram doesn't want to give up.

295
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:17,395
Golf means everything to her.

296
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:19,564
We can't just give up. We're her parents.

297
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,777
Darn it.

298
00:23:27,197 --> 00:23:28,490
Gosh.

299
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,039
When are you getting transferred
to Pureung, Jeju?

300
00:23:37,499 --> 00:23:38,792
Next week.

301
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:43,338
It's your hometown.
You'll get to see your friends.

302
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,342
Friends, my foot.
I haven't seen them for dozens of years.

303
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,813
Sharp turn 300m ahead.

304
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:33,365
Come on!
What are you going to do about this?

305
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,408
Why would you reverse your truck?

306
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:38,245
-I didn't.
-Don't lie to me!

307
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,666
I crashed into you
because you moved your truck!

308
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,585
My truck was parked there.

309
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,338
You made a sharp turn
and crashed into my truck.

310
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,382
-Am I wrong?
-What are you saying?

311
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,842
I was making a right turn,

312
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,972
and you suddenly
reversed your beat-up truck, you tramp!

313
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,974
You scratched my car!

314
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,352
-What did you say?
-What?

315
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:05,939
-Did you just call me a tramp?
-Yes, you old--

316
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:07,816
I'll pluck your eyes out.

317
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,402
Damn you.

318
00:26:10,485 --> 00:26:14,114
I was going to be nice,
but you just had to

319
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:17,784
keep running your damn mouth,
you asshole. Listen to me.

320
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,955
I'll carve out your intestines
and do jump ropes with it

321
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,332
or stretch out your prostate
like a clothesline.

322
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:26,251
Who the hell do you think you are

323
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,795
-to get on my nerves?
-A lady shouldn't talk like that.

324
00:26:29,337 --> 00:26:31,131
-Get out of my way.
-Gosh.

325
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:33,091
Who do you think you are?

326
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:36,344
You little peanut.
You really need to learn your lesson.

327
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:38,388
My gosh.

328
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,765
-I might as well just…
-Hit me. Go ahead.

329
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,559
-Gosh, you little…
-That's enough.

330
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:45,186
-Eun-hui, let's just go.
-That punk.

331
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,440
You should go too.
Let's just go our separate ways.

332
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:50,734
What an unlucky day.

333
00:26:50,817 --> 00:26:53,445
Those damn morons. Move your truck!

334
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:55,572
That little… Let me go.

335
00:26:56,281 --> 00:26:58,325
What are you all looking at?

336
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,994
-Stop staring and go.
-Hey, don't take that off.

337
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:02,287
So annoying.

338
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,080
My gosh.

339
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:06,249
Go easy on him.

340
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:09,669
Goodness.

341
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,257
What? What do you want?

342
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,009
"Moron"?

343
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,472
How could she crash into your car
when the engine was turned off?

344
00:27:20,555 --> 00:27:23,808
You bigheaded idiotic jerk.

345
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,686
I wanted to end things amicably,

346
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:29,314
but you called me a moron?

347
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,193
Do you even know what a moron is?

348
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,320
A moron refers to guys like you

349
00:27:35,403 --> 00:27:39,324
who have no respect
for those who are older than them.

350
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,495
You keep cussing at us,
but you should be cussing at yourself.

351
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:46,206
You ugly, beer-bellied punk!

352
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,624
-Hey, stop…
-You bastard.

353
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:49,667
Oh, my goodness.

354
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:52,545
-You asshole!
-My gosh, come on.

355
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,299
What? Is this blood? My nose is bleeding!

356
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:57,425
Move your car!

357
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,594
Why were you standing there?

358
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:01,638
-Were you bored?
-Hey. Where are you going?

359
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:03,223
Come here, you punk. Don't move.

360
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,349
We have witnesses.

361
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,600
-Move!
-Call the cops.

362
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:08,061
-My gosh.
-Get out of your car.

363
00:28:08,144 --> 00:28:09,604
Hey, stop filming me.

364
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,272
Officer Oh. It's me, Eun-hui.

365
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:12,732
-He's a witness.
-It's Eun-hui!

366
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,651
-My gosh!
-I'm at Pureung Intersection.

367
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,861
There's been an assault. Get over here.

368
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:18,530
-Film his face.
-My gosh.

369
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,948
Hand him over to the cops.

370
00:28:20,031 --> 00:28:22,075
I'll kill you if you don't.

371
00:28:22,158 --> 00:28:23,410
Just get going already.

372
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,995
My gosh, will you get off?

373
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:28,164
Hey! Get out of your car!

374
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,582
Come here, you punk.

375
00:28:29,666 --> 00:28:31,668
Do you see that?

376
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:34,671
Your dad's nose is bleeding,
and Hyeon's dad is shirtless.

377
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,381
-He's a witness.
-My gosh.

378
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,341
They're so hilarious.

379
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:40,593
-My gosh, look.
-You should film him too.

380
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:43,596
-Stop filming!
-You'd better start using honorifics.

381
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:47,517
Hurry up and call the cops again.

382
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,561
Get off me. Stop filming me.

383
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,104
He's a witness.

384
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,564
Hey, come here.

385
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,358
You should film him too.

386
00:28:55,442 --> 00:28:58,069
-Stop filming me!
-Who told you to drop the honorifics?

387
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,112
Come here.

388
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:01,906
Stop right there, you punk.

389
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,074
Where are you going?

390
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,952
You're not going anywhere
until you compensate for this.

391
00:29:06,035 --> 00:29:08,663
I'm sorry. Move the car.

392
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,956
Come on, guys.

393
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,208
-Tell them to go this way.
-They can't.

394
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,252
-Damn it. Fine.
-I'm sorry.

395
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:15,378
Move your car, please.

396
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,556
They're exactly the same.

397
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:28,850
Hey, come here.

398
00:29:29,517 --> 00:29:31,561
They haven't changed at all.

399
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,157
We've arrived at Biyangdo Harbor.

400
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,743
Those who have onboarded with vehicles,

401
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:50,997
please follow the given orders
and disembark in an orderly fashion.

402
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,416
I repeat.

00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,835
Those who have onboarded with vehicles,

404
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,839
please follow the given orders
and disembark in an orderly fashion.

405
00:30:00,715 --> 00:30:03,468
The remaining passengers, please come down

406
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:08,014
and wait for the vehicles to disembark,
then leave the ship in an orderly fashion.

407
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,768
Right.

408
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:15,772
Gosh, will you cut it out?

409
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,982
Okay.

410
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,235
I'm going.

411
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:23,279

Soft tofu.

00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,985
Bean curd dregs.

418
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:05,321

Pliers, hammers, and screwdrivers.

422

Tops and shorts.

424
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,627
Tops and shorts.

425
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,364
I'll be on my way soon.

426
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:50,283
Just wait a little bit.

427
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,578
This is all just to make a living.

428
00:31:53,661 --> 00:31:54,746
Move your truck!

429
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,956
I need to cut in. Please.

430
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,459
-My gosh.
-Gosh, what's going on?

431
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:02,128
It won't take long. I just need to cut in.

432
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:03,296
Get out of the way!

433
00:32:03,379 --> 00:32:05,632
I'm really sorry. I'm sorry.

434
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,759
Can't you just drive through?

435
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,720
-What's your problem?
-My gosh, sir. Please.

436
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,597
I'm sorry. I'm trying to make a living.

437
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,015
I'm sorry.

438
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:16,976
-Move it!
-Goodness.

439
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:23,191
Hey! You…

440
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,777
Is that you, Han-su?

441
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,863
Let's go already! Move your truck!

Will you please move your truck already?

446
00:32:36,162 --> 00:32:38,706
-What are you doing?
-Just a second.

447
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,459
I just met a friend
I haven't seen for 20 years!

448
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:44,796
Eun-hui, you should go.
I'll call you soon.

449
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,547
Are you here on vacation?

450
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,299
When are you going back to Seoul?

451
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:50,093
Do you know my number?

452
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,386

Sales is much easier here
than it is in Seoul.

476
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:38,242
Yes, you have a point.

477
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:40,828

481
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:54,926
-You mean Eun-hui from high school?
-Yes.

482
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:59,722
Let's get going.
You should say hello to our clients.

483
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,307
Come on.

484
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:06,479
Goodness.

485
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:18,074
NAYEONG COSMETICS
SIUL PHARMACY

486
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,242
Goodbye.

487
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,536
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

488
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:22,829
Hello.

489
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:25,665
-Hello.
-He just got transferred here.

490
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:29,418
-Hello.
-Hello, I'm from SS Bank.

491
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,505
I'm from SS Bank. Hello, everyone.

492
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:36,134
-Hello.
-Hello, ma'am. I'm from SS Bank.

493
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,302
Hello, ma'am. I look forward to--

494
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:39,971
-He's the union president.
-What?

495
00:35:40,054 --> 00:35:42,056
Goodness. Hello.

496
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,475
-Hello.
-Hi.

497
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,310
I'm from SS Bank.

498
00:35:46,394 --> 00:35:48,104
Feel free to come for a consultation.

499
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,648
You'll receive our best care
and attention, sir.

500
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,526
Born and raised in Pureung, Seogwipo.

501
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,361
A top student at Changmun High.

502
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,654
Seoul National University!

503
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,698
No, I mean…

504
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:00,324
A prestigious university in Seoul.

505
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,659
He's back in his hometown!

506
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,703
I hope you all welcome him
with excitement.

507
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,583
-It's nice to meet you all.
-Welcome back.

508
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,209
Let's welcome him, everyone.

509
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,170
I'm from SS Bank, ma'am.

510
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:15,464
I'm from SS Bank. It's nice to meet you.

511
00:36:15,548 --> 00:36:16,966
-Nice to meet--
-Here.

512
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:18,968
There.

513
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:24,140
There's also this place and that place.

514
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,642
Are they all our clients?

515
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:27,810
My gosh.

516
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,731
What is it? Tell me.

517
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,443
Hello, I'm from SS Bank.
It's nice to meet you.

518
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,611
What is it?

519
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,363
Hello, I'm from SS Bank.

520
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:43,492
Lastly, that one over there.

521
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:46,871
What about them?

522
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:51,834
The five shops that you just saw
all belong to Eun-hui.

523
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,171
What would you like? Hairtail?

524
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:57,882
It's 50,000 won for three.

525
00:36:57,965 --> 00:36:59,342
You want three?

526
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:00,551
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

527
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,220
Okay, three hairtails. Hold on.

528
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:04,472
-What do you need?
-Some squid.

529
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,641
Okay, squid. Just a second.

530
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,477
She earns over 15 million won
a month, just by rent.

531
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:12,104
She sells fish here and in Jeju City.

532
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:16,567
She makes 2.3 billion won a year
just by selling fish in the market.

533
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,818
After she pays her staff,

534
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:20,905
she's left with a net income
of over 300 million won every year.

535
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:22,782
I see.

536
00:37:25,201 --> 00:37:27,453
What does her husband do?
Do they work together?

537
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,372
Who would marry her?

538
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:32,416
She's too scary.
She runs the business on her own.

539
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,795
Do you think she's single
because she still isn't over you?

540
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:38,881
Gosh, don't be absurd.

541
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:43,427
Who knows what would have happened
if you were still single?

542
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,723
Why isn't Eun-hui here?

543
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,809
She's busy.

544
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:53,354
She delivers goods
to all the supermarkets in this town.

545
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:54,897
She makes dried fish

546
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,900
for Ms. Kang and Ms. Hyeon
to sell at the market.

547
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,319
Then there's this shop
and the one in Jeju City.

548
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,696
Oh, right.

549
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:05,533
She even owns that coffee shop building
in front of your studio.

550
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,203
If she didn't have to give any money
to her younger siblings,

551
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,957
she would have owned a building each
in both downtown Seogwipo and Jeju City.

552
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,001
Amazing, right?

553
00:38:19,922 --> 00:38:21,716
What about In-gwon and Ho-sik?

554
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,510
Gosh, those punks are broke.

555
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,346
They took out a loan from our bank
to start their businesses.

556
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,806
Right.

557
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:33,102
The head office keeps telling us
to sell investment products,

558
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:35,438
but Eun-hui won't even blink an eye.

559
00:38:35,521 --> 00:38:38,816
All she does with her money
is just keep it safe in the bank.

560
00:38:38,899 --> 00:38:41,235
She never invests or spends any of it.

561
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,571
You have no idea how frustrating it is.

562
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,158
Listen. When you meet her
at the reunion this Friday,

563
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:50,411
do everything you can to win her over
and make her invest that money.

564
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:51,620
Okay?

565
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:55,291
What do you think she is?
Some sort of prize for the taking?

566
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:56,792
She's not a trophy.

567
00:38:56,876 --> 00:39:00,421
Gosh, will you listen to that?
Nice come back.

568
00:39:00,504 --> 00:39:03,215
You remind me of back
when you used to go around fighting.

569
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:05,885
Where are we headed next?

570
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:08,346
All right, sir. Let me lead the way.

571
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,934
Oh, right. We're about to visit
the gas station owner and his wife.

572
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:17,188
Their daughter also plays golf
in the States just like Bo-ram.

573
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:20,107
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

574
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,067
I see.

575
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,451
Watch out for wild animals.

576
00:39:30,534 --> 00:39:32,370
Please drive carefully.

577
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,257
Gosh, this farm is huge.

578
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:47,968
It's nice to finally see it in person.

579
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,845
I bet it was hard for you.

580
00:39:51,514 --> 00:39:53,140
Did you visit Mom before coming?

581
00:39:55,309 --> 00:39:58,687
No, I was too busy to visit.

582
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:03,359
I had dinner with her last month.

583
00:40:03,442 --> 00:40:05,569
I had a long conversation with her.

584
00:40:06,445 --> 00:40:08,739
Mom's doing well.

585
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,910
How about your wife?
Is she still in the States?

586
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:19,166
Bo-ram still needs to study more.

587
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:23,337
It's almost over. Just one more year.

588
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:25,840
Once Bo-ram succeeds,

589
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:31,137
I promise I'll pay more attention
to you, Mom, and Han-yeong.

590
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,221
Study, my foot.

591
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:34,765
You sold your house
just so she could play golf.

592
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,394
Our family could barely afford
to send you to Seoul.

593
00:40:39,061 --> 00:40:41,397
Han-yeong and I are
both high school graduates.

594
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,985
Meanwhile, you can't even
take care of Mom.

595
00:40:49,488 --> 00:40:50,823
I don't know what to say.

596
00:40:51,407 --> 00:40:53,993
Of course, you don't know what to say.

597
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,585
Did you eat?

598
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:05,421
Not yet.

599
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,299
I'd love to eat with you,

600
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:11,218
but we couldn't cook anything
because we have so much work.

601
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,388
Gosh, that's fine.

602
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,434
By the way, my mom's coming over tonight.

603
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:21,020
Okay, I'll head home as soon as I'm done.

604
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,703
I'll see you next time.

605
00:41:38,287 --> 00:41:40,664
I live in Jeju now, so I'll visit often.

606
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:44,376
Here. I'll put these here.

607
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,467
Bye, guys. Don't see me off.

608
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,136
Bye, Han-suk.

609
00:42:24,625 --> 00:42:28,087
HAN-SUK…

610
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:36,554
HAN-SUK, I'M SORRY BUT CAN I BORROW
A HUNDRED MILLION WON…

611
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,435
GALLERY
BO-RAM'S TOURNAMENTS

612
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,367
Myeong-bo told me
that you moved to Jeju Island.

613
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:42,453
I'm glad you're here, my first love.

614
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,414
Are you coming to the reunion?

615
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:48,667
You'd better come.
I can't wait to meet my first love again.

616
00:44:18,238 --> 00:44:21,200
She even owns that coffee shop building
in front of your studio.

617
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:25,621
If she didn't have to give any money
to her younger siblings,

618
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:30,250
she would have owned a building each
in both downtown Seogwipo and Jeju City.

619
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:31,919
Amazing, right?

620
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:37,925
What have I been doing with my life?
I don't even own a single building.

621
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,266
I raised you, you punk.

622
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,435
Right?

623
00:44:58,612 --> 00:45:00,364
My goodness.

624
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:03,784
I'm so jealous.

625
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:07,329
I really am.

626
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:36,650
What are you looking at?

627
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,610
-Gosh.
-Let's go.

628
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:45,993
-What is that?
-Goodness, that noise.

629
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:48,829
My goodness, what is she carrying?

630
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:52,166
Goodness, that smell.

631
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:54,668
-Is that a pig?
-Look at that.

632
00:45:54,751 --> 00:45:56,753
-I can't believe it.
-Gross.

633
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:59,298
You really are something.

634
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,683
Gosh. Han-su, Eun-hui.

635
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,019
Aren't you guys headed to school?

636
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,896
What's with the pig and the sack?

637
00:46:14,605 --> 00:46:16,231
Is it to pay for the field trip?

638
00:46:16,899 --> 00:46:18,734
Stop it.

639
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:21,778
Han-su, what are you going to sell
to pay for the field trip?

640
00:46:22,571 --> 00:46:24,281
Sesame seeds? Millets?

641
00:46:25,532 --> 00:46:26,700
Sorghum?

642
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:27,701
PLANT PRODUCT SACK

643
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:30,412
-Stop it.
-What? I'm just asking.

644
00:46:33,499 --> 00:46:34,583
Sesame seeds.

645
00:46:35,083 --> 00:46:36,543
He's going to sell sesame seeds.

646
00:46:36,627 --> 00:46:38,504
-Did you hear that?
-What do you have?

647
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,756
Gosh, that's hilarious.

648
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,424
It's so funny.

649
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:45,719
It'd be a waste to sell that pig.
Don't sell it.

650
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:48,388
You bitch.

651
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:50,224
You little…

652
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:51,934
Sit down.

653
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,853
Don't sit down. Fight.

654
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,688
-Fight!
-Fight!

655
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,941
-Fight!
-Fight!

656
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:00,317
-Fight!
-Fight!

657
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,111
-Fight!
-Fight!

658
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,448
Sit down.

659
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:10,911
Gosh.

660
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,413
I'm only sitting down because I want to.

661
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,902
All right.

662
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:57,082
Gosh, look at the sea. So nice.

663
00:47:57,165 --> 00:48:00,085
And then what? Is that it?

664
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:08,552
-Of course not. There's more.
-Really?

665
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:09,761
Well, keep going.

666
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,055
So in the end,

667
00:48:13,015 --> 00:48:15,434
we went on a field trip to Mokpo.

668
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:34,036
Everyone headed to Mount Yudal
now that we have free time.

669
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,579
Why didn't you join them?

670
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:39,750
I just didn't.

671
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:43,795
You're dating Seong-seon, right?

672
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:45,213
Did you kiss her?

673
00:48:48,634 --> 00:48:49,885
We broke up.

674
00:48:57,643 --> 00:48:58,935
How does it feel to kiss?

675
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,277
I bet you're a delinquent.

676
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,446
Did you sleep with her?

677
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,371
I bet you'd never date
an ugly girl like me.

678
00:49:37,891 --> 00:49:38,975
Hey.

679
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,019
Why don't we break the ice with a kiss?

680
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:43,897
What?

681
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:53,699
Give me a cigarette. Let me try it.

682
00:49:57,953 --> 00:50:00,831
Don't. You're a nice kid.

683
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:03,625
What are you looking at

684
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:05,794
with that cute face?

685
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:09,715
Let's go. Break time is probably over.

686
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:14,052
I like you.

687
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:16,430
I'll be yours. Or you can be mine.

688
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,102
Yes, sure. Let's go, Eun-hui.

689
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,361
BAEKHWA REAL ESTATE

690
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:32,487
Oh, my gosh.

691
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,947
Are you serious?

692
00:50:34,030 --> 00:50:36,450
-Really?
-Yes, really.

693
00:50:37,033 --> 00:50:38,243
Like this.

694
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,790
You really did that? Like this?

695
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,711
You're unbelievable, Eun-hui.

696
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:48,962
I know.

697
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,214
Eun-hui, seriously.

698
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:57,345
You're so naughty! Was that it?

699
00:50:57,429 --> 00:51:00,599
-No, there's more.
-There's more? Then keep going.

700
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:03,852
-I'm telling her about my first love.
-I see.

701
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,771
-Keep going.
-Let me have a glass first.

702
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,022
Wait.

703
00:51:09,107 --> 00:51:10,066
Go on.

704
00:51:41,056 --> 00:51:42,849
Hey!

705
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,768
Don't say anything!

706
00:51:44,851 --> 00:51:45,936
KO MI-RAN

707
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:47,270
Mi-ran!

708
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,398
Ko Mi-ran! Stop!

709
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:55,529
GYM

710
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:03,870
Slow down.

711
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:06,790
I swear I'll kill you if you say anything!

712
00:52:06,873 --> 00:52:08,667
-Go!
-Pass!

713
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,710
Damn it. What are you doing?

714
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,712
-What do you want?
-Hey.

715
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:15,340
Did you really

716
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,175
kiss Eun-hui?

717
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,429
BANG HO-SIK
JUNG IN-GWON

718
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,640
Hey, did you hear that?

719
00:52:23,723 --> 00:52:24,891
YANG SEONG-SEON

720
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,059
Are you shocked?

721
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,481
You damn brat!

722
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,149
Tell me.

723
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,944
Did you really kiss Eun-hui?

724
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:38,989
Did you force her to kiss you
against her will? Like a man?

725
00:53:03,221 --> 00:53:04,139
Me?

726
00:53:08,435 --> 00:53:09,603
Kiss you?

727
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:12,564
By force?

728
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,734
Against your will?

729
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:18,987
Hey.

730
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:24,075
You liked it too.

731
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:45,347
-Eun-hui!
-Eun-hui!

732
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,848
-Hey!
-Call 911!

733
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,101
Call 911!

734
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,939
-"You liked it too."
-"You liked it too."

735
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:55,523
"You liked it too."

736
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:00,779
You guys are nuts.

737
00:54:03,156 --> 00:54:05,408
-"You liked it too."
-"You liked it too."

738
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:12,540
-"You liked it too."
-"You liked it too."

739
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:15,835
PUREUNG

740
00:55:14,394 --> 00:55:15,812
It's the sea!

741
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:18,273
It's the sea!

742
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:20,316
-Han-su is here!
-Han-su!

743
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:21,651
-Han-su!
-Han-su!

744
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:24,279
But back then, I used to laugh a lot
when I was with you guys.

745
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:28,825
Hey, Han-su! You're old now!

746
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,745
-Hey!
-Gosh, why are you guys always fighting?

747
00:55:31,828 --> 00:55:34,581
It's great to be back in Jeju.
I get to see my friends.

748
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,333
Pick whatever you want!

749
00:55:37,417 --> 00:55:39,586
-Dong-seok is here.
-Just eat.

750
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,546
-Excited?
-Me?

751
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:43,131
Your knife is all over the place.

752
00:55:43,214 --> 00:55:45,008
I'm scared to go near you.

753
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,343
I'll help you close up.

754
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:50,805
Do you have feelings for me?
Don't. You'll get hurt.

755
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,223
That's up to me to decide.

756
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:54,434
Me? You?

757
00:55:55,685 --> 00:55:57,604
Who told you to worry about money?

758
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,939
I'll find a way to pay for everything.

759
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:01,858
Are you getting a divorce?

760
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:06,029
Let's go to Mokpo.

761
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:10,742
