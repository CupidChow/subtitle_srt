Please be thorough with this part
so there won't be any condensation issues.

00:01:36,304 --> 00:01:37,347
Yes, ma'am.

15
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:40,725
When Mr. Oh comes today,

16
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,853
please tell him
to follow the floor plan for these stairs.

17
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:48,066
You do know that he once ignored
the floor plan while working,

18
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:50,777
and we had to pay more
for the re-construction, right?

19
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:53,488
-Really?
-Make sure that doesn't happen again.

20
00:01:54,614 --> 00:01:56,616
-I trust you.
-Okay, ma'am.

Dong-seok, my mom can't come this week.

25
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,051
She's going on a trip with her friend.

26
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,388
So I'm going to Jeju tomorrow morning.

27
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:20,140
See you then.

28
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,819
Hey, Tae-hun.

29
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,154
EUN-HUI

30
00:03:16,654 --> 00:03:19,157
Dong-seok, how is it going with your mom?

31
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:27,582
Yes?

32
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:30,126
I'm doing well.

33
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:33,296
Don't worry about me.

34
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:35,757
Is Dong-seok treating you well?

35
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,384
Yes.

36
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:41,221
Yes.

37
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,100
Does he call you "mom"?

38
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:50,271
No?

39
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,777
Still, your illness is a blessing.

40
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,905
Had you not been sick,
you wouldn't have been able

41
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,115
to go on a trip with him.

42
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,953
-Did you visit your hometown?
-We're on our way.

43
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:07,830
I'm going to take
the 3 p.m. ship back to Jeju.

44
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:12,293
Go visit your parents' graves with him.

45
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,670
Take your time.

46
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,798
I'll go over to your house
and heat the floor.

47
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,551
Stay with Man-su and Eun-gi
for three or four more days.

48
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:21,803
Don't be ridiculous.

49
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,180
I'm going back to see you.

50
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,941
Hop out. Let's go to the reservoir.

51
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,610
But I can't guarantee our safety.

52
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,656
Let's do everything you want to do.

53
00:04:43,032 --> 00:04:45,702
You can walk, right? I can't carry you.

54
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,789
Where was your house?

55
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:31,552
You don't know.

56
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:35,890
When was the last time you visited?

57
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:41,562
I visited once after having Dong-i.

58
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:48,027
Why didn't you visit
your hometown more often?

59
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,282
You must've had parents or siblings.

60
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,576
No.

61
00:08:56,827 --> 00:08:58,621
When did my grandparents pass away?

62
00:09:00,248 --> 00:09:01,958
When I was either six

63
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,876
or seven.

64
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,755
They died a year apart.

65
00:09:09,674 --> 00:09:10,758
Why?

66
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,221
I'm sure they were sick with something.

67
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,517
Unbelievable.

68
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,772
I remember seeing an aunt.

69
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,900
She visited Jeju when I was little.

70
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,988
Was she your sister or aunt?

71
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,909
She was short and pretty.

72
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:40,871
She passed away three years ago.

73
00:09:57,138 --> 00:09:58,431
Here?

74
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:01,976
She passed away at her son's place
in Happan Town.

75
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,318
Did you attend her funeral?

76
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,573
I later found out
that they had cremated her.

77
00:10:17,074 --> 00:10:19,493
Her kids never stayed in touch with me.

78
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:29,962
Why did you want to come here?

79
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,506
To visit your parents' graves?

80
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:37,053
And my older brother's grave.

81
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,306
You had a brother?

82
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:44,727
How old was he?

83
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,521
He must've been long gone.

84
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:49,857
Of course.

85
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,736
I was 13 or 14.

86
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:58,282
He was 19.

87
00:11:00,368 --> 00:11:03,913
He was bitten by a snake
while hanging out with his friends.

88
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:11,128
He was buried next to our parents.

89
00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:20,221
Are you done here then?

90
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,473
Yes.

91
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,503
Why are you limping?

92
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:00,928
Sit down.

93
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:03,973
Sit over there. Come on.

94
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,276
What's with your ankle?

95
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,361
It's nothing.

96
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,613
You always say that.

97
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:21,574
Let me see.

98
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,662
Look at your shoes.

99
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,624
Where do you spend all the money you make?

100
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:33,752
Jeez.

101
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:36,213
Does it hurt?

102
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,215
Since when?

103
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,719
-It'll get better soon.
-Don't be ridiculous!

104
00:12:41,802 --> 00:12:44,555
In that case, you could say
the same thing about your cancer.

105
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:46,515
Jeez.

106
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,060
Wait here.

107
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,874
Here. Use this and get up.

108
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:13,959
Okay.

109
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:22,218
Why did you insist on coming here?

110
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:25,429
There was nothing to see here but water.

111
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,232
Here. Hold on.

112
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,693
Throw that away.

113
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:41,654
Get on my back.

114
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:43,280
-I can walk.
-Just get on my back!

115
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,158
It's going to rain soon.
Don't be stubborn, jeez!

116
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,379
-Are you completely on my back?
-Yes.

117
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,185
You're all skin and bones now.

118
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,234
Jeez.

119
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:52,433
Why not look at your son
as lovingly as you look at that dog?

120
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,655
Did it even upset you when I was beaten

121
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,867
by Jong-u and Jong-cheol?

122
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:17,875
I heard that a mother's heart breaks
when their child gets hurt.

123
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,085
That's why…

124
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:23,464
I let them hit me
even when I could fend for myself.

125
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,549
I wanted you to suffer and feel the pain.

126
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,427
So how did you feel?

127
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,555
Were you heartbroken?

128
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,477
Or were you indifferent?

129
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,899
Did you want a man that badly?

130
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:47,488
Did you have to choose

131
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,616
that man over your own son?

132
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:56,956
What did I tell you
when you were worried about money?

133
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:00,250
I said I'd quit school

134
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:02,795
and go to the mainland
to make money at all costs.

135
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,674
That 15-year-old boy…

136
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,801
That little boy begged you.

137
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,431
When I became older,
I asked you to run away with me to Seoul.

138
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:21,313
Why are you so shameless and unapologetic?

139
00:16:22,731 --> 00:16:24,984
Do you have nothing to lose
now that you're dying?

140
00:16:29,905 --> 00:16:31,907
I had no one back then.

141
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,035
Both my dad and sister had passed away.

142
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:36,912
The only person I had…

143
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:43,794
was my mom.

144
00:16:49,633 --> 00:16:51,343
But you told me not to call you that.

145
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,180
That day,

146
00:16:56,098 --> 00:17:00,060
you took my mom,
the only person I had, away from me.

147
00:17:03,772 --> 00:17:06,775
So how could you brazenly say
that you're not sorry?

148
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,238
How could you?

149
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:14,450
How could you?

150
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:16,410
How could a crazy woman…

151
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:24,793
feel apologetic for anything?

152
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,929
Your mom is insane.

153
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,142
She must be crazy

154
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:44,313
because she made her daughter
harvest instead and got her killed.

155
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:48,233
All because she was too scared
to go into the sea.

156
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,323
Then she still wanted to live,
so she moved in with some man.

157
00:17:57,201 --> 00:17:58,535
She thought

158
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:03,040
making sure her son had
three meals a day was enough.

159
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,711
She thought living in a good house
and sending him to school was enough.

160
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:11,632
She was a fool. An idiot.

161
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:19,765
She just stared at her son
who was getting beaten up.

162
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:25,729
I deserve to die.

163
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,905
Don't bother to hold a funeral for me.

164
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:37,533
And don't mourn for me either.

165
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,204
Just…

166
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:45,165
throw me into the sea

167
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,043
where your sister

168
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,089
and dad lie…

169
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:42,973
Dong-seok, my mom can't come this week.

170
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:44,808
She's going on a trip with her friend.

171
00:19:45,434 --> 00:19:48,395
So I'm going to Jeju tomorrow morning.

172
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:49,771
See you then.

173
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:54,401
Where is Ms. Kang Ok-dong's guardian?

174
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,779
Come inside.

175
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:08,165
OFFICE 5

176
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,199
The doctor asked

177
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,369
if I really was your son.

178
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:48,622
He couldn't understand

179
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:52,167
how I dragged you
everywhere but the hospital

180
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:54,711
in your dire state.

181
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:57,130
He said I was insane.

182
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:01,260
He got pretty upset with me.

183
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,264
You need to be hospitalized right now.

184
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:08,016
If not, you'll die.

185
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:16,858
Let's go.

186
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:21,947
Let's go back to Jeju.

187
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,741
Something could happen to you
on our way back.

188
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,620
Stay here. I'll book a hospital room.

189
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:32,040
I don't care. Let's just go home.

190
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,713
Come on.

191
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,391
Nurse.

192
00:21:50,684 --> 00:21:52,352
Please take out her IV drip.

193
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,062
She needs to be hospitalized…

194
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:55,981
We're not doing that,
so please take it out.

195
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,108
-You can't do that.
-Why can't I?

196
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,152
She's my mom. I'm escorting her.

197
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,737
Hurry up. We need to go home.

198
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:14,624
We'll be boarding in two hours.
We should eat something.

199
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:17,252
What do you want? Rice with soup?

200
00:22:18,211 --> 00:22:20,255
Doenjang stew, your favorite.

201
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:23,633
I told you I don't eat that anymore.

202
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:26,386
Then jajangmyeon.

203
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:32,059
Come out.

204
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:19,272
TRADITIONAL CHINESE CUISINE
HYANGJAGAK

205
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:38,792
Enjoy.

206
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:06,695
Excuse me. Can we get a pair of scissors?

207
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,612
Okay.

208
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,323
-Give table three a pair of scissors.
-Yes, sir.

209
00:24:25,213 --> 00:24:26,464
Use a spoon.

210
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,400
Since when did you like jajangmyeon?

211
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,153
I don't ever remember seeing you eat it.

212
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,823
I know Dong-i and I
used to have it on market days.

213
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,120
I had it every now and then
when your dad was still alive.

214
00:25:03,084 --> 00:25:04,377
Did he treat you well?

215
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,637
Did he adore you?

216
00:25:22,395 --> 00:25:23,813
What did he do?

217
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,067
Did he pat you on your head
and show you affection?

218
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,779
No, he bought me jajangmyeon.

219
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,573
That's not showing affection.

220
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,075
If it was tangsuyuk, maybe.

221
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:56,846
Let me know if there's anything else
you want to do. I'll do it.

222
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:00,892
-Let's go to Gusa Town.
-Gusa Town?

223
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,770
Where is that? Is it nearby?

224
00:26:05,772 --> 00:26:07,565
Then no, we'll miss our ship.

225
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,109
I need to meet someone in Jeju.

226
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:26,626
Dong-seok, Yeol got injured.

227
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,672
It's not that serious.
You don't need to worry.

228
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,717
But I don't think
I can go to Jeju tomorrow.

229
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,218
I need to be with him.

230
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:39,097
I'm sorry. I'll text you again later.

231
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,648
Let's go to Gusa Town.
I'll change our ride to the last ship.

232
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,745
GUSA RESTAURANT

233
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:24,142
This is where you met Dad
when he wasn't at sea?

234
00:27:27,687 --> 00:27:29,356
What were you doing here?

235
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,781
I cooked rice

236
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:41,284
and washed the dishes.

237
00:27:46,414 --> 00:27:47,832
Since how young?

238
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:52,545
Either 13 or 14.

239
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:57,675
You had it tough growing up.

240
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,058
Should we go to Jeju tomorrow?

241
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,644
Let's just go today.

242
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,563
Do you want to visit Aunt's kids?

243
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:11,856
Do you know their address?

244
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:14,150
Let's just go.

245
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,947
Do her kids not welcome you?

246
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,451
They're too caught up in life.

247
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:25,745
Let them be.

248
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:47,851
-Drink some of this.
-Okay.

249
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:09,247
Yeong-ju gave birth to a girl.

250
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,249
She's 3.3kg and healthy.

251
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:17,255
Here.

252
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:19,299
Eun-hui sent it.

253
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,719
Goodness, look how small she is.

254
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,097
She takes after both Hyeon
and Yeong-ju, doesn't she?

255
00:29:26,681 --> 00:29:28,308
How pretty.

256
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:38,193
Get some sleep.

257
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:48,119
How do you write "gyeong"?

258
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,718
GYEONG

259
00:30:08,723 --> 00:30:10,517
OH

260
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:16,272
OH MAN-GYEONG

261
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,024
Who is Oh Man-gyeong?

262
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,403
My mom.

263
00:30:27,575 --> 00:30:28,660
My grandma?

264
00:30:39,295 --> 00:30:40,463
What else?

265
00:30:40,547 --> 00:30:41,798
I'll write it down.

266
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,468
What was your dad's name?

267
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:50,056
Kang Pal-pan.

268
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,149
Kang Pal-pan.

269
00:31:00,984 --> 00:31:02,110
And…

270
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:08,408
This is Lee Cheon-so.

271
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:09,450
Your husband.

272
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:13,830
And this is me.

273
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:16,457
Lee Dong-seok.

274
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,005
And this is Lee Dong-i.

275
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,215
LEE DONG-I

276
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:31,848
And this is Kang Ok-dong.

277
00:31:32,765 --> 00:31:34,142
Your name.

278
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,769
KANG OK-DONG

279
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:37,896
What else?

280
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:39,898
What else do you want to know?

281
00:31:41,941 --> 00:31:43,026
Jeju.

282
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:56,956
-What else?
-Mokpo.

283
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:06,549
Sea.

284
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,058
Pureung.

285
00:32:21,481 --> 00:32:22,649
Eolruki.

286
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:30,615
Kkamangi.

287
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,876
Mount Halla.

288
00:32:45,171 --> 00:32:46,297
Have you been there?

289
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:50,343
How could you call yourself a Jeju native?

290
00:32:50,927 --> 00:32:52,178
Have you been?

291
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,681
Of course. I went every time I got upset.

292
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:56,891
Whenever I hated you

293
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,853
and got mad,
I went to Baengnokdam Lake many times.

294
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:06,526
How can you call yourself a Jeju native
if you've never been to Mount Halla?

295
00:33:19,497 --> 00:33:20,999
Do you want to go to Mount Halla?

296
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,877
Of course I do.

297
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,088
But you can't since you're sick.

298
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:34,971
Baengnokdam Lake is truly magnificent
when it's covered in snow.

299
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:38,474
It's the most gorgeous sight ever.

300
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,269
How was your trip?

301
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,189
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

302
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:28,775
Hey, where's your mom?

303
00:34:30,151 --> 00:34:30,985
She's asleep.

304
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:34,197
Did she enjoy her trip to Mokpo?

305
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,782
How is she feeling?

306
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:37,366
Go. Bye.

307
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:41,120
I left some seolleongtang
at your mom's place.

308
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,414
Dong-seok, did you get that?

309
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:46,000
Take it out of the fridge
and give some to your mom!

310
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,336
Ms. Hyeon heated the floor too!

311
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,797
Hey! Dong-seok, can you hear me?

312
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,964
Eun-hui.

313
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,300
Just call him.

314
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,885
Right.

315
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:58,513
I can just give him a call. Jeez.

316
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:02,058
I really am a fool at times.

317
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:04,727
Where's my phone?

318
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,399
Hey.

319
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:13,820
Eun-hui, have you called
Han-su and Mi-ran yet?

320
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,905
Do they know about the athletic meet?

321
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,324
They don't have time for that.

322
00:35:18,407 --> 00:35:20,785
They can't come all the way here.
Are you insane?

323
00:35:20,868 --> 00:35:24,831
Call them, okay?
We need to beat Osan-ri this time around!

324
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:25,873
Beat them yourself.

325
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:29,293
Hey! We can't afford to lose again!

326
00:35:30,086 --> 00:35:31,170
Damn it.

327
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:35,318
We're halfway up Mount Halla.

328
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:37,862
Is it snowing?

329
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:40,531
No, it snowed a few days ago.

330
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,618
The wind is just blowing that snow.

331
00:36:50,249 --> 00:36:52,293
You probably came here
before though, right?

332
00:37:00,968 --> 00:37:05,097
Baengnokdam Lake looks
more marvelous than this, right?

333
00:37:05,181 --> 00:37:06,474
Of course.

334
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:08,309
It's incomparable.

335
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:12,188
Baengnokdam Lake covered in snow
is the best sight in the world.

336
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,652
Take me there.

337
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:24,492
It takes four to five hours
just to get there.

338
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,913
You won't be able to come back down
midway even if you wanted to.

339
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,456
Just enjoy this view.

340
00:37:35,378 --> 00:37:37,922
-Do you really want to go?
-Yes.

341
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,227
Fine, let's go.

342
00:37:51,852 --> 00:37:53,813
Let's do everything
you can before you die.

343
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,525
Wait here.

344
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,380
Wear this.

345
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:21,757
-You should sell this.
-Just wear it.

346
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,218
Here.

347
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:52,121
All right. Stay here.
I'll buy some hot tea.

348
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,239
Thanks.

349
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,789
Here.

350
00:40:22,211 --> 00:40:24,296
We merely walked for 30 minutes.

351
00:40:25,005 --> 00:40:26,590
We still have a long way to go.

352
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,219
Let's just go back. It's too tiring.

353
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,035
Let's say

354
00:40:56,495 --> 00:40:59,081
you had the choice to reincarnate.

355
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,250
Then would you?

356
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:06,714
No?

357
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:10,759
Are you sick of living?

358
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,808
It'd be nice to reincarnate.

359
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,227
As what?

360
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:23,564
A bird?

361
00:41:24,773 --> 00:41:25,858
A flower?

362
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:29,528
Wind? Or a man?

363
00:41:32,865 --> 00:41:35,743
I'd like to be born into a wealthy family.

364
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,040
Then I wouldn't have to worry about money

365
00:41:42,291 --> 00:41:44,043
and I'd be able to read and write.

366
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,631
My kids wouldn't have to work.

367
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:50,883
They'd be able to study more.

368
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:54,470
Unlike my late husband

369
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:58,182
who met an untimely death,

370
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:02,686
I'd like to meet someone
who would live a long life.

371
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:06,607
I'd love to live like that if I could.

372
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:09,193
Or not.

373
00:42:15,866 --> 00:42:17,868
If you reincarnate,

374
00:42:19,537 --> 00:42:21,664
would you want to be my mom again?

375
00:42:24,959 --> 00:42:26,168
Why not?

376
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,422
-Because I have a terrible temper?
-Yes.

377
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,635
I don't want to be your son either.

378
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,348
Why would I want to live
with a coldhearted mom again?

379
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,438
Sit down. Over there.

380
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,326
Jeez.

381
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,892
What if

382
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,395
I was kind and softhearted?

383
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,149
What if I didn't get into fights,

384
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:34,486
studied well, was obedient,

385
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:37,489
laughed a lot, and was friendly
like Dong-i was?

386
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,826
Then would you have me again?

387
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,890
Dong-i…

388
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,018
liked the sea.

389
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:12,608
She didn't go in there
because you told her to.

390
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:15,277
It was her own free will.

391
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,281
You told her not to do it.

392
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,201
You said you could harvest alone.

393
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,581
You dissuaded her. I remember that.

394
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:41,387
What was your happiest memory?

395
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,141
Right now.

396
00:44:47,226 --> 00:44:48,644
When you have cancer?

397
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:51,897
I love this trip

398
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,527
we're taking to Mount Halla right now.

399
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,579
Jeez. I'm speechless.

400
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:11,333
Your happiest memory is taking a trip

401
00:45:12,668 --> 00:45:14,837
with your coldhearted son to Mount Halla

402
00:45:17,005 --> 00:45:18,632
as a Jeju native yourself.

403
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,510
Let's go.

404
00:45:22,094 --> 00:45:23,470
My legs are so sore.

405
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,432
We're almost at the foot.

406
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:28,267
-Let's just go home.
-I'm so tired.

407
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,521
Let's go back. We can't go any farther.

408
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:37,901
Okay? They also gave up
and are going home.

409
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,111
So let's go.

410
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,575
Let's go to Baengnokdam Lake.

411
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:47,327
We can't. We've come far enough already.

412
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,495
Let's just go.

413
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,373
No. Let's go.

414
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:53,000
Don't be ridiculous.

415
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:55,961
Your lips are dry and cracked,
and you're looking pale.

416
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:59,715
I'm going to see Baengnokdam Lake
covered in snow myself.

417
00:46:00,883 --> 00:46:02,009
Unbelievable.

418
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,140
Excuse me.

419
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:11,768
Could you take my mother with you?

420
00:46:11,852 --> 00:46:12,853
Sure.

421
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:21,069
I'll go to the peak and take a photo
of Baengnokdam Lake covered in snow.

422
00:46:21,153 --> 00:46:22,905
Let me go alone.

423
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:27,618
You descend with them,
take a cab, and go home.

424
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:31,538
If you don't want to do that,
wait for me at the cafe down there, okay?

425
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,290
All right? Hold on.

426
00:46:39,671 --> 00:46:42,716
I'll be back soon.
I'll go up there and descend quickly.

427
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,513
-Thank you in advance!
-No problem!

428
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,016
Come with us, ma'am.

429
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:55,020
Ma'am, let us escort you
down the mountain!

430
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,702
Enjoy.

431
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,285
JONG-U

432
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,927
AUNT

433
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:05,020
Hello.

434
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:49,082
There's too much snow,
so I'm not allowed to go any farther.

435
00:52:50,041 --> 00:52:51,543
I can't reach Baengnokdam Lake.

436
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:55,422
Baengnokdam Lake is over there.

437
00:52:56,172 --> 00:52:57,299
There.

438
00:52:59,426 --> 00:53:00,719
Up there,

439
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,056
there are all kinds of deer.

440
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,310
They drink water up there.

441
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,149
Can you see it?

442
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:21,281
Later…

443
00:53:40,508 --> 00:53:41,676
Later…

444
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:47,390
Let's come back here next spring.

445
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:57,817
Just you and me, Mom.

446
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,070
I'll bring you here.

447
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:02,113
I promise.

448
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:16,169
There's too much snow,
so I'm not allowed to go any farther.

449
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:18,630
I can't reach Baengnokdam Lake.

450
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,840
Baengnokdam Lake--

451
00:55:03,216 --> 00:55:04,092
Hello.

452
00:55:11,307 --> 00:55:12,392
Let's go.

453
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,270
Let's go.

454
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:19,149
-How much was this?
-Six thousand won.

455
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:25,155
There's too much snow,
so I'm not allowed to go any farther.

456
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,407
I can't reach Baengnokdam Lake.

457
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:31,286
Baengnokdam Lake is over there.

458
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:32,787
There.

459
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:34,706
Up there,

460
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,835
there are all kinds of deer.

461
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,088
They drink water up there.

462
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:43,840
Can you see it?

463
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,301
Later…

464
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,597
Let's come back here next spring.

465
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:53,975
Just you and me, Mom.

466
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,311
I'll bring you here.

467
00:55:57,228 --> 00:55:58,354
I promise.

468
00:56:02,192 --> 00:56:05,695
If you want to watch it again,
press the arrow button.

469
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:10,700
There's too much snow,
so I'm not allowed to go any farther.

470
00:56:11,576 --> 00:56:13,203
I can't reach Baengnokdam Lake.

471
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:17,082
Baengnokdam Lake is over there.

472
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,917
There.

473
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:22,295
Up there,

474
00:56:23,463 --> 00:56:26,633
there are all kinds of deer.

475
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,427
They drink water up there.

476
00:56:35,642 --> 00:56:36,893
Can you see it?

477
00:57:08,049 --> 00:57:10,009
Ms. Hyeon must've turned the lights on.

478
00:57:20,728 --> 00:57:22,689
Do you want to see…

479
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,192
What?

480
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:30,613
Do you want to see my house?

481
00:57:32,490 --> 00:57:34,284
Just go to bed if you're too tired.

482
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:39,873
Do you want to see?

483
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:43,001
Let's go.

484
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:15,742
Dong-seok.

485
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,245
This is my mom.

486
00:58:23,750 --> 00:58:24,876
I like her.

487
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:29,547
Hello.

488
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:40,183
Mom, who are they?

489
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:46,147
Yeol insisted on seeing horses,
so I had to bring him.

490
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,317
I used to be

491
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,072
a neighborhood friend of hers
from way back.

492
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,115
Who are you?

493
00:59:01,496 --> 00:59:03,414
Yeol, say hello.

494
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,333
Go to him and say hello.

495
00:59:05,875 --> 00:59:06,751
Good boy.

496
00:59:18,179 --> 00:59:19,389
You know what?

497
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:21,891
I'm really good at riding horses.

498
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:27,939
Do you want to go with me tomorrow?

499
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,164
I heard

500
00:59:46,291 --> 00:59:47,750
that you're not feeling well.

501
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,838
How are you now?

502
00:59:53,965 --> 00:59:55,300
Dong-seok…

503
00:59:56,384 --> 00:59:59,554
has a very kind heart.

504
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:06,436
I know.

505
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:18,823
He has a very kind heart indeed.

506
01:00:26,039 --> 01:00:28,291
Dong-seok, drive me back home.

507
01:00:34,547 --> 01:00:36,090
It's warm here.

508
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,844
How about you spend the night here?

509
01:01:16,172 --> 01:01:17,548
Good night. I'll leave now.

510
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:44,242
I'm sure they went to a good place.

511
01:01:45,910 --> 01:01:47,245
How do you know?

512
01:01:48,079 --> 01:01:49,622
It's obvious

513
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,251
since we've never seen them in our dreams.

514
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,471
Both your dad and Dong-i.

515
01:02:08,266 --> 01:02:10,017
And also Chun-hui's children.

516
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:13,646
Man-deok, Man-yeong,

517
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:18,234
and Man-gil.
None of them appeared in our dreams.

518
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:25,283
That means they're happy where they are.

519
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,500
Should I sleep here?

520
01:02:36,043 --> 01:02:38,588
And leave the woman
and her kid behind? Just go.

521
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,257
Aren't you scared?

522
01:02:41,340 --> 01:02:43,009
No, I'm not.

523
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,553
What is there to be scared of?

524
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,222
I'll be reunited with Dong-i once again.

525
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:52,602
What are you talking about?
I was asking about sleeping alone.

526
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:03,613
Make some doenjang stew
for breakfast tomorrow. I'll come by.

527
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,700
I thought you didn't like

528
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,244
doenjang stew.

529
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:13,623
Yours is tasty.

530
01:03:15,291 --> 01:03:17,043
I don't like other people's.

531
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,547
Good night.

532
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:37,146
-Leave it open.
-You'll catch a cold.

533
01:05:19,624 --> 01:05:22,543
Come here.

534
01:05:23,169 --> 01:05:24,128
Come and eat.

535
01:05:32,803 --> 01:05:34,013
Eat up.

536
01:05:34,096 --> 01:05:36,474
Here you go.

537
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:43,481
Good boys.

538
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,364
Here. Eat up.

539
01:05:53,199 --> 01:05:54,408
Is it tasty?

540
01:06:00,706 --> 01:06:02,792
You're eating so well.

541
01:06:29,235 --> 01:06:30,444
I'm here.

542
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,424
Goodness.

543
01:07:04,645 --> 01:07:05,980
It's delicious.

544
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:09,066
Are you still asleep?

545
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:11,235
I'm here. Get up.

546
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:15,031
Let's go see some horses
with Seon-a and her son.

547
01:07:30,087 --> 01:07:31,213
Mom.

548
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,230
Ms. Hyeon.

549
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:33,275
Ms. Hyeon, it's me. Dong-seok.

550
01:08:40,324 --> 01:08:41,408
Okay.

551
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:45,746
I'll call Jeong-jun and Eun-hui myself.

552
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:48,207
Just stay by her side.

553
01:09:09,353 --> 01:09:10,604
Okay.

554
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:14,859
I'll be there with Yeol

555
01:09:16,026 --> 01:09:17,278
once he wakes up.

556
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:21,657
Okay.

557
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,796
Mom…

558
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,806
Mom…

559
01:12:38,562 --> 01:12:40,814
Mom…

560
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:43,942
She never said she loved me

561
01:12:44,485 --> 01:12:46,153
or that she was sorry.

562
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:49,656
My mom, Kang Ok-dong…

563
01:12:51,658 --> 01:12:54,787
made a bowl of my favorite food,
doenjang stew.

564
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:59,041
Then she returned to where she used to be.

565
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:01,752
Mom…

566
01:13:02,586 --> 01:13:04,797
I hugged my dead mom's body and cried.

567
01:13:06,507 --> 01:13:08,133
That's when I realized something.

568
01:13:10,928 --> 01:13:12,137
I had never

569
01:13:14,014 --> 01:13:16,683
resented her in my entire life.

570
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:18,185
Mom…

571
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:21,230
I just wanted to embrace
and reconcile with her.

572
01:13:23,482 --> 01:13:24,525
I just wanted

573
01:13:25,776 --> 01:13:28,779
to hug her for a very long time

574
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,076
and cry as much as I wanted.

575
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:31,300
PUREUNG BUS STOP

576
01:14:42,978 --> 01:14:45,606
CONGRATULATIONS
GRADUATION

577
01:14:55,824 --> 01:14:59,495
1 MONTH LATER

578
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:17,930
23RD PUREUNG-RI VS OSAN-RI
UNITY ATHLETIC MEET

579
01:15:22,935 --> 01:15:25,812
23RD PUREUNG-RI VS OSAN-RI
UNITY ATHLETIC MEET

580
01:15:25,896 --> 01:15:28,857
One, two.

581
01:15:28,941 --> 01:15:31,401
One, two.

582
01:15:31,485 --> 01:15:33,278
One, two.

583
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:34,530
When are we starting?

584
01:15:34,613 --> 01:15:36,490
We're going to spend all day here.

585
01:15:37,324 --> 01:15:39,243
Do you want to lose to Osan-ri again?

586
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:42,162
We lost two years in a row.

587
01:15:42,246 --> 01:15:45,541
Do you want them to win
and humiliate us again? We must win.

588
01:15:48,001 --> 01:15:50,420
-Let's go.
-Ready, set, go.

589
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:55,008
-One…
-One, two.

590
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:56,969
Come and eat!

591
01:16:01,098 --> 01:16:02,432
Come and eat!

592
01:16:03,016 --> 01:16:05,060
Stop coming!

593
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:08,355
We need to practice for the athletic meet.
Don't make them come.

594
01:16:12,150 --> 01:16:16,196
Why did you make so much?
When will we sell all of this?

595
01:16:16,280 --> 01:16:17,531
-You made it!
-You made it!

596
01:16:18,824 --> 01:16:20,450
-Did I?
-Ice!

597
01:16:20,534 --> 01:16:21,743
Make way for ice!

598
01:16:21,827 --> 01:16:23,704
Hey, don't tire yourself out!

599
01:16:23,787 --> 01:16:25,831
-Ice is here!
-Come and eat!

600
01:16:25,914 --> 01:16:27,499
-It's 3 chub mackerels for 10,000 won.
-Take a look.

601
01:16:27,583 --> 01:16:28,792
Take a look at the hairtails, ma'am.

602
01:16:28,875 --> 01:16:31,128
-We have fresh hairtail caught today!
-The Spanish mackerels are fresh.

603
01:16:31,211 --> 01:16:32,921
We have John Dory and tilefish.

604
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:35,132
All right. Hold on.

605
01:16:35,215 --> 01:16:38,385
Here you go. I'll get it ready in a jiffy.

606
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,886
-Here you go.
-How much?

607
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:41,722
-Twenty thousand's worth.
-All right.

608
01:16:42,347 --> 01:16:45,517
Come and check out the vegetables.

609
01:16:46,393 --> 01:16:47,519
What?

610
01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,493
-Come and check out the vegetables.
-How much for all of these?

611
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:04,661
What?

612
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:09,416
-Goodness! My dear Mi-ran!
-Goodness! My dear mom!

613
01:17:11,793 --> 01:17:13,962
Come here. Goodness.

614
01:17:15,339 --> 01:17:17,049
Mom!

615
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:18,300
Goodness.

616
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:20,886
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

617
01:17:22,512 --> 01:17:26,558
Pick whatever you want!

618
01:17:29,561 --> 01:17:33,273
Pick whatever you want!
It's a blowout sale!

619
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:38,153
-"Pick whatever you want. A blowout sale."
-Pick whatever you want. A blowout sale.

620
01:17:38,236 --> 01:17:40,030
-It's a blowout…
-"It's a blowout sale."

621
01:17:40,113 --> 01:17:41,698
ALL ITEMS ON SALE

622
01:17:42,282 --> 01:17:44,201
Jeez. Why are you here?

623
01:17:44,284 --> 01:17:46,870
You already came to Jeju
this month for my mom's funeral.

624
01:17:46,953 --> 01:17:49,373
Look at you. You must be wealthy.

625
01:17:49,873 --> 01:17:51,792
The new bank kept you quite busy.

626
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:53,960
In-gwon, Ho-sik, Myeong-bo,

627
01:17:54,044 --> 01:17:57,214
Eun-hui, and Mi-ran insisted that I come.

628
01:17:58,632 --> 01:18:00,425
And I wanted to come too.

629
01:18:02,302 --> 01:18:04,471
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

630
01:18:05,347 --> 01:18:06,556
We must move on.

631
01:18:09,059 --> 01:18:11,728
23RD PUREUNG-RI VS OSAN-RI
UNITY ATHLETIC MEET

632
01:18:11,812 --> 01:18:13,105
Let's do it!

633
01:18:13,188 --> 01:18:15,273
-Let's go!
-You can do it!

634
01:18:15,357 --> 01:18:17,484
-Eun-hui and Mi-ran, let's go!
-Let's go!

635
01:18:17,567 --> 01:18:18,694
-Okay?
-Okay.

636
01:18:19,277 --> 01:18:20,987
Let's go!

637
01:18:21,071 --> 01:18:23,573
-One, two!
-One, two!

638
01:18:23,657 --> 01:18:26,326
-Hurry!
-Mi-ran!

639
01:18:26,410 --> 01:18:27,452
One, two!

640
01:18:28,078 --> 01:18:30,247
-One, two!
-One, two!

641
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:33,125
-One, two!
-One, two!

642
01:18:33,208 --> 01:18:34,376
Come on!

643
01:18:34,459 --> 01:18:35,627
-Burst it!
-Burst it!

644
01:18:37,879 --> 01:18:39,339
-One, two.
-Wait!

645
01:18:39,423 --> 01:18:40,298
-One, two.
-Hurry!

646
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,093
One, two.

647
01:18:43,176 --> 01:18:44,886
-I'm so exhausted.
-Me too.

648
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:47,973
-Jeez.
-Gosh.

649
01:18:48,974 --> 01:18:49,891
Look at that.

650
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:52,060
-One, two.
-Han-su is still handsome.

651
01:18:52,144 --> 01:18:54,312
We're almost there!

652
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:55,605
Getting butterflies?

653
01:18:57,482 --> 01:18:59,484
Hey, whenever you feel that way,

654
01:19:00,068 --> 01:19:04,406
just tell yourself,
"He's already taken. I can't have him."

655
01:19:06,950 --> 01:19:08,702
"He's already taken."

656
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,246
"I can't have him."

657
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:12,414
That's it.

658
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:16,960
You did it!

659
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:23,925
-One, two.
-One, two.

660
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,554
LET'S GO, HAENYEO YEONG-OK!

661
01:19:28,764 --> 01:19:31,558
Go!

662
01:19:31,641 --> 01:19:33,185
That's it!

663
01:19:35,103 --> 01:19:39,191
-One, two!
-One, two!

664
01:19:39,274 --> 01:19:41,651
PUREUNG GRANDPAS
YOUR GRANDCHILD IS WATCHING!

665
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:47,532
-One, two!
-One, two!

666
01:19:50,118 --> 01:19:51,036
Darn it!

667
01:19:51,119 --> 01:19:52,454
Go, quickly!

668
01:19:52,537 --> 01:19:56,666
-One, two!
-One, two!

669
01:19:57,250 --> 01:19:58,543
Grandma!

670
01:19:58,627 --> 01:20:00,587
-You can do it!
-Faster!

671
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:02,547
You can do it!

672
01:20:03,757 --> 01:20:06,301
One, two.

673
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:07,385
Go!

674
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:09,513
You're doing well!

675
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:12,682
Yes!

676
01:20:12,766 --> 01:20:15,727
-One, two!
-One, two!

677
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,196
-Yes!
-Yes!

678
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:43,964
Let's go, Pureung!

679
01:20:44,047 --> 01:20:45,423
Yes!

680
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,592
-Eun-gi.
-Dong-seok!

681
01:20:57,185 --> 01:20:58,270
Hey.

682
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:02,148
Are you sure she likes you back?

683
01:21:06,278 --> 01:21:08,280
-Come on.
-What?

684
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:09,990
I'll introduce her to you later.

685
01:21:10,782 --> 01:21:12,534
Just do it right now.

686
01:21:12,617 --> 01:21:15,078
Jeez. Come on. Get ready.

687
01:21:15,161 --> 01:21:15,996
-Dong-seok?
-Yeong-ok.

688
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:17,831
-Yes?
-Give her a uniform too.

689
01:21:17,914 --> 01:21:18,874
-Okay.
-Hurry up.

690
01:21:19,791 --> 01:21:22,127
Come on. Get ready for the next game.

691
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,587
Look at you!

692
01:21:23,670 --> 01:21:26,715
-Come on.
-Look at you!

693
01:21:27,966 --> 01:21:29,217
Change into this.

694
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:33,305
My name is Yeong-ok. And you?

695
01:21:34,973 --> 01:21:37,350
I'm Seon-a. Min Seon-a.

696
01:21:38,018 --> 01:21:39,144
You're pretty.

697
01:21:39,227 --> 01:21:41,146
Yeong-hui, take good care of her, okay?

698
01:21:43,940 --> 01:21:45,191
Let's win.

699
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:48,987
-Let's win.
-Let's win.

700
01:21:50,864 --> 01:21:53,199
-Go!
-Byeol-i!

701
01:22:01,166 --> 01:22:05,712
-Lee Yeong-ok!
-Lee Yeong-ok!

702
01:22:05,795 --> 01:22:07,797
-That hurts.
-You can do it.

703
01:22:07,881 --> 01:22:09,883
-Yeong-ok, let's go!
-Yeong-ok, let's go!

704
01:22:09,966 --> 01:22:10,926
Use your head!

705
01:22:11,009 --> 01:22:12,427
-Lee Yeong-ok!
-Lee Yeong-ok!

706
01:22:12,510 --> 01:22:16,723
-You can do it!
-Lee Yeong-ok!

707
01:22:16,806 --> 01:22:19,142
-Lee Yeong-ok!
-Lee Yeong-ok!

708
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:21,937
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

709
01:22:25,607 --> 01:22:27,067
Push her!

710
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:35,200
I told you to use your head!

711
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,369
I did use my head!

712
01:22:38,078 --> 01:22:39,537
Darn it.

713
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,122
Stop it!

714
01:22:41,206 --> 01:22:42,832
-Hold on.
-It's okay.

715
01:22:42,916 --> 01:22:45,001
Pull her like this!

716
01:22:45,085 --> 01:22:47,712
-Lee Yeong-ok!
-Lee Yeong-ok!

717
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,172
-Lee Yeong-ok!
-Lee Yeong-ok!

718
01:22:49,255 --> 01:22:50,799
Let's go!

719
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:53,468
-Her leg!
-That's it!

720
01:22:53,551 --> 01:22:54,636
Pull it!

721
01:22:54,719 --> 01:22:57,138
Pull her leg!

722
01:22:57,222 --> 01:22:58,264
She can do it.

723
01:22:59,683 --> 01:23:01,393
-Oh, dear.
-Throw her!

724
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:17,492
-Park Hye-ja.
-Park Hye-ja.

725
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:23,540
MOVE ASIDE FOR OSAN-RI!

726
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:32,507
You can do it!

727
01:23:33,883 --> 01:23:34,968
Go, Eun-hui!

728
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:41,433
You can do it!

729
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:43,393
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

730
01:23:43,476 --> 01:23:44,978
You can do it, Eun-hui!

731
01:23:45,061 --> 01:23:46,855
-You can do it!
-Go get her!

732
01:23:46,938 --> 01:23:49,482
-Let's go!
-You can do it!

733
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:52,277
You can do it!

734
01:23:52,360 --> 01:23:53,903
VICTORY IS OURS!

735
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:07,125
I did it!

736
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,335
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

737
01:24:09,919 --> 01:24:12,213
-I'll mark Sim-bok.
-I'll mark Chang-jun.

738
01:24:12,297 --> 01:24:13,965
-I'll mark Son-man.
-I'll…

739
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:15,925
I'll just run around.

740
01:24:16,009 --> 01:24:18,261
-I'll mark Hyang-suk.
-I'll mark anyone.

741
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,346
Me too.

742
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,265
Unity between Osan and Pureung?

743
01:24:22,348 --> 01:24:25,393
Unity, my foot. It's all about winning.
We must win at all costs!

744
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:28,021
-Exactly. Let's kill them all!
-Kill them all!

745
01:24:28,104 --> 01:24:29,939
Let's go. One, two, three.

746
01:24:30,023 --> 01:24:31,357
-Kill them!
-Kill them!

747
01:24:31,441 --> 01:24:33,485
-Pureung, let's go!
-Pureung, let's go!

748
01:24:57,759 --> 01:24:58,802
Let's go!

749
01:26:13,042 --> 01:26:15,420
You…

750
01:26:18,548 --> 01:26:19,632
"Abandoned me."

751
01:26:20,592 --> 01:26:21,801
Abandoned me!

752
01:26:22,552 --> 01:26:23,636
"On the subway."

753
01:26:24,679 --> 01:26:25,847
On the subway!

754
01:27:15,104 --> 01:27:16,731
Suit yourself.

755
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:20,568
You refuse to listen to me
despite being all grown up.

756
01:27:20,652 --> 01:27:24,030
Your mom and dad aren't coming.

757
01:27:24,113 --> 01:27:26,407
No, that's not true!

758
01:27:48,846 --> 01:27:49,973
Later…

759
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:53,601
Let's come back here next spring.

760
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,195
Can you see it?

761
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,452
Later…

762
01:28:30,555 --> 01:28:31,806
Later…

763
01:28:34,976 --> 01:28:37,520
Let's come back here next spring.

764
01:28:44,861 --> 01:28:47,864
Just you and me, Mom.

765
01:28:48,823 --> 01:28:50,116
I'll bring you here.

766
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,285
I promise.

767
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:10,094
I'm smiling.

768
01:29:11,512 --> 01:29:14,057
-Hey!
-Hey! Go get them!

769
01:29:14,140 --> 01:29:15,725
Let's welcome him, everyone.

770
01:29:16,434 --> 01:29:18,811
-Hey!
-Get them!

771
01:29:18,895 --> 01:29:19,979
Come on.

772
01:30:02,897 --> 01:30:05,358
THERE IS ONE THING
WE MUST REMEMBER IN OUR LIFETIME

773
01:30:05,441 --> 01:30:08,152
WE WEREN'T BORN INTO THIS WORLD
TO SUFFER OR FEEL MISERABLE

774
01:30:08,236 --> 01:30:10,822
WE WERE BORN TO BE HAPPY
WE WISH EVERYONE HAPPINESS!

775
01:31:29,150 --> 01:31:34,155
