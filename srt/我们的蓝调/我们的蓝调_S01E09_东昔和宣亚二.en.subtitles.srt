1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,862
DONG-SEOK AND SEON-A

2
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,613
PAST WOUNDS ON AN UNEXPECTED ROAD,
YOUR WARMTH IN AN ARCADE ON A RAINY DAY

3
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:31,591
ABANG SUNDAE

4
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:54,197
What do you want?

5
00:01:58,243 --> 00:01:59,911
Don't start with me.

6
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:04,541
I already had a big fight with Hyeon.

7
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,962
I'm too exhausted to fight with you.

8
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,258
Just go.

9
00:02:27,313 --> 00:02:29,190
Are you kidding me?

10
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:31,985
Get out.

11
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,740
Do you have a damn death wish?

12
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,453
GREAT KING

13
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:42,931
Sit comfortably.

14
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:58,821
Drink up.

15
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,258
Let's let the kids…

16
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,263
have the baby.

17
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,477
The two of us

18
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:31,980
may have to live

19
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:37,694
the rest of our lives as pathetic losers.

20
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:39,946
But I don't want…

21
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:44,117
other people pointing fingers
at our kids--

22
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,370
Who the hell dared to point
their fingers at our kids? Damn it.

23
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:50,707
We're their fathers.

24
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,209
We worked like dogs to raise them,

25
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,545
so we're allowed
to beat them up and cuss at them.

26
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,090
But others have no right
to criticize our kids.

27
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:01,301
Who was it?

28
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:04,637
I'll go over there
and slap some sense into them.

29
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:07,682
Tell me. Who was it?

30
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,600
Who was it?

31
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,106
Mr. Kim, the blacksmith at the market.

32
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:18,651
And?

33
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,618
Hye-ja, the haenyeo.

34
00:05:30,288 --> 00:05:32,081
Mr. Jang, the ice seller.

35
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,876
Who else?

36
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,295
You!

37
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,133
You…

38
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,387
bad-mouthed my Yeong-ju
and called her a girl who slept around.

39
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,767
Apologize.

40
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,270
I want an apology.

41
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,081
I'm sorry.

42
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:29,430
Thank you.

43
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,852
You should go now.

44
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:39,732
I told Yeong-ju to come home.

45
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:45,238
So you should also…

46
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:50,785
I mean, In-gown.

47
00:06:54,288 --> 00:06:56,082
You should also forgive Hyeon.

48
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:03,756
Go home.

49
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,029
And…

50
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:30,616
forgive me too.

51
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,036
From now on,

52
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:37,540
I'll treat you like a big brother.

53
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:44,797
We're not brothers.

54
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,384
We're in-laws now.

55
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,391
You should go, my in-law.

56
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,103
You look exhausted.

57
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:03,274
Thank you,

58
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,777
my in-law.

59
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,868
Come home right now.

60
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:58,913
Don't forget to thank Ms. Kang

61
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,916
before you leave.

62
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,628
Okay.

63
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,634
DONG-SEOK AND SEON-A 2

64
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,806
Give me four carrots
and four bundles of spinach.

65
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:19,809
Okay.

66
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,980
That will be 50,000 won,
including the stuff from last time.

67
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,733
Give me a 5,000 won discount.

68
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,860
Why do you always ask for a discount?

69
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:31,445
I don't have money.

70
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:34,490
Then don't eat.

71
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:38,244
There. 45,000 won's worth.

72
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,205
Unbelievable. Here.

73
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,833
I'm never buying from you again.

74
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:47,378
-Even if I give you this?
-Goodness.

75
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,213
You should've offered me that earlier.

76
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,215
Thanks.

77
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,134
And you? Hairtail or Spanish mackerel?

78
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:54,468
Fillet them for me.

79
00:09:55,177 --> 00:09:56,887
My hands aren't what they used to be.

80
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:01,100
That would normally cost you
an extra 3,000 won.

81
00:10:01,183 --> 00:10:02,893
But I'll do it for free just for you.

82
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:06,522
Hey, come on. Stop rummaging.

83
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:06,707
Look at this.

84
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,503
That's not how you do it. This is how.

85
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:12,838
-Look.
-No, this is how it's done.

86
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:16,717
It'll be over soon.

87
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,595
Nice, I won. I won this round.

88
00:11:19,678 --> 00:11:21,931
PREMIUM INTERNET CAFE

89
00:11:22,014 --> 00:11:25,226
It was supposed to be harder.

90
00:11:26,852 --> 00:11:28,979
Hey, what's your name?

91
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:33,234
I asked you a question. What's your name?

92
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,570
Why aren't you answering my question?

93
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:37,905
I'm a lot older than you.

94
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,574
Hey, where do you live?

95
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,829
You're in middle school, aren't you?

96
00:11:47,498 --> 00:11:49,750
You spend way too much time at the arcade.

97
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,794
You moved here, didn't you?

98
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,505
From Seoul? Busan?

99
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,424
Daegu? Mokpo?

100
00:11:57,675 --> 00:11:58,801
Hey.

101
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,594
Hey.

102
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,640
Hey! I asked you where you're from.

103
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:07,810
Who was that?

104
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:09,603
Shut up.

105
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:12,690
PARK JAE-GU

106
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,108
It's just that

107
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,487
she's always at the arcade
instead of going home,

108
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:20,614
so I got worried.

109
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,658
Who are you to worry about her?

110
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,338
Hey.

111
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,549
Hey, Lee Dong-seok.

112
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,551
Get up.

113
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:52,104
Get up, you punk. My brother's waiting.

114
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,984
Look at you ignoring me.
I'm going to count to three.

115
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,777
One, two, three.

116
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,705
-Hey, Dong-seok.
-Come here.

117
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,084
Look at this bastard.

118
00:13:14,793 --> 00:13:16,587
-You little…
-Take this.

119
00:13:17,588 --> 00:13:19,757
You bastard. Jeez.

120
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:22,551
You damn loser.

121
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:27,348
I'm busy, so let's call it a day.
There's more waiting for you tomorrow.

122
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,767
Damn you.

123
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:32,561
Let's go.

124
00:13:56,585 --> 00:13:59,046
FRESH MILK

125
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:11,600
MY TIME CHOCOLATE BAR

126
00:15:58,374 --> 00:15:59,792
Damn it.

127
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,672
-See you, Dong-seok.
-Bye.

128
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:09,134
ARCADE

129
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,372
Do you want a ride?

130
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,774
You might fall. Hold on tight.

131
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:15,409
Do you want me to drop you off
at the usual bus stop?

132
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,287
Or your place since it's raining?

133
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:22,750
My place. Let's take the road
along the coast this time.

134
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:26,086
-Then you'll get home late.
-It's okay.

135
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,550
Aren't you scared of me?

136
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,511
No, I'm not.

137
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,907
Gosh, it's pouring outside.
Where are you coming from?

138
00:17:55,491 --> 00:17:58,035
Where do you think?
I was out selling stuff.

139
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,872
What did you do with all your money?
Why not buy a house?

140
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:04,458
You always sleep out,
in your truck, or at this motel.

141
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:05,667
Gosh, get lost.

142
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,962
What's with all the nagging? Seriously.

143
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,719
Who's that lady in Room 201?

144
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,015
Why are you so curious about her?
She's just a guest at your motel.

145
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,726
No, it's just that

146
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:26,647
I heard you saved her
from committing suicide.

147
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,275
Why did you have to bring
a woman like that to my motel?

148
00:18:32,736 --> 00:18:34,154
Don't give me that look.

149
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:37,241
It's not just Pureung-ri.
Everyone in Seogwipo City knows.

150
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:40,119
That a lady from Seoul jumped into the sea
and was saved by the haenyeos.

151
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:41,954
Listen.

152
00:18:42,037 --> 00:18:45,040
I can't sleep at night
because of that lady you brought.

153
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,586
You're married.
Why would you lose sleep over her?

154
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,629
Do you have insomnia?

155
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:53,006
Hey.

156
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,468
That lady in Room 201
isn't right in the head.

157
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:59,304
I don't know what she's so busy with,

158
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,307
but she leaves at dawn
and comes back late at night.

159
00:19:02,391 --> 00:19:07,104
Every time I greet her and say,
"Good morning, did you sleep well?"

160
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,605
she doesn't respond at all.

161
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,607
She just looks away and smirks.

162
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,652
On top of that,
she left two days ago in her car.

163
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,738
She hasn't come here in three days.

164
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,116
I keep wondering to myself
if that suicidal woman

165
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:21,743
smoked a briquette in her car this time

166
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:25,747
or quietly hung herself
inside her motel room…

167
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,251
It's seriously making me
have a nervous breakdown.

168
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,212
Who exactly is that woman in Room 201?

169
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,047
What's your relationship with her?

170
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,841
Bring me the key to her room.

171
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:39,011
We can't go inside when she's not here.

172
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:41,180
Will you take responsibility?

173
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:45,267
If anything happens, it's on you. Hey.

174
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,534
Gosh, that startled me!

175
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,455
Hey, Dong-seok. Check the bathroom…

176
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,876
Dong-seok, is she in there?

177
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,216
SEON-A

178
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:21,011
Hey. Dong-seok.

179
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,305
Is she not there?

180
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,227
Is she in there or not?

181
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:31,605
Where are you going? Where…

182
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,278
Gosh. Hey.

183
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:42,908
Hey! Are you going to look for her?

184
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:46,245
You can't go looking for her
in this weather!

185
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:50,082
Just go tomorrow!
Look for her tomorrow once the rain stops!

186
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:54,461
No one cleans their room like that
before committing suicide!

187
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:56,421
So just look for her tomorrow!

188
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:01,093
My goodness, he's so impatient.

189
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,974
Dong-seok, be careful!

190
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,225
DANGER
RISK OF FALLING

191
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:30,455
SEON-A

192
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,100
-Damn it!
-Goodness, stop!

193
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:52,644
-Who do you think you are?
-Let him go.

194
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:56,440
Have you lost your mind?
You lost all of Dad's money!

195
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:59,693
I want that money back!

196
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:02,779
Will you please stop?
Every time you drink…

197
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:06,283
You had the guts to lose…

198
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:30,474
My dad's fighting with my uncle again.

199
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,641
Can I sleep here?

200
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,016
What are you doing here?

201
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,061
Dong-seok. You loser.

202
00:23:18,146 --> 00:23:21,149
What are you looking at,
you illegitimate bastard?

203
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,095
Come inside.

204
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:17,873
I'm done changing.

205
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:30,135
Dong-seok, do you get beaten up
because you're not strong enough?

206
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,724
Lie down.

207
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:54,701
I'm strong.

208
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,413
Then why do you let them beat you up?

209
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,042
So that my mom, who's a mistress,

210
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,296
will get heartbroken
after she sees me like this.

211
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:10,675
But still…

212
00:25:13,762 --> 00:25:15,138
I bet it hurts.

213
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,866
You're shivering.

214
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,161
I won't do anything else.

215
00:25:44,918 --> 00:25:46,044
What if…

216
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,880
someone comes in?

217
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:52,008
No one in this house

218
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:55,470
cares about me.

219
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,932
Go to sleep.

220
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,522
SEON-A

221
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,358
What's your problem?

222
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:54,195
Hey, you called.
I just saw the missed call notification.

223
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:55,739
Where are you?

224
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:58,825
The place where I used to live
with my dad.

225
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,494
So am I.

226
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,331
But the houses are gone. It's a ranch now.

227
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:06,041
Where in the world are you?

228
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:16,760
Dong-seok.

229
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,056
Dong-seok.

230
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,607
Dong-seok?

231
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,352
Dong-seok.

232
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:51,980
Dong-seok…

233
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,408
SEON-A

234
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:10,957
What are you doing?

235
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,043
I didn't know that loser knew
how to hit someone.

236
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:16,296
-What are you doing?
-Are you going to hit me?

237
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,630
Go ahead and hit me.

238
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:37,484
-Someone stop him!
-Stop!

239
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:39,194
I'm in front of Oseong Arcade.

240
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:40,820
-That's enough!
-Stop!

241
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:42,739
Officer, please hurry.

242
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:45,325
-A thug is about to kill someone.
-That's enough!

243
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:46,534
Just stop!

244
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,865
SEON-A

245
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,994
Remember when we were both young

246
00:30:31,287 --> 00:30:32,580
and living in Jeju?

247
00:30:34,082 --> 00:30:35,542
Why did you do that to me?

248
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,554
Was it supposed to be a joke?

249
00:30:51,850 --> 00:30:54,102
Answer me.
Why did you do that to me back then?

250
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,442
-Dong-seok.
-I was just an 18-year-old boy.

251
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,237
I had absolutely no joy in life.

252
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,407
Being with you was the only thing
that made me happy.

253
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:08,908
So why did you do that to me?

254
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:11,744
Damn it.

255
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:23,172
The motel owner is worried that
you're not coming back.

256
00:31:24,007 --> 00:31:25,300
Listen.

257
00:31:25,383 --> 00:31:28,094
If you want to kill yourself,
do it somewhere else, quietly.

258
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,055
Why did you have to come to Jeju?

259
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:34,100
You're messing with my head again.

260
00:31:35,059 --> 00:31:38,396
Do me a favor. I'm asking you this
from the bottom of my heart.

261
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,899
Just stay out of my life!

262
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:41,900
SEON-A

263
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,747
SEON-A

264
00:32:42,835 --> 00:32:44,170
What do you want?

265
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,547
You asked me why I did that to you

266
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:50,385
and just left without even
giving me a chance to answer.

267
00:32:52,553 --> 00:32:53,554
Come back.

268
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:55,181
I'll tell you.

269
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,601
Why I did that to you back then.

270
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:03,314
Damn it.

271
00:34:08,629 --> 00:34:10,506
Why did you sleep with Jae-gu?

272
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:15,178
Did you hit on him?

273
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,391
Or did he force you to do it?

274
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:26,522
Do you…

275
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:32,070
even know that I loved you back then?

276
00:34:38,201 --> 00:34:39,452
You said you'd answer.

277
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:42,163
You said you'd tell me why.

278
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,874
I know.

279
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,043
You know?

280
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,673
You knew that,
yet you slept with my friend?

281
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,219
What's your problem?

282
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,348
I couldn't ask the person I loved

283
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,560
to ruin me.

284
00:35:09,232 --> 00:35:10,483
I couldn't

285
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,444
ask the guy

286
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,364
who loved me

287
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,367
to ruin me.

288
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,370
You would've declined.

289
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,051
I may not remember much,

290
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:41,764
but you were also all I had back then.

291
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,518
And I loved you.

292
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:42,783
I asked you to go on a trip with me,
but why haven't you replied?

293
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,745
Are you playing hard to get?

294
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,751
What's with that look?

295
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:59,425
"I'm not ready
to take the next step with you."

296
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,802
Is that what you're saying?

297
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,141
This is boring. Forget it.

298
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:28,037
What do you think about people
who lie all the time?

299
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,624
I hate them. They're absolutely the worst.

300
00:37:35,711 --> 00:37:37,797
Have you ever lied in your life?

301
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:40,633
I have.

302
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,135
When I was little.

303
00:37:44,178 --> 00:37:47,848
I only needed 10,000 won for a book,
but I asked my parents for 20,000 won.

304
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,852
And after you grew up?

305
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,855
I'm not sure.

306
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:58,192
Oh, wait.

307
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:01,028
I guess I'm lying right now.

308
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:12,081
The fact that you still haven't given me
an answer about going on a trip together

309
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:15,167
is really getting on my nerves right now.

310
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,837
And I'm honestly a little hurt,

311
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:22,216
but I'm acting like I'm fine,
so I guess that counts as a lie.

312
00:38:36,188 --> 00:38:37,523
What's that smirk?

313
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:41,068
Hey.

314
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,156
If you don't like me that much,
let's just end it here.

315
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,331
-Are you testing the water?
-Yes.

316
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:56,792
-"Yes"?
-You can do the same with me.

317
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,755
You can't just thoughtlessly trust someone

318
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,799
when they haven't done anything
to gain your trust.

319
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:06,719
We're not kids.

320
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:09,889
You have a point.

321
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,143
Let's go on a trip.

322
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,647
-I didn't do anything to gain your trust.
-You did.

323
00:39:18,731 --> 00:39:20,232
-When?
-Just now.

324
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:22,026
You told me you don't lie.

325
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:24,445
That's good enough.

326
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:29,825
You're very peculiar.

327
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:37,583
Let's go ride a bike at Gapa Island.

328
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:41,545
Gapa Island sounds great.

329
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:43,297
Okay.

330
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:51,263
Meeting someone new and breaking up

331
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:54,683
Somehow feels like a child's game

332
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:58,604
It's like the sad story of small fairies

333
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,774
Who travel far away on clouds

334
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:06,237
Although we can't fly and all we do is cry

335
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,073
Love is like a beautiful dream

336
00:40:09,156 --> 00:40:10,491
What are you all doing here?

337
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:12,576
Gosh, you guys make a great couple.

338
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,620
-Toward the castle
-We're not a couple.

339
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:15,996
Bullshit, you crazy brat.

340
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:22,545
My love for you

341
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:24,338
We're not a couple.

342
00:40:24,422 --> 00:40:27,091
We had some stuff to talk about
as captain and haenyeo.

343
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:28,926
Right?

344
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:31,137
Are you planning an independence movement?

345
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,057
What kind of business do a captain and
a haenyeo have to discuss till this late?

346
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:36,600
You can't fool me.

347
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,602
Jeong-jun, don't go out with her.

348
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,188
She has a temper and can be really wild.

349
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,607
It's fine. I can live with that.

350
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:47,486
Goodness, Jeong-jun.

351
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,530
-You're a man. A good man.
-A good man.

352
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:52,992
Gosh. Enjoy what you have, you brat.

353
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,743
-It's nothing serious.
-Jeez.

354
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,953
Stop lying.

355
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:59,457
Hey, did you close up the bar properly?

356
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,625
We made 300,000 won tonight.

357
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:07,756
-My love for you
-See you.

358
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,633
Yeong-ok.

359
00:41:10,176 --> 00:41:12,678
Byeol-i says guys like him are rare.

360
00:41:14,221 --> 00:41:16,265
I think so too.

361
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,272
I want to watch you sleep

362
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:26,442
Then kiss you and fly away

363
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,280
Although we can't fly
and all we do is cry…

364
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,215
I'm serious. Nothing happened.

365
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:55,554
Just as Jae-gu started
taking his clothes off,

366
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:59,808
he stopped and said, "I can't.
Dong-seok will kill me if he finds out."

367
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,144
Then he left.

368
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:11,320
"A thug is about to kill someone."
That's what you said that day.

369
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,489
Am I a thug to you?

370
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,328
You looked as if

371
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,706
you were ready to kill someone.

372
00:42:23,707 --> 00:42:25,543
It was to make you stop hitting him.

373
00:42:29,088 --> 00:42:31,173
I didn't call the police.

374
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,260
It was just to threaten you.

375
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:48,023
You were just a 14-year-old girl.

376
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,902
What made you want to ruin your life?

377
00:43:02,162 --> 00:43:03,581
I thought if I acted out,

378
00:43:05,124 --> 00:43:07,835
my dad would come to his senses,

379
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:10,045
quit drinking,

380
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:13,841
start working again for me,

381
00:43:15,175 --> 00:43:18,929
stop getting into fights,
and stop being so angry.

382
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,183
I thought

383
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,728
he would take care of me

384
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,982
just like how he used to
when my mom was still alive.

385
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:41,952
If you were so curious,

386
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:46,248
why didn't you ask me
when we met each other seven years ago?

387
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,002
I didn't want to ask back then.

388
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,671
But now, I do.

389
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:55,049
Is that a problem?

390
00:43:58,385 --> 00:44:00,179
I'm starting to crave alcohol.

391
00:44:01,805 --> 00:44:03,015
Go ahead and drink.

392
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,893
Don't you have alcohol in your truck?

393
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:08,020
I don't drink when I'm with a woman.

394
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:16,403
To you,

395
00:44:17,363 --> 00:44:20,199
I'm probably just a guy
you once grew up with.

396
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,578
But like always,

397
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,207
you're still a woman to me.

398
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,010
Do you have water?

399
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:21,969
What?

400
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,179
Nothing.

401
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:27,808
Being here with you

402
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,519
feels strange,

403
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,980
awkward,

404
00:45:34,731 --> 00:45:36,191
and familiar at the same time.

405
00:45:37,234 --> 00:45:38,569
That's just how I feel.

406
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,198
Just like back then,

407
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,076
you seem rough on the outside,

408
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:48,996
but you're a warmhearted guy.

409
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,749
What makes you think that?

410
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:54,793
Because I gave you water?

411
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,796
What kind of life did you live?

412
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,303
You were married,
and you even had a child together.

413
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:05,888
You should have higher standards.

414
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,189
I guess the sun's coming up.

415
00:46:17,774 --> 00:46:19,359
Let's go see the sunrise.

416
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:28,952
They must have gotten rid of the house
you used to live in with your stepfather.

417
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,289
Great. I hated that place.

418
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:36,460
Why did you take pills earlier?
Are you sick?

419
00:46:38,462 --> 00:46:39,838
They're for my depression.

420
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:42,591
Why? Do you feel depressed?

421
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,635
Yes.

422
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:47,137
Every day?

423
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,640
No, just sometimes.

424
00:46:50,933 --> 00:46:52,017
Why?

425
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:53,769
Since when?

426
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,734
Probably since the day my dad died.

427
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:05,656
The day you beat up Jae-gu,

428
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:10,577
my dad told me we should go for a drive.

429
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:14,289
He took me to a beach far away.

430
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:18,210
He suddenly asked me to buy him bread,
saying he was hungry.

431
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,171
When I came back with bread,

432
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:25,217
he was already driving his car

433
00:47:26,134 --> 00:47:27,511
into the sea.

434
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,902
I guess my dad was

435
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,573
going through a lot more
than I thought he was.

436
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,914
His business went bankrupt,

437
00:47:56,748 --> 00:47:59,751
he got divorced, and my mom got remarried.

438
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,338
I guess it was all hard to bear.

439
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:07,342
That day, I went back to Seoul

440
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:10,470
because my mom came and picked me up.

441
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:23,942
Life can be funny.

442
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:28,447
I can't believe I feel comfortable
talking about this.

443
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,618
Maybe it's because it's you.

444
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:37,581
It's been over 20 years already.
You can't be crying over it till now.

445
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,503
Do you want to be like my mom
who's never happy

446
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:48,550
and who acts as if she carries the weight
of the entire world on her shoulders?

447
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:50,552
I find that weirder.

448
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,267
What about you?

449
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:00,395
When did you leave Jeju?

450
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,439
The same day you did.

451
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:07,569
I stole all the jewelry and cash
I could find at my stepfather's house

452
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,156
even though my mom was watching,

453
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,284
and I left determined

454
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:17,287
to never return
to this damned place ever again.

455
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:19,748
But damn it.

456
00:49:21,541 --> 00:49:24,711
As you can see, I ended up coming back.

457
00:49:30,008 --> 00:49:31,385
Why did you get divorced?

458
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:40,352
I didn't want to get a divorce
for my child's sake.

459
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:46,191
But my husband no longer wanted
to deal with my depression.

460
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:47,859
That's why.

461
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,530
Did he not know about it
when you guys were dating?

462
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:53,573
He did.

463
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,785
He's a crazy bastard.

464
00:49:57,577 --> 00:50:00,956
Instead of pitying his wife,
he just dumped you?

465
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:05,585
He probably said he loved you
just so he could get into your pants.

466
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:08,964
Then that nasty jerk got sick of you
after you guys got married.

467
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:11,633
He should've tried harder for the kid.

468
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:14,428
I might as well just
crack that bastard's skull open.

469
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:17,973
You think that's funny?

470
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,851
Gosh.

471
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:23,437
I get why you have depression.

472
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,194
I wish I could learn to cuss like you.

473
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,198
I bet it helps you feel much better.

474
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:37,451
What's there to learn? Just cuss.

475
00:50:38,285 --> 00:50:40,912
Call him a crazy bastard.
Is that so hard to say?

476
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:43,498
Go ahead. Just say it.

477
00:50:48,628 --> 00:50:49,755
Damned…

478
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,883
bastard.

479
00:50:53,675 --> 00:50:55,427
You make it sound like a compliment.

480
00:50:59,306 --> 00:51:01,850
You fucking ungrateful bastard!

481
00:51:01,933 --> 00:51:05,437
You had her when you wanted her,
and now you just leave?

482
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:10,400
I'll crack your head open,
you fucking jackass.

483
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,862
Damn it.

484
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,463
Hey!

485
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:33,882
You crazy bastard!

486
00:51:35,133 --> 00:51:36,551
You damn bastard!

487
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,139
Give me my son back!

488
00:51:42,015 --> 00:51:43,767
Give Yeol back to me!

489
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:47,020
Give me my son back!

490
00:51:49,105 --> 00:51:50,899
I want Yeol!

491
00:51:52,651 --> 00:51:54,528
Give him back to me!

492
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,614
Give me back my son!

493
00:51:58,406 --> 00:51:59,825
He's mine!

494
00:52:02,327 --> 00:52:03,995
He's my son!

495
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,083
Give me my son back!

496
00:52:09,167 --> 00:52:11,086
He's my son!

497
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:14,798
Fuck!

498
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,926
You crazy bastard!

499
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,431
Crazy bastard!

500
00:52:26,268 --> 00:52:28,854
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

501
00:52:45,579 --> 00:52:46,746
Come here, babies.

502
00:52:56,298 --> 00:53:00,135
All right. It's time for food. Okay.

503
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,140
There you go. Enjoy.

504
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,143
Enjoy your food. Eat up.

505
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:15,942
Eat up.

506
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,441
It's up to the haenyeos

507
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,861
to decide whether or not
Yeong-ok should leave the team.

508
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,238
Why do you care?

509
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,701
The thing is, I like Yeong-ok.

510
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:13,708
She likes working as a haenyeo.
She loves the island too.

511
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,128
Hye-ja…

512
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:20,548
keeps calling Yeong-ok a liar.

513
00:54:20,632 --> 00:54:23,510
But that's because she doesn't know…

514
00:54:23,593 --> 00:54:27,555
Are you going to end it with Yeong-ok
if I kick her off the team?

515
00:54:27,639 --> 00:54:28,556
No.

516
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,892
Then why does it matter?

517
00:54:31,601 --> 00:54:35,605
I don't care if Yeong-ok is a liar or not.

518
00:54:35,689 --> 00:54:39,651
No one in their right mind
would lie for no reason.

519
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,278
If she lied about something,

520
00:54:42,362 --> 00:54:45,782
she probably did it for a good reason.

521
00:54:46,574 --> 00:54:50,453
But if she keeps
harvesting the way she does,

522
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,956
she'll eventually get herself killed.

523
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:59,170
Yeong-ok is too greedy.

524
00:54:59,254 --> 00:55:03,258
She keeps risking her life at sea
just to catch more abalones.

525
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:06,636
She's just working hard to make money.

526
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:09,806
Plus, no one will die
as long as you're there.

527
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,766
If anything happens, you can save her.

528
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,644
Just like how you saved me from drowning.

529
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:20,984
I'm old now.

530
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:25,613
When we're out in the sea,

531
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,825
you're the youngest
and the fastest among all of us.

532
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,827
Please help Yeong-ok.

533
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:40,712
I'll help you with that.

534
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,089
Here.

535
00:55:47,093 --> 00:55:50,847
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

536
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,685
Watch the door.

537
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:58,521
-He's a kind kid.
-He is.

538
00:56:01,399 --> 00:56:04,694
-Did you throw up again?
-Don't mind it.

539
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,615
It'll all be over soon.

540
00:56:14,496 --> 00:56:15,705
Goodness.

541
00:56:17,165 --> 00:56:20,585
How did that flower manage
to bloom there all by itself?

542
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,039
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes, totally.

543
00:56:58,123 --> 00:56:59,582
-Give me your bag.
-Okay.

544
00:57:02,877 --> 00:57:04,045
Let's go.

545
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:07,549
I'm right on time, right?

546
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:11,136
-Did our baby enjoy breakfast?
-Yes.

547
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:14,139
I want to live together.

548
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,183
Don't even say that.
Our dads will throw another fit.

549
00:57:17,934 --> 00:57:20,603
I'm just glad that
they let us have the baby.

550
00:57:25,442 --> 00:57:27,360
Do you really not regret quitting school?

551
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,695
Of course, I don't.

552
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,239
Right, I became a full-time worker
at the restaurant yesterday.

553
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:32,490
Really?

554
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:37,120
I'll make enough money
for your diapers and powdered milk.

555
00:57:42,041 --> 00:57:43,084
You punks.

556
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,961
What do you think you're doing?

557
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:49,048
How dare you kids
kiss each other in broad daylight?

558
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:51,634
You must be out of your minds.

559
00:57:52,218 --> 00:57:53,219
Myeong-bo.

560
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:55,763
Let them be.

561
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,349
They're a married couple now.

562
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,977
We both approved.

563
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,189
It's mind-blowing, isn't it?

564
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:08,568
Those two kids are married
and are going to be parents.

565
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:11,446
They each have a father-in-law now.

566
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:17,452
I'm just as flabbergasted as you are.

567
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:20,580
Right, In-law?

568
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,583
Tell me about it, In-law.

569
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:25,752
Hey.

570
00:58:26,586 --> 00:58:27,670
Go to work.

571
00:58:33,051 --> 00:58:34,344
Unbelievable.

572
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,248
Do you know how to use this?

573
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:09,379
I used to do interior design,
so I have plenty of experience.

574
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,177
You're my savior.

575
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,726
I'm impressed.
You're stronger than I thought.

576
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:00,597
I have a question.

577
01:00:01,681 --> 01:00:04,267
A while ago,
you said I was your first love.

578
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:09,480
Then why were you so appalled
when I kissed you seven years ago?

579
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:10,857
It was humiliating.

580
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:15,403
My feelings for you were long gone.

581
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,948
I loved you when I was little.

582
01:00:19,532 --> 01:00:20,950
But seven years ago,

583
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:24,412
I was in love with my ex-husband,
although we were on a break back then.

584
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,374
Is that so hard to understand?

585
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,380
You're not going to tell me some lie

586
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,050
like, "you were the only woman
in my life," are you?

587
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,386
Dong-seok.

588
01:00:41,721 --> 01:00:43,181
Can you help me with this?

589
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,062
I can't seem to connect them.

590
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:58,863
It all seems so convenient for you.

591
01:01:00,281 --> 01:01:02,283
When you were little, you loved me.

592
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:05,745
Seven years ago, you considered me
a guy you once grew up with.

593
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:08,539
And now, you treat me like I'm a worker.

594
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:12,210
It must be nice
to think things so conveniently.

595
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:20,259
PARK HYEONG-SEOP

596
01:01:23,971 --> 01:01:25,390
Why aren't you picking up?

597
01:01:25,973 --> 01:01:27,642
He's a colleague from my old job.

598
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:30,103
He's calling about a job in Seoul.

599
01:01:31,145 --> 01:01:32,855
I'm not going, so I'm not picking up.

600
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:39,612
Then was I the only girl

601
01:01:40,405 --> 01:01:43,241
you ever had feelings for?

602
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:47,537
I did date other women.

603
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,331
But you see,

604
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:54,252
maybe it's because
I started off on the wrong foot,

605
01:01:54,836 --> 01:01:56,212
but it never really lasted.

606
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:01,092
I bet you hated me
every time you broke up.

607
01:02:04,303 --> 01:02:05,930
Are you really going to live here

608
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:09,392
-and pay a year's worth of rent?
-Yes.

609
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:11,894
That's the plan.

610
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:18,651
By yourself?

611
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:22,238
No. With my kid.

612
01:02:46,137 --> 01:02:49,724
Next week, there's going to be
a custody trial in Seoul.

613
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:56,230
If I win, I'm going
to bring Yeol here right away.

614
01:02:58,566 --> 01:03:00,610
We'll have to stay at a motel for a bit,

615
01:03:03,112 --> 01:03:05,281
but we'll eventually live here.

616
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,203
We'll be happy here.

617
01:03:11,162 --> 01:03:13,539
Yeol and I both.

618
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,502
What if you lose the trial?

619
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,463
That won't happen.

620
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:26,803
The decision isn't up to you.
It's up to the judge.

621
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,893
Don't you think you might lose?

622
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:37,897
-No.
-Well, you should think about it.

623
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:45,530
Answer me this.

624
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:50,326
If you win the trial
and bring your kid here,

625
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:51,786
you'll be happy.

626
01:03:52,703 --> 01:03:55,081
But if you lose
and fail to bring your kid here,

627
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,875
does that mean you'll be miserable?

628
01:03:59,794 --> 01:04:00,795
Is that it?

629
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:03,589
I won't lose.

630
01:04:05,091 --> 01:04:08,177
I'll win the trial.

631
01:04:19,605 --> 01:04:20,773
She's driving me crazy.

632
01:04:55,850 --> 01:04:58,519
How did you end up becoming such a fool?

633
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:00,855
Because there's no next time.

634
01:05:01,606 --> 01:05:03,524
-Oh, my goodness!
-I got it!

635
01:05:03,608 --> 01:05:04,984
You must really like her.

636
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:07,653
-Say hello!
-I'm in my camisole!

637
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:12,116
She's the most loyal person ever.
She's my best friend!

638
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:14,118
Who's that woman you're seeing?

639
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:20,791
Despite all those lights,
I can't see any of them.

640
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:23,502
I'm not telling you not to be sad.

641
01:05:23,586 --> 01:05:25,713
Just don't be sad
all the time like my mom.

642
01:05:30,885 --> 01:05:35,890
