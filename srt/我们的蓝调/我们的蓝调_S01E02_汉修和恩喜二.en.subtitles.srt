1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,104
HAN-SU AND EUN-HUI

2
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,692
MEMORIES OF MOKPO COME IN WAVES AFTER
A BITTERSWEET REUNION WITH AN OLD FRIEND

3
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,761
It's the sea!

4
00:00:52,844 --> 00:00:53,970
7 YEARS AGO

5
00:00:54,053 --> 00:00:56,556
It's the sea!

6
00:00:57,432 --> 00:01:00,477
-It's the sea!
-It's the sea!

7
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:13,907
I love it.

8
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,117
Hang tight. I'm going to turn.

9
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,368
Turn?

10
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,172
It's so refreshing!

11
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:32,509
Dong-seok!

12
00:01:33,134 --> 00:01:34,385
I'm going to turn!

13
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,099
It's so refreshing!

14
00:01:45,021 --> 00:01:46,064
Dong-seok!

15
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,316
It's really refreshing.

16
00:01:51,069 --> 00:01:52,904
-Let's go over there!
-Okay!

17
00:02:57,886 --> 00:02:59,012
This is wonderful.

18
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,139
Who are you calling?

19
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,476
A taxi. I'm going back to Seoul.

20
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,279
You don't like me.

21
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,368
Okay. I'll drop you off. Get in.

22
00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,620
Give me back my phone.

23
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,583
If I do, will you get in?

24
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:13,670
Yes.

25
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,855
-Sit next to me.
-No, I'll sit back here.

26
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:35,441
Sit here…

27
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,561
Take the expressway.

28
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,108
No.

29
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,535
Why did you come with me
in the first place?

30
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,120
To see the sea.

31
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,710
Did you seriously think a man and a woman
would travel this far late at night

32
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,004
just to see the sea?

33
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:40,757
Hey.

34
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,217
Don't talk to me as if I'm your friend.

35
00:05:44,302 --> 00:05:46,429
We're not best buddies
or anything like that.

36
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:48,389
I'm not your friend.

37
00:05:49,974 --> 00:05:52,435
I'm a man and you're a woman.

38
00:05:55,146 --> 00:05:56,689
Let's be honest.

39
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:00,068
I know you have feelings for me.

40
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,445
That's why we always hang out
and go clubbing.

41
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,906
And that's why you came
all the way here with me.

42
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:07,116
Aren't I right?

43
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,786
Me?

44
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,748
You?

45
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,960
I have feelings for you?

46
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:43,653
Why?

47
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,365
Am I not worth having feelings for?

48
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,034
Is that it?

49
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,122
Rice puffs.

50
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,958
Rice puffs.

51
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,794
Corn puffs.

52
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,548
Nostalgic rice crackers.

53
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,217
Nostalgic rice crackers.

54
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,595
Nickel-silver pots.

55
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:16,185
It's 21,000 won,
but just give me 20,000 won.

56
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,482
Goodness. You gave me a discount. Thanks.

57
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,987
Spinach is expensive.

58
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:28,448
Have cabbage. It's cheaper. 2,000 won.

59
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:31,200
Do you have a stainless ladle?

60
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,786
-And anchovies.
-A stainless ladle and anchovies. Here.

61
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,289
-Goodness.
-And a stainless ladle…

62
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:40,418
-Right.
-What?

63
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,003
You wanted headache medicine.

64
00:07:42,086 --> 00:07:43,171
-It's 9,000 won.
-Right.

65
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,338
-That'll be…
-Yes?

66
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:46,924
-a total of 25,000 won.
-Okay.

67
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:48,843
Do I have that much money on me?

68
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,178
Hang on…

69
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:54,140
One, two…
Oh, dear. I only have 22,000 won.

70
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,058
Jeez. You're always short of money.

71
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:59,270
Thank you. Goodness.

72
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,981
Dong-seok, do you have an axe?

73
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:04,734
-An axe?
-Yes, I'd like one.

74
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,943
Let's see.

75
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,826
Do you want a golden axe or a silver axe?

76
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,495
-Give me the better one.
-This?

77
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:16,704
-Yes.
-Five million won.

78
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:17,788
Five million won?

79
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,465
Grandma, I brought some squid,
your favorite.

80
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:29,008
Come check it out.

81
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,390
Is she not well?
Why isn't she buying anything?

82
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,560
She already bought some
from another truck a few days ago.

83
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:42,772
Another truck?

84
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,775
You didn't need to tell him that.

85
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,195
Why did you tell him that
and make him worry?

86
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:53,199
Dong-seok, do you have batteries
about this big?

87
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,043
Are you not going to shop?

88
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:07,630
Come by next time.

89
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:10,800
Don't be ridiculous. Buy them today.

90
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:13,302
I have your favorite fish

91
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,012
that you always purchase.

92
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,899
You can all leave.

93
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,402
Just leave. I'm closing my shop. Go.

94
00:09:29,485 --> 00:09:31,237
Goodness. Are you serious?

95
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,531
-Why are you closing already?
-Oh, dear.

96
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,117
You can shop at that other truck!

97
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,205
No wonder I didn't have
that many customers.

98
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,584
I thought you'd all be waiting for me.

99
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:47,753
Damn it. I was feeling
under the weather a few days ago.

100
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:51,382
But I didn't rest. I drove,
got on a ship, and crossed the sea.

101
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:54,135
Despite not even making 100,000 won a day,

102
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:55,970
I came here nonetheless.

103
00:09:56,470 --> 00:10:01,017
For the past year, I came here every day
no matter the weather.

104
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:04,395
So how could you purchase items
from another truck?

105
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,566
Then what about me?

106
00:10:08,649 --> 00:10:10,693
All of these ingredients!

107
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,864
Mackerel, squid, spinach, tofu, soft tofu!

108
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,241
I'll have to throw them out
by the end of the day!

109
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:21,203
When it comes to items
such as pots, tools, and clothes,

110
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:23,748
you can buy them elsewhere.

111
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,585
But you should at least
buy the ingredients!

112
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:31,339
We didn't buy anything from there.
We were waiting for you.

113
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,384
-Goodness, at least sell them to us.
-You're all the same!

114
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:39,847
You should have stopped the others
from buying from that other truck.

115
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,307
Did you just watch them?

116
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,227
Then what will happen to me?
How will I make a living?

117
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,688
Calm down. We'll buy from you.

118
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,981
Damn it.

119
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:51,734
-Just take them all.
-Oh, dear.

120
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:52,943
-Goodness.
-Oh, no.

121
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:55,112
They'll all go bad anyway.

122
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,239
-Goodness.
-You can take them all.

123
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,658
-Come on.
-No!

124
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,535
-Put them back.
-Take them! Take them all!

125
00:11:01,619 --> 00:11:03,287
-Dong-seok!
-Goodness.

126
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,998
-Take this too.
-Oh, dear.

127
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,542
Dong-seok!

128
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,962
You always called me
around the clock for favors.

129
00:11:12,046 --> 00:11:15,007
"I need batteries. Send a parcel.
I need some medicine."

130
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:17,218
You wouldn't even do that to your kids.

131
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,012
Then you went
and purchased from another truck?

132
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:22,390
That's not right.

133
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,433
-I'm not coming back.
-Goodness, Dong-seok.

134
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,310
-Let go.
-Dong-seok!

135
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:29,313
Dong-seok, please don't go.

136
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,232
We need you.

137
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:33,776
-Dong-seok.
-I don't want to hear it! Go!

138
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,653
-Dong-seok.
-Goodness.

139
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,196
Dong-seok!

140
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,531
Dong-seok!

141
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:41,575
Oh, no.

142
00:11:42,451 --> 00:11:45,037
Why did that woman
have to mention that other truck?

143
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,124
What if he really never comes back?

144
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:50,876
Oh, dear. That other truck
didn't even have good items.

145
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,296
-What will we do?
-I've even cut ties with my mom.

146
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,799
I can easily do the same with them.

147
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,635
I'll never come back here.

148
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,018
HAN-SU AND EUN-HUI 2

149
00:12:18,821 --> 00:12:20,614
Are you that excited about the reunion?

150
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,792
JEONG-SIK (BROTHER)

151
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,256
What's this video?

152
00:12:37,339 --> 00:12:40,134
You said you'd buy me a place,
so I'm visiting an apartment.

153
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:43,095
It's amazing.
It's 45 pyeong with an ocean view.

154
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,764
Damn it.

155
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,434
Are you insane? As if you have any money.

156
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,811
You're too poor
for an ocean-view apartment.

157
00:12:51,645 --> 00:12:53,772
I ought to break your neck.

158
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,941
Look for a 20-pyeong, multi-unit house.

159
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,284
Damn it.

160
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,250
Do you think what's mine is yours?

161
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:16,253
I earned that money chopping fish heads

162
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:19,757
and removing their intestines and scales.
And you think it's yours?

163
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,717
You little bastard!

164
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,137
You don't even deserve to be my brother.

165
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,680
When will you grow up?

166
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:28,015
Like you have any money.

167
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,059
What? 45 pyeong?

168
00:13:30,142 --> 00:13:32,102
Fine. When you die,

169
00:13:32,186 --> 00:13:35,689
I'll stuff you in a 45-pyeong,
two-floor coffin, you bastard.

170
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,402
-Don't fight with him.
-Turn on the music.

171
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:46,700
Wait just a minute

172
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,203
I will…

173
00:13:49,703 --> 00:13:51,497
Jeez. It's my money.

174
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,003
I paid for your wedding.
And now, you want me to buy you a house?

175
00:13:58,087 --> 00:13:59,797
Will you sponge off me forever?

176
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:02,424
Don't you have eyes?

177
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:06,595
I'm still living with our parents
in that shabby, old house.

178
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,390
How thoughtless can you be?

179
00:14:09,473 --> 00:14:12,017
I'm going to skin you alive, you bastard!

180
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,459
HAN-SUK, I'M REALLY SORRY.
BUT CAN YOU LEND ME 200 MILLION…

181
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:51,640
HAN-SUK, I'M REALLY SORRY

182
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,895
HAN-SUK, I'M REALLY SORRY.
BUT CAN YOU LEND ME 100 MILLION…

183
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,030
HAN-SUK, I'M REALLY SORRY.
BUT CAN YOU LEND ME 200…

184
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,032
Han-suk, I'm really sorry.

185
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:10,492
But can you lend me 200 million won?

186
00:15:10,576 --> 00:15:12,786
I promise to pay you back in a year.

187
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,872
I'll pay you a handsome interest too.

188
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,876
I'm sorry. From your lousy brother.

189
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,513
I'll be there soon.

190
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,146
-I'm Choi Han-su.
-Hello.

191
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,523
He's Mr. Oh.
We couldn't meet him that time,

192
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:42,983
so we left a bottle of liquor.

193
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,360
I see.

194
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,780
He owns four gas stations
in Seogwipo alone.

195
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,492
He's here to take out new insurance.

196
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,868
I see.

197
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,079
Thank you so much.

198
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,956
Right.

199
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,625
His daughter is also
a golfer in the States.

200
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:04,380
She competed in a national tournament
against Choi Bo-ram

201
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:05,673
and won the silver medal.

202
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,300
I see.

203
00:16:08,384 --> 00:16:12,972
She didn't even get into Division Two,
so she's coming back to Korea soon.

204
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,683
I see.

205
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,353
Mr. Choi, you should tend
to your customers.

206
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:20,938
I'll take care of this.

207
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:22,439
Don't forget the reunion.

208
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,525
-I better go.
-Goodbye.

209
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,862
Sir.

210
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,950
-I'll see you around.
-Sure.

211
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,507
All right. Let's sign that contract.

212
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:51,093
Is his salary low?

213
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,512
Well…

214
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,640
-It's lower than mine.
-No wonder.

215
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,227
How could he support his daughter
when he has nothing to his name?

216
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,856
What do you mean?
He's supporting her right now.

217
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:04,815
Oh, please.

218
00:17:05,482 --> 00:17:08,944
The Korean immigrant community there
is as small as Jeju Island.

219
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:11,697
Bo-ram's mother has a bad reputation

220
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,408
among mothers with kids
aspiring to be golfers.

221
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:19,246
I had to tend to a customer,
so I couldn't leave early.

222
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:20,581
I'm on my way right now.

223
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,584
Goodness. Are you okay?

224
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,335
I'm sorry, ma'am.

225
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,424
By the way, what kind of reunion
takes place in broad daylight?

226
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:33,927
-Dazzling
-Hey, what are you saying?

227
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,597
-Dazzling
-What? Can you not hear me?

228
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:38,724
Dazzling

229
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:42,811
-Dazzling
-Hey! What are you saying?

230
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:47,357
I've been reminding you since lunchtime.

231
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:49,234
I've told you a dozen times.

232
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,987
Oh, did you?

233
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:54,740
This gathering isn't just a reunion.

234
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:57,910
It's a business opportunity for us.

235
00:17:57,993 --> 00:18:00,370
Stay on your toes, will you?

236
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,663
Who is that?

237
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:03,040
Han-su.

238
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:07,211
You crazy bastard!

239
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,214
All of your friends are peddlers,

240
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,549
fishermen, and farmers.

241
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:16,845
We'll be at the auction house, farming,
or fishing early tomorrow morning!

242
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,057
We need to hang out
and part ways early, you bastard.

243
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,767
Hurry up!

244
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:25,604
Or else, I'm going to withdraw
all my money from your bank.

245
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:29,358
What's the point of being
a branch manager if you have no customers?

246
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,614
Right. This is In-gwon.

247
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,992
Hey, it's nice to hear your voice.

248
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,539
All right, I get it. I'm almost there.

249
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,083
Is he not coming?

250
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,379
Of course, he'll come.
He always keeps his word.

251
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,841
If he really shows up to our reunion,

252
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:56,093
I'll eat my hat!

253
00:18:57,302 --> 00:18:59,179
He's a bastard, that guy.

254
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:05,018
When he moved his mother
to Seoul eight years ago,

255
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:08,397
he came here late at night
because he didn't want to see us.

256
00:19:08,897 --> 00:19:13,527
He knew very well that you, Eun-hui, and I
treated his mother as if she was ours

257
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,656
for decades after he left for Seoul.

258
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,242
But he never uttered a single "thank you."

259
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:24,204
Hey, that was
because he felt too ashamed to see us.

260
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,082
There should be no shame among friends.

261
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:30,252
Jeez, he's just like Ho-sik.

262
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,921
You just love
to talk behind people's backs.

263
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,225
Zip up your pants, will you?

264
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,980
I did it. Okay? So stop.

265
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:52,941
-You little--
-Hey!

266
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,818
Hit me.

267
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:57,029
Hit me unless you're a coward.

268
00:19:57,654 --> 00:19:58,989
-Hit me.
-You little--

269
00:19:59,072 --> 00:20:00,282
Hey!

270
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,075
Just cut it out!

271
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,536
Gosh, why are you guys always fighting?

272
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:05,787
How can I not?

273
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,540
I didn't lend him any money in the past

274
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:11,168
because I knew he was gambling.

275
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,253
But he still resents me for that.

276
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:16,965
I even pulled some strings
to help you with your ice business.

277
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,552
-What an ingrate.
-Yes, I'm an ingrate.

278
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,056
Despite being a year younger than you,
I didn't give you any respect

279
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,433
and only cursed at you.

280
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:27,643
Right?

281
00:20:27,726 --> 00:20:30,270
Plus, my daughter is so smart

282
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,564
that she intimidates your son.

283
00:20:32,648 --> 00:20:35,692
Yeong-ju came first this time as well.

284
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,153
And your son came second.

285
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,155
-First?
-She was the top student.

286
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:41,531
Hey!

287
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,575
You!

288
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:46,203
Jeez.

289
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,707
That's enough.

290
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,377
I ought to make some soup out of you.

291
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,921
Come back and fight me fair and square!

292
00:20:56,004 --> 00:20:59,174
Hey, you can't even
put up a fight against him.

293
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,592
That's enough.

294
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,510
Jeez.

295
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:04,554
Do it for old times' love's sake.

296
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:07,933
Hey, bring him out.

297
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:10,519
Jeez, you're all so lame.

298
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:11,770
Damn it.

299
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:16,233
You're so understanding
with everyone else.

300
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:19,027
Why do you always
get worked up around In-gwon?

301
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:21,280
You guys used to get along so well.

302
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,949
Damn it.

303
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:30,872
He failed a year,
and we ended up in the same grade.

304
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:35,419
You don't respect him either,
so why should I?

305
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:39,506
And if someone as gentle as I am,

306
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:43,135
gets so worked up around him,

307
00:21:43,218 --> 00:21:47,306
then I must have
a good enough reason to be like that.

308
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:49,683
Don't you think so?

309
00:21:50,517 --> 00:21:51,727
Damn it.

310
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,815
Then at least tell me the reason!

311
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:03,030
Gosh, that punk.

312
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,700
Why does she have a bad reputation?

313
00:22:06,783 --> 00:22:10,078
First of all, Bo-ram isn't doing too well

314
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:12,164
because she has yips.

315
00:22:12,247 --> 00:22:15,584
And her mother apparently has
a close relationship with male sponsors.

316
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,962
What concerns me more

317
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:22,924
is that she borrowed money
and hasn't paid them back yet.

318
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,719
She shouldn't have done that
as the wife of a branch manager

319
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,095
whose reputation is crucial.

320
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,431
KARAOKE BAR

321
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:34,770
Honey.

322
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,607
You better come home soon.

323
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,360
Goodness. What's wrong? Are you leaving?

324
00:22:44,738 --> 00:22:46,865
I have a stomachache, so I'm leaving.

325
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,327
You should hang out longer…

326
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:59,002
What a relief.

327
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,213
I'm glad she's leaving.

328
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,886
Han-su, why aren't you here yet?

329
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:10,472
Why did you go there?

330
00:23:10,555 --> 00:23:12,182
It's behind that building!

331
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,352
What is going on? You're lost?

332
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:18,230
All right. Next up is

333
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,691
our dear Eun-hui!

334
00:23:21,775 --> 00:23:23,276
Let's go!

335
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:26,113
-Eun-hui!
-Eun-hui!

336
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:28,115
-Eun-hui!
-Eun-hui!

337
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,366
-Eun-hui!
-Eun-hui!

338
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:34,162
Let's go!

339
00:23:35,705 --> 00:23:38,208
Come to think of it

340
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,086
It was my birthday that day

341
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,505
-Come to think of it!
-Come to think of it!

342
00:23:44,422 --> 00:23:47,634
Getting old

343
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:51,930
Isn't necessarily bad

344
00:23:52,013 --> 00:23:53,807
-It's not bad!
-It's not bad!

345
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,643
You can't pretend

346
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,438
To age gracefully

347
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,901
-Aging wonderfully
-Han-su is here!

348
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,028
You better eat your hat!

349
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:09,739
Make me! You can't even do that.

350
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,285
-It was raining
-It's Han-su!

351
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:14,995
-I can't believe it!
-Han-su!

352
00:24:15,078 --> 00:24:17,831
-Han-su!
-Han-su!

353
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,916
-Han-su!
-Han-su!

354
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,960
-No, I can't.
-Han-su!

355
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,461
I haven't sung in a while.

356
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,922
You better not ruin Eun-hui's moment!

357
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,382
Black, stray cat

358
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:32,179
I couldn't stand

359
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:37,017
The cold, lonely night

360
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:42,063
Time just passed by like that

361
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,191
Let's go!

362
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:50,071
-We all want to believe
-We all want to believe

363
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,783
-That it's beautiful and fun
-That it's beautiful and fun

364
00:24:54,701 --> 00:24:59,039
-But it's just an excuse
-But it's just an excuse

365
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:02,584
-Since we're afraid of living alone
-Since we're afraid of living alone

366
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:07,380
-Our frozen dreams
-Our frozen dreams

367
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:11,218
-Are slowly thawing
-Are slowly thawing

368
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:15,347
It soothes my tongue

369
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:29,110
Hey.

370
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:36,451
-We all want to believe
-We all want to believe

371
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:39,746
-That it's beautiful and fun
-That it's beautiful and fun

372
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:44,918
-But it's just an excuse
-But it's just an excuse

373
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:48,922
-Since we're afraid of living alone
-Since we're afraid of living alone

374
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,174
Why would you attend
your seniors' reunion?

375
00:25:52,467 --> 00:25:54,678
Did you tell him that we were here?

376
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:57,305
He always knows when we're drinking.

377
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:01,184
It soothes my tongue

378
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:11,444
-But it's just an excuse
-But it's just an excuse

379
00:26:11,528 --> 00:26:14,739
-Since we're afraid of living alone
-Since we're afraid of living alone

380
00:26:16,616 --> 00:26:18,743
-It soothes my tongue
-It soothes my tongue

381
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:30,922
Hey, come on!

382
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,716
-Come on!
-Let him be.

383
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:35,552
Hey, Han-su gets a paycheck just like us.

384
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:37,804
He can't afford to pay for all this.

385
00:26:37,887 --> 00:26:39,014
Unbelievable.

386
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,558
Hey, let's chip in like we always do.

387
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,852
-Or I'll just pay for it.
-No!

388
00:26:43,935 --> 00:26:46,604
Hey! Come on! What's with you?

389
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:49,316
What's the matter with him?

390
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:53,153
Branch managers work hard too, you know?

391
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,155
How could you make him pay for everything

392
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,407
when he was the one
who finally visited us?

393
00:26:57,991 --> 00:26:59,534
What are you guys? Thugs?

394
00:26:59,617 --> 00:27:00,785
-It's love
-It's love

395
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,329
Move!

396
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,956
Guys!

397
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:07,417
Hey! Guess what I did?

398
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:11,046
I snatched Han-su's card
and paid for everything.

399
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,089
Good job!

400
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,717
Unbelievable. You really are a thug!

401
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:20,472
Hey! Just stroke his ego, will you?

402
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,516
Han-su, a branch manager,

403
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,602
visited us after 20 years.

404
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:28,980
Do you think treating us peddlers
to some drinks is a big deal?

405
00:27:29,064 --> 00:27:31,649
You just don't understand men at all.

406
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:34,027
No wonder she's still single.

407
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,571
I'd rather be single
than get divorced like you did.

408
00:27:36,654 --> 00:27:37,864
You're right.

409
00:27:37,947 --> 00:27:40,075
I completely agree.

410
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:44,245
Hey, getting a divorce is better than
your wife running away from home!

411
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:47,624
What did you say? You little…

412
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,834
-Damn it.
-You bastard.

413
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,461
Come on.

414
00:27:51,544 --> 00:27:53,922
Come on. What are you doing?

415
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:55,757
Do it properly. All right.

416
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,509
-Come here.
-Damn it, you.

417
00:27:57,592 --> 00:27:59,260
-Come at me.
-Damn it.

418
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,471
Come here. You little…

419
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,431
Fight!

420
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,808
Use your elbow! Hurry!

421
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:06,976
Bite him. There are no rules.

422
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,312
-Come over here.
-Bite him.

423
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:11,189
That's enough. Stop.

424
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:12,440
-Come here.
-Stop.

425
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:21,866
How much was it?

426
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,828
Gosh. 1.8 million won.

427
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,162
Damn it.

428
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,040
Why did you guys drink so much?

429
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,501
I hope your livers rot.

430
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:40,135
Jeez. I should go home.

431
00:28:40,677 --> 00:28:42,470
In-jeong is upset with me.

432
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,100
-Bye.
-He's married.

433
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,185
Don't think of doing anything.

434
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,603
Jeez.

435
00:28:51,187 --> 00:28:52,397
Unbelievable.

436
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:56,943
Hey, Han-su.

437
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:01,865
Hey.

438
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,451
What…

439
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,914
My gosh.

440
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,417
You probably led a good life,

441
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:15,211
but coming here
is going to be the death of you.

442
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,506
Are you okay?

443
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:21,444
Hey.

444
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:28,326
In-gwon, you're home.

445
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,498
Watch your head. Goodness.

446
00:30:34,374 --> 00:30:37,460
Stand up properly, will you?

447
00:30:37,544 --> 00:30:40,588
That's no way to talk to your dad.

448
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:43,633
After all I've done for you, you punk.

449
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,845
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

450
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:47,971
Bye.

451
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:53,685
Aren't you going to say hi?

452
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:58,106
You don't even have the decency to bow.

453
00:30:58,189 --> 00:31:01,025
-What an impudent brat.
-Let's go home.

454
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:05,405
I went through thick and thin
to raise you,

455
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,448
yet you can't even carry your own father.

456
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:11,369
What's the point of raising a son like you

457
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:13,496
who's always second-best in school?

458
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:16,457
-Ho-sik, wake up. Yeong-ju is here.
-What?

459
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,460
Ho-sik, you're home.

460
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:26,885
Stand up straight.

461
00:31:27,677 --> 00:31:29,888
Hey. I got this.

462
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,893
I'm too tired to help you.

463
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:36,936
Okay.

464
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:39,981
Stand up.

465
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:43,484
Yeong-ju, my little sweetheart.

466
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,986
Yes, ma'am.

467
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,282
-Thank you.
-No problem.

468
00:31:49,365 --> 00:31:50,575
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

469
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,328
Hey, Yeong-ju.

470
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:55,246
My top student.

471
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,625
Wait for me. Hey.

472
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,210
Hey, my top student.

473
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:02,837
You brat. Hey!

474
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:50,301
Dong-seok, you can sleep in my bus. Okay?

475
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,512
Dong-seok.

476
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,187
Isn't it funny?

477
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,441
-Yes, it is.
-Right?

478
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,277
Right?

479
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:53,114
Shouldn't you wrap up?

480
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:55,158
Yes, I should.

481
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:57,410
I'll help you close up.

482
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,328
No, let me.

483
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:00,830
You can just leave.

484
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,541
Should I go?

485
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:05,960
No.

486
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,428
What's your relationship with him?

487
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,681
A captain and a haenyeo.

488
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:21,476
Good for you.

489
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,811
I don't crave alcohol anymore.

490
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:26,439
Put it on my tab.

491
00:34:44,165 --> 00:34:45,917
Why are you being so nice to me?

492
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,629
Do you have feelings for me?

493
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,715
Don't. You'll get hurt.

494
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,551
That's up to me to decide.

495
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:58,554
What?

496
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,848
So it's true?

497
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,402
I MISS YOU LIKE CRAZY

498
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,116
Captain, just close up and leave.

499
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:26,916
HANGOVER DRINK

500
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,837
Thank you.

501
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:40,471
Darn it.

502
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,473
What?

503
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:44,809
What is this?

504
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:47,979
Are you serious?

505
00:35:48,563 --> 00:35:50,898
What's so funny?

506
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:57,947
So I asked if you remembered how I lied

507
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:01,325
and said you were the one
who kissed me first.

508
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,368
Was that so funny?

509
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,912
Gosh.

510
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:09,125
Goodness.

511
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:12,170
Hey, I remember…

512
00:36:14,088 --> 00:36:17,717
how you fainted at school.

513
00:36:19,969 --> 00:36:21,554
It was adorable.

514
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:25,183
It was so cute.

515
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:26,893
Jeez.

516
00:36:28,895 --> 00:36:33,316
If you found me so cute,
why didn't you go out with me?

517
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,651
I really liked you back then.

518
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:39,197
Why are you still single?

519
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,617
Because I couldn't find
a decent guy like you.

520
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,829
Let's go home. I didn't drink any alcohol.

521
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:50,124
I'll drive you home
after I go to the toilet. Let's go.

522
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,542
Get in my car.

523
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,401
You've really crossed the line, Han-su.

524
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,654
How could you ask me for money?

525
00:37:19,737 --> 00:37:21,280
I don't have 200 million won.

526
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,575
After graduating high school,
I worked at a factory on the mainland

527
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,077
to pay for your tuition.

528
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,204
And what did you do for me in return?

529
00:37:28,913 --> 00:37:30,206
Our farm?

530
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,625
The bank owns most of it.

531
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,795
You can't even afford to take care of Mom.

532
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:38,965
Just tell your daughter and wife
to come back from the US.

533
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:41,384
Don't go around asking for money.

534
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,031
You live across from my coffee shop.

535
00:38:06,909 --> 00:38:08,369
Which floor and unit?

536
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:13,624
Are you too drunk to walk?

537
00:38:14,125 --> 00:38:15,459
Do you need my help?

538
00:38:16,627 --> 00:38:19,422
Eun-hui, where are you headed?

539
00:38:21,674 --> 00:38:23,676
Tomorrow's Saturday. I have no work.

540
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:27,513
Gosh, it must be great
to have the weekends off.

541
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,726
I need to go to the auction house soon.

542
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:32,643
Get out.

543
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,105
Then can I

544
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:39,108
come with you to the auction house?

545
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:43,863
No one's home anyway.

546
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:47,033
And I don't think I can sleep.

547
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,119
Suit yourself then.

548
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:05,593
Sold.

549
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,770
Show your numbers.

550
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,777
It's nice and fresh.

551
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,237
All right.

552
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:37,708
They're really fresh. Come check them out.

553
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:38,793
All right.

554
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,925
All right. 38,000 won.

555
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:49,887
All right. They just came in.

556
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,056
Show me your numbers. Okay, sold!

557
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,687
Gather around.

558
00:39:58,771 --> 00:40:02,566
All right. Check them out.

559
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,450
Is that your boyfriend?

560
00:40:11,534 --> 00:40:14,078
Jeez. He's my husband, okay?

561
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:15,996
Unbelievable.

562
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:22,586
Jeju natives are always so nosy.

563
00:40:22,670 --> 00:40:24,672
They have so many questions.

564
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,507
I'm so sick of it.

565
00:40:27,049 --> 00:40:28,467
That's Jeju for you.

566
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:30,803
Where to next?

567
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,097
You know Jeong-jun's brother,
Gi-jun, right?

568
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,141
Let me hand over some goods to him.

569
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,434
Let's eat together.

570
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:39,019
Ms. Jung, how much did you buy today?

571
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,814
Not much at all. Only 8,000.

572
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,193
-How about you?
-Nine thousand.

573
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,988
Gosh, this isn't good.

574
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:02,084
Eun-hui!

575
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:08,466
Back in the day,
we wouldn't hesitate to skip school

576
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:11,385
and go to the beach in our uniform.

577
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:17,224
We'd jump into the sea
even at the break of dawn.

578
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,101
Do you remember?

579
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:37,578
Let's push her in!

580
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,205
Go!

581
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:42,958
Stop it!

582
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,669
-The waves are coming!
-Run!

583
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,099
Eun-hui, what was I like

584
00:42:00,392 --> 00:42:01,936
back then?

585
00:42:03,687 --> 00:42:06,148
You were tough when you got angry.

586
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,692
But your smile

587
00:42:09,485 --> 00:42:11,153
was warm and radiant.

588
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,448
You were young

589
00:42:15,241 --> 00:42:16,659
and full of spirit.

590
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:20,579
We were all like that.

591
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,500
Right?

592
00:42:27,169 --> 00:42:29,338
At times, I hated…

593
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,592
being poor.

594
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:38,847
But back then,

595
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:42,810
I used to laugh a lot
when I was with you guys.

596
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:47,731
I wasn't lame…

597
00:42:50,317 --> 00:42:52,528
or exhausted with life like I am now.

598
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:55,948
Right?

599
00:42:56,907 --> 00:42:57,992
Hey.

600
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,453
You're not like that at all.

601
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,290
You're still just as great.

602
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:08,794
Gosh. I'm all wet.

603
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:10,963
-Hurry up.
-All right.

604
00:43:13,966 --> 00:43:15,134
Gosh, it's so cold.

605
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,144
Let's go in.

606
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,980
-Go get it.
-I'm about to go in.

607
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,106
Just go in.

608
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,899
Come on.

609
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,862
Hey, move over. I'll go in.

610
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:35,988
-What?
-What?

611
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,450
-Hey!
-Hey!

612
00:43:39,533 --> 00:43:40,618
Hey!

613
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:52,087
-Hey!
-Hey!

614
00:43:52,838 --> 00:43:54,006
Look at him.

615
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:56,008
Watch out!

616
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,261
Hey, Han-su! Be careful!

617
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,099
-Hey!
-Get back here.

618
00:44:05,768 --> 00:44:06,810
Hey!

619
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,354
Hey!

620
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,814
Come join me!

621
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,444
-Hey!
-Come join me!

622
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,406
Come on in!

623
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,908
Hurry up. Come on in!

624
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,626
Hey!

625
00:44:30,709 --> 00:44:32,753
-Come out!
-What are you doing?

626
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,014
Hey! What's he doing?

627
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,353
Hey, Han-su! You're old now!

628
00:44:50,145 --> 00:44:53,232
You'll catch a cold!

629
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,818
Unbelievable.

630
00:45:18,340 --> 00:45:21,301
Gosh, he's still so young.

631
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:23,011
I couldn't even dare to.

632
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,014
I envy you!

633
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,019
Eun-hui.

634
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,273
What?

635
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,028
Can I borrow some money…

636
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:46,034
Han-su! Come out now!

637
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,169
Eun-hui!

638
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,088
What did you say?

639
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,385
Let's…

640
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,679
go on a trip.

641
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,186
Let's go to Mokpo
like we did on our field trip.

642
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:13,979
What's he saying?

643
00:46:14,563 --> 00:46:15,898
What did you say?

644
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,108
Mokpo?

645
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,111
If it's just us two, then I'll go!

646
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:23,822
Without those two chatterboxes,
In-gwon and Ho-sik!

647
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,536
Okay!

648
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:43,091
Jeez. Look at him joking around.

649
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:02,819
MI-JIN

650
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:05,072
MISSED CALL
MI-JIN

651
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,957
BO-RAM

652
00:47:20,754 --> 00:47:21,713
Dad.

653
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,633
I want to stop playing golf.

654
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:35,352
Why do you want to give up? Tell me.

655
00:47:35,936 --> 00:47:39,064
You've been at it for 13 years.
What will you do now?

656
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:43,944
When I told you to give up golfing,
you said you'd rather die.

657
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:45,696
You cried and refused to eat.

658
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:48,240
You said golf meant everything to you.

659
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,909
So why would you suddenly give up now?

660
00:47:55,747 --> 00:47:57,708
How can I play golf when I have no money?

661
00:47:57,791 --> 00:47:59,543
Who told you to worry about money?

662
00:48:00,335 --> 00:48:02,296
Did I ever ask you to earn money?

663
00:48:02,838 --> 00:48:05,424
I'll find a way to pay for everything.

664
00:48:05,507 --> 00:48:06,925
Let me talk to him.

665
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:11,471
Both she and I have given up.

666
00:48:12,097 --> 00:48:13,682
Now, it's your turn.

667
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:18,770
I refuse to stay here
and end up being dirt-poor.

668
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,195
I'll call you back.

669
00:49:15,952 --> 00:49:16,787
Hey.

670
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,872
Sorry, I was taking a shower.

671
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,207
You haven't eaten, right?

672
00:49:21,708 --> 00:49:23,001
Let me. Come in.

673
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:24,044
I'll take that.

674
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,921
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

675
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:27,464
Not at all.

676
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,759
It's roomier than I thought.

677
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,811
Gosh, that's hot.

678
00:49:46,066 --> 00:49:48,443
You must be a good cook.

679
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,112
Not really.

680
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:52,656
My neighbors made them.

681
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:54,866
Eat up. I brought loads.

682
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,411
I'm not a good cook.

683
00:49:57,494 --> 00:49:59,496
I only know how to behead fish.

684
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:03,250
The stew tastes nice.

685
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:05,669
Sit down.

686
00:50:09,548 --> 00:50:10,924
Try some.

687
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,344
-This is my spoon.
-Okay.

688
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,060
Yes. It's good.

689
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:43,623
I haven't eaten like this in a while.

690
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:47,419
It's like having homemade food.
It's tasty.

691
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:49,087
It's nice and filling.

692
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:52,549
Hey, have some more rice.

693
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:54,009
Okay.

694
00:50:56,678 --> 00:50:58,180
What happened to your finger?

695
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,056
Oh, this?

696
00:51:00,807 --> 00:51:03,435
I was slicing frozen pollack today.

697
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:05,771
Then I wondered
if you had eaten yet and cut myself.

698
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:12,110
-Eat up.
-Okay.

699
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,868
Eun-hui, come sit down.

700
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:23,288
Your bandage is all wet.
Let me give you a new one.

701
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:26,291
No, it's okay. Don't bother.

702
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:30,420
-Come here and sit down.
-Gosh.

703
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,964
-Sit down.
-It's really okay.

704
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,342
Goodness.

705
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:45,811
Let me see.

706
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:48,313
Goodness.

707
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:52,943
Gosh.

708
00:51:55,028 --> 00:51:56,738
Poor you.

709
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:16,258
You have so many cuts on your hand.

710
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:22,055
It comes with the business.

711
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:25,976
I get cut filleting fish all the time.

712
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:29,855
How many fish do you sell a day?

713
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:32,774
I can't count all of them. A lot.

714
00:52:33,358 --> 00:52:35,151
On a good day, hundreds.

715
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:39,698
Your arms must hurt
if you chop fish all day.

716
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:42,325
Of course. My shoulders and wrists
are all worn-out.

717
00:52:42,993 --> 00:52:44,703
They just don't show.

718
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:48,456
You work so hard.

719
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:52,836
You sent your siblings to college
and married them off.

720
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,171
You also bought them houses.

721
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,924
I admire you.

722
00:52:58,008 --> 00:53:02,554
All I'll do in this life is
take care of my family and die.

723
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:05,307
Gosh.

724
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,977
The bandage is on nice and tight.

725
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:10,854
-What?
-Thanks.

726
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:16,651
Hey, what happened to your toe?

727
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,278
It's bleeding.

728
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,865
It's not a big deal. My toenail fell off.

729
00:53:21,948 --> 00:53:24,868
-I'll do it for you.
-No, I can do it.

730
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,329
Come on. Let me return the favor.

731
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:30,123
-But…
-Don't be embarrassed. We're friends.

732
00:53:30,999 --> 00:53:32,375
-Let me see.
-Right.

733
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,628
Goodness.

734
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:39,758
This looks bad.

735
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,469
It must have hurt a lot.

736
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,763
What happened?

737
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:47,557
I bumped it on a desk.

738
00:53:47,641 --> 00:53:49,100
Goodness.

739
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:53,104
Hold on.

740
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:55,857
Does it hurt?

741
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,946
It's going to hurt.

742
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:04,115
Aren't you and your wife

743
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:07,410
living apart for too long?

744
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:12,207
Your daughter is all grown up now.

745
00:54:12,958 --> 00:54:15,001
Shouldn't your wife come back?

746
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:20,966
We've…

747
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,677
separated.

748
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:31,977
Since when?

749
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,819
Since Bo-ram went abroad.

750
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,906
Has it been that long?

751
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,327
It's not good to live apart for so long.

752
00:54:51,413 --> 00:54:53,498
Are you getting a divorce?

753
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:01,631
I am.

754
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:09,806
This coffee isn't that good.

755
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:13,768
We should have bought some
from my coffee shop. It's tastier.

756
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:19,065
Let's go to Mokpo.

757
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:23,528
Hey, you're still married

758
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,072
even though you're living apart.

759
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:30,076
I was joking when I agreed to go earlier.
It's just wrong.

760
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,873
Are you only saying that
because you don't see me as a woman?

761
00:55:35,457 --> 00:55:38,001
No, I do see you as one.

762
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:43,048
You're cute, admirable,

763
00:55:44,632 --> 00:55:45,800
and confident.

764
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,553
Gosh, stop it.

765
00:55:50,555 --> 00:55:53,975
Goodness. You probably remember many girls

766
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,227
since you were popular.

767
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,397
But you're the only guy I ever liked,
so I want to cherish that.

768
00:56:00,482 --> 00:56:03,151
What would you do if I suddenly kissed you

769
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:06,154
like I did during our field trip to Mokpo?

770
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,451
That was

771
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:15,163
the first time I ever kissed a guy.

772
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,791
Those were good times.

773
00:56:22,587 --> 00:56:24,005
If you're not going,

774
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,341
I'll go alone.

775
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:29,052
Do you want more coffee?

776
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:34,516
Are you really going to go alone?

777
00:57:28,736 --> 00:57:31,030
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

778
00:57:33,950 --> 00:57:36,411
-You were waiting outside?
-Yes.

779
00:57:36,494 --> 00:57:37,579
Goodness.

780
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,831
Hop in.

781
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:57,891
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

782
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:02,270
If my children were still alive,

783
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,856
I wouldn't have had
to put you through this.

784
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:07,734
Oh, please.
You should let them go already.

785
00:58:08,818 --> 00:58:11,446
Next time we go to the market,

786
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:14,115
don't come out so early in the morning.

787
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,201
In-gwon, Ho-sik, and I will--

788
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:19,871
Gosh, you're so impatient.

789
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:22,290
What a kind girl.

790
00:58:23,166 --> 00:58:24,417
She is.

791
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,818
Here you go. Enjoy.

792
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:54,572
ABANG SUNDAE

793
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:59,327
-Two servings of soup. For delivery.
-Hey.

794
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:01,162
Shouldn't you be busy?

795
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,997
It's not for me.

796
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,874
It's for Ms. Hyeon and Ms. Kang.

797
00:59:06,084 --> 00:59:09,212
Hey, how could you charge them
for the food?

798
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:12,006
Jeez, you're so impudent.

799
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,057
-Make way for the fish.
-What?

800
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,433
Make way.

801
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:24,102
Watch out.

802
00:59:24,185 --> 00:59:26,271
Coming through.

803
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,857
Make way for the fish.

804
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,485
Move aside. Here comes the fish.

805
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:36,072
Make way for the fish.

806
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:38,449
Goodness. Move aside.

807
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:40,493
Make way for the fish.

808
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:42,912
-Goodness.
-Here.

809
00:59:43,746 --> 00:59:45,415
I'll take them.

810
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,293
We have fresh hairtail caught today!

811
00:59:48,376 --> 00:59:51,087
-How much is it?
-It's 10,000 won.

812
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,589
What would you like?

813
00:59:53,631 --> 00:59:55,049
-The mackerel?
-Yes.

814
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:56,426
Thank you.

815
00:59:57,010 --> 00:59:58,344
It's over there.

816
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,346
You need to get more mackerel tomorrow.

817
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,472
Okay.

818
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,308
-We don't have enough fish.
-Okay.

819
01:00:03,391 --> 01:00:05,101
-Goodness.
-Come take a look.

820
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,395
-Come take a look.
-We have hairtail.

821
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,661
I don't usually sell them like this.

822
01:00:23,745 --> 01:00:25,413
I'd like four of them.

823
01:00:25,496 --> 01:00:27,040
We have fresh fish.

824
01:00:27,123 --> 01:00:29,083
-Fresh hairtail and tilefish.
-And cuttlefish.

825
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,003
Four cups of number one,
our signature coffee.

826
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,674
One cup of number two, black coffee.

827
01:00:53,399 --> 01:00:56,110
Hey, did you say hi to your mom?

828
01:00:57,403 --> 01:00:58,571
Hey.

829
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:05,203
-Hey.
-Goodness.

830
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,373
Here you go. Enjoy.

831
01:01:08,456 --> 01:01:11,209
Come on. Don't bother.

832
01:01:11,292 --> 01:01:13,586
I don't need your money. Goodbye.

833
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:15,338
Jeez, that boy.

834
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,342
All right.

835
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,146
Dong-seok is here.

836
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:34,107
Just eat.

837
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:36,943
Hello.

838
01:01:37,568 --> 01:01:39,487
They're all from here.

839
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:41,114
I grew them myself.

840
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,032
Two bundles of spinach, please.

841
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:46,452
-How much is that?
-Eight thousand won.

842
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:50,832
-Thank you.
-Hope you sell a lot.

843
01:01:50,915 --> 01:01:51,916
Thank you.

844
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,835
We have bracken and sweet potatoes.

845
01:01:53,918 --> 01:01:56,129
We have bracken and sweet potatoes.

846
01:01:56,212 --> 01:01:59,048
-Come and take a look.
-Come and take a look.

847
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,342
Pick whatever you want!

848
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:02,760
ELASTIC PANTS
TWO THOUSAND WON

849
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,928
How much is this?

850
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,767
That'll be 10,000 won.

851
01:02:09,851 --> 01:02:10,768
Here.

852
01:02:15,690 --> 01:02:18,401
Pick whatever you want!

853
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:21,362
Fresh hairtail, mackerel,

854
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,156
-cuttlefish.
-This is for you.

855
01:02:23,781 --> 01:02:24,907
Come take a look.

856
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:29,328
Is it 5,000 won for three?

857
01:02:29,412 --> 01:02:30,997
Hey, ma'am.

858
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:32,707
An order for hairtail. Quickly.

859
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:35,376
All right. I'll have it
ready for you in a jiffy.

860
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:39,088
Hey, I remember how you fainted at school.

861
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:42,675
It was adorable.

862
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:46,929
It was so cute.

863
01:02:49,557 --> 01:02:51,434
We've separated.

864
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,366
MYEONG-BO TOLD ME
THAT YOU MOVED TO JEJU ISLAND

865
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:08,618
SURE

866
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:18,711
We have fresh hairtail caught today!

867
01:03:27,011 --> 01:03:29,138
Sure, let's go to Mokpo.

868
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,808
We can go on a trip together as friends.

869
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:40,608
Hey, did you get any new customers?

870
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,860
I just said hello.

871
01:03:42,944 --> 01:03:44,695
-Let's have lunch.
-Okay.

872
01:03:45,363 --> 01:03:46,447
Eun-hui withdrew

873
01:03:46,531 --> 01:03:50,451
ninety million won from another bank
and deposited it in ours.

874
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:53,621
She wanted you to take credit.

875
01:03:54,413 --> 01:03:57,416
She seems to care for you a lot.

876
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:05,174
It's great to be back in Jeju.

877
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:07,885
I get to see my friends.

878
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:26,320
Hey, Hyeong-sik. How are you doing?

879
01:04:27,029 --> 01:04:29,699
Are you still making
good money through stocks?

880
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:32,201
I see.

881
01:04:33,369 --> 01:04:36,747
By the way, I have a question.

882
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:38,583
Yes.

883
01:04:39,166 --> 01:04:43,671
Have you been in touch with Han-su lately?

884
01:04:46,465 --> 01:04:47,592
I see.

885
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,720
You guys talked before he came to Jeju?

886
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,766
It's a little awkward to ask.

887
01:04:56,309 --> 01:04:57,560
But does Han-su

888
01:04:58,477 --> 01:04:59,770
need money?

889
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:04,442
No, he didn't ask me for any.

890
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:07,695
What is it?

891
01:05:09,697 --> 01:05:12,366
Did he ask you for money?

892
01:05:21,375 --> 01:05:25,880
INCOMING VIDEO CALL
MI-JIN

893
01:06:05,169 --> 01:06:07,672
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

894
01:06:32,905 --> 01:06:35,616
Hey. You're here.

895
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,245
-Your seatbelt.
-Right.

896
01:06:44,291 --> 01:06:45,793
-Let's go.
-Okay.

897
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,104
-Look at that.
-I know.

898
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:07,398
Gosh.

899
01:07:09,275 --> 01:07:10,901
It's nice to be out at sea.

900
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,785
Goodness.

901
01:07:23,497 --> 01:07:24,498
Here.

902
01:07:25,082 --> 01:07:26,667
-No, it's okay.
-Here.

903
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:29,211
-Sit down.
-I'm really fine.

904
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:30,337
Sit.

905
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:34,550
Hey.

906
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:37,970
Aren't you cold?

907
01:07:38,054 --> 01:07:39,472
No, I'm fine.

908
01:07:42,475 --> 01:07:44,060
I'm glad we came.

909
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,859
By the way, have you ever
gone back to Mokpo

910
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:53,944
since our field trip?

911
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:59,325
The company training center is there,
so I've been there a few times.

912
01:08:00,785 --> 01:08:03,287
I haven't been there ever since.

913
01:08:05,706 --> 01:08:08,167
I was too busy making a living.

914
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:09,960
And I thought going back

915
01:08:10,795 --> 01:08:13,464
would make me sad
and pine for the good old days.

916
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,550
Why?

917
01:08:17,343 --> 01:08:18,677
Why would you be sad?

918
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,265
Those days…

919
01:08:25,267 --> 01:08:26,811
were the best days

920
01:08:27,603 --> 01:08:29,688
of my youth.

921
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:35,486
My mom passed away
soon after I returned from the field trip.

922
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:39,532
She suffered heatstroke
while doing farm work.

923
01:08:41,951 --> 01:08:43,119
I see.

924
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:47,498
That's why I dropped out of school

925
01:08:47,581 --> 01:08:49,750
and started selling fish.

926
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:56,882
I'm still sad that
I never got to graduate with you guys.

927
01:08:57,716 --> 01:09:00,219
But you took the GED later.

928
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,471
But still…

929
01:09:04,431 --> 01:09:06,559
Since I dropped out,

930
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:09,436
I don't deserve to attend the reunions.

931
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:13,107
But they were
always kind enough to invite me.

932
01:09:22,616 --> 01:09:24,243
You grew up to be so strong.

933
01:09:26,579 --> 01:09:27,830
Thank you,

934
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:30,457
my friend.

935
01:09:31,584 --> 01:09:33,335
I should be the one thanking you…

936
01:09:35,421 --> 01:09:37,214
for still being so charming.

937
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:42,970
Had you returned in a mess,

938
01:09:43,053 --> 01:09:45,472
it would have broken my heart.

939
01:09:46,265 --> 01:09:50,269
Because it would have tainted
my memories of when I was young.

940
01:09:51,395 --> 01:09:53,397
Thank you for growing up so well

941
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,818
and allowing me to preserve
the radiant memories of my youth.

942
01:09:58,861 --> 01:09:59,820
Thank you.

943
01:10:01,488 --> 01:10:02,573
Thanks.

944
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:15,377
Right. This is my favorite song.

945
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:18,505
Let's listen to it together.

946
01:10:21,884 --> 01:10:22,968
Here.

947
01:11:19,316 --> 01:11:21,402
Why did you come over to my house?

948
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:23,112
Just because.

949
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,450
We were adorable back then, weren't we?

950
01:11:29,702 --> 01:11:30,786
We were.

951
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:35,958
One, two, three.

952
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:38,043
Why would you go to Mokpo
with a married guy?

953
01:11:40,379 --> 01:11:41,463
Just one room?

954
01:11:42,089 --> 01:11:43,757
Do you know that he's lying?

955
01:11:46,260 --> 01:11:47,678
She doesn't like you.

956
01:11:47,761 --> 01:11:50,347
-Hey!
-You'll get your heart broken.

957
01:11:51,015 --> 01:11:52,433
Watch out.

958
01:11:53,183 --> 01:11:54,226
Eun-hui.

959
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:59,315
