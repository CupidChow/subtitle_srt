00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,862
DONG-SEOK AND SEON-A

2
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,613
PAST WOUNDS ON AN UNEXPECTED ROAD,
YOUR WARMTH IN AN ARCADE ON A RAINY DAY

3
00:01:19,788 --> 00:01:20,789
Yeong-ju.

4
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:22,624
Let's just have the baby.

5
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:26,753
Are you ready to raise it?

6
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,546
No.

7
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,885
But I just can't say…

8
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:38,014
goodbye to it.

9
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,477
The baby's heartbeat
keeps ringing in my ears.

10
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:45,396
Just ignore it.

11
00:01:53,738 --> 00:01:54,948
Let's have it.

12
00:01:56,241 --> 00:01:59,452
Perhaps, we could be good parents.

13
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:00,829
Don't be ridiculous.

14
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:01,996
You're nuts.

15
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,790
You've ruined my--

16
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,969
HAESOL PARK

17
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:18,972
BANG YEONG-JU

18
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:35,822
I'm going to take
the number 200 bus and come back.

19
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,824
I'm going to get an abortion.

20
00:02:41,119 --> 00:02:42,704
And once I go to Seoul,

21
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,207
I'm never going to see you again.

22
00:03:12,483 --> 00:03:15,194
SHINJEJU TO PUREUNG ENTRANCE

23
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:44,849
Sir, what was that?

24
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:46,768
Sir, I heard something explode.

25
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:48,561
Sir, there's smoke.

26
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:50,772
Sir, there's something wrong
with your bus.

27
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,774
-What's going on?
-There's smoke.

28
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:54,234
Everything was fine.

29
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,194
What's going on?

30
00:03:56,277 --> 00:03:58,154
There's smoke.

31
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:02,575
-Sir, please stop the bus!
-Stop the bus.

32
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,869
I can't pull over right now! Please wait!

33
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,205
There's a lot of smoke.

34
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,666
The fire extinguisher exploded
due to the impact.

35
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:10,917
Don't panic.

36
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,086
-Yeong-ju.
-It's okay!

37
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:14,837
Goodness, that scared me.

38
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:16,798
Sir, please stop the bus!

39
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:19,092
-How did that explode?
-Please stop the bus!

40
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:23,137
-There's too much smoke.
-Please stop the bus, sir!

41
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,098
Be patient. He said he'll pull over soon.

42
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,642
-Can you please pull over?
-What's wrong? It scared me.

43
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,935
I'm pregnant!

44
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,272
She's pregnant, and I'm the father!

45
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,564
Please pull over!

46
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:37,777
She's pregnant, and I'm the father!
Please pull over!

47
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,612
She's pregnant. Pull over.

48
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:41,698
She says she's pregnant.

49
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,826
-Sir, please pull over.
-Hang on!

50
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:57,630
See? It exploded due to the impact.

51
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,008
Are you not getting back on?

52
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:04,178
Jeez.

53
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,562
No way.

54
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,536
How will we tell our dads?

55
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:32,999
Your dad's strong, right?

56
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:35,168
Probably.

57
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:38,212
Make sure he doesn't kill you.

58
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,881
Okay.

59
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,140
The friend I told you about
is living happily even after an abortion.

60
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,936
You can give birth and be happy too.

61
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,190
I bet her boyfriend wasn't like me.

62
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,277
You have me.

63
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,655
Promise you won't change.

64
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,952
I'm going to trust you and have our baby.

65
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,045
Hey, you put your shoes on backwards.

66
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,844
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

67
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,356
Goodness.

68
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,693
Look at them kissing
in the middle of the road.

69
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:24,861
Oh, dear.

70
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,404
Are they insane?

71
00:07:27,113 --> 00:07:28,781
My goodness.

72
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:31,117
Their dads will have a fit
if they find out.

73
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:36,873
No way. The OB-GYN.

74
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:41,752
It can't be.

75
00:07:42,253 --> 00:07:44,672
There's no way those kids could've…

76
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,674
That can't be.

77
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:52,054
Jeez.

78
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:12,909
DONG-SEOK AND SEON-A 1

79
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:30,510
HAEBYEOL PRESCHOOL

80
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:36,766
-Careful.
-Watch the stairs.

81
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,808
Ji-won!

82
00:08:37,892 --> 00:08:39,519
-Min-seok.
-Mom!

83
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,770
-Mom.
-Be careful.

84
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:43,397
-Goodbye.
-Mom.

85
00:08:44,148 --> 00:08:46,526
-Yeol!
-Mom!

86
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,156
Did you have fun?

87
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,493
-Even the puppies are singing
-Even the puppies are singing

88
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,913
-Let's sing together like the cats
-Let's sing together like the cats

89
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,458
Gather around and sing together

90
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,336
Gather around, my animal friends

91
00:09:05,419 --> 00:09:06,963
Let's sing together

92
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:09,549
Even the parrots are singing

93
00:09:09,632 --> 00:09:12,843
Let's sing together like the rabbits

94
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:16,430
Gather around and sing together

95
00:09:16,514 --> 00:09:19,225
-Everybody, gather around
-Everybody, gather around

96
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,268
Yes?

97
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,396
Coming.

98
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,907
This is Yeol's room.

99
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,242
Gosh, it's so pretty.

100
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,580
You've decorated his room very well.

101
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:16,509
I didn't want him
to forget his dad's face,

102
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:18,636
so I left his photo there.

103
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,431
The divorce must have gone smoothly.

104
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:24,266
It did.

105
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:28,396
How long has it been?

106
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:31,607
It's been about six months
since we divorced.

107
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,443
And it's been two months

108
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,155
since Yeol has lived
with his dad after the car accident.

109
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:41,826
But the room feels warm and looks tidy

110
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:43,994
as if he's been staying here all along.

111
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,663
May I take some photos?

112
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:52,628
He could come home any time,
so I want to be prepared.

113
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:58,050
You must have expected him
to come here after you were discharged.

114
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:03,431
The custody battle
must have blindsided you.

115
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:17,445
Would you like some tea, ma'am?

116
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,196
Sure.

117
00:12:28,622 --> 00:12:31,208
Have you met Yeol and his dad already?

118
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:32,460
Yes, I have.

119
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,720
Yeol likes flowers.

120
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:44,430
I see.

121
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:48,142
You see,

122
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,353
as a Child and Family Investigator,

123
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:55,733
it's my job to help you reach
an amicable agreement

124
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,486
before the judge gives the ruling

125
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:00,988
on this child custody suit.

126
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,200
I'm well aware that your opinion

127
00:13:05,034 --> 00:13:08,704
weighs heavily on the judge's decision.

128
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:11,040
Ms. Min.

129
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,293
Please understand

130
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:20,883
that I must ask you a few
personal questions as an investigator.

131
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:25,763
You're aware that your ex-husband
wants custody of your son.

132
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,934
May I ask the reason for your divorce?

133
00:13:30,017 --> 00:13:31,393
A clash in personalities.

134
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:35,439
Your ex-husband gave a different answer.

135
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,316
More than the depression itself,

136
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:40,528
it troubled me that she showed
no desire to overcome it.

137
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,199
During our seven years of marriage,
she had neglected our son

138
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:47,618
due to her illness.

139
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:56,627
There's no way he can tell
if I want to overcome this illness or not.

140
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,673
Like all patients
who suffer from depression,

141
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,175
I want to get better.

142
00:14:04,593 --> 00:14:06,637
That's why the judge

143
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,390
gave me custody of our son
during our divorce.

144
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:11,976
I'd like to ask him this question.

145
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,896
If he truly felt like
I had neglected Yeol,

146
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,191
then why didn't he file
a child custody suit during our divorce?

147
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,526
It was my mistake.

148
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:23,237
I believed it was better
for our son to live with his mother.

149
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,906
I had no idea
she'd get into a car accident.

150
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:29,493
I know she claims
that she wants to get better.

151
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:32,162
But I disagree.

152
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,498
I doubt she took
her medication on that day either.

153
00:14:34,582 --> 00:14:38,168
That accident occurred
because I took my medication.

154
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,881
I had been prescribed a new medication,
but my body couldn't adjust to it.

155
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,424
I can prove it

156
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:45,384
with my medical records.

157
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:47,344
Had she taken new medication,

158
00:14:48,262 --> 00:14:49,471
she shouldn't have driven.

159
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:55,853
Your ex-husband provided us

160
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:59,607
with home surveillance footage
from the past.

161
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:03,986
Could you please explain

162
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,031
why Yeol was alone here?

163
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:26,592
According to your ex-husband,

164
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:28,677
you were sleeping in your room.

165
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,222
He said this happened more than once.

166
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,562
About once or twice every month.

167
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:42,900
Only when my symptoms worsened.

168
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:45,361
On the other days,

169
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,657
we'd play, eat, and sleep together.

170
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:52,076
I have footage as proof.

171
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,786
I'll hand it in.

172
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,206
Okay.

173
00:15:58,582 --> 00:16:01,752
Is there an object Yeol is attached to?

174
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:12,179
-Yes.
-What is it?

175
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:15,516
-A toy tractor.
-He likes his toy tractor.

176
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,268
But I think he likes

177
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:21,814
the yellow pony cup
that I bought him more.

178
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,151
He'd take it to his preschool.

179
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:29,947
He had it in his backpack
on the day of the accident as well.

180
00:16:31,198 --> 00:16:33,867
He went straight to his dad's
after leaving the hospital.

181
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:37,413
My ex-husband should have it in his home.

182
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,915
I had asked Yeol
what his favorite object was.

183
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:42,584
And he said it was

184
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,254
that yellow cup over there.

185
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,723
What does he dislike the most?

186
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:57,975
Sleeping in the dark.

187
00:16:58,058 --> 00:16:59,268
Sleeping in the dark.

188
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,521
I see.

189
00:17:04,148 --> 00:17:05,774
I'll cut to the chase.

190
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:09,862
Why must you be

191
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,406
the one to raise him?

192
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:18,579
Yeol is always exposed to danger
since his mom is unstable.

193
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:22,291
-I just can't go to work in peace.
-Well…

194
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:26,378
It sounds like
you're prioritizing work over your son.

195
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,673
Should I just jot down what you said?

196
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,551
This could affect the ruling.

197
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,472
She's jobless.

198
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,140
I'm planning to find a job.

199
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,309
She's been jobless for seven years now.

200
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:42,519
It won't be easy to find a new job.

201
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:46,815
If you get custody of Yeol
and find a new job,

202
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,652
who will take care of him?

203
00:17:54,364 --> 00:17:57,242
I'd have to send him to a daycare center.

204
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:01,663
But if I move to a smaller house

205
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:04,208
and get a part-time job,

206
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,127
I'll be home more often.

207
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,755
She has a mother who has remarried,

208
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,717
and her husband is currently ill,
so she can't help out.

209
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:16,386
But my parents are healthy
and will be around the house.

210
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,890
Does that mean they'll be
primarily in charge

211
00:18:19,973 --> 00:18:22,351
of raising Yeol, not you?

212
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,618
This is the best environment
for Yeol to grow up in.

213
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,954
This is the last question.

214
00:18:43,163 --> 00:18:45,165
Why must you be

215
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:49,253
the one to raise him?

216
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:53,924
That's because…

217
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,972
I can't live without him.

218
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,726
I need him to live.

219
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,943
Let me ask you again.

220
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:18,657
I fully understand
how much he means to you.

221
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:24,037
But between his mother and his father,

222
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:26,957
whom should Yeol live with?

223
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:28,959
Me.

224
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,797
Me.

225
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,636
I asked Yeol

226
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:44,349
how he felt about his parents.

227
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,518
Would you like to see it?

228
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:52,900
Did the dinosaur enter
this village full of people?

229
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,193
Yes.

230
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,282
Yeol, how do you feel
when you think about your dad?

231
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,534
-I feel happy.
-Do you?

232
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:05,204
What is your dad to you?

233
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:08,665
-A friend.
-I see.

234
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:10,918
He's like a friend to you.

235
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,170
Then what about your mom?

236
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,047
She's…

237
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:24,056
LET'S SING TOGETHER

238
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:43,325
MOKPO BONGAM MARKET

239
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:36,712
The market isn't even open,
Mr. Early Bird.

240
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,047
Twenty hooks.

241
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:41,300
Twenty hand plows.

242
00:21:41,383 --> 00:21:44,177
And five sickles.

243
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,847
-These are new.
-Those are expensive.

244
00:21:46,930 --> 00:21:49,850
The elderly islanders can't afford that.
They're way too pricey.

245
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:55,731
Who says they can't use
good-quality tools?

246
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,690
How much are they?

247
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,150
They're 25,000 won a piece.

248
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:15,500
Came to buy goods?

249
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,502
Everything is so expensive now.

250
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,463
I can't do this anymore.

251
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:21,548
Oh, stop whining.

252
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,803
She's…

253
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:45,423
Will his answer affect the ruling?

254
00:23:52,472 --> 00:23:53,640
Probably.

255
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,187
When it comes to custody trials,
the judge will prioritize

256
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,315
the kid's relationship with his parents.

257
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,194
I'm at a disadvantage, right?

258
00:24:08,822 --> 00:24:11,908
I'll give you a call
once the court date is set.

259
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:16,955
Ma'am, please get out.
You can't stay in there.

260
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:09,216
Ten screwdrivers.

261
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,471
Two boxes of concrete nails.

262
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,432
Three boxes

263
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:19,893
of hardwood nails.

264
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,104
And…

265
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,649
Let's see…

266
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,861
Damn it.

267
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,600
Damn it.

268
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:26,918
One soy milk.

269
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:55,780
A hundred pairs of elastic pants.

270
00:26:58,491 --> 00:26:59,909
And…

271
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,971
This ship has arrived in Port of Jeju,
its final destination.

272
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:23,516
This ship has arrived in Port of Jeju,
its final destination.

273
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,312
Please make sure you have
all your belongings before leaving.

274
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,815
Enjoy your trip. Thank you.

275
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,150
Jeez.

276
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,391
Hello?

277
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,229
Your call is currently in queue.

278
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:52,147
Please--

279
00:29:33,813 --> 00:29:35,982
Why were you standing
in the middle of the road?

280
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,080
I think it's out of battery.

281
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,841
Please help me.

282
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,135
I don't want to.

283
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,304
Then can I use your phone?

284
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,139
Mine's out of battery.

285
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:17,774
Don't you recognize me?

286
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,070
I do.

287
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,780
Do you?

288
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,282
Then isn't it common courtesy to greet me

289
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,117
and ask how I've been doing?

290
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,569
Turn the engine on.

291
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:26,486
You do know

292
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,155
that you shouldn't stop
the car midway, right?

293
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,157
I do.

294
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:34,243
There's a gas station
about 2 to 3km from here.

295
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:35,703
Recharge your battery there.

296
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,831
Thanks.

297
00:33:06,359 --> 00:33:08,236
You must have drunk a lot, ma'am.

298
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:16,828
If you ever need a chauffeur,

299
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:18,913
call this number.

300
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:22,792
If you ask them for me,

301
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,253
I'll give you a discount.

302
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:27,505
My name is Lee Dong-seok.

303
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,009
Okay.

304
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,684
TAE-HUN

305
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:46,232
You must work near Gangnam Station.

306
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,484
Can I ask what you do for a living?

307
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:54,157
Do you live
in Hapjeong-dong where we're headed?

308
00:33:58,536 --> 00:33:59,996
Are you married?

309
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,957
You seem to be around
a good age to get married.

310
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:09,589
I'm from Jeju.

311
00:34:10,339 --> 00:34:11,424
I moved to Seoul…

312
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:15,511
in 12th grade due to personal reasons.

313
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,139
Have you been to Jeju before?

314
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,434
No?

315
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,898
Hi, Dong-seok.

316
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:29,650
It's been a long time.

317
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,115
So you do remember me.

318
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:00,473
PUREUNG GAS STATION

319
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,534
You're good.

320
00:35:25,456 --> 00:35:27,708
Stephen Chow is the best Hong Kong actor.

321
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:30,211
After Bruce Lee, he's the next best.

322
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:32,922
Have you seen Shaolin Soccer?
Stephen Chow does this.

323
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:35,216
He kicks like this, and…

324
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,094
Have you seen it?

325
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,432
-Can you do that again?
-Was it that funny?

326
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:48,855
Get up. You're embarrassing yourself.

327
00:35:48,938 --> 00:35:51,440
-Get up.
-I can see your underwear.

328
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,860
-Hey.
-What the hell did he say?

329
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,153
-Let's go.
-Damn it.

330
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,737
-You bastard.
-Dong-seok!

331
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:59,490
-Dong-seok!
-Who the hell are you?

332
00:35:59,574 --> 00:36:01,534
-You bastard!
-Stop it!

333
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,497
-You bastard.
-Dong-seok.

334
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:08,249
-Damn it.
-Dong-seok, let's just go.

335
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:09,458
-You want to die?
-Come here.

336
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,252
Let go of me. You little…

337
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:23,097
Beer?

338
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:25,641
Soju.

339
00:36:26,267 --> 00:36:28,644
No, let's each have one beer.

340
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:38,321
Let me have a look at you.

341
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,407
Lean forward.

342
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,252
Do you have a boyfriend?

343
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,254
No.

344
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,506
Then who's that in that photo?

345
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:04,305
He's my ex-boyfriend.

346
00:37:06,641 --> 00:37:08,559
Then why didn't you throw it away?

347
00:37:09,644 --> 00:37:11,520
Because we could get back together.

348
00:37:11,604 --> 00:37:13,189
But you've already broken up.

349
00:37:27,536 --> 00:37:29,121
Should I sleep here tonight?

350
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:32,375
No. I have no spare rooms.

351
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,293
What about the living room?

352
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,924
I miss the Jeju sea.

353
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,592
Then let's go.

354
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:45,972
How can I go to Jeju right now?

355
00:37:46,055 --> 00:37:47,598
I have work tomorrow.

356
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:51,185
We don't have to go to Jeju.
There's the Yellow Sea and the East Sea.

357
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:56,983
My car is at the repair shop.

358
00:37:57,483 --> 00:37:58,693
You don't even have a car.

359
00:37:58,776 --> 00:38:00,069
What if I get a car?

360
00:38:07,034 --> 00:38:08,160
No.

361
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:11,956
What if there's a traffic jam
and I'm late to work tomorrow?

362
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,837
Or will there be none?
Since it's a weekday?

363
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:19,964
I doubt there'd be traffic.

364
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:23,801
-Do you think we can go?
-Hold on.

365
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,979
Hey, Gyu-tae. One minute.

366
00:38:35,062 --> 00:38:36,439
Get ready.

367
00:38:38,524 --> 00:38:40,067
Where are you?

368
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,778
-Hey.
-Are we seriously going?

369
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,823
Okay. Hey, do you have…

370
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:51,579
Come on. Your car isn't beat-up.
You just don't want to lend it to me.

371
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,414
If it works, then it's fine.

372
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,833
Fine. I'll buy you drinks later.

373
00:38:55,916 --> 00:38:56,959
Taxi!

374
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,128
I'll be there soon. I just got a taxi.

375
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,922
Okay. I'll call you again.

376
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:22,276
Hey, you're here.

377
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:32,828
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

378
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,374
Goodness, how impudent.
Your mom's here, you know?

379
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,510
It's so refreshing!

380
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,280
This is wonderful.

381
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,964
Don't talk to me as if I'm your friend.

382
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,758
We're not best buddies
or anything like that.

383
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,552
I'm a man and you're a woman.

384
00:40:29,635 --> 00:40:31,178
Let's be honest.

385
00:40:32,138 --> 00:40:33,681
I know you have feelings for me.

386
00:40:33,764 --> 00:40:36,851
That's why we always hang out
and go clubbing.

387
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,228
And that's why you came
all the way here with me.

388
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:41,564
Aren't I right?

389
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:44,525
Me?

390
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:48,863
You?

391
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,117
I have feelings for you?

392
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:06,547
Why?

393
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,342
Am I not worth having feelings for?

394
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:12,928
Is that it?

395
00:41:14,889 --> 00:41:16,056
Is it?

396
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,187
Because I'm uneducated?

397
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,859
Because I'm poor?

398
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,655
Am I too unsophisticated for you

399
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,283
since I didn't go to university?

400
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:38,037
Is that it?

401
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:41,415
Answer me.

402
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:52,051
Hello, is this the taxi service?

403
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:57,306
I'm on the highway along Yeonsu Beach
and headed toward Seoul.

404
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:58,724
I'd like to call a taxi.

405
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:01,352
Yes.

406
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:11,153
I'm about one kilometer
from the intersection gas station.

407
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:17,826
Unbelievable.

408
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,960
Hey. Fine.

409
00:42:27,002 --> 00:42:29,421
I get it. So get back in.

410
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:33,050
Get in. I won't do anything.

411
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,053
I'm not getting in. Just go.

412
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:41,392
Fine. Do as you please.

413
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,634
Damn it.

414
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,436
Damn it!

415
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,910
Where is it?

416
00:43:43,746 --> 00:43:44,955
Damn it.

417
00:43:53,922 --> 00:43:55,299
Damn it.

418
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:39,510
Seriously? Damn it.

419
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:43,972
Damn it!

420
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:49,728
Why did he lend me such a beat-up car?

421
00:44:50,562 --> 00:44:51,730
Damn it.

422
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,789
Jeez, that's hot.

423
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,504
That little…

424
00:45:16,755 --> 00:45:17,965
She got me again.

425
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:30,185
Damn it!

426
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:13,103
JEJU MIRINAE BED AND BREAKFAST

427
00:46:19,735 --> 00:46:22,112
Did she come to Jeju all by herself?

428
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:32,372
ABANG SUNDAE

429
00:46:32,456 --> 00:46:33,874
Move, you bastard!

430
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:37,920
Whose car do you think
would be easier to move? Yours or mine?

431
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,505
You little bastard.

432
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:40,881
Just move, either of you.

433
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,175
Yes, ma'am.

434
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,095
-Move while I'm being nice.
-You move.

435
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:50,015
Why are you fighting in front of us?

436
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:53,894
Do you want me to hit you?

437
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,271
I don't have a choice. Just hit me.

438
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,357
Damn you! Just stop.

439
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,816
Damn who?

440
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,068
Go over there!

441
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,694
And you, over there.

442
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,696
-Look how narrow it is!
-He can just move!

443
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,990
-Why should I?
-Can't you see they're watching?

444
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:10,244
Just move both of your cars!

445
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,871
If not, then just pay me back my money!

446
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,708
Damn it.

447
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:18,961
I'll move.

448
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,713
Move.

449
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:23,257
No, let me.

450
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:28,262
That damn money.

451
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,013
-Damn it!
-Jeez.

452
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:31,306
BANG FAMILY ICE

453
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,432
Damn it!

454
00:47:33,141 --> 00:47:33,976
Jeez!

455
00:47:37,854 --> 00:47:40,023
They're always baring
their teeth at each other.

456
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:42,067
What will happen

457
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,320
to Yeong-ju and Hyeon?

458
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:50,617
That has nothing to do with me.

459
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,331
They used to be
so close that they moved in

460
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,458
next to each other after getting married.

461
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,377
So what in the world happened?

462
00:48:01,003 --> 00:48:03,380
I don't know for sure either.

463
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:06,341
Ho-sik said he had his reasons.

464
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:08,343
But he never told me.

465
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,765
Don't make me laugh. I'm not pregnant.

466
00:48:14,725 --> 00:48:18,186
I was queasy that day,
but the driver wouldn't pull over.

467
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:24,234
Stop being nosy
and just focus on your studies.

468
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,287
You're wearing a slimming belt.

469
00:48:36,455 --> 00:48:37,956
You can tell, even with this on.

470
00:48:44,212 --> 00:48:45,380
What's wrong?

471
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:46,965
Seon-mi caught on.

472
00:48:48,091 --> 00:48:49,468
Everyone will know soon.

473
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,473
I'll tell my dad about it.

474
00:48:54,556 --> 00:48:57,142
-Let's go to class.
-Hey.

475
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,145
Why are you guys
always together these days?

476
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:02,522
-Are you two going out?
-Come on.

477
00:49:03,273 --> 00:49:05,192
Yes. So what?

478
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,568
Seriously?

479
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:08,320
-I told you! Give it to me.
-Jeez.

480
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,030
-Hey, over here.
-Guys!

481
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,032
Yeong-ju and Hyeon are going out!

482
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:13,742
They're going out.

483
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:15,494
-Who?
-What was that?

484
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,956
They were going to find out anyway.

485
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,883
Fine. Let's just look ahead from now on.

486
00:49:58,203 --> 00:50:00,330
What is your dad to you?

487
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,875
-A friend.
-I see.

488
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:06,169
He's like a friend to you.

489
00:50:06,837 --> 00:50:08,630
Then what about your mom?

490
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,215
She's…

491
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,089
PUREUNG

492
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,341
So tell me about your past relationships.

493
00:50:55,886 --> 00:50:58,305
How many were there? Who were they?

494
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,681
Why did you break up?

495
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,810
I don't want to talk about the past.

496
00:51:04,478 --> 00:51:06,188
But I'm curious.

497
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,193
Well…

498
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,779
She went to Seoul, so we broke up.

499
00:51:16,615 --> 00:51:19,743
-She was--
-"She was kind."

500
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:22,537
"I didn't think
someone like me deserved her."

501
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,123
"So I let her go out of love."

502
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,667
You better not say
some nonsense like that.

503
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:31,338
Are men just taught
to say the same things?

504
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:34,132
People who make
such absurd excuses disgust me.

505
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,342
Why break up with a kind girl?

506
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,345
For her sake?
Then you shouldn't have dated.

507
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:40,055
You got sick of her and broke up.

508
00:51:40,138 --> 00:51:43,099
Then what about me?
Are you dating me because I'm not kind?

509
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:44,893
What a lunatic.

510
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:50,148
Not you.
I'm talking about my ex, Cheol-ung.

511
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:53,693
-You startled me.
-So tell me.

512
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:55,403
When was your first love?

513
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:57,030
Why did you break up?

514
00:51:57,113 --> 00:51:58,573
Right. Just so you know,

515
00:51:58,657 --> 00:52:00,242
don't say it's me.

516
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,953
I'm already unhappy about the fact
that I'm older than you.

517
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:06,873
Well…

518
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,292
It was this girl I dated
all throughout high school.

519
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:12,879
I was going to study engineering,

520
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,507
and she was going
to study education in Jeju.

521
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:18,343
But my grades were too low,
so I gave up on university.

522
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,011
She got good grades

523
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,180
and ended up
attending a university in Seoul.

524
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:24,015
-Then she texted me one day.
-Okay.

525
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,141
"I don't like Jeju."

526
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,269
"I'm sorry. Goodbye."

527
00:52:27,853 --> 00:52:29,187
Then she ghosted me.

528
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:31,314
It hurt a lot back then.

529
00:52:32,107 --> 00:52:33,233
But now, I'm over it.

530
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,819
Because I don't like girls
who don't like Jeju.

531
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:47,163
I like Jeju.

532
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:50,959
And after that?

533
00:52:53,336 --> 00:52:55,463
When I was still struggling
over the breakup,

534
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:58,300
I dated this girl who liked me
for more than a year.

535
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,510
What a show-off.

536
00:53:00,594 --> 00:53:01,678
It's the truth.

537
00:53:02,929 --> 00:53:05,056
I met her out of spite.

538
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:06,975
We really didn't click.

539
00:53:07,893 --> 00:53:09,519
She wanted to be with me every day.

540
00:53:09,603 --> 00:53:12,480
But I wanted
to meet my friends and had work too.

541
00:53:13,315 --> 00:53:15,650
So I broke up with her, and she…

542
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:19,362
No way.

543
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,157
The entire town was in commotion.

544
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,784
But as of now,

545
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:28,079
she runs a clothing store in Jeju,
is married, and has twins.

546
00:53:29,122 --> 00:53:30,749
I learned something through her.

547
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,084
Don't date anyone out of spite.

548
00:53:33,168 --> 00:53:35,587
And don't date someone who likes you.

549
00:53:35,670 --> 00:53:37,547
Date someone you like.

550
00:53:40,342 --> 00:53:41,635
So that's why you picked me.

551
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:47,057
Hey.

552
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,768
What? Are you seducing Jeong-jun?

553
00:53:49,851 --> 00:53:52,228
Why are you looking at him so lovingly?

554
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:54,564
-Ramyeon?
-Yes, and a bowl of rice.

555
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,732
Okay.

556
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,788
When did you start liking me?

557
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,708
Since the moment I saw you.

558
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:26,805
-Are you open?
-Yes. Come on in.

559
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,398
A bottle of beer, please.

560
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,066
-I'll get it.
-Okay.

561
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:51,121
Are you staying at the bed and breakfast?

562
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:53,415
Yes.

563
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,750
What kind of snack would you like?

564
00:54:56,501 --> 00:54:57,961
Anything will do.

565
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:02,007
-Hey.
-Hey, Dong-seok.

566
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:05,301
Come on.

567
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:10,807
What was that about?

568
00:55:51,848 --> 00:55:54,517
Make yourself comfortable. I'll leave.

569
00:56:39,771 --> 00:56:43,650
Let's sing together
Even the puppies are singing

570
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:47,153
Let's sing together like the cats

571
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:50,657
Gather around and sing together

572
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,701
Gather around, my animal friends

573
00:56:53,785 --> 00:56:57,539
Let's sing together
Even the parrots are singing

574
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:00,500
Let's sing together like the rabbits…

575
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,524
Come on.

576
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,235
-Hello.
-Goodness.

577
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:38,913
Did you think you were
the only driver we had?

578
00:57:38,997 --> 00:57:41,207
Dal-i is going
to drive Chun-hui from now on.

579
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,459
Just leave.

580
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:44,002
Sorry.

581
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,179
Look at how ill-tempered she is.

582
00:57:54,762 --> 00:57:57,140
Let's go. Come on!

583
00:58:49,859 --> 00:58:53,446
DANGER
RISK OF FALLING

584
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,341
-Hello, Captain Park.
-Hello.

585
00:59:13,424 --> 00:59:15,969
-Be careful.
-Have you been well?

586
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:19,180
Be careful, don't get too greedy,
and come back safe.

587
00:59:19,264 --> 00:59:21,975
All right. Enough with your nagging.

588
00:59:22,058 --> 00:59:24,143
-Be careful.
-Goodness.

589
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,478
-Here.
-Thanks.

590
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,313
-Okay.
-Over here.

591
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:29,482
Hi.

592
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,192
Be careful.

593
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,861
-Hi, Dal-i.
-Be careful.

594
00:59:33,945 --> 00:59:35,405
Goodness.

595
00:59:35,488 --> 00:59:37,323
Hello, ma'am.

596
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,410
-Be careful.
-All right.

597
00:59:40,493 --> 00:59:42,620
-Let's go.
-Be careful.

598
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:44,455
See you later.

599
00:59:44,998 --> 00:59:48,668
Hye-ja called me at dawn
and asked me to drive them. I'm sorry.

600
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,129
Don't be sorry.

601
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:06,185
Here.

602
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,813
Dal-i.

603
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,278
Do as you please.
I'm still not leaving this island.

604
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:24,996
Yes?

605
01:00:25,079 --> 01:00:27,206
-Drink this.
-Thank you.

606
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:32,128
Are you aware that Yeong-ok
has been lying to everyone?

607
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:34,756
If not, take note of this.

608
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:37,175
We're going to kick her out.

609
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:41,763
She must have a man.
She gets a call from someone every day.

610
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,647
Why are you so late?

611
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,856
Hello.

612
01:00:51,939 --> 01:00:54,525
-Why bother coming?
-I suddenly got a stomachache.

613
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:55,860
It's okay.

614
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,612
-Gosh, I'm sorry.
-Be careful.

615
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:58,738
-Be careful.
-Thank you.

616
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,323
-Hurry up.
-Gosh.

617
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,824
-Sorry.
-You're late again.

618
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:03,201
-I'm sorry.
-Hello.

619
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:05,370
-We'll go now.
-Why were you late?

620
01:01:37,944 --> 01:01:41,948
Let's sing together
Even the puppies are singing

621
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,284
Let's sing together like the cats

622
01:01:45,368 --> 01:01:48,746
Gather around and sing together

623
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:51,666
Gather around, my animal friends…

624
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:26,576
What is your dad to you?

625
01:02:26,659 --> 01:02:28,035
A friend.

626
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:30,163
I see.

627
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:32,749
He's like a friend to you.

628
01:02:32,832 --> 01:02:34,542
Then what about your mom?

629
01:02:35,126 --> 01:02:38,129
She's sick.

630
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:40,631
That's why she can't play with me.

631
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:45,678
She's sick.

632
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:49,849
That's why she can't play with me.

633
01:03:31,682 --> 01:03:33,851
What? Wait.

634
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:35,520
Hey! Someone jumped into the water!

635
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,480
Captain Park! Stop the boat!

636
01:03:37,563 --> 01:03:38,689
Stop the boat!

637
01:03:38,773 --> 01:03:40,733
-Stop the boat!
-Stop the boat!

638
01:03:40,817 --> 01:03:42,693
-Turn the boat around!
-Someone jumped in!

639
01:03:42,777 --> 01:03:44,320
-What's going on?
-Stop!

640
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,823
Over there! What should we do?

641
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:54,247
-What's going on?
-What's wrong?

642
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,123
Stop the boat!

643
01:03:56,207 --> 01:03:58,042
Calling Maritime Police and nearby boats.

644
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,211
The location is 10°N, 20°E.

645
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:03,005
Someone jumped over
the breakwater along Pureung Sea.

646
01:04:03,756 --> 01:04:05,675
Calling Maritime Police and nearby boats.

647
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:08,135
The location is 10°N, 20°E.

648
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,721
Someone jumped over
the breakwater along Pureung Sea.

649
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:12,557
Goodness, gracious.

650
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:14,725
-Don't jump in!
-What?

651
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:17,812
Goodness. Be careful, everyone!

652
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:19,814
Be careful!

653
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:28,322
Look at that.

654
01:04:28,406 --> 01:04:30,950
-Oh, dear.
-What should we do?

655
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,537
-Someone must have jumped in!
-Gosh.

656
01:04:34,620 --> 01:04:36,289
What should we do?

657
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:57,310
ABANG SUNDAE

658
01:04:57,393 --> 01:05:01,314
PUREUNG

659
01:05:09,405 --> 01:05:11,741
Dong-seok, do you know her?

660
01:05:11,824 --> 01:05:14,035
I don't know. Just ask her yourselves.

661
01:05:14,118 --> 01:05:15,995
Did you ask her why she jumped?

662
01:05:16,078 --> 01:05:18,039
I'm going to be straightforward with you.

663
01:05:18,122 --> 01:05:20,166
-What are you saying?
-Please help me.

664
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,335
Did Yeong-ju seduce you?

665
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,462
He must have slept with you
against your will!

666
01:05:24,545 --> 01:05:26,213
Take Yeong-ju to a good hospital.

667
01:05:26,297 --> 01:05:27,632
Dad.

668
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:29,967
-Just say yes.
-No!

669
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:32,053
-No!
-Dad. Don't…

670
01:05:32,136 --> 01:05:33,220
I chose them.

671
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,806
You still belong to me!
You're my son, you bastard!

672
01:05:37,016 --> 01:05:39,435
Get in. It's windy. You'll catch a cold.

673
01:05:40,019 --> 01:05:42,313
I will never give in this time around.

674
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:44,065
-Hey--
-Don't think about dying.

675
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,775
Don't make me worried.

676
01:05:48,444 --> 01:05:53,074
