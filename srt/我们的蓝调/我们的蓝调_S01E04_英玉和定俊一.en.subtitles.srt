1
00:00:18,643 --> 00:00:21,104
YEONG-OK AND JEONG-JUN

2
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,692
A CAPTAIN AND A HAENYEO TRY NOT TO BE
SERIOUS AMIDST LIES AND RUMORS

3
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,387
Honey.

4
00:00:58,057 --> 00:00:59,142
Honey?

5
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:06,399
Seon-a.

6
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,195
Seon-a.

7
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,551
Can you please get up?

8
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:37,180
I need to go to work.

9
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,274
Make sure you chew.

10
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,278
I'm chewing.

11
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,614
Goodness.

12
00:03:18,197 --> 00:03:20,950
-"What a good boy."
-What a good boy.

13
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:23,828
Is it good?

14
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:28,124
All right.

15
00:03:33,254 --> 00:03:34,714
Here you go.

16
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,801
-Are you leaving?
-Yes.

17
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:45,808
Be safe, Honey.

18
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,651
Seon-a.

19
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,658
Can you please clean the house
while you're home?

20
00:04:04,118 --> 00:04:07,205
I did. I cleaned the rooms
and washed the dishes.

21
00:04:07,789 --> 00:04:10,708
Look at the living room. It's clean.

22
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:21,010
What about in there?

23
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,683
What is it this time?

24
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,567
I'll take care of it.

25
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,993
How about you clean this up too?

26
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,257
Smell Yeol's school uniform.

27
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,805
Do you know our clothes reek?

28
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,849
How do you wash our…

29
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,939
Then how about you do it instead?

30
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,650
Clean and do the laundry yourself.

31
00:05:18,735 --> 00:05:20,320
Why should I do everything?

32
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,822
So you want me to work and clean as well.

33
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,365
Should I bathe you too?

34
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,411
Look at yourself.
When did you last wash your hair?

35
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,704
You reek.

36
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:35,293
And can you please go to the hospital?

37
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:38,921
How long will you keep this up?

38
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,966
They say that depression is curable.

39
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:44,802
So take your medication
and receive counseling!

40
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:47,221
Dad.

41
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:49,766
Don't fight.

42
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:56,606
It's okay.

43
00:05:57,231 --> 00:05:58,357
Come here.

44
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:07,909
We have a son.

45
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,955
At least show me your will to live.

46
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:42,086
Did you not go to work?

47
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:44,422
Why are you carrying Yeol?

48
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,008
Did he not go to preschool?

49
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,386
What do you mean? I got off work.

50
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,391
His teacher said
you were neither picking him up

51
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:57,226
nor answering your phone.

52
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,229
She called me when I was with a client.

53
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,649
She told me to pick him up.

54
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:02,500
You didn't cook, did you?

55
00:09:03,459 --> 00:09:04,961
I'll eat out with Yeol.

56
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,758
YEONG-OK AND JEONG-JUN 1

57
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,205
Yeong-ok!

58
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,334
I love you!

59
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,462
-I know.
-You do?

60
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,923
It's mutual, right?

61
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,560
Yeong-ok, let's go there tonight.

62
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:49,023
I'm too wasted to walk home.

63
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,984
I can't move.

64
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:57,031
Let's spend the night there, okay?

65
00:10:57,114 --> 00:10:58,532
MOTEL

66
00:10:59,617 --> 00:11:01,160
Okay, sure.

67
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:08,626
Do you mean that?

68
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,504
Yes.

69
00:11:19,637 --> 00:11:22,765
You know I really love you, right?

70
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:25,184
Of course.

71
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,478
Okay. Let's go.

72
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,652
Let's go.

73
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:42,576
Over here.

74
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,286
Hello.

75
00:11:47,123 --> 00:11:49,333
You're really hurting my feelings.

76
00:11:50,709 --> 00:11:52,962
We agreed to go to a motel together.

77
00:11:54,338 --> 00:11:55,631
Let's go to a motel.

78
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:59,552
We're on our way there right now.

79
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,263
Really?

80
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:05,057
Really.

81
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:10,479
You're lying.

82
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:13,482
This is the way to your house.

83
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,111
Let's go to a motel.

84
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,868
Come on, Yeong-ok!

85
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,580
Gosh, the breeze!

86
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,958
Isn't it so refreshing?

87
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:34,837
I love the Jeju breeze.

88
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,716
Then let's go to a breezy motel!

89
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,843
Yeong-ok!

90
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:53,189
-Damn it!
-Hey, Captain!

91
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:02,781
What was that?

92
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:08,389
Let's talk.

93
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,765
About what?

94
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:12,101
We made a promise.

95
00:14:12,184 --> 00:14:14,186
-What promise?
-You said okay.

96
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,605
You said we'd have a lovely time together.

97
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,233
-I'm sleepy. I'm going to bed.
-Fine. Wait.

98
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,610
Calm down. First…

99
00:14:24,405 --> 00:14:27,741
Come on. What's gotten into you?
That's not right.

100
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,744
Wait, Yeong-ok. Fine, I won't do anything.

101
00:14:30,828 --> 00:14:33,205
Just let me hug you this once.

102
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,249
You said you loved me too.

103
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:37,918
I did?

104
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:41,755
When I asked if you loved me,
you said you did.

105
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,634
Did I? I don't remember.

106
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,803
Just go home already.

107
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,347
Don't make things awkward for us
when we're neighbors.

108
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,349
-Go on.
-Yeong-ok.

109
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:55,603
We always hang out together,
so why are you doing this?

110
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:58,981
-Hanging out and this is different.
-No.

111
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,151
-Come on!
-You'll wake Eun-hui up.

112
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,694
She'll kill you if she wakes up.

113
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:07,615
All the more reason to go to a motel.

114
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,164
What's your problem?

115
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:18,834
She doesn't want things
to get awkward as neighbors.

116
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:21,545
She's fine with hanging out with you.

117
00:15:23,005 --> 00:15:24,423
But this is different, okay?

118
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,216
You should get going, Captain Bae.

119
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:29,219
-Go.
-Damn it.

120
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:31,555
I won't.

121
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:36,810
When I invited you to a motel,
you said okay.

122
00:15:37,978 --> 00:15:40,689
You're not even as drunk as I am,
so tell me.

123
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,525
You said you loved me
and agreed to go to a motel.

124
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,778
Do you seriously not remember any of that?

125
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,324
Fine.

126
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,451
I remember everything.

127
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,581
Then why did you say you didn't?

128
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:00,918
Because you kept throwing yourself at me.

129
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,836
I lied since I couldn't be bothered.

130
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,965
I don't talk to drunks. Happy?

131
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,300
-But…
-Did you hear that? It was a lie.

132
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,136
She couldn't be bothered
to talk to a drunk.

133
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,514
That's why she lied, okay?

134
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:15,099
Now, go.

135
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:16,475
It's getting late.

136
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,019
Let go of me.

137
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,398
I see.

138
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,567
Is this who you are?

139
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:27,695
Someone who always lies
through their teeth?

140
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,907
Yes. This is me.
I always lie through my teeth.

141
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,076
Bye, Captain Bae.

142
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,453
No, wait. You--

143
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:40,499
She said bye.

144
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,500
What's your deal?

145
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,211
This has nothing
to do with you, you bastard.

146
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,673
Who are you to interfere
when I need to talk to her?

147
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:48,882
Tell me.

148
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,886
We can talk tomorrow morning.

149
00:16:55,305 --> 00:16:57,433
You can come back in the morning, okay?

150
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:08,277
Stop staring at me and get going, okay?

151
00:17:12,072 --> 00:17:13,657
This is so frustrating!

152
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:20,164
And don't drink and drive.

153
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,957
Mind your own business, you bastard!

154
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:55,115
Hello, Officer Kim. How are you?

155
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,659
I see. I'd just like to report

156
00:17:57,743 --> 00:18:00,370
license plate 49D 5679.

157
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:03,791
Yes. The driver is driving drunk.

158
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:07,711
He left Pureung 5-ri
and is headed toward Anheung 3-ri.

159
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,255
Yes. It's Captain Bae's car.

160
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:12,800
Please check up on him.

161
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,261
He's pretty drunk, so I'm worried. Yes.

162
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,306
All right. Okay.

163
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:23,227
Safety first. Yes.

164
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,770
Goodbye.

165
00:18:36,865 --> 00:18:38,325
Why are you sitting there?

166
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:44,456
In case he comes back.

167
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,627
Are you worried about me?

168
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,550
Yes.

169
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,390
I might fall for you.

170
00:19:03,725 --> 00:19:06,061
Go to bed. I'll leave in 20 to 30 minutes.

171
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,025
Captain, do you like me?

172
00:19:17,739 --> 00:19:20,325
I advise you not to. You'll get hurt.

173
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,205
Don't tell me I didn't warn you.

174
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:28,458
You'll get hurt.

175
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,030
Care to go for a walk?

176
00:20:47,704 --> 00:20:48,580
Come out.

177
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,355
Meow.

178
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,905
It's huge.

179
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,797
Why did you come over to my house?

180
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:42,718
Just because.

181
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:46,847
Were you there to see Eun-hui?

182
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:58,608
Tell me.

183
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,446
Why were you
in front of my house at midnight?

184
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,172
What a gentleman.

185
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,679
I saw you on the road
in Captain Bae's car.

186
00:22:29,306 --> 00:22:31,183
I went there because I was worried.

187
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,063
Why were you worried about me?

188
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:52,245
You like me, don't you?

189
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,892
You're 185cm tall.

190
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:15,477
No.

191
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,982
You're 188cm tall.

192
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:23,777
Am I right?

193
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,577
-How did you know?
-Right?

194
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,580
I knew it. I could tell immediately.

195
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:39,000
My ex-boyfriend was the same height.

196
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,466
His name was Choi Seong-jun.

197
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,763
Hey. You both have "jun" in your names.

198
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,849
Seong-jun and Jeong-jun.

199
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:00,647
Goodness. Now that I think of it,

200
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:05,110
you guys look similar too. That's funny.

201
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:11,700
Before coming to Jeju two years ago,

202
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:14,911
I worked at a handmade shoe factory
in Cheongju.

203
00:24:14,995 --> 00:24:18,206
Seong-jun was a successful shoemaker,
and I was his assistant.

204
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:25,172
He was a good singer
who could also play the guitar.

205
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:28,717
Do you play the guitar?

206
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:32,721
Are you a good singer?

207
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:35,891
I see.

208
00:24:36,975 --> 00:24:38,101
Hold on.

209
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:42,147
Cheol-ung was the one
who could sing and play the guitar well.

210
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:47,235
I met Cheol-ung when I was 22,
and we dated for 2 years.

211
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,570
He was a total thug.

212
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,281
He'd always turn
into a different person when drunk.

213
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,577
He never laid a finger
on other women or me.

214
00:24:56,161 --> 00:24:59,331
But he always got into fights
with other men when drunk.

215
00:25:00,498 --> 00:25:01,708
I dumped him.

216
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:05,462
He picked a fight
with a passerby while drunk one day.

217
00:25:05,545 --> 00:25:08,215
So I called the police and left Gangneung.

218
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,843
After that, I went to Cheongju
and met Seong-jun.

219
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:15,722
Have you only lived in Jeju?

220
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:19,392
Yes.

221
00:25:20,268 --> 00:25:23,647
I've lived in Seoul, Incheon, Gangneung,

222
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,983
Cheongju, Tongyeong, and finally, Jeju.

223
00:25:27,067 --> 00:25:27,943
No, wait.

224
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,446
After Tongyeong,
I went to Busan and Hallim, Jeju.

225
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:34,032
And now, Pureung, Seogwipo.

226
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:40,205
Why do you move around so much?

227
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:45,543
Sometimes for work, sometimes for a guy.
And sometimes because of a breakup.

228
00:25:47,128 --> 00:25:49,005
Have you ever had a girlfriend before?

229
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,638
Tell me.

230
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,474
I told you about mine,
so it's your turn now.

231
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:09,234
Let's go back.

232
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,529
All right. Let's go.

233
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,615
I need to dive tomorrow anyway.

234
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:35,218
Quando, quando

235
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,846
How many men has she dated?

236
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:46,623
Could I love a woman who has been
in so many relationships in the past?

237
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,599
What's my plan now?

238
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:11,022
Stop being vague about it
and make your move.

239
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,317
CONVENIENCE STORE

240
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,988
My nephew is known here in Seogwipo
for his drawing skills.

241
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,156
That's strange.

242
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:25,870
Did your mother really say
that he had no talent?

243
00:28:26,413 --> 00:28:27,580
Jeez.

244
00:28:27,664 --> 00:28:31,167
Could it be because
she only saw the photos?

245
00:28:31,251 --> 00:28:33,545
They're incredible
when you see them in person.

246
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:38,174
How can he prepare
for his university entrance exams?

247
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:40,135
His teacher will tell him.

248
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:45,014
His teacher told him
to attend a university in Jeju.

249
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,142
Then he can do that.

250
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,394
That'll be 20,000 won.

251
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:51,938
Wouldn't it be better

252
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:54,941
if he attended
a prestigious university in Seoul?

253
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:58,069
I don't think he's that talented.

254
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,362
Goodbye.

255
00:29:01,197 --> 00:29:02,282
Unbelievable.

256
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,207
Is your mother really an artist?

257
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:14,627
If she is, let me see some of her work!

258
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:20,633
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

259
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:36,524
Hello, everyone.

260
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,734
Have you eaten?

261
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:38,943
Yes, I have.

262
00:29:41,237 --> 00:29:42,280
Going to school?

263
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,365
-Yes.
-Are you studying well?

264
00:29:46,910 --> 00:29:48,244
What are you staring at?

265
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,208
Did you say hello to the elderly?

266
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:01,007
Roll it down.

267
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,063
More.

268
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:24,989
All the way.

269
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:40,505
I'm watching you, you brat.

270
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:43,758
So what if you're the top student?
You need to have manners.

271
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,599
She's not my mom.

272
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,060
You're not even her daughter.

273
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,493
My period is overdue.

274
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,376
Look ahead. People are looking.

275
00:31:24,132 --> 00:31:26,926
Get some money ready, just in case.

276
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,101
It can't be.

277
00:31:35,184 --> 00:31:38,688
She wouldn't lie to us about her parents.

278
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,689
What for?

279
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:43,401
Then why did she tell
the convenience store lady

280
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:45,236
that her mother was an artist

281
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,698
and then tell me that her parents
had a store in Dongdaemun?

282
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:50,158
Is that what she said?

283
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:52,619
She told me that she had no parents.

284
00:31:52,702 --> 00:31:55,121
-What?
-What?

285
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:58,374
That damn girl.

286
00:31:58,458 --> 00:32:00,126
See?

287
00:32:00,209 --> 00:32:03,880
She's been lying to everyone.

288
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,590
We caught her red-handed.

289
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,718
What did Yeong-ok say to you?

290
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:12,764
Chun-hui, you shouldn't trust that brat.

291
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:15,224
We shouldn't befriend her.

292
00:32:15,308 --> 00:32:17,268
-That's enough.
-Chun-hui.

293
00:32:17,352 --> 00:32:19,562
Let's fire her from this job.

294
00:32:19,646 --> 00:32:21,940
I won't condone liars.

295
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:26,444
She flirts with all the men around here
and has tainted our neighborhood.

296
00:32:26,527 --> 00:32:29,948
Captain Park has fallen
head over heels for her.

297
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:31,908
He had agreed to go on a date
with my daughter

298
00:32:31,991 --> 00:32:34,243
but backed out because of her.

299
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:36,079
Goodness.

300
00:32:37,914 --> 00:32:38,998
She's here.

301
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:42,377
I'm sorry I'm late.

302
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,587
Why are you always late?

303
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,547
I told you many times
to come before the high tide!

304
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:48,383
You're always late at dawn.

305
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:50,134
Why are you late today?

306
00:32:50,218 --> 00:32:52,136
When will you start arriving on time?

307
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,639
I had to buy motion-sickness pills.

308
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,516
You and your excuses.

309
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,726
-I'm sorry.
-Jeez.

310
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,894
I'm sorry.

311
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,607
I'm sorry, guys.

312
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,611
Pick up the phone.

313
00:33:09,195 --> 00:33:10,780
I don't need to.

314
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:15,326
Unbelievable. It's not right
to ignore someone's call.

315
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,289
She's always getting calls.

316
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:22,750
Even when she's at sea.

317
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:27,005
She definitely has a husband
or a child on the mainland.

318
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,339
Stop spitting on me.

319
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,093
Ms. Hyeon, did you sleep well?

320
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:37,598
Let's go then.

321
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:49,402
JEONJIN 1

322
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:59,203
Make sure you come up on time.

323
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:03,082
Planning to head back at 2 p.m.

324
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,461
I repeat. Planning to head back at 2 p.m.

325
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,144
Hey, Captain!

326
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,480
Are you mad at me?

327
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,273
Are you going to ignore me?

328
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,361
I see.

329
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,033
What's she talking about?

330
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:39,827
Did something happen?

331
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:23,955
EASY CHECK ONE
QUICK AND EASY PREGNANCY TEST KIT

332
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,332
Don't. Seon-mi is here.

333
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,378
Wait. My wallet!

334
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,090
You said you'd buy tasty bread for us.

335
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,592
That's why we came all the way here.

336
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:38,094
Hey, vice-president.

337
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:40,596
What's that?

338
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,225
ULTRA SLIM WITH WINGS

339
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,561
I told him to buy it.

340
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:49,647
You're abusing your power
as class president.

341
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:51,357
This is school violence.

342
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,776
Why do you treat him
as if he's your minion?

343
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:55,987
Are you her minion?

344
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,530
So what if I am?

345
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,116
Lunchtime is almost over.
Go back to school.

346
00:36:02,493 --> 00:36:05,163
-That was cool.
-Why are you impressed?

347
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:07,123
Be late for class, and I'll kill you.

348
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:08,833
You crazy bitch.

349
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,129
Kill who?

350
00:36:13,838 --> 00:36:14,881
Answer me.

351
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:17,466
Who's a crazy bitch?

352
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,719
Her?

353
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:21,888
Or them?

354
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:24,640
It's not him, is it?

355
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:26,350
It's probably all of us.

356
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:28,269
She always swears at us.

357
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:30,062
And she thinks Hyeon is her minion.

358
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:31,939
She made him buy sanitary pads--

359
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:32,982
-Hey.
-Hey.

360
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:34,275
Stop it.

361
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:36,027
Hey.

362
00:36:36,944 --> 00:36:38,696
Are you her minion, you brat?

363
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,947
Are you?

364
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:42,116
You little brat.

365
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,536
Where do you think…

366
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,373
-I'll kill you.
-What?

367
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,043
Hey, you brat.
Why would you kill your friend?

368
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,420
Are you a thug? You impudent brat.

369
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:58,674
You better not walk over Hyeon
just because he's kindhearted! Got it?

370
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:01,177
If you do,
I'll teach your father a lesson!

371
00:37:02,470 --> 00:37:04,764
You too, Hyeon! Don't be a pushover!

372
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,558
Be a man, will you?

373
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,518
Pick a date.

374
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:11,896
What?

375
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,399
Pick a date. You said
you wanted to teach me a lesson.

376
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:18,277
For your information,
I'm booked on Thursdays.

377
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,865
Here are 20 of the 2kg bags of ice cubes.

378
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,660
-Hello, how are you?
-Hello, how are you?

379
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,954
Not good, thanks to this man.

380
00:37:28,037 --> 00:37:28,996
Here.

381
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,041
-Sir, could you buy these for us?
-Could you buy these for us?

382
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,752
That won't be enough.

383
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,214
Come here. Don't you guys like
gummies and chocolate?

384
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,882
-Yes, we love them.
-And this.

385
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,677
-Have some chocolate.
-No way.

386
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,681
-Hey, I don't have any money.
-Sorry?

387
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,599
But he does.

388
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:52,186
The vice-president's father
is rich and likes to show off.

389
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,230
He'll treat you.

390
00:37:54,313 --> 00:37:55,273
Aren't I right?

391
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,066
Goodbye.

392
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,860
-Thank you!
-Thank you.

393
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,612
We didn't get that many.

394
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:03,572
-We're so lucky.
-Can I buy this too?

395
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,910
Stop stuffing your faces, will you?

396
00:38:10,454 --> 00:38:11,622
But…

397
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,960
-I'll buy that later.
-You need to pay for--

398
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,128
Later.

399
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:26,679
The pregnancy test kit.

400
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,976
I'll get it somewhere far away
on my way home from the academy.

401
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,229
So go to your private lesson.

402
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,250
Goodness.

403
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,252
My gosh.

404
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,508
-Goodness.
-They're so big.

405
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,220
Look at how big this one is.

406
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,350
Good job.

407
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:15,728
I caught so many.

408
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,104
Look at this one.

409
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,359
-I worked hard.
-I know.

410
00:39:22,443 --> 00:39:25,071
Goodness. Look at this one.

411
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:26,739
We're all here, so let's go.

412
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:28,866
Okay.

413
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,080
Wait. Yeong-ok isn't back yet.

414
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:35,706
-What?
-What? Yeong-ok?

415
00:39:36,415 --> 00:39:37,666
What?

416
00:39:40,586 --> 00:39:41,754
Is she not here?

417
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:42,963
What?

418
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,467
I can't see her buoy.

419
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,971
She must've not put enough stones inside,
so it must've floated away.

420
00:39:51,555 --> 00:39:52,807
I doubt it.

421
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:55,810
She must have been greedy
about catching more and gone far away.

422
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:57,144
That brat went out of bounds.

423
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,773
Jeez, where is she? It's freezing!

424
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:05,111
What should we do?

425
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,780
The waves are pretty strong.

426
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:10,491
We should get going before it gets worse.

427
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:12,451
What should we do?

428
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,037
-She went out of bounds.
-Resurface!

429
00:40:15,121 --> 00:40:16,122
What…

430
00:40:16,205 --> 00:40:18,207
Resurface!

431
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:19,500
Resurface.

432
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,960
-Yeong-ok.
-Yeong-ok!

433
00:40:21,043 --> 00:40:24,046
-Yeong-ok, resurface.
-Resurface!

434
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:26,340
Yeong-ok, resurface.

435
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,509
-Resurface.
-That little…

436
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:30,094
-Yeong-ok.
-Resurface!

437
00:40:30,177 --> 00:40:32,179
-Resurface!
-Yeong-ok!

438
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:33,848
Resurface!

439
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:37,017
-Yeong-ok, resurface!
-Resurface!

440
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:39,979
-Yeong-ok, resurface!
-Resurface!

441
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:43,023
-Unbelievable.
-Lee Yeong-ok!

442
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:45,609
-Resurface!
-Yeong-ok!

443
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,027
What should we do?

444
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,946
-Yeong-ok!
-What should we do?

445
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,615
-Yeong-ok!
-Where is she?

446
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,908
Yeong-ok!

447
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,244
Should we call the coast guard?

448
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:56,745
Resurface!

449
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,789
What is going on?

450
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:01,208
-This is Jeonjin 1.
-Resurface!

451
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,545
One of our haenyeos is missing.

452
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,588
Resurface!

453
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,590
We ask those in the area to locate
a floral-patterned buoy.

454
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,883
Yeong-ok!

455
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:10,843
Please look for a floral-patterned buoy.

456
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,052
Resurface!

457
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,730
What the hell have you done?

458
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,316
All the elderly came out on time.

459
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:28,027
But you wanted to catch more abalone

460
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,612
and was ten minutes late.

461
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:31,697
Didn't we tell you to resurface

462
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,741
five minutes beforehand and wait?

463
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,409
You're a crazy brat!

464
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,244
Take a look!

465
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:39,788
Can't you see how old they are?

466
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,832
Chun-hui is 70 and lives alone.

467
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:44,585
What will you do if she catches a cold?

468
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,671
Will you dive underwater
and get the abalone for her?

469
00:41:47,755 --> 00:41:50,966
Or will you take her to the hospital
and then tend to her at home?

470
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,302
That's enough.

471
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,138
What do you mean?
She's only stating the facts.

472
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:59,183
Teamwork is crucial for haenyeos,

473
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:01,227
but you always go on your own.

474
00:42:01,310 --> 00:42:04,688
Do you want to catch a lot of abalones
and get rich that badly?

475
00:42:06,899 --> 00:42:09,401
Look! I'm sick because of you!

476
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:14,198
Yeong-ok, just say that you're sorry.

477
00:42:17,493 --> 00:42:18,619
I'm sorry.

478
00:42:19,411 --> 00:42:21,497
Look at her. She doesn't even mean it.

479
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:25,376
Chun-hui, we seriously need
to do something about her.

480
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:29,171
One day, she's going
to be the death of us.

481
00:42:29,255 --> 00:42:32,466
It's about time she quit.
How long will you tolerate this?

482
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,553
-Just let her be.
-Don't be ridiculous.

483
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:39,431
She's only being like that
because you don't say anything about it.

484
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:42,142
Do you think she'd listen to me?

485
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,728
She's an impudent, disobedient brat.

486
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,730
Goodness.

487
00:42:46,814 --> 00:42:50,901
We shouldn't have accepted strangers
to work with us.

488
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:54,738
You guys said those from the mainland
should become haenyeos too.

489
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,784
You convinced the fishing village chief
to build a haenyeo school.

490
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:01,036
This only happened because you let her in.

491
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,329
What did I say?

492
00:43:02,413 --> 00:43:05,291
I was against
accepting those from the mainland.

493
00:43:05,374 --> 00:43:09,670
We were only for it
because we needed someone

494
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,630
to continue the haenyeo legacy.

495
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,883
We had no choice.
The Jeju Provincial Office suggested it.

496
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,720
So what if
there are no more haenyeos left?

497
00:43:17,803 --> 00:43:19,722
It's not a big deal.

498
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:21,765
We'll all die one day anyway.

499
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,104
So don't talk to her ever again.

500
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,817
If she has an ounce of conscience,
she'll leave on her own accord.

501
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,277
I agree.

502
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,070
-Throw this away.
-Okay.

503
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:36,739
Goodness.

504
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:37,781
Let's do that.

505
00:43:37,865 --> 00:43:40,951
Goodness. She's right.
We should listen to her.

506
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:45,247
Let's not scold that brat anymore.
It'll only tire us out.

507
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,041
All right.

508
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,211
Goodness.

509
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:53,422
Unbelievable.

510
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,886
Apologize to Chun-hui.

511
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:01,138
If not, you'll really get kicked out.

512
00:44:08,103 --> 00:44:09,772
Is she crazy? Why would I do that?

513
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:12,024
What did I do so wrong?

514
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:13,609
They're so sensitive.

515
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:16,362
Was I gone for 30 minutes? An hour?

516
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:19,365
It was only ten minutes,
but they're treating me like a sinner.

517
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:23,243
We wouldn't be here
had you been an hour late.

518
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:25,079
We'd be attending your funeral by now.

519
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:28,707
We weren't even on land.

520
00:44:28,791 --> 00:44:30,292
For those at sea,

521
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:33,796
being a minute or two late
could be a life-and-death situation.

522
00:44:34,296 --> 00:44:37,966
Byeol-i cried when I didn't arrive on time
because she thought I was dead.

523
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:42,054
My buoy had drifted away,
so I had to retrieve it.

524
00:44:42,137 --> 00:44:43,806
You had an awful amount of abalone

525
00:44:43,889 --> 00:44:45,724
for someone who
accidentally went out of bounds.

526
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:47,518
I know it was intentional.

527
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:50,771
Everyone thought something
had happened to you.

528
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,691
Hye-ja will feel better
once she takes some cold medicine.

529
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,527
But we really thought you were dead.

530
00:44:56,610 --> 00:45:00,948
After a couple of minutes, everyone was
all ready to jump in to save you.

531
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:03,534
But none of them did. Not even you.

532
00:45:03,617 --> 00:45:05,702
Because Captain Park
had radioed a nearby boat

533
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:09,498
and found out that you were
still catching abalone far away.

534
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:16,422
You know what? I think the world of you,
but this isn't right.

535
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,007
You're better off quitting.

536
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,469
Teamwork is crucial
no matter the number of haenyeos.

537
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:25,013
We move as one
and always put our loyalty first.

538
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:26,598
You're not suited for this job.

539
00:45:30,936 --> 00:45:33,063
Teamwork, my foot.

540
00:45:33,147 --> 00:45:36,733
In the end, you're only interested
in who caught the most fish.

541
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,235
Loyalty?

542
00:45:38,318 --> 00:45:40,863
You just stick to the likes of you.

543
00:45:40,946 --> 00:45:42,573
You're just a gang of Jeju natives.

544
00:45:43,949 --> 00:45:47,161
Apologize to Ms. Hyeon.
Or else, we're no longer friends.

545
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:02,593
There are 500 conches. That's 556kg.

546
00:46:02,676 --> 00:46:04,219
-And 330 abalones.
-Correct.

547
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:06,597
-And 115 sea urchins?
-Correct.

548
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:12,895
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

549
00:46:12,978 --> 00:46:14,396
-Bye.
-Bye.

550
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,078
So what if you stare?

551
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:39,296
I came all the way here
from the Yellow Sea to make ends meet.

552
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,632
That's why I had put up with your shit.

553
00:46:42,758 --> 00:46:44,593
Did you think I was a pushover?

554
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:48,805
Hey. You reported
that I was driving drunk, didn't you?

555
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,600
They suspended my license
thanks to you, you asshole!

556
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,646
I told you not to drink and drive.

557
00:46:58,941 --> 00:47:01,860
-What grudge do you have against me?
-I have none.

558
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:05,322
Just be a law-abiding citizen.

559
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,699
Don't drink and drive.

560
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,411
Did Yeong-ok, that brat,
flirt with you too?

561
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,834
Come to your senses.

562
00:47:17,918 --> 00:47:21,797
Hey. I spent millions of won
on buying her drinks.

563
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,715
That's the type of girl she is.

564
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:27,010
She seduces men with her smile
and makes them pay for her drinks.

565
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:31,807
And you're no exception, so be careful.

566
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,106
You little…

567
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:43,277
It's been a while since I had a fistfight.

568
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:45,070
You're dead meat now.

569
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,363
You're dead!

570
00:47:47,781 --> 00:47:49,908
Hey! Stop it!

571
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,660
That's enough! Hey! Stop!

572
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:53,579
Hey! Jeong-jun, what's wrong?

573
00:47:53,662 --> 00:47:54,746
Let him come at me.

574
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,373
Let me give him a good beating!

575
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:59,251
Captain Bae, you'll die
if you get into a fight with him.

576
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:02,004
Do you think
he's some softy who drives a boat?

577
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:06,008
Come on. You've never seen him fight

578
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:08,343
but look at the size of this.

579
00:48:08,427 --> 00:48:10,554
One punch from him,
and you could die. Got it?

580
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,307
If we don't have a hammer, we call him.

581
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:15,017
I'm serious.

582
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,476
Just go.

583
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:19,062
You don't want to break your bones
away from home. Just go.

584
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,397
Be the bigger person.

585
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:25,652
I was a pretty notorious thug
at the Yellow Sea.

586
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:27,613
Good for you.

587
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,157
All right. You should leave.

588
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:32,534
Come to your senses.

589
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,703
Yeong-ok doesn't like you.

590
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:37,456
Ask her out, and you'll see.

591
00:48:37,539 --> 00:48:40,125
All right. I was going to anyway.

592
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:41,209
Don't make me laugh.

593
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,545
A wimp like you could never ask her out.

594
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,088
You always follow her around.

595
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,632
What an idiot.

596
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:47,841
Come on.

597
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,053
Jeez!

598
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,972
Hey, what's with you?

599
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:55,891
I didn't raise you to be like this.

600
00:48:56,475 --> 00:48:57,809
Fist fighting in public?

601
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,604
You're not Dong-seok.
You need to be mature.

602
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:02,981
One more thing.

603
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,275
What's this about Yeong-ok?

604
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:10,447
Are you guys in a love triangle?

605
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:14,201
In that case,

606
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:18,330
promise me you'll win. Okay?

607
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:21,083
Bye.

608
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:23,919
Don't fight in public.
I know you have a good heart.

609
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:26,880
Seeing you like this breaks my heart.

610
00:49:26,963 --> 00:49:28,840
-All right. Bye.
-Bye.

611
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:31,885
ICE

612
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:35,764
My hometown is in the southern sea

613
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:40,769
I can see the emerald-green waters

614
00:49:55,992 --> 00:49:58,745
YEONG-OK
SPEAKER-MODE

615
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,681
The green onions
are quite nice this season.

616
00:50:23,061 --> 00:50:24,479
CAPTAIN JEONG-JUN

617
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:33,780
Hey, Captain.

618
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,742
I thought you were upset and ignoring me.

619
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,995
Let's meet later tonight.

620
00:50:40,787 --> 00:50:41,872
Where?

621
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,000
Where would you like to meet?

622
00:50:47,002 --> 00:50:50,797
How about inside your bus?
I've never been inside.

623
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,343
Come by at 10 p.m.

624
00:50:55,427 --> 00:50:57,220
I'll be done with work by then.

625
00:50:58,096 --> 00:50:59,222
Okay.

626
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,109
Either tell her to leave or talk to her.

627
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:13,528
How long will you keep her
waiting out there?

628
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,822
Just prep the green onions.

629
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:27,959
Here.

630
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,170
I don't feel too good.

631
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,631
Goodness, that darn stomach of yours.

632
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:44,392
I'm sorry, ma'am.

633
00:51:59,783 --> 00:52:00,951
You should just leave.

634
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:04,204
Once Chun-hui is upset,

635
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:06,873
she won't talk again
until she's no longer mad.

636
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:09,876
Waiting here won't do you any good.

637
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,216
I'm truly sorry.

638
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:18,218
I won't do that again.

639
00:52:18,718 --> 00:52:20,762
I'll resurface on time.

640
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:22,597
I won't go out of bounds.

641
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:26,393
Bring the green onions over.
Can't you see I'm washing them?

642
00:52:28,687 --> 00:52:30,730
I'll pick you up tomorrow morning.

643
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:32,732
Don't bother.

644
00:52:34,693 --> 00:52:37,487
Why did you lie to the others?

645
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:39,656
Who are you really?

646
00:52:40,407 --> 00:52:41,908
"My mother passed away."

647
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,827
"My mother has a clothing store."

648
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:46,204
Recently, you told someone
that she was an artist.

649
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:50,041
Unless you're crazy,
why would you lie to them?

650
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:51,376
Why did you come here

651
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:54,504
to become a haenyeo
if you're going to inconvenience everyone?

652
00:53:16,109 --> 00:53:17,235
Here.

653
00:53:19,863 --> 00:53:23,283
I can tell that she won't be
a haenyeo for long.

654
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:25,702
Don't let her grow on you.

655
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,204
Let her leave on her own.

656
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:30,832
I'm going home.

657
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,877
Get home safe.

658
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,987
Where are you off to?

659
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:03,114
You should go home.

660
00:54:05,909 --> 00:54:06,743
Go home.

661
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:08,263
Where have you been?

662
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,182
Setting down fixed nets.

663
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:13,810
You're always working.

664
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:32,787
What is this vibe? It's so artistic.

665
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:35,206
-This is all I have.
-Okay.

666
00:55:36,291 --> 00:55:37,792
It's so pretty.

667
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:55,351
It's mesmerizing to watch
the sea from inside a vehicle.

668
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,446
Do you like Jeju?

669
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,199
Of course, I do.

670
00:56:09,282 --> 00:56:10,450
How much?

671
00:56:11,159 --> 00:56:14,662
Probably not as much as you
who grew up here.

672
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,626
But I would like to spend
the rest of my life here.

673
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:29,719
Do you like Captain Bae?

674
00:56:35,308 --> 00:56:36,684
Why do you ask?

675
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:39,521
Are you the nosy type?

676
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:43,191
Why did you tell me
about your past relationships?

677
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:45,860
Why do you think I did?

678
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,781
Because you had no feelings for me
and wanted me to get lost.

679
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,325
Something like that?

680
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:01,459
No.

681
00:57:03,586 --> 00:57:05,463
Because I could tell you liked me.

682
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:09,759
"I'm a woman with a past…"

683
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:11,427
No.

684
00:57:11,511 --> 00:57:13,972
"I'm a woman
with such memories and experiences."

685
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:18,601
"If you can't handle me, give up now."
Something like that.

686
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:20,562
And Captain Bae?

687
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:26,276
I think he has feelings for me.

688
00:57:27,777 --> 00:57:28,987
But not me.

689
00:57:29,612 --> 00:57:31,948
He liked clubbing,
so we went together a few times.

690
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,452
If you want a clear answer,

691
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:37,787
I've been disliking him since yesterday.

692
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,172
My turn.

693
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:52,218
Is that about me?

694
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,053
HOW MANY MEN HAS SHE DATED?

695
00:57:56,848 --> 00:57:58,057
Yes.

696
00:58:01,895 --> 00:58:05,648
"How many men has she dated?"

697
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,651
Are you curious?

698
00:58:10,904 --> 00:58:12,197
Then we'll pass.

699
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:13,865
Next question.

700
00:58:15,116 --> 00:58:18,286
"Could I love a woman who has been

701
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:21,164
in so many relationships in the past?"

702
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:25,877
Do you have an answer for that one?

703
00:58:27,504 --> 00:58:28,630
I do.

704
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:31,007
Could you or could you not?

705
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,800
I could.

706
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,019
"What's my plan now?"

707
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:47,690
"Stop being vague about it
and make your move."

708
00:58:47,774 --> 00:58:48,858
Let's go out.

709
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:58,201
You'll get hurt.

710
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:02,872
Then try not to hurt me.

711
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,334
Why are you determined to hurt me?

712
00:59:15,134 --> 00:59:16,511
Do you need time?

713
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:18,555
To think?

714
00:59:22,183 --> 00:59:23,393
No.

715
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,701
I'm from Jeju.

716
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:26,164
Please help me.

717
01:00:26,247 --> 01:00:27,123
I don't want to.

718
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:29,292
Do you not love me?

719
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,752
Love doesn't exist.

720
01:00:31,419 --> 01:00:33,421
It could be different for us.

721
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:34,339
I'M SCREWED

722
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:37,091
Because I don't like girls
who don't like Jeju.

723
01:00:37,175 --> 01:00:38,009
PUREUNG

724
01:00:38,092 --> 01:00:38,968
I like Jeju.

725
01:00:40,386 --> 01:00:41,804
Stop avoiding me and let's talk.

726
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,389
Am I not worth having feelings for?

727
01:00:44,182 --> 01:00:45,600
Because I'm poor?

728
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:48,019
Let's think this through.

729
01:00:48,102 --> 01:00:49,937
Let's be real. Are we that much in love?

730
01:00:52,398 --> 01:00:54,150
Since when were we that close?

731
01:00:55,485 --> 01:00:56,694
Don't ever call me again.

732
01:00:57,904 --> 01:01:00,323
If you truly care about me, then move.

733
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,325
Shouldn't you be at school?

734
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:08,164
