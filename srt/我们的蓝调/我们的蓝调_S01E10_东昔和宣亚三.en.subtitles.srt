1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,862
DONG-SEOK AND SEON-A

2
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:30,613
PAST WOUNDS ON AN UNEXPECTED ROAD,
YOUR WARMTH IN AN ARCADE ON A RAINY DAY

3
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:18,661
-Ma'am, we're going home now.
-Bye.

4
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,581
We feel bad
that you still have work to do.

5
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,999
-Right.
-Really?

6
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:24,959
Then sharpen these blades for me.

7
00:01:25,043 --> 00:01:26,252
-Bye.
-Bye.

8
00:01:27,128 --> 00:01:28,880
-Just go.
-I'm going.

9
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,883
You better go straight home.
Don't stay out drinking.

10
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:34,427
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am. You too!

11
00:01:36,387 --> 00:01:37,889
Darn it.

12
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:40,183
Why do I keep cutting myself?

13
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,147
I must be getting old.

14
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:48,775
I keep getting cut.

15
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,495
Unbelievable.

16
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,288
Those darn boys.

17
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:05,583
Are they being sloppy
since they're not the boss?

18
00:02:06,543 --> 00:02:07,710
Jeez.

19
00:02:09,212 --> 00:02:11,798
They would've been tidier if they were.

20
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,093
Goodness.

21
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,492
I'm coming!

22
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,598
My head.

23
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:06,269
Gosh, that's painful.

24
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:08,855
How refreshing.

25
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,525
You've worked hard, Jung Eun-hui.

26
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,404
This is your time now.

27
00:03:16,487 --> 00:03:19,240
Enjoy it!

28
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,374
This is good.

29
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,629
JEONG-SIK

30
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:36,716
You better not be calling me about money.

31
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,384
Can you lend me 20 million won?

32
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,012
My car is so rundown.
I'll pay you back next month.

33
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,263
Don't be ridiculous.

34
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:43,681
You will never pay me back.

35
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,309
Call me again in the morning.

36
00:03:50,188 --> 00:03:51,814
Look at that.

37
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,901
The male lead is so handsome.

38
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,072
What an eye candy.

39
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:01,699
MI-RAN

40
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,578
She always bothers me
when I'm trying to relax.

41
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,001
MI-RAN

42
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,878
Loyalty.

43
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,004
Loyalty!

44
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:20,385
Eun-hui, I drank so much.

45
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:22,971
I can totally tell.

46
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,975
I'm drunk, and I miss you terribly.

47
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:29,310
Do you know that?

48
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:33,273
Hey everyone, say hello!
This is Jung Eun-hui, my friend.

49
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,276
-She's the most loyal person ever.
-I'm in my camisole!

50
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:37,902
She's my best friend!

51
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:40,029
Eun-hui, they're my employees

52
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,824
-at the massage parlor.
-That little brat.

53
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,828
-Jeez.
-Hey, come on.

54
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,705
-It's okay.
-Hold on.

55
00:04:49,414 --> 00:04:52,667
Hey, you brat.

56
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,502
Guys, she's back! Say hi!

57
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,296
-Hello.
-Hello.

58
00:04:57,171 --> 00:04:58,840
Okay. That's enough.

59
00:04:59,841 --> 00:05:00,800
Hey.

60
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:05,179
You know I'm going on a world trip
this month with my daughter, Ji-yun,

61
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,598
who's in Paris, right?

62
00:05:08,391 --> 00:05:09,726
You already told me by text.

63
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:14,272
You know I'm really sad
that I can't see you before then, right?

64
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,442
I do. I'm sad about that too.

65
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,277
You should just come.

66
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,113
How could you visit Paris but not Jeju?

67
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:25,742
We should still see each other
at least once a year, you brat.

68
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:29,746
Fine. I'll visit you
after I return from Paris.

69
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,416
You never keep your word.
I'm the only one who ends up missing you.

70
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,043
You're a terrible friend.

71
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:40,089
Still, you know I truly love you, right?

72
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:43,217
Speaking of which, my dear best friend,

73
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,636
let me dedicate this song to you.

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,055
Hey, turn that off.

75
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,766
Play my favorite song.

76
00:05:52,477 --> 00:05:57,815
-You think about others behind my back
-You think about others behind my back

77
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,694
Hey. You're good.

78
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:03,696
-I've never been wrong
-I've never been wrong

79
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:07,283
-You still got it.
-I'm worried

80
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:10,286
DONG-SEOK AND SEON-A 3

81
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,569
I told you not to come.

82
00:06:44,278 --> 00:06:46,572
You've been working all day.
Get some sleep.

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,325
You haven't been
sleeping properly for days.

84
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,373
Eat.

85
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:22,525
Let me.

86
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,197
Dong-seok?

87
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,823
Yes.

88
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:13,284
What are you doing there?

89
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:14,785
Building a house.

90
00:08:16,537 --> 00:08:17,955
Did you buy a house?

91
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,707
Just go on your way.

92
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,460
Why are you so nosy?

93
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,544
What…

94
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,180
Who is she?

95
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:38,601
Are you coming to the market?

96
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,103
Your customers and your mother
are all waiting.

97
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,360
How dare he not answer me? Impudent punk.

98
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,245
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

99
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:04,627
Isn't she the one who was saved
by the haenyeos after jumping in?

100
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,254
Why did you pick her

101
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,381
of all women?

102
00:09:08,464 --> 00:09:12,134
Everyone was worried about her.
Think about your poor mother.

103
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:15,513
You should find yourself a decent woman,

104
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,515
not someone who tried to commit…

105
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,683
Dong-seok.

106
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,768
Darn it.

107
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:23,271
Seriously.

108
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:26,524
He should meet a woman

109
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:30,987
who has lived a happier life than he has.

110
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,239
Unbelievable.

111
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:51,632
-Seon-a.
-Yes?

112
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:54,760
Does your kid like horses?

113
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,685
Yes. A lot.

114
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,065
I once bought him a yellow cup.

115
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:13,029
He likes it because of the horse drawing.

116
00:10:15,573 --> 00:10:16,699
Let's go to Seoul.

117
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,161
It's too early.

118
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:22,455
Let's go to Seoul by horse.

119
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,959
What are you talking about?

120
00:10:27,835 --> 00:10:30,713
-Let's do that next time.
-What do you mean?

121
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,798
There's no next time. Let's do it today.

122
00:10:33,758 --> 00:10:35,009
Get ready.

123
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:49,649
Suit yourself, but I'm going to work.

124
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,345
Dong-seok.

125
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:27,853
Can I ride your horses around here?

126
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:30,689
-Sure, you can.
-Really?

127
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:51,127
Dong-seok.

128
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:54,171
I'm sorry, but I'm not in the mood
for this right now.

129
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,842
The trial is just around the corner.

130
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,179
I need to go see Yeol,
but I'm worried we'll miss our ship.

131
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:05,766
You know that Jeju
is a very small island, right?

132
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:08,644
A friend of mine's sister owns this ranch.

133
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,604
Are you really not interested?

134
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,565
Let's just go.

135
00:12:12,648 --> 00:12:14,150
We'll miss our ship.

136
00:12:14,984 --> 00:12:18,571
The navigation app says
it'll take 1.5 hours to go to Jeju-si.

137
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,907
That's not long at all.
That's three hours from now.

138
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,827
-The boarding process takes a while.
-You're never going to miss the ship.

139
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,830
Had you just gotten on a horse,
we would've already been on our way.

140
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,541
I don't want to ride it.

141
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,334
Then convince yourself.

142
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:35,212
I don't want to.

143
00:12:43,095 --> 00:12:44,472
You can enjoy it.

144
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:47,892
I want to spend all my free time

145
00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:51,604
building that house
where Yeol and I will be living in.

146
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,731
I've told you several times already.

147
00:12:54,732 --> 00:12:56,817
I wanted to take the plane alone,

148
00:12:56,901 --> 00:12:59,904
but you insisted on tagging along
and taking a ship instead.

149
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:03,949
Your kid would be happy to see
a photo of you on a horse.

150
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,951
A toy horse will be enough.

151
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:09,205
Let's just go. We'll miss our ship.

152
00:13:09,788 --> 00:13:13,167
Fine. Then let me go around
this place just once.

153
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,961
Film me horseback riding
and send it to me later.

154
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:28,891
Go.

155
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:19,900
Stand next to it and smile.

156
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,569
Let's take just one photo.

157
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,363
Fine.

158
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:25,906
Smile.

159
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,035
Do you not want to go?

160
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,662
A big smile.

161
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:33,664
Like this.

162
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,668
Don't be scared.

163
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:39,461
Get up.

164
00:14:40,462 --> 00:14:42,590
-That's good. How is it?
-Jeez.

165
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,010
Done.

166
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:50,973
I took a great video.

167
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,809
I sent mine to you.

168
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,646
Didn't I take good photos of you too?

169
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,693
How did you end up becoming such a fool?

170
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:04,862
What do you mean?

171
00:15:05,988 --> 00:15:08,198
I told you not to come here
for the past two days

172
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:10,993
since I knew you'd be tired from working.

173
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,914
But you still came and worked all night.

174
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:18,959
You always do what you want to do.

175
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,253
You say there's no next time.

176
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:24,757
You always need to do it at that moment.

177
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,635
You do whatever you want.

178
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,845
Because there's no next time.

179
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:32,723
Of course there is.

180
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:37,728
After my father passed away,
my sister, mom, and I lived together.

181
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,190
We were poor, and one day,

182
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:44,777
my mother got
some pig intestines and cooked them.

183
00:15:45,569 --> 00:15:47,363
As soon as my sister saw the food,

184
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,575
she gobbled up everything
including my share.

185
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,369
I got really upset.

186
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:58,374
So I swore at her
and threw our chamber pot at her face.

187
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,877
You're so mean.

188
00:16:02,378 --> 00:16:08,133
The pee splashed all over her face
and into her mouth and nose.

189
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,346
She cried so much.

190
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,224
I felt really bad.

191
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:19,103
So I planned to apologize
the next day after school.

192
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,022
But when I came home from school,

193
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,066
I saw the haenyeo,

194
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:25,734
Ms. Hyeon,

195
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,947
carrying my sister on her back,
out of the sea.

196
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:34,618
That was the last time I saw her.

197
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,163
That's when I learned

198
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,125
that there was no next time.

199
00:17:03,981 --> 00:17:06,150
Watching the waves

200
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:08,402
is making me seasick.

201
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,405
Are you stupid just like my mom?

202
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,782
Turn around.

203
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,678
Whenever life feels suffocating,
look behind you.

204
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,849
You'll find a whole new world.

205
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:44,563
Don't be a fool
that just stares at the sea.

206
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:48,025
I'm talking about my mom.

207
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:53,197
My father passed away while out at sea,
and my sister died while diving.

208
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,783
And my mom kept staring at the sea.

209
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,537
Had she just turned around,
she'd see me and Mount Halla.

210
00:18:01,872 --> 00:18:03,415
Had she turned around,

211
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,294
she wouldn't have had to see
the sea that consumed our family.

212
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,798
But she kept looking at the sea
and despising it.

213
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,935
Once Yeol moves here,
let's go to Mount Halla together.

214
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,437
We can talk about that then.

215
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:27,898
I told you. I only live in the present.

216
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:30,400
It's windy.

217
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,403
Come in soon. I'm going to nap.

218
00:18:59,847 --> 00:19:01,223
That damn…

219
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:09,314
Tollgate toward Seoul in one kilometer.

220
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,985
Why is she frowning in her sleep?

221
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:31,628
-Come back here when you're done.
-Okay.

222
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:42,472
SEOUL PYEONGMUN MARKET

223
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,600
Enjoy.

224
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,643
Thank you.

225
00:19:46,727 --> 00:19:47,728
Goodbye.

226
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,299
That fabric is high quality.
It's made in Korea.

227
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:20,844
-A 10 percent discount for 2,000.
-A 7 percent discount for 2,000.

228
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:26,850
Then how about eight percent?

229
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:27,976
Eight percent!

230
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,978
What a scumbag.

231
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,939
Watch what you say. I can hear you.

232
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,408
-Do you have any toy horses?
-No, we don't.

233
00:20:44,284 --> 00:20:47,371
-Do you have any toy horses?
-No, we don't.

234
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,049
-How many of each are you buying?
-I'm buying 200.

235
00:20:59,132 --> 00:21:01,677
An additional five-percent discount
in case I don't sell them all?

236
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,761
No, it's three percent.

237
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,596
Are you serious?

238
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,140
Fine. Five percent.

239
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,642
That's right.

240
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,479
-Is your leg feeling better?
-It's all right.

241
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,190
Why would you meet Yeol
without my permission?

242
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,943
Why do I need
your permission in the first place?

243
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:22,239
I only texted you
about meeting him out of courtesy.

244
00:21:22,322 --> 00:21:23,824
I don't need your permission.

245
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,746
You can meet him in two days
during the trial.

246
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,164
It doesn't matter.

247
00:21:31,790 --> 00:21:33,417
Today is his birthday.

248
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:36,962
Is there a toy shop nearby?

249
00:21:38,005 --> 00:21:39,172
No.

250
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,884
There's a family gathering tonight,
so come by tomorrow.

251
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,636
I'm coming by today.

252
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,513
I promised him I'd come.

253
00:21:46,596 --> 00:21:48,140
Are you taking your medication?

254
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,559
Why are you bringing that up?

255
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,608
Fine.

256
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:01,236
Drop him off at my parents' by 6 p.m.

257
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,197
-Make that 10 p.m.
-He goes to bed at 9 p.m.

258
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,367
Get him home by 8:50 p.m.

259
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,163
Hello.

260
00:22:16,835 --> 00:22:18,378
Did you buy your clothes?

261
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,091
You look upset. What's wrong?

262
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,847
Let me stop by the toy shop again.

263
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,229
What's going on?

264
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,815
I couldn't find a horse cushion.

265
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:40,776
Yeol is scared of the dark.

266
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:43,653
I wanted to give him one to hold onto,
but there were none.

267
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,031
I promised him I'd get him one.

268
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,034
Did you go to the bedding store
at the end of this line?

269
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,994
I did, but I just skimmed through.

270
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,704
I want to take a closer look.

271
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,791
FACTORY OUTLET
HYERIN BEDDINGS

272
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,877
That one looks like a horse.

273
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,462
Which one?

274
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,214
That one.

275
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:04,174
Where? Where's the horse cushion?

276
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:06,843
That brown one? There it is.

277
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,387
-It's in the very top corner.
-Right.

278
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,139
That's a horse's head, all right.

279
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:12,516
Can you get me that?

280
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,143
You're wrong.
That looks like a giraffe's head.

281
00:23:15,977 --> 00:23:18,730
How's that a giraffe's head?

282
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,150
A giraffe is yellow with brown spots.

283
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:26,154
That's completely brown.
That's not a giraffe.

284
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:29,157
And giraffes have horns on their heads.

285
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,788
Look. Giraffes have horns,
but that one doesn't.

286
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,458
That's obviously a horse's head,
not a giraffe's.

287
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,836
You're wrong. That's a giraffe's head.

288
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:43,213
I don't care. Please get it for me.

289
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:45,590
Goodness, I can't. I won't sell it.

290
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,592
My husband is out on delivery,
so I can't help you.

291
00:23:47,676 --> 00:23:50,011
Give me a ladder. I'll get it.

292
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,056
Jeez. The ladder is broken.

293
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,475
My husband needs to fix it.

294
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,688
Goodness.

295
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:10,657
Ma'am, can I borrow
your ladder for a minute?

296
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,743
-Sure. Make sure you bring it back.
-Thank you.

297
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:24,296
This ladder doesn't look too sturdy.

298
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:28,300
-Be careful.
-Jeez, you're going to great lengths

299
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,218
just to buy your kid a gift.

300
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:33,597
He's a precious boy. We got him
through artificial insemination.

301
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,436
Be careful.

302
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,814
Goodness, be careful.
The ladder doesn't look sturdy.

303
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,487
-Gosh, watch out!
-Watch out.

304
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:51,198
You're dropping everything.

305
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:54,743
Can you please be quiet?
I can't focus here.

306
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:57,996
Be careful.

307
00:24:59,831 --> 00:25:02,626
-Gosh.
-Watch out.

308
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,044
Jeez.

309
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:09,007
-I got it!
-Oh, my goodness!

310
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:11,801
I'm sorry.

311
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,429
Here's your horse.

312
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,852
HAEBYEOL PRESCHOOL

313
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:42,040
Are all the mothers like you?

314
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:44,793
Do they get dolled up for their kids?

315
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,712
You look like you're going on a date.

316
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,506
It's just lip balm.

317
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:55,512
I like Yeol
more than any guy in this world.

318
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,647
Why are you touching that?

319
00:26:06,356 --> 00:26:10,485
Touching my necklace helps me relax.

320
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:13,446
It helps me feel less tense.

321
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:16,950
Why are you tense about meeting your son?

322
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:20,912
We haven't met in a while.

323
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,542
I hope he still recognizes me.

324
00:26:27,877 --> 00:26:31,298
We've never been apart
for this long before.

325
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:34,301
Hey, get out. They're leaving.

326
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:46,062
Touch your necklace some more.
You're still too tense.

327
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,776
-Smile, will you?
-I'll call you later.

328
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:32,150
-Yeol.
-What? It's a horse.

329
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:33,943
Mom!

330
00:27:37,697 --> 00:27:39,366
I missed you.

331
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:27,580
Say hi to the stingray.

332
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,251
I still like horses more.

333
00:28:35,171 --> 00:28:37,424
Do you want to see a real horse?

334
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:38,675
Really?

335
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,803
Yes, really! Sit down.

336
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,404
Mom, did you ride a horse?

337
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,990
No, I wanted to ride with you later.

338
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,743
-You're the best.
-Am I?

339
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:11,458
The horses are huge.
They're bigger than you.

340
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,418
They're bigger than Dad too.

341
00:29:13,501 --> 00:29:14,836
Are they as big as mountains?

342
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,547
They're smaller than that.

343
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,175
But they're ten times bigger than you.

344
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:22,177
They're humongous.

345
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,847
Don't make me laugh.
You're just selling things.

346
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,767
Exactly. How successful
can he be on that island?

347
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,060
-Jeez.
-Are you looking down on me?

348
00:29:31,144 --> 00:29:33,980
Doing business there is different
from doing business on the mainland.

349
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,192
Being successful on an island
can't get you that much money.

350
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,986
Just eat this and stop bluffing.

351
00:29:40,570 --> 00:29:41,446
No, thanks.

352
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:45,116
What, I'm bluffing? You're ridiculous.

353
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,202
How much does
your chauffeuring business get you?

354
00:29:47,285 --> 00:29:48,828
A ton.

355
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,956
When business is good,
I earn ten million won a month.

356
00:29:54,834 --> 00:29:57,045
-Jeez.
-Jeju has turned you into a bluffer.

357
00:29:57,128 --> 00:30:00,381
Did I go too far?
You guys don't get paid in cash, do you?

358
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,343
All I have is cash.

359
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,178
-Let's see.
-He's right.

360
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:08,056
-Hey, let me hold it.
-Let me.

361
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,725
-Give me some allowance.
-Fine. This is on me.

362
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,769
-He has a ton.
-Eat up.

363
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:13,937
-Right.
-Here.

364
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:17,440
Come to Jeju when life gets tough.

365
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:19,484
There.

366
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,821
-Be healthy.
-Let's be healthy!

367
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:24,113
Let's be healthy!

368
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,788
Let's sing together
Even the parrots are singing

369
00:30:31,871 --> 00:30:35,416
Let's sing together like the rabbits

370
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,962
Gather around and sing together

371
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,423
Everybody, gather around

372
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:46,970
Let's sing and have some fun

373
00:30:47,053 --> 00:30:49,889
TAE-HUN

374
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:54,102
The cats are meowing…

375
00:30:54,769 --> 00:30:58,314
Tae-hun, call us when Yeol comes.
We're worried.

376
00:30:58,982 --> 00:31:00,066
I'm sorry.

377
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:02,235
-Please call us.
-I will.

378
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,070
Let's go.

379
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,013
CALL LOGS

380
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:31,055
SEON-A

381
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,518
The number you have dialed
is currently busy. Please leave--

382
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:39,939
Me? I'm waiting
at the address you gave me.

383
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:42,066
-Where are you?
-I'm almost there.

384
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,818
I'll be there soon.

385
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,549
I'm sorry for being late.
Can you get the toys?

386
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,502
Thank you.

387
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,509
-Give him to me.
-I'll take him to the front gate.

388
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,017
My parents, my brother, and his wife
waited to celebrate his birthday.

389
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:02,730
I said to come by 8:50 p.m.
You said you'd come by 10 p.m.

390
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,484
But it's almost 11 p.m. right now.
Do you know that?

391
00:33:08,069 --> 00:33:10,029
If you do this again after the trial ends,

392
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:11,906
I won't take it lightly.

393
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,576
Give him to me.

394
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,834
Can I spend the night with him

395
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,585
and bring him back tomorrow?

396
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:26,504
Give him to me.

397
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:28,715
If I win at the trial,

398
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:32,343
I'll let you see him whenever you want.

399
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,679
So let me take him tonight.

400
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,186
I can't trust you.

401
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,105
Just give him to me.

402
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:46,983
What if you don't come back?

403
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:51,487
Why wouldn't I?
I have to attend the trial.

404
00:33:52,071 --> 00:33:54,824
What if you get into another accident?
What will you do then?

405
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:57,869
Give him to me.

406
00:34:05,126 --> 00:34:08,212
-Mom.
-Yes. Come here.

407
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:13,051
-Yeol.
-That hurts!

408
00:34:13,634 --> 00:34:15,011
You're hurting him! Stop!

409
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:17,805
Yeol, come to me. Okay?

410
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:21,601
Come here.

411
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:24,812
Yeol, come to me. Okay?

412
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,779
Come here.

413
00:34:32,862 --> 00:34:35,281
Yeol, are you okay? Hang on.

414
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,784
-Let's go.
-Are you okay, Yeol?

415
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:43,164
-It's okay.
-Yeol.

416
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,500
Tae-hun, wait. Yeol.

417
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,169
-Hold on.
-You hurt his arm!

418
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:49,295
I'm taking him to the hospital.

419
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,007
Open the door.

420
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:53,966
Yeol.

421
00:34:54,634 --> 00:34:55,510
Yeol!

422
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,678
Open the door.

423
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,223
Can't you see he's crying in pain? Move!

424
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,391
Open up. Let me go with you.

425
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:06,646
Open up! Take me too!

426
00:35:06,729 --> 00:35:07,688
Go!

427
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,857
Open the door. Let me go with you!

428
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,693
Go! Hurry!

429
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,113
-That's enough.
-Tae-hun!

430
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,989
Let me go with you!

431
00:35:17,573 --> 00:35:19,033
Let me go with you!

432
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,119
Let me go with you.

433
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,114
What about your son?

434
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,744
He'll leave after getting the IV drip.

435
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,081
The doctor said he was a bit shaken up.

436
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,334
Did you not get to see him?

437
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:16,591
No.

438
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:20,344
He didn't want to see me.

439
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:23,681
Because I hurt him.

440
00:36:24,974 --> 00:36:26,225
He didn't want to.

441
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:42,742
You're staying at your old place, right?
Where is that?

442
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:12,688
Come on in. Have some water before you go.

443
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:15,441
Okay.

444
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:24,450
You must have been away for too long.
It's freezing.

445
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,077
Where's the thermostat?

446
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,913
It's on the wall.

447
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,494
-Dong-seok.
-Yes?

448
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,010
Get some sleep.

449
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,221
Call me after the trial.

450
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,767
I'll still be in Seoul,
shopping for some more items.

451
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,272
Where will you stay?

452
00:38:36,981 --> 00:38:37,982
Here.

453
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,276
I'm kidding.

454
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:44,071
There. Do you see that motel?

455
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:49,035
-Yes.
-I'll be there.

456
00:38:52,788 --> 00:38:53,873
Thanks.

457
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:02,131
If you lose at the trial tomorrow…

458
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,636
Never mind.

459
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:11,307
Let's worry about that tomorrow. Rest up.

460
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:06,941
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

461
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:26,043
Didn't you say Yeol was okay?

462
00:42:26,627 --> 00:42:27,836
You should've brought him.

463
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:34,009
I'm going to take him to Jeju
as soon as the trial ends.

464
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:36,637
You can send his belongings there.

465
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,566
I doubt I'll lose at the trial,
but I'll appeal if I do.

466
00:42:48,649 --> 00:42:49,733
And that's why

467
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:52,736
you won't be taking him to Jeju.

468
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:58,659
The judge has arrived. Please stand up.

469
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,624
Please sit down.

470
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:28,123
Let's eat. I'm hungry.

471
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,352
Are you really not going to eat?

472
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:50,145
No.

473
00:44:51,397 --> 00:44:53,649
You just lost at a trial.
It's not the end.

474
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,067
So eat up.

475
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:01,156
I'll be outside. You can eat.

476
00:45:40,404 --> 00:45:43,365
ILDONG RESTAURANT
HANGOVER SOUP

477
00:45:45,242 --> 00:45:46,618
You said you'd appeal.

478
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,122
You can win then and go to Jeju together.
What's the problem?

479
00:45:51,748 --> 00:45:54,418
What's been on your mind all this time?

480
00:45:55,752 --> 00:45:57,671
-Yeol.
-What about him?

481
00:45:59,756 --> 00:46:03,594
What if he doesn't like me anymore?
What if he despises me?

482
00:46:04,344 --> 00:46:06,388
What if he never wants to see me again?

483
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,683
-Then call and ask him.
-No. I'm too scared.

484
00:46:11,351 --> 00:46:12,936
What if it's true?

485
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:16,940
Then what will you do?
Where are you going?

486
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:19,359
To the ends of the earth?

487
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,825
My head hurts.

488
00:46:29,203 --> 00:46:31,288
He's the only thing on my mind.

489
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:33,832
I can't think about anything else.

490
00:46:33,916 --> 00:46:35,209
Just try.

491
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,878
-I can't.
-You're too fixated on that thought.

492
00:46:38,795 --> 00:46:40,214
Think about appealing,

493
00:46:40,297 --> 00:46:41,840
hiring a better lawyer,

494
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:44,968
or the house you'll be living in together.

495
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,305
There are tons of things
you can think about.

496
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,644
I can't do it.

497
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,189
I want to, but I can't.

498
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:59,816
-You can.
-No, I can't.

499
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:04,363
Help me.

500
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,422
Not like this.

501
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,845
Fine, I'll help you. Follow me.

502
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:39,147
Just focus on the game
like you did when you were little.

503
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,941
Focus on winning the game like I am.

504
00:47:41,525 --> 00:47:43,819
Don't think of anything else.

505
00:47:49,324 --> 00:47:50,200
Again.

506
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:34,745
I want to have a walk.

507
00:48:35,495 --> 00:48:36,788
You can go first.

508
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:38,874
I'll drop you off. Get in my truck.

509
00:48:39,666 --> 00:48:40,667
I want to walk.

510
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:42,836
Enough is enough.

511
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,673
Why are you being so self-destructive?

512
00:48:47,299 --> 00:48:48,675
You bawled in the car

513
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:51,261
for hours on end.

514
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:54,723
It's about time
you snapped out of it and had a meal.

515
00:48:55,974 --> 00:48:57,309
You didn't even drink water.

516
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,521
You should fight to live
for your son's sake.

517
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,441
Don't talk like my ex-husband

518
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:07,194
or like my mom.

519
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:13,825
Don't tell me to stop being sad

520
00:49:14,409 --> 00:49:16,787
or to overcome my struggles!

521
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:20,582
I'm only being like this

522
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:23,210
because I can't help it.

523
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,757
Do I look pathetic?

524
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:33,804
Then just leave. Like my mom did.

525
00:49:34,888 --> 00:49:36,640
Like Tae-hun did.

526
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:38,600
I won't stop you.

527
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:41,687
So just let me be!

528
00:49:42,854 --> 00:49:45,232
-Just let me be!
-And what? Let you die?

529
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:46,817
Yes!

530
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,365
Fine, do as you please. You fucking brat.

531
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:59,454
I wouldn't want to live too
if I were in your shoes.

532
00:50:00,872 --> 00:50:03,792
Your mom was selfish enough
to abandon you when you were little.

533
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,461
Your dad's business went under,
and he committed suicide.

534
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,255
Your husband divorced you.

535
00:50:09,131 --> 00:50:10,716
You're depressed and even lost your son.

536
00:50:10,799 --> 00:50:13,343
Of course, you wouldn't have an appetite.

537
00:50:14,594 --> 00:50:17,973
You'd find no joy in life.

538
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:19,641
Do whatever you want.

539
00:50:20,976 --> 00:50:25,856
Keep living like this.
Who cares if you die?

540
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,735
Then later in the future…

541
00:50:31,445 --> 00:50:33,321
Like mother, like son.

542
00:50:33,405 --> 00:50:36,450
Your son will end up like you too.

543
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:39,244
Am I wrong?

544
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,874
His dad left his mom
due to her depression.

545
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,459
His mom always cried

546
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,670
and never looked happy
until the day she died.

547
00:50:49,963 --> 00:50:53,467
So how would you expect him
to find joy in his life?

548
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:58,054
He'll end up being
self-destructive or suicidal

549
00:50:58,138 --> 00:50:59,765
just like his mom was.

550
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:04,936
He'll just blame his life
and be depressed.

551
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:09,900
Or he'll live recklessly like me.

552
00:51:57,906 --> 00:51:59,825
I'm not telling you not to be sad.

553
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,246
Just don't be sad
all the time like my mom.

554
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:08,041
You can feel sad and cry.

555
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:13,004
But make sure you eat
and sleep too. Damn it.

556
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:17,133
At times, smile and be happy.

557
00:52:18,969 --> 00:52:20,720
It's already infuriating

558
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:23,223
that you can't live with your child.

559
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:27,060
But if you also become self-destructive,

560
00:52:27,143 --> 00:52:29,771
what good will come out of that?

561
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,483
Get up if you're done crying.

562
00:53:17,694 --> 00:53:18,862
Let's walk.

563
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,100
You know I'm stupid.

564
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,603
So explain it to me in layman's terms.

565
00:53:51,686 --> 00:53:53,855
How does it feel when you're depressed?

566
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,192
It's hard to explain.

567
00:53:58,193 --> 00:53:59,444
Just give it a shot.

568
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,075
Let's see.

569
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:11,498
It feels like a drenched blanket
is covering my entire body.

570
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:18,463
And everything is dark.

571
00:54:20,173 --> 00:54:22,884
Despite all those lights,

572
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:25,387
I can't see any of them

573
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,306
when I'm depressed.

574
00:54:30,058 --> 00:54:31,518
It's all black.

575
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,812
Does this happen often?

576
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:36,648
Every now and then.

577
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,819
It's nothing serious.
It's just an illusion.

578
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:47,117
Why are you smiling?
I'm right. None of that is real.

579
00:54:47,826 --> 00:54:50,370
How can it be dark
when there are so many lights?

580
00:54:52,372 --> 00:54:56,334
Next time it happens,
tell yourself that it's an illusion.

581
00:54:56,418 --> 00:55:00,797
Just think that you're not of sound mind.

582
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,091
Or call me right away.

583
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,343
Then I'll say,

584
00:55:05,427 --> 00:55:09,014
"Wake up, you brat!
It's all in your head!"

585
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,227
Is it incurable?

586
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,564
No.

587
00:55:18,523 --> 00:55:20,275
The doctor said it can be cured.

588
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,237
I'm going to get therapy soon.

589
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:29,284
Maybe just taking
the medication isn't working.

590
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:32,162
Good. Do everything you can.

591
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:35,665
It's so bright out here even at night.

592
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:40,253
How frightening would it be
if you see nothing but darkness?

593
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,966
Do everything you can.

594
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,385
Take medication and get therapy.

595
00:55:48,636 --> 00:55:49,763
Do you have money?

596
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:53,016
Let me know if you don't.

597
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:57,645
Why are you smiling? Do I look poor?

598
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:01,191
I'm just grateful.

599
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,736
Then will you go out with me?

600
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,656
Not that grateful?

601
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,326
Gosh.

602
00:56:26,007 --> 00:56:27,967
-What are you doing?
-Working.

603
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:30,136
What exactly?

604
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:32,430
I'm listening to my recording.

605
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:35,683
Put this on.

606
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:42,065
Frying pan.

607
00:56:43,358 --> 00:56:47,362
Pliers, hammers, and screwdrivers.
All kinds of tools.

608
00:56:48,154 --> 00:56:51,658
Pliers, hammers, and screwdrivers.
All kinds of tools.

609
00:56:53,159 --> 00:56:56,204
Tops and shorts.

610
00:56:56,788 --> 00:56:59,332
Tops and shorts.

611
00:56:59,415 --> 00:57:00,542
Here.

612
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,670
I need to remove "tops and shorts"

613
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:06,047
and add the new items that I bought.

614
00:57:11,386 --> 00:57:13,930
Pink skirts. Flower-patterned skirts.

615
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,016
Padded chairs. Farming seat cushions.

616
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:20,186
Rubber shoes. Flower-patterned boots.

617
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:22,689
Darn it. Hey.

618
00:57:24,691 --> 00:57:26,776
I recorded your laughter too.

619
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,027
This is so hilarious.

620
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:39,038
Pink skirts. Flower-patterned skirts.

621
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,542
Padded chairs. Farming seat cushions.

622
00:57:42,625 --> 00:57:44,878
-Rubber shoes--
-It didn't record your laughter.

623
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,963
You're laughing an awful lot.

624
00:57:47,547 --> 00:57:48,965
What's so funny?

625
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:52,343
-Do you want to hear it again?
-Yes.

626
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,805
Pink skirts. Flower-patterned skirts…

627
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:12,405
I want to be happy.

628
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,241
I really do.

629
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,246
Me too.

630
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:22,540
A ton.

631
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:28,254
I truly want to be happy.

632
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,868
How's it going with Yeong-ok?

633
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:44,122
What do you mean? It's just a day trip.

634
00:59:44,205 --> 00:59:45,290
Are you sulking?

635
00:59:46,457 --> 00:59:47,584
We have…

636
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:50,420
an extremely emotional bond.

637
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:52,839
Take this.

638
00:59:52,922 --> 00:59:55,883
Safely escort our princess
to the mid-mountains, okay?

639
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:57,635
After you, Princess.

640
01:00:00,263 --> 01:00:02,724
We look like a completely ordinary couple.

641
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:05,184
Like those who have
moved in together or are dating.

642
01:00:06,644 --> 01:00:07,854
Let's not be serious.

643
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,148
Hello?

644
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:16,321
