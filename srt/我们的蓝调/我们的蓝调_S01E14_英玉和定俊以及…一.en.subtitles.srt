1
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,112
YEONG-OK AND JEONG-JUN

2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,700
A CAPTAIN AND A HAENYEO TRY NOT TO BE
SERIOUS AMIDST LIES AND RUMORS

3
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:02,062
-Hairtail. 3 for 50,000 won.
-Hairtail.

4
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,189
Squid, 3 for 10,000 won.
Hairtail, 3 for 50,000 won.

5
00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:06,399
-Just add some salt.
-Take a look.

6
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:09,611
-We have hairtail!
-Three for you.

7
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:10,820
We have cuttlefish too.

8
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,114
Don't rinse it in tap water. Here.

9
00:01:13,865 --> 00:01:15,366
See you again.

10
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,660
Hey. Take over.

11
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:43,061
Ms. Jung, where are you going?

12
00:01:43,144 --> 00:01:45,688
-We're busy right now. Ms. Jung!
-Ms. Jung!

13
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,411
That brat.

14
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,790
What? I have no loyalty?

15
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:06,626
Damn it.

16
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,554
I thought she'd come by to say goodbye.

17
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,472
She must've been quite busy.

18
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,892
At least we saw her once.

19
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,980
She doesn't need to see us
wrinkly women twice.

20
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,358
I feel bad for Mi-ran.

21
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,360
Be good to her.

22
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:35,738
Why do you feel bad for her?

23
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:39,284
She meets various men,
and her daughter is with her ex-husband.

24
00:02:40,785 --> 00:02:45,081
The fact that she can't settle down
makes me pity her.

25
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:50,962
There's no one she can truly rely on.

26
00:02:53,006 --> 00:02:56,426
And it must break her heart
that she can't raise her own daughter.

27
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,556
Eun-hui has never been a mom,
so she wouldn't understand.

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:05,727
Ji-yun was too ashamed to tell her fiancé

29
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,646
that her mom had divorced many times.

30
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:12,734
She likes her stepmom even more
since the latter is a professor.

31
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,780
It must've broken her heart that Ji-yun
didn't want her to join the world trip.

32
00:03:19,324 --> 00:03:23,745
She should have stayed here
until she felt better.

33
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,541
Did Ji-yun really not want
her mom to come?

34
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,711
Was it not because Mi-ran was too busy?

35
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:33,713
Of course not.

36
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,800
She closed her shop,
thinking she'd be going on that trip.

37
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:39,844
Did you not know that?

38
00:03:45,475 --> 00:03:50,813
Mi-ran didn't tell you about this
because you seemed too busy with work

39
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,816
and had a lot on your mind.

40
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:58,947
She said she didn't want
to burden you even more.

41
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,574
She told us not to tell you

42
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:04,160
and even shed some tears.

43
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,293
ABANG SUNDAE

44
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,628
Hey, Eun-hui!

45
00:04:14,212 --> 00:04:15,546
Myeong-bo left his house!

46
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,174
He went to his parents' house.

47
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,594
Apparently, In-jeong
had been physically abusing him.

48
00:04:22,178 --> 00:04:24,722
Even their daughter told him
that he should divorce her.

49
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:25,932
Shocking, right?

50
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,060
Let me tell you what's even more shocking.
He just called me.

51
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:30,979
He's really elated.

52
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,772
He said Mi-ran was his lifesaver.

53
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,027
Hey, by the way…

54
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:41,239
Is Mi-ran at your place?

55
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:44,659
-No, she left.
-Jeez. Good riddance.

56
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,999
Let's be honest. She's a nuisance.

57
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,876
It's a nuisance
if she overstays her welcome.

58
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,878
Aren't you glad she left?

59
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:59,007
I bet you'll say the same thing about me.

60
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,467
Hey, you're different from her.

61
00:05:01,551 --> 00:05:03,720
Imagine if you were gone for just a day.

62
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:06,806
I, Ho-sik, Myeong-bo, Seong-bae,
Ms. Kang, Ms. Hyeon,

63
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:10,310
Yeong-ok, Dal-i, Byeol-i,
Jeong-jun, and Dong-seok will all panic.

64
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,561
You little…

65
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,690
Mi-ran is like a fleeting breeze.

66
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:18,318
You're our pillar.

67
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,362
She's just one of the stops we pass by.

68
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,948
But you're our last stop.

69
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:12,246
Mi-ran has cut ties with me for good.

70
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:15,792
But I don't feel…

71
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,465
Let me tell you something
as someone who knows you best

72
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:06,759
and has known you forever.

73
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:09,303
You see,

74
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:13,891
you're not that much of a loyal friend.

75
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,577
What? I have no loyalty?

76
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,287
Damn it.

77
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:38,666
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

78
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,424
How dare she?

79
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,929
MI-RAN

80
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:59,228
The number you have called
cannot be reached.

81
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,938
Please leave a message…

82
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:08,279
Mr. Min, I'm going to Seoul.

83
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,239
Take care of the store for me.

84
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:29,008
Good work. Here.

85
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,639
Things are finally going as planned
now that you're back.

86
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:37,600
It was so hectic while you were gone.

87
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:39,894
Just take over this shop again.

88
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:41,687
I said no.

89
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,609
I'm going to work part-time here
for two months and get good money.

90
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:50,488
Then I'm off to Iceland
to see the auroras.

91
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:56,410
Good luck, sir,
if you want to keep the sales up.

92
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:59,580
Right. Go to room seven.

93
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:03,417
I'm an administrator.
I only take care of VVIPs.

94
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:04,710
Send someone else.

95
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:10,341
She's a super VVIP. Happy?

96
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,052
What? Hey, who is she?

97
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:15,179
Hey!

98
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,890
That little…

99
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:35,324
I'm sorry for being late.

100
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,564
This is a little hot.

101
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,161
How am I

102
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,997
disloyal?

103
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:28,085
Are you here to argue?

104
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,632
And to return your necklace.

105
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:39,263
Just say what you need to say.
You can still talk.

106
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,852
You're the disloyal one, you brat.

107
00:10:48,189 --> 00:10:51,359
You always looked down on me.

108
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,571
You treated me like your maid.

109
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,408
It happened…

110
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,912
a year ago.

111
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,624
After your third divorce,

112
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,587
I couldn't reach you and was worried sick.

113
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:14,507
So I rushed all the way

114
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,593
from Jeju to Seoul.

115
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,099
And…

116
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:28,521
you told your friends while drunk…

117
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:33,526
What did I say

118
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,278
to them?

119
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,574
That I was

120
00:11:41,492 --> 00:11:43,077
always at your beck and call.

121
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:45,746
And that I was…

122
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,208
the biggest doormat ever.

123
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:56,841
How dare you think of me as your minion?

124
00:11:57,883 --> 00:11:59,218
Your maid?

125
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,304
Your slave?

126
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:05,182
You're none of them.

127
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,979
But you are a doormat.

128
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,856
What did you say?

129
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,151
Hey.

130
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:17,069
You brat.

131
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:19,947
Who else in this world…

132
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,410
could I consider…

133
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,997
a doormat?

134
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,642
My family…

135
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,563
hates and feels embarrassed
that I'm a divorcée.

136
00:12:54,148 --> 00:12:55,566
Even my own daughter

137
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,069
feels distant like a mother-in-law.

138
00:13:01,071 --> 00:13:03,240
So is it that wrong

139
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,702
that I at least think of you

140
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:11,207
as a doormat
or someone I'm comfortable with?

141
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:12,917
You brat.

142
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:26,388
Ho-sik told me

143
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:30,226
about how I had treated you
when we were young.

144
00:13:33,604 --> 00:13:34,897
He said

145
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,400
that I had called you a moocher.

146
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:43,197
So I told him this.

147
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,992
"I don't remember that well
since I was little."

148
00:13:47,493 --> 00:13:50,746
"But if I really said that,
I must've been crazy…

149
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,708
and shallow."

150
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,383
How am I disloyal?

151
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,885
It's true.

152
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,595
Damn it…

153
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,058
Had you been truly loyal,

154
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:14,353
you would've confronted me
and said you were hurt

155
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,854
just like you are right now.

156
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:20,818
And if I didn't acknowledge my mistake
and refused to apologize,

157
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,279
you should've ripped my hair out
like In-jeong did.

158
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:26,782
That's what a loyal friend
would've done, you brat.

159
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:30,077
What kind of a loyal friend

160
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:34,123
holds a grudge like a stranger would?

161
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,043
Don't you agree?

162
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:41,255
It's true that you're not loyal.

163
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,340
Right?

164
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,802
Whatever.

165
00:14:48,137 --> 00:14:50,097
I'm too busy with work as it is.

166
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:53,142
I wouldn't come to Seoul
just to rip your hair out.

167
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,229
Then why did you come?

168
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,693
That's because

169
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,362
I didn't feel good

170
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,741
after throwing away
our friendship, you idiot.

171
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:36,185
You are…

172
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,604
a loyal friend.

173
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:51,909
Hey.

174
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,120
Your body is stiff as a rock.

175
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:59,291
At this rate…

176
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,964
You could suffer a stroke.

177
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,632
Or a brain disease.

178
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:11,679
What's your schedule today, ma'am?

179
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,348
Are you headed straight to Jeju?

180
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:18,227
Hey, I would need at least two days

181
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,813
to vent my grudge.

182
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:22,856
I can't go to Jeju tonight.

183
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,609
I'm leaving in two days.

184
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,779
So brace yourself.

185
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:31,240
I'm going to go all-out.

186
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:33,450
Sure.

187
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:39,206
Since you have a lot of free time,
how about a full-course massage?

188
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:43,961
Ma'am.

189
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,297
Your body is so stiff…

190
00:16:49,258 --> 00:16:53,387
that I wouldn't have let you go today
even if you wanted to.

191
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,808
Jeez.

192
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:03,939
I thought you had it easy
and worked behind the counter.

193
00:17:07,693 --> 00:17:10,738
You think I would've had it easy
doing this job after college?

194
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,782
Don't make me laugh.

195
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,954
You have a strong grip.

196
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,544
Didn't you see me grab
In-jeong's hair the other day?

197
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:34,887
Did it hurt when I slapped you?

198
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:38,182
Come out so I can slap you back for it.

199
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:42,644
Stop talking and take a nap.

200
00:17:46,523 --> 00:17:47,733
To be honest,

201
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,402
I had no more to say

202
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:53,113
to Mi-ran.

203
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:57,618
The moment

204
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:02,539
her tender yet strong hands
touched my stiff back,

205
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,001
I just knew.

206
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:11,715
Her family may still be alive.

207
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,385
She may have had three ex-husbands

208
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,846
whom she used to be close with.

209
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:22,017
She may have a precious daughter.

210
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:24,311
But I realized

211
00:18:25,062 --> 00:18:29,608
that I was the only one she could
truly rely on and be comfortable with

212
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:32,027
in this terrifying world.

213
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:39,493
Since I had no parents,
husband, or children,

214
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,537
it hit me even harder.

215
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:44,540
I realized that she was the only one

216
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:47,709
who could truly understand me.

217
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:51,839
-You ordered so much.
-That night,

218
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:54,550
-Wait. A photo.
-we made a new memory

219
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:58,220
-that was carved in our hearts.
-Just take one.

220
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,680
Take one with me.

221
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,682
It's only fun for you since you're pretty.

222
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:02,891
But I'm--

223
00:19:03,892 --> 00:19:05,144
Loyalty.

224
00:19:05,811 --> 00:19:07,312
Fine, I'll be late for my flight.

225
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,772
-Let's take one.
-Wait.

226
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,360
Why are you laughing?

227
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:18,115
-What?
-Ta-da.

228
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,283
My gosh.

229
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,245
I got you the same one as mine.

230
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:29,835
Jeez. But I sweat a lot.

231
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,171
-Loyalty.
-Loyalty!

232
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,842
All right. Until the day we meet again.

233
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:39,636
Say cheese.

234
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,846
Wait.

235
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:42,723
What is it?

236
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,810
Are you hurt again
since I'm doing this my way?

237
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:50,439
-Is that funny?
-Is that not? You little…

238
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:53,775
Next time I hurt you, promise me
you'll come and rip my hair out.

239
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:55,235
I promise.

240
00:19:56,737 --> 00:19:57,821
Say cheese.

241
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,698
Make a lovely expression!

242
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:03,869
Like we're teenagers.

243
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:12,794
YEONG-OK, JEONG-JUN, AND YEONG-HUI 1

244
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,490
You'll trip and fall. Don't run.

245
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,623
Yeong-hui, come out.

246
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:50,791
Yes, ma'am.

247
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:16,692
When I entered the alley

248
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:23,240
-My heart was racing
-My heart was racing

249
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:28,287
-The curtains were drawn
-The curtains were drawn

250
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:32,207
-In front of your window
-In front of your window

251
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:36,753
-I just stared at them in silence
-I just stared at them in silence

252
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,887
Two iced coffees and a cheesecake, please.

253
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:50,225
Two iced coffees.

254
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:54,146
And one cheesecake?

255
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,319
Eighteen thousand?

256
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:04,573
Sir, that'll be 18,000 won.

257
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,575
Eighteen thousand won.

258
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:15,584
-Can I have the card, please?
-Thank you.

259
00:22:18,128 --> 00:22:20,547
-Bye, Ms. Oh.
-See you later.

260
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,842
I'll come to pick you up
in two hours once your shift is over.

261
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,678
Hello.

262
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:33,518
What would you like?

263
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,105
One mocha latte and a pecan pie, please.

264
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:40,984
One mocha latte and…

265
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,112
One mocha latte and a walnut pie.

266
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:48,116
One mocha latte and a walnut pie?

267
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:25,946
Today is October 21st.

268
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:28,490
You said you'd come to visit me.

269
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,034
So why aren't you here?
Are you coming at night?

270
00:23:31,118 --> 00:23:32,494
I'm busy with work.

271
00:23:33,161 --> 00:23:35,372
I'll visit next month on the first Sunday.

272
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:48,885
I'LL VISIT NEXT MONTH ON THE FIRST SUNDAY

273
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:51,221
You always say "next month."

274
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:53,014
That's all you say.

275
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,767
In January,
you said you'd come in February.

276
00:23:56,476 --> 00:23:59,187
In June, you said you'd come in July.

277
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,908
If you don't come here,

278
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:14,578
I'll go to you.

279
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:33,096
Hooray!

280
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,973
Hooray!

281
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:05,337
My heart was racing

282
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:09,633
The curtains were drawn
In front of your window

283
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:10,717
Where are you headed?

284
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:15,597
I was a fool who couldn't say anything

285
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,016
-Ma'am!
-On my way back--

286
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,602
How many times must I ask you?

287
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,355
Where is your destination?

288
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,485
Jeju. Seogwipo.

289
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:32,072
Pureung. Yeong-ok's house.

290
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:12,779
HAJEONG PATROL DIVISION

291
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,961
STAY BED AND BREAKFAST

292
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:34,778
I love you

293
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,197
I love you

294
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,034
I know I don't deserve you

295
00:27:43,536 --> 00:27:45,205
I will forever…

296
00:28:06,226 --> 00:28:07,102
You're pretty.

297
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,616
You're handsome.

298
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:26,162
Bye.

299
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:04,659
MS. JANG

300
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,044
MISSED CALL
MS. JANG

301
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:29,267
MS. JANG

302
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:32,228
Yeong-hui is flying to Jeju
tomorrow at 2 p.m.

303
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,022
Pick her up around 3 p.m.

304
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,496
Ms. Jang, you called.

305
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,500
I couldn't pick up
because I was working late.

306
00:29:54,083 --> 00:29:57,629
But what do you mean,
Yeong-hui's coming to Jeju Island?

307
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:01,257
Did she insist on coming here?

308
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:02,759
That's not good.

309
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:05,804
I need to harvest,
so I won't be around to take care of her.

310
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,223
There's nowhere she can stay either.

311
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,684
Yeong-hui. Guys.

312
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,854
Ji-hun is sleeping, so be quiet.

313
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:17,398
You're packing up so well.

314
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,861
Make sure you zip them up.

315
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:26,157
Now, go to your rooms and sleep tight.

316
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,700
-Okay.
-High-five.

317
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,870
-Good night.
-Night.

318
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,039
Good night.

319
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,459
Ms. Jang, can I speak with her?

320
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,002
I'll dissuade her from coming.

321
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,463
It's not about her.

322
00:30:40,964 --> 00:30:45,468
They're going to renovate
and repair the facilities.

323
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:50,265
So everyone needs to go
back home for the next week.

324
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,350
I'm no exception.

325
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,315
Put your suitcase up.

326
00:31:02,277 --> 00:31:05,321
Well done. Good night.

327
00:31:27,594 --> 00:31:30,597
Ms. Jang,
I'm sorry I can't help every time.

328
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:35,310
But I'm in no situation to take her in.

329
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:40,481
Haenyeos can't take leaves
like other jobs.

330
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:43,526
We need to move as a group.

331
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,779
Plus, the tide time has changed recently.

332
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:49,073
-So I'm working early--
-Yeong-ok.

333
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,160
I understand your situation.

334
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,957
Then could you ask your mother

335
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:01,377
to take care of her
for the time being like she did last time?

336
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:03,963
Yeong-hui likes her,

337
00:32:04,047 --> 00:32:06,507
and she always liked Yeong-hui too.

338
00:32:06,591 --> 00:32:09,135
My mother has had dementia
for a very long time.

339
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,846
She's with my brother in Jeonju.

340
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,724
It's been a while
since I've last seen her,

341
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,226
so I'm going to visit her.

342
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,981
Yeong-ok, she's not like
how she used to be.

343
00:32:22,065 --> 00:32:25,944
She's more disciplined
and much more social.

344
00:32:26,027 --> 00:32:27,904
She can even take the subway alone.

345
00:32:28,488 --> 00:32:30,740
She's no longer schizophrenic either.

346
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,617
I know she's recovered.

347
00:32:37,705 --> 00:32:39,874
Then I'll go to Seoul.

348
00:32:41,918 --> 00:32:44,379
I won't be diving next Monday.

349
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,715
Today is Thursday, so in three days--

350
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,802
The arrival time is 3 p.m.
Make sure you're there.

351
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,262
If you don't show up,

352
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:56,432
the flight attendants will be flustered.

353
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:58,893
And Yeong-hui will be disappointed.

354
00:32:59,727 --> 00:33:00,979
Bye.

355
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,660
YEONG-OK

356
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:23,209
Yeong-hui.

357
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,007
I'd like to see your drawing too.

358
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,552
Don't pick up.

359
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,347
Surprise her in Jeju.
That way, she'll be happier.

360
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:39,142
Keep drawing.

361
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,643
Good night, Painter Lee.

362
00:33:41,394 --> 00:33:44,022
I'm Artist Lee.

363
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:47,233
All right. Artist Lee.

364
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:51,487
Good night. Don't draw until late.

365
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:49,212
CAPTAIN JEONG-JUN

366
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:53,424
I love you

367
00:34:53,508 --> 00:34:55,760
I love you

368
00:34:55,843 --> 00:35:00,181
I know I don't deserve you

369
00:35:00,264 --> 00:35:01,349
While living--

370
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,350
I'll stop singing.

371
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:06,938
Ta-da.

372
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,481
NEWLY-BUILT APARTMENT HOUSE FOR SALE

373
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,400
If I get a 100-million-won loan,

374
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,863
I could get
this 20-pyeong apartment house.

375
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:17,740
Two bedrooms and one bathroom.

376
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,618
It's mostly furnished.

377
00:35:20,701 --> 00:35:24,038
There's an ocean view
and you can even see Mount Halla.

378
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,749
Take a look at this house
that I want to buy.

379
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,543
Tell me if you like it too.

380
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:30,294
If you don't, I won't buy it.

381
00:35:31,337 --> 00:35:32,713
We're grown adults.

382
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:33,881
Well…

383
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,384
Who knows? We could get married.

384
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,845
But don't get me wrong.

385
00:35:38,928 --> 00:35:42,348
I'm not pressuring you
to marry me at this moment.

386
00:35:42,431 --> 00:35:43,599
It's just that

387
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,937
I'm going out with you
hoping to marry you one day.

388
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:51,107
My feelings are sincere. That's all.

389
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,444
Right. I told my parents
that I had a girlfriend,

390
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:56,904
and they wanted to meet you.

391
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,742
Let's just have a casual meal with them
when you don't have to work.

392
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:04,620
Good night. I love you.

393
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:06,539
Salute.

394
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:25,600
I love you

395
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,185
I love you

396
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:32,356
I know I don't deserve you

397
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:33,524
While living--

398
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:34,859
I'll stop singing.

399
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:39,197
Ta-da.

400
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:25,368
Where is Gi-jun?

401
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,080
He's checking out the fixed nets.

402
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:33,584
Did something good happen?

403
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:36,003
Yes.

404
00:37:36,504 --> 00:37:38,381
I guess things are looking up
for you and Yeong-ok.

405
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,594
I'm jealous!

406
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,057
I'm lonely.

407
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,068
What are we having for dinner?

408
00:37:59,151 --> 00:38:00,945
We're having jajangmyeon.

409
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:02,530
Yeong-ok, hurry up.

410
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,864
But I wanted to have pasta.

411
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,449
But I like jajangmyeon.

412
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,535
-Jeez.
-Hurry up!

413
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:09,328
Goodness.

414
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,498
-The weather is great.
-It sure is.

415
00:38:12,581 --> 00:38:16,085
Goodness. Look at you guys.

416
00:38:16,168 --> 00:38:18,921
-I feel great today.
-Gosh.

417
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,507
-I feel great too.
-Me too.

418
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,969
-Hello. Be careful.
-Hey. Okay.

419
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,346
-Did you sleep well?
-Yes.

420
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,348
Take good care of Hye-ja.

421
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,225
Did you go home early?

422
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,769
-Yes.
-I'm full.

423
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,938
Do well today.

424
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,398
The tide is looking good.

425
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:39,900
-You're right.
-Right.

426
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,402
-Hello.
-Hey.

427
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,283
Where is Ms. Hyeon?

428
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,368
-She's peeing.
-I see.

429
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,708
-Goodness.
-Hello.

430
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:57,293
-Please do well today.
-Okay.

431
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:59,920
-Goodness.
-Hop in.

432
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,172
Okay.

433
00:39:31,994 --> 00:39:35,247
I said I didn't want
our relationship to become serious.

434
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:39,293
It's not because it's you.
I don't have plans to ever get married.

435
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,421
In that case,
I wouldn't need to meet your parents.

436
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:46,092
Dating with marriage in mind
makes me uncomfortable.

437
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:49,220
Let's pretend like we never dated
and let's just go back

438
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,097
to being captain and haenyeo.

439
00:39:51,722 --> 00:39:54,183
Just so you know, I hate clingy men.

440
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:13,035
Why do you look so down?
You were smiling just until a while ago.

441
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,611
Here.

442
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,613
There you go.

443
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,687
It's not time yet.

444
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,732
I told you
you didn't have to come so early.

445
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:32,198
Look at you pretending.

446
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,368
-Goodness. This is heavy.
-Be careful.

447
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:39,246
-Jeez.
-It's so heavy.

448
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,971
All right.

449
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:58,474
Goodness.

450
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,020
Why is your catch so small?

451
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,480
Don't be ridiculous.

452
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,815
She would've died had she been greedier.

453
00:42:07,441 --> 00:42:09,944
Jeez. I bet Hye-ja resurfaced

454
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,071
and Yeong-ok had to catch
20kg all by herself.

455
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,697
Yeong-ok, partner up with me.

456
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,367
I like Hye-ja.

457
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,578
Hye-ja must have tamed her.

458
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:21,205
She's my minion now.

459
00:42:21,789 --> 00:42:23,207
-Right?
-I am.

460
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:27,044
-Goodness.
-Goodness.

461
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,255
That's so true.

462
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,673
Let's go.

463
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,341
Goodness.

464
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:33,884
-Gosh.
-That's funny.

465
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:35,886
Please take good care of her.

466
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:37,805
I will.

467
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:43,102
I'm going

468
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:46,605
to meet

469
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:48,857
my twin sister.

470
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,652
Her name is Yeong-ok.

471
00:42:52,695 --> 00:42:53,862
I see.

472
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:12,298
The toilet is over there.

473
00:43:12,965 --> 00:43:16,427
If you need my help,
just press this button.

474
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:22,516
Please sit down.

475
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,899
When will

476
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:35,529
this plane fly?

477
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,282
We'll be leaving in 20 minutes.

478
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:41,577
I'll let you know
when we're about to depart.

479
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:45,039
-Okay.
-Let me fasten your seat belt.

480
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,086
Don't hide your disability card.

481
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,505
Hang it around your neck
so people can see.

482
00:43:54,423 --> 00:43:56,467
Dear passengers,
the plane will take off soon.

483
00:43:56,550 --> 00:44:00,888
Please make sure
that your seat belts are fastened.

484
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,097
Thank you.

485
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,477
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

486
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:29,249
I'll drop off the catch
at the union and go there.

487
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,293
Wait for me. Let's talk in person.

488
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:42,471
Please drive the ladies home today.
I'm a bit busy.

489
00:44:42,554 --> 00:44:46,016
They're salting fish today.
We don't need to drop them off.

490
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,559
That's good.

491
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:00,572
YEONG-OK

492
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,746
Why have you been down all day?

493
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,167
Tell me. We're not even on the highway,
but you're speeding.

494
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:17,005
That's Yeong-ok's car.

495
00:45:29,351 --> 00:45:30,978
Jeong-jun! Darn it.

496
00:46:00,716 --> 00:46:02,926
I told you to wait for me there.

497
00:46:03,594 --> 00:46:04,887
Did you not get my text?

498
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,347
I'm headed to the airport.
Let's talk later.

499
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,516
Later when?

500
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:13,061
A week from now on?

501
00:46:17,941 --> 00:46:20,235
We can talk on your way to the airport.

502
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:28,327
Fine. You can follow with your car.

503
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,412
I'll go then.
Step aside so you won't get hurt.

504
00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:52,226
Get out.

505
00:46:53,352 --> 00:46:54,478
Here?

506
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,941
If you need to talk with her,
do that later.

507
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:03,070
It's not the end of the world,
and you live nearby. Talk to her later.

508
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:05,364
How could you tell me to walk from here?

509
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,575
I'm so flustered
that my accent is coming out.

510
00:47:17,292 --> 00:47:18,418
Get out.

511
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:20,963
Jeong-jun, let's just go!

512
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,384
Jeez…

513
00:47:37,437 --> 00:47:38,438
Hey.

514
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,023
Do you really love her that much?

515
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:41,858
Damn it!

516
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:51,535
My parents were artists.

517
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:57,791
They met as freshmen in college
while doing charity.

518
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,502
It was love at first sight,
and they got married.

519
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,379
Neither of them had parents.

520
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:06,425
But as promising artists,
they always prayed

521
00:48:06,508 --> 00:48:09,803
for a typical, happy life
even if they wouldn't have enough money.

522
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:14,182
However, their prayers weren't answered.

523
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,226
And their life wasn't typical.

524
00:48:17,728 --> 00:48:20,314
They had twins, Disaster and me.

525
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:23,400
And that's when misfortune struck.

526
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,363
Being kindhearted,
they quickly came to their senses.

527
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,907
They gave up on art,
which didn't pay well,

528
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:34,328
and sold clothes so they could
take care of my sickly sister.

529
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,790
And they were always sincere
when they said this.

530
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,336
They said the reason why
Yeong-hui came to us

531
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:47,799
was that God approved of us
as a kindhearted family.

532
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,179
They said God only blessed
the kindhearted and generous

533
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,098
who deserved to take care

534
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,185
of a sickly or special child.

535
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,605
They said we were the chosen ones.

536
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,566
That's just ludicrous.

537
00:49:05,817 --> 00:49:07,277
If that's true,

538
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:09,696
then God has made a mistake.

539
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,728
It's true that my parents
were kind and generous.

540
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:44,439
But I am neither kind

541
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:48,235
nor understanding enough
to withstand all of us.

542
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:52,239
This so-called "blessing" from God
was a burden to me.

543
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:02,416
Our parents passed away when we were 12.

544
00:50:03,166 --> 00:50:06,169
Once again, this was
God's mistake and reckless behavior.

545
00:50:06,753 --> 00:50:08,088
Why did you do it?

546
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,923
Why did you do it?

547
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:13,218
Why did you do it?

548
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:18,890
Why did you do it?

549
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:21,852
Why did you do it?

550
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:25,981
-It was you.
-It's so annoying. She must be crazy.

551
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:27,899
If…

552
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:29,776
If you're stupid…

553
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:32,320
As if that wasn't enough,
she's schizophrenic too.

554
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,448
Does she even take her medication?

555
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,534
She does, but the effects
aren't immediate.

556
00:50:38,410 --> 00:50:40,078
It takes some time.

557
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,792
I'm going to work. How frustrating…

558
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,880
How much longer
do I need to put up with this?

559
00:50:52,299 --> 00:50:56,678
For some time, we lived with our aunt
who was as kind as our mom.

560
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:01,683
But that only lasted for a year.

561
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:04,728
Yeong-hui is special.

562
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:07,981
She's especially weird.

563
00:51:08,064 --> 00:51:10,066
She's especially ugly.

564
00:51:10,150 --> 00:51:12,986
And she especially makes
my life miserable.

565
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,573
The door is closing.

566
00:51:31,546 --> 00:51:33,048
Yeong-ok?

567
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:37,219
Should I have left her then?

568
00:51:43,558 --> 00:51:45,852
-When I entered the alley
-When I entered the alley

569
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:47,687
Despite not being kindhearted,

570
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,191
I just couldn't leave her.

571
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:55,779
-The curtains were drawn
-The curtains were drawn

572
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,323
-In front of your window
-In front of your window

573
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:03,662
-I just stared at them in silence
-I just stared at them in silence

574
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:13,672
Let's go.

575
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:19,803
-I pine for you once I walk away
-I pine for you once I walk away

576
00:52:19,886 --> 00:52:22,430
Goodness.

577
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:24,391
Good job.

578
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,483
Why are you guys standing there?

579
00:52:34,526 --> 00:52:36,611
I'm Yeong-hui, the older one.

580
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:40,156
She's Yeong-ok, my younger sister.

581
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:47,581
Yeong-hui, I'll earn some money
and buy you some bread.

582
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,748
And clothes too.

583
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,962
Make a lot of money so I can get surgery

584
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:56,756
and look like you.

585
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,841
Okay.

586
00:52:57,924 --> 00:53:01,052
I'll make loads of money
and turn you into a beauty.

587
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:04,097
I love you.

588
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:08,143
Yeong-ok.

589
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,061
-Be safe.
-I will.

590
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,354
I love you.

591
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,064
I'll come by often.

592
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:16,860
You have to.

593
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:20,614
I was around 22 years old.

594
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,992
I lied and said
I was leaving to make some money.

595
00:53:25,076 --> 00:53:26,953
I just wanted to get away from her.

596
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:31,374
That's why I worked farther away
from Gyeonggi to Chungcheong,

597
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,959
then to Gangneung,

598
00:53:33,043 --> 00:53:35,629
Tongyeong, and finally, Jeju.

599
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:38,089
I didn't keep my promise either.

600
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:41,051
I only wired her money
and didn't visit that often.

601
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,012
At first, I visited once every two months.

602
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,932
Then I made up excuses

603
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:49,893
and visited after six months,
then after a year.

604
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,855
Lately, I've kept in touch with her
but haven't seen her in two years.

605
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:59,903
I thought doing so
would make Yeong-hui forget about me.

606
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:05,116
Or I thought she'd be too tired of waiting
and stop looking for me.

607
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:10,455
But I underestimated her.

608
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,474
Yeong-hui.

609
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,984
Yeong-ok!

610
00:54:57,002 --> 00:55:01,631
You've grown a lot, my dear Yeong-ok.

611
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,345
Why have you gained so much weight?

612
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,559
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

613
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:14,811
Let's go.

614
00:55:18,815 --> 00:55:20,066
It's been a while.

615
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,656
Hey, why did you bring so much luggage?

616
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,534
I brought my drawing and knitting tools.

617
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:31,494
You can't draw.

618
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,830
Yes, I can.

619
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:37,042
Should I carry that bag for you?

620
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:39,461
Don't touch it. I can carry it.

621
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:41,337
Jeez, what a temper.

622
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:45,592
By the way, I'm impressed
that you came here by yourself.

623
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:50,013
I'm pretty impressive.

624
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,057
You're all grown up.

625
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,142
Yes, I am.

626
00:55:54,225 --> 00:55:56,770
I'm an adult. A grown-up.

627
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,939
I'm past

628
00:56:00,774 --> 00:56:02,275
thirty now.

629
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:05,487
You still can't count, can you?

630
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,322
We're 38.

631
00:56:07,405 --> 00:56:10,158
We were 36 when we met 2 years ago.

632
00:56:12,118 --> 00:56:15,497
You've become prettier.

633
00:56:16,247 --> 00:56:17,707
Stop avoiding the topic.

634
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:20,335
Don't try to squirm your way out
and learn how to count.

635
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:22,462
You learned the alphabet after all.

636
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,048
You're still studying numbers, right?

637
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:27,967
You're driving me crazy.

638
00:56:59,624 --> 00:57:01,751
I know you don't like clingy men.

639
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:04,129
I don't want to do this either.

640
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,715
But I just couldn't sit still.

641
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,136
Do you want to say hi
to my sister from Seoul?

642
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:21,187
Seong-jun?

643
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,606
We broke up more than three years ago.

644
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:28,069
Then is he Cheol-ung?

645
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:30,196
It's been more than a decade.

646
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,657
Then who are you?

647
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:37,245
I'm Yeong-hui, her twin sister.

648
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,873
Well…

649
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:41,916
I…

650
00:57:43,668 --> 00:57:44,878
I'm…

651
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:50,008
My name is Park Jeong-jun.

652
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:51,092
You look pretty shocked.

653
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:56,931
She's Yeong-hui, my twin sister.

654
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:58,933
She has Down syndrome.

655
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,857
Grade-two developmental disability.

656
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:14,616
If you're unfamiliar with it,
look it up online.

657
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,075
Bye.

658
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:33,968
Don't date him.

659
00:58:34,052 --> 00:58:37,388
Why not? You like handsome men,
and he's handsome.

660
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,724
He was shocked when he saw me.

661
00:58:39,807 --> 00:58:41,851
He wasn't welcoming.

662
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:44,896
Fine. I won't date him.

663
00:58:44,979 --> 00:58:46,397
DOWN SYNDROME IS A GENETIC DISORDER…

664
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:56,533
Dal-i!

665
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,622
Just say it here.

666
00:59:03,331 --> 00:59:05,291
I don't want to say it
when Byeol-i is here.

667
00:59:06,292 --> 00:59:08,795
That's what I don't understand.

668
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,381
Why can't you talk about it
when she's here?

669
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:14,175
It'll only take 30 minutes.

670
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,427
Can you please just listen to me?

671
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:20,765
I'm going home. You two can hang out.

672
00:59:20,848 --> 00:59:21,933
Hang out with him?

673
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:23,560
Why would I do that?

674
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,605
Byeol-i. Byeol--

675
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:30,358
Why bother calling her when she's deaf?

676
00:59:30,441 --> 00:59:31,651
Don't touch me.

677
00:59:31,734 --> 00:59:33,278
Let's go to a cafe.

678
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:38,533
It better be worth it.
If not, you're dead meat.

679
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:42,579
How dare he upset my sister
and make her leave?

680
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:54,799
Hey.

681
00:59:55,508 --> 00:59:57,176
You're a great judge of character.

682
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,554
Come out. I'll treat you
to some delicious dinner.

683
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:01,681
Hey.

684
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:05,226
-Does this mean you approve?
-Of course.

685
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,021
I bless your love.

686
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:23,745
Hi, guys.

687
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:24,912
Hey.

688
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:30,543
Eun-hui, I'll be using the toilet.

689
01:00:30,627 --> 01:00:31,836
Sure, go ahead.

690
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,194
She's my older twin sister, Yeong-hui.

691
01:00:56,277 --> 01:00:58,237
She suddenly had to go.

692
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:00,907
Let's go.

693
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:07,789
Stop staring.

694
01:01:12,794 --> 01:01:18,049
She definitely said that the girl
was her older twin sister, right?

695
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:20,051
Goodness.

696
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:22,512
I thought her parents were artists.

697
01:01:23,054 --> 01:01:24,764
What's wrong with their daughter?

698
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,559
What does her parents' occupation
have to do with her sister?

699
01:01:29,811 --> 01:01:33,815
Her twin sister seems to be a bit slow.

700
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,943
She's not slow.

701
01:01:37,026 --> 01:01:39,570
She has Down syndrome.

702
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:42,615
What? What is she saying?

703
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:45,118
Didn't you hear her? She has Down…

704
01:01:45,201 --> 01:01:46,035
What was it?

705
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:48,996
Down syndrome! Are you deaf?

706
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:52,500
I mean…

707
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:57,213
I can't understand Byeol-i that well.

708
01:01:57,296 --> 01:01:58,840
You're the one who's slow!

709
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:00,758
You're not deaf, yet you can't understand.

710
01:02:00,842 --> 01:02:04,387
Byeol-i said "Down syndrome,"
loud and clear.

711
01:02:04,470 --> 01:02:05,888
But only you couldn't understand.

712
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,141
Just leave! Don't bother us
when we're working.

713
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:09,976
Fine! I'll leave!

714
01:02:10,685 --> 01:02:12,979
Why are you bullying me?

715
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,775
She's so eager to gossip about others.

716
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:22,697
I was just a bit taken aback.

717
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:27,118
I never knew she had a disabled sister.

718
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:29,370
I wasn't judging by any means.

719
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:34,000
Don't act surprised
next time you see them.

720
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,461
That's common courtesy.

721
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,465
My granddaughter is autistic.

722
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:43,259
I'm telling you since everyone else knows.

723
01:02:48,139 --> 01:02:49,515
Hop in, Yeong-hui.

724
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,360
No. Let's go.

725
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,238
Don't stare at others when they're eating.
We have ice cream at home.

726
01:03:04,322 --> 01:03:05,573
Hello.

727
01:03:06,073 --> 01:03:08,326
I live with Yeong-ok, ma'am.

728
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:10,036
Wait, she's younger than me.

729
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:11,579
We live in the same house.

730
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,545
Get her some ice cream.

731
01:03:20,129 --> 01:03:21,964
No, that's okay.

732
01:03:22,715 --> 01:03:24,550
Just listen to the elderly.

733
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:26,844
Come here and sit down. Here.

734
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,682
Yes. Come here.

735
01:03:37,939 --> 01:03:41,150
How do you do this?

736
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,277
Do you want to help?

737
01:03:50,493 --> 01:03:53,120
Like this.

738
01:03:53,204 --> 01:03:55,122
Like this.

739
01:04:03,464 --> 01:04:04,549
Good.

740
01:04:05,925 --> 01:04:07,969
Hey, you're good.

741
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,775
She's pretty good at this.

742
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,528
-That's it.
-Goodness.

743
01:04:25,611 --> 01:04:26,696
Yeong-ok.

744
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:28,906
We need to talk.

745
01:04:30,491 --> 01:04:33,703
What are you doing?
He wants to speak with you. Go on.

746
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,707
Go. We'll take care of Yeong-hui.

747
01:04:43,254 --> 01:04:44,380
Here.

748
01:04:45,798 --> 01:04:47,466
I'm deaf.

749
01:04:48,593 --> 01:04:51,262
That makes us friends.

750
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,501
My name is Park Jeong-jun.

751
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:26,255
I'm your sister's boyfriend.

752
01:05:26,964 --> 01:05:28,341
I hope we get along.

753
01:05:33,346 --> 01:05:36,974
Gosh. We didn't know you guys were dating.

754
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:40,311
Everyone already knew except for you.

755
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:50,488
Yeong-hui, stay here for a minute.

756
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,782
Don't eat too much of that.

757
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:56,160
You have a weak sphincter,
so you might cause a mess.

758
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,495
That's not true.

759
01:05:59,163 --> 01:06:00,498
I'll be back soon.

760
01:06:01,999 --> 01:06:02,917
Follow me.

761
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,463
Excuse us.

762
01:06:09,090 --> 01:06:10,383
You better hurry back.

763
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,927
I don't like

764
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:15,388
that guy.

765
01:06:16,722 --> 01:06:19,392
-He's a good man.
-No, he's not.

766
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,352
No. He's a good man.

767
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:22,853
No, he's not.

768
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,731
Have you two already become friends?

769
01:06:39,912 --> 01:06:41,330
Stop being stubborn.

770
01:06:43,582 --> 01:06:45,042
Why do we need to break up?

771
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:50,923
I said I wanted to have fun.
I didn't want it to get serious.

772
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,425
So why marriage?

773
01:06:53,342 --> 01:06:55,344
I was being sincere, not serious.

774
01:06:57,263 --> 01:06:59,765
I only went out with you
because I wanted to have fun.

775
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:02,518
But this is no longer fun.

776
01:07:03,394 --> 01:07:05,855
Are you having fun? No, right?

777
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,649
Let's stop this boring act.

778
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:12,111
I hope you've calmed down
about Yeong-hui now.

779
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,489
Don't touch me.

780
01:07:21,746 --> 01:07:23,080
I'm not saying we should get married now.

781
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:25,791
-I'm just saying let's consider--
-It means the same thing.

782
01:07:30,629 --> 01:07:31,630
Fine.

783
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:35,217
Getting a house. Marriage.

784
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:37,803
If it makes you uneasy,
I won't mention them.

785
01:07:39,346 --> 01:07:41,348
Don't meet my parents either.

786
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:44,560
But we're no longer kids.

787
01:07:45,436 --> 01:07:47,313
Why is having fun so important?

788
01:07:48,105 --> 01:07:49,899
At times, life can be boring.

789
01:07:50,608 --> 01:07:52,443
Or it could get serious like today.

790
01:07:53,360 --> 01:07:55,196
So what's the big deal?

791
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,408
No one can always have fun.

792
01:08:00,034 --> 01:08:01,452
This is normal.

793
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:04,914
This is life. There are good and bad days.

794
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:07,750
-Hey, Captain--
-Fine.

795
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,923
I was surprised when I saw her.

796
01:08:15,883 --> 01:08:17,343
But it's understandable.

797
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,720
I had never seen
someone with Down syndrome before.

798
01:08:20,846 --> 01:08:23,516
So it's understandable
that I was taken aback.

799
01:08:25,226 --> 01:08:26,602
If that was wrong of me, I'm sorry.

800
01:08:28,687 --> 01:08:32,024
I was never taught at school
nor at home about how to react

801
01:08:32,108 --> 01:08:34,193
when meeting a disabled person.

802
01:08:35,736 --> 01:08:37,988
I just didn't know how to react.

803
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,115
That's why.

804
01:08:45,371 --> 01:08:47,331
But it won't happen ever again.

805
01:08:49,834 --> 01:08:51,585
So don't say you want to break up.

806
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,880
Why break up when we're in love?

807
01:09:08,894 --> 01:09:10,062
Even after meeting her,

808
01:09:10,938 --> 01:09:12,606
do you still want to date me?

809
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:14,400
I do.

810
01:09:15,359 --> 01:09:16,902
Yes, I was taken aback,

811
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:20,114
but I'll get used to her and befriend her.

812
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:23,242
We're not breaking up because of her.

813
01:09:27,746 --> 01:09:29,999
There's something else
that would make you hesitate.

814
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:32,960
How about this?

815
01:09:35,045 --> 01:09:36,589
Our parents…

816
01:09:37,798 --> 01:09:40,759
passed away when we were 12.

817
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:42,386
In other words,

818
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:46,056
I'll have to take care of her
my entire life.

819
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:52,146
This time, you accepted it well.

820
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:54,273
Good job.

821
01:09:57,401 --> 01:09:59,069
But all the others did the same.

822
01:10:08,287 --> 01:10:10,581
Cheol-ung, Jae-deok, Min-ho, and Seong-jun

823
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:12,708
all said the same thing

824
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,211
before sleeping with me.

825
01:10:15,294 --> 01:10:16,212
No.

826
01:10:16,795 --> 01:10:20,132
One of them stayed around
until he was sick of Yeong-hui and me.

827
01:10:21,926 --> 01:10:24,887
But ultimately, they were all sick of us.

828
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,680
Especially her.

829
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,849
Can you please stop talking about them?

830
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:32,144
I was truly hurt by them every time.

831
01:10:32,770 --> 01:10:37,358
So this time, I never wanted you
to find out about my sister.

832
01:10:38,108 --> 01:10:39,443
But look what happened.

833
01:10:40,986 --> 01:10:44,823
Don't bother trying to look cool.
Just leave while you can.

834
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,326
I said I wasn't leaving.

835
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,872
Why not?

836
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,458
Do you think you're any different?

837
01:10:55,042 --> 01:10:58,128
Do you think you can love me the same
and not care what your family

838
01:10:58,212 --> 01:10:59,630
or the others think?

839
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:04,760
Do you think you can accept
my sister as family and a friend forever?

840
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:07,137
Yes. I'm different from those bastards.

841
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:13,769
You're not.

842
01:11:16,313 --> 01:11:19,900
I will never leave you or let you leave.

843
01:11:20,901 --> 01:11:22,861
You will regret
treating me like this one day.

844
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:27,700
You underestimated me
and thought I was worthless.

845
01:11:31,161 --> 01:11:32,079
Let go.

846
01:11:32,663 --> 01:11:35,708
No. Everyone knows now.
We don't need to hide it.

847
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:37,126
There is no reason to anymore.

848
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:47,678
Fine. Let's see how long you'll last.

849
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:49,763
Find out for yourself

850
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:52,099
how much I love you.

851
01:12:44,818 --> 01:12:47,738
Just take it easy.
You don't have to be too nice to her.

852
01:12:53,744 --> 01:12:55,662
-Are you doing well?
-Of course.

853
01:12:55,746 --> 01:12:57,331
I miss you at times.

854
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:59,708
Only as a friend?

855
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:02,461
Break up with Yeong-ok.

856
01:13:02,544 --> 01:13:05,798
Maybe I should just live here.

857
01:13:05,881 --> 01:13:07,424
Don't be ridiculous!

858
01:13:07,508 --> 01:13:10,469
You brat! You abandoned me, didn't you?

859
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:12,137
She knows everything!

860
01:13:12,930 --> 01:13:14,640
She remembers everything!

861
01:13:17,851 --> 01:13:22,856
