1
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,112
YEONG-OK AND JEONG-JUN

2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,700
A CAPTAIN AND A HAENYEO TRY NOT TO BE
SERIOUS AMIDST LIES AND RUMORS

3
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,982
YEONG-OK, JEONG-JUN, AND YEONG-HUI 2

4
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,458
-Thank you.
-Why haven't you visited in so long?

5
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:32,675
Here.

6
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,677
It's on the house.

7
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:37,222
-You don't need to do that.
-No, just take it.

8
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,474
Just bring me two yellowtails next time.

9
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:41,518
-Just take it.
-Hey, come on.

10
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,729
Goodness, that boy.

11
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,577
Dong-seok, let's eat.

12
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,931
Say, "Hello." Hi.

13
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:24,644
SEON-A

14
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:27,730
She doesn't send me any texts,
but she sends me videos

15
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,191
of her daily life almost every day.

16
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,527
What do you think it means?

17
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:36,030
You know what it means.

18
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,033
How would I know? I'm dumb.

19
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:45,540
She knows you're worried about her,
and she likes you.

20
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:48,835
It's her way of saying,
"I'm doing well. How about you?"

21
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,713
But you didn't send her anything.

22
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,047
I don't send her stuff.

23
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,507
Why not?

24
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,176
Are you playing hard to get?

25
00:02:57,844 --> 00:02:58,678
Cut the crap.

26
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:01,556
I'm off.

27
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,141
Hey, wait.

28
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:04,809
Hey. Help me out if you're free.

29
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,644
No, I need to go.

30
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:08,813
Yeong-ok's sister is here.

31
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,650
She wanted raw fish, so I bought some.
I just dropped by on my way back.

32
00:03:12,734 --> 00:03:15,236
-How's it going with Yeong-ok?
-Good.

33
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,037
Dong-seok.

34
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,541
Yeong-ok's sister is a little unwell.

35
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:32,086
She has Down syndrome.

36
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,671
She's like a baby.

37
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,591
I know Down syndrome.
I've seen it in movies.

38
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:38,968
Their parents have passed.

39
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:43,348
I'm okay with all of that,

40
00:03:44,182 --> 00:03:47,685
but I need advice on how to convince
my parents and Gi-jun.

41
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,481
I'm in no place to give you any advice.

42
00:03:52,857 --> 00:03:53,942
Hey.

43
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:56,152
If your parents and Gi-jun

44
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:58,905
tell you to break up, will you?

45
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,031
No.

46
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:02,367
Then there's your answer.

47
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:05,995
Just do what you want
and be bullheaded about it like me.

48
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,625
I'm in love with a woman
whose father killed himself,

49
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,587
and whose mother got remarried.
She got divorced, and she even has a kid.

50
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,924
Plus, we barely meet each other.
But I still like her.

51
00:04:18,675 --> 00:04:21,302
It's my life.
Who cares what other people think?

52
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,472
You don't even owe your parents anything.

53
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:27,725
You didn't go to college,
which saved them money,

54
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,227
and you bought that boat on your own.

55
00:04:30,144 --> 00:04:31,479
In situations like this,

56
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:34,107
we're better off
since we don't owe our parents anything.

57
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,234
What can they do?

58
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:39,153
All they did for us was give birth,

59
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,572
so they have no say.

60
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,618
But they still brought me into this world.

61
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,955
If not for them,
I wouldn't have met Yeong-ok.

62
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,250
If you say that, what does that make me?

63
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,253
You punk.

64
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:57,922
You said you slept with her.

65
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:00,842
You slept with her. You like her.

66
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:03,970
She trusts you.
You can't walk away from that.

67
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,723
You two already built something together.

68
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:09,183
Tell your parents this.

69
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,602
"Mom, Dad, listen."

70
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,397
"I've made my decision." That's it.

71
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,026
If your dad beats you, then just let him.

72
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,612
As for Gi-jun, you can deal with him.

73
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:28,328
You're right.

74
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:34,250
I guess there's no way
to satisfy everyone.

75
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:38,379
I'll just put up with
whatever my parents have to say.

76
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:40,548
Thanks, Dong-seok.

77
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:43,051
My head's all clear now.

78
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,802
Go on, before the raw fish goes bad.

79
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:46,929
All right, bye.

80
00:06:29,388 --> 00:06:31,557
SEON-A

81
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,438
The house looks great.

82
00:06:38,106 --> 00:06:40,691
I just wanted to show you
how far along I was

83
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,362
and boast that I'm better
than most carpenters.

84
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:47,657
But I'm not pressuring you
to come or anything.

85
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:50,701
Is your kid doing well?

86
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,955
It's nice of you to ask about Yeol.

87
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:55,998
Are you doing well?

88
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:58,543
Of course.

89
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:00,670
I'm doing everything you told me to do.

90
00:07:01,212 --> 00:07:02,839
I work out every day,

91
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,175
and I miss you at times.

92
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:09,345
Only as a friend?

93
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,598
Ms. Min.

94
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:16,561
I'm working right now. I'm at the office.

95
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:19,439
I'll call you later.
My colleague needs me.

96
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:22,108
All right, then. Bye.

97
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:22,418
Here.

98
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,594
BOIL OINTMENT
APPLY 3 TIMES A DAY

99
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,393
Don't hate him so much.

100
00:08:39,936 --> 00:08:43,773
I know the captain seemed startled
when he first saw you,

101
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,274
but he's a decent guy.

102
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,443
Did you sleep with him?

103
00:08:48,486 --> 00:08:49,820
It's rude to ask that.

104
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,115
Did you sleep with him naked?

105
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,452
How do you know that kind of stuff?
Okay, where else?

106
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,168
Are you going to marry him?

107
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:05,795
Are you going to have kids?

108
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:07,630
That's enough.

109
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:11,425
Do you think aging leads
to poor blood circulation?

110
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,136
Why are your boils getting worse?

111
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:19,850
-It's because you ate ice cream.
-No, it's not.

112
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,895
Sure, it is.
That stuff is bad for your digestion.

113
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,107
The ice cream caused you
to have diarrhea yesterday.

114
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,151
You have digestive problems
because of your weak stomach.

115
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,737
I can't believe you pooped your pants.

116
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,364
Hey, stop it.

117
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:36,284
-No, you can't stop me.
-Stop talking about poop.

118
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:37,868
No, I'm going to talk about it.

119
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,538
I'm going to say it. Poop!

120
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,914
You pooped your pants!

121
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,165
Stop it.

122
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,334
You're so strong! Come here!

123
00:09:46,877 --> 00:09:49,589
Yeong-hui, are you
going to eat ice cream again?

124
00:09:58,222 --> 00:09:59,765
What do you want?

125
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,435
Can we talk?

126
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:05,021
Why are you using sign language?

127
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,814
Sign language is for deaf people.

128
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:07,732
What?

129
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,110
Why are you using sign language

130
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,154
when you can't even understand it?

131
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,822
It's for deaf people.

132
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:20,995
Let's go out.

133
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,957
Will you go out with me? I like you.

134
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,919
If you like me,
does that mean I have to like you back?

135
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,756
Why? Because I'm disabled?

136
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:37,136
Let me make myself clear.
I don't like you.

137
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,857
I'll do this one, okay?

138
00:10:51,067 --> 00:10:52,109
I think it'll work.

139
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,903
-Wait.
-Are you sure?

140
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:55,905
-Hey, give me a second.
-Careful.

141
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,574
I did it.

142
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,911
-We're going to win.
-We're going to win.

143
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:05,873
-She's scary.
-So scary.

144
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,708
Seong-jun, go ahead.

145
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:08,876
Captain.

146
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,837
-Seong-jun, it's your turn.
-"Seong-jun"?

147
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,339
Who's Seong-jun?

148
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:16,592
He's my ex-boyfriend.
I dated him the longest until recently.

149
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:19,387
Don't mind her, Jeong-jun.
She's just being mean.

150
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:21,680
She knows how to express herself.

151
00:11:21,764 --> 00:11:25,935
It's okay. She'll end up
liking me a lot more than that punk.

152
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,270
Here I go.

153
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:31,607
No, it won't work.

154
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,945
-Nice!
-Yes!

155
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,322
Don't shout. It might collapse.

156
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,243
-It's my turn.
-Eun-hui.

157
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:43,202
-Careful.
-Okay.

158
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,287
-Let's go.
-I'll go with this one.

159
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,958
Good job, Yeong-hui!

160
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,209
Oh, come on.

161
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,294
-Nice one, Yeong-hui!
-We did it!

162
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,130
Hey, that's cheating.

163
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,715
-Let's play again.
-No way. Yeong-hui won.

164
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,050
Isn't that right?

165
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,636
Now, let's have a beer.

166
00:12:03,305 --> 00:12:04,807
Why do you all look surprised?

167
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,394
She's old enough to drink.
We're all here for her.

168
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:09,979
Let's drink.

169
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:12,606
-She's right.
-Yes.

170
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:13,524
She's allowed.

171
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,443
-Right.
-Yes, she's allowed to drink.

172
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,529
What's your go-to beer?

173
00:12:18,612 --> 00:12:20,906
Go-to beer.

174
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:25,202
Oh, so you like Go-to Beer?

175
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,125
-"Go-to Beer."
-"Go-to Beer."

176
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,257
That constellation over there

177
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,342
is called "The Big Dipper."

178
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,678
The…

179
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,638
The Big Dipper?

180
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:49,018
That constellation over there
is called "Cassiopeia."

181
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:53,522
Maybe that's too hard.

182
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,694
Cassiopeia?

183
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,197
-Good job!
-That was great.

184
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:05,201
Then let's move on to that one.
That one is called "Venus."

185
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:07,828
Venus?

186
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,371
-Great!
-Nice!

187
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:12,625
-Good job!
-You're good at this.

188
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:14,919
-Come inside, guys.
-Let's go.

189
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,881
-It's beer!
-Gosh.

190
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:21,133
Here.

191
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,346
We need to make a toast.

192
00:13:26,722 --> 00:13:28,682
Here. Cheers to Yeong-hui.

193
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,392
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

194
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:36,482
That's nice and cold.

195
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:39,360
Here.

196
00:13:41,362 --> 00:13:43,572
-Is it delicious?
-Yes, it's the best.

197
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:45,074
The best?

198
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,834
Yeong-hui, do a wave.

199
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,503
How do you do it?

200
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:59,588
Gosh, I don't think I can do that!

201
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,217
You're amazing. How did you do it?

202
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,928
Look at her dance.

203
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:08,347
-She's a great dancer!
-Who taught you these moves?

204
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:09,557
-She's good.
-I don't know.

205
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,142
-You don't know? Well, teach me.
-How do you do it?

206
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:16,230
Yeong-ok, come dance with me.

207
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,024
I'd rather just watch.

208
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:23,153
-You're good. How do you do it?
-My back hurts.

209
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,905
-Your back.
-This is too hard.

210
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:27,616
You don't have to be too nice to her.

211
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,620
You remember things
from back when you were seven, right?

212
00:14:32,997 --> 00:14:36,000
Maybe not everything, but I'm sure
you remember all the big events.

213
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:39,795
It's the same with her.

214
00:14:46,468 --> 00:14:49,513
She may have an IQ of a seven-year-old,
and not know how to count.

215
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:52,224
She may not be fully aware of things,

216
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,144
but she knows enough.

217
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:01,650
She knows how it feels
to love someone or be loved.

218
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,403
The feeling of betrayal and hatred.

219
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:06,739
The sorrow of losing our parents,

220
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,033
and how sad it is to be disabled.

221
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,076
She knows all that.

222
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:13,913
Look at her dance.

223
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:16,749
So don't be too nice to her.

224
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,504
Don't look at her
with affection like that either.

225
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:27,843
What if she feels loved and refuses
to leave? What will you do then?

226
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,604
Just take it easy.

227
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,774
That's what I'm doing.

228
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:47,279
I do just enough so that
she'll be able to forget about me

229
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,491
once she returns to the care facility.

230
00:15:53,494 --> 00:15:55,162
So that she won't miss me enough

231
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:58,540
to want to come back here.

232
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,462
So that she'll feel more attached
to Ms. Jang, her caregiver, than to me.

233
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:06,966
That's why I'm taking it easy.

234
00:16:08,634 --> 00:16:11,261
It's not that
I don't want to treat her better.

235
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:16,350
It's so that so she won't get hurt.

236
00:16:18,894 --> 00:16:21,522
Yeong-hui can spend time
with Byeol-i tomorrow.

237
00:16:21,605 --> 00:16:23,023
So just do what you need to do.

238
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:26,819
I already took a week off
from the fixed-net fishing gig.

239
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:33,158
Fine. Do as you wish.

240
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:36,078
Let's see how long it lasts.

241
00:16:39,915 --> 00:16:41,834
Yeong-hui, let's call it a day.

242
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:50,718
You took enough photos.

243
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:52,803
Will you all stay still?

244
00:16:52,886 --> 00:16:55,723
The photos I took are all out of focus.

245
00:16:55,806 --> 00:16:58,892
That's because you're drunk
and can't hold the phone still.

246
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:02,021
I told you to drink one can,
but you drank three,

247
00:17:02,104 --> 00:17:04,565
and now they can't even
go home because of you.

248
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,108
What is this nonsense?

249
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:09,278
-That's enough.
-I need these photos

250
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,613
to draw.

251
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,659
Yeong-ok, we're fine.

252
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,162
Yeong-hui, go ahead and take our photos.

253
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:20,873
Yes, she's going to draw pictures of us,

254
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:22,958
so this is the least we can do.

255
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,793
She's right. Go ahead, Yeong-hui.

256
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,173
-Just stop. I'll take it for you.
-No, I…

257
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,507
I'll do it myself.

258
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,634
You can't draw. Let go.

259
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,845
Let go already. Enough is enough.

260
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:38,932
You brat!

261
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,225
You don't believe me!

262
00:17:40,809 --> 00:17:43,020
You don't believe that
I draw like Mom and Dad!

263
00:17:43,103 --> 00:17:46,607
You don't believe that I'm an artist!

264
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,859
You…

265
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,154
You abandoned me
on the subway, didn't you?

266
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,879
Stop talking nonsense.

267
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:11,507
When did I ever abandon you?

268
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,550
Mom and Dad

269
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:17,888
told you to be nice to me!

270
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,182
So why did you abandon me? Why?

271
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:22,392
Why did you leave me?

272
00:18:22,476 --> 00:18:23,602
Damn it.

273
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,523
You…

274
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:28,690
You brat!

275
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,109
Watch your language.

276
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,236
Or you'll be sorry.

277
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,539
Her cell phone's pretty old.

278
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,582
I should get her a new one.

279
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,462
She keeps lying these days.

280
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:54,675
She can't draw.
Don't expect anything from her.

281
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,181
This is nothing. It can get a lot worse.

282
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:04,518
Just give up already.

283
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,446
-Let's clean up.
-Okay.

284
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,200
But I must say, Yeong-hui is

285
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:24,413
a lot brighter than I thought.
She gets along with people just fine.

286
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:25,747
Yes, she's cute too.

287
00:19:42,639 --> 00:19:45,058
Why are you so angry?

288
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,896
Are you angry because I told you
to stop taking photos?

289
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:50,189
Or…

290
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:56,987
You abandoned me, didn't you?

291
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,909
Stop talking nonsense.

292
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:05,162
We lived together until we were 22.

293
00:20:05,245 --> 00:20:09,333
We lived with Ms. Jang
and all the other friends.

294
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,169
First, at an orphanage,
then we went to a group home.

295
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:18,258
Stop being a baby
and just show me your drawings.

296
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:21,803
I want to see
if you actually know how to draw.

297
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,181
Is it in there?

298
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,631
Hey, you're curvy.

299
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,633
I'm sleepy.

300
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:11,270
Do you really know how to draw?

301
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,189
I'm good.

302
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,860
Did Ms. Jang tell you you're good?

303
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:22,823
No, not her. It's what I think.

304
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,661
Ms. Jang never saw any of my stuff.

305
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,832
You never saw Mom and Dad draw.

306
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,626
You only heard that they were artists.

307
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:38,088
Did you ever learn how to draw?
I bet you didn't.

308
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,173
So how do you know how to draw?

309
00:21:42,009 --> 00:21:43,635
When we were babies,

310
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,639
Mom and Dad

311
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,934
taught me how.

312
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,276
What are you? A genius?

313
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,363
So you just remembered
what they taught you when you were a baby?

314
00:22:12,122 --> 00:22:13,206
Do you even

315
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:16,001
remember Mom and Dad?

316
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:29,264
How dare you try to bite your sister!

317
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:32,184
If you do that again, I'll bite you.

318
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,103
Oh, how frightening.

319
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,117
Good night, Yeong-hui.

320
00:22:51,078 --> 00:22:52,204
And…

321
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:58,752
I'm…

322
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,755
sorry about…

323
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:03,965
the subway incident.

324
00:24:25,463 --> 00:24:26,715
Yeong-ok.

325
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,426
Go make a lot of money

326
00:24:29,509 --> 00:24:33,054
so I can get surgery.

327
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:34,931
All right.

328
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,309
So I can be pretty

329
00:24:37,392 --> 00:24:39,060
like Byeol-i, Dal-i,

330
00:24:39,144 --> 00:24:40,812
and you.

331
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:43,148
You got it!

332
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,566
Goodness.

333
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,820
I guess she wants to be pretty.

334
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:51,865
You'll have to make a ton of money
to make her look like you.

335
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:55,118
I know. I work hard to make money,
but I still have a long way to go.

336
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,705
She looks just fine.
She doesn't need surgery.

337
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,666
She's fine just as she is.
Don't exhaust yourself.

338
00:25:01,750 --> 00:25:04,711
That's Yeong-ok's business, not yours.

339
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:08,048
She wants surgery
because people look at her strangely.

340
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:10,383
If people complimented her looks

341
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,719
and told her she was pretty all the time,

342
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:14,721
she wouldn't want surgery.

343
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,015
I'm sure she knows
it hurts to get surgery.

344
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,559
-Exactly.
-Hye-ja's right.

345
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,938
-Here.
-Would I look pretty if I get surgery too?

346
00:25:24,314 --> 00:25:26,399
It'll cost a lot of money.

347
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:29,444
-Goodness.
-You have strong teeth.

348
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,614
It's nice to be young.

349
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:35,992
It really is nice to be young.

350
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:39,621
Goodness, look at them.

351
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,250
You almost had me.

352
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,585
-It's too much for us.
-I like candy too.

353
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,170
-Give us some too.
-Come on.

354
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:50,382
-Don't be so stingy.
-Exactly.

355
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:52,175
-Hand them out.
-Here.

356
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,848
What are you staring at?

357
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:00,850
Break up with Yeong-ok.

358
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:05,021
Watch it.

359
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,736
The girl I like is deaf,

360
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,990
and the girl you like
has a disabled sister.

361
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,367
How would our parents react to that?

362
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,337
It's not Dal-i.

363
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,049
I like Byeol-i.

364
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,844
I've liked her for a while.

365
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,054
I won't give up on her.

366
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:49,524
It's all Mom and Dad's fault

367
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:53,069
for giving birth to two handsome,
decent sons.

368
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,281
You drive the boat this afternoon.

369
00:26:56,364 --> 00:26:57,907
I'm spending time with Yeong-hui.

370
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,411
Gosh.

371
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:03,955
Hurry up!

372
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:05,957
Why are they so late?

373
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:09,419
This tastes much better than the last one.

374
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,547
-Hi, ladies.
-Yeong-ok has gotten better at harvesting.

375
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,226
Yeong-hui, how's this?

376
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:11,606
Do you like it?

377
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,861
You buy it.

378
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:21,366
I have money too.

379
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,784
I work

380
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,495
at the care facility cafe.

381
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:30,500
I sell mocha lattes and ice coffees

382
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,085
and make money.

383
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:38,675
But I need to get surgery
so I can become pretty.

384
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:41,344
So you buy this.

385
00:28:43,263 --> 00:28:45,181
You work at a cafe?

386
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,850
That's amazing.

387
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,727
Okay, I'll buy this for you.

388
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,603
Sir.

389
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,105
-Yes?
-We'll buy this one.

390
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,984
And about this…

391
00:28:57,110 --> 00:28:58,778
-The photos?
-Yes.

392
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,990
Can you move the photos in here
to the new phone?

393
00:29:02,073 --> 00:29:03,575
Yes, it's possible.

394
00:29:03,658 --> 00:29:04,617
Thank you.

395
00:29:05,827 --> 00:29:07,078
Yeong-hui, drink slowly.

396
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,913
And not as much as yesterday.

397
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:14,961
Tell me.

398
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:18,798
You like Yeong-ok
because she's pretty, don't you?

399
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,968
No, that's not why.

400
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,304
How should I put it?

401
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:27,432
Yeong-ok is nice.

402
00:29:27,515 --> 00:29:29,434
Stop being funny.

403
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:31,352
Yeong-ok…

404
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,565
is sexy and pretty.

405
00:29:36,441 --> 00:29:37,650
That's why you like her.

406
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:40,945
Guys who like girls based on their looks

407
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,739
and outer appearance

408
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:45,617
are all jerks.

409
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:49,078
Yeong-hui, I'm not that kind of guy.

410
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,372
I care more about what's inside.

411
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,125
Yeong-ok has a beautiful heart.

412
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:57,045
Then do you also…

413
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,381
like me?

414
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,718
Of course, I like you. You're adorable.

415
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:06,054
Then that means

416
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:09,182
I also have a beautiful heart.

417
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,520
But why don't I have a boyfriend?

418
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:18,900
I'm sure you'll meet a great guy like me.

419
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:21,027
I…

420
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:24,322
I won't be able to meet anyone.

421
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,782
Because…

422
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,117
Because…

423
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:33,456
guys only like girls who are pretty.

424
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,588
Do you want a boyfriend?

425
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,298
Of course.

426
00:30:43,508 --> 00:30:45,635
Of course, I want a boyfriend.

427
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:49,180
I want to wear makeup,

428
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:53,184
and I want to look attractive.

429
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:59,607
I also want to know
what it's like to kiss someone.

430
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,526
But…

431
00:31:02,318 --> 00:31:04,070
I don't have a boyfriend.

432
00:31:06,030 --> 00:31:09,284
Guys are fools not to notice
how pretty you are.

433
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,494
You too.

434
00:31:13,204 --> 00:31:14,330
You're right.

435
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:17,542
I fell for Yeong-ok because of her looks.
Gosh, I'm a jerk.

436
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,795
I need more alcohol.
I'm going to drink yours.

437
00:31:21,337 --> 00:31:24,132
Yeong-ok is pretty.

438
00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:28,511
I'm proud of her.

439
00:31:29,095 --> 00:31:31,931
She's not like me.

440
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,183
She's attractive.

441
00:31:34,267 --> 00:31:36,728
She's sexy.

442
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:39,689
I'm scared of the sea,

443
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,650
but she swims in it easily.

444
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,236
Yeong-ok is perfect.

445
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,946
She's pretty.

446
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:52,827
High-five.

447
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,373
You…

448
00:31:57,457 --> 00:32:00,793
You're a really nice guy

449
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,921
for spending time with me.

450
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:07,884
Can I have that once you're done?

451
00:32:07,967 --> 00:32:09,344
No.

452
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:12,013
I'm making it for Yeong-ok.

453
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:47,465
Hey, can you take this to that table?

454
00:32:47,548 --> 00:32:49,050
Enjoy.

455
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,636
Excuse me.

456
00:32:52,470 --> 00:32:54,681
-Can I have a cup of coffee?
-Oh, sure.

457
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,890
Just a second.

458
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,359
Turn off the stove.
Don't eat what's burnt.

459
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,666
Is everything okay?

460
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,502
I'm not spying on you.

461
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,255
Let me know if you need anything.

462
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,940
-Sir.
-Yes?

463
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,150
Can I ask you something?

464
00:33:47,734 --> 00:33:50,820
What's the most popular brand?

465
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:53,614
The ones in that white box
are the most popular.

466
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:57,160
Then what's the most expensive one?

467
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,120
The ones in the red box.

468
00:33:59,203 --> 00:34:00,204
-This one?
-Yes.

469
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,212
Try this. It's delicious.

470
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,550
Stop it.

471
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:17,221
Everyone in Seogwipo
knows that we're going out.

472
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,516
Just take it easy.

473
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:23,811
If we break up,
you'll be the one getting badmouthed.

474
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,733
People won't care how hard it was for you
to bear with everything.

475
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,402
They'll just condemn you

476
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,821
for breaking up with a girl
with a disabled sister.

477
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,409
People don't like you when you're
a woman with a disabled sister.

478
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:41,204
But people also hate guys
who break up with women like that.

479
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,629
That's cold.

480
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,589
Hey.

481
00:34:52,298 --> 00:34:54,050
That's for talking nonsense.

482
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,803
Just make sure you don't dump me.

483
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,429
Wipe your face.

484
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,813
What was that for?

485
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:09,732
Come here.

486
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:13,152
Wipe your face.

487
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:16,155
-Right here.
-I can get you from here.

488
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:17,615
Hey, that's cold!

489
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:15,131
-That was nice.
-Nice pose.

490
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:17,466
-Great.
-Go on.

491
00:36:22,138 --> 00:36:23,514
I'm smiling.

492
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:28,144
-Goodness.
-I hope I look nice.

493
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,646
Smile.

494
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,232
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three, go.

495
00:36:35,902 --> 00:36:36,944
Pose.

496
00:36:41,115 --> 00:36:42,283
Get ready.

497
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,243
Give me a nice pose.

498
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:51,500
Here we go.

499
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,045
One, two, three.

500
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:02,053
Ms. Hyeon.

501
00:37:02,803 --> 00:37:04,388
Yeong-hui can't draw.

502
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,767
She's just lying.

503
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,312
She only says that
because she likes getting attention.

504
00:37:15,107 --> 00:37:16,234
Dong-i and Dong-seok.

505
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:19,946
It doesn't matter if she isn't that good.

506
00:37:20,029 --> 00:37:21,822
Just let her give it a try.

507
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,827
Let her give it a try.

508
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,008
I sent the photos to Yeong-hui,
but don't get your hopes up.

509
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,761
Just don't get disappointed

510
00:37:44,387 --> 00:37:47,932
even if she ends up giving you
a ridiculous drawing.

511
00:37:50,935 --> 00:37:52,561
Yeong-hui, let's go.

512
00:38:01,153 --> 00:38:03,781
Why would we get our hopes up?

513
00:38:04,657 --> 00:38:06,951
When did we ever expect anything in life?

514
00:38:07,451 --> 00:38:09,328
We always just go with the flow.

515
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,553
Yeong-ok, smile a little.

516
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:26,971
Did you guys fight?

517
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,099
Come on. Smile.

518
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:32,852
Stop it.

519
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,563
Can we stop now?

520
00:38:36,689 --> 00:38:38,232
Kiss!

521
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,443
Kiss!

522
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:42,361
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

523
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,322
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

524
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,531
Unbelievable.

525
00:38:47,241 --> 00:38:48,576
My gosh.

526
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,123
Nice.

527
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,459
One, two, three.

528
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,767
-Yeong-hui.
-Yes?

529
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,810
The wind is blowing in your face.

530
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:16,937
There you go.

531
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,148
Stand right here.

532
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,900
-Here?
-Look here.

533
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:23,069
Try standing right here.

534
00:39:38,918 --> 00:39:40,419
I don't like you.

535
00:39:42,171 --> 00:39:43,672
I'm Park Gi-jun.

536
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:47,301
I've liked you since elementary school.

537
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,601
Why do you like me?

538
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,896
I can't even talk properly.

539
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:04,276
In order to talk to you,
I need to look at your eyes,

540
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,487
and they're beautiful.

541
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:10,574
I also like how you stare at me
when you talk to me.

542
00:40:13,536 --> 00:40:14,870
See you tomorrow.

543
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,624
I…

544
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,628
I don't like guys who work at the sea.

545
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,594
If you don't like it,
I'll quit right away.

546
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:34,473
Just go out with me.

547
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,464
Why aren't you having fun?

548
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:10,134
I like being alone.

549
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,845
Do you enjoy solitude?

550
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,641
Who taught you the word "solitude"?

551
00:41:18,225 --> 00:41:19,810
I…

552
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,146
I don't enjoy it.

553
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:26,192
I like being with you.

554
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:33,574
Do you like being in the sea?

555
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:36,410
Yes.

556
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:38,496
When I'm out in the sea,

557
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,165
there's no one else but me.

558
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:47,254
Do you like it there
because I'm not around?

559
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,350
Stop being ridiculous.

560
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:01,268
Let's go eat steak, your favorite.

561
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,146
Captain, let's go.

562
00:42:44,979 --> 00:42:46,105
Here's what you ordered.

563
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:52,194
-Keep it down.
-Enjoy.

564
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,362
Thank you.

565
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:57,491
Eat up.

566
00:42:58,534 --> 00:42:59,952
Yeong-hui, have this.

567
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:20,639
Stop…

568
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:21,599
Stop looking at me.

569
00:43:24,643 --> 00:43:26,020
"Stop…"

570
00:43:26,103 --> 00:43:27,521
"Stop looking at me."

571
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,564
Stupid.

572
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,402
Stop it.

573
00:43:34,361 --> 00:43:35,237
Stop it.

574
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,574
Do you want to switch seats?

575
00:43:41,076 --> 00:43:42,745
Stop…

576
00:43:42,828 --> 00:43:44,455
Stop it.

577
00:43:48,542 --> 00:43:50,502
Just eat your food.

578
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:54,840
I said, stop.

579
00:43:56,258 --> 00:43:58,594
Your kid is making fun of my sister.

580
00:43:58,677 --> 00:44:00,304
Please tell him to stop.

581
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,390
Tell him he shouldn't
stare at disabled people

582
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,392
or make fun of them.

583
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:12,441
Please.

584
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:28,290
Make sure you chew.

585
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,795
Stop! Why are you
making fun of a disabled person?

586
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,340
I hate you, Mom. I'm not going to eat.

587
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,300
That little…

588
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:44,515
Gosh.

589
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:48,060
This is so annoying.
I was looking forward to today.

590
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:51,939
The bathroom.

591
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:55,526
It's over there. Should I go with you?

592
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,042
Let's just go.

593
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,795
I lost my appetite.

594
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:18,465
What are you looking at?

595
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,009
We're going to leave
because we lost our appetite.

596
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:26,640
Your kid made fun of a disabled person,

597
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,436
so I asked you to make him stop.
Was that so appalling for you?

598
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:34,606
I already scolded my kid for doing that.

599
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:37,109
I told him not to mock a disabled person.

600
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,070
Do you have no manners?

601
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,573
Do you have to keep calling her disabled?

602
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:44,658
-What's the matter with you?
-What?

603
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:50,664
That's enough.

604
00:45:51,707 --> 00:45:52,875
It's enough.

605
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:56,128
Sir, please stop.

606
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:00,591
You too, sir.

607
00:46:09,016 --> 00:46:11,143
I'm sorry.

608
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:55,062
Do you like it

609
00:46:56,939 --> 00:46:59,566
if I stare at you like this?

610
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,576
Give me your hand.

611
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:27,636
It's rude to make fun of adults.

612
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,180
It's rude to make fun of disabled people.

613
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:32,516
It's rude to stare too.

614
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,434
Do you like it when I stare?

615
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,437
You'll get punished for that, you know.

616
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,541
It's a red light.

617
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,586
You need to cross
when the light turns green.

618
00:48:34,911 --> 00:48:37,080
Instead of leaving tomorrow,

619
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:40,417
maybe I should just live here, Captain.

620
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,337
Don't be ridiculous!

621
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,339
You're getting on a plane

622
00:48:45,422 --> 00:48:48,091
and going back to the facility tomorrow,
like we promised.

623
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:17,537
Yeong-hui.

624
00:49:21,333 --> 00:49:23,710
You can draw in my house. It's cold.

625
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,464
Come inside if it gets cold.

626
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:28,423
Okay.

627
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:39,518
Why don't you let Yeong-hui stay
for a couple more days?

628
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:44,564
The three of us can go on a trip.

629
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:50,404
Why?

630
00:49:50,487 --> 00:49:52,447
Now that you've spent
about a week with her,

631
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:55,200
do you think
you can take care of her forever?

632
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:57,411
Don't kid yourself.

633
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,996
This is why I told you
not to be nice to her.

634
00:50:01,998 --> 00:50:05,502
Why do you think I tried to break up
with a great guy like you?

635
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:07,879
Today's incident was nothing.

636
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:12,134
What you saw today was very minor.

637
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:19,099
I've experienced a lot worse.

638
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,561
I got into physical fights outside
and in restaurants

639
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,479
and got kicked out for making a scene.

640
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:26,565
I get it.

641
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:29,359
They're not familiar
with people like Yeong-hui.

642
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,610
They think she's weird.

643
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,863
So they just can't help but stare at her.

644
00:50:35,574 --> 00:50:36,783
Do you know why

645
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:40,328
people aren't familiar
with disabled people like Yeong-hui?

646
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:44,416
Because most families send disabled people

647
00:50:44,499 --> 00:50:46,960
to care facilities just like me.

648
00:50:48,962 --> 00:50:50,964
I once thought of living with her.

649
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,759
But it was impossible
to find a place to live together,

650
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:55,135
and I couldn't even work.

651
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,262
If Yeong-hui

652
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:00,974
had gone to a normal school,

653
00:51:01,057 --> 00:51:02,893
her condition could've gotten better.

654
00:51:03,393 --> 00:51:07,230
But they refused to take her in,
and the special school was too far

655
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,274
because people didn't
want them in the city.

656
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:14,654
If I send her to a facility,
people call me cold and heartless.

657
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:17,324
If I don't, today's incident
becomes a daily routine.

658
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,075
So what am I supposed to do?

659
00:51:21,453 --> 00:51:23,079
She knows everything!

660
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:25,665
Even dogs and cats have emotions.

661
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,376
Yeong-hui knows that
people think she's weird.

662
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,880
She knows that

663
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,549
I even tried

664
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,886
to abandon her on the subway
more than 20 years ago.

665
00:51:37,969 --> 00:51:39,304
She remembers everything!

666
00:51:39,805 --> 00:51:42,808
She knows how I feel right now.

667
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,394
She knows how much
I don't want to be with her.

668
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,189
That's why she's outside despite the cold.

669
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,234
She thinks disappearing from my sight
will help me cool my anger.

670
00:51:53,068 --> 00:51:55,570
Even now, she's listening
to everything I'm saying.

671
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,450
But I'm going to act
like I don't know that.

672
00:52:01,243 --> 00:52:04,830
I'm going to think that Yeong-hui doesn't
understand a word I'm saying

673
00:52:04,913 --> 00:52:07,290
because she's too dumb
to think or feel anything.

674
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:10,627
I'm going to believe that
she's just dumb enough

675
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,087
to do what she's told.

676
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,341
That way, I won't have to feel so bad
about sending her back to the facility.

677
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:19,010
Because I live in a world
where I can't live with her.

678
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,972
Do you know what I think
when I meet those kinds of people?

679
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,183
"I hope they end up
with a kid like Yeong-hui."

680
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,061
"If not, then I hope
they get struck by lightning

681
00:52:28,144 --> 00:52:30,605
or get into an accident
and become disabled."

682
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:51,001
Don't say that with your beautiful mouth.

683
00:52:55,005 --> 00:52:56,339
Don't.

684
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,396
It's so unfair.

685
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:15,942
Why did I have to end up
with a sister like her?

686
00:53:17,444 --> 00:53:19,905
Why did my parents leave me
to take care of her

687
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:21,865
when I'm not even a kind person?

688
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:23,992
It's so unfair.

689
00:53:34,461 --> 00:53:36,922
You can't get any kinder than this.

690
00:53:39,299 --> 00:53:41,426
I like you because you're kind.

691
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:46,473
I like the fact that
you couldn't abandon Yeong-hui.

692
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,737
But you see,

693
00:54:02,989 --> 00:54:05,075
if I feel this way,

694
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:09,746
imagine how bad it must be for her.

695
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:33,144
No more than a can of beer each.

696
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:35,939
-Don't drink more than that.
-We'll just drink a can each.

697
00:54:36,022 --> 00:54:37,524
No more.

698
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,485
Yeong-hui.

699
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,320
Your flight is tomorrow morning.

700
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:43,488
I'm not going.

701
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:51,204
Of course, you're going.

702
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,345
The sea looks scary.

703
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:09,180
Does it?

704
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,562
Then I'll just draw the curtains.

705
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:20,859
You're kind.

706
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,569
Of course, Yeong-hui.

707
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,116
Here.

708
00:55:36,332 --> 00:55:38,043
When did you learn to drink?

709
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:41,921
After Yeong-ok became an adult

710
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:45,717
and broke up with Cheol-ung,

711
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:49,471
we went for drinks,
and that's when she taught me.

712
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:52,682
It was nice and refreshing.

713
00:56:04,569 --> 00:56:05,862
What's this?

714
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:14,662
Take a look. They're my drawings.

715
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:27,842
Do you think Yeong-ok will like them?

716
00:56:49,197 --> 00:56:51,074
Do you like them?

717
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,425
They're incredible.

718
00:57:11,886 --> 00:57:14,222
When did you draw all these drawings?

719
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,643
I drew them whenever I got lonely.

720
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:22,021
Whenever I missed…

721
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:24,566
Whenever I missed Yeong-ok.

722
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:50,592
Everyone, I mean…

723
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,928
The ladies will love this.

724
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,640
I bet no one's ever seen
anything like this before.

725
00:57:57,724 --> 00:58:01,853
I hope my adorable sister likes them.

726
00:58:07,233 --> 00:58:09,444
You like her
even though she got angry at you?

727
00:58:10,111 --> 00:58:11,196
That's just

728
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:13,656
how she's like.

729
00:58:14,699 --> 00:58:17,785
But she's a nice girl.

730
00:58:18,828 --> 00:58:20,330
She tried…

731
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:23,041
to abandon me,

732
00:58:23,124 --> 00:58:24,584
but she didn't.

733
00:58:25,376 --> 00:58:29,088
She even let me come to Jeju Island.

734
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:38,473
Yeong-ok will definitely love
these drawings.

735
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:39,974
She'll love them a lot.

736
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:47,565
But they're missing titles.

737
00:58:47,649 --> 00:58:49,692
MS. HYEON

738
00:58:49,776 --> 00:58:50,818
"Ms. Hyeon."

739
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,071
Nice handwriting.

740
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:56,157
Hang on.

741
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:09,003
Every artist should have their own seal.

742
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:15,969
MS. HYEON BY YEONG-HUI

743
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:17,095
It's a chick.

744
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:19,639
It's a bird.

745
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:23,893
A bird that's about to spread its wings
and fly into the sky.

746
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:27,230
-Do you like it?
-Yes.

747
00:59:29,148 --> 00:59:31,317
All right. Let's see.

748
00:59:32,193 --> 00:59:34,279
Let's continue writing the titles.

749
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:36,864
Here. This one is "Dal-i."

750
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:39,617
"Dal…"

751
00:59:48,626 --> 00:59:51,045
Yeong-hui, are you done packing?

752
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:54,257
It's almost time for your flight.
Hurry up and get ready.

753
00:59:54,841 --> 00:59:56,509
You know how to pack your own stuff.

754
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:16,195
Yeong-hui.

755
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,663
Yeong-hui.

756
01:00:36,049 --> 01:00:37,467
What took you so long?

757
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,344
We need to get going.

758
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,304
It's 10 a.m.

759
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,015
I'll miss my flight.

760
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:49,103
Ms. Jang is waiting for me

761
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:52,732
at the care facility.

762
01:00:53,316 --> 01:00:54,817
Go get your jacket.

763
01:00:58,112 --> 01:00:59,530
I'll be back in a minute.

764
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,130
Yeong-hui.

765
01:01:18,508 --> 01:01:20,218
Hey, Yeong-hui. It's me.

766
01:01:24,847 --> 01:01:26,057
What are you doing?

767
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,768
You set it as your wallpaper.

768
01:01:29,352 --> 01:01:30,645
-We look nice.
-Yes.

769
01:01:57,255 --> 01:01:58,673
Please take good care of her.

770
01:02:07,765 --> 01:02:10,476
Don't call me too often.
I'll be busy working.

771
01:02:11,102 --> 01:02:14,272
Eat well and poop well.

772
01:02:15,022 --> 01:02:17,108
Go to the hospital if you ever get sick.

773
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,860
Don't be scared of shots.

774
01:02:24,115 --> 01:02:25,616
I'll see you in winter.

775
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,799
Make a lot of money

776
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,343
so I can get surgery.

777
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:48,139
Go on.

778
01:02:49,098 --> 01:02:50,183
Bye.

779
01:02:52,226 --> 01:02:55,730
Bye, Yeong-hui. I'll see you again.

780
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,911
Bye,

781
01:03:11,287 --> 01:03:13,289
Captain and Yeong-ok.

782
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,047
You should go inside first.
I'll go get some coffee.

783
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,257
Okay.

784
01:05:28,424 --> 01:05:32,511

809
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:28,437
YEONG-HUI AND YEONG-OK LOVE EACH OTHER

810
01:08:41,826 --> 01:08:46,413
YEONG-OK AND JEONG-JUN IN LOVE

811
01:09:21,782 --> 01:09:23,993
Later on, I asked Yeong-hui this.

812
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:28,164
"How did you learn to draw so well?"

813
01:09:29,748 --> 01:09:31,083
Yeong-hui told me

814
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:35,421
that she drew me
whenever she missed me or got lonely,

815
01:09:36,046 --> 01:09:40,050
which is how she became so good at it.

816
01:09:46,724 --> 01:09:49,643
I didn't know what to say to that.

817
01:09:50,728 --> 01:09:53,022
I couldn't imagine
how lonely she must've been

818
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,691
and how much she must've missed me

819
01:09:56,358 --> 01:10:00,738
for a person like her
to become this great of an artist.

820
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,698
YEONG-OK ENJOYING SOLITUDE
WITHOUT YEONG-HUI

821
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:03,866
I was…

822
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:06,285
too scared to find out.

823
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:19,548
YEONG-HUI LOVES HER SISTER, YEONG-OK

824
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:00,005
PUREUNG

825
01:11:16,105 --> 01:11:20,025
YEONG-HUI LOVES HER SISTER, YEONG-OK

826
01:11:21,318 --> 01:11:23,904
I'll come back in two weeks
to pick her up, Mother.

827
01:11:23,988 --> 01:11:25,990
Mom…

828
01:11:26,532 --> 01:11:28,951
Did you buy this for me?

829
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:31,996
I caught the chicken
out in that field over there.

830
01:11:33,539 --> 01:11:36,417
You didn't even let me
ride on your shoulders.

831
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,502
She abandoned her kid
at her mother-in-law's.

832
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:41,338
-Watch what you say in front of the kid!
-Don't fight.

833
01:11:43,924 --> 01:11:46,093
-Carry her on your shoulders.
-Me?

834
01:11:46,677 --> 01:11:49,430
I'm starting to get suspicious
as time goes by.

835
01:11:49,513 --> 01:11:53,392
Did your mom abandon you here?

836
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,103
Where has she gone
after abandoning her own child?

837
01:11:58,731 --> 01:12:03,736
