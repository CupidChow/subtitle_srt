1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,112
MI-RAN AND EUN-HUI

2
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,363
LOYALTY, THREE GOODBYES,
AURORAS IN ICELAND, YOU KNOW, EUN-HUI

3
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,912
Hello?

4
00:01:21,873 --> 00:01:23,124
Oh, well…

5
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,128
Yeong-ok isn't here right now.

6
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,799
May I ask who's calling?

7
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:39,349
Hello?

8
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,727
Hello?

9
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,774
Hello?

10
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,158
Why have you called at this hour?

11
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:10,630
Why can't you sleep if you're tired?

12
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,640
You're lying again.

13
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,310
You don't paint enough
to tire yourself out.

14
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:34,028
How am I to believe that you're painting?

15
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:39,492
Fine. You're an artist.

16
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,246
What?

17
00:02:45,623 --> 00:02:47,667
Fine. Be a writer then.

18
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,921
Yes. A writer.

19
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,135
My boyfriend.

20
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,641
Cheol-ung and I already broke up.

21
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:07,103
I've told you this numerous times.

22
00:03:11,149 --> 00:03:13,693
Hey, you're yawning. Go to bed.

23
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:23,494
Okay. I'll visit you next month.

24
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,459
Yes, I'll visit. I promise.

25
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,881
Yes, I promise.

26
00:03:38,718 --> 00:03:40,678
Okay. Good night.

27
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,022
Who was that?

28
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:58,821
I'm aware of all the rumors about me

29
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,951
and that people are curious
about who's calling me.

30
00:04:04,535 --> 00:04:06,162
I'm aware of them all.

31
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:09,624
They think it's a man

32
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,294
or a child that I left on the mainland.

33
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,388
But neither of them is true.

34
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,233
Then that'll do.

35
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:38,820
Now, I'm willing to accept anything.

36
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:43,825
Obnoxious parents, siblings, or relatives.

37
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:49,080
Clingy ex-boyfriends,
stalkers, or creditors.

38
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:51,457
Bring it on. I'll take care of them.

39
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:54,127
Because you're mine.

40
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,511
How are you so cute?

41
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:20,611
Oh, no.

42
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,740
I've sobered up.

43
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,288
Well…

44
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,915
I've sobered up too.

45
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,127
So I'm going to make the bed.

46
00:05:40,048 --> 00:05:42,091
You know there's only one bedroom, right?

47
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,845
-Yes.
-Okay.

48
00:06:19,378 --> 00:06:21,756
Why are you driving so recklessly?

49
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,843
Why are you so cheerful?

50
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:27,053
I'm not.

51
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,642
You slept together, didn't you?

52
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,064
So you did!

53
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:40,858
You did sleep with her.

54
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,528
Gi-jun.

55
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,114
I'm going to buy one of those houses.

56
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:47,907
A house?

57
00:06:48,783 --> 00:06:52,286
I should get married too.
I'm going to take out a loan.

58
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:54,205
I want one too.

59
00:06:55,414 --> 00:06:57,625
Maybe for your wedding gift
if you're good to me.

60
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,044
-Really?
-I said maybe.

61
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,006
No way. My brother is buying me a house!

62
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,843
-You're the best.
-Don't be disgusting.

63
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:08,469
I should be good to you then.

64
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,015
When will you confess
your feelings to Dal-i?

65
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,336
How do they exhale like that?

66
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:46,257
I bet I could dive for longer periods
if I could do that too.

67
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,577
Help!

68
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,788
Yeong-ok's leg is caught in a net!

69
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,708
Help her!

70
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:49,130
Captain Bae! Please help us!

71
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:50,965
There's a haenyeo underwater!

72
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,495
You can take all of mine!

73
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,416
Here's mine.

74
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,960
And Chun-hui's.

75
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,629
You can take them all.

76
00:11:11,712 --> 00:11:13,714
Are you happy now?

77
00:11:13,798 --> 00:11:15,341
Are you?

78
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,051
What is the matter with you?

79
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:20,429
Why have you come
all the way to this island to bother us?

80
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,347
Tell me!

81
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:23,933
We were supposed to dive for four hours

82
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,768
but only did one because of you!

83
00:11:25,851 --> 00:11:27,311
What have you done?

84
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,355
Hey.

85
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,274
-Take mine.
-Take mine too.

86
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,734
Gosh, don't even bother.

87
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,489
-Ignore her.
-Both Chun-hui and I almost died!

88
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:42,868
Chun-hui may look strong,
but she's in her seventies.

89
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,871
She had to hold her breath for so long
just to save you.

90
00:11:45,955 --> 00:11:49,417
You could've gotten her killed.
What would you have done then?

91
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,211
-Would you have taken responsibility?
-Goodness.

92
00:11:52,294 --> 00:11:54,922
Yeong-ok, Chun-hui wants to see you.

93
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,007
You too, Hye-ja.

94
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:01,679
Let's go.

95
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,057
-Come on.
-That little brat…

96
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:07,226
You'll be the death of us!

97
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,854
-Let's go inside. Gosh.
-Jeez!

98
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:17,236
I'm not going to come anymore
if she remains here.

99
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:20,322
She hasn't apologized
for putting us in grave danger

100
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,783
or thanked us for saving her.

101
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:24,702
What kind of person are you?

102
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:28,080
-I'm sorry.
-Forget it!

103
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:29,874
You should've never done that!

104
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,169
-I'm sorry.
-Don't come back here tomorrow!

105
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:37,256
I refuse to work too if she'll be around.

106
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:41,051
Why should we refuse to work
just because of her?

107
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,678
Let's just kick her out.

108
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,972
I'm going to keep working.
Just kick her out.

109
00:12:45,473 --> 00:12:47,641
Goodness. You're impossible.

110
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:50,144
I'm going to listen to you, Chun-hui.

111
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:53,564
You had saved my life once
when I was young.

112
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,524
I'll do as you say.

113
00:12:56,942 --> 00:12:59,820
Why are you kneeling
when you've done nothing wrong?

114
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,616
-See you tomorrow.
-Bye.

115
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:09,497
You should go.

116
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:15,294
Chun-hui, let me drop you off.

117
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,630
Just go.

118
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:19,632
I'll drive her back.

119
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,813
Don't come back here ever again.

120
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,943
If you do,
the rest of them won't be able to work.

121
00:13:43,489 --> 00:13:45,407
I'm sorry, Chun-hui.

122
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,537
Apologies won't mean anything if you die.

123
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,917
Ok-dong's daughter
passed away while diving.

124
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:57,795
Hye-ja's mother passed away
while out at sea.

125
00:13:57,878 --> 00:14:00,464
I lost many friends too.

126
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,177
Get greedy out there, and you'll die.

127
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,931
And it won't be just you.
Everyone will die.

128
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:15,020
I'm sorry. This won't happen ever again.

129
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,649
Of course, it won't.

130
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,859
Today will be your last day.

131
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,323
I want to keep doing this.

132
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:31,537
Please tell me what I should do

133
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:34,373
-so I can stay.
-What?

134
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,877
Are you insane?
Do you want the others to die?

135
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:41,255
Haven't I told you several times

136
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,923
that we need to move as one?

137
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,677
You would've been long dead
had we not been around today.

138
00:14:47,428 --> 00:14:49,597
Instead of being grateful,

139
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,892
you're just a money-grubber who only
has her eyes on what's underwater.

140
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:55,311
You'd go so far
as to put yourself in danger.

141
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,064
-I'm sorry.
-How can I believe that?

142
00:14:59,148 --> 00:15:01,567
You've been lying
to everyone on this island.

143
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:05,321
I've never lied.

144
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,656
Don't lie through your teeth.

145
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:10,451
Should I call everyone over?

146
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,456
You said your parents were artists,
then said they were vendors in Dongdaemun.

147
00:15:15,539 --> 00:15:17,166
You always say different things.

148
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,753
Are they even alive to begin with?

149
00:15:23,464 --> 00:15:25,799
They passed away when I was 12.

150
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,140
They used to be artists.

151
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,518
They struggled to make ends meet.

152
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:38,938
So they sold clothes

153
00:15:39,688 --> 00:15:41,357
in Dongdaemun.

154
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,860
They overworked themselves
and got into a car accident.

155
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:52,159
I didn't tell the others about this

156
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,956
because unlike you, none of them
asked if my parents were still alive.

157
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:00,459
So I didn't see the need to tell them.

158
00:16:02,503 --> 00:16:05,381
I didn't want others to know
that I was an orphan.

159
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,342
I swear.

160
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,221
I've never lied to any of them.

161
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,057
I just answered their questions.

162
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,695
Do you have a man on the mainland?

163
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,363
Or a child?

164
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,659
I have neither.

165
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:36,870
Then why are you so greedy
about making money?

166
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,832
And who is calling you every day?

167
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,758
If you won't talk,
consider this your last day.

168
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,385
That's…

169
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:57,766
That's…

170
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:07,276
my one and only…

171
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:37,014
MI-RAN AND EUN-HUI 1

172
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:49,568
Look at the ceiling.

173
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,030
Or you'll hurt yourself.

174
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,450
See? What did I say?

175
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,212
A hat…

176
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,300
How do I look?

177
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:16,386
You look great in anything.

178
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:24,103
Who's the father
of your daughter who's in Paris?

179
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:26,480
Your first husband? Second?

180
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,815
Third?

181
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,069
She's graduating from university.
Of course, it's my first.

182
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:37,449
Not my second husband whom I divorced
ten years ago after two years of marriage.

183
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,871
Nor my third husband whom I divorced
a year ago after three months of marriage.

184
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,583
I'm sad to see you go.
You bring energy to this neighborhood.

185
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:48,335
Focus on your wife.

186
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,004
I've booked you

187
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:53,590
for Thursday evening at 6 p.m.

188
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:56,093
And even though I won't be around anymore,

189
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:59,346
Mr. Son will take over.

190
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:01,098
So please do stay.

191
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:03,517
And I'll give you the massage today.

192
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,894
I only come here for you.

193
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:08,605
Escort her to the VIP room.

194
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,691
-Okay. This way, please.
-I'll be there soon.

195
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:14,653
-Hello!
-Hello.

196
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,034
It's warm.

197
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,966
Your shoulders are too stiff.

198
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:41,388
If you're going to Paris
to attend your daughter's graduation,

199
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,140
why are you selling this place?

200
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:46,226
After attending her graduation,

201
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:52,357
we're going to travel
all around Europe and the Americas.

202
00:19:53,942 --> 00:19:56,195
It's her wish to travel the world.

203
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,740
Gosh.

204
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:03,493
She couldn't go on trips
since she was busy studying.

205
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:08,665
She'll be busy once again
when she joins a law firm in three months.

206
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,211
So I want
to spend time with her until then.

207
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,798
Then you can do so and come back.
Why are you leaving this place?

208
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:21,929
She's been living with my ex-husband
ever since our divorce,

209
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,098
so I couldn't do much for her then.

210
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:30,520
If I still keep this place,
I'll be distracted during my time there.

211
00:20:31,146 --> 00:20:32,856
I'd like some rest too.

212
00:20:34,066 --> 00:20:36,526
I agree.
You've been working all this time.

213
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:38,695
I understand.

214
00:20:39,446 --> 00:20:42,199
-When are you flying out?
-Tomorrow night.

215
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,535
-Bye. Thanks.
-No problem.

216
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,499
Ms. Ko!

217
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:53,627
Send me a video of the aurora in Iceland.

218
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:55,295
Okay. Stay safe!

219
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,860
Thank you. Goodbye.

220
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:22,322
Guys, let's have a late-night snack.

221
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,173
Mi-ran, are you emigrating or something?

222
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:44,219
Why are you packing clothes
for all four seasons?

223
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,346
And why so many presents?

224
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:48,390
The season for each country will vary.

225
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,434
I need to be prepared.

226
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:53,520
And those presents
are all for my daughter.

227
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:57,441
I think I should've bought more.

228
00:21:57,524 --> 00:22:00,360
You think the world
of your daughter indeed.

229
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,945
She's all you care about.

230
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:07,200
Her obsession with her own daughter
was the reason why we divorced.

231
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,954
Hey, get the facts straight.

232
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,291
We divorced because you took my money
to start a business that flopped.

233
00:22:14,374 --> 00:22:17,085
It had nothing to do
with my daughter, you scumbag.

234
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,296
-I paid you back.
-Not quite.

235
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,882
-I'll pay you the rest.
-You two should stop meeting up.

236
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:23,884
You're always bickering.

237
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,680
Hey, does your wife know
that you've invested in stocks?

238
00:22:28,764 --> 00:22:30,891
No, as long as you don't tell her.

239
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:31,933
Jeez.

240
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,478
I sense a divorce around the corner.

241
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,568
Oh, my. Speak of the devil.

242
00:22:41,651 --> 00:22:43,236
Give that to me.

243
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,654
It's my ex-husband.

244
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,406
First or third?

245
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:48,533
I don't meet up with the latter.

246
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,952
I should've done the same with you.

247
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,038
It's the first one. Ji-yun's dad.

248
00:22:56,458 --> 00:22:58,335
Hey, what is it?

249
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,129
Me?

250
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:03,924
I'm packing up for tomorrow's flight.

251
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,426
What's wrong with your voice?

252
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,769
We have some fresh hairtails.

253
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,897
Okay. We have ten boxes
of eels and hairtails.

254
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:22,067
We have ten boxes of eels and hairtails.

255
00:23:26,863 --> 00:23:29,324
We have 210,000 won and 215,000 won.
Sold to number 99.

256
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:31,701
Sold to number 99 for 215,000 won.

257
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:35,831
Two boxes of squids
and small hairtails for 4kg.

258
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:38,250
Two boxes of 4kg.

259
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:50,929
I bought enough hairtail, chub mackerel,
cuttlefish, and butterfish.

260
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,973
But there's no croaker
here at Daeheung Suhyup.

261
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,142
They couldn't catch much of it today.

262
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,478
That's right.
I can't buy any even though I want to.

263
00:23:58,562 --> 00:24:01,314
This is driving me insane.

264
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:04,568
The mart owner will flip out
if he finds out we couldn't get any.

265
00:24:04,651 --> 00:24:06,695
Stop doing business with Pureung Mart.

266
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:09,656
I mean, it's not like you told them
to hold a croaker special sale.

267
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,074
It was their choice.

268
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,494
They put up those banners to attract
customers. And now, they're pressuring us.

269
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,372
-Then will you talk to them?
-Sure. Don't worry about it.

270
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,959
UNCLE

271
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,212
Do you have hairtail?

272
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,839
I'm sorry. Please come by later.

273
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,132
We're not open right now.

274
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:30,051
Are you serious?

275
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:32,554
There he goes bugging me again.

276
00:24:34,472 --> 00:24:36,766
Hey, you got a call. It's your uncle.

277
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:39,978
What do you want?

278
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:44,357
When are you going to pick Mi-ran up?

279
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,486
Eun-hui, if Mi-ran is landing at 11 a.m.,

280
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:51,323
-shouldn't you head out right now?
-Eun-hui.

281
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,700
Aren't you going to pick her up?

282
00:24:54,367 --> 00:24:56,578
By the way, who is this "Mi-ran"?

283
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:59,122
Beats me. Why are you all
so concerned about her?

284
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:00,248
Hey.

285
00:25:01,666 --> 00:25:04,002
Why are you so curious about her?

286
00:25:05,045 --> 00:25:06,588
Jeez.

287
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:09,466
Worry about your late parents instead.

288
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,221
Why worry about her
when you're not even single?

289
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:16,598
Hey, I'm single!

290
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:19,351
-They're the ones who are still married.
-Shut up!

291
00:25:20,477 --> 00:25:23,271
Hey, Eun-hui isn't her slave.

292
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:27,234
You should call Mi-ran yourself
if you're that curious.

293
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,153
You shouldn't bother Eun-hui
so early in the morning

294
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:31,655
when she's busy with work.

295
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,867
So? When is she coming?

296
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:40,205
Hey, you better hurry!

297
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,583
Don't take your time!
You're a maid escorting her princess.

298
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,795
It's true.

299
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:49,256
Mi-ran is a princess, and you're her maid.

300
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:51,591
And I'm her henchman.

301
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:54,344
They're all her henchmen.

302
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:57,555
-Leave me out of this!
-Look at you.

303
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:01,643
Hey, safely escort our princess
to the mid-mountains, okay?

304
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,853
I'll take over from there.

305
00:26:06,022 --> 00:26:09,150
-Run!
-You scumbags.

306
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:21,871
Eun-hui, let me take one. They're heavy.

307
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:24,416
Hey, just come. Hurry up.

308
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,667
Jeez.

309
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,628
That's heavy. Be careful.

310
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:30,171
I'm fine.

311
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,174
It's the last one.

312
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,971
What's in this suitcase?

313
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:41,683
-Gosh.
-Done.

314
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,479
-Aren't I strong?
-My dear Eun-hui.

315
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,568
-Come here.
-I reek of fish.

316
00:26:51,651 --> 00:26:53,320
Come on. So what?

317
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,529
Gosh.

318
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:58,408
I like the smell of your perfume.

319
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,411
Has it been three years already?

320
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:05,540
I visited you in Seoul a year ago.
It's been three years since you came here.

321
00:27:05,623 --> 00:27:06,750
Is that so?

322
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:09,294
-Hop in.
-Okay.

323
00:27:09,377 --> 00:27:10,462
Wait.

324
00:27:10,545 --> 00:27:12,422
After you, Princess.

325
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,091
Jeez. Okay.

326
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:27,520
All right.

327
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:29,773
You've become prettier.

328
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,484
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

329
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,242
I've missed you, my best friend.

330
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:43,328
Me too.

331
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:48,375
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

332
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:52,128
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

333
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:00,387
This is so wonderful.

334
00:28:01,805 --> 00:28:04,849
We have everything you have in Seoul.

335
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,562
So why did you go
through the hassle of packing so much?

336
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:11,564
It's been ages since I last came.

337
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,526
I had to greet the elderly too,
so I couldn't come empty-handed.

338
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:18,905
So tell me. How have you been?

339
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,616
Gosh, that annoying man.

340
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:23,493
-He's driving me crazy.
-What's wrong?

341
00:28:24,661 --> 00:28:28,373
My uncle says my late dad
showed up in his dreams

342
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:32,168
and said he didn't like
where he was buried.

343
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,214
He told my uncle to carry out
a ritual or something.

344
00:28:36,297 --> 00:28:39,509
He's been giving me a headache,
calling day in, day out for money.

345
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:40,552
Hey.

346
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,180
Had your dad said that to him,
your uncle should have declined.

347
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:48,351
He should have said that you were
working like a dog to make ends meet.

348
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:51,438
Or he should've forced himself to wake up.

349
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:54,566
What the hell?
A ritual? Don't be ridiculous.

350
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:55,650
Jeez.

351
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,778
Hey, you went a bit too far.

352
00:28:59,612 --> 00:29:01,948
That's no way to talk
to an old man in his nineties.

353
00:29:02,031 --> 00:29:05,034
I'm not upset with him.
I just think having a ritual is ludicrous.

354
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,747
Just reject his call.

355
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:11,040
What? You actually rejected it.

356
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,629
Gosh.

357
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,006
-By the way,
-Jeez.

358
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:21,801
I thought you were going
on a world trip with Ji-yun.

359
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:23,219
So why are you here?

360
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,265
You see--

361
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:30,894
My gosh, is he serious?

362
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,187
Why is Jeong-sik calling?

363
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,772
He wants money for a new car.

364
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:34,773
What?

365
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,192
He's only had his for five years
but thinks it's rundown.

366
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:40,028
Then what does that make mine? A wreck?

367
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:43,239
-He's out of his mind.
-Seriously?

368
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:46,451
Why is everyone torturing you so much?

369
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:51,998
-Hey.
-Jeong-sik.

370
00:29:52,081 --> 00:29:54,209
Guess who this is.

371
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,712
What? Is it you, Mi-ran?

372
00:29:58,213 --> 00:30:01,549
Hey, Eun-hui told me
that you needed a new car.

373
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,092
Well, that's not it--

374
00:30:03,176 --> 00:30:05,553
What do you mean?
Are you saying I'm a liar?

375
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,265
Jeong-sik, there's a car
I've been driving.

376
00:30:09,349 --> 00:30:12,227
And the lease contract
will terminate soon.

377
00:30:12,310 --> 00:30:13,770
Do you want it?

378
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:16,731
-What?
-What? Are you serious?

379
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:19,359
I took great care of it,
so it looks pretty brand new.

380
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:20,985
It's a sports car at that.

381
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:24,364
You can lease it yourself
or purchase it at a cheap price.

382
00:30:24,447 --> 00:30:26,783
He doesn't need a sports car.

383
00:30:26,866 --> 00:30:29,327
It's secondhand. He'll be leasing it.

384
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,537
It's cheap.

385
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,665
But in return, promise me
you won't borrow money from Eun-hui.

386
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,084
Whether it's leasing or purchasing,
do it yourself.

387
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,210
All right.

388
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,046
Did you hear that, Eun-hui?
I don't need your money anymore.

389
00:30:40,129 --> 00:30:42,632
I wish you were my sister, Mi-ran.

390
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,259
That little…

391
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,804
Gosh, that's funny.

392
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:56,521
He's still a kid.

393
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,816
He's a father of two.
He should've matured long ago.

394
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,780
Anyway,

395
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:09,158
why aren't you going on that trip again?

396
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:12,996
You see,

397
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,749
-Ji-yun…
-Yes?

398
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:20,837
Just stop doing business with them
like Jeong-jun said.

399
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,171
You didn't have to call me.

400
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:25,049
Okay.

401
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:27,093
I'm busy right now.

402
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,846
I'll head that way later.

403
00:31:30,805 --> 00:31:31,973
See you.

404
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,975
Don't worry about me and just tell me.

405
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:38,813
I thought you wanted
to grant Ji-yun's wish.

406
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:40,523
So why didn't you go?

407
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,235
Just because.

408
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:48,406
-It was due to my work.
-Damn it!

409
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:50,116
That scumbag.

410
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,368
How rude.

411
00:31:56,372 --> 00:32:00,752
I heard Westerners take
graduation ceremonies very seriously.

412
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:04,589
What will her friends think?
You should've been there.

413
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:08,468
That's more important than work.

414
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:12,221
You're right.

415
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:16,851
It just so happened.

416
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,747
Mi-ran!

417
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:39,666
Hey!

418
00:32:41,167 --> 00:32:43,711
Hey! I heard you're going to be a grandpa!

419
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,047
I can't believe it! Congratulations!

420
00:32:51,761 --> 00:32:54,347
-Hey, whose car is this?
-It's Myeong-bo's.

421
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:58,017
He was bummed out that he couldn't
come to see her due to work.

422
00:32:58,101 --> 00:33:00,186
So he told me to pick her up in his car.

423
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:01,729
What's with that outfit?

424
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:05,149
Hey, it's my first time meeting Mi-ran,
my first love, in three years.

425
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,693
I had to get dressed up.

426
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,153
You're the best.

427
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,114
You too, Mi-ran.

428
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:12,323
-Eun-hui.
-Yes?

429
00:33:12,407 --> 00:33:15,201
I'll call you after I say hi
to the ladies. Let's have dinner.

430
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:17,245
-I'll prepare some raw fish.
-Okay.

431
00:33:18,871 --> 00:33:20,498
-See you in the evening.
-Okay.

432
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:22,792
Bye.

433
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,155
Come on.

434
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,449
Damn it.

435
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:00,580
What a selfish brat.

436
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,836
Her ex-husband had raised
their daughter all this time.

437
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,839
What did she do for her?

438
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,427
All she did was hurt her
by getting three divorces.

439
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,682
Her daughter had wanted her
to attend her graduation.

440
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,352
But what? She had no time due to work?

441
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:28,066
How did she find time to come here?

442
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:33,696
How dare she use that as her excuse?

443
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:37,075
Gosh, what a self-centered brat.

444
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:48,002
These are handmade cookies
from Cheongdam-dong.

445
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:51,422
-Gosh…
-And this…

446
00:34:51,506 --> 00:34:54,801
Look. I made these cookies myself.

447
00:34:57,011 --> 00:35:00,515
And these. These will help invigorate you.

448
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:01,974
Make sure you have them.

449
00:35:02,058 --> 00:35:04,852
-Goodness.
-And this is

450
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,437
a vest!

451
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,440
Goodness.

452
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:12,235
Take one each. These are socks.

453
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:14,278
-Goodness.
-They're very warm.

454
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:16,489
And this.

455
00:35:18,699 --> 00:35:20,535
I've put some money in here for you.

456
00:35:20,618 --> 00:35:23,704
Look at that! I'm so proud of you, Mi-ran!

457
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:26,874
Just seeing your face is enough.
Take this back.

458
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,084
Come on.

459
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:29,877
-Come on.
-Keep it.

460
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,630
Just keep it, my goodness.

461
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:37,760
We have dried bracken,
burdock, and zucchini.

462
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,721
We dried them up this spring
to give them to you. Take them.

463
00:35:48,229 --> 00:35:50,022
It smells like you.

464
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,776
This is just great.

465
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:01,159
What? What's that?

466
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:02,076
-What?
-What?

467
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,751
What are you doing? Take this.

468
00:36:11,919 --> 00:36:12,962
Jeez.

469
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,549
You've fulfilled your duties as a mother.

470
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:20,595
You paid for her tuition

471
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,222
and got her a place there.

472
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:25,850
You only divorced her father
because he had cheated.

473
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:29,520
So what did you do so wrong
that she doesn't want you to come?

474
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,273
Her stepmother

475
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:35,735
was her professor.

476
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,197
Chew it well.

477
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,702
She was also the one who introduced
Ji-yun to her current boyfriend.

478
00:36:45,786 --> 00:36:46,954
That's why.

479
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:52,543
She just wants to go on a trip
with those around her.

480
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,631
I was the unwelcome guest.

481
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,052
Well…

482
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:03,429
I get it.

483
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,515
But why didn't she tell me that herself?

484
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:09,435
Why did she make her dad do it?

485
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,402
She probably didn't want to disappoint me.

486
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,114
I understand her now.

487
00:37:24,158 --> 00:37:25,743
She's kindhearted like that.

488
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,829
I bet she is if she took after you.

489
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,624
Sit up straight.
You'll get an upset stomach.

490
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:32,583
Okay.

491
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:37,213
Are your parents and brother
doing well in the States?

492
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:38,923
Yes. Totally.

493
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:42,551
They're an ideal family except for me.

494
00:37:45,554 --> 00:37:46,847
What?

495
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,182
CONSONANTS AND VOWELS

496
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,477
I bought that for you
when I came here three years ago.

497
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:54,522
Have you mastered them?

498
00:37:54,605 --> 00:37:57,441
Ok-dong isn't that bright.

499
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:58,484
Come on.

500
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,445
She's right. I'm a bit stupid.

501
00:38:11,497 --> 00:38:14,292
-A hunter
-A hunter

502
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:15,418
Why are you laughing?

503
00:38:16,085 --> 00:38:18,170
-It's Eun-gi, Man-su's kid.
-No way!

504
00:38:20,214 --> 00:38:21,299
Goodness.

505
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:23,217
My, look at her!

506
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,344
Gosh!

507
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:27,013
She's so adorable.

508
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:30,016
Not at all. She's a nuisance.

509
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:34,812
Man-su will be moving here
this winter or the beginning of next year.

510
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,522
-Really?
-Yes.

511
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,318
Goodness. He's finally come to his senses.

512
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:43,237
Look at that.
Things are finally looking up for you.

513
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:46,365
Not at all. I'll be suffering from now on.

514
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:52,413
Goodness. She's so cute.

515
00:38:52,496 --> 00:38:54,290
Why do you like Mi-ran so much?

516
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,210
What? Do you think
she'd marry you if you adored her?

517
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:02,590
Hey, why do you always
dislike her so much?

518
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:05,384
She's one sly girl.

519
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:07,470
What are they doing?

520
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,513
It's okay. This is fun.

521
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:13,351
Let's eavesdrop on them.

522
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,728
She made Eun-hui carry her bag
when they were kids.

523
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:17,897
She still takes advantage of her.

524
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:22,109
Even today, why did Eun-hui have
to leave work to pick her up?

525
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:23,778
Mi-ran could've called a cab.

526
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:28,074
Hey, she hadn't visited in three years.
That wouldn't have been right.

527
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,533
And Eun-hui has a car.

528
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:34,121
If I were Eun-hui, I would've done more
than just pick Mi-ran up.

529
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:36,707
I would've gladly washed
her underwear too.

530
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:39,502
On top of that,

531
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:43,130
Eun-hui owes Mi-ran big time.

532
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:45,049
And so does Mi-ran.

533
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:48,219
Mi-ran's entire family
had emigrated to the States.

534
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:50,513
Eun-hui closed her store
and traveled to Seoul

535
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,057
to help Mi-ran
with all three of her weddings.

536
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:56,268
She even helped take care
of Mi-ran's daughter after she gave birth.

537
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:58,896
I'm well aware of that. I can hear you.

538
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:00,398
Jeez.

539
00:40:00,481 --> 00:40:02,900
Just shut it and fix the roof.

540
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,112
Eun-hui and I are one.

541
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:09,323
We're loyal friends
who always help each other when in need.

542
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:14,245
So why do you guys always come between us?

543
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,205
How annoying.

544
00:40:16,831 --> 00:40:18,332
You little…

545
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:20,876
Get back to work.

546
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:26,173
Whatever.

547
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:28,134
She thinks they're one?

548
00:40:28,926 --> 00:40:30,010
"Loyal"?

549
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,013
Eun-hui is the only loyal one.
She knows nothing about loyalty.

550
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,140
What a brat.

551
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:35,808
Hey.

552
00:40:36,684 --> 00:40:38,477
Watch what you say.

553
00:40:39,937 --> 00:40:44,108
Don't get involved if you don't know
what Mi-ran did to Eun-hui.

554
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,162
-Here.
-Okay.

555
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,582
How is it?

556
00:41:00,082 --> 00:41:01,125
It's a bit bland.

557
00:41:01,208 --> 00:41:02,751
-Should I add more soy sauce?
-Yes.

558
00:41:05,671 --> 00:41:07,423
-Hello.
-Hi. You don't have to get up.

559
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,591
-Hello.
-Hi.

560
00:41:08,674 --> 00:41:10,342
-Do you want some tea?
-I'm okay.

561
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:14,430
Look at that. You're preparing raw fish.

562
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,183
Sorry, but Mi-ran isn't here.

563
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,643
She's visiting Ok-dong and Chun-hui.

564
00:41:20,352 --> 00:41:21,437
I see.

565
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,193
-Is that fresh?
-Of course, it is.

566
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,029
Did you think I'd use a rotten one?

567
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:38,037
This is striped beakfish.
Mi-ran's favorite.

568
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,832
So is this one. Mi-ran's favorite.

569
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,001
Eun-hui.

570
00:41:45,085 --> 00:41:47,713
What's gotten into you?
Why are you so irritable today?

571
00:41:47,796 --> 00:41:48,964
It's menopause.

572
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,260
Just leave already.

573
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,304
Mi-ran isn't here. Don't bother me.

574
00:41:56,222 --> 00:41:58,474
Do your colleagues think
you're working right now?

575
00:41:58,557 --> 00:42:00,434
I work hard, you know?

576
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:04,813
By the way,

577
00:42:05,898 --> 00:42:07,441
for tomorrow's reunion--

578
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,109
Don't you dare think

579
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,487
about meeting Mi-ran
behind your wife's back.

580
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:13,697
She called me a while ago, so I told her

581
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,699
where we were gathering tomorrow.

582
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,119
Really?

583
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,121
Then…

584
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,667
See you tomorrow. Bye.

585
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:27,878
You're a married man! Act like one!

586
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:29,713
Unbelievable.

587
00:42:30,339 --> 00:42:32,174
They're all infatuated with Mi-ran

588
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,969
and don't take
their own situations into account.

589
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:37,721
I guess they're still men after all.

590
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,348
How ridiculous.

591
00:42:41,392 --> 00:42:44,353
She must have been very popular
back in the day.

592
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,399
How did you guys become so close?

593
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,860
Judging by that photo,
it's hard to believe you're friends.

594
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:55,864
I thought the same thing.
They're totally different.

595
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,450
They're such an odd pair.

596
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:04,373
Really?

597
00:43:05,207 --> 00:43:06,542
Why are we an odd pair?

598
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:08,877
We're a great fit.

599
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:12,590
She's a princess, and I'm her maid.
We're a perfect pair.

600
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,353
Hey, Mi-ran. Why aren't you here already?

601
00:43:26,854 --> 00:43:28,230
Dinner's ready.

602
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,566
What?

603
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,696
You should've told me in advance
if you were going to eat there!

604
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:38,282
You said you were only going to say hi.

605
00:43:43,078 --> 00:43:44,955
Fine. Okay.

606
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,583
Hang up and have fun.

607
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:52,463
I'll come to pick you up later.

608
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:54,923
Bye.

609
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:01,305
You should go.

610
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:04,475
Take the food.

611
00:44:14,652 --> 00:44:17,529
What was that? She's eating there
when we've cooked already?

612
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,739
I know.

613
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:21,700
Let's clean up, Byeol-i.

614
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:25,371
She should've let Eun-hui know
even if they are close.

615
00:44:25,913 --> 00:44:27,247
How rude of her!

616
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:48,936
DIARY 1

617
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,574
The everlasting star of Pureung.

618
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,743
My best friend.

619
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:08,038
Ko Mi-ran has returned to Pureung
after three years.

620
00:45:11,625 --> 00:45:13,210
That was so close.

621
00:45:14,128 --> 00:45:16,463
All right, then.

622
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,674
It's my turn, young ones.

623
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,217
You're not older than them.

624
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,721
I don't like Mi-ran.

625
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:28,434
She's one poor girl. Be nice to her.

626
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,518
Let's see.

627
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,061
Hurry up.

628
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:33,480
What's it to you? You're not even playing.

629
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,817
Myeong-bo, shouldn't you go home?

630
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,027
Isn't In-jeong waiting for you?

631
00:45:39,111 --> 00:45:40,988
It's okay.

632
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:43,282
Okay. Get ready for this.

633
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,410
-What?
-Okay.

634
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,000
Look!

635
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,085
Whenever she's here,

636
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:59,256
everyone is elated, and they all love her.

637
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,593
Whenever Ms. Kang sees her,

638
00:46:03,427 --> 00:46:06,054
she adores her
as if she's her late daughter, Dong-i.

639
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:10,434
Ms. Hyeon's late son,
Man-yeong, who died after falling

640
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:13,562
into a furrow drunk,
used to be in love with Mi-ran.

641
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:17,983
Ms. Hyeon's heart breaks since she
considers Mi-ran her daughter-in-law.

642
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:21,236
As for In-gwon and Myeong-bo,

643
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:25,407
they become at least 30 years younger
when she's around.

644
00:46:25,991 --> 00:46:29,119
They have butterflies in their stomachs
like they did in the past.

645
00:46:30,078 --> 00:46:31,997
They become ecstatic around her.

646
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,295
But what about me?

647
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,798
Just like how she feels about me,

648
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:46,929
do I also miss her
and think of her as my best friend?

649
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:49,306
Am I truly happy when I see her?

650
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,612
That was the case in the past.

651
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:06,281
I was always happy around her.

652
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:09,284
-How do I look?
-Hey, it's Eun-hui.

653
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:11,870
-Walking again?
-Again?

654
00:47:11,954 --> 00:47:13,247
No money for the bus again?

655
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:15,290
You better hurry.

656
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:17,334
Don't let the geezers
catch you being tardy.

657
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:20,170
Gosh, check out those robust legs.

658
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,381
-They look so strong.
-Seriously.

659
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,174
Look at her.

660
00:47:24,258 --> 00:47:26,510
-Hey, run.
-Hurry up.

661
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,679
-You're going to be late.
-Hey!

662
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:32,975
Get in.

663
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:37,145
-What's her deal? Why is she getting in?
-Seriously?

664
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:38,522
What's going on?

665
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,276
What great timing.

666
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,154
-This is yours.
-A sandwich.

667
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,116
You guys can take the bus!

668
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:50,742
Good luck!

669
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:54,913
Since I was poor,

670
00:47:54,997 --> 00:47:57,916
she was a wealthy friend
that I could rely on.

671
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:03,130
She saved me several times
from being humiliated.

672
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:07,092
Drink this. I only added one drop.

673
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,136
You'll be fine once you throw up.

674
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:18,061
You better come back soon.

675
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:19,187
Okay.

676
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:35,787
AGRICULTURAL PESTICIDE

677
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:40,917
It's all on you if she dies!

678
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,545
Everyone goes to high school nowadays!

679
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,672
It's all your fault!

680
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:48,717
Eun-hui!

681
00:48:49,301 --> 00:48:50,344
I'm sorry!

682
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:53,722
I promise to send you to high school!

683
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,184
So please don't die on me!

684
00:48:57,684 --> 00:48:59,936
Had Mi-ran not helped me that day,

685
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,065
I would've never been able
to attend high school.

686
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,736
I won't ever forget
what you did for me today.

687
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:11,531
Loyalty.

688
00:49:12,532 --> 00:49:13,492
Loyalty.

689
00:49:13,992 --> 00:49:18,497
I truly meant it
when I vowed my loyalty to her that day.

690
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:30,634
I had to drop out of high school
due to my family's financial situation.

691
00:49:31,343 --> 00:49:33,428
But I was still able to take the GED

692
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:35,389
and graduate high school

693
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,974
all thanks to my smart friend, Mi-ran.

694
00:49:39,184 --> 00:49:40,811
If I only consider those things,

695
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:45,691
I'm a traitor
for feeling this way about her.

696
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:47,109
Why are you here?

697
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,569
Hey.

698
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,781
Mi-ran asked me to drive
because everyone was drunk.

699
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,492
None of the others drank. It was only her.

700
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,373
Get in.

701
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,874
Get in, my best friend.

702
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:04,876
Just go. It'll be too packed.

703
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:06,795
Eun-hui, just get in.

704
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:10,716
Why did you drink so much?
I need to go to work tomorrow.

705
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:15,971
Come on. All you do is sell fish,
so what's the big deal?

706
00:50:16,054 --> 00:50:17,305
I'll buy them all.

707
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,975
So let's just have fun tonight.

708
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,476
Hey.

709
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,228
Watch your tongue.

710
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,814
What's the big deal?
Are you looking down on her job?

711
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,692
That's enough. She just wants to have fun.

712
00:50:34,114 --> 00:50:37,367
Had you not been here, she and I
would've gotten into a fight already.

713
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:38,660
Let's go!

714
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,254
To the sea!

715
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,966
I want to get out.

716
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,219
Over there.

717
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,431
It's the sea.

718
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:00,932
It's the sea!

719
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,854
Wait up!

720
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:23,330
I thought I would love her forever

721
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,624
because of what she did for me.

722
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,461
And I valued loyalty.

723
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:34,716
That's why I gladly helped her
with all three of her weddings.

724
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:36,426
I also closed my store

725
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:39,679
and went to Seoul to help her recover
after she gave birth.

726
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:42,474
I didn't think of it as a hassle.
I thought it was expected.

727
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:44,267
However…

728
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:46,478
Eun-hui!

729
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,271
Eun-hui!

730
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:52,484
Turn the music up! I can't hear it!

731
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:14,798
Do it yourself!

732
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,218
Is she your slave?
You always make her do everything!

733
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:32,649
How can you be so forgiving?

734
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,694
Did you forget what happened that day?

735
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,156
There are no sausages? Then don't eat it.

736
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:45,745
I was just pointing out
that there weren't any sausages.

737
00:52:45,829 --> 00:52:47,122
I wasn't complaining…

738
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:59,301
Hey, what was that?

739
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:02,596
She didn't even eat breakfast,
so why did you throw that away?

740
00:53:11,104 --> 00:53:14,691
You're always complaining
when it's my food you're eating.

741
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:16,735
You're a moocher.

742
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,489
That's when I realized her true face.

743
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:22,949
Are you serious?

744
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:24,618
"A moocher"?

745
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,828
How could she say that to her friend?

746
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:30,957
That was nothing.

747
00:53:32,751 --> 00:53:34,085
Nothing?

748
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:38,006
Was there something more?

749
00:53:41,426 --> 00:53:43,386
Jeez, this is so frustrating.

750
00:53:53,855 --> 00:53:57,400
That was really not a big deal,
and I let it pass.

751
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:04,324
We had shared countless memories,
and I had loyalty.

752
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:07,994
But a year ago,

753
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:13,208
there was an incident
after she had her third divorce.

754
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,752
And I couldn't forgive her.

755
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,632
Mi-ran, why aren't you
answering your phone?

756
00:54:21,466 --> 00:54:22,676
Mi-ran.

757
00:54:22,759 --> 00:54:25,428
You can't say that you want to die
and that you miss me,

758
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,764
and then not pick up my calls.

759
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,892
Call me as soon as you get this.

760
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:32,811
You have to.

761
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:34,938
Damn it!

762
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:08,138
Thirty-fifth floor.

763
00:55:08,221 --> 00:55:09,806
Door closing.

764
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:15,353
The number you have called
cannot be reached.

765
00:55:15,437 --> 00:55:17,689
Please leave a message after the beep.

766
00:55:18,273 --> 00:55:21,192
Mi-ran, I'll be arriving
at your house soon.

767
00:55:22,027 --> 00:55:26,823
After getting your text,
I hurried over from Jeju.

768
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:29,117
Mi-ran.

769
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,953
Getting divorced three times
isn't a big deal.

770
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:35,373
Okay? You have me.

771
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,251
Mi-ran.

772
00:55:39,377 --> 00:55:41,713
Mi-ran, please don't die.

773
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,716
Please don't die.

774
00:55:45,717 --> 00:55:46,885
Mi-ran…

775
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:03,109
Mi-ran.

776
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:08,698
Mi-ran?

777
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,535
Mi-ran.

778
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,580
Oh, no. Mi-ran…

779
00:56:16,664 --> 00:56:18,917
What should I do? Mi-ran!

780
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:27,926
Eun-hui! Did you all see that?

781
00:56:28,009 --> 00:56:31,096
My friend came all the way from Jeju!

782
00:56:31,179 --> 00:56:32,263
Lucky you.

783
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:35,141
-Eun-hui!
-We made a bet.

784
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:39,479
"Who would be loyal enough
to rush all the way here to Seoul?"

785
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:41,815
And it's you!

786
00:56:42,398 --> 00:56:43,942
Hey, be quiet.

787
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,444
She doesn't know them,
so let me introduce her.

788
00:56:47,028 --> 00:56:50,990
This girl is always at my beck and call.

789
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:53,535
She's the biggest doormat ever.

790
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:56,121
It's Jung Eun-hui!

791
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,624
You're so much better than her ex-husband.

792
00:56:59,707 --> 00:57:01,376
Right. Who's drinking the shot?

793
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,294
Four shots. Make four shots.

794
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:06,256
You need to drink
all of them at once. Is it you?

795
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:14,722
Eun-hui!

796
00:57:15,306 --> 00:57:16,558
Eun-hui!

797
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:21,771
This girl is always at my beck and call.

798
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:24,065
She's the biggest doormat ever.

799
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:28,570
This girl is always at my beck and call.

800
00:57:28,653 --> 00:57:31,906
She's the biggest doormat ever…

801
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,995
Eun-hui!

802
00:57:40,999 --> 00:57:42,584
Eun-hui.

803
00:57:43,877 --> 00:57:45,628
You know,

804
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,923
I'm so happy

805
00:57:50,175 --> 00:57:51,926
that I have you,

806
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,679
my friend.

807
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,807
That's when I realized

808
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,685
that I wasn't her friend.

809
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:06,107
I was just a doormat
who was always at her beck and call.

810
00:58:06,191 --> 00:58:09,736
Her minion. Her slave. Her maid.

811
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,406
How obnoxious. How selfish.

812
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,867
She pretends to be a close friend,

813
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:18,411
yet treats me like her minion.

814
00:58:19,078 --> 00:58:20,622
What a two-faced brat.

815
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:43,811
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

816
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,659
Don't let it show.

817
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,370
Just keep treating her the same way.

818
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:05,917
Eun-hui, did I ever upset you?

819
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:12,799
Let's have a blast today.

820
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,426
Remember the legendary duo?

821
00:59:16,177 --> 00:59:19,806
Mi-ran is always flirting
with any guy she can find.

822
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:21,432
-That's enough!
-Let go!

823
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:23,101
Why is having fun so important?

824
00:59:23,977 --> 00:59:26,521
This is life. There are good and bad days.

825
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:29,983
The arrival time is 3 p.m.
Make sure you're there.

826
00:59:30,066 --> 00:59:31,359
I trust you.

827
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,112
But I guess you don't trust me.

828
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:41,578
