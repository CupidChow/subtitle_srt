1
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:27,193
YEONG-OK AND JEONG-JUN

2
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,195
DONG-SEOK AND SEON-A,
YEONG-OK AND JEONG-JUN

3
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:03,980
DONG-SEOK AND SEON-A,
YEONG-OK AND JEONG-JUN

4
00:01:17,952 --> 00:01:20,121
Thank you. Have a good one.

5
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,269
I wonder if my mom's also like you.

6
00:01:45,855 --> 00:01:47,941
The whole time we were together,

7
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:52,320
I couldn't help but ask myself this.

8
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:59,744
"I wonder if my mom has ever loved me

9
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:06,918
as much as you love your son, Yeol."

10
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,798
It just made me wonder.

11
00:02:13,341 --> 00:02:16,344
Do I seem stupid and crazy
for talking about this

12
00:02:16,427 --> 00:02:18,721
when I'm way over 40 years old?

13
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,810
Not at all.

14
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:27,856
You can call me crazy if you want.

15
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:30,650
I just became curious.

16
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:36,573
I wonder what goes through her head
whenever she looks at me.

17
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:40,702
If you're so curious, just ask her.

18
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,248
No way.

19
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:58,720
After my dad passed away,

20
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:02,682
my head was filled with so many questions.

21
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,145
"Did Dad hate me?"

22
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:12,734
"He always told me that
he loved me more than anyone."

23
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:16,654
"But was that all a lie?"

24
00:03:19,282 --> 00:03:21,200
"Why would he leave his beloved daughter

25
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:25,121
and drive his car right into the sea?"

26
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:31,044
Then I came to a conclusion.

27
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:34,464
Although he loved me,

28
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:38,009
life must've been

29
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:41,596
unimaginably hard for him
to do such a thing.

30
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,143
Then I started resenting him again.

31
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:51,439
He should've told me that
he was struggling.

32
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,817
Then I would've at least hugged him.

33
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:02,116
"Dad, you have me. Don't feel lonely."
That's what I would've said.

34
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:05,119
I would've tried so hard
to make him smile.

35
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,376
But after some time,

36
00:04:13,211 --> 00:04:15,922
I started to blame myself

37
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,383
for not asking how he was.

38
00:04:20,969 --> 00:04:23,471
Whenever he got drunk
and fought with my uncle,

39
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,682
I should've gone inside

40
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:30,353
and asked him what was wrong
and why he was so angry.

41
00:04:31,646 --> 00:04:34,065
I should've asked him what it was

42
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,859
that gave him such a hard time.

43
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,445
I regret that I never asked.

44
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,493
You should ask your mom.

45
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,290
Ask her why she neglected you

46
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,459
even though you were her son.

47
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,172
If you don't ask,
you'll regret it like me.

48
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,633
Regret, my foot. Forget it.

49
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,469
I prefer things the way they are.

50
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,222
When she dies, I'll hold her funeral.

51
00:05:07,598 --> 00:05:10,143
That woman never talks.

52
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,272
She never even says hello to me

53
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:17,608
whenever she sees me at the market.

54
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,069
Do you think she'll answer me
if I ask her that?

55
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,404
This is what she'll do.

56
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,490
"What is this punk saying?"

57
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:29,120
She will think that in her head
and stare at me like this.

58
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,289
There's no way I'm asking her.

59
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:39,339
By the way, did you ever think of me?

60
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:44,719
You switch from one subject to another.

61
00:05:45,636 --> 00:05:48,639
-What's with you?
-Did you think of me?

62
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,476
Sometimes.

63
00:05:52,351 --> 00:05:55,104
-Not all the time?
-Just sometimes.

64
00:05:55,772 --> 00:05:59,650
Can't you just lie and tell me that
you thought of me all the time?

65
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:01,527
-Unbelievable.
-I'm a bad liar.

66
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,654
At least give it a try.

67
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,784
I thought of you all the time.
You were always on my mind.

68
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,410
Gosh, you punk.

69
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,706
What made you think of me all the time?

70
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:16,042
I just couldn't stop.

71
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:39,565
It's a nice neighborhood. It's quiet.

72
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:45,780
But I must say…

73
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:49,992
this feels really weird.

74
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:55,456
We're not at a motel or a deserted house.

75
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,584
We're not in my old room.

76
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:01,796
We're not at the arcade
or out in the street.

77
00:07:03,172 --> 00:07:06,050
You're in the kitchen,
and I'm in the living room.

78
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,802
It's…

79
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:10,930
It feels so strange.

80
00:07:13,391 --> 00:07:14,392
Why?

81
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:17,145
I mean, it's just…

82
00:07:19,063 --> 00:07:21,566
We look like a completely ordinary couple.

83
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,403
Like those who have
moved in together or are dating.

84
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:30,324
We look like an actual couple
who have a home.

85
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:34,996
You should get married.

86
00:07:36,747 --> 00:07:38,499
I guess you want to settle down.

87
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,002
It'd be nice to get married.

88
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:46,507
Honey, can I get a glass of water?

89
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,556
I want to be near Yeol.

90
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:04,984
A friend of mine is opening
an interior design company,

91
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,445
and he asked me to join.

92
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,780
So I have a job now.

93
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:18,456
So you have no reason to go back to Jeju?

94
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:21,375
No.

95
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,597
Then you should stay.

96
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:37,475
A mother should be with her child.

97
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:42,522
But when did you make this decision?

98
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,817
This morning while watching the sunrise.

99
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:56,118
That was when I started
falling for you again.

100
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:59,956
But you were busy deciding to stay.

101
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,469
What about the deserted house?
You paid for a year in advance.

102
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,556
I'm not sure.

103
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:18,391
Let me live there.

104
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,520
Sure, that'd be great.

105
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,652
Where is your room?

106
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,493
-I'd rather not go in there.
-Why?

107
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:40,621
I only have bad memories of that room.

108
00:09:41,205 --> 00:09:42,039
I see.

109
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:44,417
Your ex-husband.

110
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:47,461
Yeol's room is over there.

111
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,256
I'm thinking about sleeping there.

112
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,136
Or I could sleep on the sofa.

113
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,138
Can I take a look at his room?

114
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:12,028
Can I take a look at your room too?

115
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,084
Seon-a, how about
I bring your bed out to the living room?

116
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:40,806
Make sure you do it right.

117
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:42,808
Don't say that when I'm doing just fine.

118
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:44,560
It's really demotivating.

119
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,188
Okay, I'll stop.

120
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,357
You're doing great.

121
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,112
Seriously.

122
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,493
-Come here.
-No, stop.

123
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,726
Do you like it, ma'am?

124
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,770
Yes, it's nice.

125
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,965
I made fried dumplings, your favorites.

126
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,342
Eat this and get some sleep.

127
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,345
You didn't sleep a wink because of me.

128
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:07,393
You can take the ferry
from Mokpo to Jeju tomorrow morning.

129
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:08,978
So get some sleep.

130
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:11,147
Okay, sounds good.

131
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:26,954
This is delicious.

132
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,748
Isn't it hot?

133
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:33,335
I was starving. It's nice and crispy.

134
00:12:37,756 --> 00:12:40,426
-Put the towel where it belongs.
-Okay.

135
00:13:16,253 --> 00:13:17,546
Whenever…

136
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,549
you need an old friend, call me.

137
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:24,929
Call me if you need
an extra hand like today.

138
00:13:26,805 --> 00:13:30,559
If you ever feel like
coming to Jeju for some raw fish,

139
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:35,272
-or you feel like going on a trip--
-If I get lonely,

140
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:38,984
I'll call you.

141
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:43,364
You promise?

142
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,366
I promise.

143
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:54,708
Keep yourself busy like you did today.

144
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:57,169
It'll make you sleepy.

145
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:02,091
When there's a lot on your mind,
just keep yourself super busy.

146
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,260
I stay busy every day.

147
00:14:05,219 --> 00:14:06,971
Otherwise, I think too much.

148
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,223
Thinking too much is bad for anyone.

149
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,893
If this house feels too big,

150
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,395
move to a smaller place.

151
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:19,358
If everything around you turns dark
even in broad daylight--

152
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:20,776
"It's an illusion."

153
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:25,114
I'll tell myself that out loud.

154
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:28,993
And if that doesn't work,

155
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:33,122
I'll call you.

156
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,666
Then I'll curse at you big time.

157
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,085
I'll say, "Wake up, you punk!"

158
00:14:43,424 --> 00:14:44,466
I'll…

159
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,554
call you often.

160
00:14:51,307 --> 00:14:53,976
Stop making empty promises
and just go to sleep.

161
00:16:29,571 --> 00:16:30,864
See? That's much better.

162
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:18,287
DONG-SEOK

163
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:29,548
Seon-a, I'm off to catch the night ferry.
I didn't want to wake you.

164
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,468
I'll send your car back from Jeju.

165
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:37,097
If you ever need an old friend, call me.

166
00:17:37,181 --> 00:17:38,432
That little…

167
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:41,185
Call me if you ever need a hand
with anything.

168
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,438
Call me if you get lonely.

169
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:49,193
And if your depression kicks in
and things turn pitch black, call me.

170
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:51,737
Try your best to live.

171
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,907
Seon-a.

172
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,910
Thanks to you, I believe in next time now.

173
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:00,537
I hope

174
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,040
we meet again next time.

175
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,459
Until then, good luck.

176
00:18:21,975 --> 00:18:24,436
Yeol, are you not going to
accept my apology?

177
00:18:28,482 --> 00:18:29,775
Will you accept it?

178
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,279
Then why do you look so down?

179
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:37,074
You're not even smiling for me.

180
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:39,535
No reason.

181
00:18:45,249 --> 00:18:46,333
Yeol.

182
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,213
-Do you know that I'm sick?
-Yes.

183
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:56,635
That's why you can't play with me.

184
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,222
That's why I have to live with Dad.

185
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,935
But you'll live with me over the holidays.

186
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,937
-Right?
-Yes.

187
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:12,734
Yeol, do you still get scared of the dark
when you go to bed at night?

188
00:19:13,986 --> 00:19:15,404
Yes, a lot.

189
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,991
What do you do then?

190
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:22,411
I sleep with the lights on,
and I hug the horse.

191
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,914
-Does that help?
-Yes.

192
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,210
That's good to hear.

193
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,881
But you see, Yeol,

194
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:38,927
I feel like I'm in the dark
even during the day.

195
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,224
Even when I'm surrounded

196
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:47,269
by bright lights just like now,

197
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:51,315
if I get sick,

198
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,359
it all just turns dark.

199
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,613
Even if you turn the lights on?

200
00:20:16,673 --> 00:20:20,802
But even then, if I'm with you…

201
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,520
it doesn't scare me at all.

202
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,482
To me,

203
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:35,901
you will always be

204
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,612
my shining star.

205
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,448
You can sleep with this.

206
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,576
No, this belongs to you.

207
00:20:46,119 --> 00:20:47,412
Instead, give me a hug.

208
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,586
Don't be sick.

209
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,758
I'm sorry I hurt your arm.

210
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,469
And I want you to know

211
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:05,722
that I love you so much.

212
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:07,724
Yeol.

213
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:41,633
You're going to file an appeal,
aren't you?

214
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:48,473
I guess Yeol will see us fighting again.

215
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,350
When is it going to be?

216
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,105
Not now. Later.

217
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,401
When I'm feeling better.

218
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,244
I don't want to do it

219
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,790
just because I can't live without Yeol.

220
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:19,629
I'll do it when he can't live without me.

221
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:23,216
I'll file it then.

222
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:27,387
Not when I'm the one…

223
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,767
who needs a hug

224
00:22:32,976 --> 00:22:34,978
from Yeol like I did today.

225
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,899
I'll do it

226
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,401
when Yeol needs a hug from me.

227
00:22:44,154 --> 00:22:45,989
Not when Yeol thinks of me…

228
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,956
as a weak mom.

229
00:22:57,125 --> 00:22:58,752
I'll do it when he thinks…

230
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:03,131
I'm the strongest person in the world.

231
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:07,552
When he wants to rely on me.

232
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,182
That's when I'll do it.

233
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,400
Not when Yeol is

234
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:26,321
the only hope in my life.

235
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,786
When I'm the hope of his life.

236
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,373
That's when I'll file an appeal.

237
00:23:40,043 --> 00:23:42,129
If that day ever comes, forget the appeal.

238
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:44,965
I'll let you raise Yeol.

239
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,222
I should have recorded that.

240
00:24:01,439 --> 00:24:02,691
I'll see you.

241
00:24:26,006 --> 00:24:27,591
This is an illusion.

242
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,177
The darkness isn't real.

243
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:34,931
It's bright outside.

244
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:38,560
It's all in my head…

245
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,500
Look behind you.

246
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:06,671
You'll find a whole new world.

247
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,479
DONG-SEOK

248
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:09,567
Here's a gift.

249
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,447
Cabbage.

250
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:17,492
Grapes.

251
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:21,413
Yogurt.

252
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:25,375
Rice puffs.

253
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,295
Rice puffs.

254
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:32,007
Corn puffs.

255
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,719
Nostalgic rice crackers.

256
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,180
Nostalgic rice crackers.

257
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,726
Nickel-silver pots.

258
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,521
Stainless steel pots.

259
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:50,734
Stainless steel pots.

260
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:54,696
Frying pans.

261
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:59,826
Pliers, hammers, and screwdrivers.
All kinds of tools.

262
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:04,456
Pliers, hammers, and screwdrivers.
All kinds of tools.

263
00:27:05,874 --> 00:27:08,460
Tops and shorts.

264
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,338
Tops and shorts.

265
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,174
Make way for the ice!

266
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,801
Coming through!

267
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,636
Make way for the ice!

268
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:21,765
Coming through! Make way for the ice!

269
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,602
Coming through.

270
00:27:25,685 --> 00:27:27,437
-Make way.
-Handcart coming through.

271
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,647
Handcart coming through.

272
00:27:29,731 --> 00:27:32,108
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

273
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,610
-Here.
-Just a second.

274
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:37,197
A basketful of chili peppers?
Just a moment.

275
00:27:37,864 --> 00:27:40,825
Why are there so many customers today?

276
00:27:43,745 --> 00:27:45,872
Byeol-i.

277
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,667
Here you go. Thank you. Come again.

278
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:53,088
All right. There you go.

279
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,923
BYEOLIDALI COFFEE MENU

280
00:27:55,006 --> 00:27:55,840
Come.

281
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,342
Come.

282
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:03,348
Here. Thank you. Come again.

283
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,516
Here.

284
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:07,060
You too?

285
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,939
Put them in here.

286
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,066
-Put in some more.
-Some more.

287
00:28:13,733 --> 00:28:14,901
Be more generous.

288
00:28:14,984 --> 00:28:16,111
-Hairtail!
-Should I fillet it?

289
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:17,904
-Mackerel! Tilefish!
-You're getting it cheap.

290
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,532
-Tilefish! John Dory!
-Just deep fry the fish.

291
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:22,325
-Come take a look.
-It'll taste great.

292
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:25,620
You heard Hye-ja, right?
They're kicking Yeong-ok out.

293
00:28:25,703 --> 00:28:28,248
They can't do that.
Yeong-ok is a certified haenyeo.

294
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,460
They're going to ignore her
so she'll quit on her own.

295
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:34,129
The haenyeos came to an agreement.

296
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,840
If she holds out,
there's nothing they can do about it.

297
00:28:37,424 --> 00:28:38,758
They can't force her to quit.

298
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:41,678
Plus, it's just Hye-ja who hates her.

299
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:44,681
Do you know that Yeong-ok is a liar?

300
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,016
No, she's not.

301
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,811
She might already be seeing a guy,
or maybe she has a kid.

302
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,234
I'm just frustrated.

303
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,579
It looks like you've already decided
to trust Yeong-ok no matter what.

304
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,998
Who will you trust? Hye-ja or Dal-i?

305
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:14,544
Why are you bringing Dal-i into this?

306
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:17,005
Gi-jun, do you like Dal-i?

307
00:29:17,839 --> 00:29:19,007
No, I don't.

308
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:22,010
Show some respect. I'm older than you.

309
00:29:22,093 --> 00:29:23,720
Even your brother treats me nicely.

310
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,556
Gi-jun, apologize to her.

311
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,482
I'm sorry.

312
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:37,275
Apology accepted.

313
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:44,032
That was very charismatic.

314
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:45,825
Don't be so harsh on him.

315
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:47,410
You could've been nicer.

316
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:50,663
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

317
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:51,873
Handcart coming through.

318
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,047
You know tomorrow's our trip, right?

319
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,632
I know.

320
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:03,468
Don't tell anyone about it.

321
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:06,471
I was going to tell my brother.

322
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:10,266
Why? We won't be there for long anyway.

323
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,602
That might not be the case.

324
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,939
-Hey, Jeong-jun.
-Yes?

325
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:18,274
Can you take over?
I need to go to the bathroom.

326
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:20,026
-It's urgent.
-All right.

327
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:21,319
What do you mean?

328
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,447
We're not spending the night there.
It's just a day trip.

329
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,865
A day trip it is, then.

330
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:30,161
We have fresh mackerel, hairtail,

331
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:32,121
cuttlefish, and tilefish!

332
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:34,958
Take a look at our hairtail!

333
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,545
What kind of man gives up so easily?

334
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,380
What would you like, ma'am?

335
00:30:40,463 --> 00:30:42,674
-The hairtail is nice and fresh.
-Then hairtail, please.

336
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,843
-Hairtail? How many?
-I'll have three.

337
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,178
Okay. Three hairtails coming right up.

338
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:49,472
Are you going to grill it or braise it?

339
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,432
There's no other way!

340
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,102
Lower your voice, you punk.

341
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:58,565
Last night, Hyeon came
to see Yeong-ju at 2 a.m.

342
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:01,526
That's because Yeong-ju asked him to come.

343
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:03,695
She asks him to help him with her studies

344
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,864
and bring her food
whenever she gets hungry.

345
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:08,032
She uses all sorts of excuses
to call him over.

346
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:10,994
She has a knack for pestering people
just like her father.

347
00:31:11,077 --> 00:31:14,163
Anyway, I can't sleep at night.

348
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:16,875
I even had a nosebleed this morning.
That never happens.

349
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,710
Do you see this?

350
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,880
You're not the only one
who can't sleep. Jeez.

351
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:26,509
So why can't we just let the kids
get a place of their own?

352
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,970
They registered their marriage,
so it's official.

353
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:31,472
Let's just get them
a small place for now--

354
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:33,141
I don't have any money.

355
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:36,769
If you want them to move out,
pay for it with all that money you have.

356
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:39,564
That's for Yeong-ju's college tuition
and living expenses.

357
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:43,067
Hey, why does my Hyeon have
to sacrifice everything?

358
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:45,320
Yeong-ju still goes to school
and is even studying for college.

359
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,615
Meanwhile, Hyeon dropped out of school
and gave up on going to college.

360
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,034
He'll end up
doing manual labor just like me!

361
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:52,493
He didn't give up on college.

362
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:55,371
He's going to take the GED and apply
once the baby is about four years old.

363
00:31:55,455 --> 00:31:59,083
Anyway, I don't have money.
I'm not getting them a place.

364
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:02,378
Just let Hyeon and Yeong-ju
move in together.

365
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,547
Stop yelling in front of the customers.

366
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,093
Why don't you two move in together
and let them live in the other house?

367
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:13,139
If Hyeon lives with Yeong-ju,
then who's going to cook for me?

368
00:32:15,391 --> 00:32:16,517
You little…

369
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,687
It's normally the guy's side
that buys the house.

370
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:23,942
Fine. Then what about the dowry?

371
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:26,027
Can I expect something grand?

372
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:28,363
Will you buy things made out of diamonds?

373
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:30,823
Will you be quiet? Let me eat in peace.

374
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:33,993
Then eat somewhere else!
Just know that I don't have money.

375
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:35,870
Get them a place with your own money.

376
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,789
Whatever! Forget it then!

377
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,250
They may be young,
but they're married now.

378
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:44,045
If they don't live together,
they might grow apart--

379
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,380
And end up like these guys.

380
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:48,424
What?

381
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:50,885
They'll get divorced just like you two.

382
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:53,763
-You damn punk.
-Look who's here.

383
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,057
What are you doing here?
Did you sell all your vegetables?

384
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,810
Business is doing well today.
There's not much left.

385
00:32:58,893 --> 00:32:59,894
That's good to hear.

386
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,604
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

387
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,819
Hey, aren't you going
to say hello to your mother?

388
00:33:07,902 --> 00:33:09,070
Give me some more meat.

389
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:11,531
Jeez.

390
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:12,824
Hey.

391
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:15,952
Everyone knows about you, you know.

392
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:20,832
I heard you're building a house
near the ranch with some woman.

393
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:23,918
I heard she tried to kill herself.

394
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:26,337
Why would you get involved
with a woman like her?

395
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,673
Let me know if you want to date someone.

396
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,466
I'll fix you up with a nice woman.

397
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:34,220
If there's a nice woman,
why don't you date her yourself?

398
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:37,765
You rude little punk…

399
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,646
Hey.

400
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:47,859
Listen, you punk.
I was just looking out for you.

401
00:33:47,942 --> 00:33:51,195
You didn't have to glare at me like that.

402
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,032
-Don't you know how much I care?
-I do know.

403
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,492
But let me eat in peace.

404
00:33:57,076 --> 00:34:01,205
I can't eat properly
with everyone talking to me.

405
00:34:03,666 --> 00:34:05,501
I'm glad you know that I care.

406
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:08,921
Cut the crap.
You're scared of him, aren't you?

407
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:10,923
What…

408
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:12,008
Here you go.

409
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,928
Who is she?

410
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,477
When an elderly person asks a question,
the polite thing to do is answer.

411
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,312
Don't just sit there and stare at me.

412
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:27,106
Who's that woman you're seeing?

413
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:33,571
Hurry up and tell her.
Ms. Hyeon just asked you a question.

414
00:34:34,947 --> 00:34:36,574
If it weren't for Ms. Hyeon,

415
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:39,452
your sister's body
would still be out in the sea.

416
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:44,582
Dong-seok, just answer the question.

417
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,293
I'd like some more soup without the meat.

418
00:34:47,376 --> 00:34:48,544
Okay.

419
00:34:52,715 --> 00:34:54,926
Is she someone you know from the past?

420
00:34:57,470 --> 00:34:59,472
Why aren't you answering me?

421
00:34:59,555 --> 00:35:00,556
Yes.

422
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:02,809
Is she from Jeju?

423
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:04,143
She's from Seoul.

424
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,729
She got a divorce.

425
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,898
She has a five-year-old son,

426
00:35:08,981 --> 00:35:10,733
and he lives with his dad.

427
00:35:10,817 --> 00:35:13,903
I wanted to build a house
and live with her in Jeju,

428
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:16,989
but she wanted to live in Seoul,
so I let her go.

429
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:20,618
Is it completely over?

430
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:25,039
No one knows the future.
If she comes back, maybe we might…

431
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,960
Are you done asking questions?

432
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:31,212
I'd prefer not to talk.

433
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,268
Hey.

434
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,770
-Hey.
-Hey, finish your food!

435
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,817
We can talk about getting a place
for the kids next time.

436
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,320
-Enjoy your meal. I'm off to work.
-All right.

437
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,660
It's nice to know that
he's seeing someone.

438
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:04,370
Right.

439
00:36:04,453 --> 00:36:06,455
There's nothing wrong
with a divorced woman.

440
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,541
Think of Dong-seok's age.

441
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,252
And it's okay that she has a child.

442
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,087
Yes, of course.

443
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:19,051
-All right. Pick whatever you want!
-How much is this?

444
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:21,387
Grab what you want!
Pick whatever you want!

445
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,431
It's a bargain sale!

446
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:32,899
How much does this cost?

447
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,235
BARGAIN SALE

448
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:37,612
I'll take it.

449
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,053
Five thousand won.

450
00:37:02,136 --> 00:37:04,347
Five thousand won.

451
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,806
Five thousand won!

452
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,396
It's 5,000 won for 1 and 10,000 won for 2.

453
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,315
Do you not pay attention to the price?

454
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:24,909
Gosh.

455
00:37:34,543 --> 00:37:37,630
Guys, just go. I'm going to call it a day.

456
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:39,382
I said, leave!

457
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,260
Damn it.

458
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,390
Damn it. She pisses me off so much.

459
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:49,725
Jeez.

460
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:53,771
What was all that?

461
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,483
Why did she have to buy it here?
She never buys from me.

462
00:37:57,566 --> 00:37:59,402
Is she trying to provoke me or what?

463
00:38:00,695 --> 00:38:02,446
I'm done for the day!

464
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:18,963
Keep them all.
Don't ever come near my truck again.

465
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,845
I'm already trying so hard

466
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,681
to suppress my anger.

467
00:38:29,432 --> 00:38:31,183
So don't provoke me, okay?

468
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:34,145
-All right?
-You crazy punk.

469
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:35,730
How dare you raise your voice.

470
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,191
How dare you yell at your own mother
who gave birth to you!

471
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:41,652
Only 2,000 won
for the remaining vegetables.

472
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:42,945
Come on.

473
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,239
-My mother who gave birth to me?
-That's right.

474
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,033
She gave birth to you.

475
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,785
If it weren't for her,
you wouldn't have been born.

476
00:38:49,869 --> 00:38:53,998
Do you think I asked her
to give birth to me?

477
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:55,916
Do you? Damn it!

478
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:59,503
-Watch your damn language.
-Ma'am, just ignore him.

479
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,589
Your mother is going to die soon!

480
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,969
You'll be crying in regret
once your mother's gone, you punk.

481
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,387
You damn punk!

482
00:39:08,471 --> 00:39:12,266
How dare you glare
at your mother like that!

483
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,310
We all die one day!

484
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:17,229
She isn't the only one who's going to die.

485
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,733
I'm going to die one day,
and the same goes for everyone here!

486
00:39:20,816 --> 00:39:21,901
Just leave. Go.

487
00:39:21,984 --> 00:39:25,529
I'll cry in regret after you're dead.

488
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:29,367
But let's not see each other
while we're still alive!

489
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:31,994
-Don't even act like you know me!
-Enough!

490
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,329
-Just go.
-Got it?

491
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:35,539
Get off me, you punk!

492
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,886
Four iced coffee.

493
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:55,351
Here.

494
00:39:57,978 --> 00:39:59,021
Ms. Kang.

495
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:01,023
Are you sick?

496
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,858
No.

497
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:06,695
You're always sick
once you reach this age.

498
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,030
My goodness.

499
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:11,784
That's what you meant?
I thought she was really sick.

500
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:14,120
-Ms. Kang.
-Yes?

501
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:16,163
Drink it down. You'll feel a lot better.

502
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,541
Bottoms up.

503
00:41:39,371 --> 00:41:40,456
Min Seon-a.

504
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:43,959
That's the name

505
00:41:44,752 --> 00:41:47,213
of the lady that you
and the haenyeos saved.

506
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,717
When she was young,
she moved to our neighborhood

507
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,219
and lived there for a bit.

508
00:41:57,223 --> 00:41:58,557
I used to like her.

509
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,729
Apparently, she got divorced
and came back here.

510
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,899
But she went back a few days ago.

511
00:42:08,817 --> 00:42:10,945
You don't need to tell me
If you don't want to.

512
00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:13,155
I want to.

513
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,159
Because it's you.

514
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:21,288
Is this how it feels to like someone?

515
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,707
I constantly want to brag about her.

516
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:26,252
She's pretty, right?

517
00:42:28,003 --> 00:42:29,046
She is.

518
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,221
Maybe I should fix things up
and move in here myself.

519
00:42:39,515 --> 00:42:41,850
If you fix it up, it won't be too bad.

520
00:42:44,812 --> 00:42:45,896
Are you seeing anyone?

521
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:50,568
-Yes.
-Oh, right. Yeong-ok.

522
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:52,861
Did you sleep with her?

523
00:42:54,488 --> 00:42:55,573
Not yet.

524
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:58,659
We have…

525
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,161
an extremely emotional bond.

526
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:09,545
Yeong-ok seems like a nice girl.

527
00:43:11,714 --> 00:43:14,758
She seems tough like a Jeju woman.

528
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:16,635
She's bright too.

529
00:43:18,512 --> 00:43:20,598
You're a good guy, and she's a good girl.

530
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,523
I'm a bad guy.

531
00:43:30,482 --> 00:43:32,109
Can bad guys meet good girls?

532
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:33,611
No.

533
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,406
If you want to meet a nice girl,
you need to be nice too.

534
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:39,700
You've got a long way to go.

535
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:43,162
Look at you making jokes.

536
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:44,496
Do you have a death wish?

537
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,343
I guess bad guys can also turn good.

538
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,138
You must really like her.

539
00:44:02,973 --> 00:44:06,060
I want to live with her
and have a normal life.

540
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:12,650
I miss her.

541
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,861
Is she coming back?

542
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:19,823
She never mentioned that,
but I'm willing to wait.

543
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,620
I'll just keep living my life like this
and see how things turn out.

544
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,708
But just the thought of waiting for her

545
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:33,545
makes me feel warm and tingly
for some reason.

546
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,466
It feels kind of nice. It's not bad.

547
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:38,717
It's strange.

548
00:44:40,469 --> 00:44:41,970
Dong-seok,

549
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,015
that is what you call love.

550
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:48,435
And you know love?

551
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,603
I do.

552
00:44:51,063 --> 00:44:52,398
So you know a thing or two?

553
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:54,400
-Hey.
-Are you an expert on love?

554
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:57,903
Get back to work, you punk.

555
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:02,658
Hey, Dong-seok.

556
00:45:18,465 --> 00:45:22,636
You'd better get your act straight
if you want to keep harvesting here.

557
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,640
The other haenyeos and I

558
00:45:26,723 --> 00:45:29,476
have already agreed to kick Yeong-ok out.

559
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,812
That's enough.

560
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:33,605
What are you talking about?

561
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,732
Haenyeos should act as one.

562
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:39,445
Yeong-ok only cares about herself.
She doesn't give a hoot about us.

563
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:40,487
My point exactly.

564
00:45:41,155 --> 00:45:42,072
Ms. Hyeon.

565
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:43,907
Starting from today,

566
00:45:43,991 --> 00:45:46,785
none of us are going to swim
near Yeong-ok.

567
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:51,373
Up until now, you always kept her safe
by keeping an eye on her,

568
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:54,126
and that allowed her to have it easy.

569
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:57,171
But you need to be straight with her now.

570
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,590
Don't swim near her.

571
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:01,800
Otherwise, we're going to go on a strike.

572
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,302
Only two ladies objected.

573
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,971
Everyone else has agreed to do as I say.

574
00:46:06,763 --> 00:46:08,974
-Ms. Hyeon.
-What are you calling her for?

575
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:11,185
Hye-ja, that's enough.

576
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:13,854
Stop yelling in front of Ms. Hyeon.

577
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:18,066
Dal-i, you're more than free
to take Yeong-ok's side if you want to.

578
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,693
Ms. Hyeon…

579
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:24,615
She'll get herself killed if she continues
to harvest the way she does.

580
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,117
As for you ladies, do what Hye-ja says.

581
00:46:27,201 --> 00:46:32,706
From now on, I don't want anyone talking
to Yeong-ok or even going near her.

582
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:33,957
Eventually,

583
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:38,170
I'm sure she'll get tired of it
and quit on her own.

584
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:40,797
-You heard her, right?
-Yes.

585
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,508
Sorry I'm late.

586
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:45,511
Ms. Hyeon, did you sleep well?

587
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:54,061
What's going on?

588
00:46:54,686 --> 00:46:56,271
Something feels a little off.

589
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,106
The haenyeos are going to ignore you.

590
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:01,401
Sadly, Ms. Hyeon doesn't
have your back either.

591
00:47:02,819 --> 00:47:05,614
I'm fine as long as I have you.
I know you won't ignore me.

592
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,282
You're way too optimistic.

593
00:47:07,366 --> 00:47:10,244
Let's go. And stop being so late.

594
00:47:13,664 --> 00:47:16,500
Gosh, it's so hard to make money.

595
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,427
JEONJIN 1

596
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,652
Let's go to Jeju City after harvesting.

597
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:45,070
I found a nice coffee shop.

598
00:47:45,153 --> 00:47:46,196
With Byeol-i?

599
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:48,156
No, just you.

600
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,700
Are you nuts?

601
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,424
Captain.

602
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,361
Yeong-ok's phone is ringing again.

603
00:49:07,986 --> 00:49:10,614
It always rings at this hour.

604
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:13,200
Don't you find that weird?

605
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:08,338
Are you nuts? You'll die like that!

606
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,257
Ms. Hyeon and I keep telling you.

607
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:11,883
Harvest one abalone at a time.

608
00:50:11,967 --> 00:50:13,593
"Harvest one abalone at a time."

609
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,762
"If you try to get more, you could die."

610
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:16,847
"Are you crazy?"

611
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,765
If you know that, stop being so greedy.

612
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,392
You'll really get yourself killed.

613
00:50:20,475 --> 00:50:22,728
Abalones aren't more important
than your life.

614
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:24,563
This better be the last time.

615
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:27,566
Or I'll take Hye-ja's side
and have you quit harvesting.

616
00:50:37,617 --> 00:50:39,619
TRAVEL TO MARA ISLAND
AND GAPA ISLAND FROM UNJIN PORT

617
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:43,331
BOARDING PLATFORM FOR GAPA ISLAND

618
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,719
Seven.

619
00:51:39,679 --> 00:51:40,680
Five.

620
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,850
Twenty laps for you and ten for me.

621
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:45,769
It was ten for you and fifteen for me.

622
00:51:45,852 --> 00:51:47,270
When did we agree on that?

623
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,648
I'll do 10 laps and you do 16 laps.

624
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,857
What do you mean?

625
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,526
I thought it was 10 for you and 15 for me.

626
00:51:52,609 --> 00:51:54,152
Okay, fine.

627
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,905
I'll do 10 laps and you do 17 laps. Deal?

628
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,782
I'm done.

629
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,283
Come on.

630
00:52:02,994 --> 00:52:04,371
Are you sulking?

631
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,455
Okay, fine.

632
00:52:05,539 --> 00:52:07,207
You do 15 laps. I'll do 10.

633
00:52:07,290 --> 00:52:08,792
I'll cut you some slack.

634
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,255
No!

635
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:29,938
Hey.

636
00:52:30,605 --> 00:52:32,482
You're not even done with yours.

637
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,570
Eat your own.

638
00:52:37,737 --> 00:52:39,322
Okay, fine. Have this.

639
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:51,918
What? What's the matter?

640
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,508
Give it to me.

641
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,053
Don't let go.

642
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,026
Cheers.

643
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:35,462
Can't you quit being a haenyeo?

644
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,467
Why? Because Hye-ja doesn't like me?

645
00:53:42,218 --> 00:53:43,303
Yes.

646
00:53:44,512 --> 00:53:45,680
I can't quit.

647
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:51,269
I love Jeju Island,
the sea, and harvesting.

648
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,940
Why do you like the sea so much?

649
00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,902
When I'm underwater,

650
00:53:59,778 --> 00:54:03,698
it makes me think I'm all alone.
That's what I love about it.

651
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,534
There's nothing in my way.

652
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,913
It's just me and the sea.

653
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:11,957
Me and the abalones.

654
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,417
Me and the seaweeds.

655
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:17,879
I like the simplicity of it.

656
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:20,548
Then try not to be so greedy underwater.

657
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:24,803
No.

658
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:27,180
I need to make a lot of money.

659
00:54:29,015 --> 00:54:30,767
I can lend you money.

660
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,854
Captain.

661
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,274
A couple should never
lend money to each other.

662
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:40,777
Let me give you a word of advice.

663
00:54:41,486 --> 00:54:44,823
If a girl whom you've known
for less than a year asks you for money,

664
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:47,033
break things off right away.

665
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,077
End it with her then and there.

666
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:52,789
For your information,
if you ask me for money,

667
00:54:53,498 --> 00:54:56,459
I'll end things with you
right here, right now.

668
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,211
It'll be quick and easy.

669
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,598
But there's something I don't understand
about the haenyeos.

670
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,978
They always tell me
not to be greedy when we're out at sea,

671
00:55:15,061 --> 00:55:18,815
but they secretly share
all the good places for abalones.

672
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,150
They never tell me.

673
00:55:20,817 --> 00:55:22,694
What's that about? It's annoying.

674
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,865
They always say
haenyeos need to act as one,

675
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:30,201
but they leave me out and are mean to me
because I'm from the mainland.

676
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:42,547
If you want to keep being a haenyeo,
then promise me one thing.

677
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,386
Don't ever swim alone
when you're out in the sea.

678
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:52,599
Always stay close to Ms. Hyeon
and the other haenyeos.

679
00:56:00,690 --> 00:56:02,192
I prefer being alone.

680
00:56:03,234 --> 00:56:04,152
No.

681
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:07,864
When you're at sea,

682
00:56:07,947 --> 00:56:10,408
you have to listen to Ms. Hyeon
and the other haenyeos.

683
00:56:11,785 --> 00:56:13,495
Once you're underwater,

684
00:56:13,578 --> 00:56:16,998
there's nothing I can do to save you
no matter how much I love you.

685
00:56:17,665 --> 00:56:19,667
Only Ms. Hyeon
and the haenyeos can help you.

686
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:24,255
So I want you to promise me that.

687
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,304
Why aren't you answering?

688
00:56:33,306 --> 00:56:34,432
You…

689
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,146
just said that you loved me.

690
00:56:42,065 --> 00:56:44,025
You accidentally confessed your feelings.

691
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,027
Didn't you?

692
00:56:48,321 --> 00:56:49,781
Do you want to take it back?

693
00:56:49,864 --> 00:56:51,282
Do you want me to forget?

694
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,410
No, I was going to say it anyway.

695
00:57:00,041 --> 00:57:01,709
-We need to catch the ferry.
-Right…

696
00:57:02,293 --> 00:57:03,169
Should we run?

697
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,925
Well, we don't have to.

698
00:57:11,469 --> 00:57:12,512
Should we run?

699
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,224
Well, we don't have to.

700
00:57:28,486 --> 00:57:29,696
INCOMING CALL

701
00:57:33,491 --> 00:57:34,659
Why didn't you pick up?

702
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,786
I didn't want to be disturbed.

703
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:40,206
Gosh, it's getting a little chilly.

704
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:48,256
This is nice.

705
00:59:13,091 --> 00:59:14,592
Captain, go ahead and wash.

706
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,054
Okay.

707
01:00:21,743 --> 01:00:23,453
Then it's a deal, okay?

708
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:26,873
Nothing's going to happen tonight.
We're just going to drink.

709
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,379
-Deal.
-Because if we get drunk and do it…

710
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:36,382
Then our love will get tainted

711
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,384
by alcohol.

712
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:39,594
That's right.

713
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:43,806
I don't want to wake up the next morning
with no memories of the night before

714
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,933
or of the things you said.

715
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:48,061
That would just be terrible.

716
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:49,228
Exactly.

717
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:51,731
Let's just drink tonight.

718
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,650
-We click so well.
-A match made in heaven.

719
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,659
By the way, you seemed sober
when you went in to take a shower.

720
01:01:02,742 --> 01:01:04,243
But why did you come out tipsy?

721
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,331
I'm only tipsy because I drank alone
while you were taking a shower.

722
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:13,586
While you were in the shower,
I drank because I felt awkward.

723
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:16,339
But I started getting tipsy
while I was taking a shower.

724
01:01:16,422 --> 01:01:19,300
I slapped myself so I'd sober up.
I even took a cold shower.

725
01:01:19,384 --> 01:01:21,177
But nothing really helped.

726
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:25,640
-Is this funny?
-Yes.

727
01:01:26,265 --> 01:01:27,350
I find it sad.

728
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,487
Do you have any requirements for me?

729
01:01:41,406 --> 01:01:44,701
Keep treating me with respect
even though we're going out.

730
01:01:44,784 --> 01:01:46,327
Let's not disrespect each other.

731
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,204
What else?

732
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:51,249
Don't do the things I don't like
instead of trying to be too nice.

733
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,668
Also,

734
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:57,839
try to stay pure and naive
just like you are now.

735
01:01:58,423 --> 01:01:59,799
Don't meet another man.

736
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:03,386
Don't smoke. It's bad for your health.

737
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:06,431
-I don't smoke.
-I only want you to drink with me.

738
01:02:06,514 --> 01:02:07,932
-Same goes for you.
-Of course.

739
01:02:08,015 --> 01:02:09,350
Oh, and most importantly,

740
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:11,644
let's not be serious.

741
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,020
Let's always stay bright

742
01:02:13,771 --> 01:02:15,523
and have fun when we're together.

743
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:17,400
Sounds good to me.

744
01:02:31,205 --> 01:02:34,792
By the way, why don't you ever
talk about your parents?

745
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,629
Oh, my parents?

746
01:02:39,297 --> 01:02:40,339
Yes.

747
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,428
My parents

748
01:02:46,637 --> 01:02:48,139
were both painters.

749
01:02:49,474 --> 01:02:52,101
Well, at least that's what they told me.

750
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:57,023
I never saw any of their paintings.
I found out after I grew up.

751
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:05,573
They thought if they kept their paintings,
it might make them want to paint again.

752
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,242
So as soon as

753
01:03:09,535 --> 01:03:11,662
Disaster and I were born,

754
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:14,707
they started a fire in the yard

755
01:03:16,042 --> 01:03:20,171
and burned every single painting they had.

756
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:25,718
"Disaster"?

757
01:03:27,303 --> 01:03:28,805
I need to go to the bathroom.

758
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,569
INCOMING CALL

759
01:04:43,754 --> 01:04:44,922
Hello?

760
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,176
Oh, well…

761
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:53,139
Yeong-ok isn't here right now.

762
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,934
May I ask who's calling?

763
01:05:31,844 --> 01:05:33,846
I'm packing up for tomorrow's flight.

764
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:34,764
My best friend.

765
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,266
Judging by that photo,
it's hard to believe you're friends.

766
01:05:37,350 --> 01:05:40,144
Ko Mi-ran has returned to Pureung
after three years.

767
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:41,687
Mi-ran!

768
01:05:41,771 --> 01:05:43,731
Mi-ran is a princess, and you're her maid.

769
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:45,024
Just shut it.

770
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,901
Eun-hui and I are one.

771
01:05:46,984 --> 01:05:48,486
-Loyalty!
-Loyalty!

772
01:05:49,195 --> 01:05:50,988
She had to hold her breath for so long.

773
01:05:51,072 --> 01:05:54,367
You could've gotten her killed.
What would you have done then?

774
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,037
How can you be so forgiving?

775
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:00,957
Did you forget what happened that day?

776
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,502
I'm so happy that I have you.

777
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:10,800
