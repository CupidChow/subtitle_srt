1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,112
IN-GWON AND HO-SIK

2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,700
A GAMBLER AND A THUG,
UPSTAIRS AND DOWNSTAIRS NEIGHBORS

3
00:01:02,854 --> 00:01:03,897
Step outside.

4
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,858
You damn bastard.

5
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:09,569
What's going on between you two?

6
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,044
There. I stepped outside.

7
00:01:28,379 --> 00:01:30,089
What now, you bastard?

8
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,176
-Oh, my gosh!
-You bastard!

9
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,846
-Stop it!
-You asshole! Come here, you bastard!

10
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,015
You scum!

11
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,142
Damn you!

12
00:01:41,726 --> 00:01:43,228
Come here!

13
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:47,190
-Oh, gosh!
-My goodness!

14
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,817
Hey.

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,778
-You bastard.
-Someone, stop him!

16
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:53,279
-Stop it.
-Damn it.

17
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:55,240
-Come here!
-Gosh!

18
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:57,450
-Oh, no!
-Oh, dear!

19
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,661
You bastard!

20
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,329
-Stop it!
-Hey! Let go!

21
00:02:01,412 --> 00:02:02,539
Let me go!

22
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,458
-Hey!
-My gosh!

23
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:07,877
Hey!

24
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,047
That damn lunatic.

25
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:16,427
You little…

26
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,266
Hey, what's all that ruckus about?

27
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,476
Damn it.

28
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,646
Be careful, Captain!

29
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:31,359
Why is it so noisy?

30
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:34,320
Thankfully, Jeong-jun is on his way.

31
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,866
Move aside! Move!

32
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,659
-You asshole.
-Calm down!

33
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,452
-Hey.
-Are you okay?

34
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,955
-I'll kill you! Let me go!
-Calm down.

35
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:46,583
I'll kill him and go to jail if I have to.

36
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,710
Hey! Your daughter was the one

37
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:50,795
who slept with my son and ruined his life.

38
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,132
Was it wrong of me to want
an abortion for both of their sakes?

39
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:56,217
-You--
-Then will you have the baby?

40
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:57,510
That's enough.

41
00:02:58,177 --> 00:02:59,971
Look at you, all beaten up.

42
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,264
Get up.

43
00:03:01,347 --> 00:03:03,516
Is that all you've got, you thug?

44
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,852
I'm a sundae vendor, not a thug!

45
00:03:05,935 --> 00:03:07,979
You failed to raise your son properly.

46
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,607
I raised Yeong-ju so well!

47
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,525
I was very proud of her!

48
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,319
My girl…

49
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:18,865
Her life is ruined
thanks to your son, you thug!

50
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:20,533
Stop calling me a thug!

51
00:03:20,617 --> 00:03:21,951
-I'll kill you!
-Goodness!

52
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,080
How dare you wield a knife at me?
Fine. Stab me.

53
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,166
Stab me, you bastard!

54
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,877
Do you even know how to stab someone?

55
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,086
No, I don't!

56
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:34,631
What did you say?
Take her to a good hospital?

57
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,633
How could you say that?

58
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:41,512
Do you think I need your money
to take her to a hospital, you asshole?

59
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:45,475
If you're a true father and a man,

60
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:49,312
you must do whatever it takes
and take responsibility.

61
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:52,106
She better gets that abortion. Got that?

62
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,068
-If not, I'll make her--
-That's enough!

63
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,402
You too!

64
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,238
They're all listening!

65
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,406
I don't give a damn!

66
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:06,287
My life is in the gutter anyway!

67
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,290
Hey, that's enough. Leave!

68
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,000
Stop causing a scene and leave!

69
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:14,420
-You better not touch Yeong-ju!
-Go.

70
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,256
Or I'll kill you!

71
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,175
-Go!
-What's this about?

72
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:21,052
Yeong-ju is pregnant?

73
00:04:21,135 --> 00:04:22,971
And Hyeon is the father?

74
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:26,307
Why have those two fallen apart?

75
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,684
They used to be so close.

76
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,353
Goodness, I can't believe this.

77
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,438
He got beaten to a pulp.

78
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:36,359
Let go of me.

79
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:43,199
I'll drop you off. Let's go to my car.

80
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:44,909
I'm fine.

81
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:52,333
Just close my store for the day
and apologize to the old ladies for me.

82
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:01,884
Let's grab a drink next time.

83
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:05,596
You know I understand you, right?

84
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,954
IN-GWON AND HO-SIK 2

85
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,519
-Delivery.
-Coming.

86
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,320
MINJEONG TAILOR SHOP
JJAJANG 1, JJAMPPONG 1

87
00:06:12,246 --> 00:06:13,956
What are you doing in the dark?

88
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:24,008
What happened to your face?

89
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:26,844
Nothing much.

90
00:06:27,970 --> 00:06:29,597
I tripped while drunk.

91
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:34,811
Sit down.

92
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,158
JOEUN BANK
SINYANG BANK

93
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,536
One is a savings account

94
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,958
that I made for your tuition and rent

95
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:59,585
once you go to Seoul.

96
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:03,172
You can withdraw 70 million won at once.

97
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,218
The other one

98
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,096
is for buying a fishing boat

99
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:13,057
once you go to Seoul

100
00:07:13,850 --> 00:07:15,810
and I quit work.

101
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:19,397
It's worth 70 million won,

102
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,108
but there's only half right now.

103
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:32,869
SAVINGS ACCOUNT
BANG YEONG-JU

104
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,753
I had saved up

105
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:46,340
every little penny for that.

106
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:53,598
By next month, I'll pay back
all of Eun-hui's money.

107
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:57,518
This house

108
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:00,229
and all that money

109
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,565
are yours.

110
00:08:08,738 --> 00:08:10,114
And?

111
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,074
Get an abortion.

112
00:08:12,783 --> 00:08:15,536
Then go live in Seoul.

113
00:08:22,084 --> 00:08:24,212
You just don't know.

114
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,882
But you'll be just fine
after the abortion.

115
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:32,929
And I'll be fine with the baby too.

116
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,058
If you don't have the baby,

117
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,395
you'd be able to become
a professor, a hospital director,

118
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:43,523
or anything else
you've dreamed of. So why?

119
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:46,943
-Why do you want to settle here?
-I don't.

120
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,778
I'm still going
to Seoul National University.

121
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:50,446
Raising a baby is no joke!

122
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:54,700
I suffered one too many headaches
while raising you

123
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:58,079
and have shed enough tears
to fill up that sea.

124
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,206
I won't talk anymore.

125
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,543
Get rid of that baggage.

126
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,465
What did you say?

127
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:13,928
"Baggage"?

128
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,347
Yes.

129
00:09:17,265 --> 00:09:19,058
Baggage.

130
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,145
If my baby is baggage…

131
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:28,359
then I must be one

132
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:31,445
to you as well.

133
00:09:35,157 --> 00:09:36,450
Of course.

134
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,829
I suffered every day while raising you.

135
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:43,708
So I can't make you do the same.

136
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,004
I'm being like this

137
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:50,548
-all because of--
-Because of me?

138
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,216
You're wrong.

139
00:09:54,093 --> 00:09:55,886
This is all for your sake.

140
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,139
Had I not existed…

141
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,267
Had this baggage not existed,

142
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:07,732
you'd be enjoying the rest of your life,
fishing on your boat.

143
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,484
Right?

144
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,529
Yes.

145
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:15,323
So?

146
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,576
Do I not deserve that kind of a lifestyle?

147
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:22,538
Must you suck me dry

148
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:27,501
until the very end to be satisfied?

149
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:30,755
I don't want to hear it.

150
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:32,757
Make your decision.

151
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:35,426
Is it me or that baggage?

152
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:36,802
If it's the latter,

153
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,348
get out because I don't want
to see you anymore.

154
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,814
Fine.

155
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:54,820
I'll leave.

156
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:55,089
Fine, just leave. Get out!

157
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:59,802
But if you go through that door,

158
00:12:00,594 --> 00:12:02,513
I will cut ties with you for good.

159
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:04,557
Understand?

160
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,688
You must be happy

161
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,607
since your baggage chose to leave.

162
00:12:15,609 --> 00:12:16,610
Goodbye.

163
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:15,753
Are you alive?

164
00:13:15,836 --> 00:13:16,879
DONG-SEOK

165
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:18,172
Yes.

166
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,760
All right, then.

167
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:36,273
Hey, how could you pack
and leave just because you fought

168
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,858
with your dad?

169
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,280
-He didn't stop me.
-Jeez.

170
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,909
It's late, so spend the night here
and leave tomorrow.

171
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,454
I'll get in trouble if they know
that a minor stayed here.

172
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,622
Gosh.

173
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:54,375
Hyeon?

174
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,335
-Why are you here?
-Hello.

175
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,630
Can I see Yeong-ju for just ten minutes?

176
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:01,632
Look at you two.

177
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,969
Just ten minutes.

178
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,012
-Okay.
-Go in.

179
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:25,990
Which one do you want?

180
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,202
The fruit.

181
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,431
Keep this. It's the money I earned today.

182
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,446
I'll spend it wisely.

183
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,495
Are you sick?

184
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,789
You're sweating.

185
00:15:17,708 --> 00:15:18,792
I have a cold.

186
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,963
It says online not to take medication
during pregnancy.

187
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:30,262
I'm sure there must be medicine
that pregnant women can have.

188
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:43,525
What's wrong?

189
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:45,778
You do know

190
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:48,656
that we're disappointing our dads

191
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,618
and hurting them a lot, don't you?

192
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,338
That's why from now on,

193
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:07,591
we should…

194
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:12,012
love,

195
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,307
trust,

196
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,103
and treat each other better.

197
00:16:19,186 --> 00:16:20,646
We must be happy.

198
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,149
But Yeong-ju.

199
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:26,694
You should go back home.

200
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:31,198
I don't think you should be here.

201
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:34,660
If the owner here calls my dad,

202
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,997
I know he'll come and pick me up
no matter what time. I know him.

203
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:42,793
He was too furious
to stop me from leaving.

204
00:16:44,086 --> 00:16:45,421
But he'll ultimately give in.

205
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,425
He'll get mad
if he sees you here, so you should go.

206
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:53,679
-I'll take you back home.
-That'll mean I gave up.

207
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:56,682
Then I'll have to get an abortion.

208
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,019
I'm going to wait here until he comes.

209
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,649
I'm going to study, so go.

210
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,752
Do you have

211
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:27,254
a death wish or something?

212
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,383
You can hit me.

213
00:17:32,301 --> 00:17:34,303
But please bring Yeong-ju back home, sir.

214
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:36,638
I mean…

215
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:39,183
-Father.
-You little…

216
00:17:42,019 --> 00:17:43,353
My feelings are sincere.

217
00:17:44,271 --> 00:17:45,939
I truly care for her and love her.

218
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,859
If you really loved and cared for her,

219
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:50,944
how could you make her pregnant?

220
00:17:51,028 --> 00:17:54,615
You scumbag! You bastard!

221
00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:55,699
I'm sorry.

222
00:17:57,701 --> 00:17:59,995
Yeong-ju is currently at Badang Motel.

223
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,164
But she has a cold.

224
00:18:03,123 --> 00:18:05,167
Sir. Mr. Bang.

225
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,002
Father.

226
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,214
-Please bring her home--
-I wondered what this noise was.

227
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:12,257
But it was you attacking my son.

228
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,016
Let go of him.

229
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,144
He's my son.

230
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,647
If anyone should beat him, it's me.

231
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:31,151
Let him go if you want to stay alive.

232
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:37,616
You…

233
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,409
You better tell her.

234
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,371
Tell her she won't get her way this time.

235
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:46,083
Tell her I won't give in this time around.

236
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:51,046
You son of a gun.

237
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,364
Kneel.

238
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,256
Your school and academy called.

239
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:38,302
They said you didn't show up today.

240
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:42,306
-So why are you home so late?
-I went to work.

241
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:46,268
Don't pick up when the school calls.

242
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:49,730
They'll automatically drop me out.

243
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,024
And the academy fee?

244
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,860
Did you give it to Yeong-ju?

245
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:56,195
I spent it myself.

246
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,743
Jeez.

247
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,079
Damn it.

248
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,041
You abandoned your duties as a student.

249
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,336
And you stole my money.

250
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:15,422
Hey.

251
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,424
Hey.

252
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,930
Don't trust women. Okay?

253
00:20:24,806 --> 00:20:26,642
Take your mom for example.

254
00:20:28,185 --> 00:20:30,646
In the end, she abandoned you.

255
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,856
It was for her own sake, you bastard.

256
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,775
Get your facts straight.

257
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,530
Mom never abandoned me.

258
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,203
-She abandoned you.
-How dare you?

259
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,338
-What did you say?
-She never abandoned me.

260
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,467
I let her go.

261
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:09,518
What a load of bullshit.

262
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:10,644
Hey!

263
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,730
Be a man and acknowledge the truth!

264
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:18,735
Both you and I
were abandoned by her! Got that?

265
00:21:19,444 --> 00:21:23,240
Don't trust women!
Yeong-ju will ultimately abandon you too.

266
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,325
You're a high school dropout.

267
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:28,120
Why would she live with a guy like you?

268
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,873
She may be
head over heels for you right now.

269
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:36,336
But she will abandon you
in the end, you scumbag.

270
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,630
You better go to school tomorrow.

271
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:43,010
If not, I will seriously kill you.

272
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,765
Hello, Ok-dong.

273
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,561
Goodness.

274
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,748
-Where is he going?
-Him?

275
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,292
-He's going to the toilet.
-I see.

276
00:22:16,418 --> 00:22:20,297
Why are you here?
We're going to the tangerine storehouse.

277
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,132
Shouldn't you go to school?

278
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,343
He dropped out.

279
00:22:24,426 --> 00:22:28,221
That man posted about this part-time job.

280
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,766
And he signed up.

281
00:22:31,725 --> 00:22:34,853
Hyeon is going to work
and treat Yeong-ju to some good food.

282
00:22:34,936 --> 00:22:37,689
Goodness. This won't be enough.

283
00:22:38,273 --> 00:22:41,610
Hyeon, did you really sleep with her?

284
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm surprised
you even knew what that meant.

285
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:50,160
Goodness. Both of your parents
must be devastated.

286
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:51,453
That's enough.

287
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:55,082
Don't meddle in other people's affairs.

288
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:03,965
What about Yeong-ju?
Did she drop out of school too?

289
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:06,551
No.

290
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:11,139
Going to school
while pregnant won't be easy.

291
00:23:15,393 --> 00:23:17,979
Have a bowl of soup.

292
00:23:24,569 --> 00:23:25,612
What is it?

293
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,072
Hey, In-gwon.

294
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,574
I called to tell you something.

295
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,202
Ho-sik's daughter, Yeong-ju,

296
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:34,329
has been staying
at our motel since yesterday.

297
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:37,124
She's refusing to go home.

298
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,210
And Ho-sik isn't picking up
or replying to my texts either.

299
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:43,922
So I called you out of frustration.

300
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:45,423
Can you--

301
00:23:45,507 --> 00:23:47,717
Did Hyeon go there too?

302
00:23:47,801 --> 00:23:48,885
What?

303
00:23:50,137 --> 00:23:51,763
Well, for just a while.

304
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,306
For about ten minutes.

305
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,183
Damn it.

306
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,395
You're acting out, aren't you?

307
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:02,315
Then I'll do the same.

308
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,528
-Can we get some ice too?
-Sure.

309
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,322
-Me too.
-Okay.

310
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,704
Mr. Oh's ice has melted.

311
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,915
Mr. Bang's ice is the best.

312
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,250
BANG HO-SIK

313
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:23,795
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

314
00:24:23,879 --> 00:24:25,380
Darn it.

315
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,967
He should still work

316
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:31,386
even if he's upset.
Does he want to starve…

317
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,930
Hey.

318
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,642
I get that you were furious,
but how could you beat him up?

319
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,190
Never mind. Get back to work.

320
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,669
Pick up your phone.

321
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,591
I get that you're upset about Yeong-ju,
but you should still accept orders.

322
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,061
Did she go to school?

323
00:25:22,979 --> 00:25:24,356
She left the house.

324
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:32,948
I understand that you're upset,
but you should just give in.

325
00:25:34,074 --> 00:25:35,367
Never mind.

326
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:45,126
Everyone's talking
about Yeong-ju, aren't they?

327
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,754
They're having a blast.

328
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,384
I was ridiculed

329
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:55,470
for bringing Yeong-ju to work as a baby.

330
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,182
Now, she'll be ridiculed instead.

331
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,520
You should still go look for her.

332
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,729
What for?

333
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:09,526
Give her a week, and she'll know
how tough it is to live in this world.

334
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:13,280
She'll come home on her own.

335
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,492
I will never give in this time around.

336
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:21,913
I'd agree with you
had she not been pregnant.

337
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:24,165
But what can you do now that she is?

338
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:26,334
Never mind.

339
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,803
Never mind.

340
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,014
Never mind.

341
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:42,100
Never mind…

342
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:48,106
Hey, but you shouldn't neglect
your work as an ice seller.

343
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,070
I'll leave you to it

344
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:56,156
if suffering helps you find an answer.

345
00:27:11,755 --> 00:27:15,216
Hyeon, the cold got worse.

346
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,012
I went to school,

347
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,639
but I'm skipping the academy
and going back to the motel.

348
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,605
-That's good.
-Take a look at this.

349
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,942
-Oh, dear!
-Goodness.

350
00:27:33,026 --> 00:27:34,652
-What?
-What's going on?

351
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:36,905
Goodness, are you hurt?

352
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:39,240
Look at this mess.

353
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:41,743
Look at him.

354
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:57,092
HYEON, THE COLD GOT WORSE

355
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:00,970
Yeong-ju.

356
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,723
Go to the hospital if you're that sick.

357
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:26,079
It's not that bad.

358
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,457
Maybe it's because I'm not feeling well,

359
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,001
but I miss you.

360
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,003
Come see me after your part-time job.

361
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,174
Yeong-ju, I'm worried about you.

362
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:42,637
Just go home. Okay? Or go to the hospital.

363
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,389
What if it's not a cold?

364
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,143
I know. This is just a cold.

365
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,855
If that's all you're going to say,
I'm going to stop texting you.

366
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:56,568
Okay. I'm almost done. I'll be there soon.

367
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:28,099
Do you need help?

368
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,938
No.

369
00:29:50,872 --> 00:29:51,748
Let's go.

370
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,171
I'm okay. I can carry it.

371
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:11,559
Are you

372
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:13,978
pregnant?

373
00:30:23,988 --> 00:30:25,949
Can I touch your belly?

374
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:33,414
I'm sorry.

375
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:38,127
You can touch it.

376
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,529
Congratulations.

377
00:31:24,173 --> 00:31:25,383
My baby.

378
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:31,347
I'm happy…

379
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,642
that you're mine.

380
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,487
Hyeon, is that money for Yeong-ju?

381
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:47,488
-Is it?
-Really?

382
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:51,159
What's so funny? Men his age
became dads back in the day.

383
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,620
-Good work.
-Thank you.

384
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,331
Hyeon, get in.

385
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,166
I'm not going home.

386
00:32:25,985 --> 00:32:27,862
-Bang Family Ice.
-Mr. Bang.

387
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,239
Yeong-ju is sick.

388
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:33,034
But she won't go
to the hospital. Please help.

389
00:32:33,117 --> 00:32:34,619
She won't listen to me.

390
00:32:38,247 --> 00:32:40,291
BADANG MOTEL

391
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,924
RECEPTION

392
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,175
Goodness.

393
00:32:49,258 --> 00:32:51,469
-Why are you here?
-Where's Yeong-ju?

394
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,930
It's Room 301.

395
00:32:56,307 --> 00:32:57,600
In-gwon.

396
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:19,455
Is that you, Hyeon?

397
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:28,506
Come out.

398
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,141
Yeong-ju.

399
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:42,186
I'm going to save you and Hyeon
from ruining your lives.

400
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,230
Let's go to the hospital.

401
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:46,482
No, please don't do this.

402
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:47,942
You'll only hurt yourself.

403
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:50,278
I'm heartbroken too, but this isn't right.

404
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,699
Both you and Hyeon have
bright futures ahead of you. Follow me.

405
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:56,159
Mr. Jung.

406
00:33:56,242 --> 00:33:58,286
I'm not soft like your father.

407
00:33:58,369 --> 00:33:59,537
-Mr. Jung!
-Follow me.

408
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,872
-Mr. Jung.
-Come on.

409
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:07,211
Mr. Jung…

410
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:13,092
-You're scaring me.
-Come on!

411
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:15,928
Please don't do this!
I can't go to the hospital!

412
00:34:17,346 --> 00:34:19,140
Just follow me.

413
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,280
Let her go.

414
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,491
Move, you bastard.

415
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,452
Don't be so ignorant.

416
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,121
Just let her go!

417
00:34:43,664 --> 00:34:44,791
"Ignorant"?

418
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,840
Fine.

419
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,052
Your father is an ignorant thug.

420
00:34:56,844 --> 00:34:58,137
So?

421
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,680
What will you do about it?

422
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,433
Will you have the baby and ruin your life?

423
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:04,060
What are you looking at?

424
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:10,733
Get lost, you bastard. Don't embarrass me.

425
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:12,652
Hyeon.

426
00:35:13,152 --> 00:35:14,362
Hyeon.

427
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:15,446
Hyeon…

428
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,962
Let go of her.

429
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,589
I said, let go!

430
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:52,525
You go ahead.

431
00:36:02,743 --> 00:36:04,287
Do I embarrass you?

432
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:06,956
You've always been…

433
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,170
an embarrassment…

434
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:16,215
to me.

435
00:36:18,134 --> 00:36:19,302
What?

436
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,555
I should have left with Mom.

437
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,516
I pitied you, so I didn't.

438
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:29,270
I won't be your son anymore.

439
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,316
I can't do it anymore!

440
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:36,944
You bastard.

441
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,530
Come here!

442
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:41,365
Come here, you little brat!

443
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,785
Bring Yeong-ju here!

444
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,705
I'm taking her to the hospital!

445
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,248
You bastard!

446
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:55,546
What did you do to my daughter?

447
00:36:56,422 --> 00:36:59,425
Why do you care?
I told her to get an abortion.

448
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:01,552
You bastard!

449
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,278
You bastard! How dare you?

450
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:22,114
You asshole!

451
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:46,472
Unbelievable.

452
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,141
Why are you embarrassing yourselves?

453
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,602
You're grown-ups.

454
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:55,523
Get your reports written and go home.

455
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,316
Jeez.

456
00:38:02,154 --> 00:38:03,197
So tell me.

457
00:38:03,823 --> 00:38:06,534
Are you really going to
let her keep the baby?

458
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,787
That's none of your business.

459
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:13,165
So keep your soft fists to yourself.

460
00:38:13,874 --> 00:38:15,668
You little…

461
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:18,087
I won't allow anyone
to touch my baby girl.

462
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,381
-Should I beat you up again?
-Hey.

463
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,677
Had you not cheated and bitten my ear,
you would've been long dead and gone.

464
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,971
Jeez, that little…

465
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,729
You're a lousy thug
who's an embarrassment to his own son.

466
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,654
You see,

467
00:38:44,447 --> 00:38:46,240
this is nothing

468
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,118
compared to what you did.

469
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:53,664
Hey.

470
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:55,458
Fine.

471
00:38:56,459 --> 00:38:58,669
Let me hear it. Okay?

472
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,881
Why do you hate me so much? Tell me.

473
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,093
Didn't I look out for you
from middle school to high school?

474
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:10,306
Whenever the other students hit you,
I retaliated for you.

475
00:39:10,389 --> 00:39:11,849
I even got hit for you at times.

476
00:39:11,932 --> 00:39:14,060
Since we're on the subject, tell me.

477
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,812
Didn't you always gamble away
the money I lent you?

478
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,690
Even after I told you to quit gambling.

479
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,360
But every time, you never listened.

480
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:25,946
So what did I do so wrong?

481
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:28,783
Did I have an affair with your wife?
What was it?

482
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:29,992
Tell me!

483
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,371
"Does it feel nice

484
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,916
to use your daughter for money?"

485
00:39:38,667 --> 00:39:40,419
"You dirt-poor loser."

486
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:44,590
The day my wife left,

487
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,346
I visited you with Yeong-ju
and asked for some money to buy food.

488
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,355
And that's what you said to me

489
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,191
in front of my baby girl.

490
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:05,444
Have you forgotten?

491
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,198
Because I could never forget that.

492
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,702
You were…

493
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:19,333
the only one I could rely on.

494
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:23,003
But you called me dirt-poor

495
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,840
in front of her.

496
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:33,013
You said I made her beg for money.

497
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,640
I wanted you to come to your senses.

498
00:40:35,391 --> 00:40:37,017
You kept losing money.

499
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,603
Then you wanted to be a thug like I was.

500
00:40:40,187 --> 00:40:41,021
Also,

501
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,899
"dirt-poor loser"
wasn't that harsh of a word.

502
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:48,028
Back then, you and I were close enough
to call each other by all kinds of names.

503
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,115
"Dirt-poor loser"
can hardly be called offensive.

504
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:52,908
You bastard.

505
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,870
But I was actually poor.

506
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,459
I was really dirt-poor.

507
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:10,342
I threw your money on the ground.

508
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,639
Then I borrowed money from Eun-hui…

509
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:21,520
who had left me for being poor.

510
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,193
Can you imagine how I felt?

511
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:31,280
How can I?

512
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:39,705
Damn it…

513
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,421
How did it feel
to get beaten by your own son?

514
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,138
Didn't it kill you?

515
00:41:58,849 --> 00:42:00,684
That was exactly…

516
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:04,396
how I felt.

517
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:03,998
Jeong-jun!

518
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,542
Yes?

519
00:43:07,084 --> 00:43:09,420
I have one question.

520
00:43:09,503 --> 00:43:14,258
Is Yeong-ok's mother really an artist?

521
00:43:15,342 --> 00:43:16,927
Come to your senses.

522
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,597
I spent millions of won
on buying her drinks.

523
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,308
That's the type of girl she is.

524
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,936
She seduces men with her smile
and makes them pay for her drinks.

525
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,938
And you're no exception, so be careful.

526
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,539
Are you aware

527
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:48,167
that Yeong-ok has been lying to everyone?

528
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:50,753
If not, take note of this.

529
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,796
We're going to kick her out.

530
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:57,301
She must have a man.
She gets a call from someone every day.

531
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,014
Why is Yeong-ok's phone always ringing?

532
00:44:18,447 --> 00:44:24,411
COULD I LOVE…

533
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,630
Could I love a liar?

534
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,809
No.

535
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:55,734
THEN WHAT…

536
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:14,711
Then what should I do?

537
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,464
YEONG-OK

538
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:40,404
I miss you.

539
00:45:50,539 --> 00:45:52,833
What about you, Captain?
Don't you miss me?

540
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,548
I do.

541
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,932
Do you want to go on a trip?

542
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,746
Oh, my goodness!

543
00:46:31,497 --> 00:46:32,831
What is it?

544
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:35,459
Goodness.

545
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:40,797
We had nowhere to go.

546
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,090
Oh, no.

547
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,721
Ma'am, please let us spend the night here.

548
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:23,423
-Hey! Stop right there!
-Move!

549
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:28,053
-Move!
-Goodness!

550
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,722
-Hey!
-In-gwon.

551
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,267
-Come here!
-Damn it!

552
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:36,019
-You bastard!
-In-gwon!

553
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,236
-Oh, no!
-Call 911!

554
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,179
Get your facts straight.

555
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,185
Mom never abandoned me.

556
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,857
She abandoned you.

557
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:30,073
Mother passed away.

558
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:33,702
I'm leaving you.

559
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:38,957
She wanted

560
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,918
to tell you something.

561
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:46,798
She doesn't want you
to be an embarrassment to your son.

562
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:02,731
I said, let go!

563
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:05,817
Do I embarrass you?

564
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,111
You've always been an embarrassment…

565
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:09,946
to me.

566
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:11,740
You bastard.

567
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:15,577
-I won't be your son anymore.
-You little…

568
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,079
I can't do it anymore!

569
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:55,992
Just let her have it. Don't be so cheap.

570
00:49:56,076 --> 00:49:58,286
Don't take back what you just gave.

571
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:02,290
Gosh.

572
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:09,631
How wonderful.

573
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,968
I can't believe
such young kids are becoming parents.

574
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,095
I'm proud of you.

575
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,097
Me too.

576
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:22,227
You told your father
that you're here, right?

577
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,062
Go home when he comes.

578
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:36,408
Did you tell In-gwon that Hyeon was here?

579
00:50:37,075 --> 00:50:40,454
I just apologized and hung up.

580
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,003
What was that?

581
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:38,887
What?

582
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:43,141
Hey!

583
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:45,852
What happened? Hey, wake up!

584
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:47,646
Wake up!

585
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,816
Wake up, will you?

586
00:51:50,899 --> 00:51:53,276
In-gwon!

587
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:56,321
Call an ambulance!

588
00:52:19,928 --> 00:52:21,638
He's up.

589
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,522
-You fainted.
-You're terminally ill.

590
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:34,609
It's acute diabetes.

591
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:38,321
Goodness. Do you not get checkups?

592
00:52:39,698 --> 00:52:41,908
I'm still young.

593
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:43,034
"Still young," my foot.

594
00:52:43,118 --> 00:52:45,287
You really need to take care of yourself.

595
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,831
Otherwise, you'll get complications
like arterial embolisms.

596
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,375
You'll have to cut off
the ends of your limbs.

597
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:54,087
Get your IV drip,
and I'll give you medicine for today.

598
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:56,464
-But you come back for proper treatment.
-Fine, whatever.

599
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:58,884
You need to have that wound
on your ear looked into.

600
00:53:08,852 --> 00:53:09,978
Water.

601
00:53:10,937 --> 00:53:12,063
Jeez.

602
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,777
Look at you ordering me around.

603
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,614
How did I get here?

604
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,076
The last thing I remember
is coming down the stairs.

605
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,661
Ho-sik carried you here.

606
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,373
Don't lie. He wouldn't do that.

607
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,752
Exactly. Why did he do that?

608
00:53:33,835 --> 00:53:36,046
He should've just let you die.

609
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,756
Why did he save you?

610
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,175
Hey.

611
00:53:40,258 --> 00:53:43,136
You and Ho-sik
are the only friends I have.

612
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:45,472
Can you please stop fighting?

613
00:53:47,849 --> 00:53:50,644
We're not your only friends.

614
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,145
You have Mi-ran.

615
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:54,648
Don't talk about her.

616
00:53:55,649 --> 00:53:59,152
Take care of yourself.
Pay me back before you die.

617
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,489
I'm going to work now.

618
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:06,117
What are you doing?

619
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,162
I need to boil sundae today.

620
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,708
Unbelievable.

621
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,546
Thanks.

622
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,634
Thank Ho-sik instead.

623
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,012
Gosh.

624
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:32,686
Hyeon.

625
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,397
Why is your father so stubborn?

626
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:57,293
We've decided
to respect the students' rights.

627
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:59,671
We'll let Yeong-ju and Hyeon
remain in school.

628
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,966
She can still come
even when she's pregnant.

629
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,763
So I hope you can forgive her too.

630
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:51,931
Is that really it?

631
00:55:54,851 --> 00:55:58,605
Are you going to leave
without saying anything to me?

632
00:56:15,288 --> 00:56:16,915
I'll find you a place.

633
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,126
You can live there…

634
00:56:22,712 --> 00:56:24,923
with Hyeon.

635
00:56:27,133 --> 00:56:28,802
Or with your baby.

636
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:31,721
Do as you please.

637
00:56:33,973 --> 00:56:37,560
Why can't you understand me
when my teachers and friends can?

638
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:38,812
Why?

639
00:56:45,068 --> 00:56:46,236
Are you happy?

640
00:56:49,572 --> 00:56:52,158
Since the teachers, your friends, Hyeon,

641
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,911
and your baby are all on your side,

642
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:58,039
does that make you happy?

643
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,041
Dad.

644
00:57:01,334 --> 00:57:02,544
Just say yes.

645
00:57:08,675 --> 00:57:10,009
You can't always

646
00:57:11,719 --> 00:57:13,638
have everything your way…

647
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:17,016
in life.

648
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,563
That's life.

649
00:57:26,734 --> 00:57:28,570
I'll never say that I was wrong.

650
00:57:29,404 --> 00:57:31,656
I'll never say
that this baby was a mistake.

651
00:57:32,532 --> 00:57:33,658
But still,

652
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:35,994
I'm so sorry.

653
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,713
I'm sorry for making you lonely.

654
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:55,722
I'm all that you have.

655
00:57:58,057 --> 00:58:01,102
I'm so sorry that I left you all alone.

656
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:10,111
But Dad.

657
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,364
I feel so alone too.

658
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:18,244
I have Hyeon and the baby.

659
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:24,167
But I don't have you.

660
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,056
Gosh.

661
00:59:20,139 --> 00:59:23,476
You destroyed my motorcycle
while on delivery?

662
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,520
What is wrong with you?

663
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:27,605
You better pay for the damages!

664
00:59:32,151 --> 00:59:34,445
This is all I have. I'm sorry.

665
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:40,868
Just go. Leave.

666

668
00:59:53,423 --> 00:59:54,299
All right.

669
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,594
Please hurry up and call me
if you want the house.

670
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:58,720
I will.

ABANG SUNDAE

673
01:01:02,575 --> 01:01:04,285
Don't bother me.

674
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,709
Get out.

675
01:01:54,293 --> 01:01:56,462
Ms. Jung told me that you had diabetes.

676
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:01,092
She said you refused treatment.

677
01:02:04,053 --> 01:02:07,140
-What's it to you?
-Diabetes is a serious illness.

678
01:02:08,766 --> 01:02:10,810
What if all your wounds get infected?

679
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:12,478
Then I'll just die.

680
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:13,604
Dad!

681
01:02:20,278 --> 01:02:21,571
Was I always…

682
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,241
an embarrassment to you?

683
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,037
Let me hear it.

684
01:02:32,373 --> 01:02:34,333
Why were you embarrassed?

685
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:36,419
Why?

686
01:02:37,962 --> 01:02:39,756
Because I'm ugly?

687
01:02:41,632 --> 01:02:43,468
That's not my fault.

688
01:02:45,136 --> 01:02:46,596
Or is it because

689
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:49,182
I boil pig heads

690
01:02:50,475 --> 01:02:52,310
and intestines here?

691
01:02:53,519 --> 01:02:54,771
No.

692
01:02:58,399 --> 01:03:01,027
I wanted to be
a father you could be proud of.

693
01:03:03,738 --> 01:03:05,490
I wanted to raise you well.

694
01:03:06,824 --> 01:03:09,911
That's why I spent
every single day working.

695
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:16,584
I worked hard cleaning pig intestines

696
01:03:16,667 --> 01:03:19,587
smelling all that blood.

697
01:03:20,755 --> 01:03:21,881
You see,

698
01:03:23,174 --> 01:03:27,094
I was nothing but a thug to your grandma.

699
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:31,557
So I have nothing to say to her.

700
01:03:33,476 --> 01:03:35,269
And that's why

701
01:03:36,312 --> 01:03:38,606
I didn't stop your mom from leaving me.

702
01:03:42,568 --> 01:03:45,363
But I've done

703
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,449
nothing shameful

704
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,954
in front of you.

705
01:04:06,717 --> 01:04:09,720
You're the only thing I have.

706
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:13,057
And you've always made me so proud.

707
01:04:15,101 --> 01:04:18,396
And you're telling me
that I was an embarrassment to you?

708
01:04:19,897 --> 01:04:22,233
And you refuse to be my son anymore?

709
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:24,944
Fine, you bastard.

710
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:28,906
I don't want to see you ever again!

711
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,714
I'm so sorry, Dad.

712
01:04:50,011 --> 01:04:52,597
I'm sorry…

713
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,727
I'm sorry, Dad…

714
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:11,198
I'm sorry…

715
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,877
How could you say that?

716
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:25,963
I…

717
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,299
I thought if I acted out…

718
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:14,428
he would take care of me.

719
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:18,307
I asked you to go on a trip with me,
but why haven't you replied?

720
01:06:18,391 --> 01:06:20,309
-Are you playing hard to get?
-Yes.

721
01:06:21,185 --> 01:06:22,561
You're not going to tell me some lie

722
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:25,106
like, "you were the only woman
in my life," are you?

723
01:06:25,189 --> 01:06:27,608
Smile. A big smile.

724
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:29,485
How is it?

725
01:06:29,568 --> 01:06:32,071
She hasn't come here in three days.

726
01:06:32,655 --> 01:06:34,824
-Just let me be!
-And what? Let you die?

727
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:36,450
Yes!

728
01:06:37,535 --> 01:06:38,494
Why did you do that to me?

729
01:06:42,915 --> 01:06:47,837
