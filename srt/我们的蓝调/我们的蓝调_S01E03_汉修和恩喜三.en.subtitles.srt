1
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:21,104
HAN-SU AND EUN-HUI

2
00:00:23,773 --> 00:00:25,692
MEMORIES OF MOKPO COME IN WAVES AFTER
A BITTERSWEET REUNION WITH AN OLD FRIEND

3
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:34,219
I MISS YOU

4
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:47,857
Wait.

5
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:49,984
I promise I'll go next month.

6
00:02:40,702 --> 00:02:45,915
NEXT MONTH WHEN?

7
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:02,181
THE SECOND SATURDAY…

8
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,350
The second Saturday of next month.

9
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:30,168
YOU BITCH

10
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:33,171
HAN-SU AND EUN-HUI 3

11
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,176
-Pick whatever you want!
-That punk.

12
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:42,847
Ma'am, here you go.

13
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,642
Hey, Han-suk.

14
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,020
I'll have a glass of soju.

15
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:55,818
With the sun out?
You're a tough one, Han-suk.

16
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:03,243
In-gwon.

17
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:06,371
How could my brother be so shameless?

18
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:10,041
We have fresh hairtail caught today!

19
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:13,378
We have hairtail! Hairtail!

20
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:15,255
-Here's your 3,000 won.
-Thanks.

21
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,422
What do you need?

22
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,591
-Cuttlefish.
-This is for you.

23
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:20,301
Come take a look.

24
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,346
Hey, ma'am.

25
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,056
An order for hairtail. Quickly.

26
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:27,850
All right. I'll have it
ready for you in a jiffy.

27
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:31,521
Hey, I remember how you fainted at school.

28
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:34,816
It was adorable.

29
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:39,279
It was so cute.

30
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:46,452
We've separated.

31
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,043
Excited?

32
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,337
-Me?
-Yes.

33
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,215
No, I'm not excited.

34
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:01,801
Yes, you are.
Even I can tell that you're excited.

35
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,512
Your knife is all over the place.

36
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:06,389
I'm scared to go near you.

37
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,849
-Me?
-Yes.

38
00:05:08,766 --> 00:05:09,851
Jeez.

39
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:12,854
You're wrong. I'm not excited.

40
00:05:13,438 --> 00:05:16,149
-Is it good to go?
-Yes, almost.

41
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,529
Something's up, right?

42
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,366
Don't even think about lying.
You know you can't fool me.

43
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:27,076
We have cuttlefish.

44
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,745
-We have cuttlefish.
-Thank you.

45
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,371
-Enjoy. Come again.
-Bye.

46
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:34,542
-I'm going to Mokpo.
-With whom?

47
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:37,879
No way. Your first love?

48
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,714
He's separated from his wife.

49
00:05:39,797 --> 00:05:40,631
Nice!

50
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,218
Get back to work.

51
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:46,220
Make it worthwhile.

52
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,805
Lose your virginity.

53
00:05:47,889 --> 00:05:49,474
You crazy brat!

54
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,226
Eun-hui, finally!

55
00:05:54,312 --> 00:05:56,439
-Oh, hello. What do you need?
-Hello.

56
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:57,690
-Mackerel.
-Cuttlefish.

57
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:03,321
I don't approve.

58
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,200
Just mind your own business.

59
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:11,412
After Dad died of an illness,
Mom, Han-yeong,

60
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,999
and I worked day and night
so we could pay for Han-su's tuition.

61
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,376
But he doesn't give a hoot about us.

62
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,128
Instead, he sells his house

63
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:22,632
and only cares
about his cunning wife and daughter.

64
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:24,050
Hey, come on.

65
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:27,011
If Bo-ram succeeds,
it won't just benefit Han-su.

66
00:06:27,095 --> 00:06:30,765
It'll be good for the entire family
including you, Han-yeong, and your mother.

67
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,518
Forget about that.
They can live happily on their own.

68
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,936
I just wish he wouldn't go around

69
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:37,855
asking people for money
after having sold his house.

70
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:40,733
Hey, you don't need to pay.

71
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,901
It's on the house.

72
00:06:44,445 --> 00:06:45,738
By the way, Han-suk…

73
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,200
how much money did Han-su ask for?

74
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,578
Since we're afraid of living alone

75
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,498
Our frozen dreams

76
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,335
We all want to believe

77
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:02,338
That it's beautiful and fun

78
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,842
But it's just an excuse

79
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,885
Eun-hui, you're a great singer.

80
00:07:08,719 --> 00:07:10,680
Her dream was to become a singer.

81
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,557
She's good enough to become one.

82
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,852
Our frozen dreams

83
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:18,855
Eun-hui is going to lose
her virginity this weekend.

84
00:07:18,938 --> 00:07:19,814
You crazy brat!

85
00:07:19,897 --> 00:07:22,275
I swear I'll kill you! Shut your trap!

86
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:23,651
You must have a death wish.

87
00:07:23,734 --> 00:07:25,153
She's going to Mokpo with her first love--

88
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,154
Hey, that's enough!

89
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,823
I know I'm nice to you and all,

90
00:07:28,906 --> 00:07:30,700
but learn to have some respect!

91
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,952
Goodness, I'm so scared.

92
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,124
She's going to sleep with a guy.

93
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:46,799
-Eun-hui's going to sleep with a guy.
-What?

94
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:50,011
She's going to sleep with a guy,
and she's really excited about it.

95
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:53,306
Really?

96
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,394
Byeol-i just asked if it's true

97
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:00,521
and told me that she's so happy for her.

98
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,694
You're dead.

99
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,279
-Come here.
-Why?

100
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:10,865
Why are you embarrassed? We're all close.

101
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:11,908
Get over here.

102
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:13,659
-Eun-hui, wait.
-What?

103
00:08:13,743 --> 00:08:15,369
-Having sex is good.
-What?

104
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:17,580
-You brat.
-Learn to have a little fun.

105
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,249
All you ever care about is making money.

106
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,335
-Come here.
-She only cares about money.

107
00:08:22,418 --> 00:08:23,544
Get over here.

108
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:26,714
I'll seal your mouth
with this spoonful of rice.

109
00:08:26,797 --> 00:08:28,049
-Fill it to the brim.
-She says

110
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,842
she'll fill her mouth up with rice.

111
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,093
Your darn mouth.

112
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,345
Stop!

113
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,471
No, stop!

114
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,850
Eun-hui!

115
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,269
Don't you dare clean your mouth.

116
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:43,940
Who's the guy
that Eun-hui brought with her last week?

117
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:47,193
He was handsome and manly.

118
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,986
He seemed well-educated.

119
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:52,990
Did he have big eyes and pale skin?

120
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,201
Is he her boyfriend?

121
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:57,787
Boyfriend, my foot.

122
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,290
He's a friend from high school
who went to university in Seoul.

123
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:04,293
He's the branch manager at SS Bank.
He recently got transferred.

124
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,294
I see.

125
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,921
So he came here to do sales?

126
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:08,923
Goodness.

127
00:09:11,133 --> 00:09:13,594
Was he tall like a hairtail?

128
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:16,180
He was unbelievably tall.

129
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:26,607
Hey, why did you bring Han-su
to the auction site?

130
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:29,318
The people at the market
are already saying

131
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:32,697
that you got yourself a boyfriend.
Do you know that?

132
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,490
What's with this nonsense?

133
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:36,242
I'm busy. Just hang up.

134
00:09:36,325 --> 00:09:37,618
You're a single woman.

135
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:40,746
You shouldn't be hanging around
with a married man.

136
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,540
Okay, I get it. That's enough.

137
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,752
-Are you at the auction site?
-Yes.

138
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,838
Did you eat breakfast?

139
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:52,883
You talk way too much.

140
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,760
You talk way more than everyone else.

141
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,596
This brat.

142
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:06,856
Is the auction over already?

143
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,859
Why didn't Eun-hui come today?

144
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,235
Is she sick?

145
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,529
What are you talking about?

146
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:16,115
We just talked on the phone.
She told me she was there.

147
00:10:16,198 --> 00:10:18,159
What do you mean? It was just Jeong-jun.

148
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,619
He already left with the fish.

149
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,124
What is he saying?

150
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,922
My gosh, what's with this guy? Seriously.

151
00:10:51,776 --> 00:10:52,735
Oh, right.

152
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,282
I heard you went out with Ho-sik.
Why did you guys break up?

153
00:10:58,366 --> 00:10:59,533
Jeez, come on.

154
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,120
That was over 20 years ago.
Who told you about that?

155
00:11:03,204 --> 00:11:05,581
Our friends told me at the reunion.

156
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,874
Unbelievable.

157
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:10,211
They seriously talk too much.

158
00:11:10,294 --> 00:11:12,129
People in Jeju are way too close.

159
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,841
I bet they even keep count
of their neighbors' underwear.

160
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,219
I'm sick and tired of it.

161
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:45,204
-What?
-Nothing.

162
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,961
I don't see any seagulls.
I bought this for them.

163
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,012
Do you want some?

164
00:12:07,893 --> 00:12:09,603
Eat it yourself.

165
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:26,996
Look at me.

166
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,671
What are you looking at?

167
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:38,674
I brushed off the crumbs.
Go back to enjoying the sea.

168
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:49,852
Look at me.

169
00:13:02,406 --> 00:13:03,574
There were crumbs.

170
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,118
Enjoy the sea.

171
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,838
Are you okay?
It must have gone down the wrong pipe.

172
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,299
Just a second. I'll go buy some water.

173
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:22,551
-It's okay.
-Wait here.

174
00:13:28,849 --> 00:13:30,726
She had to go to the mainland?

175
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:33,103
What business does she have
on the mainland?

176
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:34,522
Where exactly?

177
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,941
Mokpo. She went on a trip with a friend.

178
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,778
Hey. Your boss doesn't have any friends.

179
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:43,447
-Except for this ice seller and--
-This sundae seller.

180
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:49,912
Hey, Jeong-jun. Where is Eun-hui?

181
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,873
You don't know? Why don't you know?

182
00:13:53,707 --> 00:13:55,376
She went on a trip? With who?

183
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:57,711
Why didn't you ask?

184
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:00,631
You should've asked her
who she was going on a trip with.

185
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:02,758
What?

186
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:05,636
You're not interested in her private life?

187
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:07,429
This guy is full of shit.

188
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,889
What did Jeong-jun say?

189
00:14:09,515 --> 00:14:11,433
Don't talk to me.

190
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:14,436
Do you think I want to talk to you?

191
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,772
-It's because it's regarding Eun-hui.
-Damn it.

192
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:21,402
Damn you. I'd beat you to a pulp
if there was no law.

193
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:24,113
Hey, Myeong-bo. What's up?

194
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,950
What? Okay.

195
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:33,205
Yes. Okay, let's meet up.

196
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,374
You're meeting Myeong-bo? Why?

197
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,334
-To talk about Han-su.
-I'll go with you.

198
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,628
Hey, I'm off
to deliver sundae to a client.

199
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,255
Why would an ice seller like you
come with me?

200
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:42,840
-Aren't you meeting Myeong-bo?
-I am.

201
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,884
-When?
-At 2 p.m.

202
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:47,386
-Wait. Where?
-Where do you think?

203
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:48,429
Eun-hui's coffee shop?

204
00:14:48,512 --> 00:14:51,432
Why did you even ask? What an idiot.

205
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,648
BANG HO-SIK

206
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:02,401
My gosh, look at this guy.

207
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,487
I bet he's calling me like crazy

208
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,615
because he needs me for something.

209
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,867
Does he need to borrow money again?

210
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,703
I'm so fed up with this.

211
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,581
I'm already fed up with my family,

212
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:19,877
but it's the same with my friends.
They always ask me for money.

213
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,009
It's the smell of Mokpo!

214
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,643
The train bound to Mokpo

215
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:40,397
After the last train leaves

216
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,693
Do you know I wanted to become a singer?

217
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,613
Of course.

218
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,116
I always loved to hear you sing.

219
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:57,957
Do you think I would've made it
if I went to Seoul

220
00:15:59,041 --> 00:15:59,917
to become a singer?

221
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,921
Of course. You would've made it
if you gave it a shot.

222
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:08,258
Now that I'm with you,

223
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:12,680
I'm even starting to talk about
my long-forgotten dream.

224
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,391
It's nice to see an old friend.

225
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:23,732
Is this the end

226
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,527
Of our love…

227
00:16:27,027 --> 00:16:30,489
By the way, what did you want to be
when you were young?

228
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,664
A basketball player.

229
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,124
Are you serious?

230
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:44,712
I knew you always loved basketball,
but I didn't know it was your dream.

231
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,964
Studying was

232
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:50,217
never my cup of tea.

233
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:52,261
Then why didn't you try?

234
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:56,181
Forget it.

235
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,100
I can already guess why.

236
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:01,770
You couldn't because
you were the eldest of a poor family.

237
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,022
It just wasn't an option.

238
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,567
Your parents disapproved, right?

239
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,736
I didn't even dare to ask.

240
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,654
I gave up on my own.

241
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,076
Right. That's just how it is.

242
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,912
We both willingly gave up on our dreams.

243
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:22,666
We were both the eldest of poor families.

244
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,168
Our dreams didn't matter.

245
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,420
Damn it.

246
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,089
Being poor is sickening.

247
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:33,635
But at least we're no longer dirt-poor.

248
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:37,723
Thank goodness for that.

249
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,769
We're doing pretty well now.
Don't you agree?

250
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:52,905
Is this where our short-lived romance

251
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:55,824
Comes to an end…

252
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,911
-Jeez.
-Goodness.

253
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:01,413
I dressed too lightly,
and I ended up catching…

254
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,793
-Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm good.

255
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:10,089
I guess we were out on the deck
for way too long.

256
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:12,132
I should have worn thicker clothes.

257
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:18,388
-What is it?
-I'll go buy some medicine.

258
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:21,058
Don't bother. I'll get better
once I drink some warm water.

259
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,185
Have warm water with some medicine.

260
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:24,645
-I'll be right back.
-But…

261
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:31,276
JUJEONG PHARMACY

262
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,904
Goodness, look at him.

263
00:18:33,987 --> 00:18:36,281
It only took him ten steps to get there.

264
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:40,035
He really has long legs.

265
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,296
I'm a traitor to Ho-sik.

266
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,970
After we decided to go out,

267
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:02,850
I kissed him and even started
to get butterflies in my stomach.

268
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,895
But one day,

269
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,691
we went to Meonseom Island
to visit his family.

270
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,736
I met his parents
who grew barley for a living.

271
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:18,574
His grandparents were bedridden,

272
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,202
and his three younger sisters
worked at a farm.

273
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,497
On our way back home,

274
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:29,001
I suddenly felt hopeless

275
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,795
and couldn't do it anymore.

276
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,427
"I already have
four younger siblings of my own."

277
00:19:39,928 --> 00:19:42,764
"How am I going to support
his family as well?"

278
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,813
They never even asked me to support them.

279
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:58,906
Anyway, I suddenly felt
a huge burden on my shoulders.

280
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:05,287
So as soon as we got off the boat,
I went to the supermarket,

281
00:20:05,829 --> 00:20:07,748
drank an entire bottle of soju,

282
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,834
and told him the truth.

283
00:20:12,878 --> 00:20:15,672
"Ho-sik, I'm sick of being poor."

284
00:20:16,757 --> 00:20:19,259
"But if I stay with you,
I think it'll stay that way."

285
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,262
"Let's end it. I'm sorry."

286
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,061
Ho-sik couldn't say anything.

287
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:32,397
Instead, he held my hands
and cried his eyes out.

288
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:42,032
Ho-sik went through a bad phase
because of what happened.

289
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:47,287
He tried to become a thug
and even gambled.

290
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,126
It really taught me
what kind of person I was.

291
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,378
I realized that

292
00:20:55,629 --> 00:20:59,216
I didn't care about love or romance.
All I cared about was money.

293
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:02,219
That's what I learned about myself.

294
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,394
Hey, remember when you moved
your mother to Seoul?

295
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:13,563
Why did you take her
without even telling us?

296
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:15,357
You left like you were on the run.

297
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:20,070
Back then, we were all disappointed in you
because of what happened.

298
00:21:29,162 --> 00:21:30,497
I was

299
00:21:31,665 --> 00:21:33,709
too ashamed to face you guys.

300
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:39,673
You say you betrayed Ho-sik,

301
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,718
but as for me…

302
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:46,930
I betrayed my mom,

303
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,559
my two siblings, Han-yeong and Han-suk,

304
00:21:52,936 --> 00:21:56,273
and my late father who asked me
to take good care of the family.

305
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:01,486
Even you and the other guys.

306
00:22:05,907 --> 00:22:07,701
I'll always be a traitor to everyone.

307
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:17,461
I'm sorry.

308
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,008
I bet you all had faith in me.

309
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,513
Hey, don't sweat it.

310
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:33,101
Things like that can happen
when you're a family man.

311
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,316
Plus, being the eldest
doesn't mean you have to be perfect.

312
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:40,525
Jeez.

313
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,450
This is beautiful.

314
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:49,868
Look at the view.

315
00:22:49,951 --> 00:22:52,579
I get why they get so many tourists here.

316
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,873
It's pretty.

317
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,460
Over there.

318
00:23:00,003 --> 00:23:01,129
Right.

319
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,884
There too. Look over there.

320
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,344
Isn't it pretty?

321
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,763
Yes.

322
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:18,939
MOKPO MODERN HISTORY MUSEUM

323
00:23:19,022 --> 00:23:21,525
I don't even recognize this place anymore.

324
00:23:21,608 --> 00:23:22,943
So much has changed.

325
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:27,823
I think I faintly remember this place.

326
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:46,883
Hey!

327
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:49,177
Follow me.

328
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,555
-Hey!
-Wait up!

329
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,515
Let's go!

330
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,646
-Hey!
-Come on!

331
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:01,940
-Give it!
-Stop!

332
00:24:02,023 --> 00:24:04,401
-Give it!
-Hey, careful! You'll trip!

333
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,118
Give me that!

334
00:24:13,702 --> 00:24:16,121
Give it to me!

335
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:17,247
Give it!

336
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:21,418
-Let's go!
-Wait!

337
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,212
-Go!
-Let's go!

338
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:26,131
Be careful!

339
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,344
I told you not to eat it!

340
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:33,763
I told you not to eat it!

341
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,265
Give it back to me!

342
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:19,017
I like you. I'll be yours.

343
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,352
Or you can be mine.

344
00:25:24,397 --> 00:25:26,024
Yes, sure. Let's go, Eun-hui.

345
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,575
BAEKHWA REAL ESTATE

346
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,876
Goodness.

347
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:47,128
This spot hasn't changed at all.

348
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,678
I guess you remember this alley.

349
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:56,972
Of course.

350
00:25:58,932 --> 00:26:01,768
We were adorable back then, weren't we?

351
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,438
We were.

352
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:25,417
Now, we can afford to eat one each.

353
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:29,462
Back then, five of us had to share two.

354
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:32,173
Do you remember, back then?

355
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:34,968
See you.

356
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:36,469
-See you later.
-Bye.

357
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,935
It's really sweet.

358
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:48,523
Because it's sugar.

359
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,371
Your arm falls right on my shoulder,

360
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:05,540
just like when we were young.

361
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,589
Do you want me
to take my arm off your shoulder?

362
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,050
No, you can leave it.

363
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,260
It's no big deal. We're friends.

364
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:32,484
Damn it.

365
00:27:46,664 --> 00:27:48,708
-Open the door.
-You do it.

366
00:27:49,751 --> 00:27:50,835
Come in.

367
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,257
Damn it.

368
00:27:57,467 --> 00:28:00,261
-The tall guy has the best skills.
-He really does.

369
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:01,346
-Yes.
-Nice.

370
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:13,983
-By the way, Eun-hui.
-Yes?

371
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,069
Well…

372
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,364
Didn't anyone try
to set you up on a blind date?

373
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:20,532
A blind date?

374
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,576
People ask me
at least once or twice a month.

375
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,413
I just never agree to go on one.
I get tons of offers.

376
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:29,666
Do you know why? It's because I'm rich.

377
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,838
But I'll be honest with you.

378
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:38,091
When someone asks me
to go on a blind date at my age,

379
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,301
I instantly become suspicious and picky.

380
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,722
"What if the guy's sick?"

381
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,057
"I wonder if he has a stable job."

382
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:48,309
"Maybe he wants to meet me
because I'm rich."

383
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:50,979
Here's what's worse.

384
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,691
If the guy is the eldest son
taking care of his elderly parents,

385
00:28:54,774 --> 00:28:57,652
I don't even consider meeting him at all.

386
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,655
I'm horrible, aren't I?

387
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,324
No, it's understandable.

388
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:06,494
No, it's not.

389
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,455
Don't try to comfort me.

390
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:13,293
I think I'm turning into an awful person.

391
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:18,173
I measure the pros and cons
even when it comes to love.

392
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,009
I'm a horrible person
who only cares about my interests.

393
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:25,597
I bet I'll die all alone.

394
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,108
Hey, why did you decide
to split up with your wife?

395
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,110
-Let's go. You pay.
-Wait.

396
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:41,237
I'm not paying.

397
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:42,864
No reason.

398
00:29:43,865 --> 00:29:45,325
I'm just a bad husband.

399
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:49,078
Don't tell me you're cheating on her.

400
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,289
No.

401
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,460
I'm just not competent enough.

402
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:14,521
Hey, you're not incompetent.

403
00:30:14,604 --> 00:30:17,065
You're the branch manager of a bank.

404
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,025
You even sent your daughter abroad
to become a golfer.

405
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:25,698
I saw your daughter on TV once.
She looks so pretty, just like you.

406
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:28,034
Eun-hui.

407
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,995
I want to hear you sing.

408
00:30:31,955 --> 00:30:35,500
My long-forgotten dreams

409
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:38,878
Are coming back to me one by one

410
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,840
Now that I'm full of hope

411
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,468
My heart is starting to flutter

412
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:46,970
Hey, pass me the ball.

413
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:54,018
-Hey.
-Darn it. It didn't go in.

414
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:57,188
Try it one more time.
Here we go. One, two, three!

415
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:09,158
I scored a point! I put it in!

416
00:31:10,535 --> 00:31:12,287
MI-JIN

417
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,414
I can see it

418
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:18,084
Let's go search for our hope

419
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,465
What are you doing?

420
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:28,344
Did you call us here just to sigh?
Stop being frustrating.

421
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,018
Did Han-su ask you for money?

422
00:31:36,144 --> 00:31:37,395
What do you mean?

423
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:42,984
Han-su asked his little sister, Han-suk,
to lend him 200 million won.

424
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:44,819
Two hundred million?

425
00:31:45,445 --> 00:31:46,571
That's nuts.

426
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:16,517
Room 1001.

427
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,116
Here.

428
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:37,121
Just one room?

429
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,582
No.

430
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,876
My room is right here. This is yours.

431
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:48,091
That almost gave me butterflies
for a second.

432
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,233
Goodness.

433
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,655
My gosh.

434
00:33:16,411 --> 00:33:19,372
Hey, isn't this place…

435
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:21,249
Yes, that's right.

436
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:25,211
The old inn that we stayed at
during our field trip.

437
00:33:26,212 --> 00:33:28,006
This is where it used to be.

438
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,344
I see.

439
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:38,099
So they got rid of the inn
and built this in its place.

440
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:46,065
But don't you think
this place is too fancy for us?

441
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,486
It's also my first time
coming to a five-star hotel.

442
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,613
But come on.

443
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,617
This is our first and last trip
down memory lane.

444
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:00,329
We deserve it.

445
00:34:01,497 --> 00:34:03,041
-A trip down memory lane?
-Yes.

446
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,087
Fine. It's our first and last trip
down memory lane.

447
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:10,048
I guess we can spend this much.

448
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:13,676
Look at that.

449
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,514
The bed is really nice.

450
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:20,600
Are you happy?

451
00:34:22,685 --> 00:34:23,770
Let's check out…

452
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:28,024
I can practically ice skate in here.

453
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,942
And the tub is huge.

454
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,361
-What's this?
-It's nice, isn't it?

455
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:33,529
Hey.

456
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:36,157
These aren't free, right?

457
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,409
I know that much.

458
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,494
Right.

459
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:44,415
Do you want to have a drink?
Let's buy some at the supermarket.

460
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:47,335
Sure. I'll go buy them.

461
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,544
-Wait here.
-Okay.

462
00:34:55,843 --> 00:34:57,095
This is so fancy.

463
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,398
It's nice and clean.

464
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:24,539
I must be crazy.

465
00:35:30,628 --> 00:35:33,506
Why didn't I ever think
of coming to a place like this?

466
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,730
It's like my phone is on fire.

467
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,608
Why do you keep calling me?

468
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,443
Where are…

469
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,697
EUN-HUI

470
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,116
Did you go to Mokpo with Han-su?

471
00:36:01,075 --> 00:36:02,952
Yes, we came to Mokpo together.

472
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,996
You got a problem with that?

473
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:08,958
Why would you go to Mokpo
with a married guy?

474
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,668
Married, my foot.

475
00:36:11,252 --> 00:36:14,046
They separated seven years ago
and are going to get a divorce.

476
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,132
Guys, come on.

477
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:19,093
Why is she on speaker?
We have other customers.

478
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,015
That was rude, In-gwon.

479
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,309
Pretend like I was never here.

480
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:33,024
Hello?

481
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,402
Jeez, what's their problem?

482
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:38,070
Damn it.

483
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:45,369
The blue sky calls me from afar…

484
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:46,621
Han-su's getting a divorce?

485
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:48,998
Ask Hyeong-sik.

486
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,458
Now!

487
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,335
Their families are close to each other.

488
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,712
You guys are unbelievable.

489
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,344
Hey, Hyeong-sik.

490
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,472
I have something to ask you.

491
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,894
-Who is it? Han-su, is that you?
-Yes.

492
00:37:11,437 --> 00:37:12,980
Hey, sorry. Can I have my jacket?

493
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:15,775
My wallet's inside. I forgot to bring it.

494
00:37:15,858 --> 00:37:16,984
Okay. Just a second.

495
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:27,912
-Thanks.
-Here.

496
00:37:27,995 --> 00:37:29,872
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

497
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,794
-Slow down. You'll hurt yourself.
-Okay.

498
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,397
Damn it.

499
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:15,209
KIM MYEONG-BO

500
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:19,672
Han-su's obviously after Eun-hui's money.

501
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:21,424
What's going on?

502
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,134
It's none of your business.

503
00:38:23,217 --> 00:38:24,468
Just take that over.

504
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,307
INCOMING CALL

505
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,397
Hey, it's me. I'm listening.

506
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,906
I love you too. It's not just one-sided.

507
00:38:56,292 --> 00:39:02,048
PUREUNG

508
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,146
How many times must I tell you?

509
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,273
I love you too.

510
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,385
BO-RAM

511
00:40:18,958 --> 00:40:21,252
INCOMING VIDEO CALL
BO-RAM

512
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:22,253
CONNECTING

513
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:24,213
What is it?

514
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,132
Dad.

515
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,926
I want to go to Seoul.

516
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,390
Don't give me that nonsense.

517
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,225
Dad, I'm serious.

518
00:40:36,308 --> 00:40:38,310
I'm not happy when I play golf.

519
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:42,523
I want to quit.

520
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:48,571
Stop lying to me.

521
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:51,532
You're just saying that
because of the money.

522
00:40:51,615 --> 00:40:54,201
Golf means everything to you.

523
00:40:56,829 --> 00:40:58,539
I know that better than anyone.

524
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:02,251
Bo-ram says she isn't happy.

525
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,044
Why won't you believe her?

526
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:05,796
That's because…

527
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,926
Think about it.

528
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:17,433
It's because you keep complaining
about money in front of her.

529
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:20,895
That's why she's saying that.

530
00:41:23,606 --> 00:41:25,483
I want to go to Seoul, Dad.

531
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:30,571
I no longer feel happy
when I play golf. I'm serious.

532
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,407
Why aren't you happy? Why?

533
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:37,286
Why don't you feel happy?

534
00:41:38,162 --> 00:41:39,580
You punk!

535
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:43,292
Hey.

536
00:41:45,461 --> 00:41:51,342
Do you know how hard I tried
to make you happy?

537
00:41:51,425 --> 00:41:52,843
But if you're not happy,

538
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:56,138
what am I supposed to do now, you punk?

539
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:02,770
Bo-ram.

540
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:10,402
Bo-ram.

541
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,404
You're just

542
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,908
feeling that way
because you have the yips.

543
00:42:17,618 --> 00:42:19,995
It'll all pass. So just hold on.

544
00:42:23,958 --> 00:42:25,876
Do you know why I hurt my lips?

545
00:42:26,961 --> 00:42:30,464
I ran into a thug with a gun
and got beaten up.

546
00:42:31,423 --> 00:42:33,509
I'd be dead if it weren't for a passerby.

547
00:42:34,176 --> 00:42:36,720
Bo-ram would have gotten hurt
if she was there.

548
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:40,975
You're not doing this for Bo-ram.

549
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,393
What's the matter?

550
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:45,479
Do you think it'll be devastating
if she quits playing golf?

551
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:48,357
Just stop…

552
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,901
Will you please just stop?

553
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:03,205
Gosh.

554
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,337
Damn it.

555
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:19,763
For goodness' sake.

556
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:25,769
Damn it.

557
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,807
Eun-hui.

558
00:44:07,186 --> 00:44:09,188
Can you lend me some money?

559
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,942
Eun-hui.

560
00:44:15,778 --> 00:44:17,488
Can you lend me…

561
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,830
Eun-hui, I…

562
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:30,959
I'm sorry.

563
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:36,507
But can you please lend me some…

564
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:56,527
JUNG IN-GWON

565
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,324
Hey, why did you send me these photos?

566
00:45:02,408 --> 00:45:05,285
Why do you think? To prove that
Han-su and his wife are on good terms.

567
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:08,831
Do you seriously believe
that they separated seven years ago?

568
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,961
Han-su's wife uploaded those photos
on her social media page last year.

569
00:45:14,044 --> 00:45:15,963
Hyeong-sik downloaded them
and sent them to Myeong-bo.

570
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,798
Then Myeong-bo sent them to you.

571
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:20,634
I heard they're still mad for each other.

572
00:45:20,717 --> 00:45:22,970
They're not getting a damn divorce.

573
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:26,265
Eun-hui, did Han-su ask you for money?

574
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,601
-No.
-He will soon.

575
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:33,814
-I'm sorry, Eun-hui.
-Why are you sorry?

576
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:36,066
Last year, he already borrowed
50 million won from Jae-min,

577
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:38,277
our friend from middle school.

578
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:41,280
He pays him interest.
Twenty percent a month.

579
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:45,117
He even asked Hyeong-sik
for 200 million but got rejected.

580
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,579
Hyeong-sik used his wife as an excuse
and told him to invest in stocks

581
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:50,622
to change the subject.

582
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,042
He also asked Han-suk
for 200 million but got rejected.

583
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,462
You're his next target, okay?

584
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:59,715
Han-su doesn't even own a house.

585
00:45:59,798 --> 00:46:02,885
He has an empty bank account
and huge debt.

586
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:06,305
He even spent most of his severance pay.
There's not much left of it.

587
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:10,058
What does he need

588
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:12,769
all that money for?

589
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:16,231
I think his daughter's golf lessons
cost a lot of money.

590
00:46:21,069 --> 00:46:22,362
Bullshit.

591
00:46:22,446 --> 00:46:25,199
He shouldn't have had her
if he couldn't afford to raise her.

592
00:46:26,617 --> 00:46:29,077
Don't be so harsh. You're a father too.

593
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:33,290
I know my place.
I would never tell my kid to play golf.

594
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:40,547
Han-su's wife went to college
with Hyeong-sik's wife.

595
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:42,925
According to her,
Han-su's wife is pretty and kind.

596
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:44,760
She's warm and has common sense.

597
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:48,931
But apparently, her life got ruined
after she met Han-su.

598
00:46:49,014 --> 00:46:52,059
-She's really unhappy.
-Eun-hui.

599
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,103
If you lend money to Han-su,
you won't ever get it back.

600
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,773
He promised Jae-min
to pay him back in six months,

601
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:01,151
but it's been two years,
and he still hasn't paid him back.

602
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,530
Come back to Jeju right now.
Come home right now!

603
00:47:06,573 --> 00:47:07,783
Tomorrow…

604
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,622
I'm having breakfast here.

605
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,129
EUN-HUI

606
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:22,631
Eun-hui.

607
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:23,757
Eun-hui.

608
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,133
Eun-hui!

609
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:28,845
She hung up, damn it.

610
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:31,348
Are you a nutjob?

611
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,356
Eating cheese with wine.

612
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,109
I only saw it on TV.

613
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:25,986
It tastes nice.

614
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:27,946
Right.

615
00:48:30,532 --> 00:48:32,409
How do you know this kind of stuff?

616
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:36,580
There were crumbs. Enjoy the sea.

617
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:42,794
When you're in sales,

618
00:48:43,795 --> 00:48:47,215
you sometimes eat stuff like this
with your clients.

619
00:48:52,512 --> 00:48:54,139
Do you often drink wine

620
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,184
with your wife as well?

621
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:58,935
What?

622
00:49:00,145 --> 00:49:02,939
Gosh, my wife?

623
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:14,159
I will always be ready to run over

624
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:18,455
To meet you in your lovely dreams

625
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,505
Have another glass.

626
00:49:50,404 --> 00:49:51,530
What should we do now?

627
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:55,200
Well…

628
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,706
We can keep drinking this.

629
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:05,961
We went sightseeing
in the afternoon together.

630
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,882
Then we came

631
00:50:11,883 --> 00:50:13,343
to a hotel together.

632
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:16,513
Now, we're drinking.

633
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,351
Then what?

634
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:27,899
What should we do next?

635
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:36,241
Are we going to take a bath?

636
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,704
And then,

637
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:46,168
are we going to sleep together?

638
00:50:46,918 --> 00:50:48,128
Is that next?

639
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,550
Or…

640
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,513
will I finally get to hear

641
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:04,186
why you really dragged me here?

642
00:51:11,193 --> 00:51:12,402
Do you want me

643
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,489
to lend you money?

644
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,374
How much of it was a lie?

645
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:33,215
I only just found out
that you needed money.

646
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:40,180
Look at this.

647
00:51:46,853 --> 00:51:49,856
KIM MYEONG-BO

648
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,487
This is Jeju, not Seoul.

649
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,617
It's the kind of place
where people like to keep count

650
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:04,621
of their neighbors' underwear and cutlery.

651
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,128
You underestimated Jeju

652
00:52:13,129 --> 00:52:15,298
as well as In-gwon, Ho-sik, Myeong-bo,

653
00:52:17,384 --> 00:52:20,178
and all your other friends.

654
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,266
If you needed money,

655
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:28,144
you could have just asked.

656
00:52:30,272 --> 00:52:31,773
But why did you…

657
00:52:37,445 --> 00:52:38,905
You lied…

658
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,701
that you separated from your wife,

659
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:46,496
and told me you were getting a divorce.

660
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,832
Eun-hui.

661
00:52:54,963 --> 00:52:56,464
Not everything…

662
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,260
was a lie.

663
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:03,805
This trip…

664
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:08,518
really meant…

665
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:12,480
a lot to me too.

666
00:53:13,064 --> 00:53:13,899
It was…

667
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:23,366
Hey.

668
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:27,787
What am I to you?

669
00:53:30,081 --> 00:53:33,126
Do you even consider me your friend?

670
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:38,006
If you truly thought of me as your friend,

671
00:53:39,215 --> 00:53:41,468
you should have been
honest with me from the start

672
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:43,970
instead of dragging me here.

673
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:48,975
The fact that you lied to me
about your wife

674
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:53,063
and told me you were getting a divorce
shows that I wasn't a friend to you.

675
00:53:54,773 --> 00:53:56,608
You just thought of me as an idiot

676
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,404
who was head over heels for you.
Am I right?

677
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,866
You used my feelings, didn't you?

678
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,869
Yes.

679
00:54:12,666 --> 00:54:14,292
I wanted to use you…

680
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,754
if I could.

681
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,551
I didn't want my daughter

682
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,680
to give up on her dream…

683
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,310
like I did because of money.

684
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,440
Because I know how it feels to live…

685
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,528
with nothing to dream about.

686
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:48,952
Today…

687
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:52,205
I just lost…

688
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:57,085
a lifelong friend.

689
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,261
Leave.

690
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:53,576
Do you want to know…

691
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:58,748
why I didn't ask you
for money from the start?

692
00:57:03,378 --> 00:57:05,296
You didn't seem to have

693
00:57:06,631 --> 00:57:08,716
any joy in life.

694
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:14,222
All you do is chop fish.

695
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:17,058
You make money…

696
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,813
and use that money
to support your younger siblings.

697
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:26,985
I didn't want to ruin

698
00:57:28,903 --> 00:57:31,531
the good memories you had of me…

699
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,286
by asking you for money.

700
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:42,292
But still…

701
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,007
Even so,

702
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:53,303
I'm really sorry, my friend.

703
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,765
I'm sorry.

704
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:42,745
BANG HO-SIK

705
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,465
Did you lend money to Han-su or not?

706
00:59:57,176 --> 00:59:58,678
I didn't.

707
00:59:59,887 --> 01:00:02,765
I didn't lend him any money!
I didn't, okay?

708
01:00:08,062 --> 01:00:09,856
But how are you guys any different?

709
01:00:11,482 --> 01:00:14,485
Both you and In-gwon…

710
01:00:16,321 --> 01:00:18,656
always borrow money from me.

711
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:23,995
So why can't I lend money to Han-su?

712
01:00:25,580 --> 01:00:26,581
Tell me.

713
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,333
Why?

714
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:30,793
Why?

715
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,254
He lied to you.
That's not what friends do.

716
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:38,509
Maybe he lied for a reason.

717
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:41,554
-What reason?
-Why would he lie to a friend?

718
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,224
"Friend"?

719
01:00:47,518 --> 01:00:49,854
Do you think you guys are his friends?

720
01:00:50,688 --> 01:00:52,023
What a joke.

721
01:00:53,191 --> 01:00:56,277
What kind of friend is Hyeong-sik?

722
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:59,781
He used his wife and stocks as an excuse

723
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:02,158
and didn't lend him money
even when he could.

724
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,702
Then he goes around
telling that to everyone.

725
01:01:04,786 --> 01:01:06,954
And even though Jae-min lent him money,

726
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,084
he makes him pay an interest rate
of 20 percent like a loan shark.

727
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:16,589
Meanwhile, you guys were busy
doing a background check on him

728
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,591
so you could dig up dirt on him.

729
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,094
As for me,

730
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,346
I destroyed his ego.

731
01:01:24,097 --> 01:01:26,641
That's because we care
more about you than Han-su.

732
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,226
Why do you care more about me?

733
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:29,894
Because I have money?

734
01:01:29,977 --> 01:01:32,063
-Hey, what do you mean?
-Are you kidding?

735
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:33,981
Can't you see where this is coming from?

736
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,943
You should've cared for both me and Han-su

737
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,655
no matter how rich or poor we may be.

738
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:45,243
Damn it.

739
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,453
Why are you leaving?

740
01:01:48,204 --> 01:01:50,540
Eun-hui's right.
I have nothing left to say.

741
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:53,668
That little…

742
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,797
Listen. We're upset too--

743
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,258
We're not his friends.

744
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:02,760
Neither one of us

745
01:02:03,970 --> 01:02:05,930
deserve to say we're his friend.

746
01:02:08,516 --> 01:02:11,227
He came to see us
thinking we were friends.

747
01:02:12,395 --> 01:02:16,315
But even now, we're still
talking about him behind his back!

748
01:03:02,195 --> 01:03:03,738
Why aren't you angry?

749
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:08,284
Instead of listening to you,
we came to the airport to go to Seoul.

750
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:11,537
I don't know.

751
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:15,249
I'm not angry for some reason.

752
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:17,752
Be honest.

753
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:20,630
Don't you feel relieved?

754
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,219
Yes.

755
01:03:27,887 --> 01:03:29,180
I do.

756
01:03:31,432 --> 01:03:32,934
But Mi-jin.

757
01:03:35,061 --> 01:03:36,771
What if Bo-ram…

758
01:03:38,898 --> 01:03:40,900
ends up resenting us?

759
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:43,277
We'll just have to bear with it.

760
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:47,448
But let's just believe what she tells us.

761
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,201
That she doesn't enjoy playing golf.

762
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,538
People always change their minds.

763
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,500
The thing that makes you happy
can suddenly make you miserable.

764
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:01,838
Does that mean
we can also become happy one day

765
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:05,716
even though things aren't
going so well right now?

766
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,510
Of course.

767
01:04:09,762 --> 01:04:12,807
She was so excited that
she even sang on our way to the airport.

768
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,559
Do you know that?

769
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,519
I'm glad to hear that.

770
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:18,813
I'm relieved.

771
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:22,316
You did everything you could.

772
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,656
You too.

773
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:32,410
You went through a lot.

774
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:38,207
Bo-ram's coming. We'll see you in Seoul.

775
01:05:03,524 --> 01:05:05,860
RESIGNATION LETTER

776
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,073
Myeong-bo.

777
01:05:11,699 --> 01:05:13,993
I'd like to resign voluntarily.

778
01:05:15,536 --> 01:05:18,706
I'll explain everything over the phone.

779
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:22,168
I'm sorry.

780
01:06:21,602 --> 01:06:22,937
JUNG EUN-HUI HAS WIRED
200,000,000 WON TO YOUR ACCOUNT

781
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:24,188
JUNG EUN-HUI

782
01:06:27,483 --> 01:06:30,403
When you run a business,
you sometimes lose money.

783
01:06:31,654 --> 01:06:34,615
Let's just say
I lost some money this year.

784
01:06:35,449 --> 01:06:38,035
I've had times
when business didn't go well,

785
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:40,162
so don't worry about it
and take the money.

786
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:16,115
Getting old

787
01:07:16,866 --> 01:07:22,329
Isn't necessarily bad

788
01:07:23,372 --> 01:07:29,420
You can't pretend to age gracefully

789
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:04,080
SS BANK

790
01:08:07,583 --> 01:08:11,962
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

791
01:08:15,132 --> 01:08:16,967
CHOI HAN-SU HAS WIRED
200,000,000 WON TO YOUR ACCOUNT

792
01:08:17,051 --> 01:08:17,968
HAN-SU

793
01:08:21,972 --> 01:08:23,307
Eun-hui…

794
01:08:24,600 --> 01:08:26,602
I wired your money back.

795
01:08:37,571 --> 01:08:38,489
Over here.

796
01:08:38,572 --> 01:08:42,409
You always give more
than what you receive from others.

797
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:46,789
I don't want you to do the same with me.

798
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:48,415
You did great.

799
01:08:48,499 --> 01:08:50,668
Although I wired your money back,

800
01:08:50,751 --> 01:08:53,212
I'm still grateful for the kind gesture.

801
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,296
You did great.

802
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,132
-Let's go.
-Eun-hui.

803
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:59,051
-Look at you.
-I really learned a lot

804
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:01,595
from my stay at Jeju.

805
01:09:02,429 --> 01:09:06,016
-You guys went through so much.
-You, In-gwon, Ho-sik, and Myeong-bo.

806
01:09:06,684 --> 01:09:09,520
I was able to become friends again
with all those people

807
01:09:10,521 --> 01:09:12,189
whom I thought I had lost.

808
01:09:29,498 --> 01:09:31,333
We're going straight on a trip?

809
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,629
I got a pretty big severance pay
because I resigned voluntarily.

810
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:38,048
There won't be much left
after we pay off our debt,

811
01:09:38,883 --> 01:09:42,094
but let's have fun for now.

812
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,263
This is so nice. Let's go.

813
01:09:45,639 --> 01:09:47,141
Where are we going?

814
01:09:47,224 --> 01:09:48,642
-Where?
-Where are we going?

815
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:50,895
I thought about a few places. First…

816
01:09:50,978 --> 01:09:53,230
I don't know
what I'm going to do for a living.

817
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:56,358
But my heartbroken family's back in Seoul,

818
01:09:56,442 --> 01:10:00,196
so I'm thinking about
going on a road trip with them.

819
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,238
In that process,

820
01:10:01,322 --> 01:10:06,368
I'm sure I'll figure out
what it is that I should do for a living.

821
01:10:07,995 --> 01:10:10,623
Let's move on to the next one.
Come this way.

822
01:10:10,706 --> 01:10:12,249
Here's our next boat.

823
01:10:12,333 --> 01:10:15,586
They're from the Woori. Cutlass hairtails.

824
01:10:15,669 --> 01:10:19,006
Cutlass hairtails from the Woori.

825
01:10:19,089 --> 01:10:21,383
Take a good look.

826
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:24,011
Write down your numbers. EUNHUI'S

827
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:25,304
FISH MARKET

828
01:10:30,142 --> 01:10:33,479
Let's see. All right.
132,000 won. Sold to number 33.

829
01:10:33,562 --> 01:10:36,357
Sold to number 33 at 132,000 won.

830
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,778
And one day, when life becomes difficult,

831
01:10:41,612 --> 01:10:44,114
-I'll think about you
-Fresh hairtail caught today!

832
01:10:44,198 --> 01:10:46,033
and all the other friends in Jeju.

833
01:10:46,617 --> 01:10:49,328
-Come and take a look.
-That will give me strength.

834
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:51,413
-Cuttlefish, hairtail!
-Because it can't be

835
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,999
any more difficult
than what you guys are going through.

836
01:10:54,833 --> 01:10:55,668
Goodness.

837
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:57,670
Come and take a look at our fish.

838
01:10:57,753 --> 01:11:01,423
-We have hairtail. Fresh hairtail.
-The next time we meet,

839
01:11:01,507 --> 01:11:04,677
let's go to the beach and drink soju

840
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:08,597
with In-gwon, Ho-sik, and Myeong-bo.

841
01:11:09,306 --> 01:11:11,308
It'll be on me.

842
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,103
I hope

843
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,522
you'll sing for us that day.

844
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:19,400
I can't wait for that day to come.

845
01:11:20,484 --> 01:11:22,236
From your forever friend,

846
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,321
Han-su.

847
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:31,412
Sounds great.
You'd better come and buy us drinks.

848
01:11:33,664 --> 01:11:35,958
We'll be waiting for you by the sea.

849
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,043
Take good care of yourself.

850
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:17,041
MY ETERNAL FIRST LOVE

851
01:12:25,966 --> 01:12:30,304
CHOI HAN-SU

852
01:12:38,062 --> 01:12:44,860
GOODBYE

853
01:13:03,921 --> 01:13:07,132
Come to think of it

854
01:13:07,216 --> 01:13:10,969
It was my birthday that day

855
01:13:12,763 --> 01:13:15,808
Getting old

856
01:13:16,475 --> 01:13:20,562
Isn't necessarily bad

857
01:13:20,646 --> 01:13:22,231
Hey! You…

858
01:13:22,981 --> 01:13:24,274
Is that you?

859
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,673
It's almost cooked.

860
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:48,924
-Hurry.
-Just a bit more.

861
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:51,593
-This one's all cooked.
-Let's eat it.

862
01:13:51,677 --> 01:13:53,762
Okay. Thanks.

863
01:13:53,846 --> 01:13:54,972
-Here. Why?
-Don't.

864
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:55,889
It's fine.

865
01:13:55,973 --> 01:13:58,267
-Don't drink.
-To our happiness.

866
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,018
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

867
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:02,771
Nice.

868
01:14:05,858 --> 01:14:08,652
Bo-ram, I bet you didn't know my dream was

869
01:14:09,319 --> 01:14:10,863
to become a basketball player.

870
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,865
You know some moves, Bo-ram.

871
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,255
Why do you move around so much?

872
01:15:10,339 --> 01:15:12,508
Sometimes for work, sometimes for a guy.

873
01:15:12,591 --> 01:15:14,593
And sometimes because of a breakup.

874
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:17,346
She definitely has a husband
on the mainland…

875
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:18,555
Stop spitting on me.

876
01:15:18,639 --> 01:15:21,225
-Let's go to a motel.
-Okay, sure.

877
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:27,231
Captain, do you like me?

878
01:15:27,314 --> 01:15:28,232
Yes.

879
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,192
You're no exception.

880
01:15:30,275 --> 01:15:31,318
Hey! Stop!

881
01:15:31,401 --> 01:15:32,861
Who are you really?

882
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:36,031
Wait. Yeong-ok isn't back yet.

883
01:15:36,114 --> 01:15:38,951
Yeong-ok, resurface!

884
01:15:39,034 --> 01:15:41,578
-You'll get hurt.
-Why are you determined to hurt me?

885
01:15:43,956 --> 01:15:48,877
