OK-DONG AND DONG-SEOK

3
00:00:59,976 --> 00:01:01,019
Looking for something?

4
00:01:04,355 --> 00:01:05,732
How much for 200?

5
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,067
-How many?
-Two hundred.

6
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,276
Two hundred?

7
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:11,237
-Let me look around and come back.
-Okay. See you later.

8
00:01:15,617 --> 00:01:16,785
Hey.

9
00:01:17,368 --> 00:01:19,746
You bought a lot.
Did you make a ton of money?

10
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,706
-Do you need some?
-Yes, I do.

11
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,042
You know my number, right?
Text me your bank account number.

12
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:36,054
Our specialty is doenjang stew.

13
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:40,058
I don't like doenjang stew.
Kimchi stew, please.

14
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:43,603
Who doesn't like doenjang?

15
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:36,489
How would you feel
if I suddenly showed up?

16
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:40,660
Would you only be surprised?
Or would you be happy too?

17
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:41,786
SEON-A

18
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,718
I'd be extremely happy.

Ma'am.

23
00:03:25,538 --> 00:03:26,706
Ms. Kang.

24
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:30,668
Ms. Kang, did you eat breakfast?

25
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:34,047
Jeez. It's cold out.
Why did you leave this open?

26
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:35,965
I'm hot. Keep it open.

27
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:38,092
No, it's cold.

28
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,267
What is all this?

29
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,102
Blankets.

30
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:55,068
In-gwon bought me this last year.
Do you want it?

31
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:56,819
You can use it.

32
00:03:57,695 --> 00:03:59,030
Jeez.

33
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:02,075
Why are you organizing
your blankets all of a sudden?

34
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,292
I made some tasty beef soup for you.

35
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:14,337
Have some broth. I'll reheat it for you.

36
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,299
But who are you calling?

37
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,218
Dong-seok.

38
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,931
We need to go to Mokpo
for his late stepdad's memorial service.

39
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,432
Are you serious?

40
00:04:27,308 --> 00:04:29,269
Do you think he'd…

41
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,567
Is he not picking up?

42
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,864
INCOMING CALL

-It's clean.
-I don't want it.

45
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,153
I'll go heat up the soup.

Hey.

49
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:30,515
Why aren't you picking up your mom's call?

50
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,600
I don't have a mom.

51
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:36,646
Where are you?

52
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:38,981
Come here right now.

53
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,109
I'm in Seoul to buy some goods.

54
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:43,152
I was shopping until early morning.

55
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,116
I'm going to bed.
See you on the market day.

56
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:49,325
Your mom…

57
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:52,537
has cancer.

58
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,832
It's terminal.

59
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,096
So?

60
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,349
What kind of question is that?
Are you serious?

61
00:07:17,854 --> 00:07:19,689
The doctor couldn't do anything.

62
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,316
He gave up on her.

63
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,736
Your mom seemed

64
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,198
to have given up too.

65
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,285
She refused the surgery.

66
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,662
It's too late to do anything now.

67
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,874
Her time is running out.

68
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,419
So come right now.

69
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,963
Don't regret this later.

70
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,468
I'll just regret it later.

Well…

74
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:43,606
I just got off work. I'm outside.

75
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,653

76
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,657
-Hello?
-Mom.

77
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,243
Yeol!

78
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,038
Yeol!

79
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,582
I missed you!

80
00:09:06,337 --> 00:09:08,631
-Did you miss me?
-A ton.

81
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,132
Me too.

82
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:11,926
He's been missing you a lot lately.

83
00:09:12,009 --> 00:09:13,427
It wasn't easy to soothe him.

84
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,722
You must've missed me a lot.

85
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:17,932
I did.

86
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,355
-What should we have tonight?
-Pizza!

87
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,817
We can't have pizza all the time.

88
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,737
No pizza or fried chicken today.
We're having rice.

89
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:33,239
Did you hear your dad?

90
00:09:33,322 --> 00:09:36,409
No pizza. We're having rice for dinner.

91
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:37,535
Okay.

92
00:09:43,207 --> 00:09:45,293
-Hey, watch out.
-I'm sorry.

93
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,003
-It's okay.
-Be careful.

94
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:49,547
-Did he not cough today?
-No.

95
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,724
-Then who's that in that photo?
-He's my ex-boyfriend.

96
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,018
Then why didn't you throw it away?

97
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,729
Because we could get back together.

98
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:06,480
But you've already broken up.

99
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,377
Let's go.

100
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:30,463

to plow the field when he's busy?

You're so weird.

Answer me. Are you dying soon?

She always remains tight-lipped

Add more sesame seeds.

00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,332
Look at you ordering me around.

Try it.

It's tasty. Here.

00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,649
It's too bland.

-Is it?
-Yes.

135
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,238
This much?

136
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,164
-Try it again.
-I'm sure it's fine.

137
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,208
Can I have some?

Ms. Kang, it's cold out. Go inside.

She likes the breeze.

146
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:36,829
Jong-u and Jong-cheol should've prepared
the food for their dad's memorial service.

147
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,957
Why do you have
to prepare everything and go there?

148
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,001
Plus, I'm too busy to go with you.

149
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:47,006
That's enough. We volunteered to help her.
Are you trying to take credit?

150
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:49,216
Don't do it if you're going to complain.

151
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,010
Let me see it again.

152
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:52,761
What?

153
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,305
She can't stop watching it.

154
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,017
She's already watched it
three times in front of us.

155
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,560
Pay me first.

156
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,522
Here.

157
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,234
That's too expensive.

158
00:17:07,317 --> 00:17:08,652
No, it's not.

159
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,456
Grandma! I was right, wasn't I?

160
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,124
Dad's alive.

161
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,710
You were wrong.

162
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:27,004
I was right, wasn't I?

163
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:37,723
Dad asks if it's very windy there.

164
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:46,190
He asks if you're healthy.

165
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:51,028
He says I'm being a good girl
and I even sing well.

166
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:55,365
He wants you to buy me some toys.

167
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:59,411
Mother, the last part was a lie.

168
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,165
Dad drew this on me again.

169
00:18:03,248 --> 00:18:05,501
UNITY

170
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,794
Eun-gi.

171
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:12,257
Sing. Sing for Grandma.

172
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,346
A chick can chirp

173
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,557
A calf cries moo

174
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,642
Are you happy?

175
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,520
-A hunter can shoot…
-You've always been a good mother.

176
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:28,398
You're kindhearted.
That's why you're blessed.

177
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,494
Should I replay the video?
I won't charge you this time.

178
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,750
A chick can chirp…

179
00:19:10,899 --> 00:19:14,278
Hey, why did you ignore my text?

180
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:16,363
Because it wasn't worth my attention.

181
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:18,615
ABANG SUNDAE

182
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:19,867
Follow me.

183
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,413
BANG FAMILY ICE

184
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,355
PUREUNG

185
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:55,402
CLOSED
IN PREPARATION

186
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:11,043
I'm not drinking. I need to drive.

187
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:12,794
Are you serious?

188
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:14,588
Just drink it.

189
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:18,175
I said, no. I don't want to.

190
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:20,969
Just say it. I'm busy.

191
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,347
How can you be busy?

192
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:27,517
Shouldn't tending
to your mom be the priority?

193
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,607
I'll drive your truck.

194
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,275
Why would you do that?

195
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,403
Say what you want to say.

196
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:40,155
Drive your mom to Mokpo.

197
00:20:41,448 --> 00:20:45,577
I was going to take some time off work
and drive her there myself.

198
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:47,162
But she refused.

199
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,792
How can she go there by herself
when she can't even read the signs?

200
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,253
Drive her yourself.

201
00:20:55,504 --> 00:20:57,047
Is that all?

202
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,968
I know how you feel.

203
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:03,470
I know you're mad.

204
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:06,181
Why would he be mad?

205
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:08,725
Why?

206
00:21:09,977 --> 00:21:13,772
Why would he be mad
about his mom fighting cancer?

207
00:21:14,898 --> 00:21:18,193
You should be heartbroken
and worried sick!

208
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,828
Do you not have a heart?
Not even an ounce of conscience?

209
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,540
This is about your mom. She has cancer.

210
00:21:31,623 --> 00:21:35,252
And it's terminal, at that.

211
00:21:35,335 --> 00:21:38,672
You should rush over to her
and ask for her forgiveness.

212
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,215
You should make up for the past.

213
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,926
What are you doing now?

214
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,970
You're being stubborn and not picking up.

215
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,725
Even we get heartbroken and teary-eyed

216
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,852
if we think about
what she has gone through…

217
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,854
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

218
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,649
Just like how you regretted it
after your mom died,

219
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,361
I'm going to do the same after mine dies.

220
00:22:01,945 --> 00:22:03,822
Okay? Can I go now?

221
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,949
How dare you?

222
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:09,328
Damn it. I ought to give you a beating.

223
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:11,079
As if I'll let you.

224
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:12,289
You little…

225
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,666
-Come on.
-Come at me.

226
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:17,044
Why are you taking off your clothes?

227
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:19,796
-We didn't come here to fight!
-Sit down.

228
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:22,924
Jeez, this is infuriating.

229
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:26,803
Dong-seok.

230
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:32,059
Do you think we're doing this
because we don't understand you?

231
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:39,316
After your sister and my friend,
Dong-i, passed away,

232
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,072
your mom remarried
and moved into another man's house

233
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:50,577
less than a month afterward.
And I was truly upset.

234
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,330
I couldn't understand her.

235
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,666
I'm sure you were
much more upset than I was.

236
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:01,213
I never told you this before.

237
00:23:04,257 --> 00:23:05,425
But I cried

238
00:23:06,635 --> 00:23:08,970
day in, day out
because I felt sorry for you.

239
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,225
But Dong-seok.

240
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,353
Your mom…

241
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:21,233
She can't eat anymore.

242
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,318
And she throws up blood.

243
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:27,364
I understand that you're mad.

244
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:32,369
But what can you do, now that she's sick?

245
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,291
Just give in.

246
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,212
Do as she asks. Take her to Mokpo.

247
00:23:43,672 --> 00:23:45,340
And once she passes away,

248
00:23:45,423 --> 00:23:49,344
you can put an end
to your ill-fated relationship.

249
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:53,431
We'll help out with her funeral.

250
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,479
I can't give in.

251
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,190
I won't.

252
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:07,154
I'm not going to Mokpo.

253
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,160
Dong-seok, I empathize with you.

254
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:16,705
I truly understand how you feel.

255
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:20,333
If we don't understand you, then who will?

256
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:24,171
I swear I completely understand you.

257
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:25,839
-But--
-Don't say that.

258
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:31,428
Just say you don't understand me at all.

259
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:35,182
Do you know what I hate hearing the most?

260
00:24:36,057 --> 00:24:37,851
Hearing that people understand me.

261
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:40,520
You know nothing.

262
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:43,690
Have you ever seen your mom

263
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:47,903
and your dad's friend,
who's also your friend's dad,

264
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,366
go into the same bedroom together,

265
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:54,910
turn off the lights,

266
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:58,705
and sleep together?

267
00:25:04,377 --> 00:25:07,047
No, you haven't.
So what do you understand?

268
00:25:08,298 --> 00:25:10,008
Yeong-ok, give us bigger glasses.

269
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:15,263
Do you know why
I've never considered getting married

270
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:17,140
to the women I dated so far?

271
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:18,183
My mom…

272
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:23,605
I mean, because I was afraid that
they'd turn out to be like Ms. Kang.

273
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,733
It doesn't matter how great they are.

274
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:30,820
I feel disgusted if they resemble
my mom even in the slightest.

275
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:34,616
You don't know what she did to me.

276
00:25:56,388 --> 00:25:58,848
You understand me? No, you don't.

277
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:02,560
You don't fucking know anything.
You're just pissing me off.

278
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:23,206
There must be something between them
that we're not aware of.

279
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:27,335
You've done enough. You should let it go.

280
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:30,839
All right.

281
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,468
Eun-hui.

282
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:39,014
Let's give up.

283
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:41,016
It's not our business.

284
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:43,977
Let's just drink.

285
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,367
Shouldn't we be picking members
for the athletic meet next month?

286
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,121
Shut up.

287
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,374
Okay.

288
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,185
Dong-seok.

289
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,148
Let's drive along the coastal road.

290
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:35,004
I just learned that my mom
who I despise has cancer.

291
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,300
And I feel weird.

292
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,471
I'm neither sad…

293
00:28:45,432 --> 00:28:47,058
nor jumping

294
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,811
for joy.

295
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,860
The anger is slowly creeping up on me.

296
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:00,029
I feel like shit.

297
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,748
Let's go.

298
00:29:35,231 --> 00:29:36,399
Bye.

299
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:58,797
Go home.

300
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:00,882
Okay.

301
00:30:11,851 --> 00:30:13,561
SEON-A

302
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,074
Hey, it's me.

303
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,577
You finally picked up.

304
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,249
I was worried you wouldn't pick up again.

305
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:38,211
Dong-seok.

306
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,047
My mom has cancer.

307
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,175
It's terminal.

308
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:48,805
But I'm fine.

309
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,809
Part of me thinks
that it's finally over between us.

310
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,646
I feel relieved too.

311
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:01,359
But she wants me

312
00:31:02,652 --> 00:31:03,987
to go to my stepfather's…

313
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:07,615
She wants me to attend
her second husband's memorial service.

314
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:13,663
She knows I'd obviously hate it.
It's as if she's picking a fight with me.

315
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,665
Must I go?

316
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:22,839
I'm not sure.

317
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:25,383
My friends all say that I should.

318
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:29,429
They said I'd be a heartless bastard

319
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:31,848
if I didn't grant her dying wish.

320
00:31:33,182 --> 00:31:34,726
But I don't want to go.

321
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,107
Then don't.

322
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,529
My father died while sailing.

323
00:31:50,283 --> 00:31:53,870
Then my sister died
three years later while harvesting.

324
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,333
My mom was all I had.

325
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:03,171
Do you know what the first thing
she said to me was

326
00:32:05,381 --> 00:32:07,258
before moving in with her second husband?

327
00:32:12,013 --> 00:32:13,389
"I'm no longer

328
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:17,769
your mom. I'll be your aunt."

329
00:32:20,063 --> 00:32:22,023
"Jong-u and Jong-cheol's mom
is your new mom."

330
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,484
So I said,

331
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,653
"No."

332
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,072
"You're my mom."

333
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,616
"Why would I call

334
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,494
their mom mine?"

335
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,372
After I said that,

336
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:43,461
she stared at me for a while.

337
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:48,132
Then she slapped me.

338
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:51,094
Not once or twice. But dozens of times.

339
00:32:51,844 --> 00:32:53,638
Until my mouth started to bleed.

340
00:32:55,264 --> 00:32:57,892
She slapped her own son
who was weaker than others.

341
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,227
She beat me.

342
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:06,943
And from that day on,
I was a very obedient kid.

343
00:33:09,862 --> 00:33:11,614
I didn't call her Mom anymore.

344
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:16,619
Even to this day,
I treat her like an aunt.

345
00:33:22,166 --> 00:33:24,252
I never told about this to anyone before.

346
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,048
Had you been by my side,

347
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,718
I would've hugged you.

348
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,517
One time,

349
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:44,397
I stole money and valuables
from their house and said this to her.

350
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:48,234
"Let's go to Seoul together.
Let's get out of here."

351
00:33:50,278 --> 00:33:54,782
"This is compensation for getting beaten
by Jong-u and Jong-cheol."

352
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:58,703
"So don't feel bad.
I'm not doing anything wrong."

353
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:00,580
"Let's just get out of here."

354
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:04,417
She looked at me for a while.
And do you know what she said?

355
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:09,338
She didn't cry or beg me to stay.

356
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:13,509
She didn't even hold me back.
She just said one thing.

357
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,307
"You filthy thief."

358
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,540
Do you feel sorry

359
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,460
for getting a divorce as a mom?

360
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:50,338
Of course, I do.

361
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,841
Because he was

362
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:58,596
a kid that got hurt because of us.

363
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,558
Then why is my mom
always so brazen in front of me?

364
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,562
How could she be so shameless,

365
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,315
telling me to drive her to Mokpo?

366
00:35:10,191 --> 00:35:12,235
It wasn't a request. It was a demand.

367
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:14,987
So must I go?

368
00:35:15,863 --> 00:35:17,615
Would I be a bastard if I didn't?

369
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:22,787
-Do whatever your heart says.
-What my heart says?

370
00:35:22,870 --> 00:35:25,331
In that case, I wouldn't be here.

371
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,041
I'd confront her this instant.

372
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:29,919
I'd say, "Why are you doing this to me?"

373
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,840
"Does having cancer make you entitled?
Does that give you the right

374
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,633
to treat me like this?"

375
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:38,719
"How could you be brazen enough

376
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:42,890
to demand me to take you to Mokpo?"

377
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,777
When I was getting beaten up
by Jong-u and Jong-cheol,

378
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:59,115
she just stayed still
and watched without batting an eye.

379
00:36:01,117 --> 00:36:04,537
She has never treated me like a son.

380
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:07,707
So how can she expect me
to be a good son after all this damn time?

381
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:11,794
If I could do it my way,

382
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,798
I'd explode at her face.

383
00:36:18,551 --> 00:36:22,430
I don't think that's a bad idea either.

384
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,769
Even to this day,

385
00:36:30,062 --> 00:36:31,647
I want to confront my dad

386
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:34,275
if I could.

387
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,113
I just don't get
how he could commit suicide

388
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:40,865
in front of his own daughter.

389
00:36:42,408 --> 00:36:46,495
I want to ask
if I really meant nothing to him.

390
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,833
But I can't do that

391
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,045
even though I want to.

392
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:00,551
Don't be like me.

393
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:04,555
Ask her while you still can.

394
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:06,390
Confront her while you can.

395
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,560
"Have you ever felt sorry for me?"

396
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:12,313
"Have you ever loved me?"

397
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:16,984
"Why didn't you protect me when I was
getting beaten?" Ask her everything.

398
00:37:18,694 --> 00:37:21,948
Ask her all the questions
you've been having in your head.

399
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,583
About that bastard…

400
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,921
Are you seeing Yeol's dad again?

401
00:37:41,217 --> 00:37:42,343
No.

402
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,971
I'm not.

403
00:37:46,847 --> 00:37:48,724
That day when you visited Seoul,

404
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,270
Tae-hun was there solely for Yeol.

405
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:57,733
I don't have feelings for him.

406
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:01,237
But I do for you.

407
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,205
Thank you for asking.

408
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:14,583
If you didn't,

409
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,420
I was going to tell you myself.

410
00:38:27,388 --> 00:38:28,639
Are you really…

411
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,685
coming to visit me?

412
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,107
I was going to go this weekend.

413
00:38:39,066 --> 00:38:42,987
But my mom's coming,
so I'm taking a day off next week.

414
00:38:49,035 --> 00:38:50,286
Will you spend the night?

415
00:38:53,289 --> 00:38:54,540
I'm planning to.

416
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:06,093
See you then.

417
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,472
And about your mom?

418
00:39:10,514 --> 00:39:12,475
I'm hanging up. Good night.

419
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,675
Mom!

420
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:49,720
Mom! Let's go home!

421
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,806
Let's go home!

422
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,141
Let's not go to Jong-u and Jong-cheol's.

423
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:55,643
Let's go back home.

424
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,937
I'll do better!

425
00:39:58,020 --> 00:40:00,147
I'll go to the mainland and make money!

426
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:03,067
I'll take care of you!

427
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:04,527
So let's just go home!

428
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,863
Mom…

429
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,032
-Mom…
-Fine. Let's see what she has to say.

430
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:13,536
I'll ask her about everything.

431
00:40:15,287 --> 00:40:16,705
About why she did that.

432
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:20,918
About how she could sleep

433
00:40:22,044 --> 00:40:24,088
with another man
while her son was outside.

434
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:26,465
Whether she was excited.

435
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,221
About how she truly felt

436
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,892
when watching me get beaten up
by Jong-u and Jong-cheol.

437
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:43,774
About why she hit me
when I called her "Mom".

438
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,328
I'm going to ask her everything.

439
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,086
Have some sundae soup.

440
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:06,714
-Have some.
-Have some sundae soup.

441
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,299
Hello.

442
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,843
-Have some.
-Hello.

443
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,386
-Hello.
-Hello.

444
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,679
Do you just have one?

445
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:15,806
Hello.

446
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:18,017
We have fresh cuttlefish. Two kilograms.

447
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:19,143
It's fresh.

448
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,478
We have hairtail and squid.

449
00:41:20,561 --> 00:41:22,646
-Hello.
-Come take a look.

450
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:24,815
-Can you give it for cheap?
-No, I can't.

451
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,779
Here.

452
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,493
Give Dong-seok a cup of coffee.

453
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:38,120
Give Dong-seok a cup of coffee.

454
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:43,959
Give him a cup of coffee.

455
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:48,422
Dong-seok!

456
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:50,466
Dong-seok!

457
00:41:51,509 --> 00:41:52,968
Come here.

458
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:14,949
Have some coffee.

459
00:42:15,991 --> 00:42:17,701
It's your mom's treat.

460
00:42:29,213 --> 00:42:31,298
Go on. Why aren't you drinking it?

461
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:49,024
Hey, isn't it hot?

462
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:10,879
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

463
00:43:13,048 --> 00:43:14,300
Hello.

464
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,149
What do you want?

465
00:43:31,358 --> 00:43:33,235
You only have sundae soup.

466
00:43:33,819 --> 00:43:36,614
What nonsense are you spewing?

467
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,116
Sundae, boiled pork,
sundae soup, and sundae noodles.

468
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:40,576
We have a variety.

469
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:42,745
Give me sundae soup.

470
00:43:47,166 --> 00:43:49,043
Have you quit school for good?

471
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:50,878
I'm going to take the GED later.

472
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:56,425
A guy like Hyeon deserves respect.

473
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:00,721
He treats his wife like a queen
and works to provide for their baby.

474
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:04,224
He also comes here to help his dad out.

475
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:08,312
He even works at a restaurant downtown.
He's much better than you.

476
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:09,688
I didn't say anything.

477
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,942
When is Yeong-ju due?

478
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,402
Next month.

479
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,241
Are you excited to be a dad?

480
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:22,993
I am.

481
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:44,306
Are you ignoring me now?

482
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:51,063
We were never that close, to begin with.

483
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:59,905
Is that so? How about you?

484
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,283
Just eat.

485
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,633
When is the memorial service?

486
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:32,604
It's tomorrow evening.

487
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:38,861
Then you'll have to board
the afternoon ship.

488
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:42,614
Are you coming too?

489
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,833
She's asking you a question.

490
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:55,878
Hey, he only asked
because he was going to go.

491
00:45:55,961 --> 00:45:59,381
If not, why would he have asked? Right?

492
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,513
Were you starving to death or something?

493
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:10,142
Stop stuffing your face
and answer her question.

494
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:13,687
If you're going to go, just tell her so.

495
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,814
Are you trying
to sound her out or something?

496
00:46:15,898 --> 00:46:17,733
Why did you stop talking midway?

497
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:20,777
Then can we take the evening flight?

498
00:46:21,445 --> 00:46:22,863
Of course, you can.

499
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:25,115
Ms. Kang, take the plane this time.

500
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:27,701
Don't take the ship. It'll take too long.

501
00:46:27,784 --> 00:46:31,538
She's never been on a plane before.
Board a ship.

502
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,123
Take the one at 2 p.m.

503
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:34,708
Let's board the morning ship.

504
00:46:38,086 --> 00:46:40,130
But the memorial service
is in the evening.

505
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:43,884
Take your time and leave after lunchtime.

506
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:45,844
Why take her time if she's going anyway?

507
00:46:46,887 --> 00:46:48,764
Pick her up at 4 a.m.

508
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:56,355
I'll pay for everyone.

509
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:03,278
I'll be at your place by 4 a.m.

510
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:07,574
Hey! Look at you!

511
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,993
-I'm so proud of you!
-Stop it.

512
00:47:10,077 --> 00:47:12,621
You little brat.
Don't you know how much I adore you?

513
00:47:12,704 --> 00:47:14,498
Look at you! You brat!

514
00:47:14,581 --> 00:47:15,791
Well done!

515
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:21,964
Look at that.

516
00:47:22,047 --> 00:47:26,134
Your wish came true.
You'll be going there together.

517
00:47:26,677 --> 00:47:29,680
He finally gave in
after hearing that his mom was sick.

518
00:47:30,264 --> 00:47:31,431
That little brat.

519
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:34,685
Can I have more broth?

520
00:47:34,768 --> 00:47:40,065
Thank goodness!
That's the best thing I heard today!

521
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,067
You'll get better if you eat well.

522
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,486
Eating well cures all illnesses.

523
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,697
Here. Goodness.

524
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,337
Good thinking, Ok-dong. Eat up.

525
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:06,383
You need the energy
to go to Mokpo with Dong-seok.

526
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,135
Okay.

527
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,308
Where are you going?

528
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:18,061
Yeong-ju was carried
to the hospital from school!

529
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,897
What do you mean? Isn't it too soon?

530
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:22,107
She's due next month!

531
00:48:22,816 --> 00:48:25,777
Hey, stop talking and just run! Wait up!

532
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,945
What?

533
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,238
Move!

534
00:48:30,907 --> 00:48:34,077
ABANG SUNDAE

535
00:48:49,384 --> 00:48:52,304
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

536
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,656
Hey.

537
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,964
What happened?

538
00:49:29,091 --> 00:49:31,677
Tell me. What is it?

539
00:49:35,055 --> 00:49:37,015
What happened, Ho-sik?

540
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:41,186
Yeong-ju is in a lot of pain.

541
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:46,316
She's been having contractions
for over ten hours now.

542
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:49,820
What…

543
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:54,783
She's just…

544
00:49:55,617 --> 00:49:57,035
having contractions.

545
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,120
Right?

546
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:01,331
That's all, right?

547
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:08,255
Yeong-ju is still healthy and well, right?

548
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,676
Come on!

549
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:14,970
You almost gave me
a heart attack! Seriously!

550
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,306
I thought something had happened to her!

551
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:20,475
I almost fainted!

552
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,145
My legs…

553
00:50:23,228 --> 00:50:25,313
My legs gave out.

554
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,486
She'll be okay, right?

555
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,364
I hope so.

556
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,993
Hey. Jeez.

557
00:50:55,594 --> 00:50:57,220
Are you having contractions again?

558
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,147
It's almost at three-minute intervals now.

559
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,274
Just hang in…

560
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:17,491
Yeong-ju.

561
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:20,911
Do you want to get
a C-section if it's too painful?

562
00:51:30,879 --> 00:51:32,881
Let's just get a C-section. Please?

563
00:51:33,965 --> 00:51:35,884
You're in too much pain.

564
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:39,554
Let's just get a C-section.

565
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:42,849
Let me check.

566
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:49,147
Please put your legs down.

567
00:51:59,199 --> 00:52:01,743
The baby will come out soon.

568
00:52:01,827 --> 00:52:03,829
Please take her to the delivery room!

569
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,711
Please take good care of her.

570
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:15,131
I beg you.
Please take good care of Yeong-ju!

571
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:21,179
Hey.

572
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:23,431
Yeong-ju…

573
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,476
Yeong-ju.

574
00:52:34,401 --> 00:52:36,319
Please wait here.

575
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:38,989
RESTRICTED ACCESS

576
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:44,244
Will Ms. Bang's guardian come inside?

577
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,453
Come here.

578
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:29,789
A, B, C, D

579
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:32,834
"A."

580
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,548
"B."

581
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,469
"C."

582
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,221
Let's go.

583
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,432
Let's go.

584
00:54:32,227 --> 00:54:33,478
Aren't you coming?

585
00:54:38,024 --> 00:54:39,234
It's me, Dong-seok.

586
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,445
Are you not there?

587
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:45,907
Jeez.

588
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:48,576
-Let's go.
-Give me a minute.

589
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:01,965
I thought we were going.

590
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:05,301
Give me a minute.
The toilet was too dirty.

591
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,223
Are you serious?

592
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,103
Who am I?
Jong-u, Jong-cheol, or Dong-seok?

593
00:55:17,564 --> 00:55:18,982
You have no time to clean.

594
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,026
You don't have dementia, right?

595
00:55:23,486 --> 00:55:26,031
Throw away the bundles inside the house.

596
00:55:27,490 --> 00:55:28,867
Put them in the backyard.

597
00:55:30,118 --> 00:55:34,831
Leave them there,
and Eun-hui will take care of them.

598
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,792
What are you doing? Getting ready to die?

599
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,211
There's not much to throw out anyway.

600
00:55:41,337 --> 00:55:43,548
The others will take care
of everything anyway.

601
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:46,593
Or give them to Ms. Hyeon.

602
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:49,512
Who would want to use

603
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:52,265
anything that was mine once I die?

604
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,061
Jeez.

605
00:57:29,195 --> 00:57:30,488
Come on.

606
00:57:38,872 --> 00:57:39,998
Jeez.

607
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,721
What is she doing?

608
00:58:16,701 --> 00:58:19,454
Bring the bundles
that are on the wooden bench.

609
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:24,042
Jong-cheol loves seasoned dried radish
and bracken. Bring them.

610
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,581
Put them in the back.

611
00:59:03,665 --> 00:59:06,042
Chun-hui will be coming too.

612
00:59:07,252 --> 00:59:08,878
She's going to visit Man-su.

613
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:25,853
Close the door.

614
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:28,898
Do it yourself. I'm too weak.

615
01:00:03,349 --> 01:00:05,893
Where are we off to? Ms. Hyeon's?

616
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,698
EUNHUI'S FISH MARKET

617
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,036
There's one more.

618
01:00:23,661 --> 01:00:26,748
It has a yellow string around it.
It's dried tilefish.

619
01:00:26,831 --> 01:00:29,208
You should've told me sooner to save time.

620
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:31,919
Can we just go without it?
We need to board soon.

621
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,922
-Bring it.
-Bring it.

622
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:53,608
There's one more.

623
01:00:54,692 --> 01:00:57,028
You should've said they were two
in the first place.

624
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:02,158
Unbelievable.

625
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,814
Coffee.

626
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:19,569
Let's have breakfast first.

627
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:58,191
She's smiling at a dog?

628
01:02:58,274 --> 01:02:59,400
If you're nervous…

629
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,362
I'm pretty sure
your parents won't like me.

630
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:06,365
Do everything you want.

631
01:03:07,408 --> 01:03:08,409
Take it.

632
01:03:09,452 --> 01:03:10,369
Then brace yourself.

633
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,289
I'm attending your dad's memorial service.

634
01:03:13,372 --> 01:03:14,749
Don't you know
why he died of pent-up anger?

635
01:03:14,832 --> 01:03:16,459
What are you being sorry for?

636
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:19,253
-Doenjang, your favorite.
-I don't eat it anymore.

637
01:03:21,422 --> 01:03:24,342
Despite not doing
anything wrong to anyone,

638
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,302
you always act like you did.

639
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:27,595
How are you not sorry to me?

640
01:03:28,930 --> 01:03:30,014
Mom.

641
01:03:38,564 --> 01:03:43,569
