1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:29,112
YEONG-JU AND HYEON

2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,700
THINKING OF YOU (FEAT. IN-GWON, HO-SIK),
ROMEO AND JULIET, DAWN, WHAT IS LOVE?

3
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,750
Good morning, Ms. Kang.

4
00:01:39,432 --> 00:01:41,059
-There we go.
-Goodness.

5
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,396
It's about four days old,
but it tastes the same.

6
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:47,941
If not for you, it'd be in the trash.

7
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,442
-I'll be off.
-Okay.

8
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,239
You'll be blessed.

9
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:57,367
Goodness, you say that to me all the time.

10
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:00,578
You'd better bless me!
Don't make me upset!

11
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:02,705
Hyeon will do well in life.

12
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:06,626
Of course. He'd better not become a thug
and end up chopping sundae like me.

13
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,419
I'm off now.

14
00:02:20,557 --> 00:02:23,101
Look who's here. Wait.

15
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:24,978
Hold on.

16
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,271
Just a second.

17
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:29,566
Hey, come here. Eat this.

18
00:02:29,649 --> 00:02:33,194
Here you go.

19
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:41,119
PUREUNG BUS STOP

20
00:02:59,387 --> 00:03:02,181
Nostalgic rice crackers.

21
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:05,435
Nickel-silver pots.

22
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,563
Stainless steel pots.

23
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:12,108
Frying pans.

24
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:16,487
Pliers, hammers, and screwdrivers.
All kinds of tools.

25
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:20,450
Pliers, hammers, and screwdrivers.
All kinds of tools.

26
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:23,286
Tops and shorts.

27
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:25,830
Tops and shorts.

28
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:39,969
Pass me the wrench.

29
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:08,122
INCOMING CALL

30
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:17,131
What is it?

31
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,683
What? What is it?

32
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:31,104
Aren't you going to say anything?

33
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,110
Did you eat?

34
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,737
Did I eat?

35
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:43,908
Did I eat?

36
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,412
Why do you suddenly want to know that?

37
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:52,083
Whether or not I had eaten
was the last thing you ever cared about.

38
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,751
Are you senile?

39
00:04:55,461 --> 00:04:56,671
Did you dial the wrong number?

40
00:05:00,258 --> 00:05:01,175
Momâ€¦

41
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,097
I mean, Aunt. Did you mean to call
the two other sons that you adore so much?

42
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:07,890
This is Dong-seok.

43
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,976
I'm not Jong-cheol or Jong-u.

44
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:14,564
Ms. Kang Ok-dong.

45
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,234
DOCTOR'S OFFICE

46
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,485
Come on inside.

47
00:05:26,617 --> 00:05:27,618
Hello?

48
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,203
Hello?

49
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:32,290
Damn it. This is so annoying.

50
00:05:32,373 --> 00:05:33,541
Damn it.

51
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:37,795
Dong-seok, here.

52
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,008
You buy things from someone else,

53
00:05:42,091 --> 00:05:43,926
but you bring this to me?

54
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,304
I'll talk to you later.
Let me finish this first.

55
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,805
Let's talk later.

56
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,687
I'm sorry.

57
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,483
I won't ever buy things
from another truck again.

58
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:00,693
We're sorry, Dong-seok.

59
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:03,571
-Let it go.
-Come on. Be nice.

60
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,531
-Forgive her.
-Unbelievable.

61
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,868
I'm always the bad guy, aren't I?

62
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:10,703
Water.

63
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:13,081
Okay, here's your water.

64
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:15,917
Have some water and cut her some slack.

65
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:18,836
Goodness.

66
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,383
Ms. Kang, I told you
to come with your son.

67
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,760
Why did you come alone?

68
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:30,681
The cancer has spread a lot more
compared to when you last came.

69
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:33,142
From your stomach to your lungs and liver.

70
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:38,314
At least consider getting chemotherapy.

71
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:42,401
Get yourself hospitalized today
and receive an injection.

72
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:45,488
Ms. Kang.

73
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:49,492
At this rate, things can get really bad
in just a month or two.

74
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:50,743
Please, ma'am.

75
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,747
Just prescribe me something
for my digestion.

76
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,210
YEONG-JU AND HYEON

77
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:52,054
Sometimes, when I feel suffocated
living on this island,

78
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,431
I run all the way here.

79
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:57,185
Because this is the very end of Jeju.

80
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:03,983
Jeju is surrounded by the sea.

81
00:08:05,193 --> 00:08:07,195
I'm given no other choice but to stop

82
00:08:07,278 --> 00:08:10,114
once I realize that
this is the farthest I can go.

83
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,330
Gosh, it stinks of fish.

84
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,042
Damn it!

85
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:24,921
That damn seagull.

86
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,547
Damn you!

87
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,385
Damn it, it stinks.

88
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:42,146
I really don't get why people
from the mainland

89
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:44,482
always come here
to see this lame, same old sea.

90
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:47,527
Seoul is much more fun.

91
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,154
What's so great about
this dull countryside?

92
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,283
That it's free from pollution? Clean?

93
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,787
So damn boring.

94
00:09:00,081 --> 00:09:02,083
I want to contaminate this entire island.

95
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,293
Hello.

96
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,128
Hello.

97
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:09,173
Hello.

98
00:09:09,257 --> 00:09:10,383
Hello.

99
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:12,468
-Yeong-ju, did you eat?
-Yes.

100
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:14,804
Hello.

101
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:17,265
-Hello.
-Hi.

102
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:18,182
Hi.

103
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,101
Hello.

104
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:22,311
-Hello.
-Hey.

105
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:23,980
Isn't that Ho-sik's daughter?

106
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,149
She's still the top student in her year.

107
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:30,695
She grew up without a mother,
but she turned out just fine.

108
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:33,364
-She doesn't have a mother?
-Hello.

109
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:35,783
She ran away when Yeong-ju was a baby.

110
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:38,703
There's not a single person
who doesn't know me here.

111
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:40,997
-I want to run away.
-Hello.

112
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:44,166
-I spend all day saying hello to people.
-Hello.

113
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,293
I'm so sick of this.

114
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:46,919
Hello.

115
00:09:48,379 --> 00:09:50,923
-Here are your coffees.
-Thanks.

116
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,138
Just give me some sweet potatoes later.

117
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,435
-She's so kind.
-She is.

118
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:11,694
My dad told me to buy seaweed
and sweet potatoes from you.

119
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:12,778
Okay.

120
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:16,824
When did you grow so big?

121
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,286
We met at the market last time.
I can't grow in just five days.

122
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:22,496
Of course, you can.

123
00:10:23,497 --> 00:10:24,707
Here you go.

124
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,626
Just give me 5,000 won for everything.

125
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:31,213
She used to cry so much
when she was a baby.

126
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:34,175
I often took care of you
when Ho-sik was busy.

127
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,012
I was pretty much your mother.

128
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,472
If you put it that way,

129
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:42,933
that makes everyone
in this market her parent.

130
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,602
Stop trying to take credit.

131
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:47,647
My point exactly.
I'm sick of hearing people say that.

132
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:52,568
Thanks.

133
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:56,947
1,000 WON

134
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,534
Go on. Go.

135
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:04,705
These two ladies are the only people
who truly understand me.

136
00:11:10,336 --> 00:11:12,546
-Your dried fish is here.
-Hey.

137
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:15,341
I can see your ass. Pull down your pants.

138
00:11:15,424 --> 00:11:17,093
If I do, you'll see my underwear.

139
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:19,804
Stop acting like my mom
and get married already.

140
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,555
That darn brat.

141
00:11:21,639 --> 00:11:24,308
You'd better dress properly,
or I'll give you a beating.

142
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:28,437
Why did you call me today?

143
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,818
Why can't you be more friendly
when you greet your mother?

144
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,945
Why would you talk to her that way?

145
00:11:36,028 --> 00:11:38,239
You talk like a loan shark
who's here to collect.

146
00:11:38,322 --> 00:11:39,323
What's wrong with you?

147
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:40,991
I'm asking why you called.

148
00:11:43,494 --> 00:11:44,870
No reason.

149
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:54,213
"No reason"?

150
00:11:55,714 --> 00:11:56,841
"No reason"?

151
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,762
Were we ever close enough
to call each other for no reason?

152
00:12:02,346 --> 00:12:03,389
Ms. Kang Ok-dong.

153
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,434
Do you really think we're that close?

154
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,561
Goodness, Dong-seok.

155
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,604
Don't speak to your mother like that.

156
00:12:10,688 --> 00:12:11,689
Hey.

157
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:15,192
So your mother called you.
Why is that such a big problem?

158
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,194
Stop glaring at your mother like that.

159
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,612
Don't call me, okay?

160
00:12:19,488 --> 00:12:21,615
Why would you call me for no reason?

161
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,618
Since when were we that close?

162
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,287
We're not close.

163
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,040
I'll make sure to hold your funeral

164
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,918
when you die, Aunt.

165
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:35,171
You can call me then.

166
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:38,466
How can your mother call you
after she passes?

167
00:12:38,549 --> 00:12:40,217
-You lunatic.
-Answer me.

168
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,887
Don't ever call me again.

169
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:46,056
Don't call me and get me all worked up.

170
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,642
All right?

171
00:12:49,768 --> 00:12:52,146
-Hey. That's enough. Let's go.
-Okay?

172
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:54,690
-All right?
-Come on. Let's go already, you punk.

173
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:58,402
-Gosh. Just go.
-That damn boy.

174
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,490
The coffee is sweet.

175
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,330
It's sweet.

176
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:17,588
-Let go of me.
-Gosh, get over here.

177
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:19,256
What's your problem?

178
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:23,219
You really need to stop being like this.

179
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,931
Your mother's almost 80 years old.

180
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,601
What did she do to upset you so much?

181
00:13:30,684 --> 00:13:32,561
When my dad passed away,

182
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:35,356
my mom drank all the time,
broke everything she saw at home,

183
00:13:35,439 --> 00:13:37,358
and eventually died of heatstroke

184
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,652
because she did farm work
while she was drunk.

185
00:13:39,735 --> 00:13:41,362
But I never once hated her.

186
00:13:41,946 --> 00:13:44,990
Good for you,
but I'm an ungrateful bastard.

187
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,535
I'm a damn bastard who has no parents.

188
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,621
That's why I make
my innocent aunt's life--

189
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,623
-You mean, your mother.
-My aunt!

190
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,085
That's why I always
make her life so miserable, okay?

191
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:00,172
Listen, you punk. I'm trying to tell you--

192
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:02,174
Of all the men she could marryâ€¦

193
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:04,593
She could have gone for so many other men.

194
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:08,264
But she just had to choose the father
of the guy I hated the most.

195
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:10,808
What's worse is that
he used to be Dad's friend.

196
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,269
How much is this?

197
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:16,564
How about this?

198
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:20,192
Damn it.

199
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:27,575
That punk will learn his lesson
once his mother passes away.

200
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,914
-Hello.
-A carton of eggs, please.

201
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:35,207
-This one?
-Yes.

202
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,088
-Goodbye.
-Hey!

203
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:44,633
Do you still smoke?

204
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,970
Do you? Unbelievable.
Her dad is Ho-sik, the ice seller.

205
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:49,471
Goodness me.

206
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,974
I caught her smoking
when she was in middle school,

207
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,977
and her dad cried his eyes out
and threw a fit.

208
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,440
Look at her. That impudent punk.

209
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:10,034
The only thing that isn't boring
in this countryside is Hyeon.

210
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,661
He doesn't dress well
and seems like a nerd,

211
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,580
but he's different when he's with me.

212
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:18,918
He's the only person
that excites me on this boring island.

213
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:21,420
Butâ€¦

214
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,841
I think I let that excitement
go a bit too far.

215
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:33,182
ABANG SUNDAE

216
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,439
We're short on living expenses.

217
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,691
Can I have an extra 50,000 won?

218
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:46,028
Do you take money for yourself
from our living expenses?

219
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,197
Why do you keep asking me for money?

220
00:15:48,989 --> 00:15:50,699
Take it from the money jar.

221
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:15,474
Hey.

222
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,810
Say hello.

223
00:16:17,893 --> 00:16:22,064
His uncle's son was the chief secretary
of a former congressperson.

224
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,524
He's not my uncle.

225
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,442
He's my wife's uncle.

226
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,987
-Stop it. You're embarrassing me.
-He's my son.

227
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,738
He's the top student in his year.

228
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:33,325
Yeong-ju's the top student.

229
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,119
I come in second, third, or fifth.

230
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,204
Good for you, you punk.

231
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,665
He often gets the best grades.

232
00:16:39,748 --> 00:16:41,000
He's just humble.

233
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:42,626
He wants to study medicine
at Seoul National University.

234
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,794
Can I go?

235
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:46,088
I want him to go to law school,
but he won't listen to me.

236
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:48,716
In-gwon, you must be proud of him.

237
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:51,468
That's what you think.
In order to pay for his tuition,

238
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,138
I'll have to sell sundae soup
for ten more years.

239
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:57,683
Have some sundae soup.

240
00:16:57,766 --> 00:16:59,393
I'll be late for school.

241
00:16:59,476 --> 00:17:02,271
It's early. You won't be late
just because you eat this.

242
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:05,816
What's wrong? Is it because it smells?

243
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:09,069
You punk, this smelly sundae
helped me make money to raise you.

244
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,405
Yet you look down on my job.

245
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:14,491
Hey, In-gwon. How have you been?

246
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,370
Are you still living your life as a thug?

247
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,708
Don't say hello to him!

248
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:26,712
This is my son,
the top student in his year.

249
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,713
Go on now.

250
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:35,429
You got yourself a smart son.

251
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:38,182
No wonder you're so proud, In-gwon.

252
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,976
Wipe that smile off your face,
you damn thug.

253
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,380
It's steaming hot.

254
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,349
Gosh, it's burnt.

255
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,814
My gosh.

256
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,777
Hey, sea.

257
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:34,488
You just wait.

258
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:37,032
Just wait one more year.

259
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,911
I'll be free
once Yeong-ju leaves for college.

260
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,165
Then I'll get on a boat
and go fishing out in the sea.

261
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:52,089
My hometown is by the southern sea

262
00:18:52,673 --> 00:18:58,512
I still remember the clear blue water

263
00:18:58,595 --> 00:19:03,934
I will never forget

264
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:09,481
The calm sea by my hometown

265
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:16,405
I picture the waterfowl
Flying above the sea

266
00:19:16,488 --> 00:19:19,825
I miss my hometown

267
00:19:19,908 --> 00:19:22,536
I miss it so much

268
00:19:22,619 --> 00:19:24,663
Throw away that sock. It has a hole in it.

269
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,085
I will once you leave for college.

270
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,630
Did you buy what I asked
from Ms. Kang and Ms. Hyeon?

271
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:34,756
Yes.

272
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,676
Good job.

273
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:43,390
Can I give you a peck on the cheek?

274
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:49,855
That adorable brat.

275
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:52,900
That cute brat.

276
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,152
That precious brat.

277
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,280
You're doing it again.

278
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,241
Stop opening the door
right after you knock.

279
00:20:02,326 --> 00:20:05,913
Mackerel or Spanish mackerel? Choose.
I need to cook and head to the market.

280
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,124
I don't care. They're both fish.

281
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,544
Will you stop using so much toothpaste?

282
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:16,924
What did I just tell you? Hey!

283
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,759
You never listen, do you?

284
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,013
Learn to be more frugal.

285
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,846
EASY CHECK ONE
QUICK AND EASY PREGNANCY TEST KIT

286
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,338
I've had enough of Jeju,

287
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:41,216
and I was ready to leave
the moment I turned 20.

288
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,137
But it looks like I might get tied down.

289
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,808
BANG YEONG-JU

290
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,936
You guys are hilarious.

291
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,356
My gosh.

292
00:21:57,649 --> 00:22:00,235
Stop it guys. You're going to make me pee.

293
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:02,571
Seriously.

294
00:22:10,746 --> 00:22:13,332
Hey. Can we talk?

295
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:14,583
Get lost.

296
00:22:22,883 --> 00:22:24,426
You didn't teach me all the moves.

297
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:25,594
-I'm lost.
-Just dance.

298
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,679
Gosh, I'm exhausted.

299
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,766
-Why are your boobs so big?
-Don't touch me.

300
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,895
Why are you so cranky?
You can touch mine too.

301
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:36,271
Did you gain weight?

302
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,690
Let's go to a coin karaoke today.

303
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,692
No, thanks. I need to study.

304
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,778
Come on. Show some loyalty.

305
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:44,988
She's always like this.

306
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:46,364
She joins when she wants to have fun

307
00:22:46,448 --> 00:22:49,201
but draws a line when she needs to study.
You cold brat.

308
00:22:49,284 --> 00:22:51,286
Did you hear that? She's right, you know.

309
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,672
-Hey.
-Yes?

310
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,549
-Do you have money?
-Yes, I do.

311
00:23:04,633 --> 00:23:06,843
Can I borrow some?
I'll pay you back once I get my allowance.

312
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:08,428
Gosh.

313
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:12,182
Here. Don't bother paying me back.

314
00:23:14,351 --> 00:23:16,228
The bell's ringing.

315
00:23:17,395 --> 00:23:18,730
The bell's ringing.

316
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,695
Quiet, guys. It's time for class.

317
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:41,628
Sit down, everyone.

318
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:45,507
Attention.

319
00:23:46,633 --> 00:23:47,968
Let's greet our teacher.

320
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:49,928
-We love you.
-We love you.

321
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,014
Come on, sir.

322
00:24:02,524 --> 00:24:04,025
What's with the golf ball?

323
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,320
It's none of your business.

324
00:24:09,739 --> 00:24:11,199
Are you avoiding me?

325
00:24:12,117 --> 00:24:13,201
Yes.

326
00:24:14,452 --> 00:24:16,163
Stop avoiding me and let's talk.

327
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,046
What do you want me to say?

328
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,843
That all three of the pregnancy sticks
you got for me came out positive?

329
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:32,554
That I'm screwed because I'm pregnant?

330
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,473
That I'm going to get an abortion?

331
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,658
This is unfair.

332
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,793
We only did it twice.

333
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:08,048
We even used protection.

334
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:12,719
I'm sorry.

335
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,145
Did you bring money?

336
00:25:28,526 --> 00:25:29,945
It's 530,000 won.

337
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,032
Also, after my mom got a divorce,
she gave me this gold ring

338
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:36,034
that I had received for my first birthday.

339
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:38,078
My dad doesn't know.

340
00:25:47,629 --> 00:25:49,631
Abortion isn't officially legal yet.

341
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:51,633
It's not covered by insurance,
so it costs a lot.

342
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:55,345
Yeong-ju.

343
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,014
Let's think this through.

344
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:00,725
Shut up.

345
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:03,270
It's my body, my choice.

346
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,779
If you decide to get an abortion,

347
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:15,115
I'll look for the safest way to do it.

348
00:26:15,198 --> 00:26:17,075
-If you decide to have it--
-I can't.

349
00:26:18,368 --> 00:26:20,745
Let's be real. Are we that much in love?

350
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:25,417
What about college?

351
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,919
What about going to Seoul?

352
00:26:30,046 --> 00:26:33,174
Is what we have between us
worth giving everything up for a baby?

353
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,029
If our parents find out about this,

354
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,073
your dad, a former thug, will kill you.

355
00:26:57,157 --> 00:26:58,283
As for my dad,

356
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,911
he'll probably commit suicide
instead of hurting me.

357
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,001
So just keep your mouth shut.

358
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:41,368
Did you get permission from your parents?

359
00:27:42,786 --> 00:27:45,205
Here. Write down their phone numbers.

360
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:49,209
If you can't, I'll pay you
200,000 won per don.

361
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:53,588
You said it would be 220,000 won per don.

362
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:01,679
Take it or leave it.

363
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,281
DAMO
GOLD, SILVER, JEWELRY, WATCHES

364
00:28:24,619 --> 00:28:26,287
I want 420,000 won for 2 don.

365
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,832
That's my lowest offer.

366
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:04,826
Did you sell it? How much did you get?

367
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:07,245
I got 410,000 won for 2 don.

368
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,458
Are you really going to get an abortion?

369
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:12,625
Yes.

370
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,218
I heard these work
if it's been less than 12 weeks.

371
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,355
Instead of going to the academy today,

372
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,399
why don't we just spend time together?

373
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,237
I may be getting an abortion,
but I still have a life to live.

374
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,880
You used a cheap condom, didn't you?

375
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,924
You did, didn't you?

376
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,551
I'll kill you if I really turn out
to be pregnant.

377
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,103
Aren't you going to the academy?

378
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,024
I can't.

379
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:22,028
The money I gave you was for the academy.

380
00:30:46,719 --> 00:30:49,514
We only do surgery for those who have
been pregnant for less than seven weeks.

381
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:53,017
But are you sure that
you've been pregnant for three months?

382
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:54,853
-Frankly, I'm not sure.
-It's Yeong-ju.

383
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,230
-Hey.
-Hey, Yeong-ju.

384
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,567
I have one more question.

385
00:31:01,818 --> 00:31:02,819
Wellâ€¦

386
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:05,280
The thing isâ€¦

387
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:10,577
I bought some pills online.

388
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:13,413
The pills that are sold online
are 100 percent fake.

389
00:31:13,955 --> 00:31:15,623
They can severely harm your body.

390
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:18,501
Hello?

391
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:20,837
Hello?

392
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,402
Let's take a look at question number 21.

393
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:47,947
You can see both the exponential
and logarithmic functions.

394
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,909
What's the first thing you need to do?

395
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:54,495
That's right. You need to check
if it's an inverse function.

396
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:56,164
What's next?

397
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:59,542
Yes, you need to check
the straight line with a slope

398
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,920
-of minus one--
-Damn it.

399
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:13,181
Let's carry on.

400
00:32:13,723 --> 00:32:18,311
We need to check the graph
that has a slope

401
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,812
of minus one.

402
00:32:19,896 --> 00:32:23,942
Then we're going to check
the characteristics of that slope.

403
00:32:24,025 --> 00:32:27,320
Now, here are some of the things
that I want you guys to look out forâ€¦

404
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,664
Make sure you don't get hurt.

405
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,415
Can I cut in line?

406
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,671
-You can do it!
-Did youâ€¦

407
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,048
take the pills?

408
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:51,803
The nurse told me
that those pills are fake.

409
00:32:53,513 --> 00:32:55,390
She told me not to take them.

410
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:57,433
None of you will succeed.

411
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:58,851
-Just go sit down.
-Shut it.

412
00:33:04,107 --> 00:33:07,485
I swear you won't make it.
Your legs are too short.

413
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:08,945
-Listen to me.
-Cut it out.

414
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:12,240
-Let's do this.
-Come on.

415
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,783
-Jeez.
-Jump!

416
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,952
-Let's do this.
-I'm watching you.

417
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:18,329
You can do it.

418
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:22,750
-Next.
-What's wrong?

419
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,511
Bang Yeong-ju, jump!

420
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,014
Bang Yeong-ju, jump!

421
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,564
Hey, Yeong-ju.

422
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,524
Are you okay?

423
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,235
You're sweating so much.

424
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:50,778
Are you sick?

425
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:54,657
Ma'am, can I go home?

426
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,327
I think I have enteritis.

427
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,872
Okay, sure. Go ahead.

428
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:05,918
-You're so lucky that you're sick.
-Be quiet!

429
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:09,714
Let's go, Jung Hyeon! Jump!

430
00:34:10,798 --> 00:34:13,217
Come on, Hyeon! Hurry up and jump!

431
00:34:13,301 --> 00:34:15,595
-Jump already!
-What is he doing?

432
00:34:15,678 --> 00:34:17,555
Will you just go?

433
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:26,230
-Where is he going?
-Hey! Hyeon!

434
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:28,066
-Where is he off to?
-Hey!

435
00:34:33,696 --> 00:34:35,907
LET'S GO TO SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY
COLLEGE OF MEDICINE!

436
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:49,712
Are you sick?

437
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:54,759
I read online that it could hurt
if the baby starts kicking.

438
00:34:58,721 --> 00:35:00,014
I'm going to the hospital.

439
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:03,017
If I get there before 3 p.m.,
I might be able to get the surgery.

440
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:06,104
I'll come with you.
I'll tell the teacher I need to go home.

441
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:07,688
Are you crazy?

442
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,440
People might see us and spread rumors.

443
00:35:16,781 --> 00:35:19,075
This doesn't feel right.

444
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,993
Yeong-ju, I heard it's really painful.

445
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:22,453
So what if it's painful?

446
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,914
Time is passing by even as we're talking.

447
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,250
The bigger the baby gets,

448
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,502
the more dangerous it'll be
for the both of us.

449
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:33,798
Let's try to find a good hospital

450
00:35:33,881 --> 00:35:36,717
instead of just going anywhere.

451
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,929
If you truly care about me, then move.

452
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:41,973
Are you guys going out?

453
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:43,599
Why are you always together?

454
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,563
Hyeon, why did you leave
in the middle of class?

455
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,398
Our homeroom teacher wants to see you.

456
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:53,442
Yeong-ju, do you have period cramps?

457
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,361
Cut the bullshit, you pervert.

458
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:58,614
What's your problem? Are you nuts?

459
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,664
Damn it.

460
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:08,749
ONJEONG OB-GYN

461
00:36:12,753 --> 00:36:14,130
Doors closing.

462
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:18,092
GYNECOLOGICAL EXAMS
THAT EVERY WOMAN SHOULD GET

463
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,771
Shouldn't you be at school?

464
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,612
We only had morning classes today.

465
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,531
What are you doing here?

466
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,992
I was meeting a client nearby andâ€¦

467
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,081
The doctor says I have menopause.

468
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:52,919
What about you? What brings you here?

469
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:57,465
Irregular periods.

470
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:00,218
See, you brat?
This is why you need to eat well.

471
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,178
It's because you're always on a diet.

472
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,804
That's why it's irregular.

473
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,265
You're just a teenager.

474
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,062
Hey.

475
00:37:12,271 --> 00:37:14,398
Do you want me to go with you?

476
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,027
-Did you feel embarrassed that you came--
-No.

477
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,196
It's okay.

478
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,670
She's always skipping meals.

479
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,440
OB-GYN KANG JUN-SEOK

480
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:05,908
When did you last have sex?

481
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,540
Do I have to tell you?

482
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,667
Yes.

483
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,767
-Is the ultrasound necessary?
-Yes, it's necessary.

484
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:37,565
The period from three months ago
could have been implantation bleeding.

485
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,369
I knew it.

486
00:38:50,453 --> 00:38:52,163
Teenagers are always like this.

487
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,541
Twenty-two weeks.

488
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:59,003
You've been pregnant for six months.

489
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,582
If the baby is six months old, we need to
carry out an induced-labor abortion.

490
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,752
But due to partial placenta previa,

491
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,254
there will be a lot of bleeding.

492
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,801
What does placenta previa mean?

493
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,804
Look it up online,

494
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:51,931
and bring a consent form
signed by a parent.

495
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,101
Abortion isn't illegal anymore.

496
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:57,269
Why do you need a parental consent form?

497
00:39:58,104 --> 00:39:59,980
Nothing's been settled by law.

498
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:03,359
If you can't bring a consent form,

499
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:05,611
find yourself another doctor.

500
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:08,864
If you need immediate help,

501
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:11,909
call this hotline for crisis counseling.

502
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:17,123
I gave you this number,
which means I did my part.

503
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,931
Why are you treating me like a kid?

504
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:36,392
Is it because I'm just a teenager?

505
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,146
It's your fault
you didn't use proper protection.

506
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,006
Doctor.

507
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,678
Can't I just get the surgery?

508
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:17,099
Jung Hyeon.

509
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,687
Why do you like the sea?

510
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:28,611
I really hate the sea here in Jeju.

511
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,074
I'm going to leave as soon as I turn 20.

512
00:41:41,373 --> 00:41:43,834
You really should study harder.

513
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:44,877
Hey.

514
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,171
How could you come in fifth?

515
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:49,798
Your grades never went down this low.
What went wrong?

516
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:53,177
Whenever I sit down to study,
I just can't stop thinking about you.

517
00:41:57,056 --> 00:42:00,142
Get to your senses.
This isn't going to last forever.

518
00:42:01,268 --> 00:42:02,520
Do you not love me?

519
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:11,278
Do you still believe in love
after what happened between your parents?

520
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,698
Here's what I learned from my parents.

521
00:42:15,824 --> 00:42:17,326
Love doesn't exist.

522
00:42:17,993 --> 00:42:20,663
Apparently, my parents were madly in love.

523
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,749
But in the end,
my mom abandoned me and my dad.

524
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,459
The same with your mom.

525
00:42:25,543 --> 00:42:28,379
I gave her permission to go.

526
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:32,216
Anywayâ€¦

527
00:42:33,592 --> 00:42:35,469
love never lasts.

528
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:40,891
Our feelings for each other will
eventually fade with time

529
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:42,434
like they never even existed.

530
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:48,566
It could beâ€¦

531
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,528
different for us.

532
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,287
I like that you're so pure at heart.

533
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:36,113
Yeong-ju.

534
00:43:36,196 --> 00:43:37,990
Where are you? Why aren't you replying?

535
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:40,909
Will you please tell me where you are?

536
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:49,752
Move aside! Handcart coming through!

537
00:43:49,835 --> 00:43:51,712
Make way for the ice!

538
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,714
-Hey, did you eat?
-Yes.

539
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,175
Make way for the ice!
Handcart coming through!

540
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,636
Hey, you look great today.

541
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:00,596
-Nonsense.
-Did something good happen?

542
00:44:01,722 --> 00:44:03,807
-Make way for the ice!
-Did you eat?

543
00:44:03,891 --> 00:44:05,559
Be careful not to hurt your back.

544
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:08,896
Coming through. Make way for the ice.

545
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,231
Make way for the ice.

546
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,775
I'll have this.

547
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,403
Hey, I ran into Yeong-ju.

548
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,616
Where? She should be in school right now.

549
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,284
At the OB-GYN.

550
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,036
What?

551
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:43,097
It's your fault
you didn't use proper protection.

552
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:04,952
Yeong-ju.

553
00:45:06,286 --> 00:45:07,454
Are you okay?

554
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,666
I'm worried.

555
00:45:11,291 --> 00:45:12,835
Please tell me you're okay.

556
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:22,636
I couldn't get the surgery.

557
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:24,805
I'm six months pregnant.

558
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:35,107
The doctor asked
for a parental consent form.

559
00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:38,110
What am I going to do?

560
00:45:45,451 --> 00:45:46,910
Let's think about it.

561
00:45:48,787 --> 00:45:50,164
What's there to think about?

562
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:52,124
I'm getting rid of it.

563
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,297
YEONG-JU

564
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:08,432
That babyâ€¦

565
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,191
is my baby too.

566
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:21,361
Don't call it "baby."

567
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:28,410
Don't make me a bad person.

568
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:33,165
Don't make me feel guilty.

569
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,354
What's that on your stomach?

570
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,460
Hey. You don't need
to wear a slimming belt.

571
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,837
-You look just fine.
-Please just stop.

572
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:23,632
What did the doctor say?

573
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:30,013
Eun-hui told me
that you have irregular periods.

574
00:47:30,097 --> 00:47:32,641
Did the doctor tell you why?

575
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:37,771
Just stop.

576
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,025
It's not a big deal.
It's common among women.

577
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:49,324
I don't want to talk
about irregular periods with you.

578
00:47:50,325 --> 00:47:53,453
Who else can you talk about this with?
You don't have a mother.

579
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:54,871
That's enough.

580
00:47:57,624 --> 00:48:00,168
-I need to study.
-Fine. Go ahead and study.

581
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:03,297
I bought beef, your favorite.

582
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:06,675
Eun-hui told me that the best cure
for irregular periods is to eat well.

583
00:48:06,758 --> 00:48:08,135
Study while I cook this.

584
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,855
How did she end up
having irregular periods?

585
00:48:24,276 --> 00:48:28,530
I'm so concerned about her all the time.

586
00:48:34,953 --> 00:48:38,540
INDUCED-LABOR ABORTION,
MORE THAN 14 WEEKS PREGNANT

587
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:41,668
HOW DOES AN ABORTION WORK?

588
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:46,757
QUESTION

589
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:48,759
Can someone give me advice?

590
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,429
I'm a high school student.

591
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,182
My girlfriend is pregnant.

592
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,310
I'm not ready

593
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:01,313
to raise a baby.

594
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:04,983
My girlfriend wants to get an abortion.

595
00:49:16,870 --> 00:49:18,705
What worries me the mostâ€¦

596
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:21,583
is my girlfriend's body.

597
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,672
Does it hurt a lot after the surgery?

598
00:49:30,342 --> 00:49:33,428
Yeong-ju, don't flush the toilet so often.

599
00:49:33,512 --> 00:49:34,846
You're wasting water.

600
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,307
How do you feel after the abortion?

601
00:49:39,434 --> 00:49:40,977
Do you feel relieved?

602
00:49:44,064 --> 00:49:46,525
Do you forget about everything
after the surgery?

603
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,905
Will my girlfriend and I be able
to live our lives like nothing happened?

604
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,996
SUBMIT

605
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,999
CAN SOMEONE GIVE ME ADVICE?

606
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,814
Your post really touched me.

607
00:50:25,897 --> 00:50:28,483
I can tell that
you really love your girlfriend.

608
00:50:28,567 --> 00:50:30,402
Just stay by her side.

609
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,946
And if the surgery concerns you,

610
00:50:33,029 --> 00:50:34,656
why don't you buy abortion pills

611
00:50:34,740 --> 00:50:37,117
-for her instead?
-These damn brokers.

612
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:43,665
I threw up,

613
00:50:44,666 --> 00:50:46,918
then put my legs up on the wall
to reduce swelling.

614
00:50:48,003 --> 00:50:50,630
I'm massaging the bottom of my foot
with a golf ball.

615
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,844
I read online that
massaging the bottom of my foot

616
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,555
could cause uterine contractions
and lead to a miscarriage.

617
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,852
I just want the babyâ€¦

618
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:11,443
to disappear without anyone finding out.

619
00:51:29,836 --> 00:51:32,047
According to a friend of mine,

620
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:36,760
Juhyang Hospital lets you get an abortion
even if it's been over 20 weeks.

621
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,221
Yeong-ju.

622
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,849
It's hard, isn't it?

623
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,020
Yes.

624
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:51,691
It is.

625
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:56,363
Are you upset?

626
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:00,450
Yes.

627
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:04,412
I'm upset.

628
00:52:14,506 --> 00:52:16,716
I'm still going to the hospital
tomorrow morning.

629
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,385
They also open on Saturdays.

630
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:22,681
I'm going alone.

631
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,726
If you're there, I won't be able to do it.

632
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:30,146
Good night.

633
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,435
Let's begin. Are you ready?

634
00:53:13,982 --> 00:53:15,317
It'll be over soon.

635
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:18,194
You'll forget that any of this happened.

636
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:20,405
The pain you feel will disappear

637
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:22,574
as if it never even existed.

638
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:40,800
Why are you lying down
with your legs apart?

639
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:43,261
What's going on? Aren't you going to cook?

640
00:53:50,602 --> 00:53:52,938
Why are you getting dressed?
I told you to cook.

641
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,282
Hey.

642
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,994
I'm talking to you.
Where do you think you're going?

643
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:10,705
Hey, Hyeon.

644
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,249
Hyeon!

645
00:54:21,591 --> 00:54:23,677
Yeong-ju, where are you?

646
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:26,137
The bus stop.

647
00:54:26,221 --> 00:54:29,099
-Which bus stop?
-Jeongchi Intersection.

648
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,311
It's over now.

649
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:37,816
When I come back on this bus,
