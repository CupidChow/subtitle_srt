1
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:29,112
CHUN-HUI AND EUN-GI

2
00:00:31,781 --> 00:00:33,700
CHUN-HUI AND EUN-GI

3
00:02:50,378 --> 00:02:51,754
Ms. Kang?

4
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:16,863
Ms. Kang.

5
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:29,792
Ms. Kang.

6
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,711
Goodness.

7
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,088
What are you doing out in this cold?

8
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:37,425
What's all this?

9
00:03:37,508 --> 00:03:40,553
Dong-i, Dong-seok,
and their father's clothes.

10
00:03:42,347 --> 00:03:44,933
You still kept their old clothes

11
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,559
after all this time?

12
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,111
Hey, it's my friend, Dong-i.

13
00:04:01,407 --> 00:04:04,244
Why are you burning photos
of you and Dong-seok too?

14
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:06,371
Why aren't you keeping them?

15
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:11,000
Check and see if I should leave
anything behind.

16
00:04:11,501 --> 00:04:15,546
I've just kept them all along
since I was illiterate.

17
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,925
These are…

18
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:22,136
all useless.

19
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,180
Is that so?

20
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:27,558
Ms. Kang!

21
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:30,395
Goodness!

22
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,524
Jeez!

23
00:04:35,149 --> 00:04:38,152
Ms. Kang, you could've gotten hurt!

24
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,197
Why would you do this by yourself?

25
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,533
You could've asked me for help.

26
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:52,166
Ms. Kang, wait.

27
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,794
There's…

28
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,133
I'm sure you have a lot to do today.

29
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,177
I hope the fish you buy is cheap today.

30
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:25,533
CHUN-HUI AND EUN-GI 1

31
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:47,346
You can do it, Mom and Dad!

32
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,516
You can do it, Mom and Dad!

33
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,436
You can do it, Mom and Dad!

34
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,481
You can do it, Mom and Dad!

35
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,776
-A frog can swim
-A frog can swim

36
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,487
-A lobster has claws
-Good job.

37
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,738
Well done.

38
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,783
-Thank you.
-Seaweeds can wave

39
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:09,827
Ta-da, it's a conch

40
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:14,999
What was that?

41
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,834
-I'll win next time.
-Dad…

42
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,588
Honey, you won.

43
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,298
-You won, Dad!
-That's enough.

44
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:24,509
He must be a dolphin.

45
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,052
How is he so good at this?

46
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,554
Dad, you won!

47
00:06:28,638 --> 00:06:30,264
Eun-gi, I won!

48
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:33,059
Up you go!

49
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,854
Eun-gi! We won!

50
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:40,066
My dad won! I won!

51
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,026
Let's eat.

52
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:44,320
-That's enough.
-We won!

53
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,613
We won!

54
00:07:00,628 --> 00:07:02,713
That star is Ppoppo.

55
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:07,718
Is that really Ppoppo?

56
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,263
Of course.

57
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:15,017
Ppoppo, our dog who was recently hit
by a car, turned into that star.

58
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:18,354
And that one.

59
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:21,649
That's Ppalgang,
our goldfish that died last year.

60
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,276
And that one.

61
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:27,196
That's the black cat you saw
on the street two months ago.

62
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:33,786
Will our family
also turn into stars when we die?

63
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:36,372
Of course. We'll shine brightly.

64
00:07:37,874 --> 00:07:38,958
Eun-gi.

65
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,754
Those stars are my brothers.

66
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,260
They're my twin older brothers
who passed away from measles

67
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,346
when I was little.

68
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,557
My third older brother is there too.

69
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,560
And that star

70
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:02,148
is my dad. Your grandpa.

71
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:07,278
I'm not sad that they're dead
since they've turned into stars.

72
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:11,157
They've become pretty stars
that we can look at every day.

73
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:12,909
You're right.

74
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:16,120
Then I shouldn't be sad about Ppoppo.

75
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,456
I can always look at that star.

76
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,001
That's right.

77
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,382
-Dad.
-What?

78
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:31,052
Who died and became the moon?

79
00:08:31,636 --> 00:08:32,678
No one.

80
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:37,350
No one became the moon.
The moon is just the moon.

81
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,395
It protects the stars
and grants our wishes.

82
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,815
Stop lying to her, will you?

83
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,817
Leave us be.

84
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:51,989
Eun-gi.

85
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,909
Where are we going next spring
when we go to Jeju?

86
00:08:54,992 --> 00:08:57,328
-Where there are 100 moons.
-And what's 100?

87
00:08:57,411 --> 00:08:58,955
Ten times ten.

88
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:02,250
-You're right.
-Unbelievable.

89
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:06,045
Eun-gi, don't believe him.
There's only one moon.

90
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,130
Am I a liar?

91
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,342
No. We always go camping
when you say we would.

92
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:14,011
Right? I'm not a liar, am I?

93
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,179
Jeez.

94
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:19,058
Are we really going to Jeju?

95
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,352
I like it here in Mokpo.

96
00:09:21,936 --> 00:09:24,730
What did I say
about making a wish to those moons?

97
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:28,150
Then all 100 of my wishes
will come true at once.

98
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,905
I'll become a good swimmer
and see dolphins, my favorite animals.

99
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:36,867
You won't go far away for work
and will play with me every day.

100
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:40,079
Mom won't scold or get mad at me.

101
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,498
And Grandma's back will get better.

102
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,979
Grandma Chun-hui,

103
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,401
the strongest person on earth,
lives in Jeju too.

104
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:12,695
You know her, right?

105
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:15,072
We visited her two years ago.

106
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,201
Come on. We video-called her often.
Don't you remember?

107
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:21,037
I do.

108
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,499
By the way,
is she really stronger than you?

109
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,169
Of course, she is. I'm no match for her.

110
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,590
-A calf cries moo
-A calf cries moo

111
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:38,304
She's much stronger than me.

112
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:42,475
She saved many men who were bigger than me

113
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:45,895
from drowning in the sea.

114
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:51,317
She catches octopuses that are bigger
than me with just one hand.

115
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,527
She's also friends with dolphins.

116
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:58,532
They swim and play together every day.

117
00:10:58,616 --> 00:10:59,992
What else?

118
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:05,581
She can hold her breath underwater
much longer than I can.

119
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:08,417
-What else?
-Grandma Chun-hui can carry you

120
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:11,128
on her shoulders every day.

121
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,299
She's the boss of Jeju and the sea.

122
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,759
Boss?

123
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:22,848
Neither Mom nor Dad can beat her.

124
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:27,228
No one can beat her.
She's the strongest of all.

125
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:53,879
When I go to Jeju,

126
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,591
I'm going to ride the moon boat
that'll grant our wishes.

127
00:11:58,676 --> 00:11:59,844
What else?

128
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:04,932
Dad, what else?

129
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,110
UNITY

130
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,616
I wish I could go to Jeju.

131
00:12:23,451 --> 00:12:27,746
Dad can ride the moon boat,
and I can see 100 moons

132
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,582
and Grandma Chun-hui.

133
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,866
Dad, don't go.

134
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,952
-Dad…
-Eun-gi!

135
00:13:07,036 --> 00:13:08,787
I'll be back in 30 days.

136
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,247
That's ten times three.

137
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:13,000
Dad…

138
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,504
Dad, don't go.

139
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:21,008
Just go. Don't talk to her.

140
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,053
Be careful. Be safe.

141
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:27,097
You're all we have, so be careful.

142
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,599
I will, Hae-seon.

143
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:30,309
Eun-gi.

144
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,061
Stay safe.

145
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,813
-I'll come back with lots of money.
-Dad…

146
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,357
-Then let's ride the moon boat in Jeju.
-Dad…

147
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,317
-Don't go.
-Hurry up and go.

148
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:41,445
Dad…

149
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:45,449
He's leaving. Say bye.

150
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,868
-Bye.
-Bye.

151
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:56,085
Stop crying.

152
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,425
You must be insane.

153
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,635
I was happy when you said
you'd quit your job at the mart.

154
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:48,387
But now, a restaurant
and a convenience store?

155
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:51,098
I have to work at the mart all day.

156
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,268
I have no time to see my husband
at the hospital.

157
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,562
But I need to work.

158
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:01,692
I'll just part-time a bit
during the day and night time.

159
00:15:01,775 --> 00:15:03,777
Just sell this house
and pay for his bills.

160
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:08,282
We'll sell this house and go to Jeju
once he wakes up.

161
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,576
Then we'll buy that boat he wanted.

162
00:15:17,499 --> 00:15:19,126
Pack more of Eun-gi's clothes.

163
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,129
Don't make her stay in Jeju
for just two weeks.

164
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,507
Just keep her there
until her dad wakes up.

165
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,677
It'll only be for two weeks.

166
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:32,848
By then, I'll be fully adjusted
to my new jobs.

167
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,475
Then I'll bring her back here.

168
00:15:35,976 --> 00:15:37,227
Don't tell me

169
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,521
you still haven't told his mother

170
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,984
about her son's accident
or that he's hurt?

171
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,074
How could I tell her?

172
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:56,580
She said she'd buy us a boat,
a house, and a car

173
00:15:56,664 --> 00:15:58,707
if we came to Jeju.

174
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:02,169
That's why she's still working at her age.

175
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:06,298
Her husband and Man-su's brothers

176
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,801
all passed away and left her behind.

177
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,554
Man-su, her only son now,
had been a headache all his life.

178
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:16,600
And now, he's finally become mature.

179
00:16:17,351 --> 00:16:20,521
So how could I tell her
that he was in a car accident

180
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,024
and has been unconscious
for over a month now?

181
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:28,320
How could I ever tell her that?

182
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,655
How?

183
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:49,717
Drink this.

184
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:09,319
What should you say

185
00:17:09,945 --> 00:17:12,781
when Grandma Chun-hui
asks where your dad is?

186
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:15,909
That he's out working
to buy things for me.

187
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:17,745
Working where?

188
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:24,168
On Baengnyeong Island in the Yellow Sea.

189
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:25,753
"On Baengnyeong Island

190
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,505
in the Yellow Sea."

191
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,800
Well done.

192
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,678
You should use honorifics
when speaking to adults.

193
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:36,597
-Okay.
-Again.

194
00:17:37,431 --> 00:17:38,265
Yes, ma'am.

195
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,185
Are you going to tell her
that Dad is sick?

196
00:17:41,268 --> 00:17:43,729
Mom, come with me to Jeju.

197
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,981
Then what about Dad?

198
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:48,942
Should I leave him
all alone at the hospital?

199
00:17:49,026 --> 00:17:51,278
When you had a stomachache
and went to the hospital,

200
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,322
Dad and Mom were by your side.

201
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,824
So should he be alone this time?

202
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,537
Make sure to listen to your grandma.

203
00:18:01,038 --> 00:18:03,999
You'll only be staying with her
for 14 days.

204
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,003
After that, Mom and Dad will come to Jeju

205
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:10,339
to pick you up.

206
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:19,056
Then we will go to see the 100 moons
that'll grant all our wishes together.

207
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,893
And Dad will sail the moon boat.

208
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:28,440
So should you tell Grandma
that Dad is sick?

209
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:31,527
-No.
-Why not?

210
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:34,655
She'll be shocked.

211
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,950
She will faint and hurt her back
like my other grandma,

212
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,326
since she's old too.

213
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:43,497
That's right.
She's old and she will faint.

214
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,501
That will make Dad upset.
We don't want that, do we?

215
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:52,631
What if she wants to call him?

216
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:54,967
He's cutting trees in the mountains.

217
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,010
"Logging."

218
00:18:57,594 --> 00:19:00,556
He's logging,
so you won't be able to reach him.

219
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:10,107
It'll only be for 14 days.

220
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:11,650
After that,

221
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,403
Mom and Dad

222
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:17,239
will come to pick you up.

223
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,662
You have pain-relief patches
all over your body.

224
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,499
You'll kill yourself at that rate.
Don't be too greedy.

225
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:29,585
You overworked yourself today too.

226
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:33,088
Even we can't carry 60kg,
so why would you carry 70kg?

227
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,716
She's right. You shouldn't work too much.

228
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,345
If I was your partner,
you wouldn't be able to work properly.

229
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,472
You'd be busy keeping me in check.

230
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:47,561
Hye-ja, should I switch with Dal-i
and work with Ms. Hyeon instead?

231
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:49,062
You and Dal-i can be partners.

232
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,480
Don't be absurd!

233
00:19:50,564 --> 00:19:52,274
You'll be my partner
until the day you die!

234
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,444
-Did you hear that?
-Yes, ma'am.

235
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,905
Yeong-ok tried to be sly but failed.

236
00:19:57,988 --> 00:20:01,491
-Darn it…
-Goodness, Yeong-ok.

237
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:04,077
Isn't your granddaughter coming?

238
00:20:04,953 --> 00:20:08,248
I bet you're so excited.

239
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,375
Tell them to leave the next day.

240
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:14,213
Your son just sent his wife and daughter
since he was too busy.

241
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,381
Your daughter-in-law
won't be able to help out

242
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,550
and will just be a nuisance.

243
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,177
It's still nice that they're coming.

244
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,137
-Right.
-Not at all!

245
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,890
She'll be spending money
and giving Eun-gi pocket money.

246
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,351
She'll also have to cook for them.

247
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:29,102
You're jealous, aren't you?

248
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,189
Fine, I'm jealous!
My grandchild doesn't visit me!

249
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:33,523
Goodness.

250
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:35,692
Gosh.

251
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:38,153
-Buy her some snacks with this.
-Hey.

252
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,739
-No, that's okay.
-I insist!

253
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:43,283
-Come on!
-Buy her something tasty.

254
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,078
-Come on!
-It's okay.

255
00:20:46,161 --> 00:20:47,371
Hey, it's fine.

256
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:50,040
-I only have 10,000 won. Here.
-Goodness.

257
00:20:50,123 --> 00:20:51,500
Look at all that money.

258
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,585
-Gosh, let me go.
-Come on. It's okay.

259
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,504
-Don't give me any money.
-Here.

260
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:57,214
Goodness.

261
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,216
-Jeez.
-Darn it.

262
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:00,676
Just take it.

263
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:02,678
-Take it.
-Just take it.

264
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,638
Take some time off work.

265
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,891
She's happy.

266
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:10,227
-You're all unbelievable.
-Just take it.

267
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:31,748
You refused to receive treatment
for your cancer.

268
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:34,793
Are you praying to get better?

269
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,506
I prayed that I'll die quickly.

270
00:21:40,132 --> 00:21:41,383
You should pray too.

271
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,302
Jeez.

272
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:45,721
What's the point of making a wish?

273
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,849
My prayers never came true.

274
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:54,062
We both lost our children and husbands.

275
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,107
Wishing for anything is useless.

276
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,988
How long will Eun-gi be staying here?

277
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:05,365
I'm not sure. Her mom is busy.

278
00:22:06,616 --> 00:22:10,203
Fate must finally be smiling upon you
in your later years.

279
00:22:11,079 --> 00:22:14,291
Man-su has become mature.
Your daughter-in-law is wonderful.

280
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:16,335
And so is your granddaughter.

281
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,545
Are you jealous?

282
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,507
I'm extremely jealous.

283
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,469
Be happy.

284
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:30,640
Don't try to hide your happiness
just because you feel bad for me.

285
00:22:32,893 --> 00:22:35,062
At least you should be happy.

286
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:37,689
I'm truly happy for you.

287
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,446
Goodness.

288
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,208
What?

289
00:23:04,674 --> 00:23:06,009
Who are you?

290
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:08,720
I'm Son Eun-gi.

291
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,264
Eun-gi!

292
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,310
You're finally here, my puppy!

293
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,397
She's Man-su's daughter.

294
00:23:19,481 --> 00:23:20,941
She grew up a lot.

295
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,235
Goodness.

296
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:24,694
My goodness.

297
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,826
Don't bother cleaning.
We all live like that around here.

298
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,870
Just let it be. This will be
my lifestyle until the day I die.

299
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,790
Don't say that.

300
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,169
You should live
a long, happy life with us.

301
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,421
I'm done.

302
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,511
Let me just wipe the floor.

303
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,055
Have some.

304
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:58,395
You're very thorough.

305
00:24:00,564 --> 00:24:01,648
Here.

306
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,362
-The tangerines are sweet.
-Are they?

307
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,036
Just for 15 days.

308
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:19,416
I mean, I'll come back in two weeks
to pick her up, Mother.

309
00:24:21,418 --> 00:24:25,630
Man-su is away at Baengnyeong Island
logging for months.

310
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:29,467
Recently, my boss recognized my talents.

311
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:32,345
And I've finally been promoted
to a higher position.

312
00:24:34,222 --> 00:24:35,682
I'm the manager of the mart now.

313
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,978
I didn't want to decline the offer
because of Eun-gi.

314
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,356
I'll be getting a higher salary.

315
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,068
I think it'll be good
to save up some money

316
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:48,945
before we move to Jeju next year.

317
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,578
-Just two weeks?
-Of course.

318
00:24:57,245 --> 00:25:01,291
It'll be winter soon,
so I won't be diving that often.

319
00:25:01,374 --> 00:25:04,127
But I still do it every now and then.

320
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:08,340
If I don't work,
they'll struggle to meet their quota.

321
00:25:08,965 --> 00:25:10,300
Just do as she asks.

322
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:14,596
She's trying hard to make ends meet.
Of course, you should help.

323
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:20,810
Thanks to her, I'll be able
to see this little puppy for a long time.

324
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,448
You should go now.

325
00:25:34,699 --> 00:25:35,951
Before she wakes up.

326
00:25:36,826 --> 00:25:39,788
-Go.
-I don't need this, Mother.

327
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,540
You guys are the only reason
why she works.

328
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:44,751
We don't spend a lot of money here.

329
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,671
Take it with you, okay?

330
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:49,839
I'm sorry, Mother.

331
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,845
Make sure you at least pick up
Eun-gi's calls, okay?

332
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:57,597
Of course.

333
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,850
You should hurry and go. Go on.

334
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:07,190
Bye.

335
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:09,276
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

336
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:13,613
She's kindhearted.

337
00:26:14,197 --> 00:26:15,365
She sure is.

338
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,203
Goodness.

339
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:25,959
She has cute clam-like lips.

340
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:29,713
She's all curled up in a ball.

341
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,883
I can't believe she is your granddaughter.

342
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,553
I agree.

343
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,139
She's one precious angel.

344
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:08,752
Mom…

345
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:10,837
Mom…

346
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,631
Mom…

347
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,801
Look at you crying.

348
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,512
What's the point of crying? She's gone.

349
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,932
She abandoned you here and left.

350
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:24,517
That's enough.

351
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:26,394
Stop crying.

352
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:31,483
Did your mom tell you to cry
or to listen to me?

353
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,904
She told me to listen to you.

354
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,281
She still answers.

355
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,411
Stop crying now.

356
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:45,080
Mom…

357
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,999
Do you want me to give you the moon?

358
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:06,434
Pray to this moon every day.

359
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,646
Pray that your parents
will come to pick you up.

360
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:14,067
Then your parents will be here in no time.

361
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,990
Aren't you too old to be lying?

362
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:24,035
Your mom will come back eventually
even if you don't pray.

363
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,205
You should go inside.

364
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,748
I'm leaving now.

365
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,085
-Go home safely.
-Okay.

366
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,462
Goodness.

367
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:37,841
Let's go to bed, okay?

368
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:41,845
I need to pray to the moon first.

369
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:51,813
Since you're not listening to me,
I'm going to swallow this moon.

370
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:21,092
Look at you all heartbroken.
What will you do?

371
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:23,970
Grandma swallowed the moon.

372
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,557
Eun-gi.

373
00:29:28,266 --> 00:29:29,893
Look up.

374
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:37,734
It's up there, right?

375
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,821
Come in. It's cold.

376
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,740
You're going to freeze.

377
00:29:58,004 --> 00:30:00,256
Are those your belongings?

378
00:30:01,007 --> 00:30:03,718
Did your mom pack your bag

379
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:07,555
so you could stay here?

380
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,200
You only brushed twice,
and you're already done?

381
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:30,370
You barely brushed your teeth. Goodness.

382
00:30:47,512 --> 00:30:49,639
Grandma, what was that?

383
00:30:49,722 --> 00:30:51,140
What are you eating?

384
00:30:51,933 --> 00:30:55,228
-"Grandma, what did you eat?"
-Grandma, what did you eat?

385
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,314
Do you want snacks?

386
00:31:03,444 --> 00:31:06,531
Swallow it. Open your mouth.

387
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,700
Here's your snack.

388
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:14,205
My little Eun-gi.

389
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,585
Why didn't you take this off?

390
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:21,963
It's my rash guard. My swimming suit.

391
00:31:22,046 --> 00:31:24,132
I'm going to swim with you.

392
00:31:24,215 --> 00:31:27,719
I'm going to take it off
once you teach me how to swim.

393
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:31,264
It's too cold to swim now.

394
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,766
Do you like me?

395
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:37,395
-I do.
-Why do you like me?

396
00:31:37,979 --> 00:31:40,023
I swallowed the moon

397
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,858
and teased you.

398
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:46,279
Because you're a strong boss.

399
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:48,448
What are you talking about?

400
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,075
That's what my dad said.

401
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:54,621
He said you were friends with dolphins

402
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,539
and could swim well.

403
00:31:56,623 --> 00:32:01,502
He said you'd teach me
how to swim and dive underwater.

404
00:32:02,295 --> 00:32:04,839
He said you were stronger than him,

405
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,051
you saved a lot of people from drowning,
and you are the boss.

406
00:32:08,635 --> 00:32:10,970
Is that what he said?

407
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:13,056
Where is he?

408
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,310
Are you dumb?

409
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:19,812
Do you not know where your dad is?

410
00:32:20,813 --> 00:32:24,984
He's on Baengnyeong Island
in the Yellow Sea.

411
00:32:25,818 --> 00:32:27,111
What for?

412
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:30,573
To make money. He moves logs in his truck.

413
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:34,535
What is he going to do
with the money he makes?

414
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,579
He's going to come to Jeju.

415
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,917
We're going to come here
and live with you.

416
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,964
Goodness. You're one smart girl.

417
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:48,591
Then what should you do

418
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:52,845
until the day your dad comes?
Should you listen to what I say or not?

419
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:54,806
I should listen to you.

420
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,267
-Promise.
-I promise.

421
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:00,812
You promised.

422
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:06,317
If you break your promise,
I'm going to tell them not to come.

423
00:33:06,901 --> 00:33:11,114
Then you'll have to live with me forever

424
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,866
and never see your parents again.

425
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,453
I'm going to be a good girl.

426
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,207
Don't cry like you did today, okay?

427
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,333
Yes.

428
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:26,713
Let's go to bed. Goodness.

429
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,555
You have this too.

430
00:33:36,139 --> 00:33:38,266
My dad has it too.

431
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,228
I want one too.

432
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,190
Goodness, why would you want it?

433
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:48,234
This mark

434
00:33:48,985 --> 00:33:53,114
was only given
to the haenyeos here in Pureung.

435
00:33:55,199 --> 00:33:59,454
It's a symbol of unity
that we put on ourselves

436
00:34:00,079 --> 00:34:03,791
so that we'd work as one
when we went somewhere far away

437
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:06,461
such as Geoje Island for work.

438
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,505
So why would you want one?

439
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,007
Will you become a haenyeo?

440
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:14,844
No. I can't become one since I can't swim.

441
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,432
Go to bed.

442
00:34:21,184 --> 00:34:22,435
Goodness.

443
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,736
Grandma, are you friends with dolphins?

444
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,407
No, I'm not. I don't like them.

445
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,658
Why not?

446
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:42,455
They could put us haenyeos in danger
if they come near us

447
00:34:43,206 --> 00:34:44,749
when we're working.

448
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:48,544
They're reckless.

449
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:51,047
They keep inviting us to play.

450
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:53,382
They're unlikable.

451
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,928
But I like dolphins.

452
00:34:57,678 --> 00:35:00,890
Grandma, can you put your arm
under my head?

453
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,642
What?

454
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:06,604
Do you want me to do that

455
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:09,315
and tell your parents not to come?

456
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:12,610
Or do you want to sleep by yourself

457
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,947
and wait until your parents
come to pick you up?

458
00:35:17,323 --> 00:35:22,078
I'll sleep by myself
and wait until my parents come.

459
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:27,708
Go to bed. Goodness.

460
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:32,213
My body aches all over.

461
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:34,173
Goodness, my body.

462
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,224
Goodness.

463
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:54,712
Kkokko. Bunny. Eat up.

464
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,548
Eun-gi.

465
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,134
Where are you? Eun-gi.

466
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:05,723
Kkokko. Bunny. See you later.

467
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,524
Grandma, what are you doing?

468
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,735
I'm making fish soup for you.

469
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:21,614
I like fish. What should I do?

470
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:24,742
Go set the table.

471
00:37:25,326 --> 00:37:27,328
-And wipe it with this.
-Yes.

472
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:28,454
Good.

473
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:34,377
Look at that. You're strong.

474
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:43,886
What? What's wrong?

475
00:37:43,970 --> 00:37:46,514
I can't eat the fish soup.

476
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:48,891
Its eyes look scary.

477
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,852
Why are you scared? It's dead.

478
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:55,147
This is good for you. Here.

479
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:58,067
This is good for your eyesight.

480
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,238
Goodness.

481
00:38:03,197 --> 00:38:04,407
Then…

482
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:16,335
Then have this.

483
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:26,220
Then what are you going to eat?

484
00:38:26,762 --> 00:38:29,056
This is my first time
raising a grandchild.

485
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:31,267
None of my sons complained before.

486
00:38:32,101 --> 00:38:34,395
What are you going to eat?

487
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,819
You don't want this either?

488
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,239
Give me your phone.

489
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,576
I'm going to tell your mom
that you're giving me a hard time.

490
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,619
I'll tell her not to come.

491
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,373
You could grill the fish for me.

492
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:57,293
You're supposed to grill it,
not make soup with it.

493
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,254
Grill it!

494
00:39:09,513 --> 00:39:10,848
What is it this time?

495
00:39:10,931 --> 00:39:13,225
It's burnt. It's black.

496
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:16,937
My mom told me not to eat burnt food.

497
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,814
She said I'd get cancer.

498
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:21,817
How absurd. You'll die of starvation.

499
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:26,280
Sausages, fried eggs,

500
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:29,367
chicken, milk,

501
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:31,619
cereal…

502
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:36,749
I'll have to go downtown to get them,

503
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,709
but I have no car.

504
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:44,924
I finally understand why
your hardworking parents don't have money.

505
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,718
Just eat this.

506
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,012
Suit yourself.

507
00:39:52,765 --> 00:39:55,142
It's delicious.

508
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:59,021
I'm going to call my mom
and tell her to pick me up.

509
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:00,898
Let me speak to her.

510
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,318
I'll tell her not to come
since you're being a bad girl.

511
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:05,444
Give that to me.

512
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,453
I'm tired.

513
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:16,580
Keep walking. A car will pick us up soon.

514
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:17,748
Carry me.

515
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,669
Why don't you carry me instead?

516
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:24,296
My dad said you were strong.

517
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,550
I'm not strong at all. I'm too old.

518
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,135
But my dad…

519
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,053
Your dad lied.

520
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,472
I'm old and weak.

521
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:34,598
I hate you!

522
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,517
You're a meanie!

523
00:40:37,643 --> 00:40:38,853
"A meanie"?

524
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,313
Look who's talking.
Do you want me to scold you?

525
00:40:41,397 --> 00:40:44,150
My dad isn't a liar!

526
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:46,527
I hate you, Grandma!

527
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:49,822
You didn't show me any dolphins!

528
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:52,992
You didn't teach me how to swim!

529
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:54,660
I hate you!

530
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:56,162
I hate you too.

531
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:00,166
Why didn't you wake up
this morning when I told you to?

532
00:41:00,249 --> 00:41:02,168
No matter how many times I said,

533
00:41:02,251 --> 00:41:06,338
"Let's go to the market,"
you never once woke up.

534
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:10,426
Had you woken up early,
we would've taken the car with the others.

535
00:41:12,428 --> 00:41:14,638
You refuse to eat or walk.

536
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,185
You're six years old
but still acting like a baby.

537
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:23,063
This is exactly why
your parents aren't coming.

538
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:26,942
Suit yourself.

539
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:30,946
You refuse to listen to me
despite being all grown up.

540
00:41:32,615 --> 00:41:34,158
Grandma!

541
00:41:34,742 --> 00:41:36,202
Grandma!

542
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:41,874
Come here.

543
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:55,930
You'll be here
for another ten days or so. This is bad.

544
00:42:01,894 --> 00:42:03,729
Come and take a look!

545
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,689
Pick whatever you want!

546
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,609
-How much?
-Five thousand won.

547
00:42:10,819 --> 00:42:12,738
Come take a look.

548
00:42:12,821 --> 00:42:14,448
It's really fresh.

549
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:16,283
-Two for her.
-Hello, ma'am.

550
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,035
We have fresh hairtail caught today!

551
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:19,787
We have fresh hairtail caught today!

552
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,789
-We also have chub mackerel.
-Three chub mackerels.

553
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:23,082
Come take a look.

554
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:26,752
Ice!

555
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,837
Ice!

556
00:42:28,921 --> 00:42:30,965
-Ice! Oh, sorry.
-Hey!

557
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:32,299
-Ice!
-Here.

558
00:42:32,383 --> 00:42:33,634
Try some.

559
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,719
-Jeez.
-Welcome.

560
00:42:35,803 --> 00:42:38,389
-We have hangover soup.
-Come have a bowl.

561
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:40,349
Welcome.

562
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:43,769
We have bracken, millet, and dried fish.

563
00:42:43,852 --> 00:42:45,437
-Thank you.
-See you again.

564
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:49,775
Is she staying here for good?

565
00:42:50,609 --> 00:42:53,862
Chun-hui's daughter-in-law
left that girl in her care temporarily.

566
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:55,739
For how long?

567
00:42:57,116 --> 00:43:00,536
I'll be staying here for 14 days.

568
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,454
It's been four days already.

569
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:05,583
-Fourteen days? Two weeks?
-Welcome.

570
00:43:08,627 --> 00:43:10,379
What's the matter?

571
00:43:11,797 --> 00:43:14,049
That woman's granddaughter.

572
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:16,135
What about her?

573
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:19,763
Her mom dropped her off
and said she'd come back in two weeks.

574
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,890
But that was over a year ago.

575
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,350
Really?

576
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:27,521
Her mom had cheated with her colleague
back on the mainland.

577
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,108
That's why she abandoned her kid
at her mother-in-law's.

578
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,610
It's been two years, not one.

579
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,070
But why would you even mention that?

580
00:43:36,363 --> 00:43:38,907
I'm just saying
that's how it is these days.

581
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:42,036
Mothers nowadays abandon
their kids so easily.

582
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:44,371
My mom isn't like that.

583
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,625
She would never lie to me.

584
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:49,877
She said,

585
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:54,506
she and my dad
would pick me up after 14 days.

586
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,009
Why would you say
such a thing in front of her?

587
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,012
I mean, I was just saying--

588
00:44:00,095 --> 00:44:01,639
You were just saying?

589
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,099
What a load of bullshit.

590
00:44:04,183 --> 00:44:05,309
What if I said

591
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:07,478
-the same thing
-Grandma…

592
00:44:07,561 --> 00:44:10,648
-about your daughter-in-law?
-Don't fight.

593
00:44:10,731 --> 00:44:12,399
-Take Eun-gi and go.
-Grandma…

594
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,693
-Go.
-How dare you?

595
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,488
-Watch what you say in front of the kid!
-Grandma…

596
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:20,032
No wonder your kids don't visit you.

597
00:44:20,115 --> 00:44:22,576
Look who's talking.
Does your kid visit you?

598
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,662
Does your son visit you?

599
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:27,247
-Unlike you, mine does.
-You have a miserable fate.

600
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:31,293
Your husband and your kids
all met untimely deaths.

601
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:34,963
-So that's rich coming from you.
-Hey, not all of my kids are dead.

602
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:37,174
I still have Man-su!

603
00:44:37,257 --> 00:44:38,175
That's enough!

604
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:42,471
Come and take a look.

605
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:47,476
Go! I said, leave!

606
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:49,728
-Go.
-You're despicable.

607
00:45:25,931 --> 00:45:28,392
Is your mom seeing someone?

608
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,602
Is there another man
who comes by your house?

609
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:33,522
Did your mom abandon you here?

610
00:45:33,605 --> 00:45:35,566
No, she didn't!

611
00:45:35,649 --> 00:45:38,402
Then it's settled. Why would you cry?

612
00:45:38,485 --> 00:45:42,614
They only say that
since you're a dirty crybaby

613
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,451
who doesn't eat well.

614
00:45:45,534 --> 00:45:47,619
They think your mom abandoned you.

615
00:45:47,703 --> 00:45:50,414
You woke me up early in the morning.

616
00:45:51,039 --> 00:45:54,168
You never fed me sausages or cereal.

617
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,880
You never showed me any dolphins.

618
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:00,716
You never tied my hair

619
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,594
and you didn't even let me
ride on your shoulders.

620
00:46:07,639 --> 00:46:10,142
Will you stop crying if I do those things?

621
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:11,935
Yes.

622
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:18,942
Hey, come here.

623
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,571
YOUTHFUL BLOUSE
FASHIONABLE FARMING HATS

624
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:23,780
Me?

625
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,824
Carry her on your shoulders.

626
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,453
Me?

627
00:46:29,536 --> 00:46:31,872
If you had a daughter,
she would've been Eun-gi's age.

628
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:35,250
He'll carry you on his shoulders instead.

629
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,252
So stay here and stop crying.

630
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:40,672
But…

631
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,056
Ho-sik.

632
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,226
She's Man-su's daughter.

633
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:55,479
Ms. Hyeon asked you
to carry her on your shoulders.

634
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:56,980
She did.

635
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,108
Goodness.

636
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:02,569
So you're Man-su's daughter?

637
00:47:03,320 --> 00:47:05,614
-Do you know my dad?
-Of course, I do.

638
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:09,034
We're good friends. I'm the older one.

639
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,286
Do you want me to carry you?

640
00:47:11,828 --> 00:47:12,746
Come here.

641
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:15,791
There we go.

642
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:19,253
Ask him for some money.

643
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:22,381
It's okay. He's your dad's friend too.

644
00:47:22,464 --> 00:47:23,507
Ask him.

645
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,884
Do you know what money is?

646
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:34,768
Pick one.

647
00:47:36,645 --> 00:47:37,854
Look at that.

648
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:39,648
-Thank you.
-So you do know.

649
00:47:39,731 --> 00:47:41,608
-Well done.
-Hold on.

650
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,280
Look at this dirty face.

651
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,490
Are you homeless or something?

652
00:47:49,283 --> 00:47:50,492
Hold on.

653
00:47:59,293 --> 00:48:01,670
Here. I'm only being nice
since you're Man-su's kid.

654
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,463
I don't give clothes to anyone.

655
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,882
-Go on.
-What do you say to him?

656
00:48:06,466 --> 00:48:08,760
-Thank you.
-Good girl.

657
00:48:08,844 --> 00:48:10,304
Let's go.

658
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:14,141
Make way! Man-su's daughter is coming!

659
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:15,934
Make way!

660
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:17,477
Come and take a look!

661
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:20,856
Make way! Man-su's daughter is coming!

662
00:48:20,939 --> 00:48:22,482
Make way!

663
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:27,279
Make way! Man-su's daughter is coming!

664
00:48:27,362 --> 00:48:29,656
Do they all know my dad?

665
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:33,285
Of course, they do.
They all know your grandma too.

666
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,912
Is my grandma the boss?

667
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:38,874
-Who told you that?
-My dad did.

668
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,752
He's right. She's the boss here.

669
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,004
In-gwon.

670
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:45,297
She's Man-su's kid.

671
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,632
-She is?
-Yes.

672
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,967
-Is your dad Man-su?
-Yes.

673
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,766
Eun-hui, I'm dying here.

674
00:48:55,849 --> 00:48:57,768
-Hi, Eun-gi.
-Help me.

675
00:48:57,851 --> 00:48:59,436
-Eun-gi, I'll carry you.
-Hi.

676
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:01,772
-Help me.
-Lucky you.

677
00:49:02,522 --> 00:49:05,776
-Isn't he a bit too tall for you?
-Right.

678
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,488
Yeong-ju will be due soon,
but I don't think I can carry the baby.

679
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:14,242
-Yeong-ok, have my baby.
-Jeez. Do you want to die?

680
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:16,328
Then I'll ask some other woman.

681
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:19,039
-What?
-Did I hurt your feelings?

682
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,749
What do you expect from me?

683
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,209
Eun-gi, hang tight.

684
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,503
Let's go.

685
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:28,840
Our parents want to meet you.

686
00:49:28,924 --> 00:49:30,008
-Meet me?
-Yes.

687
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,136
-Hey, you should visit them.
-It's the right thing to do.

688
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:36,431
What would you like?

689
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:38,266
It's 3 for 10,000 won.
The big one is 5,000 won.

690
00:49:57,327 --> 00:50:00,956
Don't take what that woman said to heart.

691
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,878
Something feels off.

692
00:50:07,629 --> 00:50:11,007
It's unlike him
not to call me for over a month.

693
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:17,431
-The number you have dialed…
-Is it ringing?

694
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,225
Please leave a message after the beep.

695
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:23,061
It's still turned off.

696
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:25,439
It was off last month too.

697
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,736
I heard there's no reception
on Baengnyeong Island.

698
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:32,612
Maybe that's why he turned it off.

699
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:36,241
There's reception everywhere
in this day and age.

700
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:41,204
There's even reception on Mara Island
and the Chuja Islands.

701
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:44,416
It's hard to get reception
when you're out logging.

702
00:50:45,208 --> 00:50:47,335
There's no reception
in Mount Halla either.

703
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:51,757
I should be able to reach him
when he's delivering the logs downtown.

704
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:53,592
But I couldn't.

705
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:57,679
Does Eun-gi's mom pick up her calls?

706
00:50:58,930 --> 00:51:00,223
Only at night.

707
00:51:01,516 --> 00:51:02,684
She's working after all.

708
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,567
But how could she bring Eun-gi
all the way here

709
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:14,070
instead of taking her to kindergarten?

710
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,365
I'm starting to get suspicious
as time goes by.

711
00:51:19,284 --> 00:51:21,077
Then call and ask her.

712
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,746
What should I say?

713
00:51:22,829 --> 00:51:25,499
"Are you having an affair?"

714
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:28,710
"Is that why you've split with Man-su?"

715
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:32,798
"Is Man-su
drinking his life away somewhere?"

716
00:51:32,881 --> 00:51:35,926
What's stopping you?
She'll deny it if that's not the case.

717
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:43,517
You're right. What's stopping me?

718
00:51:46,728 --> 00:51:49,314
Is your name really Byeol-i as in "stars"?

719
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:53,777
-And you're Dal-i as in the "moon"?
-Yes.

720
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,655
I like both stars and the moon.

721
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,741
The moon grants our wishes, right?

722
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,493
Probably.

723
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:05,121
I'm going to see 100 moons
when my dad comes.

724
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:08,041
A hundred of them? Where?

725
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:09,793
I bought them.

726
00:52:21,346 --> 00:52:24,891
Hey, stop playing hard to get.
Gi-jun is a decent guy.

727
00:52:25,851 --> 00:52:27,936
I'm going to stay with you.

728
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,314
I'll live next door
if you guys get married.

729
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:32,941
Thank you.

730
00:52:33,024 --> 00:52:34,526
I don't like Gi-jun.

731
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,070
I don't like guys
who work at sea like you.

732
00:52:41,157 --> 00:52:42,492
She doesn't dislike you.

733
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:46,329
She's just worried
because you work at sea just like me.

734
00:52:47,247 --> 00:52:48,081
Go to her.

735
00:53:01,803 --> 00:53:03,054
Do you want to play?

736
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:05,265
-Yes.
-Go play.

737
00:53:05,807 --> 00:53:08,560
If you get lost, say that
Ms. Hyeon is your grandma.

738
00:53:08,643 --> 00:53:09,686
They'll take you to her.

739
00:53:09,769 --> 00:53:13,231
Okay. Everyone knows her
since she's the boss.

740
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,735
Hey! Let me play with you!

741
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:21,031
Hot coffee. Cold coffee.

742
00:53:21,114 --> 00:53:23,533
Iced tea. Misugaru.

743
00:53:25,952 --> 00:53:27,329
You're good.

744
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:30,540
Are you from the mainland?

745
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:32,834
"Mainland"? What's that?

746
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:35,670
-Did you take a ship here?
-Yes, with my mom.

747
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:38,840
I also took the ship here with my mom.

748
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:42,093
-Did your mom go back without you?
-Yes.

749
00:53:42,177 --> 00:53:44,930
So you were abandoned just like me.

750
00:53:45,597 --> 00:53:47,933
The grandmas at the market said so.

751
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,894
They said you were abandoned just like me.

752
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:52,520
That's not true!

753
00:53:53,104 --> 00:53:56,149
It's true. My mom left me.

754
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:58,026
And your mom did too.

755
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,903
So let's be friends.

756
00:53:59,986 --> 00:54:01,196
That's not true!

757
00:54:01,279 --> 00:54:04,074
Your mom abandoned you, but not mine!

758
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:05,992
You're the only one who doesn't know!

759
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,328
She abandoned you
just like my mom abandoned me!

760
00:54:11,164 --> 00:54:14,042
You're mean!
I don't want to play with you!

761
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,089
Hey! What's wrong?

762
00:54:19,714 --> 00:54:21,591
What's the matter?

763
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,635
Eun-gi, what happened?

764
00:54:24,386 --> 00:54:25,679
Eun-gi.

765
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:30,558
I didn't do anything wrong!

766
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,185
Still.

767
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,980
You shouldn't shout at your grandma!

768
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:39,859
She said my mom abandoned me!
That's not true!

769
00:54:41,236 --> 00:54:43,822
Then you could've just denied it.

770
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:46,199
Why did you have to throw sand at her?

771
00:54:46,282 --> 00:54:49,411
I did that, but she still made me mad.

772
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:53,081
She made me upset!

773
00:54:53,164 --> 00:54:55,709
You should be on my side!

774
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:58,378
Why aren't you siding with me?

775
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:01,756
Her grandma bad-mouthed me!

776
00:55:02,257 --> 00:55:04,467
I did nothing wrong!

777
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:08,263
So why are you
getting mad at me, you meanie?

778
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,850
Where did you learn
to hit your chest like that?

779
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,852
Did your mom do that?

780
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:16,604
-Or was it your grandma?
-Mom…

781
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:18,314
I understand.

782
00:55:19,441 --> 00:55:22,610
Don't cry. That's enough.

783
00:55:23,194 --> 00:55:25,989
You're on an empty stomach.
You're going to tire yourself out.

784
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,742
-That's enough. Goodness.
-Goodness.

785
00:55:28,825 --> 00:55:30,076
Stop crying.

786
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,704
Oh, dear.

787
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:36,708
You were upset
that I didn't side with you.

788
00:55:36,791 --> 00:55:39,544
Stop crying.

789
00:55:40,336 --> 00:55:41,713
That's enough.

790
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:49,804
Call your daughter-in-law.

791
00:55:50,430 --> 00:55:52,348
Stop troubling yourself.

792
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:54,851
Later.

793
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,188
Eun-gi will die crying at this rate.

794
00:55:59,064 --> 00:56:00,106
Just call her already.

795
00:56:01,941 --> 00:56:05,528
Be straightforward
and ask if she abandoned Eun-gi.

796
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:26,883
DAUGHTER-IN-LAW

797
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:36,768
Is she not picking up?

798
00:56:50,949 --> 00:56:52,283
Try calling with this.

799
00:56:53,368 --> 00:56:54,619
Eun-gi's phone.

800
00:57:01,751 --> 00:57:02,627
MOM

801
00:57:23,022 --> 00:57:25,108
The number you have dialed
cannot be reached.

802
00:57:25,191 --> 00:57:27,402
How could she not pick up
her own kid's call?

803
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,028
What if Eun-gi falls ill?

804
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,947
Call their house.

805
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:33,199
They don't have a home phone.

806
00:57:35,201 --> 00:57:38,788
I told her to pick up
Eun-gi's call no matter what.

807
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,834
Call her workplace.

808
00:57:43,418 --> 00:57:45,670
Doesn't she work
at a big mart that opens until late?

809
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,506
I don't know the number.

810
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,191
Eun-hui.

811
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:10,778
Can you call Mokpo Mart,

812
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:15,658
look for Oh Hae-seon, and call me back?

813
00:58:15,742 --> 00:58:16,659
Yes.

814
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:18,745
Yes. Right now.

815
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:51,569
Hey, Eun-hui.

816
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:55,573
What?

817
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,079
Really?

818
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:02,830
When?

819
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,169
It's nothing. Good night.

820
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,841
What did she say?

821
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:16,844
Hae-seon…

822
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:20,473
doesn't work there anymore.

823
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,813
She quit a few days ago.

824
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,570
Where has that kindhearted girl gone…

825
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,991
after abandoning her own child?

826
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:42,745
Where did she go?

827
00:59:45,081 --> 00:59:46,749
Where could she be?

828
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:52,964
Where is she?

829
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:29,542
Just do as the doctor says.

830
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,003
I told her

831
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:36,049
to just let Man-su die.

832
01:00:37,467 --> 01:00:38,718
Why did you call?

833
01:00:39,427 --> 01:00:41,596
I missed you.

834
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:47,644
I'm going to pray 100 times
so that my dad will recover.

835
01:00:47,727 --> 01:00:49,937
Man-su wants to say goodbye.

836
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,148
No ship or plane will be available.

837
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:55,610
How could fate be so cruel?

838
01:00:58,363 --> 01:01:03,368
