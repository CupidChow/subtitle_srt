1
00:00:32,906 --> 00:00:39,506
(While Eddie served the elders on his own last week, )

2
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:42,475
(the 3 Country members back in their room...)

3
00:00:42,476 --> 00:00:45,615
Since Kyun is doing all of that,

4
00:00:45,616 --> 00:00:48,115
I'm not sure what we should do.

5
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:50,397
(They're worried about Eddie working so hard on his own.)

6
00:00:51,386 --> 00:00:53,425
- It's almost 4pm right now.
- Right.

7
00:00:53,426 --> 00:00:56,155
In two hours, it'll be time for dinner.

8
00:00:56,156 --> 00:00:58,155
- I know.
- So shouldn't we prepare dinner...

9
00:00:58,156 --> 00:00:59,796
on our own?

10
00:01:00,096 --> 00:01:01,965
- Should we?
- If we want to eat,

11
00:01:01,966 --> 00:01:04,396
- we should make something.
- That's a good idea.

12
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:07,835
Chef cooked for us...

13
00:01:07,836 --> 00:01:10,536
- Almost every day.
- almost every day.

14
00:01:10,936 --> 00:01:13,146
Instead of making just one dish all together,

15
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,706
should we each make one?

16
00:01:15,346 --> 00:01:16,716
- Each?
- Yes.

17
00:01:16,976 --> 00:01:20,016
I think making one each is a good idea.

18
00:01:21,646 --> 00:01:23,886
How about we do this, Yo Han, A Sung?

19
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,986
(How?)

20
00:01:27,126 --> 00:01:28,625
Just for fun,

21
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:31,125
we could do our own "Culinary Class Wars."

22
00:01:31,126 --> 00:01:32,225
(Are you up for that, Si A?)

23
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:33,695
That could be more fun.

24
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,726
Right?

25
00:01:35,266 --> 00:01:36,636
(Coming soon)

26
00:01:36,866 --> 00:01:38,096
(How many minutes do we have?)

27
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:40,736
(I don't know if this is right.)

28
00:01:40,866 --> 00:01:42,465
(I think soon, )

29
00:01:42,466 --> 00:01:44,376
(you'll tell me to get out of your face.)

30
00:01:45,676 --> 00:01:47,676
(Our Own Cooking Battle, Mini Culinary Class Wars)

31
00:01:48,046 --> 00:01:49,545
(The first participant)

32
00:01:49,546 --> 00:01:52,176
(Country Cook 3-Star A Sung)

33
00:01:54,486 --> 00:01:57,986
(Excellent technique, 1 star)

34
00:01:58,086 --> 00:01:59,886
(Understanding customer preferences, 2 stars)

35
00:01:59,926 --> 00:02:02,826
(Experience working under Eddie, 3 stars)

36
00:02:03,556 --> 00:02:04,755
(A strong contender, Country Cook 3-Star)

37
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:06,056
(I'm getting 1st place.)

38
00:02:06,296 --> 00:02:07,765
(The second participant)

39
00:02:07,766 --> 00:02:09,426
(Foodie Si A)

40
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:14,036
(I sincerely love food.)

41
00:02:15,366 --> 00:02:18,436
(One who knows how to eat also knows how to cook.)

42
00:02:19,336 --> 00:02:22,275
(She was born with a tasty spoon in her mouth.)

43
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,356
(A naturally talented cook)

44
00:02:23,516 --> 00:02:24,815
(A naturally talented cook, Foodie Si A)

45
00:02:24,816 --> 00:02:26,092
(I'll get ahead as much as I eat.)

46
00:02:26,116 --> 00:02:27,686
(And the last participant)

47
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:30,686
(If Chef tells me to, I should!)

48
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:32,016
Kyun.

49
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:34,286
(Kyun's right-hand man, Yo Han)

50
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:39,226
(I'll show off the cooking skills I've been hiding until now.)

51
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:41,595
(Eddie's right-hand man, Cooking Master Yo Han)

52
00:02:41,596 --> 00:02:43,796
(I'm the dark horse today.)

53
00:02:44,396 --> 00:02:47,106
(In 60 minutes, finish a dish for Edward Lee!)

54
00:02:48,066 --> 00:02:51,836
(Who will be the final winner?)

55
00:02:54,076 --> 00:02:55,646
(Edward Lee's Country Cook)

56
00:02:56,206 --> 00:02:57,875
(The 3 Country members are on their way...)

57
00:02:57,876 --> 00:02:59,836
(to get groceries for their cooking competition.)

58
00:03:00,616 --> 00:03:02,897
Are we going to put a time limit on grocery shopping too?

59
00:03:03,886 --> 00:03:05,256
(Look at this girl.)

60
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:07,485
- About 15 minutes?
- About 15 minutes?

61
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:08,785
- Let's do 20 minutes.
- Okay, 20 minutes.

62
00:03:08,786 --> 00:03:09,795
Okay, 20 minutes.

63
00:03:09,796 --> 00:03:12,526
Did you make a list of things you need to get?

64
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:13,866
Why do you want to know?

65
00:03:14,826 --> 00:03:15,826
(A Sung and Si A are immersed in the survival game.)

66
00:03:15,827 --> 00:03:17,496
I'm just curious.

67
00:03:17,636 --> 00:03:19,496
You really are so curious.

68
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,365
I'm doing that now.

69
00:03:21,366 --> 00:03:22,506
Thank you for reminding me.

70
00:03:24,136 --> 00:03:25,636
I shouldn't have said anything.

71
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:27,676
(You should've stayed quiet!)

72
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:29,405
(Laughing)

73
00:03:29,406 --> 00:03:31,176
Is this it? The grocery store?

74
00:03:31,646 --> 00:03:32,715
- Is it?
- I think so.

75
00:03:32,716 --> 00:03:34,915
(They arrived at the supermarket where they'll buy ingredients.)

76
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,285
Let's meet at the cashier...

77
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,715
by 5:20pm.

78
00:03:37,716 --> 00:03:38,786
- Okay.
- Let's go!

79
00:03:39,186 --> 00:03:40,625
(It's 4:55pm. They only have 20 minutes to shop.)

80
00:03:40,626 --> 00:03:41,956
You should grab a cart.

81
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:44,556
- Oh, right.
- Oh there they are.

82
00:03:45,796 --> 00:03:46,825
Oh, rice bread?

83
00:03:46,826 --> 00:03:47,866
(The players enter.)

84
00:03:48,326 --> 00:03:50,466
I'm suddenly blanking on what to buy.

85
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,106
(Meanwhile, A Sung gets going without any hesitation.)

86
00:03:54,966 --> 00:03:57,036
(She first grabs the pears that caught her eye.)

87
00:03:57,176 --> 00:03:58,706
(Next is silken tofu.)

88
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:00,545
(She quickly grabs eggs too!)

89
00:04:00,546 --> 00:04:01,846
(Oh, my.)

90
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:05,116
(I can't let them see me.)

91
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:07,385
(Pear, silken tofu, eggs)

92
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:08,886
(Is this it?)

93
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:11,185
I still have some time left until the 20 minutes is up.

94
00:04:11,186 --> 00:04:13,162
(A Sung is going for a simple but impactful dish.)

95
00:04:13,186 --> 00:04:14,285
(Si A is calmly shopping too.)

96
00:04:14,286 --> 00:04:17,096
Radish. I need to buy a radish.

97
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:20,026
One radish.

98
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,166
Should I buy a pack of wood ear mushrooms?

99
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:23,435
Nuts.

100
00:04:23,436 --> 00:04:25,236
(Unlike A Sung, Si A's cart is already full.)

101
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:27,482
(I got all of the vegetables. What else did I need...)

102
00:04:27,506 --> 00:04:28,535
(Right!)

103
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:29,666
The most important thing.

104
00:04:30,576 --> 00:04:31,636
Dried young pollack.

105
00:04:32,506 --> 00:04:34,146
Dried young pollack...

106
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:35,976
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

107
00:04:36,676 --> 00:04:37,815
Excuse me.

108
00:04:37,816 --> 00:04:39,145
(A Sung answered.)

109
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:40,216
- What?
- Yes?

110
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:41,615
- Nothing.
- If you need anything,

111
00:04:41,616 --> 00:04:43,115
- please let me know.
- I'm okay.

112
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,415
If you need anything,

113
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,285
- I'm okay.
- please let me know.

114
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,586
I'm okay.

115
00:04:47,786 --> 00:04:49,256
Oh, this is it.

116
00:04:49,326 --> 00:04:50,455
- This is it.
- Yes.

117
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,096
This is it. Thank you.

118
00:04:53,696 --> 00:04:55,496
I'll get two of these.

119
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:57,636
I got pollack roe.

120
00:04:58,496 --> 00:05:01,206
(Maximalist Si A will fight with quantity.)

121
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:02,436
Do you sell...

122
00:05:03,006 --> 00:05:04,536
pollack roe here?

123
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:06,575
(Yo Han is looking for pollack roe too.)

124
00:05:06,576 --> 00:05:09,276
- Pollack roe?
- There was no pollack roe.

125
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:11,476
- Really?
- Really.

126
00:05:12,376 --> 00:05:13,845
(Then what is this?)

127
00:05:13,846 --> 00:05:15,315
They're out of pollack roe.

128
00:05:15,316 --> 00:05:17,556
- Really?
- How unfortunate.

129
00:05:17,756 --> 00:05:19,216
Oh, how unfortunate.

130
00:05:20,056 --> 00:05:21,056
Excuse me.

131
00:05:21,686 --> 00:05:22,686
Excuse me.

132
00:05:23,596 --> 00:05:24,756
I have a question.

133
00:05:25,356 --> 00:05:26,696
Where is the pasta?

134
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:28,495
Between aisles 6 and 7.

135
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,666
Between 6 and 7? Thank you.

136
00:05:31,996 --> 00:05:33,812
(He grabbed green onions on the way to find pasta?)

137
00:05:33,836 --> 00:05:34,906
(And seaweed too?)

138
00:05:35,336 --> 00:05:37,436
(And butter too.)

139
00:05:39,136 --> 00:05:42,376
(Is he trying to beat Eddie, his teacher, in creativity?)

140
00:05:45,346 --> 00:05:47,415
(Pasta, the main ingredient, )

141
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,885
(and kimchi! A mysterious combination)

142
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,056
I think I'm done.

143
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:51,285
- Really?
- Yes.

144
00:05:51,286 --> 00:05:52,286
Me too.

145
00:05:53,856 --> 00:05:57,626
(What dishes will come out of these 3 sets of ingredients?)

146
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:02,565
(Mini Culinary Class Wars starts now.)

147
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:05,866
(Time limit, 60 minutes)

148
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,546
(A Sung and Si A first organize their ingredients.)

149
00:06:10,706 --> 00:06:13,276
Your dish seems pretty serious.

150
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:16,205
Why did we shop in secret if we were going to cook like this?

151
00:06:16,206 --> 00:06:18,646
Seriously. We all know now.

152
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,115
(Shall we get started?)

153
00:06:21,116 --> 00:06:22,286
Let's see...

154
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:24,756
(Oh, my!)

155
00:06:26,456 --> 00:06:29,056
(Si A carried over something quite heavy.)

156
00:06:30,526 --> 00:06:32,555
(Foodie Si A's main ingredient, dried young pollack)

157
00:06:32,556 --> 00:06:35,865
I thought about Korean food.

158
00:06:35,866 --> 00:06:40,135
I know how Chef Lee normally eats.

159
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:43,635
He likes to eat a variety.

160
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:45,736
He doesn't necessarily eat a lot.

161
00:06:45,836 --> 00:06:48,046
I wanted there to be...

162
00:06:48,506 --> 00:06:50,616
tanginess, sweetness, spiciness, and saltiness...

163
00:06:50,816 --> 00:06:53,586
all on one table together.

164
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:55,415
I decided to make mushroom sotbap...

165
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,445
(Foodie Si A's dish, Mushroom Sotbap)

166
00:06:56,446 --> 00:06:59,386
And braised pollack roe and dried young pollack.

167
00:07:01,086 --> 00:07:04,025
(Braised pollack roe and dried young pollack recipe)

168
00:07:04,026 --> 00:07:06,865
(1. Layer the bottom of the pot with radish slices...)

169
00:07:06,866 --> 00:07:07,896
Okay.

170
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:11,236
(And boil it over low heat.)

171
00:07:12,496 --> 00:07:14,905
(Braised pollack roe and dried young pollack recipe)

172
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:19,436
(2. Cut the dried young pollack into 2 pieces.)

173

(Dried young pollack)

174
00:07:23,446 --> 00:07:25,576
(Add the dried young pollack to the radish and cook!)

175
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:29,786
Yo Han. Do you have some green onion to spare?

176
00:07:30,056 --> 00:07:31,115
Why?

177
00:07:31,116 --> 00:07:32,986
It's just a question.

178
00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:35,255
- Do you have some left?
- I do.

179
00:07:35,256 --> 00:07:36,485
- Do you want it?
- Could I have some...

180
00:07:36,486 --> 00:07:38,226
I'll just take one.

181
00:07:38,326 --> 00:07:40,395
Aren't you being too nice?

182
00:07:40,396 --> 00:07:41,525
We're rivals right now.

183
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:42,826
He has good manners.

184
00:07:42,966 --> 00:07:47,205
But I'm pretty sure you'll need to get pollack roe from me.

185
00:07:47,206 --> 00:07:48,235
(Laughing)

186
00:07:48,236 --> 00:07:50,405
- So our relationship...
- I'm building up to that.

187
00:07:50,406 --> 00:07:52,176
- I see.
- is interesting.

188
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:54,946
Okay. Let's do this.

189
00:07:56,076 --> 00:07:57,775
Let's do this.

190
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:00,522
(Grabbing a handful of seasonings for the braised dried young pollack)

191
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:01,546
(Chili powder)

192
00:08:01,916 --> 00:08:02,916
(Soy sauce)

193
00:08:02,917 --> 00:08:04,015
(A genius doesn't need to measure.)

194
00:08:04,016 --> 00:08:05,055
(Fish sauce)

195
00:08:05,056 --> 00:08:06,456
(A genius doesn't need to measure.)

196
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:08,655
(Adding prepped vegetables...)

197
00:08:08,656 --> 00:08:10,456
(on top of the pollack with seasonings on it)

198
00:08:11,496 --> 00:08:15,325
(Time to simmer!)

199
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:16,736
Could you get some inserts?

200
00:08:17,266 --> 00:08:18,795
I learned this technique from Eddie.

201
00:08:18,796 --> 00:08:20,436
(Using a technique he learned from Eddie)

202
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:23,476
(He's just grating garlic on a grater.)

203
00:08:23,876 --> 00:08:26,516
(What is Yo Han, self-proclaimed Eddie's right-hand man, cooking?)

204
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:29,475
(Cooking Master Yo Han's main ingredient)

205
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,476
(Kimchi)

206
00:08:33,386 --> 00:08:36,315
I thought that Kyun really liked...

207
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:39,516
the combination of Western and Korean food.

208
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:42,626
Western noodles and Korean kimchi.

209
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,495
I named it, "Great Expectations."

210
00:08:45,496 --> 00:08:47,416
(Great Expectations, also known as kimchi pasta)

211
00:08:47,526 --> 00:08:49,926
(Pursing his lips in concentration)

212
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:52,965
(Making long slices of kimchi in the shape of pasta)

213
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,635
I made a bold move to make it hard to tell...

214
00:08:55,636 --> 00:08:56,906
between pasta and kimchi.

215
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,075
(Kimchi pasta recipe)

216
00:09:00,076 --> 00:09:02,406
(1. Cook minced garlic and green onion in oil.)

217
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:05,175
(Kimchi pasta recipe)

218
00:09:05,176 --> 00:09:08,646
(2. Stir-fry the kimchi sliced like noodles.)

219
00:09:10,056 --> 00:09:11,386
(Prowling)

220
00:09:11,556 --> 00:09:12,586
Look at that.

221
00:09:12,956 --> 00:09:14,985
- Could I try just one?
- What?

222
00:09:14,986 --> 00:09:17,196
- Could I try just one piece?
- Yes, go ahead.

223
00:09:17,826 --> 00:09:19,826
Look at how he sliced the kimchi.

224
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:21,496
It's like art.

225
00:09:22,466 --> 00:09:23,666
He's a master.

226
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:25,196
No.

227
00:09:27,066 --> 00:09:29,766
(They're all focused on the kimchi. How aged is it?)

228
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:35,975
You picked kimchi...

229
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,552
- that was appropriately aged.
- That's right.

230
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,015
What is the reason you picked kimchi...

231
00:09:39,016 --> 00:09:40,386
that was appropriately aged?

232
00:09:41,016 --> 00:09:43,616
I thought appropriately aged kimchi would be appropriately tasty.

233
00:09:43,656 --> 00:09:44,686
I see.

234
00:09:45,186 --> 00:09:47,456
(Meanwhile, Si A steals a piece of the kimchi.)

235
00:09:48,786 --> 00:09:49,985
What do you think...

236
00:09:49,986 --> 00:09:51,956
is the virtue of appropriateness?

237
00:09:52,256 --> 00:09:53,772
- The virtue of appropriateness?
- Yes.

238
00:09:53,796 --> 00:09:55,726
It keeps you from hating each other.

239
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:56,965
(That's right.)

240
00:09:56,966 --> 00:09:58,195
Appropriateness is love.

241
00:09:58,196 --> 00:09:59,996
"Appropriateness is love."

242
00:10:00,636 --> 00:10:01,666
That's a great quote.

243
00:10:02,136 --> 00:10:04,506
- Oh, my. You're cleaning a fish.
- Yes.

244
00:10:04,836 --> 00:10:06,905
Do you often clean fish?

245
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:07,945
I do,

246
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:09,505
but I'm really regretting it right now.

247
00:10:09,506 --> 00:10:12,316
So I don't want you to talk to me too much.

248
00:10:12,476 --> 00:10:14,585
This really was a mistake.

249
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:15,615
(Foodie Si A runs away.)

250
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:18,215
I think soon, you'll tell me...

251
00:10:18,216 --> 00:10:19,915
- to get out of your face.
- No.

252
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,955
- Right now...
- Should I stick around a bit more?

253
00:10:21,956 --> 00:10:24,296
You keep bullying me.

254
00:10:24,356 --> 00:10:25,426
I'll allow it.

255
00:10:25,896 --> 00:10:28,165
- Okay.
- Please help me out.

256
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,225
(Report Ko A Sung is done for the day.)

257
00:10:29,226 --> 00:10:30,596
Are you done, A Sung?

258
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:33,236
She's not rushed at all.

259
00:10:34,106 --> 00:10:36,205
(I have a plan.)

260
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:40,146
(Time limit, 60 minutes)

261
00:10:40,346 --> 00:10:41,875
(Foodie Si A starts on her second dish, )

262
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:43,275
(mushroom sotbap.)

263
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,016
(All over the place)

264
00:10:45,746 --> 00:10:46,746
(Turning the water on)

265
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:47,886
(Turning it off)

266
00:10:48,986 --> 00:10:49,986
(Turning it on)

267
00:10:49,987 --> 00:10:51,216
(Turning it off)

268
00:10:52,116 --> 00:10:53,386
(Is something wrong?)

269
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:56,725
I could've just served him plain rice.

270
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:59,726
But I wanted to serve him the best rice.

271
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,066
So I thought, "Let's try making sotbap."

272
00:11:03,366 --> 00:11:05,836
(But there was one issue.)

273
00:11:06,296 --> 00:11:08,435
(Si A has never made sotbap before.)

274
00:11:08,436 --> 00:11:09,565
I was even more focused...

275
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:12,236
than I was during my college entrance exam.

276
00:11:12,536 --> 00:11:15,105
You actually have to measure,

277
00:11:15,106 --> 00:11:17,745
but I didn't know where the measuring cups were,

278
00:11:17,746 --> 00:11:19,015
and I had no time,

279
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:21,145
so I just eyeballed the amount of water.

280
00:11:21,146 --> 00:11:23,386
(Eyeballing sotbap, a difficult recipe)

281
00:11:23,886 --> 00:11:26,216
(Are you okay, Si A?)

282
00:11:28,586 --> 00:11:30,426
I'm really going on intuition.

283
00:11:31,896 --> 00:11:34,926
(Filling the pot with shiitake and wood ear mushrooms)

284
00:11:35,426 --> 00:11:37,936
(Now, controlling the heat is key!)

285
00:11:38,466 --> 00:11:39,466
(But)

286
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:40,466
(Switching off)

287
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:41,906
(She just turned the stove off.)

288
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:43,536
Yo Han.

289
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,935
- Did you turn the stove off?
- Yes.

290
00:11:44,936 --> 00:11:46,505
- Are you ruining your dish?
- Give it to me.

291
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:47,905
Give it to me.

292
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:49,245
- Show me, Yo Han.
- Here.

293
00:11:49,246 --> 00:11:51,516
I need to control the heat because I'm making rice.

294
00:11:51,816 --> 00:11:53,375
(Forgetting about the competition and working together)

295
00:11:53,376 --> 00:11:54,615
About this much. Look.

296
00:11:54,616 --> 00:11:55,816
- Okay.
- About this much.

297
00:11:57,156 --> 00:11:58,255
Thank you.

298
00:11:58,256 --> 00:11:59,776
(Will Si A's mushroom sotbap be okay?)

299
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,356
- Oh, my.
- Are you okay?

300
00:12:02,726 --> 00:12:04,226
Yes, I'm totally fine.

301
00:12:05,356 --> 00:12:07,276
(Not forgetting to grab some salted pollack roe)

302
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:09,642
(Adding salted pollack roe to the braised dried young pollack)

303
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,496
(Si A is calmly finishing up her dishes.)

304
00:12:13,096 --> 00:12:15,636
(How will Si A's dishes turn out?)

305
00:12:16,806 --> 00:12:19,506
(Meanwhile, Yo Han gets started on the main part.)

306
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:22,346
(Spreading the noodles out)

307
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:25,676
(He added pasta into a pan without much water.)

308
00:12:27,246 --> 00:12:30,686
(This noodle has reached the end of its life.)

309
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,256
(Oh, right. Water.)

310
00:12:34,026 --> 00:12:37,256
(That's how his magical cooking began.)

311
00:12:39,256 --> 00:12:41,165
(He picked out the burnt pasta...)

312
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,296
(and casually added new pasta.)

313
00:12:45,136 --> 00:12:47,366
(And one more magical ingredient!)

314
00:12:47,606 --> 00:12:52,476
(The collaboration of uncooked pasta and coin broth?)

315
00:12:54,246 --> 00:12:58,276
(Abracadabra. Turn into a tasty dish.)

316
00:12:59,446 --> 00:13:00,715
How much pollack roe do you need?

317
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:02,015
What? You can use it.

318
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,915
- How much do you need?
- I only need a little.

319
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,185
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

320
00:13:05,186 --> 00:13:07,066
- You can grab a little later.
- Yes, go ahead.

321
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:09,685
Are you on one team?

322
00:13:09,686 --> 00:13:11,495
- No.
- Without me?

323
00:13:11,496 --> 00:13:13,396
I'm sorry, but it turned out that way.

324
00:13:13,556 --> 00:13:16,825
- Because you...
- Did I joke around too much?

325
00:13:16,826 --> 00:13:18,965
- I'm sorry.
- You kept teasing us.

326
00:13:18,966 --> 00:13:21,305
You seemed so much at ease.

327
00:13:21,306 --> 00:13:22,306
I know what you mean. It's annoying to see someone...

328
00:13:22,306 --> 00:13:23,306
who is so relaxed when you're feeling rushed.

329
00:13:23,307 --> 00:13:25,736
Yes, I'm really upset.

330
00:13:26,036 --> 00:13:28,346
- Yes, I was upset too.
- Yes, really upset.

331
00:13:29,446 --> 00:13:32,746
(Meanwhile, Eddie is back from the big family meal.)

332
00:13:33,316 --> 00:13:34,915
Okay.

333
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:37,056
(Working hard, unaware that Eddie is back)

334
00:13:38,156 --> 00:13:40,756
(And someone is still taking it slow.)

335
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:44,056
Hello?

336
00:13:44,656 --> 00:13:45,696
Yo Han.

337
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:47,865
(Where are they hiding?)

338
00:13:47,866 --> 00:13:48,896
No.

339
00:13:49,666 --> 00:13:50,735
Where are they?

340
00:13:50,736 --> 00:13:52,536
(Where did you all go?)

341
00:13:53,906 --> 00:13:56,506
(I had a tiring day.)

342
00:13:59,836 --> 00:14:02,246
(Oh, it's Kyun!)

343
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:03,676
Hello?

344
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,476
- Yo Han.
- Yes.

345
00:14:05,546 --> 00:14:06,876
It is Edward.

346
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,046
- How are you?
- Did you do well?

347
00:14:09,316 --> 00:14:10,585
Yes, I did well.

348
00:14:10,586 --> 00:14:12,586
- Kyun. Where are you right now?
- Yes?

349
00:14:12,956 --> 00:14:14,626
I'm in our room.

350
00:14:14,726 --> 00:14:15,926
Get some rest.

351
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,656
Okay. What are you doing?

352
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:20,096
We're just...

353
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:21,566
Exercising.

354
00:14:21,596 --> 00:14:22,825
We're playing table tennis.

355
00:14:22,826 --> 00:14:24,736
Table tennis? Okay.

356
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:26,736
Okay. Get some rest.

357
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,006
- Okay.
- Okay.

358
00:14:28,866 --> 00:14:32,536
(Eddie gets some rest in the warm room.)

359
00:14:33,376 --> 00:14:34,745
Oh, gosh.

360
00:14:34,746 --> 00:14:36,506
The time is going by so darn quickly.

361
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:39,676
(Time limit, 60 minutes)

362
00:14:40,386 --> 00:14:42,546
(A Sung, who was taking it slow, finally gets going.)

363
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:44,656
(Ramyeon?)

364
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:46,156
(This is the stuff.)

365
00:14:46,456 --> 00:14:48,226
(Only grabbing the soup packet)

366
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:51,425
(What is she making with the ramyeon soup packet?)

367
00:14:51,426 --> 00:14:54,726
I make this dish very often.

368
00:14:54,826 --> 00:14:56,766
I can't eat really spicy food.

369
00:14:56,966 --> 00:14:58,395
So when I make ramyeon,

370
00:14:58,396 --> 00:15:01,666
I always tend to leave...

371
00:15:01,766 --> 00:15:03,936
about a third or a quarter of the soup packet.

372
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:08,105
I was trying to think of a way to use what was left...

373
00:15:08,106 --> 00:15:10,446
and ended up developing this recipe.

374
00:15:11,376 --> 00:15:15,145
It's a tofu dish with a mild flavor, so I named it "Mild Tofu."

375
00:15:15,146 --> 00:15:16,986
(Country Cook 3-Star A Sung's dish, Mild Tofu)

376
00:15:17,156 --> 00:15:19,015
(The combination of mild tofu...)

377
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:21,226
(and intense ramyeon seasoning?)

378
00:15:23,026 --> 00:15:24,026
(Mild Tofu recipe)

379
00:15:24,027 --> 00:15:25,755
(1. Cut silken tofu into bite-sized pieces.)

380
00:15:25,756 --> 00:15:28,665
Ramyeon seasoning, sesame oil, soy sauce, sesame seeds,

381
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:30,965
a little bit of oyster sauce, and minced garlic.

382
00:15:30,966 --> 00:15:32,066
(Mild Tofu recipe)

383
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,166
And I noticed one thing...

384
00:15:35,336 --> 00:15:37,975
while spending time with Chef Lee.

385
00:15:37,976 --> 00:15:41,706
Chef Lee really likes dishes with fruit in them.

386
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:44,616
(On the first day, he made chimichurri with lemon.)

387
00:15:44,846 --> 00:15:47,316
(Last night, he made hotteok with strawberries inside.)

388
00:15:47,786 --> 00:15:50,046
(She saw and tasted Eddie's love for fruit.)

389
00:15:50,486 --> 00:15:52,055
(Fruit is the best supporter!)

390
00:15:52,056 --> 00:15:54,285
So it was my first attempt,

391
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:57,555
but I saw him enjoy the pear at the Head House today,

392
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:00,296
so I thought about adding pear.

393
00:16:00,696 --> 00:16:04,536
(She catches his preferences, like the good student she is.)

394
00:16:07,536 --> 00:16:12,276
(3. Blend the pear and mix into the sauce.)

395
00:16:19,816 --> 00:16:21,616
(How does it taste?)

396
00:16:21,716 --> 00:16:23,886
(Someone praise me.)

397
00:16:25,616 --> 00:16:27,185
(Next, she needs...)

398
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:29,655
(a pot...)

399
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,095
(and cooking oil?)

400
00:16:31,096 --> 00:16:32,795
We have sweet and salty,

401
00:16:32,796 --> 00:16:34,225
but we don't have cold and hot.

402
00:16:34,226 --> 00:16:35,926
That makes me so sad.

403
00:16:36,066 --> 00:16:37,235
There's something so satisfying about eating...

404
00:16:37,236 --> 00:16:39,866
something cold and something hot at the same time.

405
00:16:41,636 --> 00:16:44,436
(A Sung's proposal, cold and hot)

406
00:16:47,306 --> 00:16:48,545
Boil cooking oil.

407
00:16:48,546 --> 00:16:50,266
(Add a generous amount of oil and boil it.)

408
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,416
(Carefully adjusting the heat is a must.)

409
00:16:53,816 --> 00:16:54,816
(Glancing over)

410
00:16:55,286 --> 00:16:56,716
(Is the oil boiling?)

411
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,915
(Then drop in a piece of scallion!)

412
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,655
When the cooking oil really starts to bubble...

413
00:17:02,656 --> 00:17:03,872
(A Sung's tip, When the oil starts to bubble...)

414
00:17:03,896 --> 00:17:05,826
Pour the cooking oil on top of the sauce...

415
00:17:05,996 --> 00:17:08,026
so that only the outside burns slightly.

416
00:17:08,496 --> 00:17:11,036
Then it becomes a Chinese-style sauce...

417
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:12,995
with an exotic flavor.

418
00:17:12,996 --> 00:17:17,505
Then pour that on top of soft, cold tofu.

419
00:17:17,506 --> 00:17:20,036
(Pour hot sauce over cold tofu.)

420
00:17:21,546 --> 00:17:24,116
(Add an egg yolk for richness and creaminess!)

421
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:26,215
(Sprinkle on some chopped scallions for decoration!)

422
00:17:26,216 --> 00:17:27,586
That looks delicious.

423
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:32,886

I didn't imagine that bell, right?

427
00:17:41,096 --> 00:17:43,026
(I haven't even finished one dish yet.)

(Nervous)

433
00:17:54,746 --> 00:17:56,145
- Oh, my.
- Is it super delicious?

434
00:17:56,146 --> 00:17:57,246
I'm a genius.

435
00:17:57,376 --> 00:17:58,776
A Sung. The rice...

436
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:01,586
is just perfect.

437
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:03,462
- How did you make it so well?
- The rice is perfect.

438
00:18:03,486 --> 00:18:05,062
Yo Han. Do you want a taste of the sotbap?

439
00:18:05,086 --> 00:18:06,855
This is insane. Why is it so good?

440
00:18:06,856 --> 00:18:08,356
- Oh, my.
- It's perfect.

441
00:18:08,656 --> 00:18:10,155
- Why is this? Wood ear mushroom?
- I'm so relieved.

442
00:18:10,156 --> 00:18:11,795
- Wood ear mushroom and shiitake.
- That's so delicious.

443
00:18:11,796 --> 00:18:12,825
(The rice is infused with the aroma of wood ear mushroom and shiitake.)

448
00:18:21,036 --> 00:18:22,805
- I'm so relieved.
- Just the rice is so delicious.

449
00:18:22,806 --> 00:18:24,035
I'm really so relieved.

450

451
00:18:25,806 --> 00:18:28,406

- I put it back in place.
- Oh, I see.

460

496

498
00:20:44,816 --> 00:20:47,115
they'd just tell me that it tasted good.

499
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:49,786
So I gave them some and left. And then I heard someone say,

500
00:20:50,116 --> 00:20:51,985
"This would taste good with rice."

501
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,346

503
00:20:56,286 --> 00:20:59,056

- Slice some strawberries?
- Yes, strawberries.

518

Into a good size so it's still chunky.

519
00:21:34,026 --> 00:21:36,366

- Okay.

00:22:16,673 --> 00:22:18,312
About six?

539
00:22:18,313 --> 00:22:19,313
Oh, my.

540
00:22:19,314 --> 00:22:20,812
(What is this?)

541
00:22:20,813 --> 00:22:21,883
This is a disaster!

542
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:24,483
(An exclusive!)

543
00:22:24,853 --> 00:22:26,622
This is a disaster!

544
00:22:26,623 --> 00:22:28,252
- What do we do?
- This is really a disaster.

545
00:22:28,253 --> 00:22:30,173
(All the water evaporated and the pot is burnt.)

546
00:22:30,593 --> 00:22:32,222
No. This can't be happening.

547
00:22:32,223 --> 00:22:34,063
What is it?

548
00:22:34,293 --> 00:22:35,433
- This is...
- Gosh.

549
00:22:35,533 --> 00:22:37,309
- a total disaster.
- I can smell the burnt pot.

550
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:38,702
(The smell is so strong.)

551
00:22:38,703 --> 00:22:40,263
No, we can save this.

552
00:22:40,503 --> 00:22:41,503
You got this, Si A.

553
00:22:41,504 --> 00:22:43,033
I'll just scoop out whatever I can.

554
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:45,543
Gosh, doing multiple things at once is hard.

555
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:48,312
Why don't we move the food into a different pot with some water?

556
00:22:48,313 --> 00:22:50,442
- Yes. Just boil that and...
- Yes.

557
00:22:50,443 --> 00:22:52,583
- Yes, that much.
- We'll continue cooking in that.

558
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:53,883
Guys.

559
00:22:53,884 --> 00:22:55,112
Wait, let me try it first.

560
00:22:55,113 --> 00:22:56,412
Right. Take a bite and let me know.

561
00:22:56,413 --> 00:22:57,682
- Whether to cook it right away...
- If it tastes similar...

562
00:22:57,683 --> 00:22:58,723
Okay.

563
00:23:00,223 --> 00:23:01,253
Just be calm.

564
00:23:06,793 --> 00:23:07,893
It's good.

565
00:23:08,133 --> 00:23:09,963
- Is it?
- Yes, it tastes good.

566
00:23:10,233 --> 00:23:11,603
You're in a better mood.

567
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:15,533
I feel like this is fine.

568
00:23:15,803 --> 00:23:18,602
Only the part on the outside was burnt.

569
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:22,343
So thankfully, none of the dried young pollack was burnt.

570
00:23:22,713 --> 00:23:24,812
(Foodie Si A's pride is hurt.)

571
00:23:24,813 --> 00:23:26,242
Please don't film this.

572
00:23:26,243 --> 00:23:27,882
(She's refusing to be filmed.)

573
00:23:27,883 --> 00:23:29,153
Don't film this.

574
00:23:29,953 --> 00:23:31,153
Don't film this.

575
00:23:32,183 --> 00:23:33,753
You're tarnishing...

576
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:36,423
my reputation.

577
00:23:37,593 --> 00:23:38,722
Thank you.

578
00:23:38,723 --> 00:23:39,992
- Are you done?
- You go ahead.

579
00:23:39,993 --> 00:23:41,863
I'm perfect. Thank you so much.

580
00:23:42,493 --> 00:23:43,832
I'm going to eat one.

581
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,933
(They eat strawberries to calm themselves down.)

582
00:23:48,503 --> 00:23:49,932
The strawberries are so good.

583
00:23:49,933 --> 00:23:51,973
(Now, let's finish up making pickled strawberries.)

584
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:53,672
(Sour vinegar, nutty perilla oil, )

585
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:55,873
A little bit of perilla oil.

586
00:23:56,543 --> 00:23:57,812
(and spicy chili powder)

587
00:23:57,813 --> 00:23:58,983
It smells great.

588
00:23:59,143 --> 00:24:00,183
- Really?
- Yes.

589
00:24:01,883 --> 00:24:04,423
(Si A's idea created the pickled strawberries, plum, celtuce.)

590
00:24:05,483 --> 00:24:07,583
(Foodie Si A, Special Meal)

591
00:24:08,023 --> 00:24:09,953
- All right.
- All done.

592
00:24:10,593 --> 00:24:11,793
I'm the last one to finish.

593
00:24:13,163 --> 00:24:17,563
(What will Eddie say to the three Country members?)

594
00:24:17,863 --> 00:24:19,602
(After the fierce cooking was over)

595
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:21,803
I'm excited.

596
00:24:22,403 --> 00:24:23,433
Eddie.

597
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:26,003
Come over here!

598
00:24:28,073 --> 00:24:31,343
(Eddie has gone to sleep after an especially grueling day.)

599
00:24:31,643 --> 00:24:34,383
(Sleeping soundly)

600
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:36,313
Did you have a good time?

601
00:24:36,783 --> 00:24:37,882
What happened?

602
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:39,223
We made food.

603
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,353
- Who?
- All three of us.

604
00:24:41,693 --> 00:24:43,122
- Really?
- Yes.

605
00:24:43,123 --> 00:24:45,093
- Why?
- For you.

606
00:24:45,263 --> 00:24:47,792
So you have to taste it...

607
00:24:47,793 --> 00:24:48,962
and give evaluations.

608
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:50,093
- Really?
- Yes.

609
00:24:50,533 --> 00:24:53,462
(Eddie bursts into laughter at the unexpected news.)

610
00:24:53,463 --> 00:24:54,572
- Right now?
- Yes, right now.

611
00:24:54,573 --> 00:24:55,773
- We have to go.
- I'm hungry.

612
00:24:55,803 --> 00:24:58,503
(I'm hungry, so let's go.)

613
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:00,642
Wait, what did you make?

614
00:25:00,643 --> 00:25:01,913
You'll know when you get there.

615
00:25:02,973 --> 00:25:06,313
(The three of them made dishes that are as different as they are.)

(Edward Lee, judge and former guest chef for White House State Dinner)

631
00:25:36,214 --> 00:25:37,273
Hello.

632
00:25:38,543 --> 00:25:39,713
What happened?

(Attention-grabbing)

634
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,253
Hello.

635
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:47,053
- I'll put the dishes here.
- Okay.

636
00:25:47,283 --> 00:25:48,323
Gosh.

637
00:25:48,853 --> 00:25:50,022
- Here?
- Yes.

638
00:25:50,023 --> 00:25:51,362
(His eyes are glued.)

639
00:25:51,363 --> 00:25:53,523
Gosh, I don't know whose this is, but it's very heavy.

640
00:25:56,063 --> 00:25:57,193
Gosh, is that roe?

641
00:25:57,593 --> 00:25:58,763
Steamed roe?

642
00:26:01,063 --> 00:26:02,733
Do I not get to know who made what?

643
00:26:03,173 --> 00:26:04,332
- It's a secret.
- No.

644
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,372
A secret. I see.

645
00:26:05,373 --> 00:26:07,279

(The die has been cast.)

00:26:18,853 --> 00:26:20,052
(The first dish is A Sung's Mild Tofu, )

652
00:26:20,053 --> 00:26:21,893
(a strong contender.)

653
00:26:22,223 --> 00:26:24,663
If I had to guess who would win, it's me.

654
00:26:24,923 --> 00:26:26,193
I would be in first place.

655
00:26:28,263 --> 00:26:30,362
(The charm of cold and hot)

656
00:26:30,363 --> 00:26:32,323
(Mild Tofu is topped with a Chinese-style sauce.)

657

I don't know who made that, but the person was brilliant.

658
00:26:35,503 --> 00:26:37,603
Yes, the person really was brilliant.

659
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:38,803
Let's see.

660
00:26:39,903 --> 00:26:43,213
(What will Eddie think about it?)

661
00:26:47,143 --> 00:26:49,453
(His facial expression is...)

662
00:26:49,613 --> 00:26:51,653
(Does he not like it?)

663
00:26:55,193 --> 00:26:56,623
What is this flavor?

664
00:27:00,463 --> 00:27:03,233
(It's hard to tell what Eddie's facial expression means.)

665
00:27:04,833 --> 00:27:05,903
I don't know what the...

666
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:08,203
(Her competition is smiling.)

667
00:27:08,573 --> 00:27:10,493
This must be his first time tasting that flavor.

668
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:14,203
I was very flustered.

669
00:27:14,643 --> 00:27:16,313
I've made that dish so many times,

670
00:27:16,573 --> 00:27:17,943
but I was so anxious.

671
00:27:18,783 --> 00:27:20,512
(Is the charming combination of...)

672
00:27:20,513 --> 00:27:22,513
(cold tofu and hot sauce not working?)

673
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:24,882
There's an egg in here too.

674
00:27:24,883 --> 00:27:26,753
(He found something.)

675
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:30,222
(It's an egg yolk, A Sung's last winning move.)

676
00:27:30,223 --> 00:27:31,993
(Egg yolk, I have faith in you.)

677
00:27:34,063 --> 00:27:38,133
(How will Mild Tofu taste with the egg yolk?)

678
00:27:39,303 --> 00:27:40,932
At first, the flavor was strange.

679
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:43,232
(He said it tasted strange.)

680
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,903
But the more I keep eating...

681
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:48,142
(The more you keep eating?)

682
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:50,543
I didn't expect how anxious...

683
00:27:51,143 --> 00:27:52,813
and nervous I would be.

684
00:27:54,783 --> 00:27:56,613
I like it.

685
00:27:56,683 --> 00:27:58,383
(A Sung smiles wide in relief.)

686
00:27:59,323 --> 00:28:01,182
It's me. I'll be in first place.

687
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:03,153
(I'll be taking home first place.)

688
00:28:04,253 --> 00:28:05,792
(Contender number 2 is nervous...)

689
00:28:05,793 --> 00:28:07,463
(about the unexpected positive feedback.)

00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:10,933
(He's the original master of noodle-shaped kimchi.)

691
00:28:11,803 --> 00:28:14,283
(He had everyone in awe with his waterless cooking technique.)

(Butter)

(Kimchi juice)

695
00:28:18,803 --> 00:28:19,873
(Coin broth)

696
00:28:21,073 --> 00:28:24,843
(The second dish is Yo Han's Great Expectations.)

697
00:28:25,113 --> 00:28:27,243
I'm not sure who made it, but it looks tasty.

698
00:28:29,713 --> 00:28:31,183
- Be quiet.
- There's a twist.

699
00:28:31,283 --> 00:28:32,423
No, it's fine.

700
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,053
(Yum)

701
00:28:35,453 --> 00:28:37,593
(That's a favoratble reaction.)

702
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:40,392
Spaghetti with pollack roe?

703
00:28:40,393 --> 00:28:41,933
(Spaghetti with pollack roe?)

704
00:28:44,193 --> 00:28:46,233
(Yo Han's mouth is dry.)

705
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:47,763
Tofu?

706
00:28:49,803 --> 00:28:50,803
Yes.

707
00:28:50,804 --> 00:28:51,902
(Before he knew it, Yo Han answered Eddie's question.)

708
00:28:51,903 --> 00:28:53,502
- It might not be tofu.
- Is it tofu?

709
00:28:53,503 --> 00:28:55,183
I thought I heard someone say it was tofu.

710
00:28:55,743 --> 00:28:56,973
Where is that person?

711
00:28:57,073 --> 00:28:58,443
The person can't be found.

712
00:29:00,183 --> 00:29:01,183
It's spicy.

713
00:29:02,013 --> 00:29:04,183
(It's spicy?)

714
00:29:04,553 --> 00:29:06,052
- It's spicy?
- It must be a little spicy for him.

715
00:29:06,053 --> 00:29:07,813
(Does that mean the dish is in third place?)

716
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:10,392
But it's nicely spicy.

717
00:29:10,393 --> 00:29:11,592
(Another twist)

718
00:29:11,593 --> 00:29:14,023
Very nice. The texture of the spaghetti is perfect.

719
00:29:14,123 --> 00:29:15,562
(I'm such a good cook.)

720
00:29:15,563 --> 00:29:18,162
I feel like Edward found what he was looking for.

721
00:29:18,163 --> 00:29:22,072
(He's getting carried away.)

722
00:29:22,073 --> 00:29:24,843
A sense of nostalgia that goes beyond flavor.

723
00:29:26,273 --> 00:29:27,472
(Cooking Master Yo Han is...)

724
00:29:27,473 --> 00:29:29,143
(a self-proclaimed strong contender.)

725
00:29:29,813 --> 00:29:31,112
(And the final contender is Foodie Si A.)

726
00:29:31,113 --> 00:29:33,813
I think I was very nervous on the inside.

727
00:29:35,083 --> 00:29:38,223
(This was her first time making mushroom sotbap.)

728
00:29:39,623 --> 00:29:41,552
(And she was barely able to salvage...)

729
00:29:41,553 --> 00:29:43,923
(the braised pollack roe and dried young pollack.)

730
00:29:45,693 --> 00:29:47,792
(Finally, the pickled strawberries, plum, celtuce...)

731
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:49,663
(that she thought of and created on the spot)

732
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:54,333
(Si A's Special Meal)

733
00:29:54,733 --> 00:29:57,203
I feel like that's a meal of...

734
00:29:57,373 --> 00:29:58,843
foods that complement each other.

735
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:04,343
(First, he takes a bite of the braised dried young pollack.)

736
00:30:07,943 --> 00:30:10,182
(He mixes the sauce into the pot rice...)

737
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,283
(and takes a bite of the rice, as well.)

738
00:30:12,553 --> 00:30:13,652
He's chewing.

739
00:30:13,653 --> 00:30:16,152
(He seems to be enjoying the food.)

740
00:30:16,153 --> 00:30:17,753
Gosh.

741
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:22,063
(Eddie isn't putting down his spoon.)

742
00:30:24,293 --> 00:30:25,503
Is this dried pollack?

743
00:30:26,303 --> 00:30:27,363
Pardon?

744
00:30:27,903 --> 00:30:29,103
What is it?

745
00:30:29,133 --> 00:30:30,532
(Someone tell him it's dried young pollack for me.)

746
00:30:30,533 --> 00:30:32,042
- I think it's dried young pollack.
- It's dried pollack.

747
00:30:32,043 --> 00:30:34,002
Dried young pollack.

748
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:36,073
(The blind tasting is strictly fair for everyone.)

749
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:38,613
(It's dried young pollack.)

750
00:30:39,183 --> 00:30:40,183
Almonds?

751
00:30:40,184 --> 00:30:42,852
(Next, he tries the pickled strawberries, plum, celtuce.)

752
00:30:42,853 --> 00:30:44,183
- Strawberries?
- How is it?

753
00:30:44,413 --> 00:30:46,053
(Eddie didn't hear him.)

754
00:30:48,423 --> 00:30:50,993
(The pickled strawberries, plum, celtuce has Eddie mesmerized.)

755
00:30:51,593 --> 00:30:53,592
(It's a unique combination of different ingredients.)

756
00:30:53,593 --> 00:30:56,133
(One can't help but be curious about its flavor.)

757
00:30:58,263 --> 00:30:59,703
(Yum)

758
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:02,973
Okay.

759
00:31:04,773 --> 00:31:07,502
(At this point, he's just having dinner.)

760
00:31:07,503 --> 00:31:09,072
(Why is he digging into this dish in particular?)

761
00:31:09,073 --> 00:31:10,572
He must have been very hungry.

762
00:31:10,573 --> 00:31:12,512
I think he was starving.

763
00:31:12,513 --> 00:31:13,582
- Eddie.
- Yes.

764
00:31:13,583 --> 00:31:16,153
What do you think about the flavor? Is it good?

765
00:31:17,113 --> 00:31:18,553
Why are you eating the food?

766
00:31:19,353 --> 00:31:20,382
(Why are you eating the food without saying anything?)

767
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:22,553
- Maybe you could explain...
- I'm hungry.

768
00:31:22,893 --> 00:31:24,992
And meet our eyes too.

769
00:31:24,993 --> 00:31:26,792
I just...

770
00:31:26,793 --> 00:31:27,992
(Si A is grateful that he likes her food, but it's kind of funny.)

771
00:31:27,993 --> 00:31:29,263
haven't eaten anything all day.

772
00:31:29,433 --> 00:31:30,692
This is my favorite.

773
00:31:30,693 --> 00:31:34,163
(Eddie's first choice, pickled plums with strawberries and celtuce)

774
00:31:34,703 --> 00:31:36,533
This is what touched me.

775
00:31:36,673 --> 00:31:38,803
I thought that he'd take 1 or 2 bites.

776
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:41,872
Instead, he really enjoyed what I made.

777
00:31:41,873 --> 00:31:43,073
He was really into it.

778
00:31:43,643 --> 00:31:44,913
I was touched.

779
00:31:45,183 --> 00:31:46,712
I didn't just feel proud of myself.

780
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:49,753
It made me feel emotional.

781
00:31:50,253 --> 00:31:52,483
Please evaluate starting from the second place.

782
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:56,693
("I've never tasted such a surprising charm.")

783
00:31:57,393 --> 00:32:00,663
("The texture of the pasta is perfect.")

784
00:32:01,123 --> 00:32:04,933
("I can't stop eating it.")

785
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:10,003
(Who will be the final winner of Mini Culinary Class Wars?)

786
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:15,380
(Who will be the final winner of Mini Culinary Class Wars?)

787
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:17,380
I can't decide.

788
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:19,650
I like all of them.

789
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:22,289
But you have to judge...

790
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,419
(We have to decide who gets to wash the dishes.)

791
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,560
You made this one.

792
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,530
- That's right.
- I know you.

793
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,230
You have a big appetite.

794
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,600
You're very generous.

795
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,029
When I saw it, I thought, "That's Si A."

796
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:35,046
(As soon as he saw the amount, he knew that it was Foodie Si A's.)

797
00:32:35,070 --> 00:32:36,100
You're right.

798
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,410
It was really interesting to see all three dishes.

799
00:32:39,870 --> 00:32:42,680
Very bright, simple,

800
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:46,110
and full of flavor but not too salty.

801
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:49,280
- Yo Han, you made the pasta.
- Yes?

802
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,750
I love this.

803
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,510
- Thank you.
- The pasta was very good.

804
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,389
The pasta dish could have gone either way.

805
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:59,389
But again, it had this feeling of being a little bit Western.

806
00:32:59,390 --> 00:33:01,590
It had kimchi and everything in it.

807
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:03,699
- This is you...
- Yes.

808
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,770
Because it's very subtle, very graceful.

809
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,910
(A graceful taste?)

810
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:15,080
It was subtle, artistic,

811
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:17,240
surprisingly delicious.

812
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:21,180
(He praises A Sung's Mild Tofu.)

813
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:24,380
I can tell from the food...

814
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,090
who the person is.

815
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,320
When you make food from your heart,

816
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,120
you show your personality.

817
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,290
(They feel rewarded for everything by the chef's genuine compliments.)

818
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,300
I love it all.

819
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,730
I can't pick a winner.

820
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:39,199
Very nice.

821
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,570
(Extremely touched)

822
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:42,040
Thank you so much.

823
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:44,269
It's very nice to be able...

824
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,770
to see their personality in their food.

825
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,610
(Coming up)

826
00:33:51,340 --> 00:33:52,380
Kyun.

827
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:58,420
(Suddenly, they burst out crying.)

828
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,890
(What happened to the Country members?)

829
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,859
- Well done, everyone.
- Well done.

830
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,706
(Now that the contest is over, let's eat together.)

831
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:11,930
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

832
00:34:12,470 --> 00:34:15,270
(They quench their thirst with refreshing beverage.)

833
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:18,570
(It removes all the tension.)

834
00:34:19,910 --> 00:34:20,910
It's so refreshing.

835
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,240
- I wanted to try this.
- Thank you for the food.

836
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:27,080
(Eating Mild Tofu)

837
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,819
It's too cold,

838
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,680
- but it's still good.
- It's so delicious.

839
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,020
The balance is perfect.

840
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:36,520
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

841
00:34:36,820 --> 00:34:39,389
(Next is Yo Han's kimchi pasta.)

842
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:41,090
Actually, I ruined it.

843
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:42,699
(That's not true, Yo Han.)

844
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,260
Then how is it so delicious?

845
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,330
- It's very good.
- Is there more pasta?

846
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,940
Today,

847
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:51,940
when I was cooking,

848
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,870
I had a hard time...

849
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,809
because of yam.

850
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,580
- The food for the ritual?
- Yes.

851
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,150
When I cut the yam,

852
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,450
I heard a voice.

853
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,279
The yam's voice.

854
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:06,790
(Did the yam talk?)

855
00:35:07,550 --> 00:35:09,490
Seriously, I heard it.

856
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:12,630
"Don't worry."

857
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,630
Did it talk?

858
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,060
I see. "Don't worry?"

859
00:35:18,870 --> 00:35:20,670
Kyun, you must be exhausted.

860
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,300
It's not funny?

861
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,869
It's such a dad joke.

862
00:35:25,870 --> 00:35:27,210
I found it funny.

863
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,279
Only Si A laughed.

864
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,610
It was funny.

865
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:32,579
I laugh easily.

866
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,780
(I'll laugh again next time.)

867
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:36,350
(Eddie's dad jokes will continue.)

868
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,779
That's right.

869
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,290
(Their night in Andong is coming to an end with Kentucky dad jokes.)

870
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:49,300
(The last day in Andong)

871
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,400
(What kind of day awaits Country members today?)

872
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,870
(Brushing)

873
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,340
(Cute and petite sisters brush their teeth together.)

874
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,439
(Hello, camera.)

875
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,680
Good morning.

876
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,550
(Do I look pretty?)

877
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,719
(Or not?)

878
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,336
(Making a short clip that makes our hearts flutter)

879
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:16,389
(Someone who made her debut 26 years ago)

880
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:17,566
(The variety show baby fascinated by the camera)

881
00:36:17,590 --> 00:36:18,590
(Gurgling)

882
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,790
(Isn't she cute?)

883
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:22,830
(A Sung's brushing teeth ASMR)

884
00:36:22,830 --> 00:36:23,830
(Gurgling)

885
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,130
- I'll join you soon.
- Okay.

886
00:36:33,210 --> 00:36:35,580
(Did you think that I was done?)

887
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,340
(Si A is in her best condition again today.)

888
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,349
(The atmosphere is quite different from the sisters.)

889
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,480
(Wriggling)

890
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,250
(What time is it?)

891
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,090
(Shall I get up now?)

892
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,930
(He has no intention to do so.)

893
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:56,030
(Someone will wake me up anyway.)

894
00:36:56,900 --> 00:37:00,100
(Yo Han went back to sleep.)

895
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:01,630
Chef!

896
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:04,799
- Chef!
- Hi, how are you?

897
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,869
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

898
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:08,539
Guess what I prepared.

899
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:09,540
What?

900
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:10,610
Ta-da.

901
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,679
- Here.
- What is... Oh, my gosh.

902
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,480
Oh, my gosh!

903
00:37:14,810 --> 00:37:15,980
What's this?

904
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,350
I grilled some Korean beef.

905
00:37:19,290 --> 00:37:22,390
(Getting groceries for Mini Culinary Class Wars yesterday)

906
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,830
(Korean beef is irresistible.)

907
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:31,330
I'll prepare assorted Korean beef in a cup.

908
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:33,099
(Grilling Andong Korean beef passionately in the morning)

909
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,060
I can't believe we're having beef in the morning.

910
00:37:35,570 --> 00:37:37,140
It looks nice and savory.

911
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,370
Is this traditional Korean breakfast?

912
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:42,510
Yes, it's my type of breakfast.

913
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,839
If you made this yesterday, you'd have placed first.

914
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,560
(I should've just grilled meat last night.)

915
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,550
- Isn't it delicious?
- Yes.

916
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:51,019
(Eddie eats Korean beef all in one go.)

917
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,190
It's good.

918
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,219
We're having a hearty breakfast.

919
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,796
(How about some Korean beef instead of coffee in the morning?)

920
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,560
Today, we leave for another place?

921
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:01,690
- We're going to Yeosu.
- Yeosu?

922
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,160
Before leaving,

923
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,629
we'll visit...

924
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:07,469
a beautiful place called Manhyujeong Pavilion.

925
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:09,170
- Okay.
- Then we'll make meju.

926
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,599
- Meju?
- Yes.

927
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,339
Have you seen meju before?

928
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:15,240
Yes, I've used it,

929
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,879
but I've never seen how it's made.

930
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,810
(Today's schedule will be inspiring for Eddie.)

931
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,380
That will be fun.

932
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,580
Okay.

933
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:25,019
Shall we head out to Manhyujeong Pavilion?

934
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:27,290
- Yes.
- Let's go.

935
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,490
Goodbye.

936
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,189
Bye, Andong.

937
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,990
- Bye, Andong.
- Goodbye.

938
00:38:34,590 --> 00:38:36,929
Manhyujeong Pavilion is one of the filming locations...

939
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:39,469
for the drama where Yo Han was in.

940
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:41,400
- "Mr. Sunshine?" - Yes.

941
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,239
(Their outing to Manhyujeong Pavilion...)

942
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,870
(as a special memory for Yo Han)

943
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,910
(Today's driver, A Sung)

944
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,780
Today, A Sung is driving.

945
00:38:51,410 --> 00:38:52,609
Our best driver.

946
00:38:52,610 --> 00:38:53,650
(You can count on me.)

947
00:38:54,350 --> 00:38:55,919
(On the other hand, )

948
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,380
(Eddie seems uncomfortable.)

949
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,619
(He's walking on eggshells...)

950
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:03,260
(around Yo Han.)

951
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,760
So we have to talk about "Mr. Sunshine?"

952
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,159
- Yes, we have to.
- Yes, a little bit.

953
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,640
(Why is Eddie feeling uncomfortable?)

954
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,630
(During their video call before the trip)

955
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:15,070
My movie or TV drama.

956
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,000
(I watched "Mr. Sunshine" where Yo Han was cast.)

957
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:21,240
(Eddie brought up "Mr. Sunshine" during their first meeting.)

958
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:24,209
(It was an interesting drama.)

959
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:25,280
(Thank you, Kyun.)

960
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,080
(Around the topic of "Mr. Sunshine," the two men got close quickly.)

961
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:31,750
(I'm aware of how much you like me as my fan.)

962
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:34,830
I didn't watch all the episodes.

963
00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:36,219
You didn't?

964
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,490
You didn't watch it, Edward?

965
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,260
I watched a little.

966
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:41,590
I mean...

967
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:44,700
You keep changing your opinion on whether you saw it or not.

968
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,029
(I'm sorry, Yo Han.)

969
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,230
He watched a little.

970
00:39:48,430 --> 00:39:50,590
I watched the entire series from the start to the end.

971
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:52,210
I watched it twice.

972
00:39:52,710 --> 00:39:54,409
He was born in Korea,

973
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,239
but he grew up in the US.

974
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,379
Then he returned to Korea.

975
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:59,280
That's a character called Eugene Choi.

976
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,380
You know, it's kind of my life. In a way.

977
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:03,749
Really?

978
00:40:03,750 --> 00:40:05,650
(Their reaction is icy cold.)

979
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:07,850
You just said that you didn't watch it.

980
00:40:08,050 --> 00:40:09,990
Right, you didn't even watch it.

981
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,960
Goodness.

982
00:40:12,290 --> 00:40:13,689
You know why?

983
00:40:13,690 --> 00:40:16,730
Korean dramas are so sad. I'm serious.

984
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,499
I fast-forward everything...

985
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:19,770
just to watch your scene.

986
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:22,300
(Thank you, Kyun.)

987
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:27,040
I love your character in "Mr. Sunshine."

988
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,909
I thought highly of him.

989
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:30,109
(The acting compliments make Byun Yo Han shy.)

990
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:31,579
(A carefree modern boy)

991
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:33,380
(Yo Han played Kim Hee Sung with enthusiasm.)

992
00:40:34,680 --> 00:40:37,819
(His eyes change as soon as he starts acting.)

993
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,550
(The moment of him being in his element)

994
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,589
(That's right. I'm quite the actor.)

995
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,060
Is this where "Mr. Sunshine" was shot?

996
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:48,829
- Yes.
- "Mr. Sunshine."

997
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,230
Are you familiar with the place?

998
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,300
I've never been here.

999
00:40:53,770 --> 00:40:54,869
He never had a shoot here.

1000
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,740
It's my first time here, Kyun. I'm the same as you.

1001
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,239
(The supporting main lead is emotional.)

1002
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,869
I love the scene...

1003
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:04,179
when Lee Byung Hun and Kim Tae Ri decide...

1004
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,710
to fall in love with each other.

1005
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:07,979
- Manhyujeong Pavilion is there.
- We're here.

1006
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,280
Thank you for driving.

1007
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,089
(Built by Kim Gye Haeng, a Joseon Dynasty scholar-official, )

1008
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,849
(to read and meditate in his later years, )

1009
00:41:14,850 --> 00:41:16,089
(it was designated as...)

1010
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:18,530
(a North Gyeongsang Province cultural heritage site in 1986.)

1011
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:20,329
("Let's love.")

1012
00:41:20,330 --> 00:41:21,966
(It was where the memorable scene was born.)

1013
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,659
We just have to go up 200m.

1014
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,700
(Amazed)

1015
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:28,169
- How cool.
- You're there.

1016
00:41:28,170 --> 00:41:29,669
- It has a photo of you.
- It's so cool.

1017
00:41:29,670 --> 00:41:30,700
Where?

1018
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,239
My gosh.

1019
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,940
(I'm a famous man.)

1020
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:36,080
Why do you not grow out your beard?

1021
00:41:36,580 --> 00:41:38,679
- You look cool.
- So as not to overlap with you.

1022
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,849
I had grown it out.

1023
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:41,150
(I grew it out, then shaved it.)

1024
00:41:43,450 --> 00:41:44,480
Gosh.

1025
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,989
I'm really bad at hiking.

1026
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:47,990
Really?

1027
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:49,619
(It's tiresome.)

1028
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:51,120
The line is written over there.

1029
00:41:51,490 --> 00:41:53,589
- I'll step back.
- "You should move on."

1030
00:41:53,590 --> 00:41:55,629
- "I will take a step back." - "You should move on."

1031
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,629
- Move on.
- We will step back.

1032
00:41:57,630 --> 00:41:59,069
- Move on.
- Go ahead.

1033
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:00,070
(Joking)

1034
00:42:00,071 --> 00:42:01,730
We'll move on.

1035
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:03,539
I'm out of breath.

1036
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,300
(Everyone will move on.)

1037
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,409
(On the way to the Manhyujeong Pavilion)

1038
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:09,440
- Isn't it beautiful?
- Yes.

1039
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,679
(A picturesque scenery made by the frozen valley stream)

1040
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,649
How about we go ice skating there?

1041
00:42:13,650 --> 00:42:14,650
No.

1042
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,849
Are we in Iceland?

1043
00:42:17,850 --> 00:42:20,319
(The frozen Songam Fall, enjoyable in Manhyujeong Pavilion's winters)

1044
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,220
How do you say frozen waterfall in Korean?

1045
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,360
- Eoleum pokpo.
- "Eoleum pokpo."

1046
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,930
It's here too, Yo Han.

1047
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,300
I know.

1048
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,059
They were in love at a high place.

1049
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,870
(Let's do it. Let's love.)

1050
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,230
(Yo Han.)

1051
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,569
(Kyun.)

1052
00:42:37,570 --> 00:42:39,169
(The camera is on standby.)

1053
00:42:39,170 --> 00:42:40,809
I'm not doing it with Kyun.

1054
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,839
(No, stop.)

1055
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:44,539
Why did you suddenly look at me with sincere eyes?

1056
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,850
You two should shoot a video.

1057
00:42:47,950 --> 00:42:49,119
You get shy, don't you?

1058
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,279
I can't stand it.

1059
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,480
(He can't stand cheesiness.)

1060
00:42:52,450 --> 00:42:53,649
(The two have become distant.)

1061
00:42:53,650 --> 00:42:55,189
(As they walk, putting the awkwardness behind them)

1062
00:42:55,190 --> 00:42:56,260
That's pretty.

1063
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,859
(The beautiful scenery has finally shown itself.)

1064
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,159
That's so cool.

1065
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,399
(Like a part of the mountainside, )

1066
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
(Manhyujeong Pavilion has blended with nature.)

1067
00:43:07,430 --> 00:43:08,469
It's pretty.

1068
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:10,176
(Unlike the members enjoying Manhyujeong Pavilion's charms)

1069
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:12,610
- Let's go.
- This place is gorgeous.

1070
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:16,010
(Kim Hee Sung wants to leave quickly.)

1071
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,840
Edward. Can you stop right there?

1072
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,209
I'll take a photo.

1073
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:22,570
(This bridge that can't be missed)

1074
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,019
(Yo Han. Do you remember this bridge?)

1075
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,189
(Here it comes.)

1076
00:43:26,190 --> 00:43:28,049
(Yo Han is getting caught up.)

1077
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,120
I've never been to this place, okay?

1078
00:43:30,890 --> 00:43:31,989
Let's do it.

1079
00:43:31,990 --> 00:43:33,130
(He wants to act.)

1080
00:43:35,430 --> 00:43:37,259
(Even Eddie, who only watched the drama a bit, )

1081
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:39,070
(remembers the memorable scene.)

1082
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:43,870
(With the beautiful Manhyujeong Pavilion as the background, )

1083
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,310
(it's not a love story of a man and a woman.)

1084
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:51,680
(It's a love story of a man and a man.)

1085
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,080
Let's love.

1086
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:58,150
(Bear with it.)

1087
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,889
Overwhelmingly.

1088
00:43:59,890 --> 00:44:01,350
(Enjoying it up close)

1089
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,490
Like the frozen waterfall,

1090
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:08,430
my love won't change.

1091
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,530
I'm ready.

1092
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,776
(To think it's already over when we want more.)

1093
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:17,140
He's a lot cooler.

1094
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,370
He's a lot cooler than Eugene Choi.

1095
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,839
That was great.

1096
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:23,010
- It was.
- Right?

1097
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:25,809
(Even I think...)

1098
00:44:25,810 --> 00:44:27,850
(I killed it.)

1099
00:44:28,450 --> 00:44:30,219
We had the best walk.

1100
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,260
(The members' Manhyujeong Pavilion date has ended.)

1101
00:44:32,690 --> 00:44:34,290
Let's go to see meju.

1102
00:44:35,150 --> 00:44:36,220
I'm in.

1103
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:44,929
(A 30 minute drive)

1104
00:44:44,930 --> 00:44:46,930
(They're close to Meju Village.)

1105
00:44:47,830 --> 00:44:50,199
We'll be eating in the Meju village, right?

1106
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:51,640
(Foodie Si A is hungry.)

1107
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,410
Mount Hakga is known for its good kimchi.

1108
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,239
It sounds delicious.

1109
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,740
(How did you know that?)

1110
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,449
Meju is waiting for us.

1111
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:01,930
(Meju, the Country members are here.)

1112
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:03,879
(A scene full of old rural taste)

1113
00:45:03,880 --> 00:45:05,619
(The Country members are here!)

1114
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:07,519
(Welcome.)

1115
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:08,520
Okay.

1116
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:09,959
Thank you for driving for 4 hours and 30 minutes.

1117
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,260
Thank you, A Sung.

1118
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:13,330
Gosh.

1119
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:16,030
(They arrive at today's destination.)

1120
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:18,499
We're here.

1121
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,470
(Let's have a taste of the air first.)

1122
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:27,670
(The place full of the earthy scent...)

1123
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,309
(is Mount Hakga Meju Village...)

1124
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:31,940
(in Yecheon, North Gyeongsang Province.)

1125
00:45:33,110 --> 00:45:35,249
(Invaluable ingredients from nature...)

1126
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:37,320
(along with dedicated hands)

1127
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:42,520
(The village making meju the traditional way)

1128
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,690
(There's a famous trio in this village.)

1129
00:45:48,260 --> 00:45:49,759
I'm a veteran in this village...

1130
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:52,800
with 50 years of experience in making meju.

1131
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,340
I've been making meju in this village for 40 years.

1132
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,699
I'm the second leader of this village.

1133
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:00,769
(Ban Jeom Boon, 77 years old, Meju Village's second)

1134
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,510
I'm this village's...

1135
00:46:03,110 --> 00:46:04,739
- What was it again?
- This village's...

1136
00:46:04,740 --> 00:46:06,349
- I'm this village's...
- third...

1137
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:07,850
third leader.

1138
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:11,780
I've been making meju for about 30 years together.

1139
00:46:12,050 --> 00:46:13,420
She's the third and grunt.

1140
00:46:13,750 --> 00:46:15,790
Give her a higher position.

1141
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,130
(Fall in love with the charms of meju with the trio.)

1142
00:46:21,590 --> 00:46:23,529
- Hi.
- Hi.

1143
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,169
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

1144
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:28,199
- Hi.
- Hi.

1145
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:29,569
- Welcome.
- Hi.

1146
00:46:29,570 --> 00:46:31,440
I've seen this old guy a lot.

1147
00:46:31,770 --> 00:46:33,709
We often see you on TV.

1148
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:35,439
- We do.
- I see. Thank you.

1149
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,880
Hi.

1150
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,309
- Did you come from the US?
- Yes.

1151
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:43,320
I can easily tell by how you talk.

1152
00:46:43,450 --> 00:46:45,350
(What a cute elderly.)

1153
00:46:45,650 --> 00:46:47,489
- You're like my son.
- Oh, right.

1154
00:46:47,490 --> 00:46:48,890
My youngest son.

1155
00:46:49,620 --> 00:46:51,890
I'm grateful you came all the way here.

1156
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:55,560
- Gosh.
- Ma'am.

1157
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,060
- It smells good.
- It does?

1158
00:46:59,230 --> 00:47:01,370
Are you here to watch us make meju?

1159
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,639
- Yes.
- Yes.

1160
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,640
(We're curious.)

1161
00:47:03,641 --> 00:47:06,040
- Open it.
- It's not done steaming.

1162
00:47:06,870 --> 00:47:08,410
It's not thoroughly cooked yet.

1163
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:10,240
It needs to boil for six hours.

1164
00:47:10,380 --> 00:47:12,210
That's a mountain of beans.

1165
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:14,310
Gosh.

1166
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,280
- Try it.
- Okay.

1167
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:20,970
- Try it. It's good.
- It's good.

1168
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:23,489
- Try one each.
- Thank you.

1169
00:47:23,490 --> 00:47:25,719
It's delicious as we make it ourselves.

1170
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,890
I'm okay.

1171
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:30,399
- It's very flavorful.
- It's earthy.

1172
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,729
It has to steam more. Only then will it become good meju.

1173
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:35,230
Do you have to boil the beans first...

1174
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:36,969
to make meju?

1175
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:38,339
What's after boiling the beans?

1176
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:40,209
Due to the large quantity of beans,

1177
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:43,140
we have to scoop the bottom ones to the top.

1178
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:45,809
(The key to boiling meju beans)

1179
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:47,309
(Repeatedly turn them over...)

1180
00:47:47,310 --> 00:47:48,449
(to prevent the bottom beans...)

1181
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:49,650
(from becoming mushy)

1182
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:52,279
(The process of making meju: Boil the beans.)

1183
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:53,489
After steaming them more,

1184
00:47:53,490 --> 00:47:55,090
the beans will be crushed.

1185
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:57,620
Then, the crushed beans are packed into shape.

1186
00:47:58,060 --> 00:48:00,760
(Crush the beans, shape them, and wrap with straws.)

1187
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:05,800
(Meju is made with time and devotion.)

1188
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,030
- Over there.
- So those are meju.

1189
00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:09,670
I saw them when I was young.

1190
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:12,710
My grandma used to make it at home.

1191
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:15,939
Did you make all of the pastes yourself?

1192
00:48:15,940 --> 00:48:17,110
We made them.

1193
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,849
There are numerous pastes and soy sauces.

1194
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:21,680
(The yard is filled with various pastes.)

1195
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,649
Both paste and soy sauce are good.

1196
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:24,650
I see.

1197
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:27,750
You can chew the beans. It's earthy and delicious.

1198
00:48:28,390 --> 00:48:30,060
Have them taste the paste.

1199
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:32,689
Try a bit of Korea's paste.

1200
00:48:32,690 --> 00:48:33,730
Okay.

1201
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:35,590
- Is it doenjang?
- Yes.

1202
00:48:35,890 --> 00:48:37,400
It's good, but only taste a little.

1203
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:39,370
Isn't it good?

1204
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:43,439
- It's good, right?
- It tastes different.

1205
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,169
How old is this one?

1206
00:48:45,170 --> 00:48:46,540
About three years.

1207
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:48,239
- Three years.
- Three years?

1208
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:49,756
(The doenjang has fermented for 3 years.)

1209
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,410
The other...

1210
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:53,049
- doenjang.
- Gangwon Province?

1211
00:48:53,050 --> 00:48:54,349
It tastes completely different...

1212
00:48:54,350 --> 00:48:56,349
- It's good, right?
- from Gangwon's doenjang.

1213
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:58,219
Did you dine in Gangwon Province?

1214
00:48:58,220 --> 00:48:59,319
Yes. We went to Jeongseon in Gangwon Province.

1215
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,390
Really? Jeongseon?

1216
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,190
(Tasted previously in Gangwon Province)

1217
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:04,219
(The 4-year-old doenjang...)

1218
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:05,660
(was salty yet flavorful.)

1219
00:49:06,690 --> 00:49:10,700
(Eddie had found the best doenjang in his life.)

1220
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,770
It tastes like the countryside.

1221
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,340
It's earthy.

1222
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:18,099
- It's salty yet earthy.
- It tastes homey.

1223
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,439
It's amazing.

1224
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:21,770
This is all I need over some rice as a meal.

1225
00:49:23,340 --> 00:49:25,439
It's very difficult for me to explain.

1226
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,180
But the doenjang is so different.

1227
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:30,150
I kept saying this had a countryside taste.

1228
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:31,620
It's a little wild.

1229
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,990
It feels more naturally fermented.

1230
00:49:34,290 --> 00:49:35,750
It's definitely saltier.

1231
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:38,190
It has a really interesting flavor.

1232
00:49:38,790 --> 00:49:39,859
Is it good?

1233
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,929
- It's delicious.
- It's really good.

1234
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:41,989
- Right?
- It's totally different.

1235
00:49:41,990 --> 00:49:44,199
- The doenjang.
- I want some rice.

1236
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,559
Rice? Over there.

1237
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:47,530
- We're already cooking rice.
- Wait just a bit.

1238
00:49:47,930 --> 00:49:49,769
- That's rice.
- Wait for a bit.

1239
00:49:49,770 --> 00:49:50,799
Cast iron pot rice?

1240
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,499
Yes. We're making rice in the cast iron pot.

1241
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,970
We're also boiling suyuk.

1242
00:49:55,410 --> 00:49:57,580
- Suyuk?
- We're boiling beans too.

1243
00:49:57,880 --> 00:49:59,679
- And we're making rice.
- I see.

1244
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:00,680
All of them are full.

1245
00:50:00,681 --> 00:50:02,049
They sound delicious.

1246
00:50:02,050 --> 00:50:04,119
Try the meat once it's cooked.

1247
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,120
Okay.

1248
00:50:05,121 --> 00:50:07,049
- I bet the meat will taste amazing.
- It has to cook.

1249
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,789
- Shall we go?
- Yes.

1250
00:50:08,790 --> 00:50:09,860
- Let's go.
- Okay.

1251
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:12,789
I'm so happy to meet you.

1252
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:13,960
- Are you?
- Yes.

1253
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:17,329
(The meju leader's house)

1254
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,699
Your place is really pretty.

1255
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,099
(The meju leader is busy making lunch.)

1256
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:24,400
(Washing the vegetables relentlessly)

1257
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:28,340
(Prepping the ingredients meticulously)

1258
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:30,939
(At that moment, the door opens.)

1259
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:32,950
(Eddie comes inside.)

1260
00:50:33,050 --> 00:50:34,910
(May I have a look?)

1261
00:50:35,110 --> 00:50:37,950
(What is the lunch menu the leader is preparing?)

1262
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:41,549
(The main ingredients: Meju Village's doenjang...)

1263
00:50:41,550 --> 00:50:43,959
(and aromatic wild chives)

1264
00:50:43,960 --> 00:50:45,319
Do you need any help?

1265
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:46,429
(Yo Han and A Sung have joined them.)

1266
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:47,530
No, I don't.

1267
00:50:47,730 --> 00:50:50,100
(This is my area!)

1268
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:52,160
(Chopping the zucchini roughly)

1269
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,600
Zucchini.

1270
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:58,640
(Chopping the pepper into big pieces)

1271
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,010
(Putting the ingredients in before the water boils)

1272
00:51:02,110 --> 00:51:03,340
(She's focused on cooking.)

1273
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:05,210
(They're focused on her.)

1274
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:09,480
(Experience leaves no room for hesitation.)

1275
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,720
(Adding the tofu in indifferently)

1276
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:14,690
(She's fast.)

1277
00:51:15,720 --> 00:51:17,019
The smell of mushroom.

1278
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:18,340
(The pot is full of ingredients.)

1279
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,489
(The last ingredient is...)

1280
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:21,729
It needs some MSG.

1281
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,099
- MSG?
- My favorite.

1282
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,360
(MSG)

1283
00:51:25,460 --> 00:51:26,469
(A little bit...)

1284
00:51:26,470 --> 00:51:29,870
(more and more)

1285
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:31,300
Oh, gosh.

1286
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:32,300
(I love the savoriness.)

1287
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:34,410
(The most important ingredient remains.)

1288
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,640
Will she add doenjang in here?

1289
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:41,310
It reminds me of my hometown and grandma.

1290
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,950
Do you see all of these ingredients?

1291
00:51:46,490 --> 00:51:47,890
It looks good.

1292
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:52,490
(The wild chive doenjang stew is complete.)

1293
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,360
(A Classic Countryside Dish: Wild Chive Doenjang Stew)

1294
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:58,399
(Yo Han is setting up the table.)

1295
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,400
It's hot.

1296
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:02,020
(A mountain of rice equivalent of the elderly's love)

1297
00:52:02,870 --> 00:52:04,370
It's thoroughly cooked.

1298
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,840
(Preparing suyuk for the Country members)

1299
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,779
(Cast Iron Pot Suyuk with the Warmth of the Countryside)

1300
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,950
Okay, let's eat.

1301
00:52:16,420 --> 00:52:18,779
Ma'am, let's eat.

1302
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:20,019
Let's eat together.

1303
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,449
Let's go eat.

1304
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:23,289
- You're a celebrity, right?
- Yes.

1305
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,959
- Was it Ko A Sung?
- Correct.

1306
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,859
I watched "Young Lady and Gentleman."

1307
00:52:27,860 --> 00:52:29,490
Thank you.

1308
00:52:31,030 --> 00:52:32,300
But I wasn't in that drama.

1309
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:33,829
I saw you in that drama.

1310
00:52:33,830 --> 00:52:35,130
In "Young Lady and Gentleman?"

1311
00:52:35,230 --> 00:52:38,100
Yes, in "Young Lady and Gentleman."

1312
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:42,170
I'll choose a work titled "Young Lady and Gentleman."

1313
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:46,140
(Enjoy the food.)

1314
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:48,979
Let's eat together, ma'am.

1315
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,749
- Let's eat.
- Let's eat.

1316
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:52,249
Take that seat over there.

1317
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:54,389
- Sit on the other side.
- Here's your stew.

1318
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:55,949
- Thank you.
- Look at the mountain of rice.

1319
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:57,819
Great. Try the mountain of rice.

1320
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,959
- You should have more.
- Me?

1321
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:02,259
- Have more.
- Thank you.

1322
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,499
I have too much.

1323
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,299
You should have more for traveling far.

1324
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,300
(Giving love)

1325
00:53:06,301 --> 00:53:08,029
You didn't have breakfast, right?

1326
00:53:08,030 --> 00:53:09,900
- Thank you.
- Here.

1327
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:12,340
- Try it.
- Okay. Thank you.

1328
00:53:12,570 --> 00:53:14,409
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1329
00:53:14,410 --> 00:53:15,709
- The paste is good.
- Everything is good.

1330
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,209
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

1331
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,379
It could be bland.

1332
00:53:18,380 --> 00:53:19,380
Is it okay?

1333
00:53:19,381 --> 00:53:22,449
- Wrap the pork with kimchi.
- Okay.

1334
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:24,050
(I'll give you a demonstration.)

1335
00:53:25,620 --> 00:53:26,719
Have a wrap of it.

1336
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:28,119
(Foodie Si A copies her right away.)

1337
00:53:28,120 --> 00:53:29,219
It's delicious.

1338
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,420
- Wrap the meat with kimchi?
- Yes.

1339
00:53:31,620 --> 00:53:32,689
It's so good.

1340
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:34,030
(A delicious combo)

1341
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:37,560
It's really good.

1342
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,000
Unbelievable.

1343
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:42,829
It's much better than what I get at a restaurant.

1344
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:43,999
- It's good, right?
- Yes.

1345
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,640
(She's happy they're digging in.)

1346
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:48,440
The doenjang stew was made just now.

1347
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:50,380
But because the doenjang is so good,

1348
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:52,979
- The doenjang is good.
- the stew is still tasty.

1349
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:53,980
Goodness.

1350
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:57,719
It's nice cooking with the ingredients we grow.

1351
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,180
(Let's eat more instead of talking.)

1352
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,520
It's really nice.

1353
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:04,119
This is something you can't taste in the city.

1354
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:05,889
- You're right.
- You can't taste it in Seoul.

1355
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:07,029
Exactly.

1356
00:54:07,030 --> 00:54:08,030
But well...

1357
00:54:08,031 --> 00:54:09,060
Isn't it delicious?

1358
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:10,929
The taste differs.

1359
00:54:10,930 --> 00:54:12,250
(The elderly's love can be felt.)

1360
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,200
(Strangely, Eddie is quiet.)

1361
00:54:14,201 --> 00:54:16,600
- Put it here.
- No, don't.

1362
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:19,240
I made the tofu at home.

1363
00:54:19,970 --> 00:54:21,410
You made the tofu?

1364
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,179
(He's quietly eating.)

1365
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,140
- I made it at home.
- It's delicious.

1366
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:27,280
Dig in, old guy.

1367
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:29,150
(Laughing)

1368
00:54:29,151 --> 00:54:30,719
Dig in, old guy.

1369
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,919
(Nodding)

1370
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,919
Come on. Don't call him "old guy."

1371
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,019
She's joking around because of your beard.

1372
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:38,090
She's joking around because of your beard.

1373
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:39,829
It's a joke. I'm not serious.

1374
00:54:39,830 --> 00:54:41,430
Right? That's why you're an old guy.

1375
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:44,360
(Eddie doesn't respond to the joke.)

1376
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:46,430
(What's wrong, Eddie?)

1377
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:48,270
(Is the food not good?)

1378
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:50,400
Are you upset?

1379
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:52,870
No, it's just...

1380
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,440
Give me a minute.

1381
00:54:56,441 --> 00:54:58,140
(Eddie is struggling to find the words.)

1382
00:55:03,720 --> 00:55:04,819
Why are you crying?

1383
00:55:04,820 --> 00:55:06,179
(Eddie crying shocks everyone.)

1384
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:07,220
Kyun?

1385
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,190
Did I make a bad joke?

1386
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:15,760
My grandma...

1387
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:17,930
- My grandma...
- What?

1388
00:55:20,270 --> 00:55:23,370
My grandma used to make suyuk for me.

1389
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:25,920
Remembering his grandma is making him cry.

1390
00:55:27,710 --> 00:55:28,770
Tasting it...

1391
00:55:29,310 --> 00:55:31,410
reminded me of my grandma.

1392
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,320
It reminded him of his grandma.

1393
00:55:33,650 --> 00:55:37,120
(The countryside table reminds him of his grandmother's love.)

1394
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,579
You're reminded of your grandma?

1395
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:41,550
His grandmother raised him.

1396
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:42,850
Did she pass away?

1397
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:45,220
His grandma raised him.

1398
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,859
My wish is to eat...

1399
00:55:47,860 --> 00:55:51,400
my grandma's cooking even if it's just once.

1400
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:56,370
When I was young, my grandma...

1401
00:55:56,470 --> 00:56:00,310
always made me seaweed soup, jangjorim, and such.

1402
00:56:00,370 --> 00:56:02,940
I had them every day...

1403
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,910
as a kid. My inspiration comes...

1404
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:07,880
from those dishes.

1405
00:56:08,310 --> 00:56:11,119
An elderly's hand contains many sauces.

1406
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,120
Totally.

1407
00:56:12,420 --> 00:56:17,219
I've always thought it'd be nice to have her recipe.

1408
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:18,220
We should find it.

1409
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:20,290
The recipe.

1410
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:26,130
(The trip was to find his grandmother's handmade cooking.)

1411
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,629
(And finally, Eddie found it today.)

1412
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:32,470
Did you miss your grandma's Korean cooking that much?

1413
00:56:32,670 --> 00:56:34,310
Eating this reminded me...

1414
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:36,310
of my grandma.

1415
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:37,980
It's really good.

1416
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,649
It reminded me a lot of my grandmother's food...

1417
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:42,680
that she cooked.

1418
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:44,620
So I love to eat this dish.

1419
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:48,390
Everything was really cheap and simple.

1420
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:51,120
It was cooked really fast,

1421
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:53,459
but it was done with love.

1422
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,930
And I could taste that in their food.

1423
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:58,729
We didn't have a lot of money,

1424
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:03,030
so she didn't buy fancy things. We never ate fancy things.

1425
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:05,139
Because when I was young,

1426
00:57:05,140 --> 00:57:06,169
I ate it all the time.

1427
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:08,040
But I probably didn't appreciate it enough.

1428
00:57:09,070 --> 00:57:11,310
It'd be awesome to be able to go back,

1429
00:57:11,410 --> 00:57:13,650
even just to say thank you.

1430
00:57:15,450 --> 00:57:20,520
(Eddie shed tears for unspoken gratitude and longing.)

1431
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:24,989
Hurry up and dig in.

1432
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:26,320
- Okay.
- Eat up.

1433
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,060
You truly love your grandma.

1434
00:57:34,330 --> 00:57:36,299
My grandma made it the same way.

1435
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,300
She did?

1436
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:42,240
(Si A is crying too.)

1437
00:57:44,940 --> 00:57:46,209
Enough already.

1438
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:47,210
(Stop crying.)

1439
00:57:47,211 --> 00:57:50,449
But you're crying too, ma'am.

1440
00:57:50,450 --> 00:57:51,619
Give me a tissue.

1441
00:57:51,620 --> 00:57:54,190
Because you're crying, I'm crying more.

1442
00:57:55,550 --> 00:57:56,589
I'm sorry.

1443
00:57:56,590 --> 00:57:59,390
(The story about Eddie's grandmother made lunch tearful.)

1444
00:58:00,530 --> 00:58:02,790
Don't cry.

1445
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:05,399
She's the type to cry easily.

1446
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:07,599
Me too. I'm a total crybaby.

1447
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:09,129
- I'm a crybaby too.
- I see.

1448
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:10,499
I cry on the inside.

1449
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:11,500
- On the inside?
- Yes.

1450
00:58:11,501 --> 00:58:12,861
A man shouldn't cry on the inside.

1451
00:58:13,470 --> 00:58:14,769
- Really?
- Crying...

1452
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,340
Crying will help you blow off steam.

1453
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,480
Bottling it up inside will only make you sick.

1454
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:20,949
That must be why I'm sick.

1455
00:58:20,950 --> 00:58:22,110
(Joking around)

1456
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,220
You should relieve it.

1457
00:58:24,221 --> 00:58:26,026
(Thanks to the elderly, Eddie is smiling again.)

1458
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:27,890
The kimchi is good. Make sure to dig in.

1459
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:29,420
(Burping)

1460
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:33,629
- Thank you, ma'am.
- That was amazing.

1461
00:58:33,630 --> 00:58:36,090
- May you be blessed.
- It was great.

1462
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:37,730
- That was...
- I feel good myself.

1463
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,160
I feel all better now.

1464
00:58:39,360 --> 00:58:40,499
(You shouldn't cry, then laugh.)

1465
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,369
A burp makes you feel better.

1466
00:58:42,370 --> 00:58:44,369
- Exactly.
- It hits the spot.

1467
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,940
Yes, it hits the spot.

1468
00:58:46,570 --> 00:58:48,010
Thank you.

1469
00:58:49,470 --> 00:58:52,040
You all grew up together, right?

1470
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,809
I moved to this village after I got married.

1471
00:58:55,810 --> 00:58:57,380
I married and moved at 20.

1472
00:58:57,880 --> 00:59:02,120
Since then, I've been living in this village for 45 years.

1473
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:03,590
For 45 years?

1474
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,959
- I got married at 16.
- What?

1475
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,359
- At 16?
- Me too.

1476
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,300
I've been in this village for over 70 years.

1477
00:59:12,130 --> 00:59:13,250
That was normal in the past.

1478
00:59:13,300 --> 00:59:15,469
But that was super young.

1479
00:59:15,470 --> 00:59:17,199
- Isn't sixteen...
- Sixteen is so young.

1480
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,600
In the third year of middle school?

1481
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:20,939
Everyone married early in the past.

1482
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,709
Back then, nobody sent us to school...

1483
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:23,710
and such.

1484
00:59:23,711 --> 00:59:25,440
(It used to be like that back then.)

1485
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:27,109
(Leader Lee Sung Sik, Youngest Shin Sook Yi)

1486
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,650
(It's been 45 years since they met and lived in Meju Village.)

1487
00:59:29,750 --> 00:59:32,319
(Youngest Shin Sook Yi)

1488
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:33,320
(Leader Lee Sung Sik, Youngest Shin Sook Yi)

1489
00:59:33,321 --> 00:59:35,650
(They were together in times of toughness and happiness.)

1490
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:38,990
(Youngest Shin Sook Yi, Leader Lee Sung Sik)

1491
00:59:39,560 --> 00:59:42,460
(Like meju fermenting with care, )

1492
00:59:42,730 --> 00:59:46,500
(time grew and deepened the trio's friendship.)

1493
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,970
Get a spoonful of rice and top it with pepper dipped in paste.

1494
00:59:51,400 --> 00:59:52,400
Okay.

1495
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:55,509
- This is how you eat pepper.
- Isn't it spicy pepper?

1496
00:59:55,510 --> 00:59:57,310
- Try it.
- Dip it in the paste.

1497
00:59:57,880 --> 00:59:58,880
Here.

1498
00:59:58,881 --> 01:00:00,649
- It's not spicy.
- Take small bites of it.

1499
01:00:00,650 --> 01:00:02,010
(Trust me and take a bite.)

1500
01:00:02,510 --> 01:00:05,780
(A Sung musters up her courage and tries it.)

1501
01:00:06,020 --> 01:00:07,919
(It's not spicy, is it?)

1502
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,820
(Is it spicy?)

1503
01:00:10,590 --> 01:00:12,419
It's Cheongyang pepper and spicy. Are you crying?

1504
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:13,559
(You're a liar, ma'am!)

1505
01:00:13,560 --> 01:00:14,560
It's spicy.

1506
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,560
Is it spicy?

1507
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:17,060
(Laughing)

1508
01:00:17,061 --> 01:00:18,430
I told you she'd cry.

1509
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:20,300
She's in trouble.

1510
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:22,029
She's going to cry.

1511
01:00:22,030 --> 01:00:23,230
It's too spicy.

1512
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,000
Milk.

1513
01:00:25,001 --> 01:00:27,310
(She goes straight to the fridge to cool down.)

1514
01:00:30,010 --> 01:00:32,840
(The one who can't handle the spicy food cries.)

1515
01:00:33,650 --> 01:00:34,650
(Screaming)

1516
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:35,950
Is she okay?

1517
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:39,149
She's suffering because you fed her a spicy one.

1518
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,320
(Laughing)

1519
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:43,290
You gave me a spicy one.

1520
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:46,219
I escaped a near death.

1521
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,129
I wanted you to have a tasty one. Sorry.

1522
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:49,130
(Sorry.)

1523
01:00:49,990 --> 01:00:52,199
- Was it spicy?
- It was so spicy.

1524
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:54,076
(Tears and laughter fill the table of the countryside.)

1525
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,100
It was so good, though.

1526
01:00:55,300 --> 01:00:57,339
- It was really good.
- We really enjoyed it.

1527
01:00:57,340 --> 01:00:58,839
It was delicious.

1528
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,840
(A homecooked meal is the best.)

1529
01:00:59,841 --> 01:01:01,740
(Good.)

1530
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,280
You have to go and work now.

1531
01:01:04,380 --> 01:01:05,380
Okay.

1532
01:01:05,381 --> 01:01:07,461
(Now that they've eaten well, shall they get going?)

1533
01:01:10,150 --> 01:01:12,480
You look great.

1534
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:17,190
(The perfect weather to work)

1535
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:18,460
Where are we going?

1536
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,559
- To work.
- To work.

1537
01:01:20,560 --> 01:01:21,890
- You should work now.
- Yes.

1538
01:01:22,530 --> 01:01:24,660
You all ate, so you should pay for it with labor.

1539
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,200
I'll pay it with my labor three times as much.

1540
01:01:29,430 --> 01:01:30,500
Gosh. Look at all that.

1541
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:32,240
It's meju.

1542
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:33,240
(But they didn't know...)

1543
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,040
(the enormous load of work was waiting for them.)

1544
01:01:40,580 --> 01:01:44,080
(Will the Country members survive it?)

1545
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,290
(They've arrived at the meju workshop.)

1546
01:01:49,990 --> 01:01:51,360
Go in slowly.

1547
01:01:54,230 --> 01:01:57,460
Gosh. It smells so flavorful.

1548
01:01:58,430 --> 01:01:59,899
(The soybeans that pile up like a mountain...)

1549
01:01:59,900 --> 01:02:01,130
There are so many soybeans.

1550
01:02:02,270 --> 01:02:06,940
(and the old tools)

1551
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,639
Now that we've eaten, let's pay it back with our labor.

1552
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:12,640
Now...

1553
01:02:12,740 --> 01:02:13,879
Are these soybeans?

1554
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,109
Yes. We'll put them together and grind them.

1555
01:02:16,110 --> 01:02:17,349
- Okay. Give it to me.
- Here.

1556
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:18,650
- Hold tightly.
- Yes.

1557
01:02:18,750 --> 01:02:21,420
What is it? Put it here.

1558
01:02:23,350 --> 01:02:26,619
I'll give you some, so grind them.

1559
01:02:26,620 --> 01:02:27,660
- Okay.
- Crush them.

1560
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:29,490
What are you doing?

1561
01:02:30,090 --> 01:02:31,359
(Yelling harshly at them)

1562
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:32,360
Pardon?

1563
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,070
You have to crush them hard like this.

1564
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:37,199
This is the only way.

1565
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:39,640
You can't crush them like that.

1566
01:02:40,470 --> 01:02:42,069
- Crush them like this.
- As for that...

1567
01:02:42,070 --> 01:02:43,586
(She is very strict when it comes to meju.)

1568
01:02:43,610 --> 01:02:46,280
(Crushing with power as soon as they took a seat)

1569
01:02:46,850 --> 01:02:48,549
After crushing them...

1570
01:02:48,550 --> 01:02:50,580
We have to weigh them.

1571
01:02:50,980 --> 01:02:52,150
Yes. We have to weigh them.

1572
01:02:52,680 --> 01:02:54,049
- We can do it together.
- A bucket.

1573
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:55,196
(Weighing the crushed soybeans)

1574
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:56,540
Put them in there and weigh them.

1575
01:02:56,990 --> 01:02:59,260
- We should put these over there.
- Yes.

1576
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,800
Why are you putting them in there? Use the other one.

1577
01:03:04,730 --> 01:03:06,870
- Ma'am.
- Do we not use this bucket, then?

1578
01:03:06,970 --> 01:03:09,830
We have more use for that bucket. Come on.

1579
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,899
- Dig the soybeans with this.
- I'm not in charge of it.

1580
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:13,140
(You're not fighting, are you?)

1581
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,209
- About...
- About 3.7kg.

1582
01:03:15,210 --> 01:03:17,610
- It has to be 3.7kg.
- It's 3.7kg.

1583
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:20,709
- Pour them like this.
- Okay.

1584
01:03:20,710 --> 01:03:21,749
(Add 3.7kg of the soybeans to each cloth.)

1585
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:23,149
- Tie this.
- We have to pat them together.

1586
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:24,150
Okay.

1587
01:03:24,150 --> 01:03:25,150
Put it in here.

1588
01:03:25,151 --> 01:03:27,050
(The mold for meju)

1589
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,189
It shouldn't be loose.

1590
01:03:28,190 --> 01:03:29,990
I have to tie the cloth.

1591
01:03:30,920 --> 01:03:33,290
One person should push it down over here.

1592
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:36,329
Lift it.

1593
01:03:36,330 --> 01:03:37,359
(Meju mill)

1594
01:03:37,360 --> 01:03:38,360
(When he lifts the mill, )

1595
01:03:38,360 --> 01:03:39,360
(she puts the meju in the gap.)

1596
01:03:39,361 --> 01:03:40,469
- Do I press it? I'll do it.
- Press it.

1597
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:42,470
(she puts the meju in the gap.)

1598
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:44,200
Press it with that.

1599
01:03:46,200 --> 01:03:47,209
Good.

1600
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:49,869
(Press it with the mill, so the soybeans stay well together.)

1601
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:51,880
Good. I'll hand it to you.

1602
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:53,650
(Here comes the meju.)

1603
01:03:55,310 --> 01:03:56,449
(Country members' 1st round meju is complete.)

1604
01:03:56,450 --> 01:03:58,150
That's how it looks.

1605
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,950
With the straws,

1606
01:04:00,050 --> 01:04:01,650
- we wrap around it.
- Okay.

1607
01:04:01,750 --> 01:04:03,219
- Pull it up.
- Yes.

1608
01:04:03,220 --> 01:04:04,919
- Make it stand like this.
- Okay.

1609
01:04:04,920 --> 01:04:08,090
Get about 2 to 3 strands of straws on each side.

1610
01:04:08,190 --> 01:04:10,060
- Okay.
- And pull them up together.

1611
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:14,800
Then we have meju. Isn't it pretty?

1612
01:04:16,170 --> 01:04:17,240
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

1613
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:21,040
The meju I know of is rectangular in shape.

1614
01:04:21,370 --> 01:04:22,739
Why are these round?

1615
01:04:22,740 --> 01:04:24,579
It has changed through time.

1616
01:04:24,580 --> 01:04:26,079
In the past,

1617
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:27,179
- it was shaped like this.
- Really?

1618
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:29,710
Since time has changed,

1619
01:04:30,450 --> 01:04:31,879
you can make circular ones...

1620
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,389
or conveniently make rectangular ones.

1621
01:04:34,390 --> 01:04:36,419
- This is the original version.
- It's the original.

1622
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,559
(The circular meju has been passed down for generations.)

1623
01:04:38,560 --> 01:04:39,589
I put them together and...

1624
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:42,129
(The Country members split the tasks for efficiency.)

1625
01:04:42,130 --> 01:04:43,130
Like this.

1626
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,960
(Eddie crushes the soybeans.)

1627
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:47,870
It should be 3.7kg.

1628
01:04:47,970 --> 01:04:49,730
- Weigh it on here.
- Okay.

1629
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:52,970
(Si A wraps it with the cloth.)

1630
01:04:53,740 --> 01:04:55,339
(Yo Han is in charge of the meju mill.)

1631
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:58,440
(It's not gym equipment.)

1632
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:01,379
It's like a factory in here.

1633
01:05:01,380 --> 01:05:02,826
(Congratulations on the opening of Country Family's meju factory.)

1634
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:03,850
I love the smell.

1635
01:05:04,180 --> 01:05:05,549
- It's so flavorful.
- It smells so good.

1636
01:05:05,550 --> 01:05:06,920
It smells good, doesn't it?

1637
01:05:07,420 --> 01:05:09,189
- Injeolmi?
- injeolmi.

1638
01:05:09,190 --> 01:05:10,989
- It smells like injeolmi.
- Yes. That's right.

1639
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:12,550
- Because they're both soybeans.
- Yes.

1640
01:05:13,730 --> 01:05:14,960
Let's go.

1641
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:17,229
- Sit on this...
- Thank you.

1642
01:05:17,230 --> 01:05:18,270
Or you'll hurt your knees.

1643
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:20,629
(The proud point of the Country Family's meju factory 2)

1644
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:21,930
(Overflowing love and care)

1645
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:24,370
The work is nicely divided.

1646
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:26,399
(Struggling)

1647
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,200
(But they encounter hardship really quickly.)

1648
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:29,640
It's okay.

1649
01:05:29,710 --> 01:05:31,870
It's okay so far, but we don't know it for sure today.

1650
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,679
Don't mess with it. Just do it.

1651
01:05:34,680 --> 01:05:36,449
You have to turn it like before.

1652
01:05:36,450 --> 01:05:37,450
That's right.

1653
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:41,620
Ma'am, it's hard to tie it.

1654
01:05:41,820 --> 01:05:42,949
Please tie it for me.

1655
01:05:42,950 --> 01:05:44,959
You don't have to tie it. Just...

1656
01:05:44,960 --> 01:05:47,089
Okay. Do I tie it loosely, then?

1657
01:05:47,090 --> 01:05:48,490
You just have to turn it like this.

1658
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,629
Gosh. It's too much.

1659
01:05:50,630 --> 01:05:52,470
(The factory's problem 2: Lack of hand skills)

1660
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:53,600
(Returning the soybeans)

1661
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,699
(Pounding)

1662
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:56,769
Gosh. It's hard.

1663
01:05:56,770 --> 01:05:57,770
(The factory's problem 3: Lack of endurance)

1664
01:05:57,770 --> 01:05:58,770
Okay. Yes.

1665
01:05:58,771 --> 01:06:00,139
(He even runs away from the job.)

1666
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:01,240
You have to tie it here.

1667
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:04,240
By the looks of it, it'll take all day to finish it.

1668
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:06,110
- Are we too slow?
- Of course.

1669
01:06:06,310 --> 01:06:08,879
Gosh. You do it much faster than this.

1670
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:10,109
You can't compare to us.

1671
01:06:10,110 --> 01:06:13,619
Ma'am, we might have to have dinner here too.

1672
01:06:13,620 --> 01:06:14,820
It's so hard.

1673
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:18,090
What's so hard when you haven't done so much? Gosh.

1674
01:06:18,290 --> 01:06:21,159
One can't handle this task before eating something.

1675
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
Try a little harder.

1676
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,859
How many meju do you make a day?

1677
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:29,669
- About 320 pieces a day.
- About 320.

1678
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:30,799
We make 320 blocks of meju.

1679
01:06:30,800 --> 01:06:32,200
- Gosh.
- That's right.

1680
01:06:32,300 --> 01:06:33,739
We've only made three, though.

1681
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,810
(We've only made 3 blocks, though.)

1682
01:06:36,140 --> 01:06:38,640
- They're truly amazing.
- Gosh. They make 320 blocks.

1683
01:06:38,840 --> 01:06:41,549
Our work ends at 4pm.

1684
01:06:41,550 --> 01:06:42,550
- Past 4pm.
- Gosh.

1685
01:06:42,950 --> 01:06:44,349
When do you start working?

1686
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:45,350
At 6am.

1687
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:48,149
They make 320 blocks of meju a day?

1688
01:06:48,150 --> 01:06:50,096
Gosh. We have a long way to go to pay back for the meal.

1689
01:06:50,120 --> 01:06:51,560
We have to do it until the sun sets.

1690
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:54,189
(Until they get rid of this mountain of the soybeans, )

1691
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:56,360
(they can't go home.)

1692
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,299
What are you doing?

1693
01:06:58,300 --> 01:06:59,559
Crush it harder.

1694
01:06:59,560 --> 01:07:01,006
Why are you so weak when you're a man?

1695
01:07:01,030 --> 01:07:02,370
You shouldn't do it like that.

1696
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:03,870
(Working)

1697
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:05,440
(Next meju, please.)

1698
01:07:05,441 --> 01:07:06,840
(Is it not coming anytime soon?)

1699
01:07:06,970 --> 01:07:09,009
Since you're here to work, do it diligently.

1700
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:11,109
You don't get to make meju all the time.

1701
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:12,110
You're right.

1702
01:07:12,111 --> 01:07:14,279
You're right. Thanks for the opportunity.

1703
01:07:14,280 --> 01:07:15,920
(Just keep making it as much as you can.)

1704
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:18,520
Ma'am, you're moving so fast.

1705
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:21,090
Please slow down a little.

1706
01:07:21,850 --> 01:07:23,990
(The blocks of meju are piling up.)

1707
01:07:25,190 --> 01:07:27,329
(The difference in speed between a newbie and a pro)

1708
01:07:27,330 --> 01:07:28,330
(2nd Meju)

1709
01:07:29,230 --> 01:07:30,230
(3rd Meju)

1710
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:33,699
Ma'am, please slow down a little.

1711
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,230
(A Sung is knocked down.)

1712
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:37,740
Your hands are so fast.

1713
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:38,999
- A Sung.
- Yes?

1714
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,340
This is a battleground.

1715
01:07:40,840 --> 01:07:42,739
- Today...
- Gosh.

1716
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,840
Eddie, there's no time to take a photo.

1717
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:47,449
(The one who laughs during the hardship is the winner.)

1718
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:49,450
I should take off my pants. I can't do it in them.

1719
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:53,420
- What?
- The white stuff can get on them.

1720
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:55,290
- It doesn't matter.
- It doesn't?

1721
01:07:55,390 --> 01:07:57,690
Kyun, you're doing an easy task right now.

1722
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,760
No. It's really hard.

1723
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:02,160
- Is it hard?
- Yes.

1724
01:08:02,260 --> 01:08:04,660
How much have we finished so far?

1725
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:07,769
- Not so much.
- We've made...

1726
01:08:07,770 --> 01:08:08,969
- about 319 blocks.
- About 12?

1727
01:08:08,970 --> 01:08:10,450
- Is it 12 blocks?
- It's 319 blocks.

1728
01:08:10,500 --> 01:08:13,020
- It's 320 blocks after this one.
- You haven't made that many.

1729
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:15,569
What? We ran out of the ring.

1730
01:08:15,570 --> 01:08:16,610
We should stop now.

1731
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,340
There are plenty of them over there.

1732
01:08:18,810 --> 01:08:19,986
- We have plenty of them.
- We have them.

1733
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:21,410
(Her plan has failed.)

1734
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:26,750
- We're getting better at it, right?
- Yes.

1735
01:08:26,850 --> 01:08:28,920
- Good job. You did well.
- See? Right?

1736
01:08:30,820 --> 01:08:33,120
Okay. I got the hang of it now.

1737
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,029
He got the hang of it.

1738
01:08:35,030 --> 01:08:37,459
You only need to check how much it filled the bucket.

1739
01:08:37,460 --> 01:08:39,060
The remaining soybeans...

1740
01:08:39,160 --> 01:08:41,029
won't add up to 3.7kg. What do I do?

1741
01:08:41,030 --> 01:08:42,710
There's no choice but to make a small one.

1742
01:08:43,430 --> 01:08:45,669
- We're done.
- Yes. We're done.

1743
01:08:45,670 --> 01:08:49,339
Thanks to the help from the chefs, we're done early today.

1744
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,340
Really?

1745
01:08:50,440 --> 01:08:52,509
- Should we do another pile?
- What?

1746
01:08:52,510 --> 01:08:54,010
Should we do another pile?

1747
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:57,079
Even if we want to, we can't because we have to boil the beans.

1748
01:08:57,080 --> 01:08:59,079
- Is that so?
- I got it.

1749
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:00,619
It's too late to boil the soybeans.

1750
01:09:00,620 --> 01:09:01,889
We got it.

1751
01:09:01,890 --> 01:09:03,449
(The soybeans were everywhere, but...)

1752
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:05,220
Here's the last one.

1753
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:10,189
You have to carry them there.

1754
01:09:10,190 --> 01:09:11,200
Okay.

1755
01:09:11,860 --> 01:09:13,929
Do we go up there and hang them?

1756
01:09:13,930 --> 01:09:14,930
Yes.

1757
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,470
(The meju blocks are jammed together under the roof.)

1758
01:09:19,070 --> 01:09:20,969
(The process is to hang and dry meju blocks...)

1759
01:09:20,970 --> 01:09:22,640
(with some space between them.)

1760
01:09:23,640 --> 01:09:24,840
I have no idea, Kyun.

1761
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:26,139
We can't touch it?

1762
01:09:26,140 --> 01:09:27,309
- Or you...
- Hang it further away.

1763
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:28,350
- Yes.
- Further away.

1764
01:09:29,750 --> 01:09:31,380
- Good.
- You should pull them this way.

1765
01:09:31,850 --> 01:09:33,279
- Like this.
- They shouldn't touch each other.

1766
01:09:33,280 --> 01:09:34,620
Yes. Do it like the one up there.

1767
01:09:34,990 --> 01:09:36,019
I'll get back up.

1768
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:37,559
(Yo Han joins to hang meju.)

1769
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:38,560
Yo Han, here.

1770
01:09:38,561 --> 01:09:40,989
When you hand it to me, I'll hang it from here.

1771
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:42,030
The air has to go through.

1772
01:09:42,930 --> 01:09:45,500
(Yo Han hangs meju with some gaps in between them.)

1773
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:46,600
Beautiful.

1774
01:09:48,430 --> 01:09:50,110
Give them to me. It must be heavy for you.

1775
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,540
- Why?
- I don't know.

1776
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,109
We're going to run out of space.

1777
01:09:56,110 --> 01:09:57,616
(The memories with the old ladies get richer like meju.)

1778
01:09:57,640 --> 01:10:00,140
- Ma'am, I wonder...
- Yes.

1779
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,179
- since we made lots of meju, - Yes.

1780
01:10:03,180 --> 01:10:06,019
Can we take a little bit of doenjang with us?

1781
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:07,219
- We...
- It's tasty.

1782
01:10:07,220 --> 01:10:08,490
(Good job, A Sung.)

1783
01:10:08,690 --> 01:10:10,120
Did you bring a container?

1784
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:12,490
We'll put it in here, ma'am.

1785
01:10:12,820 --> 01:10:14,429
- Did you bring a jar?
- In here.

1786
01:10:14,430 --> 01:10:16,159
- Can we take some?
- Give it to them.

1787
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,199
Our captain said, "Give it to them."

1788
01:10:18,200 --> 01:10:19,560
(The class of the captain)

1789
01:10:19,730 --> 01:10:21,900
Really? I'll give you some, then.

1790
01:10:22,900 --> 01:10:23,940
Thank you.

1791
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:25,170
(Happy)

1792
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:28,200
(They got traditional doenjang successfully with a group effort.)

1793
01:10:28,910 --> 01:10:29,910
(One scoop)

1794
01:10:29,910 --> 01:10:30,910
(Two scoops)

1795
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:32,080
(Three scoops)

1796
01:10:32,340 --> 01:10:34,249
(She gives a generous amount of doenjang to them.)

1797
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:37,920
You don't have to give us a lot. A little bit of it is fine.

1798
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:41,389
We know how hard it was for you to make them.

1799
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:42,496
(They're more grateful as they know how much effort they put in.)

1800
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:43,820
It's precious.

1801
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,160
Precious or not, a jar is to fill up.

1802
01:10:47,260 --> 01:10:48,980
It's not tasty if it's not fully filled up.

1803
01:10:49,930 --> 01:10:52,060
No. You can give us a little.

1804
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:53,630
This is so touching.

1805
01:10:55,070 --> 01:10:56,199
(The love from the country doesn't stop there.)

1806
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,500
You have an open hand.

1807
01:10:58,300 --> 01:10:59,770
Gosh. I can smell the soy sauce.

1808
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:03,170
- I have to fill it up.
- It's all right.

1809
01:11:03,270 --> 01:11:04,639
- No.
- Fill it up.

1810
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,440
Gosh. It's all right.

1811
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,079
That's good.

1812
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,150
Fill it up.

1813
01:11:09,380 --> 01:11:11,050
Ma'am.

1814
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,719
We'll enjoy it.

1815
01:11:13,720 --> 01:11:15,796
(Filled with doenjang, soy sauce, and the country people's generosity)

1816
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:16,820
(Rattling)

1817
01:11:16,821 --> 01:11:17,989
(What is this noise?)

1818
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:18,990
(Clanking)

1819
01:11:19,660 --> 01:11:21,860
(Eddie takes up the kitchen of the leader grandma.)

1820
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:24,760
(He's the one making the noise.)

1821
01:11:25,630 --> 01:11:27,599
(A Sung comes to the kitchen as she hears the noise.)

1822
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,470
Wait. What is that?

1823
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,869
I'm making some snacks...

1824
01:11:31,870 --> 01:11:32,969
- for the grannies.
- Snacks?

1825
01:11:32,970 --> 01:11:34,139
- Snacks?
- Gosh.

1826
01:11:34,140 --> 01:11:35,140
For the elders?

1827
01:11:35,141 --> 01:11:37,379
For the grannies and some of their friends.

1828
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,639
Hold on. Lower your voice or they'll hear you.

1829
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:40,710
Okay.

1830
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,880
(Is someone talking about us?)

1831
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:46,249
Yes. It's because they gave us nice doenjang and soy sauce.

1832
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:47,250
- Yes.
- So...

1833
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:48,789
To be nice to them,

1834
01:11:48,790 --> 01:11:51,259
I'm going to make some cheeseburgers.

1835
01:11:51,260 --> 01:11:52,289
Cheeseburgers?

1836
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:53,489
(Cheeseburgers as a thank-you gift)

1837
01:11:53,490 --> 01:11:54,990
And chicken burgers.

1838
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:56,530
- Right now?
- Yes.

1839
01:11:58,130 --> 01:12:00,970
We come to work at 6:20am.

1840
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:03,999
We work all day until we go home at 4pm.

1841
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,070
It's past 4pm.

1842
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:06,439
We get hungry,

1843
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,710
so we have to have something like sultteok or bread.

1844
01:12:08,810 --> 01:12:10,309
- Exactly.
- We come here early in the morning.

1845
01:12:10,310 --> 01:12:12,030
So we don't get to eat before we come here.

1846
01:12:12,240 --> 01:12:13,740
They have a very simple life.

1847
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:15,010
They're very hardworking.

1848
01:12:15,350 --> 01:12:17,679
Being a part of that and seeing that...

1849
01:12:17,680 --> 01:12:19,580
is really special to me.

1850
01:12:19,680 --> 01:12:23,989
Sometimes... I thought, "I should make them rice."

1851
01:12:23,990 --> 01:12:26,759
But they eat that every day. They're probably...

1852
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,529
Even though they love it, they probably get...

1853
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:30,489
tired of eating the same thing every day.

1854
01:12:30,490 --> 01:12:34,229
So, "Why not give them something they really don't ever eat?"

1855
01:12:34,230 --> 01:12:37,200
I thought, "Let's make really good cheeseburgers for them."

1856
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,599
Don't let them find out.

1857
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:40,870
- It'll be a surprise.
- Okay.

1858
01:12:41,610 --> 01:12:42,610
Let's go, A Sung.

1859
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:44,180
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1860
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:46,310
Let's go.

1861
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:48,610
We'll be back, meju.

1862
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:51,120
(Was my name Meju?)

1863
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,050
Will the grannies like burgers?

1864
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,689
I don't think...

1865
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:56,849
- they've had it many times.
- You're right.

1866
01:12:56,850 --> 01:12:58,890
- That's why they'll love it.
- Exactly.

1867
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:03,530
(We want to take them quickly.)

1868
01:13:04,030 --> 01:13:05,130
Here are the buns.

1869
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:09,470
Onions, buns, and...

1870
01:13:10,170 --> 01:13:12,439
It'll be better to put them in a basket.

1871
01:13:12,440 --> 01:13:13,539
Can you carry all of them at once?

1872
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:14,640
I'll try.

1873
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:17,480
In that case, I will...

1874
01:13:18,810 --> 01:13:21,279
(A Sung's box and Si A's arms are filled with ingredients.)

1875
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:22,310
Let's go.

1876
01:13:22,750 --> 01:13:23,909
Let's go.

1877
01:13:23,910 --> 01:13:25,926
(They return after getting the ingredients securely.)

1878
01:13:25,950 --> 01:13:27,849
(Making beef patties)

1879
01:13:27,850 --> 01:13:30,020
(He has already started cooking in the kitchen.)

1880
01:13:30,390 --> 01:13:33,360
(Are they cooked well?)

1881
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:37,630
(It's well done.)

1882
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,759
(Juicy)

1883
01:13:40,760 --> 01:13:43,329
Chef, we're back.

1884
01:13:43,330 --> 01:13:44,439
(Much-awaited ingredients are here.)

1885
01:13:44,440 --> 01:13:45,670
Okay.

1886
01:13:46,100 --> 01:13:48,310
- Hi.
- Hi.

1887
01:13:52,340 --> 01:13:54,010
Gosh. The patties smell so good.

1888
01:13:54,350 --> 01:13:57,179
- All right. Nice.
- Should I chop the onions?

1889
01:13:57,180 --> 01:13:58,180
Yes.

1890
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,580
- Can you...
- Yes, Chef.

1891
01:14:03,190 --> 01:14:06,059
(A thinking dance)

1892
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:07,529
Right. We're going to slice...

1893
01:14:07,530 --> 01:14:09,430
Let's slice the lettuce. I need lettuce.

1894
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,159
I'll pick five prettiest leaves and prepare them.

1895
01:14:12,160 --> 01:14:13,160
Okay.

1896
01:14:13,161 --> 01:14:14,529
Do you want to help me...

1897
01:14:14,530 --> 01:14:15,770
- make cheese sauce?
- Sure.

1898
01:14:15,970 --> 01:14:18,899
Chef, what do you want me to do with the cheese?

1899
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:20,399
I'm going to show you. First,

1900
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:22,540
we're going to make something called "a roux."

1901
01:14:23,510 --> 01:14:25,609
So, add butter and flour first.

1902
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:27,410
(Cheese sauce: 1. Melt butter and add flour.)

1903
01:14:27,810 --> 01:14:30,379
And we're going to add milk and cheese.

1904
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:31,380
(2. Add milk and cheese. Add salt to taste.)

1905
01:14:31,381 --> 01:14:33,780
Do we only need to add milk and cheese?

1906
01:14:34,890 --> 01:14:38,559
Add a little bit of salt. It's a very easy cheese sauce.

1907
01:14:38,560 --> 01:14:40,280
(An easy and simple cheese sauce is ready!)

1908
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:43,259
(The beef patties are cooked evenly too.)

1909
01:14:43,260 --> 01:14:44,960
Okay. Ready?

1910
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:46,800
Yes.

1911
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:48,270
What we're going to do is...

1912
01:14:48,870 --> 01:14:51,800
(Shall we make a bacon jam beef burger?)

1913
01:14:52,240 --> 01:14:55,639
(On top of the special cheese sauce, )

1914
01:14:55,640 --> 01:14:59,379
(a well-cooked beef patty is placed.)

1915
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:02,750
(And a slice of cheddar is placed over it.)

1916
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,050
And I'm going to add bacon jam.

1917
01:15:06,920 --> 01:15:10,590
(Eddie's beef burger's kick: Bacon jam)

1918
01:15:11,720 --> 01:15:13,659
(They've never had the bacon jam before.)

1919
01:15:13,660 --> 01:15:15,929
Please teach us the recipe, Chef.

1920
01:15:15,930 --> 01:15:16,930
That's a secret.

1921
01:15:16,931 --> 01:15:17,999
His secret recipe for it.

1922
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:19,329
- Please.
- The only...

1923
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:21,630
(As for Eddie's bacon jam, )

1924
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,200
(it's a secret kept even from his wife and daughter.)

1925
01:15:24,300 --> 01:15:28,440
At my restaurant, we use it as a topping for a burger.

1926
01:15:29,610 --> 01:15:33,510
Which is my recipe for chopped bacon.

1927
01:15:33,610 --> 01:15:36,380
I make it into a spoonable spread.

1928
01:15:36,710 --> 01:15:38,349
I add a little bit of coffee.

1929
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:39,750
(Black coffee with a rich aroma)

1930
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:41,350
Brown sugar.

1931
01:15:41,351 --> 01:15:42,826
(Sugar for the right amount of sweetness)

1932
01:15:42,850 --> 01:15:44,719
I add a little bit of vinegar.

1933
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:45,796
(Vinegar to balance the flavors)

1934
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:48,389
And all of these will turn into syrup.

1935
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:50,236
(When it's boiled down until it glows, it's ready.)

1936
01:15:50,260 --> 01:15:51,559
It's a home-made bacon jam.

1937
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:54,160
(Eddie's all-purpose sauce: Bacon jam)

1938
01:15:54,870 --> 01:15:55,870
Can we try it?

1939
01:15:55,871 --> 01:15:59,040
(How will the bacon jam taste?)

1940
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:01,270
What is this?

1941
01:16:01,340 --> 01:16:02,640
It looks very sweet.

1942
01:16:02,970 --> 01:16:04,910
No. It's not too sweet.

1943
01:16:05,340 --> 01:16:06,680
It's sweet and savory.

1944
01:16:07,380 --> 01:16:09,249
Excuse me. We're still working here. Okay?

1945
01:16:09,250 --> 01:16:10,449
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

1946
01:16:10,450 --> 01:16:12,220
I just want to have this separately.

1947
01:16:12,450 --> 01:16:14,020
Gosh. It's so good.

1948
01:16:15,690 --> 01:16:17,819
- Then add crispy onions?
- Onions.

1949
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,660
(Shall we get back to make bacon jam burgers?)

1950
01:16:20,160 --> 01:16:21,959
- And then, lettuce.
- Lettuce. Right here.

1951
01:16:21,960 --> 01:16:22,960
Thank you.

1952
01:16:22,961 --> 01:16:24,561
(Finish with fresh lettuce and pickles.)

1953
01:16:25,160 --> 01:16:28,199
(Eddie's secret bacon jam beef burger)

1954
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:29,869
This is chicken thigh.

1955
01:16:29,870 --> 01:16:30,870
(It's time for a chicken burger!)

1956
01:16:30,871 --> 01:16:32,139
- The chicken thigh.
- And put a little bit of...

1957
01:16:32,140 --> 01:16:33,639
It's chicken leg.

1958
01:16:33,640 --> 01:16:35,310
Add a little bit of flour.

1959
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:37,340
And, be careful.

1960
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:39,709
- Okay. Be careful.
- Dip it in.

1961
01:16:39,710 --> 01:16:41,610
(The chicken goes in.)

1962
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:48,750
My goodness.

1963
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:50,419
That looks good.

1964
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,789
I want to eat it as is.

1965
01:16:51,790 --> 01:16:53,090
Exactly. Let me see.

1966
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,389
- Okay. So...
- So... Chicken.

1967
01:16:57,390 --> 01:16:58,999
Okay. What was next?

1968
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,329
- It's hot.
- Bacon jam.

1969
01:17:00,330 --> 01:17:02,900
- Bacon jam.
- Okay. Bacon jam.

1970
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,469
- And then what?
- The cheese sauce.

1971
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:06,470
Okay.

1972
01:17:07,140 --> 01:17:09,740
(Adding a generous amount of cheese sauce)

1973
01:17:11,910 --> 01:17:15,010
(Finish it by putting onions that will add crunchiness to it.)

1974
01:17:22,220 --> 01:17:25,419
(Eddie's secret bacon jam chicken burger)

1975
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:26,560
Okay.

1976
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:28,660
There it is.

1977
01:17:30,790 --> 01:17:32,659
A fried chicken bacon jam...

1978
01:17:32,660 --> 01:17:34,130
- burger.
- The cheese is dripping.

1979
01:17:34,800 --> 01:17:36,029
I can serve it now, right?

1980
01:17:36,030 --> 01:17:37,030
- Yes.
- Okay.

1981
01:17:37,670 --> 01:17:39,570
Here is the next burger.

1982
01:17:40,440 --> 01:17:43,409
I'll get the grannies.

1983
01:17:43,410 --> 01:17:45,110
Okay. A Sung, in that case,

1984
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:47,439
give me five minutes.

1985
01:17:47,440 --> 01:17:48,609
I have to put the burgers together.

1986
01:17:48,610 --> 01:17:50,049
Give me about 5 to 7 minutes.

1987
01:17:50,050 --> 01:17:51,780
- Okay.
- See you.

1988
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:55,549
(Making a last spurt before the old ladies arrive)

1989
01:17:55,550 --> 01:17:57,320
Chicken burgers are ready.

1990
01:17:59,720 --> 01:18:01,530
It's a burger party.

1991
01:18:02,060 --> 01:18:03,660
A burger party.

1992
01:18:04,630 --> 01:18:07,769
(In the meantime, A Sung has come to get the grannies.)

1993
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:10,799
- Sir, do you like burgers?
- What?

1994
01:18:10,800 --> 01:18:12,269
- Do you like burgers?
- No.

1995
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:14,240
- No?
- I don't like them.

1996
01:18:14,870 --> 01:18:16,710
Where are the grannies?

1997
01:18:17,170 --> 01:18:19,479
- Are they not here? Go over there.
- Ma'am.

1998
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,210
- Over there?
- They are all there.

1999
01:18:22,180 --> 01:18:23,349
I see them.

2000
01:18:23,350 --> 01:18:24,949
(She locates the grannies.)

2001
01:18:24,950 --> 01:18:26,479
Ma'am.

2002
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,589
(The grannies are resting in a gazebo.)

2003
01:18:28,590 --> 01:18:30,519
I thought they were coming.

2004
01:18:30,520 --> 01:18:32,790
- Well... Chef Edward...
- Yes.

2005
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:36,459
Made snacks for you.

2006
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,330
Shall we go and have some snacks?

2007
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,259
- Good.
- I'm glad to hear that.

2008
01:18:40,260 --> 01:18:42,229
- How thankful!
- Let's get going.

2009
01:18:42,230 --> 01:18:44,099
Let's go and check what delicious snacks he made.

2010
01:18:44,100 --> 01:18:46,839
- We appreciate it.
- But it might be new to you.

2011
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:48,509
- Okay.
- Do you like burgers?

2012
01:18:48,510 --> 01:18:50,039
We know how to eat a burger.

2013
01:18:50,040 --> 01:18:51,709
- Do you like them?
- They are good.

2014
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:53,080
We have really tasty ones.

2015
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,650
- Let's go.
- Shall we?

2016
01:18:55,050 --> 01:18:56,979
- Let's go.
- I'm so grateful.

2017
01:18:56,980 --> 01:19:00,050
- No. I'll take the leader with me.
- Let's go and eat some burgers.

2018
01:19:01,190 --> 01:19:02,849
Let's try something new.

2019
01:19:02,850 --> 01:19:04,489
- Slowly.
- Gosh.

2020
01:19:04,490 --> 01:19:06,890
- Slowly.
- Okay. This way.

2021
01:19:07,320 --> 01:19:09,530
Do you like cheese?

2022
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:12,730
- We like cheese. We eat everything.
- Cheese?

2023
01:19:13,560 --> 01:19:14,970
They've already made some.

2024
01:19:15,070 --> 01:19:17,840
- How nice! You made burgers.
- Ma'am.

2025
01:19:18,100 --> 01:19:20,140
- Gosh. It looks good.
- We've made them for you.

2026
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,939
Please wait. I'll bring the rest quickly.

2027
01:19:22,940 --> 01:19:24,410
- Here they are.
- Gosh.

2028
01:19:24,980 --> 01:19:27,539
Here come the burgers.

2029
01:19:27,540 --> 01:19:29,980
(Flavorful beef burgers)

2030
01:19:31,850 --> 01:19:33,519
(Chicken burgers...)

2031
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,189
(that are crunchy outside and tender inside)

2032
01:19:35,190 --> 01:19:38,260
Today, we get to have Western food for making meju.

2033
01:19:39,260 --> 01:19:42,390
Right. We get to have all sorts of food today.

2034
01:19:42,490 --> 01:19:44,289
It's a Western dish if we cut it with a knife.

2035
01:19:44,290 --> 01:19:45,676
(Actually, Yo Han has been missing.)

2036
01:19:45,700 --> 01:19:49,400
Well. I have sad news.

2037
01:19:49,730 --> 01:19:50,730
What?

2038
01:19:50,770 --> 01:19:53,100
I have to go to Seoul.

2039
01:19:55,110 --> 01:19:56,910
(Now?)

2040
01:19:57,410 --> 01:19:58,510
Take me with you.

2041
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:00,140
Come on, Kyun.

2042
01:20:00,810 --> 01:20:01,810
I'll get going.

2043
01:20:01,811 --> 01:20:02,879
- We'll see each other again.
- Yo Han.

2044
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,496
- Come back quickly.
- It's not a big deal.

2045
01:20:04,520 --> 01:20:05,520
I'll call you.

2046
01:20:05,521 --> 01:20:07,120
(You have to come back, Yo Han!)

2047
01:20:07,620 --> 01:20:09,419
(Are you watching this, Yo Han? It looks good, doesn't it?)

2048
01:20:09,420 --> 01:20:10,420
Like that.

2049
01:20:11,220 --> 01:20:14,360
- Ma'am, this is beef.
- That one.

2050
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,130
Try the beef burger first.

2051
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:21,099
(A harmony created with a juicy beef patty...)

2052
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,130
(and fantastic sweet and savory bacon jam)

2053
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:27,640
(The leader takes a bite first.)

2054
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:30,270
Is it delicious?

2055
01:20:30,410 --> 01:20:32,880
(Leader, please tell us.)

2056
01:20:32,980 --> 01:20:34,209
Is it delicious?

2057
01:20:34,210 --> 01:20:36,710
(How does the hamburger taste?)

2058
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:39,349
(What does the leading grandmother think?)

2059
01:20:39,350 --> 01:20:41,290
(I can't wait to find out.)

2060
01:20:41,690 --> 01:20:43,019
- It's delicious.
- Is it?

2061
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:44,090
- Is it delicious?
- Yes.

2062
01:20:44,390 --> 01:20:46,520
(A smile of relief)

2063
01:20:47,590 --> 01:20:50,229
For an old woman living in the countryside, it's very tasty.

2064
01:20:50,230 --> 01:20:51,530
- Really?
- Yes.

2065
01:20:51,900 --> 01:20:53,659
I only eat things like seasoned vegetables.

2066
01:20:53,660 --> 01:20:54,869
I never had anything like it.

2067
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:57,029
Right? Doesn't this taste amazing...

2068
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:58,550
after only eating seasoned vegetables?

2069
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:59,840
You're right.

2070
01:21:02,240 --> 01:21:05,580
Press it down like this and take a bite.

2071
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:07,609
- Press it down?
- Eat it like this.

2072
01:21:07,610 --> 01:21:10,950
- Eat it like a sandwich.
- Yes, good job.

2073
01:21:11,110 --> 01:21:13,179
This makes it easier for us to take a bite.

2074
01:21:13,180 --> 01:21:15,249
Yes, it's easy to fit it in the mouth.

2075
01:21:15,250 --> 01:21:16,289
Like this.

2076
01:21:16,290 --> 01:21:17,650
(Taking a bite without hesitation)

2077
01:21:19,190 --> 01:21:21,330
(She knows how to eat a burger.)

2078
01:21:21,560 --> 01:21:22,660
You're eating well.

2079
01:21:24,360 --> 01:21:26,500
- It must be delicious.
- Just like an American.

2080
01:21:27,430 --> 01:21:29,069
He says that you're like an American.

2081
01:21:29,070 --> 01:21:32,400
(This is how a Korean grandmother eats.)

2082
01:21:32,770 --> 01:21:33,869
This is how you eat it.

2083
01:21:33,870 --> 01:21:35,040
It's delicious.

2084
01:21:35,510 --> 01:21:37,039
- Do you like it?
- It's delicious.

2085
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:38,210
Is it delicious?

2086
01:21:38,340 --> 01:21:40,080
(I can't stop eating it.)

2087
01:21:40,610 --> 01:21:44,620
(Foodie Si A finally gets to eat.)

2088
01:21:45,050 --> 01:21:46,150
Gosh.

2089
01:21:46,350 --> 01:21:47,920
The chicken burger is amazing.

2090
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:50,290
(A Sung also takes a bite.)

2091
01:21:50,390 --> 01:21:51,460
(Humming)

2092
01:21:51,620 --> 01:21:53,520
Don't the ingredients go well together?

2093
01:21:53,690 --> 01:21:56,660
It's both crunchy and soft.

2094
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:01,829
How often do you eat a hamburger?

2095
01:22:01,830 --> 01:22:03,329
We can't eat it often in the countryside.

2096
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:05,839
- We eat it only once in a while.
- When my son takes me to a bakery,

2097
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:07,499
- that's when I eat it.
- I eat it when he buys it for me.

2098
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:08,939
- I see.
- Yes.

2099
01:22:08,940 --> 01:22:10,569
We can't go to buy it in the countryside.

2100
01:22:10,570 --> 01:22:14,179
You eat it only when you visit your children?

2101
01:22:14,180 --> 01:22:15,709
I eat it when my son buys it for me.

2102
01:22:15,710 --> 01:22:17,326
(The hamburger feels special as they eat it rarely.)

2103
01:22:17,350 --> 01:22:19,749
Can you split this in half?

2104
01:22:19,750 --> 01:22:21,049
(I'm curious about how the other one tastes.)

2105
01:22:21,050 --> 01:22:22,419
- This one.
- Do you want to eat this?

2106
01:22:22,420 --> 01:22:24,520
I know what it is. I want to taste it.

2107
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:28,530
(Crunchy chicken with sweet and salty bacon jam)

2108
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:32,930
(Will the chicken burger receive positive feedback too?)

2109
01:22:33,760 --> 01:22:36,570
(Let me try it.)

2110
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:42,770
(The look on her face shows how delicious it is.)

2111
01:22:42,940 --> 01:22:44,779
How does it taste?

2112
01:22:44,780 --> 01:22:45,809
- It's good.
- Is it?

2113
01:22:45,810 --> 01:22:47,040
- It's delicious.
- Is it?

2114
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,510
It's so good that you can't even talk.

2115
01:22:50,210 --> 01:22:52,080
(Shall I taste some chicken burger too?)

2116
01:22:53,050 --> 01:22:55,620
(This isn't easy to eat.)

2117
01:22:56,750 --> 01:22:58,359
Ma'am, I'll cut it for you.

2118
01:22:58,360 --> 01:23:01,429
This is made with chicken thighs,

2119
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:02,659
so it's big.

2120
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:04,229
- So like this...
- Cut some for yourself.

2121
01:23:04,230 --> 01:23:05,829
Yes, I'll share it with you.

2122
01:23:05,830 --> 01:23:07,600
I'll eat it after watching you eat.

2123
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:10,900
Me?

2124
01:23:10,901 --> 01:23:13,100
(A bite of gratitude)

2125
01:23:13,870 --> 01:23:15,439
It's so tasty.

2126
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,040
(It's really delicious.)

2127
01:23:18,440 --> 01:23:19,580
It's so good.

2128
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,009
This is really delicious.

2129
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:22,680
- There's a lot in it.
- Right.

2130
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:25,719
It's so delicious that I wish we could share it with others.

2131
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,650
(The taste you want to tell everyone about)

2132
01:23:27,980 --> 01:23:30,020
- The chicken burger is excellent.
- Yes.

2133
01:23:30,220 --> 01:23:31,489
I love it.

2134
01:23:31,490 --> 01:23:33,920
(Relieved by positive feedback, Eddie eats comfortably.)

2135
01:23:35,090 --> 01:23:37,659
The bacon jam is really good.

2136
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:40,060
(Foodie Si A's evaluation: Bacon jam is a stroke of genius.)

2137
01:23:40,960 --> 01:23:43,030
(Using both hands)

2138
01:23:44,570 --> 01:23:45,640
It's good.

2139
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:47,270
Have some more.

2140
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:49,270
(She eats while feeding her.)

2141
01:23:49,310 --> 01:23:50,710
How pretty.

2142
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,109
It's delicious.

2143
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:53,640
- You're pretty.
- It's delicious.

2144
01:23:53,910 --> 01:23:56,410
- Thank you.
- How pretty.

2145
01:23:58,120 --> 01:24:01,620
(All flavors in one go)

2146
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:03,120
This is good.

2147
01:24:03,790 --> 01:24:06,360
(She only eats the patty.)

2148
01:24:08,660 --> 01:24:11,859
I'm so glad that the ladies like hamburgers...

2149
01:24:11,860 --> 01:24:13,200
more than we expected.

2150
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:20,040
You served us a wonderful lunch today,

2151
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:25,310
so I wanted to make you an American dish.

2152
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:27,410
What do you think?

2153
01:24:27,580 --> 01:24:29,709
- It's very delicious.
- I enjoyed it.

2154
01:24:29,710 --> 01:24:31,780
I had a great time.

2155
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,049
Thank you.

2156
01:24:33,050 --> 01:24:34,919
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2157
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,119
It was amazing.

2158
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:37,890
(Thank you.)

2159
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,689
(Today was another perfect day.)

2160
01:24:40,690 --> 01:24:43,329
- Si A, are you crying?
- No, I was doing something.

2161
01:24:43,330 --> 01:24:44,390
What's wrong?

2162
01:24:44,930 --> 01:24:46,410
- What's wrong?
- It's such a bummer.

2163
01:24:48,800 --> 01:24:50,199
Don't tell them.

2164
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,500
- She's crying.
- A Sung.

2165
01:24:52,140 --> 01:24:53,140
Why are you crying?

2166
01:24:53,300 --> 01:24:54,810
She feels bummed out.

2167
01:24:55,470 --> 01:24:56,570
Why are you crying?

2168
01:24:57,840 --> 01:24:59,140
You can come back next time.

2169
01:24:59,980 --> 01:25:01,910
Goodness.

2170
01:25:05,380 --> 01:25:06,920
She can't leave like this.

2171
01:25:08,220 --> 01:25:09,489
She's making me cry too.

2172
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:11,020
Grandmother, are you crying too?

2173
01:25:14,060 --> 01:25:17,130
(The leading grandmother got close to them in a short period of time.)

2174
01:25:17,190 --> 01:25:19,360
- I'll come back.
- What's the matter?

2175
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:24,800
Grandmother, I had a good time today.

2176
01:25:25,900 --> 01:25:27,470
Come back next year.

2177
01:25:27,570 --> 01:25:29,409
Please stay healthy.

2178
01:25:29,410 --> 01:25:30,709
She's really crying.

2179
01:25:30,710 --> 01:25:31,779
Don't cry.

2180
01:25:31,780 --> 01:25:33,839
(Don't cry, Si A.)

2181
01:25:33,840 --> 01:25:36,450
Grandmother, I'm leaving.

2182
01:25:40,550 --> 01:25:42,320
Don't forget to take off your pants.

2183
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,190
Oh, right. Your sweater.

2184
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,960
Were you going to steal her pants?

2185
01:25:46,560 --> 01:25:48,890
He's the typical T type.

2186
01:25:49,590 --> 01:25:52,560
- This is all because of you.
- I'm sorry.

2187
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:54,030
Why you...

2188
01:25:54,730 --> 01:25:56,770
It's my fault. I know.

2189
01:25:57,600 --> 01:25:59,369
I'm sorry.

2190
01:25:59,370 --> 01:26:01,016
(There were laughter and tears during their visit in Meju Village.)

2191
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,710
Being so gentle and so nice...

2192
01:26:06,110 --> 01:26:07,679
They have a really hard life,

2193
01:26:07,680 --> 01:26:09,679
but they have so much laughter and joy inside them.

2194
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,179
It almost killed me.

2195
01:26:11,180 --> 01:26:13,380
It was really touching.

2196
01:26:15,090 --> 01:26:18,660
I'm really fortunate that I get to spend time with them.

2197

2198

(The best ingredients you can only taste in Yeosu)

2201
01:26:28,969 --> 01:26:30,568
(The stone crab is very hard, so be careful.)

2202
01:26:30,569 --> 01:26:32,269
(He doesn't hear her.)

2203
01:26:32,399 --> 01:26:34,039
(He has an explosive appetite.)

2204
01:26:34,399 --> 01:26:36,639
(Various dishes that put them in a trance)

2205
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:40,109
(One more bowl of rice)

2206
01:26:40,409 --> 01:26:42,489
(An unfamiliar man next to A Sung who isn't Yo Han?)

2207
01:26:42,649 --> 01:26:44,208
(Special guest in Yeosu, Yoon Du Jun)

2208
01:26:44,209 --> 01:26:45,279
Is it possible?

2209
01:26:45,319 --> 01:26:48,019
(Foodie Si A on Country Cook and the legendary eater meet.)

2210
01:26:48,489 --> 01:26:49,748

2211
01:26:49,749 --> 01:26:51,248
(This is amazing.)

2212
01:26:51,249 --> 01:26:54,159
(The foodie mates fall in love with Yeosu's generous meals.)

2213
01:26:55,129 --> 01:26:56,235
(Is it another special guest?)

2214
01:26:56,259 --> 01:26:57,989
- I'll add the scallions.
- I'll do it.

2215
01:26:58,829 --> 01:26:59,899
(Sir?)

2216
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,169
(Bae Jung Nam appears as Eddie's new assistant.)

2217
01:27:02,329 --> 01:27:03,669
Can you find some salt?

01:27:03,729 --> 01:27:05,168
(Jung Nam is after Yo Han's place.)

2219
01:27:05,169 --> 01:27:06,439
Aren't I fast?

2220
01:27:06,799 --> 01:27:08,139
I'm going to Washington.

2221
01:27:08,539 --> 01:27:10,639
(I'll defend my place next to Eddie.)

2222
01:27:11,369 --> 01:27:14,039
(You don't have a chance, you brat.)

2223
01:27:14,109 --> 01:27:15,808
(The special guest livens up the mood.)

2224
01:27:15,809 --> 01:27:18,049
(The Country members' trip becomes more fun.)

2225
01:27:18,949 --> 01:27:20,625
(Where did he arrive instead of going to Washington?)

2226
01:27:20,649 --> 01:27:22,149
(Gosh, this is...)

2227
01:27:22,189 --> 01:27:25,119

(Yeosu ingredients found underwater)

2232
01:27:37,669 --> 01:27:41,809
(The rich smell of the sea that you enjoy on a boat)

2233
01:27:43,009 --> 01:27:44,408
This is great.

2234
01:27:44,409 --> 01:27:47,409
