1
00:00:33,438 --> 00:00:35,608
(The first destination, Gangwon Province)

2
00:00:35,748 --> 00:00:37,878
(Gangneung)

3
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:43,318
(Pyeongchang)

4
00:00:43,511 --> 00:00:47,851
(Jeongseon)

5
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,168
(The second destination, North Gyeongsang Province)

6
00:00:50,428 --> 00:00:56,598
(Andong)

7
00:00:56,828 --> 00:01:01,568
(Yecheon)

8
00:01:01,768 --> 00:01:04,108
(Where will they go for the finale?)

9
00:01:04,778 --> 00:01:07,378
(The last destination, Yeosu, South Jeolla Province)

10
00:01:08,048 --> 00:01:09,877
- I call Yeosu.
- Yeosu.

11
00:01:09,878 --> 00:01:12,048
(Yo Han signed up to be the Yeosu guide.)

12
00:01:12,118 --> 00:01:13,847
When we filmed "The Book of Fish,"

13
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:17,688
we were basically stuck in Jeolla Province.

14
00:01:18,788 --> 00:01:21,758
(We followed Yo Han to Yeosu, the land of delicious food.)

15
00:01:21,888 --> 00:01:23,558
It was eye-opening to me.

16
00:01:24,858 --> 00:01:28,128
(Meals of South Jeolla Province bursting with flavors)

17
00:01:29,698 --> 00:01:34,868
(Impressive ingredients that will inspire Eddie)

18
00:01:38,908 --> 00:01:40,207
(How did they make this?)

19
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,648
(You said you'd only have one bite.)

20
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:43,378
(A feast of addictive Yeosu foods)

21
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:46,948
(And a special, can't-miss experience!)

22
00:01:48,948 --> 00:01:49,948
(Oh, my!)

23
00:01:52,188 --> 00:01:54,388
(Their trip to Yeosu satisfied all five senses.)

24
00:01:55,288 --> 00:01:58,198
(Gifts of nature they found in the Yeosu ocean)

25
00:01:58,858 --> 00:02:02,328
(This is the true, fresh taste of the sea!)

26
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:05,028
(Yeosu and the romantic ocean with the Country Family)

27
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:09,738
(And a special Eddie-tion meal with seasonal Yeosu ingredients!)

28
00:02:10,138 --> 00:02:16,108
(And we have some surprise guests!)

29
00:02:16,978 --> 00:02:18,647
(They will show us...)

30
00:02:18,648 --> 00:02:20,247
(a different personal touch.)

31
00:02:20,248 --> 00:02:21,248
It's a game.

32
00:02:22,288 --> 00:02:24,787
(They are bursting...)

33
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:26,588
(with chemistry.)

34
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:29,358
(Another fun and energetic day thanks to the guests)

35
00:02:30,758 --> 00:02:34,098
(First time. This feeling is a first for me.)

36
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:36,528
(Taking a big bite)

37
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:37,798
(Watch out, Foodie Si A.)

38
00:02:39,238 --> 00:02:41,484
(Since they're together, everything is extra tasty and fun.)

39
00:02:41,508 --> 00:02:43,508
(I hope you have a relaxing time.)

40
00:02:44,108 --> 00:02:47,948
(Look forward to their comfortable and fun Yeosu trip!)

41
00:02:49,378 --> 00:02:51,418
(Edward Lee's Country Cook)

42
00:02:52,318 --> 00:02:54,887
We're going to Yeosu now.

43
00:02:54,888 --> 00:02:56,788
We're going to Yeosu.

44
00:02:57,558 --> 00:02:59,287
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

45
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:01,569
(The Country Family heads to Yeosu early in the morning.)

46
00:03:03,028 --> 00:03:08,028
(What kind of tasty foods will they find in Yeosu?)

47
00:03:10,228 --> 00:03:12,137
(It's especially quiet in the car today.)

48
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:14,058
(That makes sense. Energizer Yo Han isn't here.)

49
00:03:14,338 --> 00:03:15,607
(Our Yeosu guide, Yo Han, had a previous engagement.)

50
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:18,437
So, Yo Han missed it, and now we're going to have...

51
00:03:18,438 --> 00:03:20,777
delicious marinated crab, and he's going to miss it again.

52
00:03:20,778 --> 00:03:21,907
- You're right.
- Yes.

53
00:03:21,908 --> 00:03:24,317
He's quite unlucky when it comes to eating.

54
00:03:24,318 --> 00:03:25,448
Seriously.

55
00:03:26,018 --> 00:03:28,488
(Enjoy the food.)

56
00:03:28,948 --> 00:03:30,758
I've never been to Yeosu.

57
00:03:30,788 --> 00:03:32,357
- Me too.
- Oh, really?

58
00:03:32,358 --> 00:03:33,358
- Yes.
- Okay.

59
00:03:33,388 --> 00:03:34,988
- It's my first time in Yeosu.
- Oh, my.

60
00:03:36,288 --> 00:03:37,428
Yeosu is famous...

61
00:03:37,628 --> 00:03:39,597
for bamboo rice, chueotang,

62
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:42,067
skate, gomtang, tteokgalbi, bamboo shoot, cockle,

63
00:03:42,068 --> 00:03:43,374
bitter lettuce kimchi, mustard leaf kimchi, and more.

64
00:03:43,398 --> 00:03:45,268
There is so much to eat.

65
00:03:45,938 --> 00:03:47,737
(Just listening to that is making me hungry.)

66
00:03:47,738 --> 00:03:49,707
- I'm hungry.
- I'm hungry.

67
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:52,108
I want to eat marinated crab soon.

68
00:03:52,978 --> 00:03:55,648
Can you eat marinated crab for breakfast?

69
00:03:56,008 --> 00:03:57,418
Totally.

70
00:03:57,448 --> 00:04:00,018
I often eat marinated crab for breakfast.

71
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:02,418
Si A has a lot of room in her stomach.

72
00:04:03,218 --> 00:04:05,858
I don't have a studio. It's a two-bedroom.

73
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:09,288
Si A is so lucky.

74
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:12,658
She eats so much, but she doesn't gain weight.

75
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:15,628
Actually, I've been gaining weight.

76
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:20,368
Compared to when we first started this show,

77
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:22,007
my face looks different.

78
00:04:22,008 --> 00:04:23,538
- Really?
- Yes.

79
00:04:24,138 --> 00:04:28,378
(Before, Shin Si A, After, Foodie Si A)

80
00:04:28,648 --> 00:04:30,107
- Me too.
- Really?

81
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:32,448
Oh, my gosh. My pants don't fit.

82
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:36,288
- Me too.
- I need to buy new pants.

83
00:04:36,388 --> 00:04:38,318
Mine are so tight.

84
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:42,128
- You need to do some shopping.
- I need to go shopping for pants.

85
00:04:43,158 --> 00:04:46,958
(They weren't just gaining memories. They were gaining weight too.)

86
00:04:47,368 --> 00:04:50,228
Oh, it's so pretty. Oh, look at that.

87
00:04:50,328 --> 00:04:52,537
It's the ocean.

88
00:04:52,538 --> 00:04:53,838
Oh, it's the ocean.

89
00:04:54,438 --> 00:04:56,637
(Yeosu, a cool and tasty city with a beautiful blue ocean!)

90
00:04:56,638 --> 00:04:59,077
- It's so pretty.
- It's so pretty.

91
00:04:59,078 --> 00:05:00,137
Oh, my.

92
00:05:00,138 --> 00:05:02,298
(The painting-like scenery unfolds before their eyes.)

93
00:05:08,818 --> 00:05:10,218
Oh, here we are.

94
00:05:12,018 --> 00:05:13,857
This must be where we'll stay.

95
00:05:13,858 --> 00:05:15,928
Oh, it's so cute.

96
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,457
It's this way.

97
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,428
Oh, it's so cute.

98
00:05:20,568 --> 00:05:22,868
Oh, do we need to ring the bell?

99
00:05:24,438 --> 00:05:25,438
It's open.

100
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,637
(This is where the Country Family will stay in Yeosu!)

101
00:05:26,638 --> 00:05:27,938
Excuse us.

102
00:05:28,868 --> 00:05:30,367
- Excuse us. Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

103
00:05:30,368 --> 00:05:31,438
Chef Lee.

104
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:35,078
(There's a small and cute yard!)

105
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,647
At night, we can...

106
00:05:36,648 --> 00:05:39,047
- We can cook here.
- cook here...

107
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:40,588
and enjoy time by the fire.

108
00:05:41,448 --> 00:05:43,687
There's a guitar. You're good at guitar.

109
00:05:43,688 --> 00:05:45,387
- Oh, there's a guitar.
- Yes.

110
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:46,587
Oh, you play the guitar?

111
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:48,458
Yes. Sometimes.

112
00:05:49,658 --> 00:05:52,297
(They will spend romantic nights in Yeosu...)

113
00:05:52,298 --> 00:05:55,998
(in this cozy yard and make nice memories.)

114
00:05:57,698 --> 00:05:59,938
(Should we go into the house?)

115
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:01,908
It's so cute.

116
00:06:02,638 --> 00:06:04,537
Oh, this is the bedroom.

117
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,208
Oh, my. How cute.

118
00:06:06,538 --> 00:06:07,947
(A Sung is good at guitar.)

119
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:12,017
(In this space, )

120
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:17,858
(the Country Family will enjoy their 3 nights and 4 days in Yeosu.)

121
00:06:18,358 --> 00:06:19,358
We're late.

122
00:06:19,758 --> 00:06:20,857
(Their Yeosu trip starts now.)

123
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:22,727
This is the best place to stay.

124
00:06:22,728 --> 00:06:24,358
(Their Yeosu trip starts now.)

125
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:26,857
Are you hungry now?

126
00:06:26,858 --> 00:06:28,127
- Yes.
- Okay.

127
00:06:28,128 --> 00:06:29,197
- I kept saying I was hungry.
- Should we...

128
00:06:29,198 --> 00:06:31,567
Should we make some breakfast now?

129
00:06:31,568 --> 00:06:33,167
- Now? Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

130
00:06:33,168 --> 00:06:34,407
Okay. Let's do it.

131
00:06:34,408 --> 00:06:35,767
- Let's make...
- Okay.

132
00:06:35,768 --> 00:06:37,408
A very light breakfast.

133
00:06:38,338 --> 00:06:42,807
Usually, when I eat breakfast, it's very light and refreshing.

134
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:45,347
I don't want it to be heavy...

135
00:06:45,348 --> 00:06:47,188
because I know we're going to eat a lot today.

136
00:06:47,418 --> 00:06:49,418
We made...

137
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:52,317
a type of granola. We used silken tofu.

138
00:06:52,318 --> 00:06:54,858
(We're going to use silken tofu.)

139
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:59,058
(Granola and silken tofu?)

140
00:07:00,228 --> 00:07:01,997
(I, Edward Lee, )

141
00:07:01,998 --> 00:07:04,318
(am a tofu master who survived the 6-hour tofu challenge.)

142
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:07,937
(What will be the first tofu dish he makes on Country Cook?)

143
00:07:07,938 --> 00:07:10,108
Oh, our trustworthy trailer.

144
00:07:10,878 --> 00:07:12,518
(Should we get the most important thing?)

145
00:07:12,678 --> 00:07:14,277
(Today's main ingredient, tofu!)

146
00:07:14,278 --> 00:07:17,108
- That's why he asked.
- We won't eat a lot,

147
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:19,148
so this should be enough. Right, A Sung?

148
00:07:19,478 --> 00:07:20,688
It's so heavy.

149
00:07:21,288 --> 00:07:23,917
Wait. Let's put this on top and carry it all together.

150
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,758
It's okay. Let's go.

151
00:07:27,188 --> 00:07:29,258
(The ingredients are coming.)

152
00:07:29,488 --> 00:07:32,858
- Chef Lee.
- Chef Lee.

153
00:07:33,698 --> 00:07:36,098
Perfect timing. Oh, let me help you.

154
00:07:36,568 --> 00:07:37,867
It's very heavy.

155
00:07:37,868 --> 00:07:39,238
Oh, my goodness. It's heavy.

156
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:41,937
Do you want to cut fruit for me?

157
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:43,238
- Okay.
- Here.

158
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:45,468
I'm going to show you how to cut the orange.

159
00:07:46,408 --> 00:07:48,908
- We're making it fancy. Okay?
- Okay.

160
00:07:48,978 --> 00:07:50,677
Now, you are not beginners.

161
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,747
- Make it cool?
- You taught...

162
00:07:51,748 --> 00:07:54,217
You are now intermediate chefs.

163
00:07:54,218 --> 00:07:55,647
- Make it cool?
- Yes, make it cool.

164
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:56,787
So, top.

165
00:07:56,788 --> 00:07:58,057
(The fancy way to cut an orange, 1. Cut the top and bottom off.)

166
00:07:58,058 --> 00:08:00,487
- Top. Bottom.
- Bottom.

167
00:08:00,488 --> 00:08:02,027
- Then skin.
- Okay.

168
00:08:02,028 --> 00:08:04,857
(2. Slice off the peel.)

169
00:08:04,858 --> 00:08:07,298
- So you have to follow the shape.
- Looks very fancy.

170
00:08:07,868 --> 00:08:09,028
It's so pretty.

171
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:11,597
- Okay. When you get here...
- Yes.

172
00:08:11,598 --> 00:08:14,538
You see. You take one knife here.

173
00:08:14,838 --> 00:08:17,037
Make it a V shape. One.

174
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,877
- Okay.
- Two.

175
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:22,248
We take all of the white parts off and only leave the orange parts.

176
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:24,147
- Okay?
- Okay.

177
00:08:24,148 --> 00:08:25,394
(After teaching them the technique in a simple way, )

178
00:08:25,418 --> 00:08:27,618
(Eddie gets started on the main part of the meal.)

179
00:08:29,648 --> 00:08:31,458
(Checking the taste of the tofu!)

180
00:08:31,918 --> 00:08:33,858
(This tofu passed!)

181
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:36,827
(What tofu dish will he make today?)

182
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:40,197
I like putting hot food next to cold food...

183
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:41,567
and taking it all in one bite.

184
00:08:41,568 --> 00:08:45,038
It's a really fun sensation for me.

185
00:08:45,168 --> 00:08:47,568
So I want to show...

186
00:08:47,808 --> 00:08:49,567
how tofu can be cold and hot.

187
00:08:49,568 --> 00:08:52,678
I'm going to use tofu instead of yogurt.

188
00:08:52,878 --> 00:08:54,778
- This will turn into yogurt?
- Yes.

189
00:08:54,848 --> 00:08:56,078
That must be delicious.

190
00:08:56,378 --> 00:08:57,918
This one, I'm going to fry it.

191
00:08:58,918 --> 00:09:00,077
Really crispy.

192
00:09:00,078 --> 00:09:03,117
(Frying the firm tofu to make a hot topping)

193
00:09:03,118 --> 00:09:04,687
I love crispiness.

194
00:09:04,688 --> 00:09:06,258
(Baked croissant, fried tofu)

195
00:09:06,318 --> 00:09:08,188
So it's going to be cold on the bottom,

196
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:11,258
hot on the top, and you mix it together.

197
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:15,167
What a great idea.

198
00:09:15,168 --> 00:09:17,404
(Instead of a tofu challenge, today, it's tofu paradise.)

199
00:09:17,428 --> 00:09:20,168
(A new tofu dish by the chef who survived the tofu challenge)

200
00:09:20,238 --> 00:09:22,538
- When we make this like yogurt...
- Yes.

201
00:09:22,668 --> 00:09:23,668
(How about adding lemon?)

202
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:25,508
- Yes.
- That would be good, right?

203
00:09:25,578 --> 00:09:26,578
See? Now you're thinking...

204
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:27,778
- like a chef.
- Yes.

205
00:09:28,548 --> 00:09:29,708
What should I do?

206
00:09:30,048 --> 00:09:32,718
Should I change careers and become a chef?

207
00:09:33,078 --> 00:09:35,488
- You're good at this.
- Really? Okay.

208
00:09:36,288 --> 00:09:37,388
Where is that?

209
00:09:37,658 --> 00:09:38,957
(Should I start on the cold part first?)

210
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:39,988
There we go.

211
00:09:40,758 --> 00:09:41,788
That looks nice.

212
00:09:41,928 --> 00:09:45,598
(First, Eddie adds silken tofu to the blender.)

213
00:09:47,358 --> 00:09:49,367
(Silken tofu yogurt sauce recipe)

214
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:52,937
(Blend silken tofu, Shine Muscats, )

215
00:09:52,938 --> 00:09:55,738
(sugar, and lemon juice together.)

216
00:09:56,108 --> 00:09:57,437
The switch, on.

217
00:09:57,438 --> 00:09:59,408
(Become tasty!)

218
00:09:59,908 --> 00:10:02,008
(I'm excited.)

219
00:10:04,378 --> 00:10:06,517
(It's hard to imagine...)

220
00:10:06,518 --> 00:10:09,218
(how this silken tofu yogurt sauce will taste.)

221
00:10:10,388 --> 00:10:13,088
(Done.)

222
00:10:14,728 --> 00:10:19,898
(Silken tofu yogurt sauce with maximized creaminess)

223
00:10:24,738 --> 00:10:25,967
This is a first for me.

224
00:10:25,968 --> 00:10:28,668
So I hope it works out.

225
00:10:29,738 --> 00:10:30,877
I believe in you.

226
00:10:30,878 --> 00:10:33,308
It's a really great idea.

227
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:35,477
I'm making so many new dishes...

228
00:10:35,478 --> 00:10:38,048
during this trip in Korea.

229
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:39,818
You're happy, right?

230
00:10:42,288 --> 00:10:43,388
Too much stress.

231
00:10:44,688 --> 00:10:47,088
(Joking)

232
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:49,458
So, we're going to do... Watch this.

233
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:52,558
Add granola. I'm going to add some pine nuts.

234
00:10:52,758 --> 00:10:53,928
The croissant.

235
00:10:54,498 --> 00:10:56,328
And then, add a little bit of brown sugar.

236
00:10:56,528 --> 00:10:57,528
- Okay.
- Okay.

237
00:10:57,798 --> 00:10:58,898
And then, we're going to...

238
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:02,108
toss it. Make it nice and warm.

239
00:11:06,538 --> 00:11:08,548
We're making homemade granola.

240
00:11:08,908 --> 00:11:11,547
It's like a fancy croissant.

241
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:13,947
(The key to this granola is the ripped croissant.)

242
00:11:13,948 --> 00:11:17,587
From today, everything will be chef-level fancy.

243
00:11:17,588 --> 00:11:18,618
Okay.

244
00:11:18,858 --> 00:11:20,218
No more joking around.

245
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:22,257
(The person who jokes around the most)

246
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:23,327
It's already funny.

247
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,627
All we've done here is joke around.

248
00:11:25,628 --> 00:11:26,628
Exactly.

249
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:28,374
(Our Country members can't cook without joking around.)

250
00:11:28,398 --> 00:11:29,398
(A Sung and Si A make the granola the way Eddie taught them.)

251
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,728
(No more joking around.)

252
00:11:31,098 --> 00:11:33,379
(Eddie is making additional toppings with the firm tofu.)

253
00:11:33,668 --> 00:11:35,337
(Tofu topping recipe)

254
00:11:35,338 --> 00:11:37,067
(Remove moisture from the tofu and crush it with your hands.)

255
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,838
(Mix it in corn starch and deep fry it.)

256
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:41,107
- Tofu.
- You're going to fry it now?

257
00:11:41,108 --> 00:11:42,478
All right. Let's see.

258
00:11:43,008 --> 00:11:45,748
(You've never seen a fried tofu topping before, right?)

259
00:11:48,088 --> 00:11:49,117
That looks delicious.

260
00:11:49,118 --> 00:11:50,747
(A creative way to use firm tofu!)

261
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:52,548
(He really is the best at cooking with tofu.)

262
00:11:52,988 --> 00:11:55,148
You said this was your first time cooking this, right?

263
00:11:55,828 --> 00:11:58,058
Actually, I made this once...

264
00:11:58,328 --> 00:12:01,828
Sometimes in the kitchen, we say, "Happy accidents."

265
00:12:02,098 --> 00:12:03,428
- "Happy accidents?" - I see.

266
00:12:03,698 --> 00:12:05,238
- A happy accident?
- Yes.

267
00:12:05,438 --> 00:12:07,168
- I was in my kitchen.
- Okay.

268
00:12:07,838 --> 00:12:09,808
Someone accidentally added corn starch.

269
00:12:11,508 --> 00:12:13,608
I didn't know he put the corn starch in there.

270
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,008
"This is wrong. Something's wrong."

271
00:12:16,408 --> 00:12:19,278
"Oh, I'm sorry. I put corn starch."

272
00:12:19,478 --> 00:12:22,448
I got mad at him, but then I said, "Oh, actually, it's good."

273
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:24,587
(A wonderful flavor created by accident)

274
00:12:24,588 --> 00:12:26,757
It was an accident, but it ended up being good.

275
00:12:26,758 --> 00:12:28,757
- It's called, "Happy accident." - Happy accident.

276
00:12:28,758 --> 00:12:30,458
In Korea, we call that...

277
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:34,998
(Someone is approaching the house with happy footsteps.)

278
00:12:35,528 --> 00:12:36,768
I guess it lights up.

279
00:12:37,738 --> 00:12:39,337
(Peeking inside)

280
00:12:39,338 --> 00:12:40,697
- If someone makes a mistake...
- Yes.

281
00:12:40,698 --> 00:12:42,368
- "That's actually great." - Yes.

282
00:12:42,668 --> 00:12:44,478
How can I explain, "That's actually great?"

283
00:12:46,278 --> 00:12:47,278
Should I go in?

284
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:48,278
(Hesitating)

285
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:55,131
(You can tell he's handsome just from his feet!)

286
00:12:57,517 --> 00:12:58,517
Should I go in?

287
00:13:01,017 --> 00:13:03,257
(You can tell he's handsome just from his feet!)

288
00:13:04,057 --> 00:13:07,557
(Today's special guest)

289
00:13:08,427 --> 00:13:09,826
(The leader of HIGHLIGHT)

290
00:13:09,827 --> 00:13:11,727
(The original boyfriend idol)

291
00:13:12,297 --> 00:13:14,237
(Singer and Actor Yoon Du Jun)

292
00:13:15,397 --> 00:13:18,537
(A foodie that can rival our Foodie Si A)

293
00:13:20,437 --> 00:13:22,997
(And a skilled cook that will make our Country members nervous!)

294
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:29,546
(Why did you come to Country Cook?)

295
00:13:29,835 --> 00:13:32,905
Firstly, I wanted to meet Chef Lee.

296
00:13:33,075 --> 00:13:35,774
I watched "Culinary Class Wars" over ten times.

297
00:13:35,775 --> 00:13:37,404
I actually still watch it when I eat.

298
00:13:37,405 --> 00:13:39,175
I just turn on a random episode.

299
00:13:39,475 --> 00:13:41,284
When he won the tofu challenge...

300
00:13:41,285 --> 00:13:44,115
and threw his towel to celebrate.

301
00:13:44,415 --> 00:13:46,255
That was his coolest moment.

302
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:47,985
(A successful fan)

303
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:49,725
Hello.

304
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:51,125
- Oh, my.
- Hello.

305
00:13:51,126 --> 00:13:52,355
- Hello.
- Hello.

306
00:13:52,855 --> 00:13:53,895
Hello.

307
00:13:54,395 --> 00:13:56,294
(Du Jun is here.)

308
00:13:56,295 --> 00:13:57,694
- Hello.
- Hello.

309
00:13:57,695 --> 00:13:59,365
- Oh, is he our special guest?
- Yes.

310
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:01,564
- How are you?
- Fine. Thank you.

311
00:14:01,565 --> 00:14:02,805
(I'm fine. Thank you. And you?)

312
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:04,065
Oh, my.

313
00:14:04,066 --> 00:14:05,104
(Oh, my. It's Yoon Du Jun.)

314
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,174
- Can I come in?
- Yes.

315
00:14:06,175 --> 00:14:07,275
Yes, come in.

316
00:14:08,175 --> 00:14:09,574
- Oh, my.
- I'm such a fan.

317
00:14:09,575 --> 00:14:11,245
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Not at all.

318
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,744
He's a very famous singer...

319
00:14:13,745 --> 00:14:15,114
and actor in Korea.

320
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,884
- Come. Enjoy. Join us.
- Thank you.

321
00:14:16,885 --> 00:14:17,914
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

322
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:19,284
- Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

323
00:14:19,285 --> 00:14:20,285
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

324
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:22,526
- My hands are cold.
- Oh, I'm in the middle of cooking.

325
00:14:22,785 --> 00:14:24,084
It just felt really cool.

326
00:14:24,085 --> 00:14:27,824
Seeing the person I kept seeing on TV...

327
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,565
moving around right in front of me...

328
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:31,565
felt unreal in a way.

329
00:14:32,235 --> 00:14:36,205
I thought I wanted to get close to him soon.

330
00:14:37,405 --> 00:14:38,904
- You can put your stuff there.
- Okay.

331
00:14:38,905 --> 00:14:40,205
Can I put it anywhere?

332
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:41,674
- Yes.
- You can put it anywhere.

333
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:42,905
Did you sleep here?

334
00:14:43,105 --> 00:14:44,574
No, we just got here today too.

335
00:14:44,575 --> 00:14:45,644
- Oh, you just got here.
- Yes.

336
00:14:45,645 --> 00:14:46,774
- Chef.
- What?

337
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:48,614
- He's very famous.
- Okay.

338
00:14:48,615 --> 00:14:49,914
Don't burn the...

339
00:14:49,915 --> 00:14:51,814
Okay.

340
00:14:51,815 --> 00:14:52,985
What?

341
00:14:53,255 --> 00:14:55,255
- Oh, my.
- Okay.

342
00:14:55,925 --> 00:14:58,055
The bread was all burning while she was greeting you.

343
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,695
- Chef. I'm shy.
- We'll use the ingredients here...

344
00:15:00,895 --> 00:15:02,094
- to cook our meals.
- Don't say anything.

345
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:03,794
(Why is Si A being so shy?)

346
00:15:03,795 --> 00:15:05,694
As you know, he was very popular...

347
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,104
when I was in middle school and high school.

348
00:15:08,105 --> 00:15:10,441
So I know him very well, and I listened to his songs a lot.

349
00:15:10,465 --> 00:15:11,835
I always...

350
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:14,945
rooted for him. I was a fan.

351
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:19,344
(The popular idol from back then...)

352
00:15:19,345 --> 00:15:21,074
(and a shy fangirl)

353
00:15:21,075 --> 00:15:23,244
- It feels awkward, right?
- So awkward.

354
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:24,385
I just got here and...

355
00:15:26,485 --> 00:15:28,554
Do you want to try one of these?

356
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:29,684
- Can I?
- Yes.

357
00:15:29,685 --> 00:15:31,555
We made granola.

358
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,754
- Oh, it's bread.
- Yes, a croissant.

359
00:15:33,755 --> 00:15:34,864
It's tasty.

360
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:35,865
- It's so tasty.
- Is it?

361
00:15:35,866 --> 00:15:37,294
- It's nice and sweet.
- Right?

362
00:15:37,295 --> 00:15:38,495
(I'm glad you like it.)

363
00:15:39,865 --> 00:15:42,264
(You kids can have fun.)

364
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:44,505
(Dad will keep cooking.)

365
00:15:45,475 --> 00:15:48,005
(Straining the fried firm tofu)

366
00:15:49,145 --> 00:15:50,544
- Salt.
- Okay.

367
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:53,374
(And finishing up with salt and sugar)

368
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,475
And then, toss.

369
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:57,214
And actually, I'm going to add a bit of sugar.

370
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:58,384
(Is there something I can do?)

371
00:15:58,385 --> 00:15:59,815
- Please. Come here.
- Okay.

372
00:16:00,185 --> 00:16:01,324
I need you to work.

373
00:16:01,325 --> 00:16:03,024
- Okay.
- Take this...

374
00:16:03,025 --> 00:16:04,824
- You need to give him work.
- and do this.

375
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:05,825
- Shred it finely?
- Yes.

376
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:07,195
Yes. Pull it apart.

377
00:16:07,595 --> 00:16:09,095
- Okay.
- Go ahead.

378
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,295
- Very fine?
- Yes.

379
00:16:11,995 --> 00:16:13,734
You should make it...

380
00:16:13,735 --> 00:16:15,165
- granola-sized.
- Okay.

381
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:16,404
I'm going to do...

382
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:17,904
Did you even taste this one yet?

383
00:16:17,905 --> 00:16:19,175
Taste this.

384
00:16:20,235 --> 00:16:21,244
- Taste test this.
- Here.

385
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:22,344
- Taste... Go ahead.
- Go ahead.

386
00:16:22,345 --> 00:16:23,404
- Go ahead.
- It's okay.

387
00:16:23,405 --> 00:16:25,044
- You're our guest.
- You just got here,

388
00:16:25,045 --> 00:16:26,215
so please have a taste.

389
00:16:26,375 --> 00:16:28,545
Try to guess what's in here.

390
00:16:28,845 --> 00:16:29,944
Shine Muscat.

391
00:16:29,945 --> 00:16:30,945
(Oh, my.)

392
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:33,385
It's sweet. Did you add a bit of sugar?

393
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:35,385
- Did you add sugar?
- Of course.

394
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:37,385
(Correct!)

395
00:16:38,225 --> 00:16:39,254
Try it too.

396
00:16:39,255 --> 00:16:41,425
Tofu. It tastes like tofu.

397
00:16:42,465 --> 00:16:43,694
(100 percent accuracy, Totally satisfied)

398
00:16:43,695 --> 00:16:45,335
- Yes. Very impressive.
- Tofu.

399
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:47,094
- This is delicious.
- You're really good.

400
00:16:47,095 --> 00:16:48,764
- Silken tofu.
- Silken tofu.

401
00:16:48,765 --> 00:16:49,804
Silken tofu.

402
00:16:49,805 --> 00:16:50,904
(You used silken tofu?)

403
00:16:50,905 --> 00:16:52,604
I didn't think...

404
00:16:52,605 --> 00:16:55,104
there would be silken tofu in it.

405
00:16:55,105 --> 00:16:56,645
But when I tried it,

406
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:59,645
I could taste that unique taste...

407
00:16:59,815 --> 00:17:03,585
that tofu has. It was really cool.

408
00:17:03,685 --> 00:17:06,155
It didn't look like it at all,

409
00:17:06,385 --> 00:17:08,385
but I could really taste the tofu.

410
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:11,025
I thought, "This is a true skill."

411
00:17:11,995 --> 00:17:14,255
(It's time to finish up.)

412
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:16,694
(Instead of a tofu challenge, today, it's tofu paradise.)

413
00:17:16,695 --> 00:17:18,164
(Add lemon juice on top of the silken tofu...)

414
00:17:18,165 --> 00:17:19,665
(and spoon it into the bowls.)

415
00:17:23,665 --> 00:17:25,174
And then, this is the fun part.

416
00:17:25,175 --> 00:17:26,774
(On top of the silken tofu, )

417
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:27,904
(add a generous amount of the silken tofu yogurt sauce.)

418
00:17:27,905 --> 00:17:29,845
Decorate it with some fruit.

419
00:17:30,205 --> 00:17:32,244
I love the color combination.

420
00:17:32,245 --> 00:17:34,744
(Add colorful fruit toppings of your choosing.)

421
00:17:34,745 --> 00:17:37,285
So, on the bottom,

422
00:17:37,545 --> 00:17:39,214
we have something cold.

423
00:17:39,215 --> 00:17:42,184
- I see.
- So we're going to add...

424
00:17:42,185 --> 00:17:43,585
something hot on top.

425
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:47,255
(Warm toppings on top of cold tofu)

426
00:17:48,465 --> 00:17:51,295
(Add granola and fried firm tofu.)

427
00:17:53,265 --> 00:17:54,365
Look at that. So pretty.

428
00:17:55,035 --> 00:17:56,035
It's so pretty.

429
00:17:58,405 --> 00:18:00,334
(Instead of a tofu challenge, today, it's tofu paradise.)

430
00:18:00,335 --> 00:18:01,704
- Are you ready?
- Before it gets cold?

431
00:18:01,705 --> 00:18:02,745
Yes.

432
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:05,014
- Thank you.
- How should we eat this?

433
00:18:05,015 --> 00:18:06,674
- Get everything in one spoon?
- Make sure...

434
00:18:06,675 --> 00:18:09,145
you get stuff on the bottom and the top in one bite.

435
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:11,315
- All at once.
- All of it at once.

436
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:12,815
Thank you.

437
00:18:13,415 --> 00:18:15,085
(Taking a big bite)

438
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,925
(His first time tasting Eddie's cooking!)

439
00:18:18,595 --> 00:18:19,994
(Nervous for some reason)

440
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:20,995
(What do you think?)

441
00:18:21,255 --> 00:18:22,995
(It's making him laugh?)

442
00:18:23,225 --> 00:18:24,225
This is good.

443
00:18:24,226 --> 00:18:27,865
(Du Jun loves Eddie's tofu dish.)

444
00:18:28,605 --> 00:18:29,864
This is great for breakfast.

445
00:18:29,865 --> 00:18:30,865
(Relieved)

446
00:18:31,605 --> 00:18:33,634
(Si A takes a big bite too.)

447
00:18:33,635 --> 00:18:34,675
(Oh, my!)

448
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:37,205
(A harmony of satisfaction)

449
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:39,435
- This is good.
- This is so delicious.

450
00:18:39,775 --> 00:18:41,444
This is so good.

451
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:42,545
(Nodding in satisfaction)

452
00:18:43,085 --> 00:18:45,154
It feels like cheese,

453
00:18:45,155 --> 00:18:46,755
- but it's tofu.
- Exactly.

454
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:49,355
It feels like yogurt,

455
00:18:49,855 --> 00:18:51,055
- but it's tofu.
- Yes.

456
00:18:53,555 --> 00:18:54,555
(A bite)

457
00:18:55,595 --> 00:18:56,595
(Another bite)

458
00:18:56,596 --> 00:18:58,695
(He's about to eat the bowl too.)

459
00:18:59,135 --> 00:19:02,435
It looked like a yogurt bowl,

460
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:05,374
but when I ate it, I could really taste the tofu.

461
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,975
I really like that.

462
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:11,375
I want to try making it later.

463
00:19:12,315 --> 00:19:14,474
- This is so delicious.
- With the different textures...

464
00:19:14,475 --> 00:19:16,744
and the combination of hot and cold,

465
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:18,984
it tastes amazing in my mouth.

466
00:19:18,985 --> 00:19:19,985
(A delicious combination of creamy and crispy...)

467
00:19:19,986 --> 00:19:21,055
(and cold and hot)

468
00:19:21,155 --> 00:19:23,784
The tofu is made with Korean beans.

469
00:19:23,785 --> 00:19:25,555
Apparently, they're super high-grade beans.

470
00:19:25,755 --> 00:19:27,694
When I tried it, it was so nutty,

471
00:19:27,695 --> 00:19:29,565
creamy, and delicious.

472
00:19:30,165 --> 00:19:32,034
When I think of that tofu,

473
00:19:32,035 --> 00:19:33,894
I still want to eat it as a midnight snack.

474
00:19:33,895 --> 00:19:35,635
Because it's not fattening either.

475
00:19:36,465 --> 00:19:37,635
I'm salivating.

476
00:19:39,205 --> 00:19:41,475
(Proud)

477
00:19:41,545 --> 00:19:44,144
- This is so delicious.
- It's better than I thought.

478
00:19:44,145 --> 00:19:45,851
(An excellent way to express how good it tastes)

479
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:46,944
Oh, my.

480
00:19:46,945 --> 00:19:48,074
(Just looking at each other's faces makes them laugh now.)

481
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:50,185
Oh, protect our actress.

482
00:19:50,585 --> 00:19:52,685
You spat at me.

483
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:58,295
(It was so delicious that I...)

484
00:19:58,325 --> 00:19:59,854
I see you grew very close.

485
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:01,925
Yes, so close.

486
00:20:02,095 --> 00:20:03,895
(Real family vibes)

487
00:20:04,365 --> 00:20:06,394
What kind of things...

488
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:07,635
- will you do today?
- Today...

489
00:20:08,205 --> 00:20:09,365
- First...
- Marinated crab.

490
00:20:09,735 --> 00:20:10,735
Marinated crab.

491
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,505
(Serious)

492
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,674
- Right.
- I was...

493
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:17,504
just about to explain, Chef,

494
00:20:17,505 --> 00:20:19,815
- to our new guest...
- I was so excited.

495
00:20:19,915 --> 00:20:21,274
Oh, do you like marinated crab?

496
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:22,585
He does.

497
00:20:23,445 --> 00:20:25,254
A lot of us are waiting for the marinated crab.

498
00:20:25,255 --> 00:20:26,984
- I really like marinated crab too.
- Really?

499
00:20:26,985 --> 00:20:28,555
- You too, right?
- I love it.

500
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:30,855
We've been waiting for marinated crab. For this day.

501
00:20:31,555 --> 00:20:32,624
For this day?

502
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,754
What kind of food do you like?

503
00:20:34,755 --> 00:20:36,524
- I like most foods.
- Really?

504
00:20:36,525 --> 00:20:37,924
You eat well.

505
00:20:37,925 --> 00:20:39,365
(I can tell that he eats well.)

506
00:20:39,465 --> 00:20:40,835
I like eating.

507
00:20:42,065 --> 00:20:44,005
Is he my rival?

508
00:20:44,705 --> 00:20:46,035
(Rival?)

509
00:20:46,475 --> 00:20:47,704
I'm the best eater...

510
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:49,305
- in this group.
- I see.

511
00:20:49,975 --> 00:20:51,574
- Do you eat a lot?
- She eats five meals a day.

512
00:20:51,575 --> 00:20:53,015
I can't eat a lot.

513
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:54,945
I eat fast.

514
00:20:55,415 --> 00:20:57,244
(Evaluation complete)

515
00:20:57,245 --> 00:20:58,854
Let's have...

516
00:20:58,855 --> 00:20:59,984
- an eating competition today.
- Yes, let's do it.

517
00:20:59,985 --> 00:21:01,585
Okay. Sounds good.

518
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:04,124
- She looks so serious.
- Okay. Sounds good.

519
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:05,171
(Du Jun awakened Foodie Si A's pride.)

520
00:21:05,195 --> 00:21:07,454
You can't lose in an eating competition.

521
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,595
Okay.

522
00:21:08,665 --> 00:21:10,294
I'm going to eat five marinated crabs today.

523
00:21:10,295 --> 00:21:11,795
(Can you do that?)

524
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,464
- They're stone crabs. Just five.
- The small crabs?

525
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:16,135
Yes. That's easy.

526
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:17,604
- Oh, my.
- Okay.

527
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:18,605
(Excited)

528
00:21:19,035 --> 00:21:21,335
(An eating competition at a marinated crab restaurant...)

529
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:23,605
(in Yeosu, Si A versus Du Jun)

530
00:21:23,775 --> 00:21:26,375
(Eating mates Si A and Du Jun)

531
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:29,105
(There's no time for rivalry when there is delicious food.)

532
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:31,955
(Yesterday's rivals become today's eating mates.)

533
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:34,214
(When Du Jun eats, )

534
00:21:34,215 --> 00:21:35,624
(Si A has a bite too.)

535
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:36,625
(Foodie)

536
00:21:36,626 --> 00:21:38,066
(This time, eating at the same time)

537
00:21:38,655 --> 00:21:41,255
(Look forward to our new Foodie Siblings' chemistry.)

538
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:44,964
That was great.

539
00:21:44,965 --> 00:21:46,295
Thank you.

540
00:21:47,165 --> 00:21:48,904
I really enjoyed that, so I'll do the dishes.

541
00:21:48,905 --> 00:21:50,764
It's okay.

542
00:21:50,765 --> 00:21:52,681
- It's okay.
- That's not how we do things here.

543
00:21:52,705 --> 00:21:54,604
I'd be happy if you did the dishes.

544
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,875
It'll be quick.

545
00:21:56,875 --> 00:21:59,414
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

546
00:21:59,415 --> 00:22:02,145
(The Country members head to the kitchen.)

547
00:22:03,945 --> 00:22:08,285
You just got here. We can't make you do the dishes.

548
00:22:08,925 --> 00:22:10,724
- We'll do it.
- It'll be quick.

549
00:22:10,725 --> 00:22:13,554
I feel more relaxed when I'm doing something.

550
00:22:13,555 --> 00:22:16,264
You know, right? It's more awkward to stand around doing nothing.

551
00:22:16,265 --> 00:22:18,294
- It's more uncomfortable.
- Yes.

552
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:19,365
(What a nice young man.)

553
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:21,235
You can rest, Chef.

554
00:22:21,705 --> 00:22:23,265
Okay. I'll save the...

555
00:22:24,605 --> 00:22:26,274
- Please give me one at a time.
- Okay.

556
00:22:26,275 --> 00:22:28,445
(Putting away leftovers, Eating the leftovers)

557
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:31,615
(The mood feels extra sweet today.)

558
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:34,775
(Yo Han will be jealous.)

559
00:22:35,015 --> 00:22:36,714
He's very handsome.

560
00:22:36,715 --> 00:22:38,155
(Compliments time after cleaning up)

561
00:22:38,385 --> 00:22:40,155
(Feeling shy at the sudden compliment)

562
00:22:40,915 --> 00:22:42,125
He's better than Yo Han.

563
00:22:43,525 --> 00:22:46,225
I'm going to tell on you.

564
00:22:46,625 --> 00:22:48,254
Isn't Yo Han really funny?

565
00:22:48,255 --> 00:22:49,724
- Yes.
- I've really wanted to meet him.

566
00:22:49,725 --> 00:22:51,425
But I've never met him before.

567
00:22:51,665 --> 00:22:53,935
Yo Han only wears sweatpants.

568
00:22:54,065 --> 00:22:56,604
He doesn't wear cool clothes like this.

569
00:22:56,605 --> 00:22:57,735
It's because I'm a guest.

570
00:22:57,965 --> 00:22:59,434
(He's so mischievous.)

571
00:22:59,435 --> 00:23:02,945
I thought he was a famous actor who would wear nice clothes.

572
00:23:03,145 --> 00:23:05,015
Every day, he wears the same sweatpants.

573
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:06,875
- Every day. Too comfortable.
- Totally.

574
00:23:07,415 --> 00:23:09,144
(Yo Han's Country Collection, Black sweats)

575
00:23:09,145 --> 00:23:10,714
(Gray sweats)

576
00:23:10,715 --> 00:23:11,955
(Navy sweats)

577
00:23:12,285 --> 00:23:13,955
(You know I love you, right, Yo Han?)

578
00:23:14,055 --> 00:23:17,084
Before we eat marinated crab, should we play a game?

579
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,524
- A game?
- A game?

580
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:19,794
Chef, do you want to play a game?

581
00:23:19,795 --> 00:23:20,795
Okay.

582
00:23:21,865 --> 00:23:23,224
What fun games are there?

583
00:23:23,225 --> 00:23:24,464
What fun game should we play?

584
00:23:24,465 --> 00:23:26,365
Do you know the word chain game?

585
00:23:26,465 --> 00:23:28,734
For example... A Sung and I will show you.

586
00:23:28,735 --> 00:23:30,105
I'll start.

587
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:31,635
This is a wallet, right?

588
00:23:31,675 --> 00:23:35,175
If I say "wallet," she needs to say a word that starts with "let."

589
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:36,805
Lettuce.

590
00:23:37,275 --> 00:23:38,304
If the word ends with "lim,"

591
00:23:38,305 --> 00:23:39,621
you can also say a word that starts with "im."

592
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:42,114
I'm not very good at Korean.

593
00:23:42,115 --> 00:23:43,844
How can I play that game?

594
00:23:43,845 --> 00:23:45,814
We'll give you several chances.

595
00:23:45,815 --> 00:23:47,054
- Let's do that.
- Okay.

596
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:48,484
- Clockwise?
- Yes.

597
00:23:48,485 --> 00:23:49,955
- Okay.
- You can go first, Chef.

598
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:51,525
"Bige."

599
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:52,525
- "Bige?" - Yes.

600
00:23:52,526 --> 00:23:55,695
"Bige?" Like pork fat?

601
00:23:56,025 --> 00:23:58,095
- "Bige?" - I meant pillow.

602
00:23:59,735 --> 00:24:02,665
- "Bege!" - "Bege."

603
00:24:02,705 --> 00:24:04,534
If you make a mistake, we'll correct that...

604
00:24:04,535 --> 00:24:06,475
and continue with the correct word.

605
00:24:06,605 --> 00:24:08,134
"Ge?" "Gemi," as in "ant."

606
00:24:08,135 --> 00:24:10,574
"Gemi?" "Miguk," as in "America."

607
00:24:10,575 --> 00:24:12,174
"Miguk." "Gukganjang," as in "soy sauce"

608
00:24:12,175 --> 00:24:14,375
"Jang..." "Jangmun."

609
00:24:14,775 --> 00:24:16,614
- Oh, "jang." - "Jang."

610
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:17,844
(Du Jun: "A long passage")

611
00:24:17,845 --> 00:24:18,954
Oh, "changmun?"

612
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:20,554
(Si A: "Window")

613
00:24:20,555 --> 00:24:21,685
Oh, "changmun?"

614
00:24:24,085 --> 00:24:25,154
It was "changmun."

615
00:24:25,155 --> 00:24:26,831
(The first word chain game with a guessing component)

616
00:24:26,855 --> 00:24:29,095
- "Jang" or "chang..." - No, I got it.

617
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:30,165
"Jangjorim."

618
00:24:30,166 --> 00:24:31,794
- "Jangjorim!" - "Jangjorim!"

619
00:24:31,795 --> 00:24:33,464
"Jangjorim." So I have to start with "rim."

620
00:24:33,465 --> 00:24:35,435
Then "im..."

621
00:24:35,505 --> 00:24:36,834
"Imsin," as in "pregnant."

622
00:24:36,835 --> 00:24:38,904
"Imsin?" "Sinbaram," as in "elated."

623
00:24:38,905 --> 00:24:41,635
"Sinbaram?" "Am Center," as in "cancer center."

624
00:24:42,475 --> 00:24:43,505
(It's me again?)

625
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:45,214
- "Ter." - "Ter."

626
00:24:45,215 --> 00:24:46,514
(It feels like Eddie's turn comes around extra often.)

627
00:24:46,515 --> 00:24:47,545
"Ter."

628
00:24:49,015 --> 00:24:50,214
(Goodbye.)

629
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:51,245
"Ter."

630
00:24:51,785 --> 00:24:54,755
- This is...
- "Ter..." "Tough love."

631
00:24:55,015 --> 00:24:56,255
"Tough love?"

632
00:24:56,725 --> 00:24:59,154
(Doubting their ears)

633
00:24:59,155 --> 00:25:00,855
- "Tough love." - "Tough love?"

634
00:25:01,095 --> 00:25:03,465
- "Tough love?" - If you play this way...

635
00:25:03,765 --> 00:25:05,795
- Hey.
- That's English.

636
00:25:06,265 --> 00:25:08,164
- That's English.
- He just used an English word.

637
00:25:08,165 --> 00:25:10,304
- Anything is...
- "Teofureobeu."

638
00:25:10,305 --> 00:25:12,504
- "Teofureobeu?" - Yes.

639
00:25:12,505 --> 00:25:15,175
(They'll give him a pass since he's tough.)

640
00:25:15,745 --> 00:25:16,944
(Si A is in trouble now.)

641
00:25:16,945 --> 00:25:18,045
"Beu?"

642
00:25:19,875 --> 00:25:22,285
Back in the day, there was a song...

643
00:25:22,515 --> 00:25:24,644
Didn't you have a song called "Breath?"

644
00:25:24,645 --> 00:25:26,155
- Yes, I did...
- Right?

645
00:25:26,285 --> 00:25:27,355
"Beurideu."

646
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:29,885
- Isn't this just English now?
- It's just English...

647
00:25:30,085 --> 00:25:32,554
Hey, you're all con artists.

648
00:25:32,555 --> 00:25:33,854
A word chain game with Korean-English words.

649
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:35,624
What Korean word starts with "Beu?"

650
00:25:35,625 --> 00:25:37,265
- "Beurideu." - "Beurideu."

651
00:25:37,395 --> 00:25:39,295
- Drama.
- Drama? "Ma..."

652
00:25:40,465 --> 00:25:42,405
(A final blow!)

653
00:25:42,965 --> 00:25:44,564
"Magwi," as in "devil."

654
00:25:44,565 --> 00:25:45,674
(I'll end the game here. "Magwi")

655
00:25:45,675 --> 00:25:47,835
- "Gwi." - "Gwi."

656
00:25:47,975 --> 00:25:49,255
"Gwi Apa," as in "my ear hurts."

657
00:25:49,475 --> 00:25:52,044
No, I can't let this one pass.

658
00:25:52,045 --> 00:25:53,544
It needs to be one word.

659
00:25:53,545 --> 00:25:54,845
(Laughing)

660
00:25:55,185 --> 00:25:56,425
"Gukgi," as in "national flag."

661
00:25:56,845 --> 00:25:57,915
"Gippeo," as in "happy."

662
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,015
- "Gippeo?" - That's a bit...

663
00:26:00,085 --> 00:26:01,954
- If so...
- Oh, "ppeoggugi," as in "cuckoo."

664
00:26:01,955 --> 00:26:03,425
- "Ppeoggugi?" - "Ppeoggugi?" Okay.

665
00:26:03,725 --> 00:26:04,825
"Gireum," as in "oil."

666
00:26:05,195 --> 00:26:07,624
- Five, four...
- "Eumak," as in "music."

667
00:26:07,625 --> 00:26:09,195
- Okay. "Ak?" - "Ak."

668
00:26:09,695 --> 00:26:11,164
(Of course.)

669
00:26:11,165 --> 00:26:12,685
- "Akkapda," as in "bummer." - Five...

670
00:26:14,295 --> 00:26:15,334
- "Akkapda." - Five...

671
00:26:15,335 --> 00:26:16,535
(He's given up now.)

672
00:26:16,935 --> 00:26:17,965
- "Akkapda." - Five...

673
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:19,275
(A Sung is quite shocked too.)

674
00:26:21,505 --> 00:26:23,644
Chef is great at cheating.

675
00:26:23,645 --> 00:26:26,175
The word chain game is fun with Chef Lee.

676
00:26:26,315 --> 00:26:28,715
You're really going by how it sounds.

677
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:30,444
(If we play in English, I'd win.)

678
00:26:30,445 --> 00:26:33,685
He's tired. Chef is tired now.

679
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:36,254
That was a practice game, so let's move on.

680
00:26:36,255 --> 00:26:38,554
We'll really start now.

681
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:41,155
Okay. Then what should be the penalty?

682
00:26:41,555 --> 00:26:42,664
A flick on the forehead?

683
00:26:42,665 --> 00:26:43,964
- Oh, I see.
- Oh, a hit on the wrist?

684
00:26:43,965 --> 00:26:45,095
- A hit on the wrist?
- Yes.

685
00:26:45,765 --> 00:26:46,765
Will you be okay?

686
00:26:46,766 --> 00:26:47,794
- I'm quite strong.
- Oh, you're strong.

687
00:26:47,795 --> 00:26:48,864
(Si A shows off right away.)

688
00:26:48,865 --> 00:26:49,935
Oh, my gosh.

689
00:26:50,865 --> 00:26:52,935
- Okay. A hit on the wrist?
- Sounds good.

690
00:26:53,075 --> 00:26:54,134
Here it is.

691
00:26:54,135 --> 00:26:55,821
- There's Halli Galli.
- There's Halli Galli.

692
00:26:55,845 --> 00:26:58,205
- Should we play Halli Galli?
- Should we play Halli Galli?

693
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,844
What is this?

694
00:26:59,845 --> 00:27:01,814
We divide up the cards.

695
00:27:01,815 --> 00:27:03,445
We each flip one card at a time.

696
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:07,015
If there are five of the same fruit,

697
00:27:07,455 --> 00:27:08,954
you have to ring the bell first.

698
00:27:08,955 --> 00:27:10,054
(Rules of the fruit board game, Divide up the cards...)

699
00:27:10,055 --> 00:27:11,154
(and flip one card at a time. When there are 5 of the same fruit, )

700
00:27:11,155 --> 00:27:12,194
(the one to ring the bell first gets the cards stacked up so far.)

701
00:27:12,195 --> 00:27:14,155
So you have to be fast.

702
00:27:14,555 --> 00:27:16,094
We can't look, right?

703
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:17,825
- No, you can't look.
- Okay.

704
00:27:18,565 --> 00:27:19,565
Let's try.

705
00:27:19,565 --> 00:27:20,565
(Serious)

706
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:21,835
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

707
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:23,634
We're not holding our ears?

708
00:27:23,635 --> 00:27:24,635
Okay.

709
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:25,974
We're not holding our ears?

710
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:27,074
Oh, okay.

711
00:27:27,075 --> 00:27:32,975
(Du Jun, Eddie, Si A, A Sung)

712
00:27:33,045 --> 00:27:35,315
(There are 5 limes on one card!)

713
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:38,015
(If the next card has no limes, they need to ring the bell.)

714
00:27:38,815 --> 00:27:40,584
Oh, no. This is adding up.

715
00:27:40,585 --> 00:27:42,984
(Hyenas biding their time)

716
00:27:42,985 --> 00:27:44,485
(Is it the next one?)

717
00:27:44,885 --> 00:27:46,595
(Hands are faster than eyes.)

718
00:27:46,655 --> 00:27:48,394
(Ring!)

719
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:50,064
Oh, you're a bit sneaky.

720
00:27:50,065 --> 00:27:51,095
You're sneaky.

721
00:27:51,325 --> 00:27:56,434
(VAR time)

722
00:27:56,435 --> 00:27:58,135
(Du Jun, Eddie, Si A, A Sung)

723
00:27:59,435 --> 00:28:00,604
(Du Jun rang it first.)

724
00:28:00,605 --> 00:28:01,965
(He doesn't know what's going on.)

725
00:28:03,545 --> 00:28:05,314
Oh, you're a bit sneaky.

726
00:28:05,315 --> 00:28:07,344
You're sneaky. That was very sneaky.

727
00:28:07,345 --> 00:28:09,184
- I didn't look...
- It's all mine.

728
00:28:09,185 --> 00:28:11,614
I'm sad. I didn't do anything.

729
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:14,254
- Now, it's my turn.
- Okay.

730
00:28:14,255 --> 00:28:15,625
Oh, this is hard.

731
00:28:16,455 --> 00:28:17,455
(Getting ready)

732
00:28:17,456 --> 00:28:18,725
You can't do that.

733
00:28:18,825 --> 00:28:20,924
(This is obviously cheating.)

734
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:23,564
Hold your ear.

735
00:28:23,565 --> 00:28:25,071
- Wait. Let's go over the rules.
- Hold on.

736
00:28:25,095 --> 00:28:26,964
As long as we ring the bell with this hand...

737
00:28:26,965 --> 00:28:28,234
- Flip the card with the other hand.
- Okay.

738
00:28:28,235 --> 00:28:29,235
Okay.

739
00:28:29,705 --> 00:28:30,834
Hold your ear.

740
00:28:30,835 --> 00:28:32,404
(A Sung, Du Jun, Si A)

741
00:28:32,405 --> 00:28:33,434
It's your turn.

742
00:28:33,435 --> 00:28:35,104
- Can I do this?
- With this hand.

743
00:28:35,105 --> 00:28:36,144
Okay.

744
00:28:36,145 --> 00:28:38,274
(A Sung, Du Jun, Si A)

745
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:40,575
(Eddie)

746
00:28:41,175 --> 00:28:42,484
(My hand hurts.)

747
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:43,485
That was quick.

748
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:45,654
(A Sung secured the bell.)

749
00:28:45,655 --> 00:28:47,284
- A Sung, you're good.
- That was quick.

750
00:28:47,285 --> 00:28:48,901
(They woke up the competitiveness in sleeping A Sung.)

751
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:50,725
(I've never seen this side of A Sung.)

752
00:28:51,125 --> 00:28:52,894
- I see.
- Yes, I'm very good at it.

753
00:28:52,895 --> 00:28:54,794
(A Sung, Du Jun)

754
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:55,795
(Eddie)

755
00:28:55,796 --> 00:28:56,824
(A Sung is faster than the speed of light.)

756
00:28:56,825 --> 00:28:57,825
No.

757
00:28:57,826 --> 00:28:59,094
(A Sung is on a roll.)

758
00:28:59,095 --> 00:29:00,165
- Okay.
- Gosh.

759
00:29:01,165 --> 00:29:02,335
Oh, my gosh.

760
00:29:02,735 --> 00:29:04,335
- Have you seen "Tazza?" - That's scary.

761
00:29:04,465 --> 00:29:06,935
(Herbivores)

762
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:08,904
(On top of the jungle's hierarchy is the predator.)

763
00:29:08,905 --> 00:29:09,945
She got it again.

764
00:29:11,005 --> 00:29:13,244
(She's way too good.)

765
00:29:13,245 --> 00:29:14,815
- Okay.
- Okay.

766
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:16,445
Wait.

767
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:18,684
He's starting to use techniques.

768
00:29:18,685 --> 00:29:20,405
- This position will make it harder.
- Yes.

769
00:29:22,685 --> 00:29:24,885
(This will be perfect.)

770
00:29:26,195 --> 00:29:27,255
- Is it my turn?
- Yes.

771
00:29:27,655 --> 00:29:29,124
(A Sung, Du Jun, Eddie)

772
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,125
Goodness.

773
00:29:30,126 --> 00:29:31,395
Thank you.

774
00:29:32,435 --> 00:29:33,464
(He failed to control the distance.)

775
00:29:33,465 --> 00:29:35,564
I'll take this from you.

776
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:37,485
(The younger members quickly collect his cards.)

777
00:29:39,575 --> 00:29:40,735
You're so good.

778
00:29:41,175 --> 00:29:42,205
Goodness.

779
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:44,505
(A Sung, Du Jun, Eddie)

780
00:29:45,245 --> 00:29:46,644
- Goodness.
- Yes.

781
00:29:46,645 --> 00:29:47,875
Gosh.

782
00:29:48,545 --> 00:29:49,844
Goodness.

783
00:29:49,845 --> 00:29:50,945
- Wait a minute.
- But...

784
00:29:52,285 --> 00:29:54,514
(Meanwhile, A Sung keeps winning.)

785
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:55,524
- Gosh.
- Too fast.

786
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:57,425
- You're really fast.
- A Sung, you're so good.

787
00:29:57,785 --> 00:29:58,825
Goodness.

788
00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:04,294
(52-year-old Eddie couldn't compete against the younger ones.)

789
00:30:04,295 --> 00:30:05,295
(Empty)

790
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:06,776
All our hands were at the same place.

791
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:08,764
- I'm out.
- The chef is eliminated.

792
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,465
Whom will you let hit your wrist?

793
00:30:11,265 --> 00:30:12,375
Not you.

794
00:30:13,105 --> 00:30:14,105
(He picks Du Jun.)

795
00:30:14,106 --> 00:30:15,134
- I see.
- Are you ready?

796
00:30:15,135 --> 00:30:16,444
- Yes.
- I'll hit you gently.

797
00:30:16,445 --> 00:30:17,504
This is my left hand.

798
00:30:17,505 --> 00:30:18,844
I'll hit you gently. This is my left hand.

799
00:30:18,845 --> 00:30:20,244
(I'm counting on you, Du Jun.)

800
00:30:20,245 --> 00:30:21,275
With my right hand.

801
00:30:22,085 --> 00:30:23,085
His wrist is thick from using...

802
00:30:23,086 --> 00:30:25,385
- the knife for a long time.
- Seriously.

803
00:30:28,615 --> 00:30:29,724
It's just a game.

804
00:30:29,725 --> 00:30:30,824
(The sound is too loud and clear to be gentle.)

805
00:30:30,825 --> 00:30:32,495
How was it so loud?

806
00:30:32,955 --> 00:30:34,894
The sound was very loud. I'm sorry.

807
00:30:34,895 --> 00:30:37,425
We met only a moment ago.

808
00:30:38,095 --> 00:30:39,465
(Sighing)

809
00:30:39,695 --> 00:30:41,994
(I feel bad for the chef.)

810
00:30:41,995 --> 00:30:43,764
- How was it so loud?
- Seriously.

811
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:44,835
I'm sorry.

812
00:30:44,965 --> 00:30:46,404
- It was really loud.
- Chef.

813
00:30:46,405 --> 00:30:47,734
We're only playing a game.

814
00:30:47,735 --> 00:30:49,074
It doesn't seem like a game.

815
00:30:49,075 --> 00:30:50,275
(It doesn't seem like a game.)

816
00:30:51,245 --> 00:30:52,485
He won't be able to cook today.

817
00:30:54,245 --> 00:30:56,285
- Oh, my gosh.
- Chef, wipe off your tears.

818
00:30:56,885 --> 00:30:58,014
I'm sorry.

819
00:30:58,015 --> 00:30:59,614
(He's crying either out of pain or sadness.)

820
00:30:59,615 --> 00:31:00,615
Okay.

821
00:31:01,215 --> 00:31:02,324
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

822
00:31:02,325 --> 00:31:03,454
- Are you hungry?
- Let's go.

823
00:31:03,455 --> 00:31:05,224
- I'm very hungry.
- Let's go and eat...

824
00:31:05,225 --> 00:31:07,025
marinated crab.

825
00:31:07,325 --> 00:31:08,654
- Let's go.
- Okay.

826
00:31:08,655 --> 00:31:09,665
Let's get going.

827
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:11,464
It's a perfect day to eat marinated crab.

828
00:31:11,465 --> 00:31:12,465
The weather is perfect...

829
00:31:12,466 --> 00:31:14,586
- for eating marinated crab.
- Eating marinated crab.

830
00:31:15,295 --> 00:31:16,665
It's the spring weather.

831
00:31:17,565 --> 00:31:20,075
I can't wait to have some marinated crab.

832
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:22,544
- Here we go.
- Okay.

833
00:31:22,545 --> 00:31:23,704
(They set off to eat marinated crab they've been waiting for.)

834
00:31:23,705 --> 00:31:27,045
Let's go and eat some marinated crab.

835
00:31:27,945 --> 00:31:29,045
Gosh, look at that.

836
00:31:29,585 --> 00:31:31,115
- The water ebbed.
- It's all gone.

837
00:31:31,785 --> 00:31:34,105
- Chef, there must be a lot here.
- Is this the South Sea?

838
00:31:34,585 --> 00:31:35,755
Yes, the South Sea.

839
00:31:36,555 --> 00:31:38,125
What is that? That's not...

840
00:31:38,895 --> 00:31:40,124
Is that a person or a bear?

841
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:42,124
(A person? A bear?)

842
00:31:42,125 --> 00:31:43,165
It's a person.

843
00:31:44,465 --> 00:31:45,465
(In the US, bears can appear.)

844
00:31:45,466 --> 00:31:46,665
It's a person.

845
00:31:46,835 --> 00:31:48,034
(What is he doing?)

846
00:31:48,035 --> 00:31:50,334
He's digging out things like clams.

847
00:31:50,335 --> 00:31:52,065
(I'm digging out clams.)

848
00:31:52,435 --> 00:31:54,134
We came all the way to the south.

849
00:31:54,135 --> 00:31:56,405
(To Eddie, the sea in Yeosu is just fascinating.)

850
00:31:57,575 --> 00:31:58,575
It's so lovely.

851
00:31:58,576 --> 00:32:00,751
(Flavors of Yeosu are as infinite as the wide Yeosu sea.)

852
00:32:00,775 --> 00:32:01,974
(The first flavor)

853
00:32:01,975 --> 00:32:03,661
(The Country members and Du Jun are going after marinated stone crab.)

854
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:05,145
By the way, I have a question.

855
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:09,225
Sometimes, marinated crab is the main meal.

856
00:32:09,525 --> 00:32:11,454
Sometimes, marinated crab is a side dish.

857
00:32:11,455 --> 00:32:13,495
(Is marinated crab the main dish or a side dish?)

858
00:32:13,955 --> 00:32:15,895
Usually, people eat it as a side dish.

859
00:32:16,295 --> 00:32:18,995
You can't eat it without rice.

860
00:32:20,035 --> 00:32:22,535
So anything you can eat with rice is a side dish?

861
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:25,774
(Thinking hard)

862
00:32:25,775 --> 00:32:28,945
Basically, anything you can make into a small portion.

863
00:32:29,145 --> 00:32:31,744
The concept of side dishes is ambiguous, isn't it?

864
00:32:31,745 --> 00:32:35,245
The difference between side dishes and main dishes.

865
00:32:35,585 --> 00:32:37,615
So can anything be a side dish?

866
00:32:39,315 --> 00:32:42,185
(What is a side dish?)

867
00:32:42,485 --> 00:32:44,384
- So for example, - Yes?

868
00:32:44,385 --> 00:32:45,825
Kimchi stew.

869
00:32:46,125 --> 00:32:49,425
You have big kimchi stew and rice.

870
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:53,064
Sometimes, if you have meat with rice,

871
00:32:53,065 --> 00:32:55,765
there could be kimchi stew with other side dishes.

872
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:59,334
Basically, are there certain side dishes...

873
00:32:59,335 --> 00:33:01,105
that go with certain...

874
00:33:01,275 --> 00:33:03,504
In the US, the course of a meal is defined.

875
00:33:03,505 --> 00:33:05,675
- Appetizer, main dish, and dessert.
- Yes.

876
00:33:05,815 --> 00:33:09,614
However, even when you're eating a steak in Korea,

877
00:33:09,615 --> 00:33:11,615
it feels like something is missing without rice.

878
00:33:12,215 --> 00:33:14,785
Actually, everything can be a side dish.

879
00:33:15,625 --> 00:33:18,255
I think that it's up to you.

880
00:33:18,485 --> 00:33:21,525
See, I like eating... When I go and eat ribs,

881
00:33:21,995 --> 00:33:23,194
I like to eat...

882
00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:24,341
(What is he asking this time?)

883
00:33:24,365 --> 00:33:25,525
naengmyeon after.

884
00:33:25,765 --> 00:33:26,894
- Because it's like...
- Right.

885
00:33:26,895 --> 00:33:28,734
- It cools it down.
- Right.

886
00:33:28,735 --> 00:33:30,234
- To freshen up.
- It gets rid of the heaviness.

887
00:33:30,235 --> 00:33:31,334
(Chef, you know quite a lot.)

888
00:33:31,335 --> 00:33:34,334
Chef, in my case,

889
00:33:34,335 --> 00:33:36,275
I eat naengmyeon and ribs at the same time.

890
00:33:36,875 --> 00:33:38,104
- At the same time?
- I like to wrap meat...

891
00:33:38,105 --> 00:33:39,314
- Like yukssam naengmyeon?
- in the naengmyeon.

892
00:33:39,315 --> 00:33:40,315
Right.

893
00:33:40,316 --> 00:33:41,374
(You understand the taste of meat wrapped in noodles.)

894
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:42,614
To eat them together?

895
00:33:42,615 --> 00:33:44,975
When I go to a barbecue restaurant, I order the stew first.

896
00:33:45,385 --> 00:33:47,685
The stew lets me eat a lot.

897
00:33:48,315 --> 00:33:49,724
(That's Si A for you.)

898
00:33:49,725 --> 00:33:52,224
You must love food a lot.

899
00:33:52,225 --> 00:33:54,454
Definitely. I love it.

900
00:33:54,455 --> 00:33:55,725
What's your favorite food?

901
00:33:56,025 --> 00:33:57,694
- Usually, it's chicken.
- Chicken?

902
00:33:57,695 --> 00:33:59,055
- Usually.
- What type of chicken?

903
00:33:59,265 --> 00:34:00,335
Fried chicken.

904
00:34:00,595 --> 00:34:02,805
When I order chicken, I get it from Two Two.

905
00:34:03,035 --> 00:34:05,564
I go to Two Two Chicken and order whelk too.

906
00:34:05,565 --> 00:34:07,135
(Master of eating)

907
00:34:07,405 --> 00:34:08,905
What's your favorite food?

908
00:34:09,245 --> 00:34:10,475
- Pork belly.
- Pork belly?

909
00:34:11,505 --> 00:34:12,675
And ramyeon.

910
00:34:13,575 --> 00:34:15,045
They're the two best dishes.

911
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:16,785
Did you go to many tasty restaurants?

912
00:34:17,045 --> 00:34:18,645
- So many.
- You did?

913
00:34:19,415 --> 00:34:23,025
So far, which was the best dish you had?

914
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:25,084
(Her mouth is watering from thinking about it.)

915
00:34:25,085 --> 00:34:26,225
Everything was delicious.

916
00:34:26,595 --> 00:34:27,955
If you had to pick one...

917
00:34:28,195 --> 00:34:29,324
Recently,

918
00:34:29,325 --> 00:34:32,024
elder ladies cooked suyuk in the cast iron pot.

919
00:34:32,025 --> 00:34:33,464
They served it with kimchi made at home.

920
00:34:33,465 --> 00:34:34,634
(Gourmet Si A's first choice is suyuk at Meju Village in Yecheon.)

921
00:34:34,635 --> 00:34:35,804
It's needless to say.

922
00:34:35,805 --> 00:34:37,364
With doenjang that they made from scratch.

923
00:34:37,365 --> 00:34:39,505
We dipped some chili in doenjang.

924
00:34:39,675 --> 00:34:41,104
We had it with kimchi and suyuk.

925
00:34:41,105 --> 00:34:42,825
(Nothing can beat home cooking with suyuk.)

926
00:34:43,175 --> 00:34:44,204
I'm so hungry.

927
00:34:44,205 --> 00:34:45,814
(While chatting, )

928
00:34:45,815 --> 00:34:47,575
(they run toward marinated stone crab.)

929
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:50,615
We're here.

930
00:34:53,155 --> 00:34:54,155
Thank you.

931
00:34:54,156 --> 00:34:55,824
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

932
00:34:55,825 --> 00:34:56,884
Marinated stone crab.

933
00:34:56,885 --> 00:34:58,354
Let's go.

934
00:34:58,355 --> 00:35:00,795
(Yeosu marinated crab that Country members have been craving)

935
00:35:02,095 --> 00:35:04,865
(A marinated crab restaurant with over 30 years of history)

936
00:35:06,065 --> 00:35:09,165
(A famous tasty restaurant among the locals in Yeosu)

937
00:35:10,865 --> 00:35:12,374
(There are people who haven't tried it, )

938
00:35:12,375 --> 00:35:13,634
(but no one has eaten it only once.)

939
00:35:13,635 --> 00:35:16,105
(However, it isn't the marinated crab that we know.)

940
00:35:16,975 --> 00:35:19,774
(Stone crabs)

941
00:35:19,775 --> 00:35:21,714
The gluey and chewy taste of stone crabs.

942
00:35:21,715 --> 00:35:23,315
That's why it's more delicious.

943
00:35:24,415 --> 00:35:27,385
(It's small, but it's filled with meat.)

944
00:35:27,615 --> 00:35:29,084
Every day, we prepare the amount to sell that day.

945
00:35:29,085 --> 00:35:31,785
It's fermented 1 or 2 days before it's served.

946
00:35:33,655 --> 00:35:35,864
All the seasoned vegetables are vegetables in season.

947
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:38,764
We serve different dishes every season.

948
00:35:38,765 --> 00:35:41,695
(A meal of marinated stone crab made with a lot of love)

949
00:35:42,605 --> 00:35:44,065
- Hello.
- Hello.

950
00:35:44,535 --> 00:35:47,205
- Hello.
- Hello.

951
00:35:49,305 --> 00:35:51,005
They're eating delicious food.

952
00:35:51,905 --> 00:35:53,815
(It looks delicious already.)

953
00:35:54,245 --> 00:35:55,784
(The restaurant owner's daughter)

954
00:35:55,785 --> 00:35:58,044
- Hello.
- Hello.

955
00:35:58,045 --> 00:35:59,654
- May I shake your hand?
- Sure.

956
00:35:59,655 --> 00:36:00,814
(Holding the hand tightly)

957
00:36:00,815 --> 00:36:02,361
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

958
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:04,384
- I'll take your order.
- Okay.

959
00:36:04,385 --> 00:36:05,954
Most people order the marinated crab meal...

960
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:07,954
with braised hairtail.

961
00:36:07,955 --> 00:36:10,364
Does the marinated crab include both spicy and soy sauce?

962
00:36:10,365 --> 00:36:11,694
- Soy sauce and spicy.
- Are there both?

963
00:36:11,695 --> 00:36:13,794
- You can taste both of them.
- That sounds good.

964
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:14,795
- That's great.
- Okay.

965
00:36:14,796 --> 00:36:16,564
Can we order extra marinated crab?

966
00:36:16,565 --> 00:36:18,334
Yes, an extra order of marinated crab is...

967
00:36:18,335 --> 00:36:20,034
- five dollars per person.
- Okay.

968
00:36:20,035 --> 00:36:21,775
You'll see it on the menu.

969
00:36:21,935 --> 00:36:22,974
Soju?

970
00:36:22,975 --> 00:36:24,004
- A bottle of soju?
- Yes.

971
00:36:24,005 --> 00:36:25,344
- Do you drink soju?
- Yes.

972
00:36:25,345 --> 00:36:26,515
- Sure.
- Thank you.

973
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:28,474
(They only ordered, but they're full of happiness.)

974
00:36:28,475 --> 00:36:30,684
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

975
00:36:30,685 --> 00:36:32,045
What is "baekban?"

976
00:36:32,755 --> 00:36:34,284
"Baekban" is rice and side dishes.

977
00:36:34,285 --> 00:36:37,024
It's like a set meal including rice and side dishes.

978
00:36:37,025 --> 00:36:38,724
- It's like a set meal.
- Like over there.

979
00:36:38,725 --> 00:36:40,924
- So... I see.
- That's "baekban."

980
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:44,295
(The big table is filled with side dishes.)

981
00:36:45,065 --> 00:36:46,764
I can already smell that it's a good restaurant.

982
00:36:46,765 --> 00:36:47,894
This place is the real deal.

983
00:36:47,895 --> 00:36:49,034
(The one who knows about food is 200 percent certain.)

984
00:36:49,035 --> 00:36:50,604
Here are the side dishes.

985
00:36:50,605 --> 00:36:52,164
(The side dishes are here.)

986
00:36:52,165 --> 00:36:53,174
Okay.

987
00:36:53,175 --> 00:36:55,134
- Here's your meal.
- Are there 12 side dishes?

988
00:36:55,135 --> 00:36:56,175
Yes.

989
00:37:01,445 --> 00:37:04,085
(Seasonal namul with flavors and scents of the season)

990
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:05,584
Wrapped in the cabbage...

991
00:37:05,585 --> 00:37:07,465
Both the cabbage and salted oysters look tasty.

992
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:11,984
(Whetting his appetite with salted oysters with hot peppers)

993
00:37:11,985 --> 00:37:13,324
Can we get one Coke?

994
00:37:13,325 --> 00:37:15,155
(Humming)

995
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:16,764
That's good.

996
00:37:16,765 --> 00:37:18,485
(Wrinkling the forehead with concentration)

997
00:37:18,525 --> 00:37:19,965
- That's a lot.
- It's too much.

998
00:37:20,335 --> 00:37:22,395
(One packed wrap)

999
00:37:23,635 --> 00:37:24,734
- Gosh.
- How is it?

1000
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:25,875
(Taking a huge bite)

1001
00:37:26,435 --> 00:37:28,275
- It's really spicy.
- Right?

1002
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:30,704
(The size isn't important.)

1003
00:37:30,705 --> 00:37:32,914
(Enjoying an entire bite in a wrap)

1004
00:37:32,915 --> 00:37:33,945
It's flavorful.

1005
00:37:34,675 --> 00:37:35,844
Isn't it good?

1006
00:37:35,845 --> 00:37:36,845
Yes.

1007
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:39,015
It's flavorful.

1008
00:37:39,485 --> 00:37:40,585
It's very spicy.

1009
00:37:40,955 --> 00:37:42,784
- Ma'am, what's this?
- Which one?

1010
00:37:42,785 --> 00:37:43,825
The seasoned raw fish.

1011
00:37:43,925 --> 00:37:44,984
- What type...
- It's seasoned raw sole.

1012
00:37:44,985 --> 00:37:47,524
- Seasoned raw sole?
- Sole is famous in Yeosu.

1013
00:37:47,525 --> 00:37:48,894
- Please try it.
- This?

1014
00:37:48,895 --> 00:37:50,124
(Sour and chewy seasoned raw sole...)

1015
00:37:50,125 --> 00:37:51,365
(that's pleasant on the palate)

1016
00:37:53,495 --> 00:37:54,565
It's delicious.

1017
00:37:59,605 --> 00:38:00,735
What is this again?

1018
00:38:01,075 --> 00:38:02,574
- Seasoned raw sole.
- Seasoned raw sole.

1019
00:38:02,575 --> 00:38:03,604
Sole?

1020
00:38:03,605 --> 00:38:06,615
Sole is a type of fish.

1021
00:38:06,915 --> 00:38:09,145
But it tastes like radish, no?

1022
00:38:09,245 --> 00:38:10,484
It has radish in it.

1023
00:38:10,485 --> 00:38:11,915
You only had radish a moment ago.

1024
00:38:12,185 --> 00:38:13,514
Did you only eat radish?

1025
00:38:13,515 --> 00:38:14,914
- You ate radish.
- This is radish.

1026
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,554
- I see.
- This is raw fish.

1027
00:38:16,555 --> 00:38:18,624
(Laughing out of embarrassment)

1028
00:38:18,625 --> 00:38:19,825
Raw fish and radish.

1029
00:38:21,855 --> 00:38:23,824
(This time, he tastes some raw fish.)

1030
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:25,125
Oh, I see. This is the fish.

1031
00:38:27,235 --> 00:38:28,464
(They can't stop eating various side dishes.)

1032
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:29,765
What a twist.

1033
00:38:30,505 --> 00:38:32,804
- All the side dishes are tasty.
- Enjoy.

1034
00:38:32,805 --> 00:38:35,004
- They're very good.
- Let me know if you need anything.

1035
00:38:35,005 --> 00:38:36,074
Here you go.

1036
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:37,704
(Peekaboo)

1037
00:38:37,705 --> 00:38:38,974
Soy sauce marinated crab.

1038
00:38:38,975 --> 00:38:40,455
(Let's eat marinated stone crab now.)

1039
00:38:40,575 --> 00:38:42,815
It's marinated with spicy chili sauce.

1040
00:38:43,585 --> 00:38:44,845
Goodness.

1041
00:38:45,615 --> 00:38:47,914
And this is braised hairtail.

1042
00:38:47,915 --> 00:38:49,785
It needs to be cooked a little longer.

1043
00:38:49,855 --> 00:38:51,415
(The braised hairtail looks delicious.)

1044
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:54,825
(The marinated stone crab and braised hairtail meal is complete.)

1045
00:38:55,965 --> 00:38:58,625
(Spicy taste of the sea, braised hairtail)

1046
00:38:59,295 --> 00:39:05,135
(Yeosu's typical side dish, soy sauce and spicy marinated crab)

1047
00:39:05,435 --> 00:39:07,534
Do you start with the body?

1048
00:39:07,535 --> 00:39:09,704
- Yes, this is the body.
- That's a good part right here.

1049
00:39:09,705 --> 00:39:10,905
(Gosh, it looks amazing.)

1050
00:39:11,845 --> 00:39:13,374
- Is this stone crab?
- Stone crab.

1051
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,521
(Made with fresh stone crab from Yeosu)

1052
00:39:14,545 --> 00:39:16,384
Look how meaty it is.

1053
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:18,285
- This is how meaty it is.
- Gosh.

1054
00:39:18,445 --> 00:39:19,614
- Isn't it very meaty?
- Is it close to the pincers?

1055
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:20,695
Yes, meat near the pincers.

1056
00:39:26,355 --> 00:39:28,124
The shell is very hard, so be careful.

1057
00:39:28,125 --> 00:39:29,295
Chef, it's hard.

1058
00:39:31,365 --> 00:39:32,794
Gosh, he knows how...

1059
00:39:32,795 --> 00:39:33,995
(In love with stone crab)

1060
00:39:34,435 --> 00:39:36,335
Chef, you know how to eat it.

1061
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:38,165
(Humming in surprise)

1062
00:39:39,205 --> 00:39:41,675
(Describing the taste is a waste of time.)

1063
00:39:45,075 --> 00:39:46,075
(Humming)

1064
00:39:46,175 --> 00:39:47,444
(Everyone is exclaiming.)

1065
00:39:47,445 --> 00:39:49,445
- Gosh, it's not fishy at all.
- It's really good.

1066
00:39:50,785 --> 00:39:51,815
(Humming)

1067
00:39:52,145 --> 00:39:54,454
- It's definitely hard.
- It's very good.

1068
00:39:54,455 --> 00:39:55,554
(Everyone falls in love with stone crab at this moment.)

1069
00:39:55,555 --> 00:39:57,425
- It's not fishy at all.
- It's really good.

1070
00:39:57,625 --> 00:39:59,855
- It's amazing. What do I do?
- Goodness.

1071
00:40:00,495 --> 00:40:03,095
(Do you need to ask? Just eat it with both hands.)

1072
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:04,625
Goodness.

1073
00:40:04,765 --> 00:40:07,035
Is the meat stickier than the blue crab?

1074
00:40:07,235 --> 00:40:08,734
- It seems more muscular.
- Right.

1075
00:40:08,735 --> 00:40:10,041
(Sweet and salty meat marinated with soy sauce)

1076
00:40:10,065 --> 00:40:12,835
- The shell is definitely harder.
- It's very good.

1077
00:40:13,735 --> 00:40:16,544
The shell is harder, but doesn't the meat taste richer?

1078
00:40:16,545 --> 00:40:18,005
- Right.
- It tastes sweeter.

1079
00:40:20,415 --> 00:40:23,515
- It's salty and sweet.
- Right.

1080
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:26,755
(He might even eat the shell.)

1081
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:28,884
(He's eating so well.)

1082
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:30,654
Chef, do you like soy sauce marinated crab?

1083
00:40:30,655 --> 00:40:32,325
Yes, I like it very much.

1084
00:40:33,225 --> 00:40:34,325
(Slurping)

1085
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,724
How does stone crab...

1086
00:40:37,725 --> 00:40:39,995
compare to what you had before? Is it different?

1087
00:40:40,735 --> 00:40:41,735
- A little?
- Yes.

1088
00:40:45,265 --> 00:40:47,375
(Humph! I'm busy too.)

1089
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:49,335
(Crunching)

1090
00:40:51,645 --> 00:40:53,114
(Sucking)

1091
00:40:53,115 --> 00:40:55,515
- It's really delicious.
- It's not fishy.

1092
00:40:56,085 --> 00:40:58,485
- It's not fishy.
- It's not fishy at all.

1093
00:41:01,555 --> 00:41:05,625
(The beautiful stone crab harmony echoes throughout the restaurant.)

1094
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:09,325
(The maestro in this section is Eddie.)

1095
00:41:09,355 --> 00:41:11,035
- It's really delicious.
- It's not fishy.

1096
00:41:11,525 --> 00:41:13,294
Chef, you know how to eat it.

1097
00:41:13,295 --> 00:41:15,015
(Du Jun plays the stone crab like a flute.)

1098
00:41:17,865 --> 00:41:21,635
(A Sung is in charge of the chorus with her delicious humming.)

1099
00:41:22,235 --> 00:41:24,304
(The stone crab ensemble's fantastic concerto...)

1100
00:41:24,305 --> 00:41:26,215
(overpowers the audience.)

1101
00:41:27,215 --> 00:41:29,174
- It's not fishy.
- It's very fresh.

1102
00:41:29,175 --> 00:41:32,515
Yes, it's really fresh.

1103
00:41:33,485 --> 00:41:35,284
- It doesn't smell like crab.
- I agree.

1104
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,855
It's very clean and fresh.

1105
00:41:38,285 --> 00:41:39,595
Like crab jelly.

1106
00:41:41,825 --> 00:41:46,765
This is probably the best marinated crab I've ever eaten.

1107
00:41:46,865 --> 00:41:51,234
The crab was different. It had a sweeter flavor.

1108
00:41:51,235 --> 00:41:53,905
It tasted like a very clean ocean.

1109
00:41:54,335 --> 00:41:57,875
I think that's a very difficult flavor to achieve.

1110
00:41:59,105 --> 00:42:00,614
(Soon, he's muted again.)

1111
00:42:00,615 --> 00:42:01,815
It's so refreshing.

1112
00:42:02,015 --> 00:42:03,085
Isn't it good?

1113
00:42:03,585 --> 00:42:06,684
Chef, this is the shell of the crab.

1114
00:42:06,685 --> 00:42:09,254
- When you mix this with rice, - I know.

1115
00:42:09,255 --> 00:42:10,455
It will taste different.

1116
00:42:11,755 --> 00:42:15,695
(Rice with savory and sticky innards make the best delicacy.)

1117
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:20,035
(It's so good that you won't realize what's happening around you.)

1118
00:42:21,695 --> 00:42:23,834
(The essence of soy sauce marinated crab)

1119
00:42:23,835 --> 00:42:25,465
(Crab shell bibimbap)

1120
00:42:26,835 --> 00:42:28,874
Chef, you're eating so well.

1121
00:42:28,875 --> 00:42:30,575
(Eddie mixes rice in the crab shell.)

1122
00:42:34,175 --> 00:42:36,715
- You should try. This is so good.
- Really? Can I try it?

1123
00:42:36,885 --> 00:42:39,415
Because it tastes different.

1124
00:42:40,155 --> 00:42:42,985
That's because of the innards inside.

1125
00:42:45,785 --> 00:42:48,124
(A Sung tastes a bite first.)

1126
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:50,625
(Deeply moved)

1127
00:42:51,225 --> 00:42:54,535
(Foodie Si A also tries a bite.)

1128
00:42:55,765 --> 00:42:57,065
It's really good.

1129
00:42:57,435 --> 00:42:58,465
It's insane.

1130
00:42:58,705 --> 00:43:00,635
It's very soft and savory.

1131
00:43:01,175 --> 00:43:02,474
The intestines must taste good.

1132
00:43:02,475 --> 00:43:04,174
They taste very good.

1133
00:43:04,175 --> 00:43:06,975
(Soft and savory crab shell bibimbap)

1134
00:43:08,815 --> 00:43:11,015
So this crab...

1135
00:43:11,815 --> 00:43:14,014
- Stone crab.
- Is it all year round?

1136
00:43:14,015 --> 00:43:15,714
Or is it available only in the winter?

1137
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:17,285
Is it seasonal?

1138
00:43:17,585 --> 00:43:19,724
Does he want to know when it's in season?

1139
00:43:19,725 --> 00:43:21,124
When is the stone crab in season?

1140
00:43:21,125 --> 00:43:23,924
- It's available all year round.
- Really?

1141
00:43:23,925 --> 00:43:26,164
Isn't there a season when it tastes the best?

1142
00:43:26,165 --> 00:43:27,994
It tastes good in March and October.

1143
00:43:27,995 --> 00:43:30,265
Now is the time when it tastes good.

1144
00:43:30,435 --> 00:43:32,465
(I see.)

1145
00:43:33,405 --> 00:43:36,304
I need to learn how to make it.

1146
00:43:36,305 --> 00:43:38,005
- The recipe?
- Yes.

1147
00:43:38,345 --> 00:43:39,915
I've never tried to make this.

1148
00:43:40,345 --> 00:43:41,715
(It's delicious.)

1149
00:43:42,145 --> 00:43:44,144
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

1150
00:43:44,145 --> 00:43:48,054
The chef is curious about how you make it.

1151
00:43:48,055 --> 00:43:50,824
For soy sauce marinated crab, you boil soy sauce.

1152
00:43:50,825 --> 00:43:53,924
Onions, ginger, chili seeds, and angelica root.

1153
00:43:53,925 --> 00:43:56,724
We add various ingredients all at once...

1154
00:43:56,725 --> 00:43:59,024
- and boil them for a day.
- Do you also add sugar?

1155
00:43:59,025 --> 00:44:01,364
- Yes, we add sugar.
- A little.

1156
00:44:01,365 --> 00:44:04,135
We add sugar and some starch syrup.

1157
00:44:04,305 --> 00:44:07,604
We also add things like apples and pears.

1158
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:09,135
- Apples and pears?
- Yes.

1159
00:44:09,335 --> 00:44:12,914
We add the crab in the sauce...

1160
00:44:12,915 --> 00:44:14,315
and boil them together.

1161
00:44:14,845 --> 00:44:16,685
(He understood perfectly.)

1162
00:44:16,945 --> 00:44:19,544
For how long did you ferment the crab?

1163
00:44:19,545 --> 00:44:21,514
It's not fermented. It's fresh.

1164
00:44:21,515 --> 00:44:24,324
We boil the crab the day before and cool it down.

1165
00:44:24,325 --> 00:44:26,825
- It can be served the next day.
- I see.

1166
00:44:27,025 --> 00:44:30,525
- You can eat it right away?
- We make it when necessary.

1167
00:44:31,265 --> 00:44:32,764
That's how we keep it fresh.

1168
00:44:32,765 --> 00:44:34,064
It's very delicious.

1169
00:44:34,065 --> 00:44:37,505
The spicy marinated crab is made with spicy chili sauce.

1170
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:39,604
We make it fresh every day.

1171
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:41,275
- We only make small amounts.
- Right.

1172
00:44:41,375 --> 00:44:42,674
It tastes nice and clean.

1173
00:44:42,675 --> 00:44:44,645
It was very fresh.

1174
00:44:44,775 --> 00:44:45,974
The food is very good.

1175
00:44:45,975 --> 00:44:47,544
Shall I try some spicy marinated crab?

1176
00:44:47,545 --> 00:44:49,385
(It's time to taste the spicy marinated crab.)

1177
00:44:49,715 --> 00:44:52,715
(Spicy stone crab seasoned with sweet and sour marinade)

1178
00:44:55,085 --> 00:44:57,355
(Crunching)

1179
00:44:58,485 --> 00:44:59,554
Is it spicy?

1180
00:44:59,555 --> 00:45:01,054
It's not very spicy.

1181
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,655
It's not heavily seasoned either.

1182
00:45:02,925 --> 00:45:04,225
It's very good. It's perfect.

1183
00:45:05,225 --> 00:45:07,064
It looks quite spicy,

1184
00:45:07,065 --> 00:45:08,385
- but...
- It's not spicy at all.

1185
00:45:10,735 --> 00:45:14,635
(As usual, they eat in silence again.)

1186
00:45:21,475 --> 00:45:22,575
This is good.

1187
00:45:24,745 --> 00:45:26,554
(You prefer soy sauce marinated crab, don't you?)

1188
00:45:26,555 --> 00:45:28,285
The spicy marinated crab is so good.

1189
00:45:28,485 --> 00:45:29,925
- Isn't it good?
- Yes.

1190
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:31,655
It's less salty.

1191
00:45:31,885 --> 00:45:34,724
- It's closer to being seasoned.
- I agree.

1192
00:45:34,725 --> 00:45:36,825
It's made with spicy chili sauce.

1193
00:45:37,425 --> 00:45:40,665
It's more special than ordinary spicy marinated crab.

1194
00:45:42,535 --> 00:45:43,735
It's very delicious.

1195
00:45:44,065 --> 00:45:45,235
It's so good.

1196
00:45:46,135 --> 00:45:47,174
The taste of skillful cooking.

1197
00:45:47,175 --> 00:45:49,255
(The secret to its taste is their skillful cooking.)

1198
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:51,605
I like spicy marinated crab more than the other.

1199
00:45:52,705 --> 00:45:55,875
(He's meditating in silence again.)

1200
00:45:58,145 --> 00:46:00,185
Chef, isn't the spicy marinated crab delicious too?

1201
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:04,355
(Responding with an ASMR instead of words)

1202
00:46:06,225 --> 00:46:09,525
I didn't know that spicy marinated crab could be so good.

1203
00:46:09,765 --> 00:46:11,725
The roe is much more savory.

1204
00:46:13,835 --> 00:46:14,965
It's so good.

1205
00:46:17,365 --> 00:46:20,035
Where's your rice?

1206
00:46:20,675 --> 00:46:21,974
Chef, where's your rice?

1207
00:46:21,975 --> 00:46:23,144
I ate it all.

1208
00:46:23,145 --> 00:46:25,645
(What happened here?)

1209
00:46:26,445 --> 00:46:28,845
(His rice bowl was full a few minutes ago.)

1210
00:46:29,945 --> 00:46:31,944
(After a bite of soy sauce marinated crab)

1211
00:46:31,945 --> 00:46:33,355
(It disappeared.)

1212
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:36,154
(After one sip of the broth)

1213
00:46:36,155 --> 00:46:37,855
(It disappeared again.)

1214
00:46:38,355 --> 00:46:39,924
(While eating the stone crab)

1215
00:46:39,925 --> 00:46:41,625
(It was taken away.)

1216
00:46:42,325 --> 00:46:45,265
(All the rice got stolen by the crab shell.)

1217
00:46:47,365 --> 00:46:50,435
(That's how Eddie's rice was stolen.)

1218
00:46:50,505 --> 00:46:51,735
"Rice thief."

1219
00:46:52,635 --> 00:46:53,935
Can I get one more bowl of rice?

1220
00:46:54,005 --> 00:46:55,535
- One more?
- Yes.

1221
00:46:55,605 --> 00:46:57,544
Please give us one more bowl of rice.

1222
00:46:57,545 --> 00:47:00,415
Chef, you should live in Korea. You eat so well.

1223
00:47:02,375 --> 00:47:03,584
He loves Korean food.

1224
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:04,984
You look the happiest.

1225
00:47:04,985 --> 00:47:07,355
(I'm really happy.)

1226
00:47:07,855 --> 00:47:09,355
Can you take this home?

1227
00:47:09,955 --> 00:47:11,324
- Sure.
- Then make...

1228
00:47:11,325 --> 00:47:15,354
You know, take this and make marinated crab with it at home?

1229
00:47:15,355 --> 00:47:17,924
No, it's been boiled once.

1230
00:47:17,925 --> 00:47:19,794
- That's it?
- You can't use sterilized crab.

1231
00:47:19,795 --> 00:47:21,335
- You can't make it?
- No.

1232
00:47:23,635 --> 00:47:27,205
What do you do when you crave marinated crab in the US?

1233
00:47:27,305 --> 00:47:28,335
I just resist it.

1234
00:47:29,005 --> 00:47:30,645
But you eat it so well.

1235
00:47:31,005 --> 00:47:32,905
- You like it so much.
- You like it.

1236
00:47:33,005 --> 00:47:36,445
I only eat things like this in Korea.

1237
00:47:36,915 --> 00:47:37,985
It doesn't taste as good?

1238
00:47:38,345 --> 00:47:42,285
Because I don't want to eat it in the US and have a bad version.

1239
00:47:43,015 --> 00:47:44,825
(That's understandable.)

1240
00:47:45,185 --> 00:47:47,194
- Ma'am...
- What would you like?

1241
00:47:47,195 --> 00:47:49,655
Can we get one more order of soy sauce marinated crab?

1242
00:47:50,065 --> 00:47:51,694
Would you like more soy sauce marinated crab?

1243
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:53,134
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

1244
00:47:53,135 --> 00:47:55,365
- Can you eat more?
- Of course.

1245
00:47:55,665 --> 00:47:57,734
- I haven't started yet.
- Me neither.

1246
00:47:57,735 --> 00:47:58,865
(Definitely possible)

1247
00:47:59,205 --> 00:48:00,904
Here's the bowl of rice.

1248
00:48:00,905 --> 00:48:02,204
- It's for him.
- Okay.

1249
00:48:02,205 --> 00:48:03,774
- Can we get one more?
- Can I get one more?

1250
00:48:03,775 --> 00:48:05,605
- Okay.
- Really?

1251
00:48:05,975 --> 00:48:08,014
I'll bring you one more bowl.

1252
00:48:08,015 --> 00:48:09,745
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

1253
00:48:09,815 --> 00:48:11,514
- Thank you.
- It's marinated crab.

1254
00:48:11,515 --> 00:48:14,455
(Soy sauce marinated crab and rice are refilled.)

1255
00:48:15,085 --> 00:48:16,984
(Are you ready?)

1256
00:48:16,985 --> 00:48:17,985
(Master of eating)

1257
00:48:17,986 --> 00:48:19,355
(Shall we start eating again?)

1258
00:48:19,685 --> 00:48:22,325
(The 2nd eating of soy sauce marinated crab starts.)

1259
00:48:23,165 --> 00:48:26,465
(Their eating instinct is reset like it's their first time.)

1260
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:31,505
(He can't miss the tiniest flesh in the shell!)

1261
00:48:32,165 --> 00:48:33,535
(He sure isn't an easy opponent.)

1262
00:48:34,005 --> 00:48:37,205
(He is eating fiercely without even breathing.)

1263
00:48:38,075 --> 00:48:39,604
(Feeling rushed because of him)

1264
00:48:39,605 --> 00:48:41,415
(A grain of rice)

1265
00:48:42,175 --> 00:48:43,984
(They all eat so well.)

1266
00:48:43,985 --> 00:48:45,684
Just five dollars for a refill? That's so cheap.

1267
00:48:45,685 --> 00:48:46,755
It's very cheap.

1268
00:48:47,115 --> 00:48:48,215
That's impossible.

1269
00:48:48,615 --> 00:48:50,154
If people like us come here to eat,

1270
00:48:50,155 --> 00:48:51,755
they're practically making money.

1271
00:48:54,755 --> 00:48:56,795
- I'll try the braised hairtail.
- Okay.

1272
00:48:57,225 --> 00:49:00,135
(Yeosu's braised hairtail was forgotten over marinated crab.)

1273
00:49:07,135 --> 00:49:09,135
(Covering her mouth in surprise)

1274
00:49:09,945 --> 00:49:12,374
Chef, the braised hairtail is fantastic.

1275
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:13,445
(Okay, I got it.)

1276
00:49:13,675 --> 00:49:15,144
It's so delicious.

1277
00:49:15,145 --> 00:49:17,285
(Another dish that whets your appetite)

1278
00:49:25,825 --> 00:49:27,095
Gosh, this is good too.

1279
00:49:30,965 --> 00:49:33,565
It looks like it's seasoned very strongly.

1280
00:49:33,835 --> 00:49:35,364
- It's not as strong as I thought.
- Just perfect, right?

1281
00:49:35,365 --> 00:49:36,494
Yes, it's great.

1282
00:49:36,495 --> 00:49:38,334
- It's just nice.
- Yes.

1283
00:49:38,335 --> 00:49:40,855
(The soup may be red, but it's the perfect level of spiciness.)

1284
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:43,674
(He picks up his bowl and starts eating braised hairtail.)

1285
00:49:43,675 --> 00:49:45,845
- The soup is so good.
- It is, isn't it?

1286
00:49:46,545 --> 00:49:47,574
Together with rice.

1287
00:49:47,575 --> 00:49:49,815
(For your information, that is his second bowl of rice.)

1288
00:49:53,985 --> 00:49:56,624
It looked so red like it was going to be spicy,

1289
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:58,355
but it really wasn't spicy at all.

1290
00:49:58,555 --> 00:49:59,785
Maybe...

1291
00:50:00,355 --> 00:50:02,155
on the same level as marinated crabs.

1292
00:50:03,095 --> 00:50:04,964
I've never had that soup before.

1293
00:50:04,965 --> 00:50:08,435
It just had a really deep, savory flavor. That was fantastic.

1294
00:50:10,335 --> 00:50:12,865
(He is about to bore his plate.)

1295
00:50:15,375 --> 00:50:17,244
(Eddie eats...)

1296
00:50:17,245 --> 00:50:19,204
(and eats...)

1297
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:22,614
(and eats some more.)

1298
00:50:22,615 --> 00:50:25,185
(He ends up finishing two bowls of rice.)

1299
00:50:25,545 --> 00:50:27,014
I've never seen Eddie...

1300
00:50:27,015 --> 00:50:29,755
- eat so well.
- Yes. I feel so proud and happy.

1301
00:50:29,855 --> 00:50:31,185
You're eating so well.

1302
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:36,124
We finished up a lot more than I thought.

1303
00:50:36,125 --> 00:50:37,925
- Yes.
- I thought we ordered too much.

1304
00:50:40,235 --> 00:50:42,764
(Pouring himself a drink)

1305
00:50:42,765 --> 00:50:44,134
- You have the perfect...
- How cute.

1306
00:50:44,135 --> 00:50:45,255
Korean middle-aged man vibe.

1307
00:50:46,035 --> 00:50:47,674
(He gives off the vibe of a 52-year-old Yeosu man.)

1308
00:50:47,675 --> 00:50:50,175
- He keeps drinking soju.
- This really is his first time.

1309
00:50:53,545 --> 00:50:54,744
I'm Korean,

1310
00:50:54,745 --> 00:50:56,444
so I know how Korean middle-aged men react.

1311
00:50:56,445 --> 00:50:58,315
They don't make sounds like this.

1312
00:50:58,785 --> 00:51:00,115
Their nostrils expand.

1313
00:51:00,455 --> 00:51:02,555
I saw that in Edward today.

1314
00:51:02,785 --> 00:51:05,724
(He's completely become a middle-aged Korean man.)

1315
00:51:05,725 --> 00:51:07,695
I'm not a big soju drinker.

1316
00:51:08,655 --> 00:51:11,065
But if you do spicy marinated crab...

1317
00:51:13,935 --> 00:51:16,135
- and soju...
- It's the best drinking snack.

1318
00:51:16,565 --> 00:51:18,104
- It's perfect.
- Perfect.

1319
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:19,105
Perfect.

1320
00:51:19,465 --> 00:51:20,834
(The Country members and Du Jun ate 2 servings of braised hairtail, )

1321
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:22,104
(6 servings of marinated crabs, 6 bowls of rice, )

1322
00:51:22,105 --> 00:51:23,621
(and 1 bottle of soju finished by Eddie himself.)

1323
00:51:23,645 --> 00:51:24,974
- How was it?
- It was really delicious.

1324
00:51:24,975 --> 00:51:26,075
- Really?
- Yes.

1325
00:51:26,175 --> 00:51:28,075
Marinated crab is enchanting.

1326
00:51:28,315 --> 00:51:30,814
(He's feeling good and high.)

1327
00:51:30,815 --> 00:51:31,915
I need karaoke.

1328
00:51:33,615 --> 00:51:34,715
(Karaoke all of a sudden?)

1329
00:51:36,055 --> 00:51:37,185
Karaoke?

1330
00:51:38,555 --> 00:51:39,685
That was a good meal.

1331
00:51:40,025 --> 00:51:41,095
I'm so full.

1332
00:51:42,525 --> 00:51:43,724
Thank you for the food.

1333
00:51:43,725 --> 00:51:45,094
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1334
00:51:45,095 --> 00:51:46,794
(Thank you, Yeosu's marinated crab!)

1335
00:51:46,795 --> 00:51:48,665
(Specialize in marinated crab meal)

1336
00:51:48,935 --> 00:51:51,364
- That place looks exotic.
- I agree.

1337
00:51:51,365 --> 00:51:52,764
- It feels like Europe.
- Yes.

1338
00:51:52,765 --> 00:51:54,104
- East Europe.
- It goes nicely with the sky.

1339
00:51:54,105 --> 00:51:55,174
(Where did they go?)

1340
00:51:55,175 --> 00:51:56,175
It's pretty.

1341
00:51:56,505 --> 00:51:59,974
This is the famous Yeosu sea.

1342
00:51:59,975 --> 00:52:01,015
Yeosu sea.

1343
00:52:02,375 --> 00:52:05,385
(The city and the sea coexist in Yeosu.)

1344
00:52:06,145 --> 00:52:09,055
(A romantic city with beautiful day and night)

1345
00:52:09,615 --> 00:52:11,324
(Located on one side of the romantic city...)

1346
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:13,125
(are the Turtle Ship and Admiral Yi Sun Sin.)

1347
00:52:14,395 --> 00:52:17,625
(The heart of Yeosu, Yi Sun Sin Square)

1348
00:52:18,525 --> 00:52:20,865
(Locals and tourists visit it nonstop.)

1349
00:52:21,095 --> 00:52:22,935
(It is the center of Yeosu.)

1350
00:52:23,705 --> 00:52:28,135
(It's due to the beautiful desserts that capture their eyes.)

1351
00:52:29,175 --> 00:52:30,574
(What completes a food trip)

1352
00:52:30,575 --> 00:52:33,145
(Various food that makes you salivate)

1353
00:52:33,415 --> 00:52:36,415
(It's a famous dessert place that took over social media.)

1354
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:39,214
(Which dessert will win over...)

1355
00:52:39,215 --> 00:52:41,585
(the Country members and Du Jun's hearts?)

1356
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,124
From what I know, if you turn over there,

1357
00:52:45,125 --> 00:52:47,195
you'll find a place for street food.

1358
00:52:47,295 --> 00:52:48,454
- All right.
- Edward.

1359
00:52:48,455 --> 00:52:50,024
Shall we go try some street food?

1360
00:52:50,025 --> 00:52:52,394
- Sure. I'm always hungry.
- We should get dessert.

1361
00:52:52,395 --> 00:52:53,464
- Okay.
- Then...

1362
00:52:53,465 --> 00:52:57,364
- it's that way, over there.
- I can't believe we're hungry.

1363
00:52:57,365 --> 00:52:59,364
- There?
- Okay. Let's go this way.

1364
00:52:59,365 --> 00:53:00,435
Okay.

1365
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:01,975
Is that him?

1366
00:53:02,935 --> 00:53:05,375
(The "him" Eddie mentioned...)

1367
00:53:05,575 --> 00:53:07,544
It's Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

1368
00:53:07,545 --> 00:53:09,615
- Shall we go see it?
- It's his statue.

1369
00:53:10,345 --> 00:53:12,345
You know Admiral Yi, right?

1370
00:53:13,115 --> 00:53:14,115
A bit.

1371
00:53:14,116 --> 00:53:16,085
His name is Admiral Yi Sun Sin.

1372
00:53:16,255 --> 00:53:18,984
He led a battle with the Turtle Ship to a huge success.

1373
00:53:18,985 --> 00:53:20,665
It was the Battle of Hansan Island, right?

1374
00:53:21,155 --> 00:53:24,494
Chef, remember we went to the Head House...

1375
00:53:24,495 --> 00:53:26,064
- in Andong?
- Yes.

1376
00:53:26,065 --> 00:53:28,734
They were the 15th generation of an ancestor.

1377
00:53:28,735 --> 00:53:31,635
That ancestor and Admiral Yi were friends.

1378
00:53:32,105 --> 00:53:33,505
- Really?
- Who was the ancestor?

1379
00:53:33,575 --> 00:53:34,575
Ryu Seong Ryong.

1380
00:53:34,575 --> 00:53:35,575
- Ryu Seong Ryong?
- Yes.

1381
00:53:35,576 --> 00:53:36,844
- Right, it was him.
- Ryu Seong Ryong.

1382
00:53:36,845 --> 00:53:38,145
- Right.
- He's really famous.

1383
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:41,225
(Yi Sun Sin and Ryu Seong Ryong grew up together since young.)

1384
00:53:42,145 --> 00:53:43,145
(Ryu Seong Ryong)

1385
00:53:43,146 --> 00:53:44,784
(He recommended Admiral Yi to King Seonjo and got him...)

1386
00:53:44,785 --> 00:53:46,761
(appointed as an investigator in the Jeolla provincial government.)

1387
00:53:46,785 --> 00:53:48,884
- We've been to his house.
- Really?

1388
00:53:48,885 --> 00:53:50,324
Ryu Seong Ryong's house.

1389
00:53:50,325 --> 00:53:51,385
- That's amazing.
- Yes.

1390
00:53:52,055 --> 00:53:54,095
(He learns more about Korean history.)

1391
00:53:54,855 --> 00:53:56,864
This must be the cultural street.

1392
00:53:56,865 --> 00:53:58,095
It's a rotary.

1393
00:53:58,495 --> 00:54:00,534
They sell so many delicious food.

1394
00:54:00,535 --> 00:54:02,455
"Modern Yeosu's strawberry glutinous rice cake."

1395
00:54:02,595 --> 00:54:04,465
They even have Admiral Yi burger.

1396
00:54:04,865 --> 00:54:05,935
Admiral Yi burger?

1397
00:54:06,105 --> 00:54:07,804
- "Admiral Yi Burger." - "Admiral Yi Burger."

1398
00:54:07,805 --> 00:54:09,005
"Yi Sun Sin."

1399
00:54:09,635 --> 00:54:11,445
- It looks so new.
- Glutinous rice cake.

1400
00:54:11,545 --> 00:54:13,574
Glutinous rice cake and mugwort ice cream?

1401
00:54:13,575 --> 00:54:14,774
(Foodie Si A is happy to ponder.)

1402
00:54:14,775 --> 00:54:15,775
They sound good.

1403
00:54:15,776 --> 00:54:17,985
Oh, this is mugwort.

1404
00:54:18,215 --> 00:54:19,215
Yes.

1405
00:54:19,745 --> 00:54:21,054
(The word "mugwort" got his attention.)

1406
00:54:21,055 --> 00:54:22,055
Shall we go?

1407
00:54:22,056 --> 00:54:23,085
- Okay.
- Let's go.

1408
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:24,585
I want to try that.

1409
00:54:26,185 --> 00:54:27,924
Mugwort ice cream sounds good.

1410
00:54:27,925 --> 00:54:28,995
Hello.

1411
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:30,594
- Hello.
- Hello.

1412
00:54:30,595 --> 00:54:31,665
Hello.

1413
00:54:31,825 --> 00:54:34,735
(Looking forward to it)

1414
00:54:35,365 --> 00:54:37,834
- It looks delicious.
- It must be delicious.

1415
00:54:37,835 --> 00:54:38,964
(Various desserts catch their eyes.)

1416
00:54:38,965 --> 00:54:40,105
I want to try that.

1417
00:54:40,805 --> 00:54:42,534
Yes, I want to try mugwort ice cream.

1418
00:54:42,535 --> 00:54:43,945
Is this mugwort?

1419
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:45,274
- Mugwort.
- Yes.

1420
00:54:45,275 --> 00:54:46,914
(It's my first time trying mugwort dessert.)

1421
00:54:46,915 --> 00:54:48,075
Hold on.

1422
00:54:48,215 --> 00:54:52,315
Don't you normally use mugwort to make tea?

1423
00:54:52,545 --> 00:54:53,554
- Yes.
- Mugwort tea?

1424
00:54:53,555 --> 00:54:54,555
Mugwort tea.

1425
00:54:54,556 --> 00:54:55,684
- We often make rice cakes too.
- Rice cakes too.

1426
00:54:55,685 --> 00:54:58,054
- And more.
- My restaurant uses it too.

1427
00:54:58,055 --> 00:54:59,324
- We make...
- Mugwort?

1428
00:54:59,325 --> 00:55:00,494
Mugwort kalguksu.

1429
00:55:00,495 --> 00:55:01,495
(Mugwort kalguksu?)

1430
00:55:01,496 --> 00:55:02,654
- That sounds delicious.
- That sounds good.

1431
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,694
That sounds delicious.

1432
00:55:03,695 --> 00:55:06,494
(Eddie's restaurant sells mugwort kalguksu.)

1433
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:09,465
Shall we try them together?

1434
00:55:09,595 --> 00:55:11,534
Can we have one milk ice cream...

1435
00:55:11,535 --> 00:55:13,634
- and one mugwort ice cream?
- Sure.

1436
00:55:13,635 --> 00:55:15,174
- What is this?
- Milk.

1437
00:55:15,175 --> 00:55:16,204
It's just milk.

1438
00:55:16,205 --> 00:55:17,681
(They go basic and try milk-flavored ice cream first.)

1439
00:55:17,705 --> 00:55:19,875
- That's insane.
- That's dark.

1440
00:55:20,175 --> 00:55:21,714
- It looks good.
- It looks good.

1441
00:55:21,715 --> 00:55:24,044
- This and milk ice cream.
- That's a lot.

1442
00:55:24,045 --> 00:55:26,144
- Good thing we just ordered two.
- That's dark.

1443
00:55:26,145 --> 00:55:27,154
(The ice creams contrast completely...)

1444
00:55:27,155 --> 00:55:28,215
(in its color too.)

1445
00:55:28,315 --> 00:55:29,315
Here you go.

1446
00:55:29,316 --> 00:55:30,324
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1447
00:55:30,325 --> 00:55:31,325
- It looks good.
- Let me hold it.

1448
00:55:31,325 --> 00:55:32,325
Okay.

1449
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:35,494
It looks healthy.

1450
00:55:35,495 --> 00:55:36,724
(How does his first mugwort ice cream taste?)

1451
00:55:36,725 --> 00:55:38,025
It looks so good.

1452
00:55:39,795 --> 00:55:40,835
This?

1453
00:55:42,895 --> 00:55:44,055
- Is it good?
- It's so good.

1454
00:55:44,265 --> 00:55:45,805
The mugwort taste is strong.

1455
00:55:46,035 --> 00:55:47,105
It's so delicious.

1456
00:55:47,435 --> 00:55:49,105
I can't stop eating.

1457
00:55:50,345 --> 00:55:52,274
- This is so delicious.
- It's so good.

1458
00:55:52,275 --> 00:55:54,144
(The mugwort ice cream is savory and bitter!)

1459
00:55:54,145 --> 00:55:55,645
- This is really good.
- Is it?

1460
00:55:55,745 --> 00:55:56,874
It's so nice.

1461
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,015
(Foodie Si A approves.)

1462
00:55:59,045 --> 00:56:00,685
- This is very delicious.
- It's so good.

1463
00:56:01,655 --> 00:56:05,255
(A new discovery of cold mugwort!)

1464
00:56:05,785 --> 00:56:07,325
- Do you need a receipt?
- Yes.

1465
00:56:07,595 --> 00:56:08,595
Thank you.

1466
00:56:08,596 --> 00:56:10,564
You get a lottery ticket if you leave a receipt review.

1467
00:56:10,565 --> 00:56:11,594
Really?

1468
00:56:11,595 --> 00:56:12,925
Is it a receipt event?

1469
00:56:13,425 --> 00:56:14,534
- What is it?
- They give you a lottery ticket...

1470
00:56:14,535 --> 00:56:15,634
worth 200,000 dollars, apparently.

1471
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:17,165
We must win that 200,000 dollars.

1472
00:56:17,235 --> 00:56:19,275
Is it 200,000 dollars worth of glutinous rice cake?

1473
00:56:19,335 --> 00:56:21,051
Is it 200,000 dollars worth of glutinous rice cake?

1474
00:56:21,075 --> 00:56:22,775
It's 200,000 dollars cash, right?

1475
00:56:23,005 --> 00:56:25,345
- Not a game currency, right?
- It's not.

1476
00:56:25,675 --> 00:56:27,144
- Do you want this?
- Yes.

1477
00:56:27,145 --> 00:56:28,675
Okay, draw one.

1478
00:56:28,975 --> 00:56:30,114
Please.

1479
00:56:30,115 --> 00:56:31,284
(Very desperate)

1480
00:56:31,285 --> 00:56:33,144
Which do you want? I'll say 200,000 dollars.

1481
00:56:33,145 --> 00:56:34,315
I choose this.

1482
00:56:34,755 --> 00:56:36,915
You can't tell what's in there.

1483
00:56:37,485 --> 00:56:38,485
Please.

1484
00:56:39,925 --> 00:56:41,925
(There's no way she can win 200,000 dollars.)

1485
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:45,095
- Okay.
- Out of six,

1486
00:56:45,425 --> 00:56:47,041
- you need the same three numbers.
- Is it this?

1487
00:56:47,065 --> 00:56:48,194
(She needs 3 out of 6 numbers to match!)

1488
00:56:48,195 --> 00:56:49,595
Scratch it.

1489
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:53,465
(Mugwort ice cream is more precious than 200,000 dollars.)

1490
00:56:55,135 --> 00:56:56,905
I don't think so.

1491
00:56:57,045 --> 00:56:58,045
Goodness.

1492
00:57:00,545 --> 00:57:03,574
(200,000 dollars, 1,000 dollars, 5 dollars, 20 dollars, 1,000 dollars)

1493
00:57:03,575 --> 00:57:05,284
(She has 2 200,000 dollars and 1,000 dollars each?)

1494
00:57:05,285 --> 00:57:08,115
(200,000 dollars, 1,000 dollars, 5 dollars, 20 dollars, 1,000 dollars)

1495
00:57:09,158 --> 00:57:12,288
- Hold on.
- Why?

1496
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:14,058
- So...
- What is it?

1497
00:57:14,158 --> 00:57:16,158
- How many of them need to match?
- Three.

1498
00:57:17,198 --> 00:57:21,068
(If the last one is 200,000 dollars or 1,000 dollars, she wins.)

1499
00:57:22,998 --> 00:57:24,108
- Did you win?
- Just one.

1500
00:57:24,438 --> 00:57:25,508
Two...

1501
00:57:25,708 --> 00:57:26,838
- Did you win?
- Just one.

1502
00:57:27,778 --> 00:57:29,458
- Where are you going?
- What's happening?

1503
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:33,349
- Hold on.
- Why?

1504
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:34,850
- So...
- What is it?

1505
00:57:35,150 --> 00:57:37,120
- How many of them need to match?
- Three.

1506
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:42,130
(If the last one is 200,000 dollars or 1,000 dollars, she wins.)

1507
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:47,670
- Did you win?
- Just one.

1508
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,469
- Where are you going?
- What's happening?

1509
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:53,970
(A Sung, where are you going?)

1510
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:57,069
- Wait.
- Are you for real?

1511
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:58,080
Come back.

1512
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,309
(Show us the result quickly.)

1513
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:04,349
- Show us.
- I didn't win.

1514
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:05,579
You didn't? But...

1515
00:58:05,580 --> 00:58:07,119
(Eddie is disappointed.)

1516
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:08,440
- But they were the same.
- Si A.

1517
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,490
No. I only have two each.

1518
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:13,560
(The last one turns out to be 5 dollars, so she doesn't win!)

1519
00:58:15,060 --> 00:58:17,059
That was so close. I usually have good luck.

1520
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,259
- It's a pity.
- Ma'am.

1521
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:19,559
I'll give you one more chance.

1522
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:20,929
- One more?
- Si A, try.

1523
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:22,729
- Chef, you try.
- Si A, go ahead. Chef, go on.

1524
00:58:22,730 --> 00:58:24,299
Okay, I'll try.

1525
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:25,839
(Eddie gives it a go.)

1526
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:27,570
I really hope you win.

1527
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:30,910
Okay.

1528
00:58:30,911 --> 00:58:36,010
(Everything lies on Eddie's hands.)

1529
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:38,520
(Curious)

1530
00:58:38,650 --> 00:58:39,819
(Focused)

1531
00:58:39,820 --> 00:58:40,820
You won.

1532
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:42,589
(Did he really win?)

1533
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,820
Ten thousand dollars.

1534
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,190
Didn't he win?

1535
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:48,430
- He won 50 cents.
- He won.

1536
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,459
Fifty cents.

1537
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,599
- Fifty cents?
- You won fifty cents.

1538
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:52,600
Fifty cents.

1539
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:56,570
(Winning 50 cents is still winning!)

1540
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,200
It's 50 cents.

1541
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,740
(Congratulations on winning 50 cents.)

1542
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:02,039
- You won 50 cents.
- I'll take it.

1543
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,369
Or use this...

1544
00:59:03,370 --> 00:59:04,579
to draw another one.

1545
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,756
(Pay 50 cents to draw another one?)

1546
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,279
- No, give me 50 cents.
- You want 50 cents?

1547
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,356
(He knows when to give up.)

1548
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,680
He's smart.

1549
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,780
Really?

1550
00:59:10,781 --> 00:59:12,879
- Congratulations, chef.
- Thank you.

1551
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,319
Isn't that your first lottery winning in Korea?

1552
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:15,919
I love you, 50 cents.

1553
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:18,089
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

1554
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:20,119
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1555
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:21,460
I'm going to keep this forever.

1556
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:24,530
- Edward, shall we go?
- Okay.

1557
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:26,630
What's that?

1558
00:59:26,730 --> 00:59:28,000
This? Goodness.

1559
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,570
There are so many people.

1560
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:31,800
Are they all lined up?

1561
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,940
I think so. It must be a popular place.

1562
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:39,539
This place must be really good.

1563
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:41,080
It's such a long line.

1564
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:44,149
(What's causing the long line is mugwort choco pie...)

1565
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:47,290
(and chestnut glutinous rice cake.)

1566
00:59:49,650 --> 00:59:50,859
(It is Yeosu's representative dessert place, )

1567
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,760
(and lining up is a must!)

1568
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,530
(A bright idea to shorten the waiting time?)

1569
00:59:56,690 --> 00:59:59,829
Two can go and explore, and two can stay back.

1570
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,910
- Then...
- I'll stay here.

1571
01:00:00,970 --> 01:00:02,199
- I'll stay here.
- I'll stay here.

1572
01:00:02,200 --> 01:00:03,200
- Will you?
- Yes.

1573
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:04,840
- Then we'll look around.
- Okay.

1574
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,969
Let's meet again soon.

1575
01:00:07,970 --> 01:00:09,069
- Okay.
- Okay.

1576
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:10,786
(Si A and Du Jun set off to explore other shops.)

1577
01:00:10,810 --> 01:00:14,110
They're popular for their mugwort choco pie.

1578
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,179
Choco pie is originally made with chocolate, right?

1579
01:00:16,180 --> 01:00:17,180
- Yes.
- Right.

1580
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,849
- Since you have a sweet tooth, - I couldn't think of it.

1581
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:20,889
I think you'll like it.

1582
01:00:20,890 --> 01:00:22,066
(It's perfect for Eddie who likes sweet food.)

1583
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:23,649
Choco pie.

1584
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:25,290
(Hurry up and give me mugwort choco pie.)

1585
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:29,330
When was the last time you've been in a line?

1586
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:32,600
Maybe 20 years.

1587
01:00:35,330 --> 01:00:36,569
I don't line up.

1588
01:00:36,570 --> 01:00:39,170
(He lines up for the 1st time in 20 years for mugwort choco pie.)

1589
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,740
(Can we get it by today?)

1590
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,779
- It smells so good.
- Look at the line.

1591
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:47,240
Isn't that a line?

1592
01:00:48,580 --> 01:00:49,710
Are they all lined up?

1593
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:51,720
That's a lot of people too.

1594
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,049
Hello.

1595
01:00:54,050 --> 01:00:55,396
(Going to a snack bar when they came all the way here?)

1596
01:00:55,420 --> 01:00:57,689
- What shall we order?
- What about deep fried galbi?

1597
01:00:57,690 --> 01:01:00,059
Deep fried galbi, tteokbokki, and fish cake as a set?

1598
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:01,060
That sounds good.

1599
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:09,170
(Galbi is good on its own, and now it's deep fried!)

1600
01:01:09,930 --> 01:01:12,700
(Only those who ate it would know how good it is.)

1601
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,240
(Sweet and crispy delicacy, deep fried galbi)

1602
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,979
- It's tteokbokki. It's thin...
- It looks good.

1603
01:01:21,980 --> 01:01:23,009
Like fen hao zi.

1604
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:25,680
It's like noodle tteokbokki.

1605
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,850
It's like fen hao zi.

1606
01:01:28,520 --> 01:01:31,189
(Meanwhile, what about Eddie and A Sung?)

1607
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:33,420
(The line hasn't budged.)

1608
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,989
Gosh, there are too many people.

1609
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:37,999
Yes.

1610
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:40,240
(They only moved 1 step forward in the last 10 minutes!)

1611
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:43,130
What are you getting?

1612
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:45,339
- What are you getting?
- What are you getting?

1613
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:47,770
A baguette burger.

1614
01:01:48,270 --> 01:01:50,509
- Baguette?
- What is a baguette burger?

1615
01:01:50,510 --> 01:01:51,510
I don't know.

1616
01:01:52,740 --> 01:01:53,740
I think so.

1617
01:01:53,741 --> 01:01:55,621
(Baguette burger, why are you to make me wait?)

1618
01:01:55,810 --> 01:01:56,810
(Who am I?)

1619
01:01:56,910 --> 01:01:57,920
(Where am I?)

1620
01:01:58,750 --> 01:02:02,619
How do you say in Korean, "Can I cut in front of you?"

1621
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:04,590
(Can I cut in front of you?)

1622
01:02:06,290 --> 01:02:08,460
"Give me a shorter line." Is that right?

1623
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,459
- It's "saechigi." - Saechigi?

1624
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:11,759
- Saechigi?
- Can I cut the line?

1625
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:13,000
Can I cut the line?

1626
01:02:14,030 --> 01:02:18,470
I'll buy you ice cream, so can I cut the line?

1627
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:21,839
- Excuse me.
- It's not coming out.

1628
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:25,380
I'll give you money, so can I cut the line?

1629
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,480
Of course. Come.

1630
01:02:26,481 --> 01:02:28,409
- Stop.
- He said yes!

1631
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:31,520
- Give me the money.
- You're so embarrassing, Edward.

1632
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:33,880
(I'll pay him before he changes his mind.)

1633
01:02:33,881 --> 01:02:34,890
Okay.

1634
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,849
- You can't do this.
- It's okay.

1635
01:02:36,850 --> 01:02:38,120
He's joking.

1636
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,720
It's the same here or there anyway.

1637
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:44,259
You'd pay to cut the line.

1638
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:45,359
(The line gets shorter as they joke around.)

1639
01:02:45,360 --> 01:02:48,000
We're almost there. Wait a little longer.

1640
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,369
(Lining up is tougher than cooking for him.)

1641
01:02:50,370 --> 01:02:52,399
- Look at the baby.
- The baby.

1642
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:53,499
- All right, shall we?
- Yes.

1643
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,980
("Cooking was the easiest," by Eddie)

1644
01:02:55,540 --> 01:02:56,769
(It's finally our turn!)

1645
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:57,780
Finally.

1646
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:01,750
Wait. My back hurts.

1647
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:09,220
(His soul escapes him.)

1648
01:03:10,690 --> 01:03:11,690
It's tiring.

1649
01:03:13,590 --> 01:03:15,329
- Okay.
- I should hide him.

1650
01:03:15,330 --> 01:03:16,389
It's so embarrassing.

1651
01:03:16,390 --> 01:03:17,960
(Eddie is extra embarrassing today.)

1652
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,360
(They finally get to order after 1 hour of waiting.)

1653
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:24,400
Can we have 1 chestnut flavor and 1 strawberry flavor each?

1654
01:03:24,500 --> 01:03:27,100
And one corn ice cream...

1655
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:29,410
and one mugwort choco pie.

1656
01:03:29,970 --> 01:03:32,739
Are we buying too much? We still have this too.

1657
01:03:32,740 --> 01:03:33,740
(The downside of lining up for too long is that you overbuy.)

1658
01:03:33,741 --> 01:03:35,710
- Thank you. For you.
- Choco pie.

1659
01:03:36,510 --> 01:03:37,719
(The fruit of the long wait!)

1660
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,849
(This is mugwort choco pie.)

1661
01:03:38,850 --> 01:03:40,050
I'm going to take a picture...

1662
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:41,520
for Instagram.

1663
01:03:42,120 --> 01:03:43,589
- Would you like it in a bag?
- Yes, please.

1664
01:03:43,590 --> 01:03:45,160
That's pretty.

1665
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:48,759
It really isn't cold here. Chef.

1666
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:49,829
(The four meet again.)

1667
01:03:49,830 --> 01:03:51,330
We've been waiting here.

1668
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,336
- They're just here.
- Do you want to try this choco pie?

1669
01:03:53,360 --> 01:03:54,930
- It's choco pie.
- Choco pie.

1670
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:57,130
This is the mugwort choco pie.

1671
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,100
I'm ready for an eating show.

1672
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:00,100
(It's finally time for his eating show.)

1673
01:04:00,101 --> 01:04:01,110
An eating show.

1674
01:04:01,810 --> 01:04:02,810
How is it?

1675
01:04:03,540 --> 01:04:04,840
You eat so well.

1676
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:07,580
You're eating it half-and-half style.

1677
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,479
That was brilliant and so different.

1678
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:15,050
Because mugwort, to me, is a bitter, savory flavor.

1679
01:04:15,420 --> 01:04:16,689
It was eye-opening to me.

1680
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:19,020
Now I want to make mugwort dessert.

1681
01:04:20,460 --> 01:04:22,929
- Let's go.
- Okay, let's go.

1682
01:04:22,930 --> 01:04:26,200
(They return with the sweetness of Yeosu.)

1683
01:04:28,070 --> 01:04:30,130
Both my hands are heavy.

1684
01:04:31,140 --> 01:04:32,970
The deep fries smell amazing.

1685
01:04:33,340 --> 01:04:34,340
Deep fried galbi.

1686
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:37,009
Shall we try some while it's warm?

1687
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,039
It smells amazing.

1688
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:39,686
(Du Jun takes out deep fried galbi that they just bought.)

1689
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:43,210
- Edward, it's deep fried galbi.
- Deep fried galbi?

1690
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,479
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1691
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,079
- A Sung, would you like one?
- Yes.

1692
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,296
(I was waiting for you to say that.)

1693
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:50,149
- Thank you.
- Did you get one?

1694
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:51,260
(This is good.)

1695
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:54,390
Take a big one.

1696
01:04:55,490 --> 01:04:57,659
It's hot. How many did you eat?

1697
01:04:57,660 --> 01:04:58,930
(Taking a big bite)

1698
01:05:00,060 --> 01:05:01,070
(Surprised)

1699
01:05:02,330 --> 01:05:03,930
It's so good.

1700
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,239
It's like tangsuyuk...

1701
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,680
- It's like deep fried chicken too.
- and deep fried chicken.

1702
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:11,779
It's so good.

1703
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:13,500
(They drive while eating deep fried galbi.)

1704
01:05:14,580 --> 01:05:16,749
These must be snack carts.

1705
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:18,119
(Colorful snack carts welcome Country Family and Du Jun.)

1706
01:05:18,120 --> 01:05:20,349
It's so pretty here.

1707
01:05:20,350 --> 01:05:22,050
Yeosu is definitely pretty at night.

1708
01:05:22,420 --> 01:05:25,090
You'll get to fully feel Yeosu's atmosphere.

1709
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:26,790
It's pretty.

1710
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:31,560
(The snack cart zone's lights reflect on Yeondeungcheon's water.)

1711
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:33,999
(Gyodong Market Snack Cart Zone)

1712
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,399
(It's a traditional market during the day...)

1713
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:37,760
(and a snack cart street for Yeosu's specialties at night.)

1714
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:41,040
(A very romantic street)

1715
01:05:42,010 --> 01:05:44,639
(What memories will they make in Yeosu's snack cart tonight?)

1716
01:05:44,640 --> 01:05:45,909
What's this smell?

1717
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:48,079
- I think it's shellfish.
- Grilled shellfish.

1718
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,449
- Shellfish.
- It smells so good.

1719
01:05:50,450 --> 01:05:51,649
Come in. Our food is delicious.

1720
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:52,719
- Hello.
- Hello.

1721
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,220
- Come in.
- Check out the menu.

1722
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,690
- Hello.
- Come in.

1723
01:05:57,920 --> 01:05:58,920
(Surprised)

1724
01:05:58,921 --> 01:06:00,419
- Look at that.
- Take a seat anywhere.

1725
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,629
- Sit here.
- Okay.

1726
01:06:02,630 --> 01:06:04,359
- Hold on.
- Hello.

1727
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,880
- There's an octopus too?
- This is...

1728
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:07,970
- Welcome.
- It's moving.

1729
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,200
Yes.

1730
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:10,700
Hagfish?

1731
01:06:10,830 --> 01:06:12,040
Everything is alive.

1732
01:06:13,340 --> 01:06:17,240
(The food paradise that has the entirety of the Yeosu sea)

1733
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:20,109
(Very fresh)

1734
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:21,630
- This...
- Gosh, look at the octopus.

1735
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,309
(Scallop, octopus, common octopus, shrimp, various fish, shellfish, )

1736
01:06:23,310 --> 01:06:25,780
(mussel, sea cucumber, sea squirt, abalone)

1737
01:06:27,050 --> 01:06:28,289
Let's go.

1738
01:06:28,290 --> 01:06:29,549
(Full of the sea fragrance, this is how good Yeosu's cart is.)

1739
01:06:29,550 --> 01:06:31,720
I've never seen anything like this before.

1740
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:34,690
- Here is the menu.
- Thank you.

1741
01:06:35,430 --> 01:06:36,550
That's a long list of menus.

1742
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,729
"Seafood triad."

1743
01:06:39,730 --> 01:06:42,499
- Seafood triad.
- It's right on top.

1744
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:43,700
What's in the seafood triad?

1745
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:47,300
- The triad has pork belly, - The triad. Pork belly.

1746
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:48,800
- common octopus, - Common octopus.

1747
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,140
Abalones, and shrimps.

1748
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:54,850
Shrimps too? That's more than three.

1749
01:06:55,110 --> 01:06:58,780
We just call it a triad. Before, we only had three ingredients.

1750
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,620
Then we started adding stuff.

1751
01:07:00,720 --> 01:07:04,720
If you really count, there are 9 or 10 types.

1752
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:05,920
(All the delicious stuff is in it.)

1753
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:06,920
That's amazing.

1754
01:07:06,921 --> 01:07:08,630
Shall we order seafood triad then?

1755
01:07:08,930 --> 01:07:10,029
Seafood triad and...

1756
01:07:10,030 --> 01:07:11,360
- Seafood triad and...
- Okay.

1757
01:07:11,830 --> 01:07:15,529
There's a very famous fish in Yeosu. It's belted beard grunt.

1758
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:16,699
Yes, this one.

1759
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:19,299
Yes. You can only find this in Yeosu.

1760
01:07:19,300 --> 01:07:21,309
- It looks like sea bream.
- It's cute.

1761
01:07:21,310 --> 01:07:23,440
They served this for Admiral Yi Sun Sin...

1762
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,880
at every meal.

1763
01:07:27,140 --> 01:07:29,109
Its name is belted beard grunt.

1764
01:07:29,110 --> 01:07:32,079
Admiral Yi named the fish too.

1765
01:07:32,080 --> 01:07:33,179
As "gunpyeongseoni."

1766
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:34,789
(The name means Pyeongseoni. They served the fish to Yi Sun Sin.)

1767
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:35,790
Gunpyeongseoni?

1768
01:07:35,791 --> 01:07:38,089
- Gunpyeongseoni?
- Yes, belted beard grunt.

1769
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:41,730
Then can we have three servings of the seafood triad...

1770
01:07:41,830 --> 01:07:44,529
and two grilled belted beard grunt?

1771
01:07:44,530 --> 01:07:45,530
(It'll be good.)

1772
01:07:45,531 --> 01:07:46,900
Shall we get some soju too?

1773
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:48,230
That'd be great.

1774
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,029
- Is there anything else you'd like?
- No, I'm good.

1775
01:07:51,030 --> 01:07:52,870
- Okay.
- Here.

1776
01:07:53,340 --> 01:07:55,310
(Here come the side dishes.)

1777
01:07:56,070 --> 01:07:57,779
(Are these all the side dishes at a snack cart?)

1778
01:07:57,780 --> 01:07:58,910
Pickled garlic?

1779
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:00,340
- Goodness.
- What?

1780
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:02,480
- They're beans.
- I know.

1781
01:08:02,910 --> 01:08:04,350
We'll get full...

1782
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:06,926
- just from the side dishes.
- You order.

1783
01:08:06,950 --> 01:08:11,260
Yeosu's snack cart serves you plentiful of side dishes.

1784
01:08:11,820 --> 01:08:13,500
- Isn't this mustard leaf kimchi?
- It is.

1785
01:08:13,720 --> 01:08:15,229
- Is that mustard leaf kimchi?
- Yes.

1786
01:08:15,230 --> 01:08:16,230
I'll try.

1787
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:17,560
Okay.

1788
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:21,370
Here.

1789
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:24,100
How is mustard leaf kimchi? Is it good?

1790
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:27,700
It's so good. It's different.

1791
01:08:27,910 --> 01:08:31,540
It's like kimchi and seasoned vegetables.

1792
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:34,340
Put together is mustard leaf kimchi.

1793
01:08:34,450 --> 01:08:37,310
It has the bitter taste of seasoned vegetables.

1794
01:08:38,480 --> 01:08:39,820
- What's this?
- That's good.

1795
01:08:41,250 --> 01:08:42,919
- It's dried filefish.
- That's dried filefish, right?

1796
01:08:42,920 --> 01:08:45,120
- I think it's dried monkfish.
- I love dried filefish.

1797
01:08:45,490 --> 01:08:46,819
Dried filefish.

1798
01:08:46,820 --> 01:08:48,930
Sir, is this dried monkfish or dried filefish?

1799
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:50,929
That's dried filefish.

1800
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:53,630
(Munching)

1801
01:08:53,730 --> 01:08:55,800
That's my favorite drinking snack.

1802
01:08:57,500 --> 01:08:59,940
I prefer dried filefish over squid.

1803
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:06,710
(Eddie keeps eating dried filefish.)

1804
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,110
(Eating)

1805
01:09:09,110 --> 01:09:10,110
(Eating)

1806
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:13,520
It's nice.

1807
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,790
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1808
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:18,020
Cheers.

1809
01:09:18,021 --> 01:09:22,560
(The nice atmosphere makes it easier to drink.)

1810
01:09:25,430 --> 01:09:26,430
(The awaited main dish is here.)

1811
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:27,430
Excuse me.

1812
01:09:27,431 --> 01:09:28,951
- There's an octopus too?
- This is...

1813
01:09:29,070 --> 01:09:30,070
(An overwhelming visual of seafood triad)

1814
01:09:30,071 --> 01:09:31,100
Gosh, this...

1815
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:33,970
- Is that butter in the middle?
- Yes, it's butter.

1816
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,539
That's butter.

1817
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:39,280
(Two slices of butter that will add savoriness to the seafood)

1818
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:41,850
- Like a small octopus.
- That's right.

1819
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:48,020
(The hot plate is filled with various seafood.)

1820
01:09:50,290 --> 01:09:53,090
(Just looking at it makes you salivate.)

1821
01:09:53,590 --> 01:09:55,429
That looks spicy.

1822
01:09:55,430 --> 01:09:57,290
I've never seen this before.

1823
01:09:57,730 --> 01:10:00,129
I smell something savory from the side.

1824
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,399
- The butter smells so good.
- The butter.

1825
01:10:02,400 --> 01:10:04,899
As it gets cooked, it will smell better.

1826
01:10:04,900 --> 01:10:06,839
(It is being cooked well while it smells savory.)

1827
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:08,470
It's so hard to wait.

1828
01:10:11,810 --> 01:10:13,180
You can eat now.

1829
01:10:13,440 --> 01:10:14,810
- Can we?
- Yes.

1830
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,249
(Country Family and Du Jun start eating right away.)

1831
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:18,480
(You've waited long.)

1832
01:10:20,150 --> 01:10:22,889
(How does their signature menu, the seafood triad, taste?)

1833
01:10:22,890 --> 01:10:23,890
It's very...

1834
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,860
Kimchi bulgogi?

1835
01:10:30,430 --> 01:10:31,730
It tastes like that.

1836
01:10:31,830 --> 01:10:35,530
It tastes strong because of mustard leaf kimchi.

1837
01:10:36,270 --> 01:10:37,530
The kimchi is really good.

1838
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,339
So good.

1839
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:40,340
(It's perfect for him.)

1840
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:53,150
Don't you think this is a jeon?

1841
01:10:54,020 --> 01:10:55,020
A jeon?

1842
01:10:55,750 --> 01:10:59,020
- You know, like...
- It feels like a jeon?

1843
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,360
Really? Which part of it is?

1844
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:05,260
No, not that kind. What's that?

1845
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,000
- It probably isn't jeon.
- No, not jeon.

1846
01:11:08,330 --> 01:11:09,570
I get the names mixed up.

1847
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:11,699
- Jeongol?
- Jeongol, yes.

1848
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:12,769
(It's jeongol!)

1849
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,269
- Jeongol.
- Thank you.

1850
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,809
- That's a jeongol, no?
- Jeongol.

1851
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:17,670
Right, it's like jeongol.

1852
01:11:18,010 --> 01:11:20,540
It tastes very different from what you'd expect from its look.

1853
01:11:21,410 --> 01:11:24,510
It's a lot more charming and deep.

1854
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:26,620
I don't think...

1855
01:11:26,750 --> 01:11:28,890
they put kimchi in the triad, right?

1856
01:11:29,020 --> 01:11:30,289
It's deep.

1857
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:31,320
(Kimchi?)

1858
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:33,460
Where is kimchi?

1859
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,220
I don't think they put it in.

1860
01:11:35,830 --> 01:11:37,259
(Foodies)

1861
01:11:37,260 --> 01:11:39,199
(Eating)

1862
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,200
(Eating)

1863
01:11:40,930 --> 01:11:42,799
(When Du Jun eats, )

1864
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,000
(Si A eats too.)

1865
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:47,140
(They start speeding up.)

1866
01:11:47,400 --> 01:11:48,470
(Another bite)

1867
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:50,709
(I can't lose.)

1868
01:11:50,710 --> 01:11:51,710
(The mates enjoy the Yeosu food trip in silence.)

1869
01:11:51,711 --> 01:11:53,110
(Me too.)

1870
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,050
You both eat so well.

1871
01:11:55,510 --> 01:11:57,030
- Seriously...
- I got my eyes on you.

1872
01:11:57,610 --> 01:11:58,619
Do they have a delivery service?

1873
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:00,249
I really want to order from them if they do.

1874
01:12:00,250 --> 01:12:01,390
(Si A was my food mate.)

1875
01:12:01,550 --> 01:12:02,550
(I should just drink on my own.)

1876
01:12:02,550 --> 01:12:03,550
(Feeling bitter somehow)

1877
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,460
Who is your drinking mate, Edward?

1878
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,260
- My drinking mate?
- Yes.

1879
01:12:10,090 --> 01:12:11,190
Nowadays, nobody.

1880
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:13,759
You don't have one? Why not?

1881
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:14,770
My dog.

1882
01:12:16,670 --> 01:12:21,470
Now, I don't have time to drink.

1883
01:12:22,570 --> 01:12:25,410
Other chefs too. We have the same schedule.

1884
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,750
Then who is your best friend?

1885
01:12:29,010 --> 01:12:31,210
- My close friend?
- Your best friend.

1886
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,650
My best friend is my wife.

1887
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:36,319
That's the best.

1888
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:40,559
I have a very close friend,

1889
01:12:40,560 --> 01:12:41,930
but we don't meet often nowadays.

1890
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:43,590
Everyone is busy.

1891
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:45,259
- You're both busy.
- That's right.

1892
01:12:45,260 --> 01:12:49,499
Also, when you have a child and family,

1893
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:51,099
- it's just different.
- When you have a wife and a child.

1894
01:12:51,100 --> 01:12:52,540
You don't see your friends anymore.

1895
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:55,170
I talk to them on the phone.

1896
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:58,480
It's not easy to meet up.

1897
01:12:59,480 --> 01:13:02,780
How do you relieve your stress?

1898
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:04,110
- Stress?
- Yes.

1899
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,580
I don't relieve it.

1900
01:13:08,190 --> 01:13:10,590
I just hold it in.

1901
01:13:10,790 --> 01:13:11,990
You hold it in?

1902
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:14,929
- It's okay.
- I feel so sad.

1903
01:13:14,930 --> 01:13:16,030
(The funny yet sad truth)

1904
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:18,060
Si A, do you have any worries?

1905
01:13:18,430 --> 01:13:19,430
Me?

1906
01:13:20,100 --> 01:13:22,170
I have a lot of worries.

1907
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:25,870
Since I started working...

1908
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:29,170
Of course, I'm so new compared to you two,

1909
01:13:29,770 --> 01:13:31,910
and I just filmed one movie.

1910
01:13:32,240 --> 01:13:35,680
But after filming that one,

1911
01:13:35,780 --> 01:13:37,280
I had a long break.

1912
01:13:37,380 --> 01:13:39,480
And without meaning to,

1913
01:13:39,580 --> 01:13:41,379
I had to take a break.

1914
01:13:41,380 --> 01:13:42,449
(After "The Witch: Part 2. The Other One" in 2022)

1915
01:13:42,450 --> 01:13:43,450
(Si A had to take a break without meaning to.)

1916
01:13:43,451 --> 01:13:45,760
"So how could I make good use..."

1917
01:13:45,860 --> 01:13:47,160
"of this break?"

1918
01:13:47,960 --> 01:13:49,660
I pondered a lot about it.

1919
01:13:51,090 --> 01:13:53,599
Thinking about Si A's concern,

1920
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:56,870
I believe you need to live your daily life well to act better.

1921
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,999
Throughout this trip,

1922
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:03,309
we saw a lot of people who cooked food...

1923
01:14:03,310 --> 01:14:04,609
- on the scene.
- That's right.

1924
01:14:04,610 --> 01:14:06,679
That moved me a lot.

1925
01:14:06,680 --> 01:14:10,109
It felt like something filled me up from top to bottom,

1926
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:13,149
and that will help me to act more freely.

1927
01:14:13,150 --> 01:14:16,389
You might have to take a break when you don't want to.

1928
01:14:16,390 --> 01:14:18,360
But that is your chance.

1929
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,459
It's your time to fill yourself up with the world.

1930
01:14:21,460 --> 01:14:22,790
If you think about it that way...

1931
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:24,829
and fill yourself up even more,

1932
01:14:24,830 --> 01:14:28,369
I think you can become a better actor.

1933
01:14:28,370 --> 01:14:29,699
That's so nice.

1934
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,799
(A Sung genuinely comforts Si A, her fellow actress.)

1935
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,100
We get to find out about your life story.

1936
01:14:34,040 --> 01:14:35,560
And this is my first time meeting you.

1937
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,310
What about you?

1938
01:14:38,780 --> 01:14:40,060
Do you have any worries, Du Jun?

1939
01:14:40,110 --> 01:14:41,810
My worries? Well...

1940
01:14:43,650 --> 01:14:47,350
I do have one. I'm getting so close to it.

1941
01:14:48,020 --> 01:14:50,320
I have 3 years left until I become 40.

1942
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:55,660
What should a man feel when he's nearing his 40s?

1943
01:14:56,430 --> 01:14:58,699
- Since you're older than me...
- Me?

1944
01:14:58,700 --> 01:15:00,460
- No, I meant Edward.
- Gosh, I was shocked.

1945
01:15:01,530 --> 01:15:02,530
I'm sorry.

1946
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:05,700
How did you feel when you became 40?

1947
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:07,440
- Forty?
- Forty.

1948
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:09,539
- I forgot.
- You forgot?

1949
01:15:09,540 --> 01:15:10,670
- Now...
- I'm 50.

1950
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:13,210
Then how did you feel when you became 50?

1951
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:17,050
But I don't think about age.

1952
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:19,319
I don't know.

1953
01:15:19,320 --> 01:15:21,919
One thing about Korea is that everyone asks,

1954
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:23,750
"How old are you?"

1955
01:15:24,150 --> 01:15:26,120
I'm not better than you because I'm older.

1956
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:28,690
I just lived longer, that's all.

1957
01:15:28,990 --> 01:15:30,629
I don't think about that.

1958
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:33,660
Because if I think about it too much especially at my age,

1959
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:36,000
I'll feel like I'm old.

1960
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:37,700
So I don't think about it.

1961
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:41,840
Recently, it feels like life goes by so fast.

1962
01:15:42,710 --> 01:15:44,769
There's that too.

1963
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:48,380
Instead of fearing for my uncertain future,

1964
01:15:48,810 --> 01:15:51,110
I think it's more important for me to live each day...

1965
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:55,249
with commitment...

1966
01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:56,250
and joy.

1967
01:15:56,251 --> 01:15:57,996
(They might be able to find an answer to their lives.)

1968
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:01,760
(Yeosu's night makes bitter soju taste sweet.)

1969
01:16:08,470 --> 01:16:10,299
(Belted beard grunts are getting grilled well and crispy...)

1970
01:16:10,300 --> 01:16:12,100
(just like their talk.)

1971
01:16:12,870 --> 01:16:14,039
Here are grilled belted beard grunts.

1972
01:16:14,040 --> 01:16:15,240
Thank you.

1973
01:16:17,270 --> 01:16:20,640
This is belted beard grunt, and it's only available in Yeosu.

1974
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:24,009
No customer has ever said it tasted bad.

1975
01:16:24,010 --> 01:16:25,150
- Really?
- Yes.

1976
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:28,080
(Looking forward to it)

1977
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:33,060
(Chopsticks full of chewy-looking flesh)

1978
01:16:35,160 --> 01:16:38,030
(Eating)

1979
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:39,629
That's good.

1980
01:16:39,630 --> 01:16:40,670
- Is it good?
- How is it?

1981
01:16:40,730 --> 01:16:42,929
- I'm looking forward to it.
- You know how they say...

1982
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,099
don't pay if you don't like the taste?

1983
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,200
Goodness.

1984
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,170
(Satisfied)

1985
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:52,080
(A Sung cools it down and takes a bite.)

1986
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:55,280
(Addicted to humming)

1987
01:16:55,450 --> 01:16:57,580
- It's so good.
- Right?

1988
01:16:57,980 --> 01:17:00,950
- It's a bit like flounder.
- It is.

1989
01:17:01,450 --> 01:17:04,320
- It has more umami than flounder.
- It's tastier.

1990
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:06,819
A flounder tastes bland.

1991
01:17:06,820 --> 01:17:07,920
That's right.

1992
01:17:08,430 --> 01:17:10,530
- There's the roe too.
- That's amazing.

1993
01:17:10,790 --> 01:17:12,160
Edward, there's roe.

1994
01:17:12,260 --> 01:17:13,530
- Do you have one too?
- Okay.

1995
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,500
(Fish roe)

1996
01:17:19,200 --> 01:17:21,099
- It's so soft.
- It's so good.

1997
01:17:21,100 --> 01:17:22,270
It's so savory too.

1998
01:17:22,410 --> 01:17:23,639
The fish roe.

1999
01:17:23,640 --> 01:17:25,740
You can eat the roe and offal of the fish.

2000
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:28,950
Its offal isn't fishy but flavorful.

2001
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:31,720
I didn't know that fish could be this flavorful.

2002
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:33,680
(He is happy.)

2003
01:17:35,590 --> 01:17:36,620
It's really good.

2004
01:17:37,620 --> 01:17:40,960
The flesh was almost tender.

2005
01:17:41,060 --> 01:17:43,730
It had a very soft...

2006
01:17:43,830 --> 01:17:46,360
and almost airy flavor to it.

2007
01:17:46,700 --> 01:17:49,300
The skin was crispy and salty. And it was really good.

2008
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:52,869
- It's good.
- Yes.

2009
01:17:52,870 --> 01:17:54,940
(Foodie Si A is playing up to her name.)

2010
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,186
The belted beard grunt is so good.

2011
01:17:57,210 --> 01:17:59,610
I really want to grow Si A.

2012
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:02,450
It will cost you a lot. Is it okay?

2013
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:04,179
It'll cost you a lot.

2014
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,820
- I'll try hard to make money.
- Okay.

2015
01:18:08,150 --> 01:18:09,620
- By the way, Chef.
- Yes.

2016
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:12,390
Since when did you dream of being a chef?

2017
01:18:13,460 --> 01:18:14,580
- I want to know too.
- Yes.

2018
01:18:16,830 --> 01:18:18,110
Maybe since I was ten years old?

2019
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:20,630
- Since you were young.
- I always knew.

2020
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:23,600
(But you didn't majored in cooking.)

2021
01:18:23,700 --> 01:18:25,669
But I heard you majored in English literature.

2022
01:18:25,670 --> 01:18:26,739
How did you know?

2023
01:18:26,740 --> 01:18:27,899
- Really?
- Of course, I knew it.

2024
01:18:27,900 --> 01:18:28,969
- I'm such a fan.
- Are you a fan of mine?

2025
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:29,970
I'm a big fan.

2026
01:18:30,210 --> 01:18:31,309
I didn't know that.

2027
01:18:31,310 --> 01:18:32,350
(I almost had goosebumps.)

2028
01:18:32,410 --> 01:18:34,410
(It's because I like you.)

2029
01:18:34,680 --> 01:18:39,220
It was because my parents told me to go to college.

2030
01:18:39,720 --> 01:18:41,080
- You had to.
- They were strict.

2031
01:18:41,180 --> 01:18:43,419
I didn't want to go to college. I wanted to go to this...

2032
01:18:43,420 --> 01:18:45,360
"No, you have to go to college." So, I said,

2033
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,659
"Okay." I'm sorry.

2034
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:48,690
It's all right.

2035
01:18:49,760 --> 01:18:52,699
I said, "I'm just going to read books."

2036
01:18:52,700 --> 01:18:55,630
I knew after college I was going to be a chef.

2037
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,599
I just said it because I liked to read books.

2038
01:18:58,600 --> 01:19:01,439
That I'm just going to be a literature major.

2039
01:19:01,440 --> 01:19:02,440
- I have a question.
- Okay.

2040
01:19:02,441 --> 01:19:03,641
Did you get good grades, then?

2041
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:07,610
Yes. I did okay.

2042
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,449
Your parents were like the typical Korean parents.

2043
01:19:10,450 --> 01:19:12,719
"If you want to do what you want, go to college first."

2044
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

2045
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:15,989
"It's not too late when you do it after college."

2046
01:19:15,990 --> 01:19:17,589
- That's right.
- For his generation,

2047
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:19,460
- it might have been tougher.
- That's right.

2048
01:19:19,920 --> 01:19:20,920
Seriously.

2049
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:23,389
Where was your first restaurant?

2050
01:19:23,390 --> 01:19:25,430
Manhattan, New York City. Yes.

2051
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:27,330
I was 25 years old.

2052
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:28,630
(That young?)

2053
01:19:28,630 --> 01:19:29,630
If you were 25 years old...

2054
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:32,139
How did you get the money to open the restaurant?

2055
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,300
It's a secret.

2056
01:19:35,440 --> 01:19:36,440
We got it.

2057
01:19:37,370 --> 01:19:38,370
It's a secret.

2058
01:19:38,371 --> 01:19:40,840
No. I borrowed a lot of money.

2059
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:45,620
But it was very scary because you borrowed money.

2060
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:48,350
When you borrow money, you have to take the responsibility.

2061
01:19:48,650 --> 01:19:49,820
Was the restaurant a success?

2062
01:19:50,450 --> 01:19:53,520
It was. It's a long story. So we did it.

2063
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:54,660
For two years,

2064
01:19:56,130 --> 01:19:58,029
we didn't take a break. We opened every day.

2065
01:19:58,030 --> 01:19:59,759
- You didn't have a single day off?
- No.

2066
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:01,440
That means there were that many customers.

2067
01:20:01,900 --> 01:20:04,270
So I paid all of the money back.

2068
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,599
- Did you pay it back in two years?
- Yes.

2069
01:20:06,600 --> 01:20:07,700
That's crazy.

2070
01:20:08,200 --> 01:20:11,839
But the 9-11 happened in Manhattan.

2071
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,139
- Yes.
- Yes. We know it.

2072
01:20:13,140 --> 01:20:14,539
So, the 9-11 happened.

2073
01:20:14,540 --> 01:20:16,249
The terrorists' attack happened in Manhattan on September 11.

2074
01:20:16,250 --> 01:20:17,910
So my restaurant tanked.

2075
01:20:18,010 --> 01:20:19,126
- Did it go out of business?
- Yes.

2076
01:20:19,150 --> 01:20:21,179
After I paid all the money,

2077
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:22,619
- I was...
- It went out of business.

2078
01:20:22,620 --> 01:20:23,620
For goodness' sake.

2079
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:28,660
(The 9-11 terrorists' attack shocked the world world.)

2080
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:33,460
(Everything in New York stopped due to the catastrophe.)

2081
01:20:38,130 --> 01:20:40,400
That was a hard time.

2082
01:20:40,870 --> 01:20:44,969
At the same time, people lost... So many people died.

2083
01:20:44,970 --> 01:20:47,210
- Yes.
- Even though I lost my business,

2084
01:20:47,840 --> 01:20:50,109
I didn't lose my life. I didn't lose...

2085
01:20:50,110 --> 01:20:52,349
I didn't lose my brother or my sister.

2086
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:55,449
So it was like, "How can I complain?"

2087
01:20:55,450 --> 01:20:57,620
So, that was just...

2088
01:20:58,890 --> 01:21:01,859
So I had to pick up and start all over again.

2089
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:03,580
- He started all over again.
- And went on.

2090
01:21:04,190 --> 01:21:07,130
(Eddie didn't give up while he faced hard times.)

2091
01:21:07,330 --> 01:21:09,800
(In the end, his endless tries and efforts...)

2092
01:21:10,830 --> 01:21:14,970
(paid off.)

2093
01:21:16,410 --> 01:21:18,339
("Once you start something, you have to go all the way.")

2094
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:19,379
("Let's do it.")

2095
01:21:19,380 --> 01:21:21,380
(Edward Lee from "Culinary Class Wars")

2096
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:23,910
- It was just sad.
- It was a little...

2097
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:26,180
In your life as a chef,

2098
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:29,089
is there a person you are most influenced by?

2099
01:21:29,090 --> 01:21:30,650
It can be another chef.

2100
01:21:31,090 --> 01:21:34,520
Actually, for every chef I meet,

2101
01:21:35,830 --> 01:21:38,600
I try to learn something from them.

2102
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:40,060
There isn't one special person.

2103
01:21:40,360 --> 01:21:42,870
Because in America back then,

2104
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,669
there were not a lot of Asian chefs that were famous.

2105
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:47,739
- Right?
- That's right.

2106
01:21:47,740 --> 01:21:49,870
I didn't have a role model, and...

2107
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:53,810
I think everybody has influenced me.

2108
01:21:54,140 --> 01:21:56,950
My grandmother taught me about food.

2109
01:21:57,450 --> 01:22:00,380
My mother and father taught me about hard work.

2110
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:03,920
My teachers taught me to be smart.

2111
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:06,760
Even I learn from you guys.

2112
01:22:06,860 --> 01:22:09,029
- You know?
- No way.

2113
01:22:09,030 --> 01:22:10,190
It might not be about food...

2114
01:22:10,860 --> 01:22:13,059
- but about life and other things.
- Gosh.

2115
01:22:13,060 --> 01:22:14,860
- About Korea and about culture.
- Yes.

2116
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:18,800
So I try to learn from everybody a little bit of something.

2117
01:22:22,110 --> 01:22:23,910
- It makes me reflect on myself.
- It's so...

2118
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:27,780
I'm the only drunk one talking.

2119
01:22:28,110 --> 01:22:30,450
Gosh. I'm drunk too. Pour me one.

2120
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:32,249
Pour me one. I'm drunk.

2121
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,120
- No.
- Pour me a glass.

2122
01:22:34,680 --> 01:22:35,919
(He pours for her.)

2123
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,320
Thank you.

2124
01:22:37,620 --> 01:22:38,819
Thank you.

2125
01:22:38,820 --> 01:22:41,690
(They have their last shots of the late night.)

2126
01:22:42,860 --> 01:22:43,990
All right. Let's go to bed.

2127
01:22:44,090 --> 01:22:45,090
- Okay.
- Yes.

2128
01:22:47,630 --> 01:22:49,199
Should we meet after getting changed?

2129
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:50,200
- Okay.
- Yes.

2130
01:22:50,430 --> 01:22:52,099
Is it real? Is Chef...

2131
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,580
- He's having a tough time.
- Really?

2132
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,810
(What happened to Eddie?)

2133
01:22:57,040 --> 01:22:58,840
Chef Lee has a stomachache.

2134
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:02,480
He ate too much.

2135
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:03,780
(Laughing)

2136
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:04,850
My stomach hurts too.

2137
01:23:05,180 --> 01:23:06,879
We ate too much.

2138
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,090
It's not an upset stomach but overeating.

2139
01:23:10,690 --> 01:23:11,849
(What he had today)

2140
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:13,819
(Tofu, marinated crab, braised hairtail, )

2141
01:23:13,820 --> 01:23:16,129
(two bowls of rice, mugwort ice cream, )

2142
01:23:16,130 --> 01:23:18,189
(mugwort choco pie, deep fried galbi, seafood triad, )

2143
01:23:18,190 --> 01:23:20,230
(and grilled belted beard grunt.)

2144
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:22,800
(A total of 13 food items)

2145
01:23:23,730 --> 01:23:26,170
(No wonder his stomach hurts.)

2146
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,510
(I can hear Eddie's voice)

2147
01:23:32,610 --> 01:23:34,910
(Has he come in pajamas?)

2148
01:23:35,910 --> 01:23:36,950
Is it okay to watch TV?

2149
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:42,119
(Making himself at home)

2150
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:43,620
Gosh. I don't want to leave.

2151
01:23:45,490 --> 01:23:47,289
(He has gotten used to it in one day.)

2152
01:23:47,290 --> 01:23:49,060
(The class of a veteran variety show star)

2153
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:54,800
I'm sorry.

2154
01:23:55,230 --> 01:23:56,769
- I'm a guest.
- Du Jun.

2155
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,269
I should act like a guest.

2156
01:23:58,270 --> 01:23:59,599
- I'm sorry.
- I thought...

2157
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,646
- you were the owner of this place.
- Sorry about that.

2158
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:03,340
"Have a relaxing time."

2159
01:24:04,910 --> 01:24:07,310
Watch Du Jun on your way out.

2160
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:09,009
Yes? Why?

2161
01:24:09,010 --> 01:24:11,010
He looks like the landlord of this house.

2162
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:12,580
Has he gotten used to us completely?

2163
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:13,580
(Congratulations!)

2164
01:24:13,780 --> 01:24:14,780
What should we do?

2165
01:24:15,450 --> 01:24:17,149
- Should we try the Skewers?
- Should we?

2166
01:24:17,150 --> 01:24:18,150
Should we give it a try?

2167
01:24:18,350 --> 01:24:20,389
We'll have three servings of the skewers, then.

2168
01:24:20,390 --> 01:24:21,919
Let's taste it.

2169
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:22,930
- We'll try it.
- Okay.

2170
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:24,430
It's new.

2171
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:26,260

(Skewer-making board game's rule)

(Make a skewer matching the picture on the order card.)

2179
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:40,509
(Once ready, say, "Enjoy,")

2180
01:24:40,510 --> 01:24:41,809
(and put the skewer on the plate.)

2181
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:44,949
(Placed on the customer's plate)

2182

(The gold card)

2184
01:24:50,450 --> 01:24:53,589
The goal is to make one quickly and precisely.

2185
01:24:53,590 --> 01:24:56,160
Yes. Deliver it quickly and precisely.

2186
01:24:57,060 --> 01:24:59,630
(The game addicts' match to make skewers)

2187
01:25:00,460 --> 01:25:01,660
Get ready.

2188
01:25:02,930 --> 01:25:04,200
- We'll begin.
- Yes.

2189
01:25:04,300 --> 01:25:05,370
- We'll start.
- Okay.

2190
01:25:05,870 --> 01:25:07,099
- Okay.
- Okay.

2191
01:25:07,100 --> 01:25:08,440
Here's an order.

2192
01:25:08,700 --> 01:25:11,139
(It's the gold card from the beginning.)

2193
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:13,779
Here's an order.

2194

(The rule: Be the first one to stand up and say, "Welcome.")

2195
01:25:15,910 --> 01:25:17,610
- Gosh. Welcome.
- Welcome.

2196
01:25:17,710 --> 01:25:19,979
(A Sung and Du Jun stood up almost at the same time.)

2197
01:25:19,980 --> 01:25:21,920
- Gosh. Welcome.
- Welcome.

2198
01:25:24,090 --> 01:25:26,259
(Who is the winner of the first round?)

2199
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,290
But actually...

2200
01:25:27,490 --> 01:25:29,259
You were late. But this is...

2201
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:31,330
- Honestly, I was late.
- Yes.

2202
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:33,599
I stood up a bit faster than you.

2203
01:25:33,600 --> 01:25:35,160
Let's check with the VAR.

2204
01:25:35,260 --> 01:25:36,399
How about this?

2205
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,940
You'll play arm wrestling.

2206
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,439
The winner of it takes it.

2207
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,669
- Arm wrestling?
- Arm wrestling?

2208
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:43,239
(Si A, how would I play arm wrestling against Du Jun?)

2209
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,369
- Hold on. Yes.
- Put it like this.

2210
01:25:45,370 --> 01:25:46,509
Yes. Get ready.

2211
01:25:46,510 --> 01:25:48,110
Put your hand here.

2212
01:25:48,340 --> 01:25:49,349
Do I have to put my hand here?

2213
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:51,149
Yes. You have to hold the opponent's arm.

2214
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:53,879
- Okay. Get ready. Here we go.
- I think I'm going to lose.

2215
01:25:53,880 --> 01:25:55,919
(Du Jun only uses 2 fingers as a handicap.)

2216
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:56,920
Ready. Go.

2217
01:25:56,921 --> 01:25:58,350
(The arm wrestling has begun.)

2218
01:25:58,820 --> 01:26:00,319
- It's a close game.
- Gosh. No.

2219
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:01,680
(How can the match be this tight?)

2220
01:26:04,090 --> 01:26:05,160
I can't flip her arm over.

2221
01:26:06,160 --> 01:26:07,460
Gosh. It's so...

2222
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,030
(Even with the handicap, the match won't come to an end.)

2223
01:26:13,300 --> 01:26:15,369
(About to lose...)

2224
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:18,540
(or not)

2225
01:26:20,540 --> 01:26:23,350
(The desire to win can be cruel.)

2226
01:26:23,850 --> 01:26:27,850
(What is the result of this ruthless match?)

2227
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:30,520
(A Sung wins.)

2228
01:26:31,290 --> 01:26:34,859
(A Sung is the winner anyway.)

2229
01:26:34,860 --> 01:26:35,890
I couldn't do it.

2230
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:39,559
(Shaking)

2231
01:26:39,560 --> 01:26:40,560
Gosh. I'm sorry.

2232
01:26:40,561 --> 01:26:42,159
(A Sung had her win in the end.)

2233
01:26:42,160 --> 01:26:43,640
- Are you all right?
- I'm all right.

2234
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:45,970
Did you see how my fingers bent backward?

2235
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:48,390
- I wanted to win so badly.
- Did you see my fingers?

2236
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:49,939
(I'm sorry.)

2237
01:26:49,940 --> 01:26:52,416
I was the one getting suppressed by the self-defense martial art.

2238
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:53,610
The fingers touched my arm.

2239
01:26:54,580 --> 01:26:55,580
- A Sung.
- Okay.

2240
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:57,409
- Okay.
- Enjoy.

2241
01:26:57,410 --> 01:26:58,679
(The three with a strong desire to win...)

2242
01:26:58,680 --> 01:27:00,879
- Enjoy.
- Gosh. You got to make it?

2243
01:27:00,880 --> 01:27:01,880
- Enjoy.
- Gosh.

2244
01:27:02,050 --> 01:27:03,749
- You did it so quickly.
- She is so fast.

2245
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,290
- She is so fast.
- She is so quick.

- A marine sister.

(Yo Han, I'm here.)

2267
01:27:55,213 --> 01:27:57,223
(The second special guest in Yeosu, Bae Jung Nam)

2268
01:27:57,483 --> 01:27:59,993
(Chef Edward over Yo Han)

2269
01:28:00,293 --> 01:28:02,523
(Secure the spot next to Kyun.)

2270
01:28:02,993 --> 01:28:05,833
(I won't let it happen.)

2271
01:28:05,893 --> 01:28:07,992
(Thanks to the special guest, they get hyped up.)

2272
01:28:07,993 --> 01:28:10,503
("You-roo-koo style?")

2273
01:28:11,163 --> 01:28:13,003
(You-look-good style, you have a good style)

2274
01:28:13,303 --> 01:28:14,579
(Breaking the standard language)

2275
01:28:14,603 --> 01:28:16,573
(Your pronunciation...)

2276
01:28:16,673 --> 01:28:18,703
(Will they get close to each other?)

2277
01:28:19,343 --> 01:28:21,649
(An exceptional menu Yo Han made a special reservation for appears.)

2278
01:28:21,673 --> 01:28:24,543
(The Country members dare themselves boldly to try the skate samhap.)

2279
01:28:25,413 --> 01:28:26,753
(It's strong.)

2280
01:28:26,783 --> 01:28:28,683
(Dizzy)

2281
01:28:28,783 --> 01:28:29,982
(Trying his best to soothe it)

2282
01:28:29,983 --> 01:28:31,623
(Sweet potato, persimmon)

2283
01:28:31,723 --> 01:28:34,852
(Will Eddie, who has mastered Korean food, )

2284
01:28:34,853 --> 01:28:37,993
(fail to eat the fermented skate?)

2285
