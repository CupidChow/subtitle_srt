1
00:00:32,984 --> 00:00:35,384
(The last main ingredient, Dolsan's leaf mustard from Yeosu)

2
00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:38,854
(A perfect meal with leaf mustard dishes)

3
00:00:39,484 --> 00:00:41,230
(Amazed by the leaf mustard dishes he had for the first time)

4
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:42,254
(Can I try one?)

5
00:00:42,524 --> 00:00:45,264
(The finale of Yeosu was made with leaf mustard.)

6
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:47,334
(And...)

7
00:00:48,794 --> 00:00:51,434
(The last meal that will cover the 15-day journey)

8
00:00:52,634 --> 00:00:55,934
(Eddie has been writing a recipe book for the members.)

9
00:00:56,774 --> 00:01:01,314
(Three recipes just for the Country members)

10
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:06,313
(The last dish that will incorporate the journey they had)

11
00:01:06,314 --> 00:01:11,254
(The last dish that will incorporate the journey they had)

12
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:13,483
(Instead of cooking a dish from one separate region...)

13
00:01:13,484 --> 00:01:15,123
(such as Andong, Yeosu, or Gangwon Province, )

14
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:20,364
(he wants to make a dish that brings everything together.)

15
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:25,134
(The Country members' last meal is coming soon!)

16
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:28,274
(Edward Lee's Country Cook)

17
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:30,603
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

18
00:01:30,604 --> 00:01:31,943
- Ma'am, let's go.
- Yes.

19
00:01:31,944 --> 00:01:33,374
Yes. Let's go.

20
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:35,074
Let's get going.

21
00:01:36,844 --> 00:01:39,443
I think you might be stronger...

22
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:40,784
than me, ma'am.

23
00:01:41,014 --> 00:01:42,084
I'm serious.

24
00:01:42,254 --> 00:01:44,484
I hear what you do on a day.

25
00:01:45,154 --> 00:01:47,524
Where are the slides that I was wearing?

26
00:01:47,624 --> 00:01:48,993
- Your slides?
- Yes.

27
00:01:48,994 --> 00:01:50,524
I'll find them for you later.

28
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:54,834
It's here. It's written here.

29
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:56,693
- We're here. Ma'am.
- Yegyo...

30
00:01:56,694 --> 00:01:58,163
- Senior Citizen Center.
- It's here, right?

31
00:01:58,164 --> 00:02:00,263
- Senior Citizen Center.
- It's written there, isn't it?

32
00:02:00,264 --> 00:02:02,033
Yegyo Senior Citizen Center.

33
00:02:02,034 --> 00:02:04,514
(It's the senior citizen center for the second cooking class.)

34
00:02:04,604 --> 00:02:05,703
(Who is approaching them happily?)

35
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:07,043
- Let's go.
- Okay.

36
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:09,013
- Hello, ma'am.
- Ma'am.

37
00:02:09,014 --> 00:02:11,283
- You said you had other stuff.
- Where have you been?

38
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:12,744
- Are you back?
- Yes.

39
00:02:13,114 --> 00:02:14,754
- Let's learn cooking together.
- Okay.

40
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:18,723
(The 1st cooking class in Jeongseon, Gangwon Province)

41
00:02:18,724 --> 00:02:20,154
What is that?

42
00:02:20,584 --> 00:02:22,130
(The fierce encounter with the students of the 1st class)

43
00:02:22,154 --> 00:02:24,834
(Jeongseon-native senior citizens who were 72 years old on average)

44
00:02:25,224 --> 00:02:26,623
(They made Western gnocchi...)

45
00:02:26,624 --> 00:02:28,304
(with the potatoes from Gangwon Province.)

46
00:02:28,664 --> 00:02:30,164
(Shyly)

47
00:02:30,264 --> 00:02:31,363
Show me your potato.

48
00:02:31,364 --> 00:02:32,563
(Show... What?)

49
00:02:32,564 --> 00:02:34,380
(There were difficult moments from time to time.)

50
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,104
(Slowly.)

51
00:02:37,944 --> 00:02:39,544
(With the help of the Country members, )

52
00:02:40,244 --> 00:02:43,414
(the first cooking class ended with a success.)

53
00:02:44,314 --> 00:02:47,284
(Despite the language barrier, they communicated through food.)

54
00:02:48,384 --> 00:02:50,253
(It was so easy to make gnocchi.)

55
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,760
(A perfect score review proves how great the class is.)

56
00:02:51,784 --> 00:02:53,283
The chef was going so fast.

57
00:02:53,284 --> 00:02:54,923
(My daughter-in-law keeps asking me to make gnocchi.)

58
00:02:54,924 --> 00:02:57,254
(The students of the 1st class were incredibly satisfied.)

59
00:02:57,724 --> 00:02:59,924
(So, we're back! The 2nd cooking class in Yeosu)

60
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:04,834
(The ingredient for the second class is the leaf mustard from Yeosu.)

61
00:03:05,464 --> 00:03:08,674
(The leaf mustard town's cooking class has opened.)

62
00:03:09,374 --> 00:03:11,103
(Here are the students of the 2nd class.)

63
00:03:11,104 --> 00:03:12,174
Harder.

64
00:03:12,544 --> 00:03:13,574
(Smashing)

65
00:03:13,674 --> 00:03:14,913
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

66
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:16,543
You're so powerful.

67
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:18,490
(Team Si A and Geum Rye, a perfectly synced copying machine)

68
00:03:18,514 --> 00:03:19,913
You add two, right?

69
00:03:19,914 --> 00:03:21,413
- Yes.
- Good.

70
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:22,990
(Team A Sung and Chun Hwa, an infinitely positive pair)

71
00:03:23,014 --> 00:03:25,023
I told you to chop it into small pieces.

72
00:03:25,024 --> 00:03:26,530
(Team Yo Han and Jung Nam, bad students)

73
00:03:26,554 --> 00:03:29,093
What we're going to do with the leaf mustard is...

74
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:30,353
(And the star lecturer, Edward Lee)

75
00:03:30,354 --> 00:03:33,523
shed it with your hands.

76
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:34,533
(Everything is ready.)

77
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:36,334
(The 2nd cooking class will begin right now.)

78
00:03:38,664 --> 00:03:41,233
- Welcome to my cooking class.
- Okay.

79
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:43,404
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

80
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:45,444
- Nice to meet you.
- Teacher.

81
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:50,943
I'll try my best to explain in Korean.

82
00:03:50,944 --> 00:03:54,454
But if I don't speak it that well, I'm sorry.

83
00:03:54,754 --> 00:03:55,783
It's okay, teacher.

84
00:03:55,784 --> 00:03:57,283
Please just follow along.

85
00:03:57,284 --> 00:03:58,554
- Yes.
- Okay.

86
00:03:58,784 --> 00:04:01,754
In English, it's braised leaf mustard.

87
00:04:02,294 --> 00:04:03,524
Simply put,

88
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:06,393
we'll boil the leaf mustard.

89
00:04:06,394 --> 00:04:08,334
(It's braised leaf mustard.)

90
00:04:08,864 --> 00:04:10,904
Ma'am, this is braised...

91
00:04:11,264 --> 00:04:13,034
- Bray?
- Yes. Braised.

92
00:04:13,564 --> 00:04:15,103
- Please try it.
- Bray?

93
00:04:15,104 --> 00:04:17,033
Yes. Leaf mustard.

94
00:04:17,034 --> 00:04:19,474
- Must grill?
- Yes. That's what this is.

95
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:23,114
If you learn it now, you can say that later.

96
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:24,744
- Grace must me.
- Yes.

97
00:04:25,484 --> 00:04:27,184
- Understood?
- Right. Understood.

98
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:28,684
- Understood?
- Yes.

99
00:04:29,014 --> 00:04:30,354
I have no idea.

100
00:04:32,054 --> 00:04:33,453
For today's cooking class,

101
00:04:33,454 --> 00:04:35,553
it'll be bacon braised leaf mustard...

102
00:04:35,554 --> 00:04:37,194
with little mustard and onions.

103
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:39,363
The braised leaf mustard is...

104
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,493
a very old recipe in America.

105
00:04:41,494 --> 00:04:43,263
So, it's not my dish,

106
00:04:43,264 --> 00:04:45,704
but everyone makes it a little bit differently.

107
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,473
(Braised leaf mustard)

108
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:49,633
(Leaf mustard braised with garlic, onions, and others)

109
00:04:49,634 --> 00:04:50,994
(Usually, it's enjoyed with pork.)

110
00:04:52,644 --> 00:04:54,043
(The menu for the second cooking class)

111
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,524
(American style braised leaf mustard)

112
00:04:56,514 --> 00:04:58,143
(Ingredients: Bacon, garlic, onion, mustard, )

113
00:04:58,144 --> 00:04:59,744
(chili powder, vinegar, salt, and water)

114
00:05:00,044 --> 00:05:02,784
(Don't forget about leaf mustard, the main ingredient.)

115
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:06,923
First, grab the bacon.

116
00:05:06,924 --> 00:05:08,754
- Okay.
- Please...

117
00:05:09,654 --> 00:05:12,924
chop it so that it looks like this.

118
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:17,963
About 2cm or 3cm?

119
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:19,164
- Like this?
- Yes.

120
00:05:20,234 --> 00:05:22,233
(Doing her best)

121
00:05:22,234 --> 00:05:23,874
That's right.

122
00:05:24,804 --> 00:05:27,144
(Smiling)

123
00:05:27,814 --> 00:05:29,143
Do I cut it like this first?

124
00:05:29,144 --> 00:05:30,674
- Isn't it right?
- Yes. Good.

125
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:35,114
(Madam Geum Rye does exactly what Eddie told her to do.)

126
00:05:35,414 --> 00:05:36,883
Then... That's right.

127
00:05:36,884 --> 00:05:37,884
(She's a human copying machine.)

128
00:05:37,885 --> 00:05:38,953
Good.

129
00:05:38,954 --> 00:05:40,583
Cut it into eight pieces.

130
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,664
- It's not eight pieces.
- Cut it into a long strip.

131
00:05:42,724 --> 00:05:45,064
(Big pieces)

132
00:05:45,364 --> 00:05:47,023
Not like that. Step back.

133
00:05:47,024 --> 00:05:48,334
This prick.

134
00:05:48,694 --> 00:05:51,304
(The two are having a bumpy start.)

135
00:05:52,004 --> 00:05:53,663
- Into the pan.
- Toss it.

136
00:05:53,664 --> 00:05:54,773
Toss it into the pan.

137
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:55,894
- Okay.
- You can put it in.

138
00:05:56,004 --> 00:05:57,173
Saute it for a while.

139
00:05:57,174 --> 00:05:58,280
(Saute the chopped bacon in the pan.)

140
00:05:58,304 --> 00:06:01,914
Okay. In the meantime, what I'll do...

141
00:06:02,714 --> 00:06:05,644
Let's do the onion. Cut it in half.

142
00:06:06,684 --> 00:06:08,253
(Braised leaf mustard)

143
00:06:08,254 --> 00:06:10,583
(Dice the onion and saute it with the bacon.)

144
00:06:10,584 --> 00:06:12,324
Onions go inside.

145
00:06:12,424 --> 00:06:14,624
- Dice it.
- Let's do it.

146
00:06:15,524 --> 00:06:16,893
Be careful with your hands.

147
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:18,224
You can take your time.

148
00:06:19,594 --> 00:06:22,334
(Madam Chun Hwa takes a peek and prepares the onion too.)

149
00:06:23,994 --> 00:06:25,263
Please add them.

150
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:26,984
(A Sung stirs the bacon, so it won't burn.)

151
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:28,834
(Madam is the best.)

152
00:06:29,634 --> 00:06:31,954
(Yo Han is following the instruction in a relaxed manner.)

153
00:06:32,674 --> 00:06:33,704
Cut the onion in half.

154
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:35,943
Please hurry up.

155
00:06:35,944 --> 00:06:37,614
Hurry up.

156
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:39,414
(I have to hold it in.)

157
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,283
(Cutting it roughly)

158
00:06:42,284 --> 00:06:43,853
Put it into the pan.

159
00:06:43,854 --> 00:06:44,984
(And throwing it in)

160
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:48,723
Please look carefully.

161
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,353
- It's garlic.
- Use three cloves of garlic.

162
00:06:50,354 --> 00:06:52,794
- Use 3 cloves of garlic.
- But place 1 clove...

163
00:06:53,494 --> 00:06:56,364
on the cutting board, and "Ouch!"

164
00:06:57,364 --> 00:06:58,463
Hey. I'll do it.

165
00:06:58,464 --> 00:06:59,464
(I'm an expert when it comes to using power.)

166
00:06:59,465 --> 00:07:01,004
- Please hold it.
- Okay.

167
00:07:01,234 --> 00:07:02,873
(Smashing it in one go)

168
00:07:02,874 --> 00:07:04,004
Let's go.

169
00:07:04,804 --> 00:07:05,944
It's all smashed at once.

170
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:08,844
(How are Si A and Madam Geum Rye doing?)

171
00:07:09,974 --> 00:07:11,783
(She is...)

172
00:07:11,784 --> 00:07:13,313
(just like...)

173
00:07:13,314 --> 00:07:14,554
(Eddie.)

174
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:15,783
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

175
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:17,484
You're so powerful.

176
00:07:18,654 --> 00:07:20,454
(Should I try it too?)

177
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:23,823
(Rolling)

178
00:07:23,824 --> 00:07:25,324
- I can't do it.
- You're good.

179
00:07:25,594 --> 00:07:28,094
(I can't do this.)

180
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:30,363
(Finding an alternative)

181
00:07:30,364 --> 00:07:32,540
(She solves the problem with a technique from her experience.)

182
00:07:32,564 --> 00:07:34,804
(This is the class of the leaf mustard's master)

183
00:07:35,704 --> 00:07:36,904
Mix them together.

184
00:07:39,474 --> 00:07:42,244
(When the ingredients are cooked to golden and smelling good...)

185
00:07:43,374 --> 00:07:45,814
- Saute them.
- The heat is off.

186
00:07:45,914 --> 00:07:47,544
(What?)

187
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:49,184
(Team Jung Nam and Yo Han is shaky.)

188
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:50,714
(Are they all right?)

189
00:07:50,784 --> 00:07:51,854
Medium heat.

190
00:07:53,484 --> 00:07:54,993
- Saute them.
- Mr. Busan.

191
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:56,093
- Yes.
- You're good?

192
00:07:56,094 --> 00:07:57,994
- I'm good.
- Good.

193
00:07:58,064 --> 00:07:59,663
- I'm fine.
- "Mr. Busan."

194
00:07:59,664 --> 00:08:00,723
(That's funny.)

195
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:02,034
- Very good.
- I'm good.

196
00:08:02,694 --> 00:08:04,934
And next.

197
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:07,203
- Leaf mustard.
- Yes.

198
00:08:07,204 --> 00:08:10,673
It's different from how you use it in Korea.

199
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:13,204
In America, as for the leaf part,

200
00:08:14,144 --> 00:08:15,344
- we cut it off.
- Cut it off.

201
00:08:16,174 --> 00:08:17,613
(Separating the leaf from the stem)

202
00:08:17,614 --> 00:08:19,744
See? And for this one...

203
00:08:20,814 --> 00:08:22,553
Like what you did with the onion,

204
00:08:22,554 --> 00:08:24,753
(Chop the stem thinly and saute it.)

205
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,124
cut it really small.

206
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:29,624
(Chopping quickly)

207
00:08:30,294 --> 00:08:31,364
Okay.

208
00:08:31,624 --> 00:08:33,894
(Gosh. He's so fast.)

209
00:08:34,734 --> 00:08:35,863
Just the root?

210
00:08:35,864 --> 00:08:37,063
(Yo Han is totally focused.)

211
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:39,604
Just the root? Just the stem?

212
00:08:40,064 --> 00:08:42,234
(Turning on the chopping booster)

213
00:08:43,134 --> 00:08:44,233
(Madam Geum Rye follows him quietly.)

214
00:08:44,234 --> 00:08:45,844
Nice, ma'am.

215
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:48,913
Please add them to here when you're ready.

216
00:08:48,914 --> 00:08:50,474
(Chopping into small pieces like Eddie)

217
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:52,984
Good.

218
00:08:53,784 --> 00:08:55,753
Please saute them. Okay.

219
00:08:55,754 --> 00:08:57,313
(Saute them well for all ingredients to absorb the leaf mustard's scent.)

220
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:58,383
Let's see.

221
00:08:58,384 --> 00:09:00,054
- Yes.
- Is that all?

222
00:09:00,284 --> 00:09:02,094
I am... Gosh.

223
00:09:02,724 --> 00:09:04,824
- Let's see.
- What's wrong?

224
00:09:05,894 --> 00:09:07,064
The onions are too big.

225
00:09:07,794 --> 00:09:09,033
(The onions are too big.)

226
00:09:09,034 --> 00:09:11,604
I told you to chop it finely.

227
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:13,934
It's okay.

228
00:09:14,264 --> 00:09:16,533
Chef, how about us? Aren't we just perfect?

229
00:09:16,534 --> 00:09:18,403
- Perfect.
- Okay.

230
00:09:18,404 --> 00:09:19,774
He said we were perfect.

231
00:09:20,404 --> 00:09:22,274
(This is nothing.)

232
00:09:22,674 --> 00:09:25,984
(The leaf mustard maestro is now conducting the leaf mustard.)

233
00:09:26,984 --> 00:09:27,984
(I'm the master of the leaf mustard.)

234
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:29,414
That's it.

235
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:34,424
You're unlike others, ma'am.

236
00:09:34,754 --> 00:09:36,693
Okay. Next, we're going to take...

237
00:09:36,694 --> 00:09:37,923
(The next ingredient is...)

238
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:39,763
- mustard.
- Mustard.

239
00:09:39,764 --> 00:09:41,494
- That's mustard.
- Mustard.

240
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:44,434
We call that leaf mustard.

241
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:46,863
- I see.
- "Leaf mustard."

242
00:09:46,864 --> 00:09:49,473
Yes. So we put a little spicy mustard.

243
00:09:49,474 --> 00:09:50,534
Just a little.

244
00:09:51,374 --> 00:09:52,444
Just a little.

245
00:09:53,004 --> 00:09:54,203
- Ready?
- Yes.

246
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:55,404
Put it in there and mix it up.

247
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:58,544
(Mixing them well together)

248
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,443
Yes. Mix it in.

249
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:01,453
Yes.

250
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:02,454
(She's precise, indeed.)

251
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:03,514
I'll mix it in.

252
00:10:04,414 --> 00:10:05,584
You can add a little more...

253
00:10:05,924 --> 00:10:07,953
- Let's add a little more.
- if you like it.

254
00:10:07,954 --> 00:10:09,194
(I'd love that.)

255
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:11,823
Okay.

256
00:10:11,824 --> 00:10:12,993
(Yo Han and Jung Nam add on a whim.)

257
00:10:12,994 --> 00:10:14,063
- Do you like it?
- Yes.

258
00:10:14,064 --> 00:10:15,134
I don't.

259
00:10:15,194 --> 00:10:16,564
Why did you put so much, then?

260
00:10:16,594 --> 00:10:18,333
(Because you like it.)

261
00:10:18,334 --> 00:10:20,704
And add a little bit of the chili powder.

262
00:10:21,004 --> 00:10:22,004
- The chili powder.
- The chili powder.

263
00:10:22,005 --> 00:10:23,033
Just a pinch.

264
00:10:23,034 --> 00:10:24,073
The chili powder.

265
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:25,434
(Chili powder for a Western dish?)

266
00:10:26,444 --> 00:10:28,173
(We're in Korea. Eddie adds the chili powder...)

267
00:10:28,174 --> 00:10:30,044
(as a kick, considering the Koreans' palate.)

268
00:10:31,114 --> 00:10:34,183
(Everyone adds the chili powder, a familiar flavor, like Eddie.)

269
00:10:34,184 --> 00:10:35,384
The chili powder.

270
00:10:37,654 --> 00:10:38,654
The chili powder.

271
00:10:39,284 --> 00:10:40,423
(Yo Han helps Jung Nam well by his side.)

272
00:10:40,424 --> 00:10:42,104
- What is this?
- Here's the chili powder.

273
00:10:42,494 --> 00:10:44,724
- I'll add a little.
- Use your fingers.

274
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:47,934
Stop. Hey, Mr. Busan.

275
00:10:48,834 --> 00:10:50,433
It's good enough.

276
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:52,364
(He's happy after yelling at Jung Nam.)

277
00:10:52,634 --> 00:10:53,863
Now, here's the fun part.

278
00:10:53,864 --> 00:10:55,210
(The highlight of today's cooking)

279
00:10:55,234 --> 00:10:57,534
here's what we're going to do with the leaf mustard.

280
00:10:57,774 --> 00:10:58,774
- Okay. The leaf mustard.
- The leaf mustard.

281
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,904
- Rip it apart with your hands.
- Okay.

282
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:02,373
Rip it apart.

283
00:11:02,374 --> 00:11:03,644
He told us to rip it apart.

284
00:11:04,044 --> 00:11:05,044
There you go.

285
00:11:06,914 --> 00:11:09,213
(The bad cook tears it into big pieces.)

286
00:11:09,214 --> 00:11:10,954
I don't think we're putting that in.

287
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:13,083
- I see.
- We can leave it.

288
00:11:13,084 --> 00:11:14,084
Stir it.

289
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,023
- You should have water.
- Yes.

290
00:11:16,024 --> 00:11:17,744
- You have water. The water...
- The water.

291
00:11:18,624 --> 00:11:20,093
- Pour all of it in.
- All of it.

292
00:11:20,094 --> 00:11:21,193
Pour the whole water in.

293
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:23,634
(Add the water until the ingredients are submerged in water.)

294
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,204
And then, we're going to add...

295
00:11:26,804 --> 00:11:28,304
just a little bit of salt.

296
00:11:28,474 --> 00:11:29,503
- Salt?
- Salt.

297
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:31,643
Please taste it to see if it's seasoned well.

298
00:11:31,644 --> 00:11:33,103
(Seasoning it with salt...)

299
00:11:33,104 --> 00:11:34,573
(is a piece of cake for us.)

300
00:11:34,574 --> 00:11:35,714
Good.

301
00:11:36,974 --> 00:11:37,983
(But for these guys...)

302
00:11:37,984 --> 00:11:39,713
- Should we taste it?
- Taste it.

303
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:40,714
- Do you want to add more?
- Yes. Salt?

304
00:11:40,715 --> 00:11:42,214
- That's too much.
- No, it isn't.

305
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,414
- That's too much.
- No, it isn't.

306
00:11:45,124 --> 00:11:46,824
(He wants to keep adding the salt.)

307
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:48,893
(I have to hold it in.)

308
00:11:48,894 --> 00:11:50,553
Are you guys fighting back there?

309
00:11:50,554 --> 00:11:51,923
Gosh. He keeps...

310
00:11:51,924 --> 00:11:52,993
- You punk.
- I think you are having...

311
00:11:52,994 --> 00:11:54,093
many problems back there.

312
00:11:54,094 --> 00:11:56,394
We have had many issues since the beginning.

313
00:11:56,734 --> 00:11:59,004
It'll be too salty. Taste it, Jung Nam.

314
00:11:59,334 --> 00:12:01,134
Just wait. I'll taste it later.

315
00:12:01,674 --> 00:12:03,804
(While Yo Han is out of his seat, )

316
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:07,104
(Jung Nam tastes it secretly.)

317
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:10,144
It's salty.

318
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,884
What do you think? I think it's seasoned nicely.

319
00:12:14,114 --> 00:12:15,284
Please give it a try.

320
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:16,714
- So?
- It's not bad.

321
00:12:16,784 --> 00:12:17,784
Ours isn't salty.

322
00:12:17,784 --> 00:12:18,784
- No?
- No.

323
00:12:18,785 --> 00:12:21,054
(An elegant tasting time)

324
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:22,753
Should we add more salt?

325
00:12:22,754 --> 00:12:23,754
- Or...
- No. It's good.

326
00:12:23,755 --> 00:12:24,923
- Salty food isn't good.
- It tastes okay, right?

327
00:12:24,924 --> 00:12:26,793
Salty food isn't good for your health.

328
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:28,194
(Salty food isn't good for ladies.)

329
00:12:28,734 --> 00:12:29,734
(Should I give it a try too?)

330
00:12:29,734 --> 00:12:30,734
Yes. I think it's done.

331
00:12:30,735 --> 00:12:32,495
- We don't need to add salt.
- You're right.

332
00:12:32,964 --> 00:12:34,834
(Wait. This tastes like...)

333
00:12:35,104 --> 00:12:36,834
Chef, this is a Korean dish.

334
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:40,544
- No.
- It's a Korean dish.

335
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:42,543
- It's a Western dish.
- It's refreshing.

336
00:12:42,544 --> 00:12:44,450
(He's a Korean chef disguised as a Western food chef.)

337
00:12:44,474 --> 00:12:46,484
- Do you want to try it?
- For some dishes...

338
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:50,683
Some Korean dishes and Western dishes taste similar.

339
00:12:50,684 --> 00:12:52,754
- I see.
- These are similar.

340
00:12:53,024 --> 00:12:54,994
- What?
- This is nice and spicy.

341
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:58,464
I tried a spoonful of it,

342
00:13:00,224 --> 00:13:01,533
and it was a Korean dish.

343
00:13:01,534 --> 00:13:02,633
(This is a Korean dish.)

344
00:13:02,634 --> 00:13:04,463
It was spicy and refreshing.

345
00:13:04,464 --> 00:13:06,364
It had to be a Korean dish.

346
00:13:07,164 --> 00:13:09,133
(Braised leaf mustard recreated...)

347
00:13:09,134 --> 00:13:11,294
(as a spicy and refreshing dish with the chili powder)

348
00:13:11,674 --> 00:13:14,603
After a two-week journey,

349
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:18,583
his palate must have changed into a Korean one.

350
00:13:18,584 --> 00:13:20,114
That was what I thought.

351
00:13:21,384 --> 00:13:24,014
Yes. And boil it.

352
00:13:25,024 --> 00:13:26,453
(Simmer it until the broth is boiled down a little to finish.)

353
00:13:26,454 --> 00:13:28,654
- Okay. Are we all ready?
- Yes.

354
00:13:28,794 --> 00:13:29,824
And then...

355
00:13:30,554 --> 00:13:31,824
Turn off the fire.

356
00:13:33,094 --> 00:13:35,663
I think it's ready to be served.

357
00:13:35,664 --> 00:13:37,294
(Even the bowl is so Korean.)

358
00:13:40,064 --> 00:13:42,834
(Today's dish: Braised leaf mustard)

359
00:13:43,434 --> 00:13:44,673
Okay. Should we try it?

360
00:13:44,674 --> 00:13:46,204
(How will it taste?)

361
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:51,143
(It suits Eddie's palate.)

362
00:13:51,144 --> 00:13:52,344
- Does it taste good?
- Yes.

363
00:13:52,984 --> 00:13:54,444
- Should I try it?
- Yes.

364
00:13:55,414 --> 00:13:56,753
(Leaf mustard, mustard, and chili powder)

365
00:13:56,754 --> 00:13:58,283
(How does the strange combination taste to them?)

366
00:13:58,284 --> 00:14:00,254
Okay. It was your job to assist me.

367
00:14:01,824 --> 00:14:04,424
(He is more nervous than anyone.)

368
00:14:04,924 --> 00:14:06,363
- How is it, ma'am?
- It's good.

369
00:14:06,364 --> 00:14:07,484
- Does it taste good?
- Yes.

370
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,533
That is enough.

371
00:14:09,534 --> 00:14:10,593
Okay.

372
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:11,603
(It's a success here too.)

373
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:12,924
(Madam Chun Hwa keeps eating it.)

374
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:17,004
(Relieved)

375
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,774
(A Sung takes a bite too.)

376
00:14:24,714 --> 00:14:26,514
It's tasty because of the leaf mustard.

377
00:14:27,244 --> 00:14:29,014
The leaf mustard is so tasty.

378
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:30,484
What?

379
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,624
That's important.

380
00:14:33,584 --> 00:14:34,584
(Savoring)

381
00:14:34,585 --> 00:14:36,453
You can try what's inside.

382
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:38,123
Ma'am, isn't it very different?

383
00:14:38,124 --> 00:14:40,393
- That's the leaf mustard.
- I see.

384
00:14:40,394 --> 00:14:42,914
(The unique sauce has absorbed the flavor of the leaf mustard.)

385
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:46,034
The tables in front of us are talking,

386
00:14:46,964 --> 00:14:48,174
but I can't relate to it.

387
00:14:48,274 --> 00:14:49,703
This is a different dish.

388
00:14:49,704 --> 00:14:51,985
(The two men's braised leaf mustard is of another world.)

389
00:14:52,074 --> 00:14:53,104
It's tasty.

390
00:14:53,944 --> 00:14:57,074
(He tried it for the first time blindly.)

391
00:14:59,384 --> 00:15:00,413
Eat it.

392
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:02,353
(He tasted it for the second time while he still can't believe it.)

393
00:15:02,354 --> 00:15:03,453
That's why.

394
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:05,683
Smile. Smile quickly.

395
00:15:05,684 --> 00:15:07,124
(Smile quickly.)

396
00:15:07,684 --> 00:15:09,423
(He can't swallow it easily.)

397
00:15:09,424 --> 00:15:11,664
I partnered up with the wrong one for the cooking class.

398
00:15:13,594 --> 00:15:16,933
(Main chef Jung Nam tries a bite too.)

399
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:18,764
- I don't...
- Give it to me.

400
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:22,474
It's salty.

401
00:15:30,374 --> 00:15:32,584
I realized again that I shouldn't cook.

402
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:36,983
Yo Han wanted to add more mustard.

403
00:15:36,984 --> 00:15:38,324
That was the problem.

404
00:15:38,724 --> 00:15:40,754
I'll cook it for my son if he wants it.

405
00:15:41,124 --> 00:15:42,424
I'll have it too.

406
00:15:43,124 --> 00:15:44,824
I think I can cook it easily from now on.

407
00:15:46,794 --> 00:15:48,063
I want to cook it...

408
00:15:48,064 --> 00:15:50,194
for my son, grandchild, and daughter.

409
00:15:51,434 --> 00:15:53,634
I want to thank him for the fun class.

410
00:15:53,804 --> 00:15:55,134
It was a good session.

411
00:15:56,474 --> 00:15:59,143
Chef, please take some kimchi.

412
00:15:59,144 --> 00:16:00,204
- Me?
- Yes.

413
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:03,114
Please take it and share it with others...

414
00:16:03,314 --> 00:16:05,043
since you can't take it back to the US.

415
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:06,044
- Okay.
- Yes.

416
00:16:06,045 --> 00:16:08,313
Gosh. You can have it back in Kentucky.

417
00:16:08,314 --> 00:16:09,583
- Thank you so much.
- Yes.

418
00:16:09,584 --> 00:16:11,354
- Gosh. That's a precious one.
- Goodness.

419
00:16:11,484 --> 00:16:14,084
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

420
00:16:14,124 --> 00:16:15,554
Thank you, ma'am.

421
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:18,074
That leaf mustard mulkimchi must be tasty.

422
00:16:18,864 --> 00:16:19,894
All right.

423
00:16:23,134 --> 00:16:24,894
It's been a while since we visited the mart.

424
00:16:26,134 --> 00:16:28,374
- Should we grab a cart?
- Sounds good.

425
00:16:28,574 --> 00:16:29,974
We'll grab a cart.

426
00:16:30,774 --> 00:16:31,803
(The Country members and Jung Nam)

427
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:32,843
(have come to the mart before dinner.)

428
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:34,574
- It's crowded.
- Shall we?

429
00:16:35,214 --> 00:16:36,214
It's so cute.

430
00:16:36,215 --> 00:16:37,444
(What is today's dinner menu?)

431
00:16:37,644 --> 00:16:40,944
Maybe tonight, we'll do something very simple but fun.

432
00:16:42,114 --> 00:16:44,314
What are we making for dinner, then?

433
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:46,254
Maybe tteokbokki and gimbap.

434
00:16:47,024 --> 00:16:48,354
- I see.
- Very simple.

435
00:16:48,624 --> 00:16:49,824
- Sounds good.
- Yes.

436
00:16:50,394 --> 00:16:51,394
I love gimbap.

437
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:52,924
- I love them both.
- Yes.

438
00:16:53,094 --> 00:16:55,363
The first thing I do in Korea...

439
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:57,364
is eating tteokbokki.

440
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:01,634
It's the taste that I really love. And it's...

441
00:17:01,734 --> 00:17:04,334
something that I've eaten since I was a little kid.

442
00:17:04,574 --> 00:17:06,374
I want to do something that...

443
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:09,114
everyone can participate in. And it is stress-free.

444
00:17:09,314 --> 00:17:12,644
It's a nice and relaxing way to spend the last night together.

445
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:15,014
Tteokbokki made with garaetteok.

446
00:17:16,684 --> 00:17:18,724
(They start grocery shopping.)

447
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,854
Chef, don't you want a donut?

448
00:17:21,254 --> 00:17:22,354
We should get one.

449
00:17:22,554 --> 00:17:23,653
- Should we?
- Just one?

450
00:17:23,654 --> 00:17:24,964
Let's get one each.

451
00:17:25,424 --> 00:17:26,424
Okay.

452
00:17:26,425 --> 00:17:28,065
- Which one do you want?
- The small one?

453
00:17:28,124 --> 00:17:29,294
- I'll...
- Chewisty?

454
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:30,993
It's really good. It's chewy.

455
00:17:30,994 --> 00:17:32,033
- Okay.
- It's chewy.

456
00:17:32,034 --> 00:17:34,104
Olive Chewisty. Is it olive flavor?

457
00:17:35,604 --> 00:17:37,433
I'll get the red velvet.

458
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:38,904
- Okay.
- That one looks good.

459
00:17:39,204 --> 00:17:41,374
One with the blueberry cream cheese filling.

460
00:17:41,814 --> 00:17:43,644
One Famous Glazed.

461
00:17:44,014 --> 00:17:45,843
One Glazed Red Velvet.

462
00:17:45,844 --> 00:17:47,313
- They must be good.
- They are...

463
00:17:47,314 --> 00:17:48,874
(The cart is abandoned after 1 minute.)

464
00:17:49,884 --> 00:17:51,753
- One cppuccino too.
- We need one for the house. Okay?

465
00:17:51,754 --> 00:17:53,954
- This one. Two of these, please.
- Si A.

466
00:17:54,024 --> 00:17:55,123
- Yes?
- We need one for the house.

467
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:56,223
Good.

468
00:17:56,224 --> 00:17:57,900
(He grabbed the toilet paper in the midst of choosing donuts.)

469
00:17:57,924 --> 00:17:58,924
I don't crave them.

470
00:17:58,925 --> 00:18:00,023
(But extra 6 rolls on the last day might be too much.)

471
00:18:00,024 --> 00:18:01,964
And please add one of these small ones.

472
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:04,034
- A Sung chose this one, right?
- Right.

473
00:18:04,734 --> 00:18:05,903
Here you go.

474
00:18:05,904 --> 00:18:07,003
(Their shopping follows their stream of consciousness.)

475
00:18:07,004 --> 00:18:08,264
I'll grab them.

476
00:18:08,734 --> 00:18:09,874
You can have it.

477
00:18:10,034 --> 00:18:11,674
We should go to the basement.

478
00:18:12,744 --> 00:18:14,303
We have to buy the vegetables for gimbap.

479
00:18:14,304 --> 00:18:15,313
Cucumber.

480
00:18:15,314 --> 00:18:17,413
Do we need cabbage or not?

481
00:18:17,414 --> 00:18:18,443
Cabbage.

482
00:18:18,444 --> 00:18:19,584
One is enough.

483
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:21,783
We have onions, right?

484
00:18:21,784 --> 00:18:23,414
- Just in case.
- Should we grab a few?

485
00:18:23,584 --> 00:18:24,753
(Green onions)

486
00:18:24,754 --> 00:18:26,123
- Tteok made of rice?
- Tteok made of flour.

487
00:18:26,124 --> 00:18:27,623
(Onions)

488
00:18:27,624 --> 00:18:28,894
I don't know how much we need.

489
00:18:28,994 --> 00:18:30,024
Put it in.

490
00:18:30,324 --> 00:18:31,593
(While the cart is getting filled with the ingredients...)

491
00:18:31,594 --> 00:18:32,664
What's that?

492
00:18:33,324 --> 00:18:35,734
(This man is still taking a byway.)

493
00:18:36,634 --> 00:18:38,903
(Super serious)

494
00:18:38,904 --> 00:18:41,064
Fresh ast...

495
00:18:42,804 --> 00:18:44,674
- Perilla leaves.
- Chi...

496
00:18:45,304 --> 00:18:46,473
- What is this one?
- Chwinamul.

497
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:47,474
- Chwinamul.
- Chwinamul.

498
00:18:47,475 --> 00:18:48,613
What is it in English?

499
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:50,913
- It's bitter wild greens.
- I like it.

500
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:52,383
(I'm going to try it because I'm curious.)

501
00:18:52,384 --> 00:18:54,320
- That's perfect for doenjang soup.
- You're getting three packets.

502
00:18:54,344 --> 00:18:56,754
- I'll get just two.
- He really loves a mart.

503
00:18:57,084 --> 00:18:59,284
Isn't tteokbokki good with seafood?

504
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:00,824
Seafood?

505
00:19:00,825 --> 00:19:02,625
- Which seafood do you like?
- For seafood...

506
00:19:03,994 --> 00:19:06,494
(There are many interesting stuff here too.)

507
00:19:07,394 --> 00:19:10,193
(Eddie is stuck with the seafood this time.)

508
00:19:10,194 --> 00:19:11,864
Are you going to add the eel in gimbap?

509
00:19:13,104 --> 00:19:14,603
- What do you think?
- Yes. That will be good.

510
00:19:14,604 --> 00:19:16,324
- I'll get one, then.
- Yes. Let's do that.

511
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:19,603
Kyun's going to add the eel to gimbap.

512
00:19:19,604 --> 00:19:20,903
- Well, actually...
- An eel gimbap?

513
00:19:20,904 --> 00:19:21,913
An eel gimbap.

514
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:23,613
- I've never heard of it.
- Goodness.

515
00:19:23,614 --> 00:19:24,674
I love the idea.

516
00:19:25,744 --> 00:19:28,283
(A gimbap of a different class is coming soon.)

517
00:19:28,284 --> 00:19:30,814
(The collaboration between gimbap and an eel)

518
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:34,224
That will be so luxurious.

519
00:19:35,724 --> 00:19:37,823
Let's get sikhye too.

520
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:38,824
Sikhye?

521
00:19:38,825 --> 00:19:41,164
It's tasty when we add sikhye when making tteokbokki.

522
00:19:41,394 --> 00:19:42,793
- Really?
- It's sikhye tteokbokki.

523
00:19:42,794 --> 00:19:44,074
I've never heard of that before.

524
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:46,064
Without burdock...

525
00:19:46,404 --> 00:19:49,504
We have to add the burdock and crab meat too.

526
00:19:50,374 --> 00:19:51,374
They have to be in gimbap.

527
00:19:51,374 --> 00:19:52,374
(He's struggling to get the Country members back on track.)

528
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,575
The burdock and the crab meat.

529
00:19:54,604 --> 00:19:56,314
Do you sell garaetteok?

530
00:19:56,544 --> 00:19:57,674
- Garaetteok? Yes.
- Yes.

531
00:19:58,174 --> 00:19:59,883
We're going to make tteokbokki.

532
00:19:59,884 --> 00:20:01,644
We have tteok for tteokbokki too.

533
00:20:01,814 --> 00:20:03,453
- Is that mugwort rice cake?
- We have a lot of these.

534
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,153
- Yes. It's mugwort rice cake.
- That's my favorite.

535
00:20:05,154 --> 00:20:09,194
Yes. I'll get 2 garaetteok and 1 of mugwort rice cake.

536
00:20:09,924 --> 00:20:11,123
For tteokbokki?

537
00:20:11,124 --> 00:20:12,793
- Isn't it mugwort rice cake?
- It is.

538
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,314
- We made it in the afternoon.
- Okay.

539
00:20:15,394 --> 00:20:16,463
Are you going to use it for tteokbokki?

540
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:17,464
Does it have a filling inside?

541
00:20:17,465 --> 00:20:18,664
No. This one.

542
00:20:18,764 --> 00:20:20,163
Okay? Should we get it?

543
00:20:20,164 --> 00:20:21,803
Yes. Can we use this for tteokbokki?

544
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:22,804
Yes.

545
00:20:23,174 --> 00:20:26,104
(Eddie is doing everything he wants to do.)

546
00:20:26,304 --> 00:20:27,403
Just a little.

547
00:20:27,404 --> 00:20:29,614
A Sung, I think we got all we need.

548
00:20:29,914 --> 00:20:31,213
Really?

549
00:20:31,214 --> 00:20:32,214
No.

550
00:20:32,215 --> 00:20:34,244
(An important thing is missing.)

551
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:36,254
The dried seaweed.

552
00:20:37,014 --> 00:20:38,654
We should at least get the dried seaweed.

553
00:20:38,754 --> 00:20:40,823
- Don't we need the burdock?
- We do.

554
00:20:40,824 --> 00:20:42,324
- Okay.
- Let's see.

555
00:20:43,524 --> 00:20:46,093
We should go and grab them quickly.

556
00:20:46,094 --> 00:20:47,823
Yes. The dried seaweed and pickled radish.

557
00:20:47,824 --> 00:20:49,640
They're taking so much time. Let's buy them and hurry out.

558
00:20:49,664 --> 00:20:52,104
The dried seaweed. Let's see.

559
00:20:53,604 --> 00:20:54,840
The dried seaweed and pickled radish.

560
00:20:54,864 --> 00:20:56,150
Here's the dried radish for gimbap.

561
00:20:56,174 --> 00:20:57,673
It has 20 sheets inside.

562
00:20:57,674 --> 00:20:59,704
- Should we get two just in case?
- Sure.

563
00:21:00,004 --> 00:21:02,004
Which one is pickled radish for gimbap? It's here.

564
00:21:02,114 --> 00:21:04,513
- How many does it have?
- I think it's enough.

565
00:21:04,514 --> 00:21:05,844
- Is it enough? Okay.
- Yes.

566
00:21:06,144 --> 00:21:08,144
Ma'am, is this the burdock for gimbap?

567
00:21:08,244 --> 00:21:09,553
We can get this. It doesn't have much.

568
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:11,154
We should get a few since it's not much.

569
00:21:11,584 --> 00:21:13,523
(The other three members...)

570
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,524
- It's jokbal, Kyun.
- Do you want to have jokbal?

571
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,024
Jokbal...

572
00:21:17,654 --> 00:21:19,623
- Should we get some jokbal?
- I love it.

573
00:21:19,624 --> 00:21:20,993
- It's so good, right?
- Let's do that.

574
00:21:20,994 --> 00:21:22,964
- The soft one?
- Yes.

575
00:21:23,364 --> 00:21:24,364
(Jokbal)

576
00:21:24,994 --> 00:21:26,103
This one is tasty.

577
00:21:26,104 --> 00:21:28,164
(Adding things that weren't on the list)

578
00:21:28,464 --> 00:21:29,474
(A snack for Si A)

579
00:21:30,104 --> 00:21:32,303
I can have some dumplings. Can I get one?

580
00:21:32,304 --> 00:21:34,343
Yes. I've just grilled them.

581
00:21:34,344 --> 00:21:35,344
- It's hot.
- Okay.

582
00:21:35,474 --> 00:21:36,474
- Are we good?
- Good.

583
00:21:36,874 --> 00:21:38,443
- Did you find it?
- It's so good.

584
00:21:38,444 --> 00:21:40,013
- Now, what is that?
- Do you have one more?

585
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:41,544
- It's dumplings.
- Dumplings.

586
00:21:42,184 --> 00:21:44,554
The strawberry cake looks good, right?

587
00:21:45,114 --> 00:21:47,584
(Korean marts are the best.)

588
00:21:48,384 --> 00:21:49,693
Here is the dried seaweed for gimbap.

589
00:21:49,694 --> 00:21:51,053
The dried seaweed, burdock, and pickled radish for gimbap.

590
00:21:51,054 --> 00:21:52,063
(Jung Nam and A Sung came back with all of the ingredients.)

591
00:21:52,064 --> 00:21:53,563
- Good. Perfect.
- Good.

592
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:55,004
- That's all, right?
- We got a lot.

593
00:21:55,264 --> 00:21:56,264
The cashiers are that way.

594
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:57,534
Si A, how do you say...

595
00:21:57,634 --> 00:22:00,403
- What? Handrolls?
- The smashed cucumber...

596
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:01,433
- in Chinese cuisine.
- The crushed cucumber?

597
00:22:01,434 --> 00:22:02,933
- Yes.
- That's so tasty.

598
00:22:02,934 --> 00:22:04,203
If Kyun doesn't use the cucumber,

599
00:22:04,204 --> 00:22:06,803
- Should we get a mala sauce, then?
- we can smash the cucumber.

600
00:22:06,804 --> 00:22:07,843
- A mala sauce.
- Sounds good.

601
00:22:07,844 --> 00:22:09,674
Wait. There's the mala sauce.

602
00:22:11,114 --> 00:22:12,143
(They're leaving the path again.)

603
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:13,860
- Let's make it in a Chinese style.
- The mala sauce is...

604
00:22:13,884 --> 00:22:15,414
Yo Han, we can use this mala sauce.

605
00:22:15,654 --> 00:22:18,053
- We can add vinegar to make it.
- This isn't the right one.

606
00:22:18,054 --> 00:22:20,384
- This is chili oil.
- Is it...

607
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,153
Do you have caramel Pringles in America?

608
00:22:23,154 --> 00:22:24,554
(Eddie suddenly wants some snacks.)

609
00:22:25,424 --> 00:22:28,464
(Guys, don't tell me you've forgotten about me.)

610
00:22:30,394 --> 00:22:31,463
It's like my baby.

611
00:22:31,464 --> 00:22:33,264
(In the end, he got a corn snack.)

612
00:22:35,704 --> 00:22:36,704
Hurry.

613
00:22:36,705 --> 00:22:38,003
(He's on his own way.)

614
00:22:38,004 --> 00:22:39,004
Why aren't they coming?

615
00:22:40,074 --> 00:22:41,644
I'll put them in the plastic bag.

616
00:22:42,244 --> 00:22:43,644
Do you want a standard garbage bag?

617
00:22:47,114 --> 00:22:48,614
Gosh. We got a lot.

618
00:22:52,724 --> 00:22:56,724
(Charging ceaselessly)

619
00:22:59,664 --> 00:23:00,664
What?

620
00:23:00,665 --> 00:23:01,945
(It's already over 200 dollars.)

621
00:23:02,034 --> 00:23:04,114
We bought the ingredients for gimbap and tteokbokki.

622
00:23:04,334 --> 00:23:06,774
Does this make sense when we're making gimbap and tteokbokki?

623
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:09,234
What are these?

624
00:23:09,504 --> 00:23:11,634
(Playing innocent)

625
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,474
- What is this now?
- Put the vegetables together.

626
00:23:14,844 --> 00:23:17,274
(Playing innocent too)

627
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,443
- We need a receipt.
- Okay. Thank you.

628
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:21,543
- Thank you.
- Have a good one.

629
00:23:21,544 --> 00:23:22,553
- Yes.
- How much was it?

630
00:23:22,554 --> 00:23:23,614
Bye.

631
00:23:23,884 --> 00:23:25,053
- Was it a lot?
- It was around 200 dollars.

632
00:23:25,054 --> 00:23:26,054
Okay.

633
00:23:26,055 --> 00:23:28,160
(The grocery shopping that made Jung Nam dizzy is over.)

634
00:23:28,184 --> 00:23:29,293
Yo Han, are you driving?

635
00:23:29,294 --> 00:23:30,294
(The last driver of the day...)

636
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,493
I'll drive when I'm a bad driver.

637
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,923
(is Yo Han, the worst driver of Country Cook.)

638
00:23:32,924 --> 00:23:33,924
We'll get going.

639
00:23:33,925 --> 00:23:36,364
(We'll go back to the lodging now.)

640
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:39,764
Gosh. I've never seen anyone eating jokbal in a car.

641
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:42,534
Okay. It's my first bossam.

642
00:23:43,474 --> 00:23:45,543
- It's jokbal.
- Right. It's jokbal.

643
00:23:45,544 --> 00:23:46,544
Is it tasty?

644
00:23:46,604 --> 00:23:48,003
I think you like jokbal, Kyun.

645
00:23:48,004 --> 00:23:49,544
(Anyway, it's good.)

646
00:23:49,774 --> 00:23:52,784
Ever since you've come to Yeosu, you have a big appetite, Chef.

647
00:23:53,144 --> 00:23:54,144
(Do you want some?)

648
00:23:54,145 --> 00:23:55,854
No, I'm fine. Go ahead.

649
00:23:56,414 --> 00:23:57,414
Sure.

650
00:23:57,784 --> 00:23:58,824
So good.

651
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:01,023
- Is it tasty?
- Yes.

652
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,053
(Si A gets 1 piece of jokbal too.)

653
00:24:02,054 --> 00:24:03,054
Pretty good.

654
00:24:04,024 --> 00:24:05,463
You all eat very well.

655
00:24:05,464 --> 00:24:08,664
(Jokbal is the best when you hit the road, right?)

656
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:11,064
(Glancing)

657
00:24:13,134 --> 00:24:15,004
- What?
- Can I have the donut?

658
00:24:15,734 --> 00:24:16,734
Donut?

659
00:24:18,474 --> 00:24:19,474
Okay.

660
00:24:20,004 --> 00:24:22,414
Even the donuts, you have to eat fresh.

661
00:24:23,014 --> 00:24:24,113
Is that so?

662
00:24:24,114 --> 00:24:26,114
To me, donuts and fish are the same.

663
00:24:27,444 --> 00:24:28,513
- I see.
- You have to eat it right away.

664
00:24:28,514 --> 00:24:30,754
This is fresh out of the water. These donuts.

665
00:24:33,354 --> 00:24:36,293
- The food is...
- It's alive.

666
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:38,254
You're feeling the breath of the donuts, Kyun.

667
00:24:38,554 --> 00:24:40,323
- It's moving.
- Is it jumping?

668
00:24:40,324 --> 00:24:41,694
(The donut is alive and jumping.)

669
00:24:42,334 --> 00:24:44,864
(He takes a bite of the fresh donut.)

670
00:24:47,004 --> 00:24:48,063
- Do you want a bite?
- Thank you.

671
00:24:48,064 --> 00:24:50,024
(He wants to let Yo Han taste the freshness too.)

672
00:24:50,134 --> 00:24:51,804
- Pretty good, right?
- It's tasty.

673
00:24:52,644 --> 00:24:54,644
- Kyun, the donut is still alive.
- Yes.

674
00:24:55,004 --> 00:24:57,074
(I told you so, right?)

675
00:24:57,244 --> 00:24:58,543
Gosh. Kyun, you eat very well.

676
00:24:58,544 --> 00:25:00,260
(Jung Nam is mesmerized by the Country members' eating show.)

677
00:25:00,284 --> 00:25:01,284
(Taking a bite)

678
00:25:01,285 --> 00:25:02,814
(He joins them before he knows it.)

679
00:25:03,484 --> 00:25:05,923
(While enjoying the snack time, they're back at the lodging.)

680
00:25:05,924 --> 00:25:07,684
- Good job.
- Well done.

681
00:25:08,424 --> 00:25:10,224
- The sun is setting that way.
- It's pretty.

682
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,563
- It's pink.
- Everyone.

683
00:25:12,564 --> 00:25:13,723
(The sunset welcomes the members who are back from work.)

684
00:25:13,724 --> 00:25:15,734
- Come on out.
- Hurry up.

685
00:25:17,364 --> 00:25:18,803
The sunset will be gone. Hurry up.

686
00:25:18,804 --> 00:25:21,903
(While blushing in red shyly, the sun disappears slowly.)

687
00:25:21,904 --> 00:25:23,104
Hey. The sun sets right away.

688
00:25:25,644 --> 00:25:26,873
Gosh. It's beautiful.

689
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:28,143
(He's taking photos to capture the moment.)

690
00:25:28,144 --> 00:25:30,114
- I go overseas to take photos.
- Really?

691
00:25:31,914 --> 00:25:33,814
Hold on. It's so pretty.

692
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:36,953
I have to shoot this.

693
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,824
- It's crazy. It's our last night.
- Exactly.

694
00:25:40,024 --> 00:25:41,483
(The beautiful scenery that is like a gift from nature)

695
00:25:41,484 --> 00:25:43,324
What a majestic view.

696
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:45,294
Okay.

697
00:25:45,864 --> 00:25:47,764
I think you can post this.

698
00:25:48,864 --> 00:25:51,634
(They're capturing the sunset in their own ways.)

699
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:54,404
- Let's take a selfie together.
- Okay.

700
00:25:55,104 --> 00:25:56,434
One, two, three.

701
00:25:58,004 --> 00:26:00,285
(Like the setting sun, their journey is nearing the end.)

702
00:26:00,944 --> 00:26:03,113
(Hopefully, they'll remember this moment filled with memories...)

703
00:26:03,114 --> 00:26:04,644
(for a long time.)

704
00:26:13,284 --> 00:26:14,584
I'm getting hungry.

705
00:26:14,784 --> 00:26:17,223
Chef, I'm hungry.

706
00:26:17,224 --> 00:26:18,940
(Even today, Foodie Si A never loses her appetite.)

707
00:26:18,964 --> 00:26:21,863
(Si A turns her hunger into a song.)

708
00:26:21,864 --> 00:26:23,994
(She joins the singing.)

709
00:26:24,834 --> 00:26:26,304
A Sung, can you harmonize?

710
00:26:26,704 --> 00:26:28,733
No, I can't.

711
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:30,333
Go ahead and sing.

712
00:26:30,334 --> 00:26:31,694
- I'll harmonize with you.
- Okay.

713
00:26:32,004 --> 00:26:35,304
(I'm in love with you)

714
00:26:35,874 --> 00:26:38,374
I'm just making it up on the go.

715
00:26:38,914 --> 00:26:41,313
- Let's do it again. Let's go.
- Let's go.

716
00:26:41,314 --> 00:26:42,583
(Their reattempt to harmonize fails.)

717
00:26:42,584 --> 00:26:44,414
(It's even off-beat.)

718
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:47,153
(She even gets the words wrong.)

719
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:48,423
(They don't give up.)

720
00:26:48,424 --> 00:26:49,424
What do you say?

721
00:26:49,894 --> 00:26:51,523
- It was terrible.
- Was it all right?

722
00:26:51,524 --> 00:26:52,924
This is what dissonance is.

723
00:26:53,624 --> 00:26:55,634
(If they're cooking harmoniously, it's all good.)

724
00:26:55,734 --> 00:26:58,394
Okay. Let's do it.

725
00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:00,404
I'll prepare the carrots and all.

726
00:27:01,004 --> 00:27:02,233
I'll prepare the ingredients.

727
00:27:02,234 --> 00:27:03,234
Smash them.

728
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:05,374
(Yo Han is in charge of washing the ingredients.)

729
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:06,774
I'll peel them.

730
00:27:06,775 --> 00:27:08,380
(Jung Nam is in charge of preparing the ingredients.)

731
00:27:08,404 --> 00:27:09,414
How much should I slice?

732
00:27:10,444 --> 00:27:12,483
I think these two will be enough.

733
00:27:12,484 --> 00:27:14,814
- It should be thin, right?
- Yes. Slice it thinly.

734
00:27:15,014 --> 00:27:16,014
- Slice it thinly?
- Yes.

735
00:27:16,254 --> 00:27:18,013
Should I start the broth for tteokbokki...

736
00:27:18,014 --> 00:27:19,024
- here?
- Yes.

737
00:27:19,654 --> 00:27:22,054
(Si A is the main chef for the tteokbokki.)

738
00:27:22,854 --> 00:27:26,364
(Eddie's favorite Korean dishes made by the Country members)

739
00:27:27,264 --> 00:27:28,823
(A Sung is the main chef for gimbap.)

740
00:27:28,824 --> 00:27:30,384
(Si A is the main chef for tteokbokki.)

741
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:32,433
What do you think? Does this look like a good size?

742
00:27:32,434 --> 00:27:33,764
- Yes.
- It's perfect.

743
00:27:35,134 --> 00:27:37,734
(They begin with Si A's tteokbokki.)

744
00:27:38,434 --> 00:27:42,644
(Adding garlic as a whole and tearing the green onions casually)

745
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:45,714
Gosh. Are you going to use it that big? Okay.

746
00:27:46,484 --> 00:27:50,484
What do you think of sweet tteokbokki?

747
00:27:51,014 --> 00:27:52,553
- I love it.
- Will it be all right?

748
00:27:52,554 --> 00:27:54,624
(No need to say it.)

749
00:27:55,454 --> 00:27:58,924
(What is Si A's secret in making a tasty tteokbokki?)

750
00:27:58,994 --> 00:28:01,824
Instead of using just water, I add sikhye to it.

751
00:28:02,494 --> 00:28:04,634
It's to enrich its sweetness.

752
00:28:04,994 --> 00:28:06,364
That's my recipe.

753
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:09,834
I use a little bit of gochujang and a lot of chili powder.

754
00:28:10,004 --> 00:28:11,924
I boil it while increasing its refreshing taste.

755
00:28:13,244 --> 00:28:16,344
(The tteokbokki broth with Si A's secret method)

756
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:18,414
(Adding the rice cake)

757
00:28:20,044 --> 00:28:21,383
(She also adds the mugwort rice cake that Eddie chose.)

758
00:28:21,384 --> 00:28:22,983
It's very soft, indeed.

759
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:23,984
I love it.

760
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,753
Since the broth is sweet,

761
00:28:26,754 --> 00:28:28,524
it goes well with the mugwort rice cake.

762
00:28:28,954 --> 00:28:31,324
(They are happy just thinking about it.)

763
00:28:31,624 --> 00:28:33,594
- We know it.
- We know it.

764
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:35,493
Goodness.

765
00:28:35,494 --> 00:28:38,894
(The bitter mugwort rice cake goes well with sweet tteokbokki.)

766
00:28:39,764 --> 00:28:41,140
Si A, do you want the fishcake now?

767
00:28:41,164 --> 00:28:42,303
No, not now.

768
00:28:42,304 --> 00:28:44,804
- Okay. I'll leave it here.
- I'll add it later. Thank you.

769
00:28:47,204 --> 00:28:50,114
(First, she adds a generous amount of the cabbage.)

770
00:28:50,174 --> 00:28:52,113
- Is it hard to eat?
- Did you roll the gimbap?

771
00:28:52,114 --> 00:28:53,213
- Yes, we did.
- Yes.

772
00:28:53,214 --> 00:28:54,613
- You already did it?
- It's all ready.

773
00:28:54,614 --> 00:28:55,614
We have three.

774
00:28:55,615 --> 00:28:57,295
It's getting cooked in an interesting way.

775
00:28:57,554 --> 00:28:58,814
- Cabbage is sweet.
- Yes.

776
00:29:00,184 --> 00:29:01,724
It's interesting. It's good.

777
00:29:02,184 --> 00:29:03,423
It's really good.

778
00:29:03,424 --> 00:29:07,464
(When it's boiled down to absorb the sauce, it's ready.)

779
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:10,533
(Smashing)

780
00:29:10,534 --> 00:29:12,440
(A mysterious sound echoes through the kitchen.)

781
00:29:12,464 --> 00:29:14,334
(What is this sound?)

782
00:29:14,564 --> 00:29:16,104
(Si A is making the noise.)

783
00:29:16,504 --> 00:29:18,274
(What is she doing?)

784
00:29:18,434 --> 00:29:20,744
Chef, do you know what a crushed cucumber is?

785
00:29:20,904 --> 00:29:22,773
- I'll make it for you.
- Okay.

786
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,334
(Making the crushed cucumber for Eddie)

787
00:29:24,674 --> 00:29:28,314
(It's the sound of the cucumber becoming tasty.)

788
00:29:28,484 --> 00:29:30,453
Should I make the seasoning for it?

789
00:29:30,454 --> 00:29:31,584
Please.

790
00:29:32,954 --> 00:29:36,854
(The challenges in cooking are limitless.)

791
00:29:37,194 --> 00:29:39,724
(Yo Han is going to try and make mala sauce.)

792
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:42,263
(Vinegar)

793
00:29:42,264 --> 00:29:44,093
(Oyster sauce)

794
00:29:44,094 --> 00:29:46,404
(Mala sauce)

795
00:29:47,064 --> 00:29:49,033
(Adding the ingredients without exact measurements)

796
00:29:49,034 --> 00:29:50,074
(Sugar)

797
00:29:50,804 --> 00:29:52,874
(It'll be good, right?)

798
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:55,074
(How does it taste?)

799
00:29:55,474 --> 00:29:56,843
(Mala sauce.)

800
00:29:56,844 --> 00:29:58,574
(Don't do this to me.)

801
00:29:59,884 --> 00:30:02,714
What do I do? The sauce...

802
00:30:04,484 --> 00:30:06,484
- I'll give it one last try.
- Okay.

803
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:09,893
(Into the base mala sauce, )

804
00:30:09,894 --> 00:30:13,964
(she adds the sweet and sour vinegar and sugar.)

805
00:30:14,624 --> 00:30:18,134
(With it, a simple yet addictive mala sauce is done!)

806
00:30:18,764 --> 00:30:21,864
(Lastly, pour the sauce over the crushed cucumber, )

807
00:30:22,774 --> 00:30:25,604
(and the Chinese-style cucumber side dish is done.)

808
00:30:25,774 --> 00:30:27,244
What is this? You made a snack?

809
00:30:27,574 --> 00:30:29,143
Yes, a cucumber snack.

810
00:30:29,144 --> 00:30:30,674
(How does the crushed cucumber taste?)

811
00:30:31,444 --> 00:30:33,944
Is it good? It's not bad, right, Kyun?

812
00:30:34,814 --> 00:30:36,713
(Jung Nam and A Sung try the crushed cucumber.)

813
00:30:36,714 --> 00:30:37,813
(She can't help but be amazed.)

814
00:30:37,814 --> 00:30:39,953
- It's good.
- Isn't it refreshing?

815
00:30:39,954 --> 00:30:41,183
It's delicious.

816
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:42,354
(This is it.)

817
00:30:42,494 --> 00:30:44,953
Isn't this served at a Chinese restaurant?

818
00:30:44,954 --> 00:30:46,994
(Don't Give Up The Mala Crushed Cucumber by Si A)

819
00:30:47,124 --> 00:30:49,233
It's almost done.

820
00:30:49,234 --> 00:30:50,470
(The tteokbokki has been boiled down.)

821
00:30:50,494 --> 00:30:52,633
- I'll top it with perilla leaves.
- Yes, on top.

822
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:53,674
Are you going to plate it?

823
00:30:53,964 --> 00:30:57,334
(Adding the perilla leaves)

824
00:30:58,674 --> 00:31:02,674
(Si A's tteokbokki is boiling down to completion.)

825
00:31:04,044 --> 00:31:06,014
(Why don't I taste-test it?)

826
00:31:06,814 --> 00:31:08,213
(Everyone is nervous.)

827
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:09,283
- What is it?
- Is it sweet?

828
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,383
Chef?

829
00:31:10,384 --> 00:31:11,613
(Dancing)

830
00:31:11,614 --> 00:31:13,454
- It's good, right?
- It's good.

831
00:31:13,554 --> 00:31:14,584
All done, yes?

832
00:31:15,054 --> 00:31:17,194
- It's so good.
- Okay.

833
00:31:17,494 --> 00:31:18,623
(An encore performance)

834
00:31:18,624 --> 00:31:19,984

(Si A's Sikhye Tteokbokki That'll Make You Dance)

All we need is the eel now.

840

(Leave the eel to me.)

841

(Eddie gets up as soon as he hears it.)

842
00:31:42,554 --> 00:31:45,314
(Hygiene is the top priority! He washes his hands first.)

843
00:31:45,924 --> 00:31:47,454
The eel.

844
00:31:47,624 --> 00:31:50,024
We'll cut it into small pieces, so it's easier.

845
00:31:50,924 --> 00:31:53,224
(Eddie wants to join the members' perfect teamwork.)

846

851
00:32:20,154 --> 00:32:22,523
Is this cooked enough?

852
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,224
Yes. That's good. Perfect.

853
00:32:24,594 --> 00:32:26,394
(It looks good even just by itself.)

854
00:32:27,124 --> 00:32:32,164
(The simple yet handful gimbap ingredients are ready.)

855
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,533

Let's make the gimbap.

857
00:32:37,134 --> 00:32:38,173
Do I use my hands?

858
00:32:38,174 --> 00:32:40,504
Yes. Coat your hands with sesame oil first.

859
00:32:41,004 --> 00:32:42,374
Okay. Let's dip it in.

860
00:32:43,244 --> 00:32:45,174
- We must make gimbap.
- Should I?

861
00:32:45,774 --> 00:32:48,343
Let the three of us make a row each at the same time.

862
00:32:48,344 --> 00:32:50,114
To think I'd make gimbap in my life.

863
00:32:50,284 --> 00:32:51,614
I don't think we'll need this.

864
00:32:52,114 --> 00:32:53,834
Give us a demonstration, and we'll make it.

865
00:32:53,954 --> 00:32:55,284
But I'm not that good either.

866
00:32:55,484 --> 00:32:57,923
- I free-style it.
- You do?

867
00:32:57,924 --> 00:33:01,024
There's a side that folds.

868
00:33:01,194 --> 00:33:03,694
- Place it down.
- Okay.

869
00:33:04,494 --> 00:33:05,533
(Applying a layer of sesame oil)

870
00:33:05,534 --> 00:33:06,763
With my hand.

871

(Applying a layer of sesame oil)

872
00:33:09,204 --> 00:33:10,473
Rest, Kyun.

873
00:33:10,474 --> 00:33:12,543
- You always cook for us.
- Right.

874
00:33:12,544 --> 00:33:15,804
If you think we're doing something wrong, tell us.

875
00:33:15,944 --> 00:33:17,674
Next is the rice.

876
00:33:19,614 --> 00:33:22,444
- Spread a thin layer of rice.
- My dried seaweed is torn.

877
00:33:22,614 --> 00:33:23,914
- In the center?
- Yes.

878
00:33:25,054 --> 00:33:26,824
Do I spread it in the center?

879
00:33:26,884 --> 00:33:27,954
Yes.

880
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:30,994
(A Sung's rice is evenly spread.)

881
00:33:31,454 --> 00:33:32,823
(Meanwhile, Yo Han isn't even half done.)

882
00:33:32,824 --> 00:33:34,223
A thin layer. Let's try it first.

883
00:33:34,224 --> 00:33:37,893
I heard gimbap was quite sensitive.

884
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:39,233
- It's true, right?
- Sensitive?

885
00:33:39,234 --> 00:33:41,233
- The sides can easily burst.
- True.

886
00:33:41,234 --> 00:33:42,874
It's not an easy job.

887
00:33:43,434 --> 00:33:44,533
Like this.

888
00:33:44,534 --> 00:33:46,143
(Spreading the rice while soothing the dried seaweed)

889
00:33:46,144 --> 00:33:48,264
(Spreading the rice while soothing the dried seaweed)

890
00:33:49,004 --> 00:33:51,713
It's best to place them slightly below the center.

891
00:33:51,714 --> 00:33:53,414
- Rolling it will be easier.
- Okay.

892
00:33:54,214 --> 00:33:56,283
- The spinach.
- It's the ingredients next, right?

893
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,814
Yes. Place a piece on top.

894
00:33:59,884 --> 00:34:01,984
(Yo Han's eyes are busier than his hands.)

895
00:34:02,924 --> 00:34:05,054
(The gimbap ingredients are placed neatly.)

896
00:34:05,894 --> 00:34:08,864
- I think a bit of carrots will do.
- Okay.

897
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:10,864
Carrots.

898
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:12,163
(Following the orders well.)

899
00:34:12,164 --> 00:34:13,203
And?

900
00:34:13,204 --> 00:34:15,533
(But he's just a little too delicate.)

901
00:34:15,534 --> 00:34:17,604
(Patting)

902
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:21,604
(Placing eels on the soothed gimbap)

903
00:34:23,414 --> 00:34:25,274
Press it down well.

904
00:34:26,184 --> 00:34:27,214
Press it down...

905
00:34:27,814 --> 00:34:28,914
with the roller mat.

906
00:34:30,384 --> 00:34:32,384
(He's super focused.)

907
00:34:33,284 --> 00:34:34,423
(Looking uneasy)

908
00:34:34,424 --> 00:34:36,093
- Press it down well.
- After this...

909
00:34:36,094 --> 00:34:37,924
Use the roller mat when you're ready.

910
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:39,264
- This?
- Yes.

911
00:34:39,524 --> 00:34:41,394
- Like this?
- Yes, and press it down.

912
00:34:41,864 --> 00:34:43,363
Lay it out a little.

913
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:44,993
- Roll the gimbap.
- Look at him.

914
00:34:44,994 --> 00:34:46,003
Very nice.

915
00:34:46,004 --> 00:34:47,004
(Good luck, Yo Han!)

916
00:34:49,164 --> 00:34:50,803
(A Sung's eel gimbap is done!)

917
00:34:50,804 --> 00:34:52,534
(Ta-da!)

918
00:34:53,174 --> 00:34:55,244
(How did Yo Han's gimbap turn out?)

919
00:34:55,974 --> 00:34:57,213
(It has refused to be completed.)

920
00:34:57,214 --> 00:34:59,314
(The end hasn't stuck.)

921
00:34:59,614 --> 00:35:01,844
The end of mine is still open.

922
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:04,614
(Meanwhile, Si A is still in the kitchen.)

923
00:35:05,384 --> 00:35:07,624
(Pork belly out of the blue?)

924
00:35:08,354 --> 00:35:10,994
I always liked putting pork belly in my gimbap.

925
00:35:11,094 --> 00:35:12,424
It's delicious.

926
00:35:12,764 --> 00:35:13,964
The upside of pork belly...

927
00:35:14,664 --> 00:35:17,024
is that I never get sick of it, even if I eat it every day.

928
00:35:17,334 --> 00:35:19,503
It's good even with cheese, kimchi,

929
00:35:19,504 --> 00:35:20,603
salt dipping,

930
00:35:20,604 --> 00:35:22,464
stir-fried, and as a stew.

931
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,104
Pork belly is an all-time legend.

932
00:35:25,234 --> 00:35:26,403
(The second gimbap ingredient is done.)

933
00:35:26,404 --> 00:35:28,773
The pork belly is done.

934
00:35:28,774 --> 00:35:30,073
They're almost ready.

935
00:35:30,074 --> 00:35:32,014
- I'm done too.
- Is that so?

936
00:35:32,614 --> 00:35:33,843
(She stir-fried kimchi too.)

937
00:35:33,844 --> 00:35:35,014
(Foodie Si A is satisfied.)

938
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:39,034
(More gimbap ingredients have been added, thanks to Si A.)

939
00:35:39,154 --> 00:35:40,754
I'm going to roll one pork belly gimbap.

940
00:35:41,384 --> 00:35:42,653
That's my idea.

941
00:35:42,654 --> 00:35:44,293
- Really?
- For real?

942
00:35:44,294 --> 00:35:48,094
I bet we're sharing the same brain, Chef.

943
00:35:49,434 --> 00:35:51,834
(Eddie's gimbap refuses to be normal.)

944
00:35:53,934 --> 00:35:55,764
(The chef is making it unique.)

945
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,724
(After only spreading rice on half of the dried seaweed, )

946
00:36:00,004 --> 00:36:02,444
(place ingredients on every quarter.)

947
00:36:04,014 --> 00:36:06,684
(Cut into the middle of the dried seaweed's center.)

948
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:11,914
(Once the empty space is filled with stir-fried kimchi, )

949
00:36:13,784 --> 00:36:16,354
(fold each side.)

950
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:18,754
I've seen this.

951
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:20,764
It looks good.

952
00:36:20,924 --> 00:36:21,924
Nice.

953
00:36:21,925 --> 00:36:24,664
What is it? Folded gimbap?

954
00:36:24,694 --> 00:36:25,694
It's cute.

955
00:36:26,404 --> 00:36:28,903
It's a gimbap sandwich or a gimbap burger.

956
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:30,174
(Digging in)

957
00:36:30,504 --> 00:36:31,574
Is it good?

958
00:36:31,934 --> 00:36:33,644
(I'm so happy.)

959
00:36:34,204 --> 00:36:35,603
(I want to try it too.)

960
00:36:35,604 --> 00:36:36,844
I'd like a bite.

961
00:36:37,374 --> 00:36:40,344
True. It's sold like a triangle gimbap.

962
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:41,514
Gosh.

963
00:36:42,014 --> 00:36:43,384
It's delicious.

964
00:36:48,454 --> 00:36:50,524
(The Busan guy also likes it.)

965
00:36:50,824 --> 00:36:51,853
(Eddie is proud.)

966
00:36:51,854 --> 00:36:53,854
(Stir-fried kimchi and pork belly can't go wrong.)

967
00:36:53,924 --> 00:36:56,634
(Eddie's kimchi pork belly folded gimbap is a success!)

968
00:36:57,834 --> 00:37:00,834
(Even more excited for Si A's gimbap after trying the folded gimbap)

969
00:37:00,904 --> 00:37:02,563
- Where is it?
- I'm going to put in chili.

970
00:37:02,564 --> 00:37:03,604
Okay.

971
00:37:06,144 --> 00:37:08,874
I'll place one chili on top.

972
00:37:09,274 --> 00:37:11,943
- You added chili?
- Yes, we had some.

973
00:37:11,944 --> 00:37:13,784
(The key to Si A's gimbap is the whole chili!)

974
00:37:15,314 --> 00:37:17,353
Pork belly? Gosh.

975
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:18,614
It's pork belly gimbap.

976
00:37:20,784 --> 00:37:23,194
(Finishing it off with some cheese)

977
00:37:29,294 --> 00:37:30,864
It looks appetizing.

978
00:37:31,434 --> 00:37:32,593
The gimbap...

979
00:37:32,594 --> 00:37:34,434
(Topping the wrapped gimbap with sesame seeds)

980
00:37:35,304 --> 00:37:37,904
(How did the gimbap made with meticulous hands turn out?)

981
00:37:39,374 --> 00:37:42,274
- I'm plating mine.
- Okay. Great.

982
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:45,013
One more, please. It's pretty.

983
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:46,314
I'm so happy.

984
00:37:47,384 --> 00:37:49,853
My favorite foods are tteokbokki and gimbap.

985
00:37:49,854 --> 00:37:51,213
- Me too.
- Same here.

986
00:37:51,214 --> 00:37:53,124
- Snack bar food is the best.
- No doubt.

987
00:37:55,054 --> 00:37:56,123
- And...
- A bowl.

988
00:37:56,124 --> 00:37:57,884
(A table of Country members' snack bar food)

989
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,264
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

990
00:38:01,824 --> 00:38:04,263
- I'm starting with tteokbokki.
- Or...

991
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:05,434
Gosh, let's dig in.

992
00:38:06,204 --> 00:38:09,234
(How does tteokbokki made with mugwort rice cake taste?)

993
00:38:10,674 --> 00:38:12,504
(Eddie tries the mugwort rice cake first.)

994
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:14,344
(Amazed)

995
00:38:14,374 --> 00:38:15,443
(Nodding of approval)

996
00:38:15,444 --> 00:38:16,974
Goodness, look at the tteokbokki.

997
00:38:17,444 --> 00:38:18,973
Is it rice cake or flour cake?

998
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:21,043
- It's rice cake.
- It looks like rice cake.

999
00:38:21,044 --> 00:38:22,243
Let me give you some.

1000
00:38:22,244 --> 00:38:23,754
(A taste you can't stop eating)

1001
00:38:24,884 --> 00:38:26,784
(Jung Nam is going to have a bite too.)

1002
00:38:29,384 --> 00:38:30,823
And the gimbap.

1003
00:38:30,824 --> 00:38:33,693
(A Sung and Yo Han also try the tteokbokki first.)

1004
00:38:33,694 --> 00:38:34,964
You can whip it up.

1005
00:38:36,024 --> 00:38:37,693
(Impressed)

1006
00:38:37,694 --> 00:38:39,063
- It's good.
- On high heat?

1007
00:38:39,064 --> 00:38:41,233
- The rice cake is delicious.
- What happened?

1008
00:38:41,234 --> 00:38:43,433
I love soft rice cake.

1009
00:38:43,434 --> 00:38:44,954
(The rice cake's softness is a charm.)

1010
00:38:46,974 --> 00:38:48,843
Should we just eat it as a whole?

1011
00:38:48,844 --> 00:38:50,674
I couldn't cut it.

1012
00:38:51,814 --> 00:38:54,844
(Gimbap with Si A's favorite pork belly)

1013
00:38:57,214 --> 00:38:58,553
(Eating it right away)

1014
00:38:58,554 --> 00:38:59,854
It looks good.

1015
00:39:00,854 --> 00:39:02,854
(Not missing the pork belly that came out)

1016
00:39:04,724 --> 00:39:06,563
(Her mouth is filled with pork belly gimbap.)

1017
00:39:06,564 --> 00:39:08,494
(Stuffed cheeks)

1018
00:39:10,034 --> 00:39:11,264
It's so good.

1019
00:39:13,864 --> 00:39:16,874
(The ingredients inside the gimbap are distinctive.)

1020
00:39:19,674 --> 00:39:20,774
What gimbap is this?

1021
00:39:21,074 --> 00:39:23,044
The one A Sung made.

1022
00:39:23,244 --> 00:39:24,474
(Next is eel gimbap.)

1023
00:39:27,544 --> 00:39:29,484
(Amazed)

1024
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:33,484
The one A Sung made.

1025
00:39:33,584 --> 00:39:36,724
(How does the eel gimbap taste?)

1026
00:39:37,054 --> 00:39:38,124
It's good.

1027
00:39:38,954 --> 00:39:41,354
I'm not good with greasy food, but this isn't greasy at all.

1028
00:39:41,564 --> 00:39:42,824
It's amazing.

1029
00:39:45,294 --> 00:39:48,464
(Si A is lost in the whirlpool of delicious food.)

1030
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:51,804
It tastes just like gimbap made by my mom.

1031
00:39:51,974 --> 00:39:53,044
For real.

1032
00:39:54,644 --> 00:39:56,574
It does taste like homemade gimbap. I love it.

1033
00:39:57,744 --> 00:39:59,684
Right? I made it.

1034
00:40:01,384 --> 00:40:03,214
Don't you love yourself a little too much?

1035
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,513
To think I'd eat gimbap made by me.

1036
00:40:05,514 --> 00:40:06,783
(Food made by oneself is better!)

1037
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:08,323
I never rolled gimbap before.

1038
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:09,553
But it was fun.

1039
00:40:09,554 --> 00:40:10,823
(Great work, everyone.)

1040
00:40:10,824 --> 00:40:12,094
Chef.

1041
00:40:12,894 --> 00:40:15,964
Is your schedule packed when you return to the US?

1042
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:18,634
(Thinking)

1043
00:40:19,364 --> 00:40:20,734
Maybe I'll stay in Korea.

1044
00:40:22,034 --> 00:40:24,034
- Maybe.
- What?

1045
00:40:25,034 --> 00:40:27,043
Maybe I'll never go back. I don't know.

1046
00:40:27,044 --> 00:40:28,124
Do you not want to go back?

1047
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:30,214
- That was a nice answer.
- Right?

1048
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,444
It's my dream. It's my fantasy.

1049
00:40:33,414 --> 00:40:36,914
Is there a menu you want to develop for your restaurant...

1050
00:40:37,314 --> 00:40:40,084
inspired by this trip?

1051
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:44,524
Not at the moment.

1052
00:40:44,824 --> 00:40:47,293
I'm currently fermenting...

1053
00:40:47,294 --> 00:40:50,763
what I've learned in my head.

1054
00:40:50,764 --> 00:40:52,794
- Fermenting?
- Fermenting in my head.

1055
00:40:53,204 --> 00:40:56,204
Some idea will pop up in my head later.

1056
00:40:56,374 --> 00:40:59,504
"I'm going to do that."

1057
00:40:59,844 --> 00:41:01,144
I'm not like that.

1058
00:41:01,644 --> 00:41:03,543
I let it sit in my head.

1059
00:41:03,544 --> 00:41:05,873
He's right. People also need fermentation.

1060
00:41:05,874 --> 00:41:06,884
Exactly.

1061
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:09,854
- Gesign.
- "Gesign?"

1062
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:12,184
Kyun.

1063
00:41:12,784 --> 00:41:14,583
Did you understand what he said?

1064
00:41:14,584 --> 00:41:15,624
Design?

1065
00:41:17,054 --> 00:41:18,994
(Design?)

1066
00:41:19,764 --> 00:41:21,624
Say it again.

1067
00:41:21,864 --> 00:41:23,164
- Gesign.
- "Gesign."

1068
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,934
"Gesign?" What is that?

1069
00:41:26,164 --> 00:41:27,433
- Isn't it?
- Right?

1070
00:41:27,434 --> 00:41:28,704
- Right?
- Right?

1071
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,173
- Really?
- In a dialect.

1072
00:41:31,174 --> 00:41:32,203
- Gesign?
- Gesign.

1073
00:41:32,204 --> 00:41:33,204
Gesign.

1074
00:41:34,204 --> 00:41:35,274
Gesign.

1075
00:41:37,074 --> 00:41:38,974
Did you have a favorite meal?

1076
00:41:39,214 --> 00:41:41,644
In the last two weeks. A favorite dish.

1077
00:41:42,044 --> 00:41:44,014
- A favorite dish.
- Everything was good.

1078
00:41:44,684 --> 00:41:47,053
Number one for me was the octopus chimichurri.

1079
00:41:47,054 --> 00:41:48,283
(Si A's top pick)

1080
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:49,723
- That was...
- It was our first night.

1081
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:52,093
That food left a big impression,

1082
00:41:52,094 --> 00:41:53,563
- Right.
- like it was the best dish ever.

1083
00:41:53,564 --> 00:41:54,564
- Really?
- Yes.

1084
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:55,993
The octopus chimichurri was the best.

1085
00:41:55,994 --> 00:41:58,110
(Eddie's octopus chimichurri is Si A's best food ever.)

1086
00:41:58,134 --> 00:41:59,963
- That food left a big impression, - It's porridge for me.

1087
00:41:59,964 --> 00:42:01,003
Like it was the best dish ever.

1088
00:42:01,004 --> 00:42:02,133
- Porridge.
- Porridge?

1089
00:42:02,134 --> 00:42:03,874
Thank you.

1090
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:07,944
(Nurungji abalone porridge shared with the haenyeos)

1091
00:42:09,604 --> 00:42:12,214
As for me, it's the pickled garlic sauce.

1092
00:42:12,414 --> 00:42:13,414
That?

1093
00:42:13,415 --> 00:42:15,044
It was right up my street.

1094
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:16,913
- The pickled garlic.
- With the steak?

1095
00:42:16,914 --> 00:42:18,554
With steak. It was delicious.

1096
00:42:21,154 --> 00:42:22,453
Actually...

1097
00:42:22,454 --> 00:42:23,893
(What's Eddie's top pick?)

1098
00:42:23,894 --> 00:42:28,064
I love tonight's dinner the most.

1099
00:42:28,324 --> 00:42:29,423
- Really?
- Yes.

1100
00:42:29,424 --> 00:42:31,893
At first,

1101
00:42:31,894 --> 00:42:33,163
(At first...)

1102
00:42:33,164 --> 00:42:35,264
we weren't that close.

1103
00:42:35,404 --> 00:42:37,974
- True.
- But now, we're close.

1104
00:42:38,204 --> 00:42:41,104
We've become good friends, which makes this meal the best.

1105
00:42:41,444 --> 00:42:42,843
- True.
- We made it all together.

1106
00:42:42,844 --> 00:42:44,514
- So, thank you.
- Thank you.

1107
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:46,414
I'm bummed out.

1108
00:42:47,244 --> 00:42:48,444
- Are you?
- Yes.

1109
00:42:49,444 --> 00:42:51,783
- We have one more meal.
- Exactly.

1110
00:42:51,784 --> 00:42:53,300
- We have another day left.
- Tomorrow.

1111
00:42:53,324 --> 00:42:54,684
What are we having tomorrow, Chef?

1112
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:57,323
I will go to sleep and dream...

1113
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:58,823
about the menu tomorrow.

1114
00:42:58,824 --> 00:43:00,424
- Okay.
- And when I wake up,

1115
00:43:00,664 --> 00:43:01,964
I'll have it all in my head.

1116
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:04,293
(Eddie, you really are...)

1117
00:43:04,294 --> 00:43:06,264
It'll pop up in my dream.

1118
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:09,874
(Revealed in a little bit)

1119
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:13,504
(The last special Eddie-tion dining)

1120
00:43:14,674 --> 00:43:17,473
(The homemade taste of Gangwon, Yeosu, and Andong)

1121
00:43:17,474 --> 00:43:20,044
(Together with Eddie's recipe)

1122
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:24,414
(The last chapter of the tastes' history)

1123
00:43:24,914 --> 00:43:26,483
(It's incredible.)

1124
00:43:26,484 --> 00:43:27,484
It's good, right?

1125
00:43:27,485 --> 00:43:30,024
(The tear-jerking delicious meal is coming soon.)

1126
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:32,593
(The trip's last night is coming to an end.)

1127
00:43:32,594 --> 00:43:33,663
- Jung Nam.
- Yes?

1128
00:43:33,664 --> 00:43:35,994
- Leave a little later.
- I'll go after a drink.

1129
00:43:36,164 --> 00:43:38,194
I washed some strawberries.

1130
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:39,394
- What?
- Strawberries.

1131
00:43:39,395 --> 00:43:40,675
Strawberries? Put it over there.

1132
00:43:42,334 --> 00:43:43,733
- Strawberry sounds good.
- Strawberries.

1133
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:45,104
Should I bring it over too?

1134
00:43:45,774 --> 00:43:46,804
Gosh.

1135
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:49,374
I really want your whiskey right now.

1136
00:43:51,274 --> 00:43:52,773
Is that sikhye?

1137
00:43:52,774 --> 00:43:54,094
- Sikhye?
- It's sikhye and beer.

1138
00:43:54,344 --> 00:43:55,514
Sikhye beer.

1139
00:43:56,184 --> 00:43:57,214
Sikhye.

1140
00:43:57,314 --> 00:43:59,783
- This should do.
- You did well.

1141
00:43:59,784 --> 00:44:01,354
Don't praise me too much.

1142
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:02,783
We only have a day left.

1143
00:44:02,784 --> 00:44:04,704
(The members and Jung Nam spend the last night.)

1144
00:44:05,694 --> 00:44:07,294
- I had fun, Bro Kyun.
- Good.

1145
00:44:07,624 --> 00:44:09,163
It was wonderful to meet you.

1146
00:44:09,164 --> 00:44:10,194
For real.

1147
00:44:10,394 --> 00:44:11,693
Have some strawberries.

1148
00:44:11,694 --> 00:44:13,164
- Okay.
- As dessert.

1149
00:44:13,504 --> 00:44:15,204
(Digging in right away)

1150
00:44:15,464 --> 00:44:17,874
The bonfire is nice.

1151
00:44:18,204 --> 00:44:19,274
Goodness.

1152
00:44:19,674 --> 00:44:20,704
Gosh.

1153
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:22,774
Do you know the perilla leaf controversy?

1154
00:44:23,214 --> 00:44:24,343
Perilla leaf conversation?

1155
00:44:24,344 --> 00:44:25,773
(Perilla leaf conversation?)

1156
00:44:25,774 --> 00:44:27,784
- Perilla leaf controversy?
- Do you know it?

1157
00:44:28,044 --> 00:44:29,813
Isn't it about picking it out with your chopsticks?

1158
00:44:29,814 --> 00:44:30,814
Yes.

1159
00:44:30,815 --> 00:44:32,513
Say that I'm with my partner...

1160
00:44:32,514 --> 00:44:34,123
and my friend.

1161
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:36,454
My friend is trying to pick out a perilla leaf.

1162
00:44:36,554 --> 00:44:37,723
- But...
- What do you think?

1163
00:44:37,724 --> 00:44:39,194
Can't you just help the friend out?

1164
00:44:39,424 --> 00:44:40,984
What if your partner feeds your friend?

1165
00:44:41,664 --> 00:44:43,233
(Don't cross the line, Yo Han!)

1166
00:44:43,234 --> 00:44:45,094
- Come on.
- Feeding is a no.

1167
00:44:45,194 --> 00:44:46,394
I don't mind.

1168
00:44:46,804 --> 00:44:48,704
Feeding is a little...

1169
00:44:48,834 --> 00:44:50,373
Are you kidding me?

1170
00:44:50,374 --> 00:44:52,374
- For real?
- We're old now.

1171
00:44:52,904 --> 00:44:54,674
What about this? Here's an example.

1172
00:44:55,044 --> 00:44:56,343
Say that we're going out.

1173
00:44:56,344 --> 00:44:58,543
But my friend...

1174
00:44:58,544 --> 00:45:01,083
My partner is trying to zip his jacket up,

1175
00:45:01,084 --> 00:45:02,643
- but everyone's hands are full.
- All full.

1176
00:45:02,644 --> 00:45:07,024
My friend helps my partner zip his jacket up.

1177
00:45:07,524 --> 00:45:09,924
- He has no free hands?
- No, neither do I.

1178
00:45:10,154 --> 00:45:11,824
(Then...)

1179
00:45:12,524 --> 00:45:14,193
The friend zips it up to the top.

1180
00:45:14,194 --> 00:45:15,663
- After zipping it up, - Listen.

1181
00:45:15,664 --> 00:45:17,363
- she taps your partner's shoulder.
- So it's like...

1182
00:45:17,364 --> 00:45:19,194
If you're carrying stuff in both hands.

1183
00:45:19,294 --> 00:45:21,763
It's okay if the friend zips it up because your hands are full.

1184
00:45:21,764 --> 00:45:23,733
But zipping it up when your hands are free?

1185
00:45:23,734 --> 00:45:25,604
I'd say, "Are you crazy?"

1186
00:45:26,304 --> 00:45:27,474
That's what I'd say.

1187
00:45:27,844 --> 00:45:31,113
But if both hands are occupied, it's okay.

1188
00:45:31,114 --> 00:45:32,873
Honestly, I'm fine with everything.

1189
00:45:32,874 --> 00:45:34,243
Of course.

1190
00:45:34,244 --> 00:45:35,884
- My friend can zip it up.
- If...

1191
00:45:36,114 --> 00:45:37,713
- It's zipping up the jacket, - Yes, the zipper.

1192
00:45:37,714 --> 00:45:39,814
- not the pants.
- Right?

1193
00:45:40,284 --> 00:45:41,853
(The American guy is different.)

1194
00:45:41,854 --> 00:45:43,293
- Chef.
- Really, Chef.

1195
00:45:43,294 --> 00:45:44,453
(Stop your imagination, Eddie.)

1196
00:45:44,454 --> 00:45:45,454
- Chef.
- Chef.

1197
00:45:45,455 --> 00:45:47,093
- The jacket is okay.
- That was...

1198
00:45:47,094 --> 00:45:48,523
(The Kentucky guy's thinking is different.)

1199
00:45:48,524 --> 00:45:50,493
- That's a no.
- Of course.

1200
00:45:50,494 --> 00:45:51,533
That's a problem.

1201
00:45:51,534 --> 00:45:52,963
- No.
- That would be a problem.

1202
00:45:52,964 --> 00:45:55,004
- Your fly is open.
- No way.

1203
00:45:55,234 --> 00:45:56,774
I can't accept it.

1204
00:45:57,104 --> 00:45:58,774
- It'll make me angry.
- That...

1205
00:45:58,904 --> 00:46:00,973
What about a necktie? Tying the necktie.

1206
00:46:00,974 --> 00:46:01,974
A necktie?

1207
00:46:01,975 --> 00:46:03,855
- That's very personal.
- What about a necktie?

1208
00:46:04,074 --> 00:46:05,843
(How is necktie for the cool Yo Han?)

1209
00:46:05,844 --> 00:46:06,883
A necktie?

1210
00:46:06,884 --> 00:46:08,720
- That's very personal.
- What about a necktie?

1211
00:46:08,744 --> 00:46:09,813
- No way.
- That's very personal.

1212
00:46:09,814 --> 00:46:11,554
- My girlfriend...
- Right.

1213
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:14,183
- No.
- ties my friend's necktie.

1214
00:46:14,184 --> 00:46:15,184
No?

1215
00:46:15,184 --> 00:46:16,184
- No.
- No.

1216
00:46:16,554 --> 00:46:17,853
- That's very personal.
- You don't accept many things.

1217
00:46:17,854 --> 00:46:18,993
Not the necktie.

1218
00:46:18,994 --> 00:46:21,823
The necktie symbolizes...

1219
00:46:21,824 --> 00:46:23,393
- a man.
- No way.

1220
00:46:23,394 --> 00:46:24,394
A necktie is a no.

1221
00:46:24,395 --> 00:46:26,064
I'll strangle him with the necktie.

1222
00:46:26,664 --> 00:46:28,434
"You little... How dare you?"

1223
00:46:28,904 --> 00:46:30,133
That'd be me.

1224
00:46:30,134 --> 00:46:31,303
(I'm sorry I can't be cool.)

1225
00:46:31,304 --> 00:46:32,504
That'll be what happens.

1226
00:46:33,574 --> 00:46:35,544
A Sung prepared something.

1227
00:46:36,104 --> 00:46:37,373
(A Sung's surprise event)

1228
00:46:37,374 --> 00:46:39,944
- Yes.
- Today is for the chef...

1229
00:46:40,614 --> 00:46:42,083
and our last night.

1230
00:46:42,084 --> 00:46:43,284
(Playing the guitar for Eddie)

1231
00:46:43,354 --> 00:46:44,354
But...

1232
00:46:44,784 --> 00:46:48,424
We have to sing all together.

1233
00:46:48,454 --> 00:46:49,923
- Okay.
- What song?

1234
00:46:49,924 --> 00:46:51,193
"My Love By My Side."

1235
00:46:51,194 --> 00:46:53,024
- Nice.
- By Kim Hyun Sik.

1236
00:46:54,694 --> 00:46:56,194
(Actually, Eddie...)

1237
00:46:56,464 --> 00:46:57,994
(I need to find a hipster karaoke.)

1238
00:46:58,094 --> 00:46:59,434
(Now, I need a microphone.)

1239
00:46:59,934 --> 00:47:02,234
(Eddie's love for karaoke is uncontrollable.)

1240
00:47:03,504 --> 00:47:05,674
I like Kim Hyun Sik.

1241
00:47:06,474 --> 00:47:10,574
(Eddie's favorite singer is the late Kim Hyun Sik.)

1242
00:47:10,944 --> 00:47:12,214
Since it was the last night,

1243
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:15,743
I wanted us to sing together while I played the guitar.

1244
00:47:15,744 --> 00:47:17,554
That was why I prepared it.

1245
00:47:19,384 --> 00:47:20,623
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1246
00:47:20,624 --> 00:47:21,624
Let's go.

1247
00:47:21,625 --> 00:47:24,454
("My Love By My Side" covered by Country members and Jung Nam)

1248
00:47:25,294 --> 00:47:28,524
(The mellow sound of the guitar fills the yard.)

1249
00:47:31,264 --> 00:47:34,003
(How will Eddie sing "My Love By My Side?")

1250
00:47:34,004 --> 00:47:35,404
Go.

1251
00:47:36,134 --> 00:47:37,974
- The day all my love - The day all my love

1252
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:39,807
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

1253
00:47:39,808 --> 00:47:40,817
Let's go.

1254
00:47:40,818 --> 00:47:43,588
("My Love By My Side" covered by Country members and Jung Nam)

1255
00:47:44,488 --> 00:47:47,718
(The mellow sound of the guitar fills the yard.)

1256
00:47:50,558 --> 00:47:53,187
(How will Eddie sing "My Love By My Side?")

1257
00:47:53,188 --> 00:47:54,728
Go.

1258
00:47:55,858 --> 00:47:58,198
(The day all my love)

1259
00:47:58,568 --> 00:47:59,828
(Feeling embarrassed)

1260
00:48:00,638 --> 00:48:02,438
(It's okay, Kyun. Sing along.)

1261
00:48:03,168 --> 00:48:06,707
(I walk together)

1262
00:48:06,708 --> 00:48:09,078
(Behind your smile)

1263
00:48:10,008 --> 00:48:13,717
(Because of my childish greed)

1264
00:48:13,718 --> 00:48:16,148
(And lingering attachments)

1265
00:48:17,388 --> 00:48:20,218
(Eddie isn't good at it, but he still sings with sincerity.)

1266
00:48:21,418 --> 00:48:23,687
- Could it?
- Could it?

1267
00:48:23,688 --> 00:48:25,028
You're a good singer.

1268
00:48:26,728 --> 00:48:30,098
(Between those fragile branches)

1269
00:48:30,198 --> 00:48:33,168
(When I feel lonely)

1270
00:48:33,698 --> 00:48:34,897
(Such a painful memory of you)

1271
00:48:34,898 --> 00:48:36,218
(I'll keep this with me forever.)

1272
00:48:36,298 --> 00:48:37,537
(A video filmed by Si A)

1273
00:48:37,538 --> 00:48:41,208
(Will I be reminded of you?)

1274
00:48:43,608 --> 00:48:46,407
(My beloved Country members)

1275
00:48:46,408 --> 00:48:49,818
(Please stay by my side)

1276
00:48:50,718 --> 00:48:56,828
(One and only Country members)

1277
00:48:57,528 --> 00:49:00,627
(I'm having a rough day)

1278
00:49:00,628 --> 00:49:03,568
(If you leave me too)

1279
00:49:04,798 --> 00:49:07,967
(I might stumble)

1280
00:49:07,968 --> 00:49:10,668
(Who will I turn to for an embrace)

1281
00:49:11,108 --> 00:49:12,237
- Once more!
- You're good.

1282
00:49:12,238 --> 00:49:13,638
(Everyone!)

1283
00:49:15,738 --> 00:49:19,447
(Country members by my side)

1284
00:49:19,448 --> 00:49:21,348
- You're a good singer.
- Thank you.

1285
00:49:21,978 --> 00:49:24,218
- Did you know this song?
- Why are you so good?

1286
00:49:24,318 --> 00:49:25,617
- Do you like this song?
- A bit.

1287
00:49:25,618 --> 00:49:27,988
- No wonder you know the lyrics.
- You're so good.

1288
00:49:28,688 --> 00:49:31,128
I remember the first time I was in Korea.

1289
00:49:32,328 --> 00:49:34,557
- Maybe 15 or 20 years ago.
- Yes.

1290
00:49:34,558 --> 00:49:38,128
The moment I first heard it, I felt it in my soul.

1291
00:49:38,228 --> 00:49:40,067
I didn't know the meaning of the words.

1292
00:49:40,068 --> 00:49:41,544
- You didn't know the meaning.
- Not at all.

1293
00:49:41,568 --> 00:49:42,937
But I felt it in my soul.

1294
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:44,438
- Soul?
- Soul.

1295
00:49:44,708 --> 00:49:46,838
That's the Korean DNA in you.

1296
00:49:47,438 --> 00:49:49,578
You really like singing, don't you?

1297
00:49:49,678 --> 00:49:52,208
I can feel that you're enjoying it.

1298
00:49:52,808 --> 00:49:55,518
(Eddie sings soulfully.)

1299
00:49:56,018 --> 00:49:59,118
When Edward sang "My Love By My Side,"

1300
00:49:59,418 --> 00:50:01,758
it felt very strange.

1301
00:50:02,258 --> 00:50:04,188
He lived in the States, which is far away,

1302
00:50:04,728 --> 00:50:07,558
but he always stayed close to Korea.

1303
00:50:08,758 --> 00:50:10,527
I thought he was cool.

1304
00:50:10,528 --> 00:50:11,767
(Eddie looked cool.)

1305
00:50:11,768 --> 00:50:12,768
Yes.

1306
00:50:14,098 --> 00:50:15,198
It's nice.

1307
00:50:15,398 --> 00:50:17,007
(We can't do without a picture in this nice atmosphere.)

1308
00:50:17,008 --> 00:50:18,608
Our photographer is back.

1309
00:50:19,508 --> 00:50:22,378
Here I go. One, two, three.

1310
00:50:23,378 --> 00:50:24,778
Smile, 1, 2, 3.

1311
00:50:25,578 --> 00:50:26,678
Nice.

1312
00:50:27,048 --> 00:50:28,448
Isn't it pretty?

1313
00:50:28,548 --> 00:50:29,818
It is.

1314
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:32,018
I had a good rest.

1315
00:50:33,418 --> 00:50:34,418
- I'm off.
- Bye.

1316
00:50:34,419 --> 00:50:35,918
Don't see me off.

1317
00:50:38,188 --> 00:50:39,857
He said not to see him off.

1318
00:50:39,858 --> 00:50:41,197
(Dwelling on)

1319
00:50:41,198 --> 00:50:44,368
He's really not coming to see me off, that punk.

1320
00:50:45,268 --> 00:50:46,328
We're not.

1321
00:50:46,938 --> 00:50:48,098
- We're not.
- I'll call you.

1322
00:50:48,938 --> 00:50:51,868
That means he really wants us to, you know?

1323
00:50:51,968 --> 00:50:54,038
Yes. "Don't see me off" means "please see me off."

1324
00:50:55,078 --> 00:50:57,408
That's exactly why we shouldn't see him off.

1325
00:50:58,248 --> 00:50:59,648
I made good memories.

1326
00:51:00,318 --> 00:51:01,348
I really did.

1327
00:51:01,948 --> 00:51:03,548
I spent my last night here...

1328
00:51:04,118 --> 00:51:07,918
with good people at a good place.

1329
00:51:10,218 --> 00:51:11,927
(The last night of the trip is full of beautiful memories.)

1330
00:51:11,928 --> 00:51:14,058
Thank you for your hard work.

1331
00:51:15,658 --> 00:51:19,698
(The final morning in Yeosu that they became attached to)

1332
00:51:21,968 --> 00:51:25,908
(Today marks the end of the journey. What awaits them today?)

1333
00:51:28,338 --> 00:51:31,378
(The Country members leave early in the morning?)

1334
00:51:38,088 --> 00:51:40,758
(Where are the other members?)

1335
00:51:42,618 --> 00:51:46,188
(Where is Eddie going?)

1336
00:51:47,698 --> 00:51:51,198
(He drives very far and arrives at an unknown place.)

1337
00:51:52,768 --> 00:51:55,238
(He enters without hesitation.)

1338
00:51:56,298 --> 00:51:59,568
(A restaurant without its owner or the customers)

1339
00:52:03,378 --> 00:52:05,978
(He trespasses the kitchen without its owner.)

1340
00:52:07,148 --> 00:52:08,978
How is the kitchen?

1341
00:52:11,148 --> 00:52:13,888
(Eddie asked the staff to find a kitchen for him.)

1342
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:15,957
(It's a restaurant in Suncheon.)

1343
00:52:15,958 --> 00:52:17,788
It's good. Everything is ready.

1344
00:52:18,728 --> 00:52:22,128
(Why did he come here specially on the last day?)

1345
00:52:22,928 --> 00:52:26,128
Being on this trip, I learned a lot about Korean food.

1346
00:52:26,598 --> 00:52:30,838
And the origins. We've been to three different regions...

1347
00:52:31,238 --> 00:52:34,738
and learned so many different foods from each region, so...

1348
00:52:36,038 --> 00:52:38,448
Some ideas are kind of floating in my head.

1349
00:52:39,708 --> 00:52:41,847
So I'm going to try and use these ingredients...

1350
00:52:41,848 --> 00:52:43,018
to make something new.

1351
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:47,818
Buckwheat noodles, dried pollack, doenjang, and soy sauce.

1352
00:52:48,218 --> 00:52:50,987
All of these things that we picked up along the way.

1353
00:52:50,988 --> 00:52:52,287
(Each ingredient reminds him of the people that he met.)

1354
00:52:52,288 --> 00:52:55,798
And they each have their own memory and their own experience.

1355
00:52:57,368 --> 00:52:59,928
I don't want to make the same meal that I had,

1356
00:53:00,028 --> 00:53:02,037
so I'm going to try and use these ingredients...

1357
00:53:02,038 --> 00:53:03,238
to make something new.

1358
00:53:05,438 --> 00:53:08,338
Friends who are going to eat something...

1359
00:53:08,838 --> 00:53:10,748
that they created and we created together.

1360
00:53:11,078 --> 00:53:12,808
I want to surprise them.

1361
00:53:14,778 --> 00:53:16,877
(The final dish the Country members will cook together)

1362
00:53:16,878 --> 00:53:19,248
(The real final dish)

1363
00:53:20,248 --> 00:53:21,717
(Eddie has it planned for the grand finale.)

1364
00:53:21,718 --> 00:53:23,838
(How will the 3 actors of the Country members react?)

1365
00:53:23,928 --> 00:53:24,928
(2 hours ago)

1366
00:53:24,929 --> 00:53:26,787
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1367
00:53:26,788 --> 00:53:28,227
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

1368
00:53:28,228 --> 00:53:29,958
- Good morning.
- Hi.

1369
00:53:30,228 --> 00:53:31,627
- How are you doing?
- Good morning.

1370
00:53:31,628 --> 00:53:33,097
Very well.

1371
00:53:33,098 --> 00:53:34,537
- Good last morning.
- How about you?

1372
00:53:34,538 --> 00:53:35,538
I'm good.

1373
00:53:36,638 --> 00:53:38,438
- We're making a lot of food today.
- This...

1374
00:53:39,638 --> 00:53:41,477
(A lot of food?)

1375
00:53:41,478 --> 00:53:43,078
So throughout the trip,

1376
00:53:43,438 --> 00:53:48,047
- we used a grandma's kitchen...
- Yes.

1377
00:53:48,048 --> 00:53:49,878
Or cooked outdoors.

1378
00:53:50,448 --> 00:53:54,158
But for our last cooking, we're going to have a real kitchen.

1379
00:53:54,818 --> 00:53:56,134
- A real restaurant.
- A real kitchen.

1380
00:53:56,158 --> 00:53:58,728
We're going to cook like real chefs today.

1381
00:53:59,688 --> 00:54:01,604
- We're going to cook.
- I'm looking forward to it.

1382
00:54:01,628 --> 00:54:02,628
You are ready.

1383
00:54:02,858 --> 00:54:05,098
- Yes, we're ready.
- We're chefs. You're not...

1384
00:54:05,198 --> 00:54:07,598
- cooks anymore. You're chefs.
- That's right.

1385
00:54:07,838 --> 00:54:11,468
- But...
- So I made it for you. This is...

1386
00:54:12,568 --> 00:54:15,278
(A notebook full of writings?)

1387
00:54:15,578 --> 00:54:16,607
- Ko A Sung.
- My gosh.

1388
00:54:16,608 --> 00:54:19,148
This is all you have to do.

1389
00:54:19,848 --> 00:54:22,978
(What is written on those papers?)

1390
00:54:23,210 --> 00:54:25,009
- Ko A Sung.
- My gosh.

1391
00:54:25,010 --> 00:54:26,910
This is all you have to do.

1392
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,480
(What is written on those papers?)

1393
00:54:30,690 --> 00:54:35,160
First, my name "Ko A Sung" was written big in Korean.

1394
00:54:36,020 --> 00:54:39,090
On the paper was a mix of Korean and English.

1395
00:54:39,490 --> 00:54:43,730
It was the chef's special recipe.

1396
00:54:45,730 --> 00:54:49,499
(Eddie wrote three recipes customized to each of them.)

1397
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:52,240
It felt strange because it looked like an award...

1398
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,670
and also a letter of appointment.

1399
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,280
My name was on top of a recipe for a dish I've never seen before.

1400
00:54:57,750 --> 00:55:00,450
I felt a huge sense of responsibility.

1401
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:04,090
It's been a long journey, and we've grown together.

1402
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:07,890
(The Country members grew slowly and bit by bit.)

1403
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:11,260
I wanted each person to be responsible for one dish.

1404
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:15,030
We're going to cook like chefs, not like cooks.

1405
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:18,799
(The recipes of their final dishes together...)

1406
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,700
(and heartfelt gifts from Eddie)

1407
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:24,970
I will help all of you. Today will be...

1408
00:55:25,970 --> 00:55:28,780
It will be a great meal. We're going to do something special.

1409
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,749
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

1410
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,880
He assigned us a recipe that would suit each of us.

1411
00:55:34,850 --> 00:55:37,079
Then to cook...

1412
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:38,090
Are you getting teary?

1413
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:39,419
I'm not getting teary.

1414
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:42,790
To cook, I need to fill up my stomach first.

1415
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,890
I was going to say I wanted to eat ramyeon.

1416
00:55:45,490 --> 00:55:47,690
(A completely unexpected thing to say in such a moment)

1417
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:50,870
To make "seven-layer rice," I need to eat.

1418
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,529
To do it on my own...

1419
00:55:52,530 --> 00:55:53,899
- I'll be quick.
- You were salivating.

1420
00:55:53,900 --> 00:55:54,900
- It was my saliva.
- It was your saliva.

1421
00:55:54,901 --> 00:55:56,039
Did you think it was my tears?

1422
00:55:56,040 --> 00:55:58,039
- Yes, so suddenly...
- The water is boiling.

1423
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,009
- So...
- You got impatient.

1424
00:56:00,010 --> 00:56:02,009
I need to eat this ramyeon.

1425
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,479
Let's be our usual selves.

1426
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,379
- Eat as usual.
- Jjajang ramyeon in the morning?

1427
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,210
I'll eat as usual.

1428
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:10,790
(Just like always, she prepares breakfast.)

1429
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,090
- Chef, I have a question.
- Yes?

1430
00:56:15,990 --> 00:56:17,120
Is this abalone?

1431
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,630
Yes, abalone.

1432
00:56:18,860 --> 00:56:21,059
Your Korean handwriting is so cute.

1433
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:23,800
But your English handwriting is so cool.

1434
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,939
I'm not good at reading English cursive handwriting.

1435
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:30,339
So I went through the process...

1436
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:33,070
of reading it thoroughly and relearning it.

1437
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:34,840
Is this "mugwort?"

1438
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,080
- Yes, mugwort.
- I see.

1439
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,280
Yes.

1440
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:40,409
- Mugwort.
- Okay.

1441
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:41,779
(A Sung asks many questions and checks it thoroughly.)

1442
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,780
- Mugwort.
- Mugwort. Okay.

1443
00:56:45,490 --> 00:56:47,960
(Focused)

1444
00:56:49,790 --> 00:56:51,459
What sauce was it?

1445
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,560
It's "beurre blanc," a French sauce.

1446
00:56:56,360 --> 00:56:57,799
I've never tried it.

1447
00:56:57,800 --> 00:57:00,360
(Quickly watching a video of the dish she's never cooked before)

1448
00:57:05,010 --> 00:57:08,579
I'll go first and get the kitchen ready.

1449
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:09,580
- Okay.
- Okay?

1450
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:10,849
Okay, thank you.

1451
00:57:10,850 --> 00:57:13,210
- Good luck. See you later.
- See you.

1452
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:15,920
- See you.
- See you.

1453
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:19,420
(That was how Eddie left the lodging.)

1454
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:26,060
(Si A is still cooking her morning ramyeon.)

1455
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,799
(She said she'd just eat 1 ramyeon.)

1456
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,930
(Beef)

1457
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:37,940
(We're sure she didn't mean what she said.)

1458
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:41,579
(Well-cooked beef...)

1459
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:45,180
(plus 2 servings of noodles)

1460
00:57:47,410 --> 00:57:50,420
(Lastly, add the jjajang sauce and mix it well.)

1461
00:57:52,950 --> 00:57:56,420
(Si A's real beef jjajang ramyeon is complete.)

1462
00:57:57,190 --> 00:57:58,589
Sit here in the center and eat.

1463
00:57:58,590 --> 00:57:59,660
Shall I?

1464
00:57:59,890 --> 00:58:01,329
You're not eating, right?

1465
00:58:01,330 --> 00:58:02,559
- No.
- Is it delicious?

1466
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:03,700
I haven't tried it yet.

1467
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,000
I'll try it now.

1468
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:08,770
- Is it good?
- Yes, Yo Han.

1469
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,370
It's so good.

1470
00:58:12,010 --> 00:58:14,380
(It looks like it can't taste bad.)

1471
00:58:14,510 --> 00:58:17,239
- Wait.
- Give me a bite. Just a bit.

1472
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,679
You're in your casual wear.

1473
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:20,879
It shouldn't splash on your clothes.

1474
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,650
Is it okay to have this for breakfast?

1475
00:58:23,250 --> 00:58:25,750
It's hot, right? You need to cool it down.

1476
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:28,219
(A lot)

1477
00:58:28,220 --> 00:58:29,419
I don't need to cool it down.

1478
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,859
Aren't you taking too big a bite?

1479
00:58:30,860 --> 00:58:32,220
(Shooting him down with the truth)

1480
00:58:32,830 --> 00:58:34,699
- Just a bite.
- How can you take so much...

1481
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,960
of Si A's?

1482
00:58:39,400 --> 00:58:40,629
(Gosh, it's good.)

1483
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,070
- Is it good?
- Yes.

1484
00:58:42,870 --> 00:58:44,209
(He brazenly takes another bite.)

1485
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:45,570
Si A, come quickly.

1486
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:48,480
I'm letting it cool down so I can have it with kimchi.

1487
00:58:49,610 --> 00:58:51,610
(You might end up with just kimchi.)

1488
00:58:51,880 --> 00:58:53,249
I can finish eating quickly.

1489
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:54,856
(She senses something off and returns quickly.)

1490
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:56,250
(Returning)

1491
00:58:57,180 --> 00:58:59,620
Yo Han, did you finish studying your recipe?

1492
00:59:00,590 --> 00:59:02,890
- I think I can just do it.
- I'm studying it now.

1493
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:04,229
I'll go in and take a look.

1494
00:59:04,230 --> 00:59:05,429
Are we cooking here?

1495
00:59:05,430 --> 00:59:06,990
- No, later at the restaurant.
- I see.

1496
00:59:07,030 --> 00:59:08,800
Like this... Okay.

1497
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,400
I'm done.

1498
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,400
(The plate feels light.)

1499
00:59:13,070 --> 00:59:14,939
It's so cute and precious.

1500
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:17,380
(A Sung passes on morning ramyeon and focuses on the recipe.)

1501
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,809
(Eddie's handwritten recipe is very precious.)

1502
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:22,340
Really though,

1503
00:59:22,580 --> 00:59:25,009
- I'm looking forward to it so much.
- Me too.

1504
00:59:25,010 --> 00:59:26,209
- I wonder how it will turn out.
- I can't imagine...

1505
00:59:26,210 --> 00:59:27,410
how your dish will turn out.

1506
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,519
Actually, I can't either.

1507
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:32,419
It looks like a floor plan.

1508
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:33,580
(It looks like a house plan.)

1509
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,759
It's like a layout of a house...

1510
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:37,729
- for the interior design.
- This house was built this way.

1511
00:59:37,730 --> 00:59:38,790
I agree.

1512
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:41,529
Yo Han's recipe is quite hard.

1513
00:59:41,530 --> 00:59:43,459
When you look at it,

1514
00:59:43,460 --> 00:59:46,400
- it's nothing we've seen before.
- Look.

1515
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:47,869
I need to make a sauce for eel with gochujang,

1516
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:49,139
but there is no recipe for the sauce.

1517
00:59:49,140 --> 00:59:50,899
(Yo Han's recipe has a lot of details omitted.)

1518
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,040
Make gochujang, and...

1519
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:56,039
(Byun Yo Han, buckwheat noodles, tuna, eel, gochujang sauce)

1520
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:58,110
It was hard to make out the words.

1521
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,920
"Tuna," "gochujang,"

1522
01:00:04,850 --> 01:00:06,090
"slice?"

1523
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:08,120
"Sauce."

1524
01:00:08,320 --> 01:00:10,200
But I don't know what sauce he is referring to.

1525
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:12,790
I think even those...

1526
01:00:13,290 --> 01:00:14,600
were part of his plan.

1527
01:00:15,230 --> 01:00:18,700
(Is it Eddie's playful plan for him to study more?)

1528
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:23,170
(Eddie is quickly preparing the ingredients.)

1529
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:29,080
(He puts in a lot more effort compared to all the other times.)

1530
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:34,880
(What food will the Country members cook last for their trip?)

1531
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:37,050
I think we're here.

1532
01:00:39,250 --> 01:00:41,090
"Mouth, Water, and Space."

1533
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:44,889
(They enter the restaurant where Eddie is waiting for them.)

1534
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:46,189
Chef.

1535
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:47,730
(Look at this place.)

1536
01:00:48,130 --> 01:00:50,500
(Are we going to cook here?)

1537
01:00:51,030 --> 01:00:52,929
(You guys are here.)

1538
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:54,100
Welcome.

1539
01:00:54,740 --> 01:00:56,970
- Hello.
- How are you? I already started.

1540
01:00:58,040 --> 01:00:59,310
Really?

1541
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,809
(Very charismatic)

1542
01:01:01,810 --> 01:01:04,050
(After greeting them briefly, Eddie focuses on cooking.)

1543
01:01:05,580 --> 01:01:07,720
(He shows his true self as a chef.)

1544
01:01:08,250 --> 01:01:10,780
Before everyone started cooking,

1545
01:01:11,420 --> 01:01:14,759
I saw him in his chef uniform and an apron.

1546
01:01:14,760 --> 01:01:17,320
I could feel the years of experience he had.

1547
01:01:17,360 --> 01:01:21,060
For a moment, I thought, "Right, he is a chef."

1548
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:23,230
He looked really cool.

1549
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:24,999
When I walked into the restaurant...

1550
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,670
and saw him there as a chef,

1551
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:30,200
I felt unusually tense.

1552
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:33,110
Let's get started.

1553
01:01:34,610 --> 01:01:36,739
(Washing hands)

1554
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,510
(Putting on an apron)

1555
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:40,810
Okay.

1556
01:01:40,811 --> 01:01:41,850
(They're ready.)

1557
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,989
Okay. Bring your papers.

1558
01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:46,120
(I almost forgot my recipe.)

1559
01:01:46,220 --> 01:01:49,189
- A Sung, I have your station here.
- All right.

1560
01:01:49,190 --> 01:01:50,759
You will be making...

1561
01:01:50,760 --> 01:01:52,289
- "mugwort dumpling." - Cool.

1562
01:01:52,290 --> 01:01:54,929
The first thing we're going to start with is...

1563
01:01:54,930 --> 01:01:57,300
- Mix. Okay.
- making the dough, okay?

1564
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:00,699
We ate ice cream in Yeosu...

1565
01:02:00,700 --> 01:02:01,939
which was made with mugwort.

1566
01:02:01,940 --> 01:02:03,839
(Eddie got the inspiration from the mugwort ice cream in Yeosu.)

1567
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,010
It just got me to think, "If you can make mugwort ice cream,"

1568
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,140
"what else can you make with mugwort?"

1569
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:13,179
And I thought, "Why not we make mugwort dumplings?"

1570
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,249
(Ko A Sung: Makgeolli, butter sauce, scallop, abalone)

1571
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:16,050
(mugwort dumplings, shrimp, scallop, abalone)

1572
01:02:16,350 --> 01:02:18,990
(A Sung is going to make mugwort dumplings today.)

1573
01:02:19,690 --> 01:02:21,089
(Mugwort dumpling)

1574
01:02:21,090 --> 01:02:22,190
Mugwort.

1575
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,560
Mugwort that we used before.

1576
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:27,230
(How to mix the powder?)

1577
01:02:28,130 --> 01:02:30,430
(A Sung recalls the recipe she learned in advance.)

1578
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:33,230
(She breaks an egg immediately!)

1579
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:36,699
(Mugwort dumpling wrapper recipe 2:)

1580
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,510
(Mix flour, mugwort powder, and 2 eggs.)

1581
01:02:39,210 --> 01:02:40,969
We'll use this a little.

1582
01:02:40,970 --> 01:02:42,509
Thank you.

1583
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:44,309
(Mugwort dumpling wrapper recipe 3: Add salt to the dough.)

1584
01:02:44,310 --> 01:02:47,180
Then mix it, and then you need water, right?

1585
01:02:51,290 --> 01:02:53,950
(Now, knead the dough as hard as you can.)

1586
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:59,360
For you...

1587
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:02,530
For the layers, I'm going to use leaf mustard kimchi.

1588
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:04,999
- And then bracken.
- Yes.

1589
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,070
- And then chwinamul.
- Chwinamul.

1590
01:03:08,900 --> 01:03:11,669
I think, coming from this trip,

1591
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:15,309
I found a new appreciation for seasoned vegetables...

1592
01:03:15,310 --> 01:03:17,909
and how different it is and how delicate...

1593
01:03:17,910 --> 01:03:19,809
and how much care gets put into it.

1594
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:20,986
(Seasoned vegetables master, Kwon Young Won from Episode 3)

1595
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:24,520
I definitely found a new love for seasoned vegetables.

1596
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:27,250
And this galbijjim is going.

1597
01:03:27,390 --> 01:03:28,989
- Yes.
- It's almost ready.

1598
01:03:28,990 --> 01:03:30,019
Yes, my gosh.

1599
01:03:30,020 --> 01:03:31,590
(Let us introduce this galbijjim.)

1600
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,230
(Due to the lack of time, Eddie cooked it in advance.)

1601
01:03:36,430 --> 01:03:38,270
(The key point of the taste...)

1602
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:40,970
(is this soy sauce!)

1603
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:42,639
Smell the soy sauce.

1604
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,810
(Episode 6, Meju Village, Yecheon)

1605
01:03:46,670 --> 01:03:48,209
(He used the precious soy sauce...)

1606
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:49,970
(he got from the Meju Village, Mount Hakga.)

1607
01:03:50,680 --> 01:03:52,950
(Galbijjim full of Yecheon's energy)

1608
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:55,949
(Si A's menu which has Jeongseon, Yeosu, and Yecheon)

1609
01:03:55,950 --> 01:03:58,989
So I really wanted to do all the layers...

1610
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:01,559
of seasoned vegetables, kimchi, and galbijjim.

1611
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:02,789
(Rice, seasoned vegetables, rice, leaf mustard kimchi, galbijjim)

1612
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:04,310
(Sauce is butter and galbijjim broth.)

1613
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,660
(It is a seven-layer cake made with rice.)

1614
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,399
So for now, if you take sesame oil and just...

1615
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:14,640
- rub everything, it'll be nice.
- Okay.

1616
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:18,310
We shouldn't smile now, should we?

1617
01:04:18,670 --> 01:04:20,409
I guess we can smile a bit.

1618
01:04:20,410 --> 01:04:21,540
(Smiling)

1619
01:04:21,810 --> 01:04:24,110
(A pot where she'll layer the cake)

1620
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:26,850
(Apply sesame oil thoroughly so the rice doesn't stick on it.)

1621
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:30,380
(She finishes coating it with sesame oil!)

1622
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:33,389
- All right.
- What about me?

1623
01:04:33,390 --> 01:04:34,760
- Mr. Yo Han.
- Yes.

1624
01:04:34,820 --> 01:04:36,589
So the first thing we're going to do...

1625
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:38,430
- This is the noodles.
- Yes.

1626
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:42,300
I think to me, I'll think of...

1627
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,969
Gangwon Province and buckwheat noodles.

1628
01:04:44,970 --> 01:04:47,099
That was probably...

1629
01:04:47,100 --> 01:04:49,599
the best meal that I had on this trip.

1630
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,610
So it's kind of making my own twist on her...

1631
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:55,210
noodle dish.

1632
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:57,900
(Gochujang strawberry sauce, tuna, fried eel, buckwheat noodles)

1633
01:04:58,680 --> 01:05:00,810
(Yo Han's dish, buckwheat noodles)

1634
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:03,319
We're going to make gochujang sauce.

1635
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:04,650
So here's gochujang.

1636
01:05:04,690 --> 01:05:07,790
(Gochujang strawberry sauce)

1637
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,019
- I have some pear...
- Yes.

1638
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:11,389
- that I pureed.
- Yes.

1639
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:14,630
And then I also want to put in some strawberries...

1640
01:05:15,030 --> 01:05:17,560
- from Andong.
- Strawberries and pear.

1641
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,499
You'll probably say, "I don't want the seeds."

1642
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,239
So you probably just want to do...

1643
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:23,469
(Strain the stir-fried strawberries using the sieve.)

1644
01:05:23,470 --> 01:05:25,710
This, and maybe...

1645
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:27,280
(Press it down using your strength.)

1646
01:05:29,540 --> 01:05:31,040
(Pouting in concentration)

1647
01:05:31,110 --> 01:05:33,080
- Like this?
- Yes.

1648
01:05:34,080 --> 01:05:36,420
And the pureed pear.

1649
01:05:37,850 --> 01:05:39,290
- You do the same thing.
- Okay.

1650
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:43,219
Judging from strawberries and pears,

1651
01:05:43,220 --> 01:05:45,460
the sauce is going to be sweet.

1652
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,029
So... All that in there.

1653
01:05:48,030 --> 01:05:49,730
- Everything?
- Yes.

1654
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:52,469
(Strawberries, pears, and gochujang. What kind of sauce will they make?)

1655
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:53,599
This...

1656
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,239
And vinegar.

1657
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:56,440
Add vinegar.

1658
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:57,800
- "Vinegar." - Okay.

1659
01:05:58,340 --> 01:05:59,439
(Sour vinegar)

1660
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:01,070
- Here.
- Sugar and vinegar.

1661
01:06:01,810 --> 01:06:03,410
- Sesame oil.
- Sesame oil.

1662
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,409
Sweet and sour.

1663
01:06:06,410 --> 01:06:07,890
(Mix the three flavors harmoniously.)

1664
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:10,580
It should be sweet.

1665
01:06:11,080 --> 01:06:12,589
- It's pretty good.
- It's delicious.

1666
01:06:12,590 --> 01:06:14,589
- What do you think? Good.
- I like it.

1667
01:06:14,590 --> 01:06:15,660
All right.

1668
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,589
This is the taste he was going for.

1669
01:06:17,590 --> 01:06:19,706
(Gochujang strawberry sauce for buckwheat noodles is complete.)

1670
01:06:19,730 --> 01:06:20,759
Okay.

1671
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,199
(Today's dishes were delegated to the Country members.)

1672
01:06:22,200 --> 01:06:25,269
Kyun, what did you base it on...

1673
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:28,200
when you assigned the dishes to us?

1674
01:06:28,770 --> 01:06:31,570
Because Si A is easy.

1675
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,109
(I'm easy?)

1676
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:35,240
You like big food.

1677
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:37,109
- She's a big eater.
- So I gave you...

1678
01:06:37,110 --> 01:06:38,510
the biggest portion of food.

1679
01:06:38,580 --> 01:06:39,849
For you...

1680
01:06:39,850 --> 01:06:41,226
(Why did he give Yo Han buckwheat noodles?)

1681
01:06:41,250 --> 01:06:43,920
I'm expecting a lot from you.

1682
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:46,990
(An unexpected reply)

1683
01:06:47,290 --> 01:06:48,819
Your sauce...

1684
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,219
- and your unique touch on food.
- Okay.

1685
01:06:51,220 --> 01:06:53,989
- I expect you to give me...
- Thank you.

1686
01:06:53,990 --> 01:06:55,800
- the right flavor.
- Okay.

1687
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,359
(Was I an ace?)

1688
01:06:57,360 --> 01:06:58,700
I feel pressured to perform well.

1689
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,170
What about me?

1690
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,940
I gave you the hardest.

1691
01:07:05,270 --> 01:07:06,270
Because...

1692
01:07:06,271 --> 01:07:08,479
Shush. You are the best.

1693
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:09,780
So I gave you the hardest.

1694
01:07:09,880 --> 01:07:11,239
(The true ace of the Country members)

1695
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:12,450
(He is a fake ace.)

1696
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:14,649
She's a really good chef.

1697
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:18,419
And she has a really delicate touch when it comes to food.

1698
01:07:18,420 --> 01:07:22,719
So the dumpling is something you really have to focus hard on.

1699
01:07:22,720 --> 01:07:24,360
And I think she'll be good at that.

1700
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,030
This dumpling is so thin.

1701
01:07:29,530 --> 01:07:32,370
(A Sung is done with kneading and now she makes dumpling skin.)

1702
01:07:33,170 --> 01:07:34,669
I'll make it very thin.

1703
01:07:34,670 --> 01:07:35,670
(I'll make it thin.)

1704
01:07:36,140 --> 01:07:39,169
This is a very serious one.

1705
01:07:39,170 --> 01:07:42,409
If you make it wrong, the dumpling will not be good.

1706
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,640
- I believe in you.
- All right.

1707
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:48,950
I'll make you proud of it.

1708
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:53,290
I want to make it like mulnaengmyeon.

1709
01:07:53,720 --> 01:07:55,719
- I want to make broth.
- I see.

1710
01:07:55,720 --> 01:07:57,819
And I'll use this for the broth.

1711
01:07:57,820 --> 01:07:59,230
- Dried pollack, right?
- Yes.

1712
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:02,499
Chef, are the dried pollacks what we received...

1713
01:08:02,500 --> 01:08:03,660
- in Gangwon Province?
- Yes.

1714
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,329
It was in the trailer the whole time.

1715
01:08:06,330 --> 01:08:07,829
(The key ingredient of the broth, dried pollack)

1716
01:08:07,830 --> 01:08:09,840
It has a very delicate flavor.

1717
01:08:10,440 --> 01:08:12,670
So it made me think of mulnaengmyeon.

1718
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:16,440
So we made a really quick, easy, fast...

1719
01:08:16,610 --> 01:08:18,550
broth with the dried pollack.

1720
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:21,380
But I don't want to boil for a long time. Just a very short time.

1721
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:23,079
- To just get a little flavor, - Yes.

1722
01:08:23,080 --> 01:08:24,119
- strain it, - Yes.

1723
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:26,089
- and then make it really cold.
- I see.

1724
01:08:26,090 --> 01:08:27,319
- So...
- I'll boil it.

1725
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:28,320
Okay.

1726
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:30,590
- I can boil it for a short time.
- Just a little bit.

1727
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,559
(Can I just put dried pollack into water?)

1728
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:33,860
All right.

1729
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:37,099
Kyun, then I'll boil water first,

1730
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:39,300
and put this in for a short time, right?

1731
01:08:39,700 --> 01:08:40,906
- For 5 minutes.
- For 5 minutes.

1732
01:08:40,930 --> 01:08:42,599
But we have no ginger.

1733
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:43,900
We have ginger here.

1734
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:45,709
- Shall I add this now?
- Yes.

1735
01:08:45,710 --> 01:08:47,410
Kyun, shall I put all of these?

1736
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:49,479
It's two.

1737
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:51,880
(A question follows every move.)

1738
01:08:52,580 --> 01:08:53,649
- Kyun.
- Yes.

1739
01:08:53,650 --> 01:08:54,750
I can cut it this big.

1740
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,350
One whole stock. Yes.

1741
01:08:57,880 --> 01:08:59,690
Except for this one, cut everything.

1742
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:03,690
(The fake ace player got the broth for buckwheat noodles.)

1743
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:05,789
(Dried pollack broth recipe)

1744
01:09:05,790 --> 01:09:07,029
(Add hand-torn dried pollack and radish to the boiling water.)

1745
01:09:07,030 --> 01:09:08,129
(Boil for 5 minutes.)

1746
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:09,999
It seems to be a tough task for me.

1747
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,200
(Good at self-objectification)

1748
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,500
It seems to be a tough task.

1749
01:09:14,130 --> 01:09:15,340
That's the easy one.

1750
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:18,539
(Hang in there, Yo Han.)

1751
01:09:18,540 --> 01:09:20,039
Marinade for galbi.

1752
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:21,680
(Meanwhile, how is Si A's cooking going?)

1753
01:09:22,310 --> 01:09:24,139
Chef, for galbi,

1754
01:09:24,140 --> 01:09:26,179
do I use only the galbi meat, not the vegetables in galbi?

1755
01:09:26,180 --> 01:09:27,379
- Just galbi.
- I see.

1756
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:29,150
- Taste it. It's perfect.
- Okay.

1757
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:31,149
All right.

1758
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:33,350
(Foodie Si A is most confident in eating.)

1759
01:09:33,690 --> 01:09:34,859
(Eating only the galbi meat)

1760
01:09:34,860 --> 01:09:37,300
(She feels sweet and strong marinate the moment she eats it.)

1761
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:41,290
(Galbijjim itself is already an amazing dish.)

1762
01:09:42,330 --> 01:09:44,500
(Now, shall I begin my work?)

1763
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,130
(Si A tears galbi.)

1764
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:50,669
Now that I tear galbi,

1765
01:09:50,670 --> 01:09:52,570
it looks like jangjorim.

1766
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:57,009
(Checking Eddie's recipe often)

1767
01:09:57,010 --> 01:09:58,309
(Galbijjim)

1768
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:00,049
If we're ready to do the beef, let's layer.

1769
01:10:00,050 --> 01:10:01,449
(If the meat is ready, now it's time to layer the cake.)

1770
01:10:01,450 --> 01:10:03,750
- So, first layer.
- Rice.

1771
01:10:04,050 --> 01:10:05,889
And I want to do it very thin.

1772
01:10:05,890 --> 01:10:06,890
- Thin?
- Yes.

1773
01:10:06,891 --> 01:10:08,519
It's going to be too much.

1774
01:10:08,520 --> 01:10:09,520
Okay.

1775
01:10:09,521 --> 01:10:12,589
So you remember, when you flip it over, this is going to be the top.

1776
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:14,629
- That's right. It's the opposite - After you do it... Yes.

1777
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:15,660
You're right.

1778
01:10:16,430 --> 01:10:18,269
So you can make it nice and flat.

1779
01:10:18,270 --> 01:10:19,700
- All right.
- All right.

1780
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:21,540
Layer two,

1781
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,346
- seasoned vegetables.
- Seasoned vegetables.

1782
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:24,939
You know when I did this...

1783
01:10:24,940 --> 01:10:28,040
Do you remember when we went to that lady's house,

1784
01:10:28,170 --> 01:10:30,380
and she made rice with seasoned vegetables?

1785
01:10:30,840 --> 01:10:32,579
- Yes.
- She made seasoned vegetables.

1786
01:10:32,580 --> 01:10:34,109
- You mean thistle rice.
- Right.

1787
01:10:34,110 --> 01:10:36,619
I came up with this idea because I knew it.

1788
01:10:36,620 --> 01:10:38,596
(Ms. Kwon Young Won inspired him to create the recipe!)

1789
01:10:38,620 --> 01:10:41,520
That has always been in my mind the whole trip.

1790
01:10:41,990 --> 01:10:44,219
She put the seasoned vegetables inside the rice maker...

1791
01:10:44,220 --> 01:10:45,690
and then made rice with it.

1792
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:48,499
(The seasoned vegetable master cooked rice...)

1793
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,699
(by layering thistle and rice.)

1794
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:52,069
So today, I thought, "Okay,"

1795
01:10:52,070 --> 01:10:55,199
"I want to do something like that, where we put rice..."

1796
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:56,870
"and seasoned vegetables together."

1797
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,870
And then I got to think, "Why don't we just layer the whole thing?"

1798
01:11:01,170 --> 01:11:03,910
To me, it's a very special dish.

1799
01:11:04,780 --> 01:11:05,850
I see.

1800
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:08,280
Thistle rice inspired you.

1801
01:11:08,350 --> 01:11:11,150
My whole trip,

1802
01:11:11,420 --> 01:11:13,649
the ideas I got from it were all mixed together.

1803
01:11:13,650 --> 01:11:14,849
I see.

1804
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:16,819
- The ideas are fermented.
- Yes.

1805
01:11:16,820 --> 01:11:17,820
Yes.

1806
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,029
(The seasoned vegetables in Jeongseon inspired...)

1807
01:11:20,030 --> 01:11:21,760
(Si A's 7-layer rice cake.)

1808
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:24,729
Chef, I'm layering the fourth floor now.

1809
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:25,770
Oh, my goodness.

1810
01:11:26,230 --> 01:11:29,439
(The final dishes to show the fruits of the ingredient-exploring trip!)

1811
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:31,139
Is the dumpling place going all right over there?

1812
01:11:31,140 --> 01:11:33,239
- Yes, things are going great.
- I see.

1813
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,040
- I have a huge expectation.
- Thank you.

1814
01:11:36,580 --> 01:11:37,839
How is your galbijjim going?

1815
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:39,510
I'm on the fourth layer now.

1816
01:11:40,450 --> 01:11:42,349
- I have three more layers to go.
- When are you completing it?

1817
01:11:42,350 --> 01:11:43,449
- Excuse me?
- How long, until completion?

1818
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:45,989
I need some more time until completion.

1819
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:47,019
I see.

1820
01:11:47,020 --> 01:11:49,290
Wait. Are you joking around? Is that a joke?

1821
01:11:49,460 --> 01:11:51,789
(A chef mode)

1822
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:52,790
No.

1823
01:11:53,630 --> 01:11:55,559
I'm sorry.

1824
01:11:55,560 --> 01:11:57,760
That sounded like a joke to me.

1825
01:11:57,860 --> 01:12:01,070
You understand Korean so well at a moment like this.

1826
01:12:01,770 --> 01:12:03,099
I've been working seriously.

1827
01:12:03,100 --> 01:12:04,616
(Yo Han focused on cooking without saying anything.)

1828
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,210
(A strict man in the kitchen)

1829
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:11,110
(Focusing again)

1830
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:12,509
Six.

1831
01:12:12,510 --> 01:12:13,579
(Making round dumpling skins...)

1832
01:12:13,580 --> 01:12:14,580
Eight.

1833
01:12:14,581 --> 01:12:15,850
(by thinly spreading the dough)

1834
01:12:16,580 --> 01:12:18,420
The dumpling skins are finished.

1835
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:19,550
Okay.

1836
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:21,349
I'm going to make the dumpling filling.

1837
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:22,389
- Okay.
- And then,

1838
01:12:22,390 --> 01:12:25,030
I'm going to put abalone in the dumplings.

1839
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,859
- For the dumpling filling?
- Yes.

1840
01:12:26,860 --> 01:12:27,959
- Great.
- Do you like that?

1841
01:12:27,960 --> 01:12:28,960
Yes.

1842
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:31,330
- Abalone dumplings.
- It sounds great.

1843
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:33,570
We've had so much fresh seafood,

1844
01:12:34,470 --> 01:12:38,570
witnessing what the haenyeos were doing.

1845
01:12:40,010 --> 01:12:41,739
That's a really strong memory.

1846
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:44,300
(The strong memory made him to choose abalone as an ingredient.)

1847
01:12:46,180 --> 01:12:49,280
(Starting to make the dumpling filling with seafood)

1848
01:12:49,980 --> 01:12:52,189
(Recipe for abalone dumpling)

1849
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:53,549
(Cut chives, shrimps, scallops, and abalone...)

1850
01:12:53,550 --> 01:12:55,120
(into the same size.)

1851
01:13:00,490 --> 01:13:03,030
(I'm from the Yeosu sea!)

1852
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:06,470
(Lemon to add freshness is a must.)

1853
01:13:07,070 --> 01:13:09,670
(Season with salt...)

1854
01:13:10,470 --> 01:13:13,310
(and mix together.)

1855
01:13:13,540 --> 01:13:15,240
You know, there's tofu here.

1856
01:13:15,510 --> 01:13:16,610
- Tofu.
- Yes.

1857
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:17,939
My tofu.

1858
01:13:17,940 --> 01:13:20,510
(Crush tofu and mix together.)

1859
01:13:20,750 --> 01:13:22,050
Here's your dumpling filling.

1860
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:23,720
- Already done?
- Yes.

1861
01:13:25,090 --> 01:13:28,120
(A Sung starts to make dumplings!)

1862
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:32,030
(Put the right amount of filling on the dumpling skin.)

1863
01:13:32,260 --> 01:13:34,630
If you spread water like this...

1864
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,359
It sticks together better.

1865
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:37,499
(Spread water on the rim of the dumpling skin.)

1866
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,529
Fold it.

1867
01:13:38,530 --> 01:13:40,600
(A Sung is meticulous.)

1868
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,299
- Okay. Are you good?
- Yes.

1869
01:13:42,300 --> 01:13:43,540
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1870
01:13:44,940 --> 01:13:46,370
What's the next thing on your list?

1871
01:13:47,110 --> 01:13:49,139
- Tuna and eel.
- Yes, tuna.

1872
01:13:49,140 --> 01:13:51,680
- Tuna is here.
- I'll take it out first. It's tuna.

1873
01:13:52,150 --> 01:13:53,680
It's real tuna.

1874
01:13:53,850 --> 01:13:55,449
Do you think I'd use a fake one?

1875
01:13:55,450 --> 01:13:57,379
I thought it was canned tuna.

1876
01:13:57,380 --> 01:13:58,419
No.

1877
01:13:58,420 --> 01:13:59,619
It's real tuna.

1878
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:01,449
- It looks good.
- Into what size shall I cut it?

1879
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:03,160
We're going to make little squares.

1880
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,560
To cubes. Okay.

1881
01:14:04,690 --> 01:14:06,429
Can you make an example?

1882
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:07,960
Then I'll do the same.

1883
01:14:08,090 --> 01:14:09,759
- Do you see the lines?
- Yes.

1884
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,500
- I'll try following the lines.
- Yes.

1885
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:14,669
(Eddie demonstrates preparing tuna.)

1886
01:14:14,670 --> 01:14:16,040
Then when you come here...

1887
01:14:16,670 --> 01:14:18,869
you're going to do a bite-size.

1888
01:14:18,870 --> 01:14:20,440
- Into a bite-size.
- Yes.

1889
01:14:20,770 --> 01:14:22,579
Into one bite, like this.

1890
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:23,580
I got it.

1891
01:14:23,581 --> 01:14:26,379
You came up with the tuna idea from the yukhoe buckwheat noodles?

1892
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:28,410
- Yes.
- I thought so.

1893
01:14:29,020 --> 01:14:30,020
From what?

1894
01:14:30,021 --> 01:14:31,949
We had the yukhoe buckwheat noodles...

1895
01:14:31,950 --> 01:14:33,219
in Gangwon Province.

1896
01:14:33,220 --> 01:14:34,590
I don't think I had it.

1897
01:14:35,160 --> 01:14:36,960
When we were working hard,

1898
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,690
Yo Han was having fun in Seoul.

1899
01:14:39,960 --> 01:14:42,359
He was just having fun.

1900
01:14:42,360 --> 01:14:45,600
This is your punishment, not having buckwheat noodles.

1901
01:14:46,200 --> 01:14:48,800
(The buckwheat noodles dish was a punishment for him.)

1902
01:14:49,070 --> 01:14:50,940
It was really good.

1903
01:14:51,700 --> 01:14:55,510
Yo Han actually didn't have...

1904
01:14:55,580 --> 01:14:58,549
the beautiful meal at the buckwheat noodles place.

1905
01:14:58,550 --> 01:15:00,949
So I actually wanted him to feel it,

1906
01:15:00,950 --> 01:15:02,949
because he missed a whole meal.

1907
01:15:02,950 --> 01:15:04,480
So I wanted him to actually feel...

1908
01:15:04,950 --> 01:15:08,560
making a dish somewhat close to what we had there.

1909
01:15:09,860 --> 01:15:11,960
(I will recreate the taste with tuna, not yukhoe!)

1910
01:15:13,230 --> 01:15:15,029
(Recipe for buckwheat noodles)

1911
01:15:15,030 --> 01:15:17,099
(Cut tuna into bite-sized pieces and put them in a bowl.)

1912
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:19,770
Perfect. And what you're going to do is, to tuna,

1913
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,599
- you add a little gochujang.
- It looks good.

1914
01:15:22,600 --> 01:15:24,040
That's what I expected.

1915
01:15:24,270 --> 01:15:25,340
I...

1916
01:15:25,740 --> 01:15:27,869
- It looks so good.
- We'll marinade it.

1917
01:15:27,870 --> 01:15:29,539
(The sauce adds color to tuna.)

1918
01:15:29,540 --> 01:15:32,250
The tuna tastes bland,

1919
01:15:32,450 --> 01:15:34,149
- so I'll add a bit of salt.
- Okay.

01:15:34,150 --> 01:15:35,249
(Recipe for buckwheat noodles)

1921
01:15:35,250 --> 01:15:36,279
All right.

1922
01:15:36,280 --> 01:15:37,649
(Add gochujang strawberry sauce to tuna...)

1923
01:15:37,650 --> 01:15:39,049
(and season with salt.)

1924
01:15:39,050 --> 01:15:40,949
Kyun, I set this first.

1925
01:15:40,950 --> 01:15:42,059
(What's next?)

1926
01:15:42,060 --> 01:15:43,719
- Please take a look at it.
- Okay.

1927
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:44,990
- So this one?
- Look.

1928
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:46,289
(Sauce from the trailer)

1929
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:47,330
I see.

1930
01:15:47,630 --> 01:15:49,059
Do you remember...

1931
01:15:49,060 --> 01:15:50,529
- Jjimdak.
- Jjimdak.

1932
01:15:50,530 --> 01:15:51,759
- Andong jjimdak.
- I see.

1933
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:53,169
Do you remember we stole the sauce from...

1934
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:55,010
- It's that sauce.
- the Andong jjimdak place.

1935
01:15:57,070 --> 01:15:59,469
Right. The jjimdak place owner gave us the sauce.

1936
01:15:59,470 --> 01:16:01,980
(The soy sauce from Andong jjimdak place)

1937
01:16:04,110 --> 01:16:05,579
(Recipe for buckwheat noodles)

1938
01:16:05,580 --> 01:16:07,109
(Add Andong jjimdak sauce to the eel...)

1939
01:16:07,110 --> 01:16:08,680
(and mix together.)

1940
01:16:10,250 --> 01:16:11,819
(Pan-fry the eel mixed with sauce.)

1941
01:16:11,820 --> 01:16:13,050
It makes you strong.

1942
01:16:13,850 --> 01:16:15,189
You cook it, and you're ready.

1943
01:16:15,190 --> 01:16:16,319
(It makes...)

1944
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,690
(your mouth water.)

1945
01:16:19,130 --> 01:16:21,290
(Adding Andong jjimdak sauce to the eel!)

1946
01:16:22,300 --> 01:16:24,499
(Buckwheat noodles, tuna, and eel)

1947
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:26,500
(How would the combination taste?)

1948
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:30,539
(Si A is finishing the 7-layer rice cake.)

1949
01:16:30,540 --> 01:16:32,439
On the seventh layer... Okay.

1950
01:16:32,440 --> 01:16:33,610
(It's time to add galbijjim.)

1951
01:16:34,340 --> 01:16:35,779
A lot of galbi.

1952
01:16:35,780 --> 01:16:36,839
(Put shredded galbi meat on rice.)

1953
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:38,380
A lot of galbi.

1954
01:16:39,210 --> 01:16:41,180
(A lot of galbi)

1955
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:46,919
(Adding)

1956
01:16:46,920 --> 01:16:47,920
(Adding again)

1957
01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,760
(Si A is a big player.)

1958
01:16:52,430 --> 01:16:53,729
(Rice, chwinamul, rice, leat mustard kimchi, )

1959
01:16:53,730 --> 01:16:54,929
(rice, galbijjim, and rice)

1960
01:16:54,930 --> 01:16:58,829
(Si A's rice cake is almost completed.)

1961
01:16:58,830 --> 01:16:59,970
How is your rice looking?

1962
01:17:00,730 --> 01:17:02,139
It's almost done now.

1963
01:17:02,140 --> 01:17:03,140
So,

1964
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:04,940
we have no oven here.

1965
01:17:05,070 --> 01:17:06,509
- We have no oven.
- No.

1966
01:17:06,510 --> 01:17:08,679
So, we're going to do it here.

1967
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,109
We'll just...

1968
01:17:10,110 --> 01:17:11,479
As it is. I see.

1969
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:13,186
(Eddie puts the rice cake pot on the burner.)

1970
01:17:13,210 --> 01:17:15,380
So here, we're going to...

1971
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:18,790
smell when nurungji happens.

1972
01:17:19,250 --> 01:17:20,419
You're going to smell it.

1973
01:17:20,420 --> 01:17:21,649
But I'm going to try...

1974
01:17:21,650 --> 01:17:22,960
- putting a lid here.
- Okay.

1975
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:24,800
Because I want to get everything hot.

1976
01:17:24,920 --> 01:17:26,859
- You mean like hot sotbap?
- Yes.

1977
01:17:26,860 --> 01:17:28,529
- Yes.
- The thing that I cooked last time.

1978
01:17:28,530 --> 01:17:30,360
- Like mushroom sotbap?
- Yes.

1979
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:32,369
(Still making dumplings)

1980
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:34,200
(Nervous)

1981
01:17:34,830 --> 01:17:36,499
- I'm too late, right?
- Not at all.

1982
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:37,699
- It's okay?
- This is...

1983
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:40,240
- Yes?
- Once it's done, we just boil it...

1984
01:17:40,940 --> 01:17:42,610
We can make the sauce very fast.

1985
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,010
What's important guys... Remember.

1986
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:51,020
The 1, 2, and 3. Things should come out at the same time.

1987
01:17:51,780 --> 01:17:53,689
- Around the same time?
- That's it.

1988
01:17:53,690 --> 01:17:54,819
That's really important...

1989
01:17:54,820 --> 01:17:56,290
when we think about a restaurant.

1990
01:17:56,960 --> 01:17:58,790
If we do this too early,

1991
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:00,159
- it's going to get cold and dry.
- Yes.

1992
01:18:00,160 --> 01:18:01,229
The rice...

1993
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:02,829
So, everything should come out at the same time.

1994
01:18:02,830 --> 01:18:03,830
- Yes, Chef.
- Oh, I see.

1995
01:18:03,831 --> 01:18:06,829
So I timed everything so that when you are done,

1996
01:18:06,830 --> 01:18:09,000
everything will be done at the same time.

1997
01:18:09,370 --> 01:18:10,370
Yes, Chef.

1998
01:18:11,370 --> 01:18:13,470
Oh, the dumplings look so good.

1999
01:18:13,970 --> 01:18:15,740
- Thank you.
- Okay.

2000
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:17,579
- All at the same time.
- Okay.

2001
01:18:17,580 --> 01:18:18,580
(Time to steam dumplings)

2002
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:23,749
- For 3 or 4 minutes in the water.
- Oh, really?

2003
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:27,850
Yes, once dumplings float, we count for 30 seconds.

2004
01:18:27,950 --> 01:18:29,390
- Okay.
- Then, we take that out.

2005
01:18:29,490 --> 01:18:30,490
- Yes.
- All right?

2006
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,359
- Put in the fridge.
- Alright.

2007
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,529
(Edward Lee's tip to steam dumplings:)

2008
01:18:34,530 --> 01:18:35,699
(Before steaming, put them in the fridge for a short time...)

2009
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:36,829
(so the skin gets hard and they ripen quickly.)

2010
01:18:36,830 --> 01:18:38,630
So, what's next?

2011
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:40,169
(Makgeolli butter sauce, scallop, and abalone)

2012
01:18:40,170 --> 01:18:41,830
- Beurre blanc.
- Okay.

2013
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,999
(Dumpling sauce: Beurre blanc)

2014
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,209
He told me about the sauce called beurre blanc,

2015
01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:50,280
but honestly, I haven't heard of it before.

2016
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,909
It's a typical sauce that goes with salmon.

2017
01:18:53,910 --> 01:18:55,596
(It's a good combination with a salmon dish.)

2018
01:18:55,620 --> 01:18:59,220
It's a Western-style sauce made of white sauce.

2019
01:18:59,420 --> 01:19:02,159
It's a tasty sauce boiled down in a pan...

2020
01:19:02,160 --> 01:19:03,620
to be made.

2021
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:06,189
Instead of white wine,

2022
01:19:06,190 --> 01:19:08,959
he planned to use makgeolli.

2023
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:11,930
At first, I couldn't guess the taste.

2024
01:19:12,730 --> 01:19:14,330
Add butter, onions,

2025
01:19:15,540 --> 01:19:18,000
lemon juice, and makgeolli.

2026
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:21,339
(Eddie's beurre blanc sauce recipe: Add abalone and scallops and boil.)

2027
01:19:21,340 --> 01:19:24,380
Then boil it slowly.

2028
01:19:24,610 --> 01:19:25,879
After that, I tasted it.

2029
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,780
(What will the sauce based on makgeolli be like?)

2030
01:19:29,350 --> 01:19:31,220
- So good.
- It's so tasty.

2031
01:19:32,350 --> 01:19:34,550
I thought, "Did I really make this?"

2032
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:37,790
It was a fine-dining level.

2033
01:19:37,990 --> 01:19:39,859
- What's this?
- I was surprised too.

2034
01:19:39,860 --> 01:19:41,360
How have I made this amazing sauce?

2035
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,159
Thanks to Chef, I've made something amazing.

2036
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:47,470
This is crazy.

2037
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:51,039
I add sea urchin roe here.

2038
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,710
(Eddie is adding something more.)

2039
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,209
Just a little bit.

2040
01:19:56,210 --> 01:19:57,279
(Eddie's beurre blanc sauce recipe 3:)

2041
01:19:57,280 --> 01:19:59,040
(Add sea urchin roe and boil it for a long.)

2042
01:19:59,980 --> 01:20:03,820
(Eddie planned and A Sung made it. The beurre blanc sauce is complete.)

2043
01:20:04,080 --> 01:20:05,890
If you want to bring the sauce to here...

2044
01:20:06,250 --> 01:20:09,320
(Here goes the sauce.)

2045
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:12,789
So, we're going to do this.

2046
01:20:12,790 --> 01:20:16,129
(He adds the sauce to the plated dumplings.)

2047
01:20:16,130 --> 01:20:18,259
Oh, my goodness. This looks really good.

2048
01:20:18,260 --> 01:20:19,530
Yes, right.

2049
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:24,340
And then, I want you to get it fancy and pretty.

2050
01:20:24,970 --> 01:20:27,410
- So, have little more...
- It's so good!

2051
01:20:27,510 --> 01:20:28,669
(He adds sea urchin roe, and the abalone dumpling is complete.)

2052
01:20:28,670 --> 01:20:29,740
It's finally done!

2053
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,250
That sea urchin roe looks so yummy!

2054
01:20:34,580 --> 01:20:35,619
Okay.

2055
01:20:35,620 --> 01:20:36,620
(Now is the time for plating.)

2056
01:20:36,621 --> 01:20:39,120
All right. We are getting close, guys.

2057
01:20:41,850 --> 01:20:43,390
Our last dish was...

2058
01:20:43,490 --> 01:20:46,490
a story made by us.

2059
01:20:47,160 --> 01:20:48,930
It's not just cooking.

2060
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:50,530
We remember the process.

2061
01:20:50,860 --> 01:20:53,200
I think Eddie expressed what he felt.

2062
01:21:01,740 --> 01:21:03,910
As the dish goes to the final step,

2063
01:21:04,680 --> 01:21:07,180
we start to see the shape.

2064
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:13,119
I was on the spot, cooking together.

2065
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:14,420
But I didn't want to finish it.

2066
01:21:15,620 --> 01:21:17,660
I was afraid our journey would end here.

2067
01:21:18,190 --> 01:21:19,870
So, I tried to finish as late as possible.

2068
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:27,300
(The artwork of Eddie and the 3 Country members)

2069

2071

2072
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,880
(Si A's 7-layer rice cake)

2073
01:21:48,790 --> 01:21:52,360
(The next dish is made in memory of Yeosu.)

2074
01:21:54,030 --> 01:21:56,600
(A Sung's mugwort abalone dumpling)

2075
01:21:57,930 --> 01:22:03,100
(Buckwheat noodles and pollack from Gangwon Province)

(Yo Han's tuna eel buckwheat noodles)

2077
01:22:08,540 --> 01:22:13,080
(The Country members' final 3-course dish is complete.)

2078
01:22:13,110 --> 01:22:15,349
I'm ecstatic now.

2079
01:22:15,350 --> 01:22:16,350
Are you ready?

2080
01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:18,279
- Guys, - Yes?

2081
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:21,119
- you've worked so hard. Good job!
- Nice!

2082
01:22:21,120 --> 01:22:22,249
(Country members tried hard for their last meals.)

2083
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:23,260
It's beautiful.

2084
01:22:24,060 --> 01:22:26,290
We've got close to each other.

2085
01:22:26,660 --> 01:22:29,360
I'm glad we became good friends.

2086
01:22:29,630 --> 01:22:32,130
Please enjoy it.

2087
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:33,530
- Thanks.
- Yes.

2088
01:22:34,000 --> 01:22:36,340
So, I'm going to talk a little bit about the food.

2089
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:38,040
- When we traveled...
- Yes.

2090
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:41,070
For the first time,

2091
01:22:41,870 --> 01:22:43,540
we tried so many different foods.

2092
01:22:43,810 --> 01:22:46,150
And we met a lot of people as well.

2093
01:22:46,550 --> 01:22:49,719
We were all over the place,

2094
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:50,920
so things were mixed together.

2095
01:22:51,220 --> 01:22:52,690
So, it's hard to say...

2096
01:22:53,650 --> 01:22:56,759
this is Andong and that is Yeosu.

2097
01:22:56,760 --> 01:22:59,560
Everything is mingled in my brain.

2098
01:23:00,230 --> 01:23:01,490
I made something.

2099
01:23:03,530 --> 01:23:06,729
(Knowing a variety of ingredients and meeting precious people)

2100
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:08,330
I think it's been a long journey...

2101
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:11,269
and lots of experiences.

2102
01:23:11,270 --> 01:23:12,939
(The time gave Eddie an inspiration.)

2103
01:23:12,940 --> 01:23:15,539
So these are more special than the other ones.

2104
01:23:15,540 --> 01:23:18,680
So, it's a kind of celebratory dish.

2105
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,249
(From Gangwon Province to Andong to Yeosu)

2106
01:23:21,250 --> 01:23:23,880
(The 15-day journey made the Country members' memory dish.)

2107
01:23:24,180 --> 01:23:27,289
So, I think we should start with Yo Han.

2108
01:23:27,290 --> 01:23:28,749
- Yes.
- Oh, from this one.

2109
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:29,896
(His words make him nervous.)

2110
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:32,119
Okay. This is Yo Han's dish.

2111
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:34,429
(They will taste Yo Han's buckwheat noodles first.)

2112
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:37,930
This is buckwheat noodles,

2113
01:23:38,900 --> 01:23:40,969
but it's also like mulnaengmyeon.

2114
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:42,669
He used dried pollack...

2115
01:23:42,670 --> 01:23:44,069
- to make the broth.
- Oh, dried pollack?

2116
01:23:44,070 --> 01:23:47,040
And tuna. The reason he used tuna is...

2117
01:23:47,970 --> 01:23:51,140
(Is there any reason he used tuna?)

2118
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:53,080
Because I love it.

2119
01:23:53,850 --> 01:23:55,550
- Oh, this is tuna?
- Yes, it is.

2120
01:23:56,650 --> 01:23:59,790
(He added a generous amount of tuna as he loved it.)

2121
01:24:01,050 --> 01:24:04,920
(Buckwheat noodles embracing tuna and eel are always good.)

2122
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:08,090
Anyway, let's judge.

2123
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:10,030
Let's go.

2124
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:12,699
- Shall we judge?
- Yes.

2125
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:14,030
Taste both eel and tuna.

2126
01:24:14,130 --> 01:24:15,630
Okay. Eel and...

2127
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:19,070
- tuna...
- It looks so good.

2128
01:24:20,770 --> 01:24:21,810
Can we really try this?

2129
01:24:23,010 --> 01:24:25,580
They say eyes also taste.

2130
01:24:25,950 --> 01:24:27,810
As soon as we see it, it already looks good.

2131
01:24:28,080 --> 01:24:29,249
It looks so delicious.

2132
01:24:29,250 --> 01:24:31,649
(The dish attracts them even before tasting it.)

2133
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:32,750
It looks beautiful.

2134
01:24:32,850 --> 01:24:35,720
I'm sure it will taste so good.

2135
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,589
- Thanks for the meal!
- Thanks.

2136
01:24:37,590 --> 01:24:39,190
(Yo Han finally tries it too.)

2137
01:24:40,090 --> 01:24:41,890
(Surprised)

2138
01:24:42,430 --> 01:24:44,260
(What's that sound?)

2139
01:24:46,330 --> 01:24:47,330
Oh, it's good.

2140
01:24:48,530 --> 01:24:49,540
It's so good!

2141
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:51,370
You like it?

2142
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:52,910
Seriously!

2143
01:24:53,340 --> 01:24:56,840
As soon as I bite it, it strikes me hard.

2144
01:24:57,880 --> 01:24:59,360
I didn't know this would be possible.

2145
01:25:00,550 --> 01:25:02,980
All I could do was wonder. I was at a loss for words.

2146
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:06,690
If a pro chef grabs a knife, it can kill people by surprise.

2147
01:25:07,090 --> 01:25:09,519
That was so good.

2148
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:11,390
(And I made it.)

2149
01:25:11,590 --> 01:25:13,629
I am already addicted to it.

2150
01:25:13,630 --> 01:25:15,490
(That's right.)

2151
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:17,430
(Then, I'd try it too.)

2152
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:25,570
This is really amazing.

2153
01:25:25,940 --> 01:25:27,010
It's good, isn't it?

2154
01:25:28,210 --> 01:25:29,210
(The dish makes her smile.)

2155
01:25:29,211 --> 01:25:30,851
- That reaction comes naturally.
- Right.

2156
01:25:32,950 --> 01:25:34,609
If he gets serious,

2157
01:25:34,610 --> 01:25:35,730
you take us all by surprise.

2158
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:38,380
This is amazing. It's so good, Chef.

2159
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:41,349
The taste recalled...

2160
01:25:41,350 --> 01:25:44,690
our first journey to Gangwon Province.

2161
01:25:44,990 --> 01:25:47,271
The buckwheat noodles that had already become a memory...

2162
01:25:47,590 --> 01:25:50,729
combined with the savory broth were so good.

2163
01:25:50,730 --> 01:25:51,736
(Dried pollack made the broth light and refreshing.)

2164
01:25:51,760 --> 01:25:53,000
The broth is also amazing.

2165
01:25:53,700 --> 01:25:55,469
- People would like it a lot.
- Definitely.

2166
01:25:55,470 --> 01:25:57,640
- I should drink this.
- It makes us addicted to it.

2167
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:00,210
(Hurridely drinking the broth)

2168
01:26:01,410 --> 01:26:02,410
(It's good.)

2169
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:04,040
Nice, isn't it?

2170
01:26:04,040 --> 01:26:05,040
(I love it so much.)

2171
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:08,250
(He's drinking it too.)

2172
01:26:09,380 --> 01:26:11,450
(It's nice to see them enjoying it.)

2173
01:26:11,480 --> 01:26:13,689
Eel and tuna in cool broth.

2174
01:26:13,690 --> 01:26:15,319
There are already two types of fish.

2175
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:17,120
People think it would taste too fishy.

2176
01:26:17,590 --> 01:26:20,059
- But it's not.
- Not at all.

2177
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:23,260
(Spicy and delicious sauce covers eel and tuna.)

2178
01:26:25,730 --> 01:26:29,200
I didn't want to reveal this secret.

2179
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,900
- Hear me out.
- What's it?

2180
01:26:32,770 --> 01:26:37,040
I boiled strawberries in gochujang sauce.

2181
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:39,249
Strawberries. You didn't recognize it, right?

2182
01:26:39,250 --> 01:26:41,050
- Andong strawberries.
- Andong strawberries.

2183
01:26:41,510 --> 01:26:43,320
I saw them before.

2184
01:26:44,950 --> 01:26:47,250
That's why the sauce is somewhat sweet.

2185
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:51,320
I thought it was chogochujang. But it was more sour than that.

2186
01:26:51,690 --> 01:26:53,289
So I wondered.

2187
01:26:53,290 --> 01:26:54,889
It was strawberries.

2188
01:26:54,890 --> 01:26:56,476
(He created the maximum level of sour and sweet taste.)

2189
01:26:56,500 --> 01:26:59,570
With gochujang, I added sugar, salt, and vinegar.

2190
01:27:00,430 --> 01:27:02,330
(You didn't know that, right?)

2191
01:27:02,640 --> 01:27:04,970
- What's next?
- Shall we try dumplings?

2192
01:27:05,100 --> 01:27:06,110
Oh, my!

2193
01:27:06,440 --> 01:27:08,240
Okay. Over there.

2194
01:27:08,870 --> 01:27:11,139
The next one is dumplings.

2195
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:13,620
(Country Cook Fine-dining 2nd Dish: Mugwort abalone dumplings)

2196
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:17,579
When we took on the haenyeo's boat, we saw all kinds of seafood.

2197
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:20,420
- Yes. That's right.
- On the haenyeo's boat.

2198
01:27:20,720 --> 01:27:22,350
At that time,

2199
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:25,359
do you remember we had the mugwort ice cream?

2200
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,159
- Of course, we do.
- The one we had in Yeosu.

2201
01:27:27,160 --> 01:27:28,830
Getting to try that ice cream...

2202
01:27:29,430 --> 01:27:31,200
made me so happy.

2203
01:27:32,970 --> 01:27:36,239
(The memories they made together...)

2204
01:27:36,240 --> 01:27:39,510
(make Edward smile as soon as he recalls them.)

2205
01:27:39,770 --> 01:27:42,510
- Where did it go?
- It was really incredible to see.

2206
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:44,540
It's a really strong memory.

2207
01:27:45,680 --> 01:27:47,209
I'm getting drunk.

2208
01:27:47,210 --> 01:27:48,250
Can you fill my glass?

2209
01:27:49,080 --> 01:27:51,779
Everything that we've seen or tasted in Yeosu...

2210
01:27:51,780 --> 01:27:53,220
is in that one dish.

2211
01:27:53,920 --> 01:27:55,849
So, the dumplings to me are just like...

2212
01:27:55,850 --> 01:27:58,590
a love letter to Yeosu.

2213
01:28:01,930 --> 01:28:03,960
So there's scallop.

2214
01:28:04,330 --> 01:28:06,299
- There's scallop and shrimp.
- There's scallop...

2215
01:28:06,300 --> 01:28:08,870
Place it on the dumpling.

2216
01:28:09,640 --> 01:28:12,169
Place the sea urchin roe on the dumpling.

2217
01:28:12,170 --> 01:28:15,140
Place the sauce, abalone, and scallop on the dumpling.

2218
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:16,539
- Gosh.
- Gosh, this is...

2219
01:28:16,540 --> 01:28:17,579
(Put a lot of sea urchin roe and sauce on top of the dumplings.)

2220
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,210
- This is unreal.
- This is brilliant.

2221
01:28:20,010 --> 01:28:21,490
This combination itself is brilliant.

2222
01:28:22,110 --> 01:28:24,780
(A divine bite of food)

2223
01:28:25,650 --> 01:28:26,849
I'll try it.

2224
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:28,550
(Her spoon is full.)

2225
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:30,989
(What does the dumpling inspired by Yeosu and the sea taste like?)

2226
01:28:30,990 --> 01:28:33,159
Can you taste all the seafood inside the dumpling?

2227
01:28:33,160 --> 01:28:35,160
(Eyes open wide)

2228
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,370
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

2229
01:28:39,970 --> 01:28:41,470
(It's good, right?)

2230
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:43,899
It's so good that I'm tearing up.

2231
01:28:43,900 --> 01:28:46,910
- It's so good, right?
- It's making me tear up, Chef.

2232
01:28:47,270 --> 01:28:48,310
Gosh.

2233
01:28:50,180 --> 01:28:51,779
(A Sung, who worked hard to make this, takes a bite too.)

2234
01:28:51,780 --> 01:28:53,779
I'll eat it now.

2235
01:28:53,780 --> 01:28:56,020
(Yum)

2236
01:28:56,120 --> 01:28:59,589
When I first put it in my mouth, it tasted buttery and nutty.

2237
01:28:59,590 --> 01:29:01,820
But the more I chew, the more I taste the mugwort.

2238
01:29:01,890 --> 01:29:05,219
The bitter flavor continues.

2239
01:29:05,220 --> 01:29:07,860
When I get past the mugwort, I taste the flavor of the South Sea.

2240
01:29:08,090 --> 01:29:10,159
It makes me feel like I'm back at the South Sea with the haenyeos.

2241
01:29:10,160 --> 01:29:12,136
(It's as if their mouths are full of the South Sea.)

2242
01:29:12,160 --> 01:29:14,069
(The dumpling holds the essence of the South Sea, )

2243
01:29:14,070 --> 01:29:15,970
(where the haenyeos live.)

2244
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:18,200
- It's so good.
- It's so good.

2245
01:29:20,910 --> 01:29:26,410
(The flavor is extra special with their memories in Yeosu.)

2246
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:29,979
Our first dumplings...

2247
01:29:29,980 --> 01:29:33,850
(The dumplings taste extra good as she thinks about the haenyeos.)

2248
01:29:34,850 --> 01:29:37,160
- Dive in.
- Me?

2249
01:29:37,420 --> 01:29:38,989
And then...

2250
01:29:38,990 --> 01:29:40,989
(I know I made it, but it's so good.)

2251
01:29:40,990 --> 01:29:42,999
Since we used makgeolli,

2252
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:44,700
the sauce tasted extra nutty,

2253
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,169
and I could tell that...

2254
01:29:47,170 --> 01:29:49,900
it was perfect for the dumplings.

2255
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:53,110
You did such a good job with the dough.

2256
01:29:53,210 --> 01:29:54,510
Beautiful.

2257
01:29:54,740 --> 01:29:57,510
The dumpling skin.

2258
01:29:57,810 --> 01:29:59,409
You did a great job with it.

2259
01:29:59,410 --> 01:30:00,579
- Thank you.
- The thickness is perfect.

2260
01:30:00,580 --> 01:30:02,379
If they're too thick,

2261
01:30:02,380 --> 01:30:03,700
- Right.
- they don't taste good.

2262
01:30:03,920 --> 01:30:04,980
This is perfect.

2263
01:30:05,050 --> 01:30:06,719
And if they're too thin,

2264
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,090
- they tear and burst.
- Right.

2265
01:30:08,320 --> 01:30:10,790
You're the master of dumplings. Seriously.

2266
01:30:10,990 --> 01:30:12,020
These are so good.

2267
01:30:12,090 --> 01:30:14,489
(Let me eat my buckwheat noodles.)

2268
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:16,799
You did such a good job with the dough.

2269
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,299
He loves dumplings so much...

2270
01:30:19,300 --> 01:30:20,730
that I was a little worried.

2271
01:30:21,030 --> 01:30:22,970
I didn't want to disappoint you.

2272
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:25,770
(Eddie takes one last bite!)

2273
01:30:26,140 --> 01:30:28,810
(A Sung's mugwort abalone dumpling was a huge success.)

2274
01:30:28,940 --> 01:30:29,940
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

2275
01:30:29,941 --> 01:30:30,979
- Yes.
- Yes.

2276
01:30:30,980 --> 01:30:32,656
(Now, it's time for the long-awaited last dish.)

2277
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:34,950
- And then, finally, - Yes.

2278
01:30:35,280 --> 01:30:38,650
The seven-layer rice cake.

2279
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:41,290
This is the secret trick. You ready?

2280
01:30:41,720 --> 01:30:43,220
Galbijjim broth.

2281
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,589
(He's going to pour the sauce over the rice cake?)

2282
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:46,829
- I boiled it down...
- Okay.

2283
01:30:46,830 --> 01:30:48,960
And added some butter to it. So...

2284
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:50,230
on top.

2285
01:30:50,600 --> 01:30:51,999
Gosh, that looks amazing.

2286
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,799
(It's like icing on the cake.)

2287
01:30:54,800 --> 01:30:56,870
There's no way this doesn't taste good.

2288
01:30:57,098 --> 01:30:58,568
Galbijjim broth.

2289
01:30:59,738 --> 01:31:01,037
(He's going to pour the sauce over the rice cake?)

2290
01:31:01,038 --> 01:31:02,307
- I boiled it down...
- Okay.

2291
01:31:02,308 --> 01:31:04,378
And added some butter to it. So...

2292
01:31:04,538 --> 01:31:05,578
on top.

2293
01:31:06,038 --> 01:31:07,507
Gosh, that looks amazing.

2294
01:31:07,508 --> 01:31:10,247
(It's like icing on the cake.)

2295
01:31:10,248 --> 01:31:12,278
There's no way this doesn't taste good.

2296
01:31:12,748 --> 01:31:13,918
Everywhere.

2297
01:31:14,018 --> 01:31:16,757
(He's pouring the deliciousness all over.)

2298
01:31:16,758 --> 01:31:17,788
Okay.

2299
01:31:19,418 --> 01:31:20,727
You do it. Now you have to...

2300
01:31:20,728 --> 01:31:22,058
(Smash it with a spoon.)

2301
01:31:22,288 --> 01:31:23,604
- Like that.
- He wants you to smash it.

2302
01:31:23,628 --> 01:31:24,728
- Smash it?
- Yes.

2303
01:31:28,898 --> 01:31:30,238
Gosh.

2304
01:31:30,938 --> 01:31:35,768
(The moist but crispy texture is visible to the eye.)

2305
01:31:37,078 --> 01:31:38,578
You don't have to mix it.

2306
01:31:38,708 --> 01:31:40,108
We made layers.

2307
01:31:40,478 --> 01:31:42,947
- This is one layer.
- Make sure you get the steak.

2308
01:31:42,948 --> 01:31:44,717
Here's your steak.

2309
01:31:44,718 --> 01:31:45,747
Gosh.

2310
01:31:45,748 --> 01:31:49,118
I think I'm going to love how this tastes.

2311
01:31:49,418 --> 01:31:52,187
This looks like a royal meal...

2312
01:31:52,188 --> 01:31:54,358
- that kings used to eat.
- A royal meal.

2313
01:31:54,388 --> 01:31:56,598
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

2314
01:31:57,198 --> 01:31:58,398
Thank you for the food, Si A.

2315
01:31:58,458 --> 01:32:00,428
- Thank you for the food.
- Go ahead and try it.

2316
01:32:00,528 --> 01:32:02,567
You turned a crisis into an opportunity, Si A.

2317
01:32:02,568 --> 01:32:03,798
The crisis...

2318
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:06,468
I didn't do anything. Chef Lee used his bare hands...

2319
01:32:06,638 --> 01:32:08,938
to bring it back to life.

2320
01:32:09,978 --> 01:32:12,277
(Let's try Si A's rice cake.)

2321
01:32:12,278 --> 01:32:13,408
It's so good.

2322
01:32:13,578 --> 01:32:15,177
(As soon as she takes a huge bite)

2323
01:32:15,178 --> 01:32:16,348
It's so good.

2324
01:32:18,018 --> 01:32:19,378
Nothing can beat rice.

2325
01:32:19,478 --> 01:32:20,718
Rice is the best.

2326
01:32:22,018 --> 01:32:25,058
(Si A finally gets to taste the food that she made.)

2327
01:32:27,158 --> 01:32:28,327
It's so good.

2328
01:32:28,328 --> 01:32:30,298
Gosh, it's really good.

2329
01:32:32,858 --> 01:32:34,168
It was amazing.

2330
01:32:34,628 --> 01:32:37,337
In a way, the flavor is very familiar.

2331
01:32:37,338 --> 01:32:40,168
People usually eat galbijjim with vegetables...

2332
01:32:40,908 --> 01:32:43,107
and kimchi mixed together.

2333
01:32:43,108 --> 01:32:45,608
But this had the galbijjim butter sauce...

2334
01:32:46,378 --> 01:32:49,007
and the nurungji on the outside.

2335
01:32:49,008 --> 01:32:50,724
(Sweet galbijjim sauce and crispy nurungji)

2336
01:32:50,748 --> 01:32:53,818
The combination of those ingredients...

2337
01:32:54,018 --> 01:32:56,918
made the familiar texture, taste, and flavor...

2338
01:32:56,988 --> 01:32:58,618
feel brand new.

2339
01:32:59,928 --> 01:33:02,057
It felt very unique.

2340
01:33:02,058 --> 01:33:04,978
(Remember. A familiar taste combined with Eddie's inspiration is divine.)

2341
01:33:08,828 --> 01:33:11,498
(It's so good that Si A's about to pass out.)

2342
01:33:11,798 --> 01:33:13,707
- Goodness.
- All of the food that...

2343
01:33:13,708 --> 01:33:15,767
Eddie made for us so far was good.

2344
01:33:15,768 --> 01:33:16,838
- Yes.
- Yes.

2345
01:33:17,008 --> 01:33:19,178
They were all undoubtedly good,

2346
01:33:19,508 --> 01:33:21,377
and this one is also good.

2347
01:33:21,378 --> 01:33:22,708
It's the best one yet.

2348
01:33:24,678 --> 01:33:27,087
This could have been too heavy...

2349
01:33:27,088 --> 01:33:28,764
- because there's only galbijjim.
- Right.

2350
01:33:28,788 --> 01:33:31,257
But the spiciness of the leaf mustard kimchi...

2351
01:33:31,258 --> 01:33:33,487
balances the flavor out and ties everything together.

2352
01:33:33,488 --> 01:33:35,358
It acts like Korean mustard.

2353
01:33:36,698 --> 01:33:38,897
(The best way to express a good taste is to keep eating.)

2354
01:33:38,898 --> 01:33:40,228
It's so good.

2355
01:33:40,828 --> 01:33:41,967
It's crispy on the outside...

2356
01:33:41,968 --> 01:33:43,267
- Yes.
- and moist on the inside.

2357
01:33:43,268 --> 01:33:45,397
All these textures go well together as I chew.

2358
01:33:45,398 --> 01:33:48,108
What I think is amazing is that this dish starts with...

2359
01:33:48,168 --> 01:33:50,408
beef from Gangwon Province...

2360
01:33:50,738 --> 01:33:52,638
and ends with leaf mustard kimchi from Yeosu.

2361
01:33:54,278 --> 01:33:56,347
This dish has everything.

2362
01:33:56,348 --> 01:33:58,378
Our entire journey is in this dish.

2363
01:33:59,518 --> 01:34:01,888
(I'm so proud.)

2364
01:34:01,988 --> 01:34:05,118
I don't know. To me, this dish is like...

2365
01:34:05,358 --> 01:34:06,988
several grandmothers.

2366
01:34:07,258 --> 01:34:08,887
You dedicated this dish to the grandmothers.

2367
01:34:08,888 --> 01:34:11,257
Like a tribute to the grandmothers.

2368
01:34:11,258 --> 01:34:12,727
(The grandmothers who showed them how to cook)

2369
01:34:12,728 --> 01:34:15,668
It's as if the grandmothers we met all participated in this dish.

2370
01:34:17,038 --> 01:34:20,768
(The meaning behind the 7-layer rice cake)

2371
01:34:20,908 --> 01:34:22,838
There were seven layers of rice.

2372
01:34:23,408 --> 01:34:25,477
Eddie said they represented the seven...

2373
01:34:25,478 --> 01:34:28,178
grandmothers that he had met.

2374
01:34:28,848 --> 01:34:31,818
(Each layer holds memories with a grandmother.)

2375
01:34:31,918 --> 01:34:33,847
The master I met.

2376
01:34:33,848 --> 01:34:34,887
(The 1st layer represents the master of buckwheat...)

2377
01:34:34,888 --> 01:34:36,688
(from Gangwon Province who had a fun accent.)

2378
01:34:36,758 --> 01:34:39,687
The woman who made the seasoned vegetables.

2379
01:34:39,688 --> 01:34:41,357
(The 2nd layer represents the master of seasoned vegetables...)

2380
01:34:41,358 --> 01:34:43,028
(with whom they exchanged cookings with.)

2381
01:34:44,328 --> 01:34:47,567
And grandmothers at Meju Village, who were masters of fermentation.

2382
01:34:47,568 --> 01:34:49,097
(The 3rd layer represents the warm-hearted grandmothers...)

2383
01:34:49,098 --> 01:34:50,598
(at Yecheon Meju Village.)

2384
01:34:50,998 --> 01:34:52,237
And then, the leaf mustard grandmother.

2385
01:34:52,238 --> 01:34:53,807
(The 4th layer represents Ms. Park Chun Hwa, )

2386
01:34:53,808 --> 01:34:56,084
(who plows 6,600m² of leaf mustard field all by herself.)

2387
01:34:56,108 --> 01:34:57,407
Each of the masters...

2388
01:34:57,408 --> 01:34:59,037
and store owners...

2389
01:34:59,038 --> 01:35:00,577
(The 5th layer represents the Gangneung sandlance family.)

2390
01:35:00,578 --> 01:35:02,578
(The 6th layer represents the Andong head family.)

2391
01:35:03,918 --> 01:35:05,247
And the haenyeos.

2392
01:35:05,248 --> 01:35:07,888
(The 7th layer represents the haenyeos of the Yeosu sea.)

2393
01:35:08,318 --> 01:35:09,858
It felt as if each of the layers...

2394
01:35:10,558 --> 01:35:12,757
was carefully stacked while remembering...

2395
01:35:12,758 --> 01:35:14,588
our memories with them.

2396
01:35:14,788 --> 01:35:16,927
I think this final dish was completed...

2397
01:35:16,928 --> 01:35:19,298
with every single one of the memories we made here.

2398
01:35:19,628 --> 01:35:21,297
I feel like these dishes...

2399
01:35:21,298 --> 01:35:24,468
are like the materialization of the photos that...

2400
01:35:24,538 --> 01:35:26,507
you took with your mind.

2401
01:35:26,508 --> 01:35:28,407
- That's what I thought.
- Yes, my version of photos.

2402
01:35:28,408 --> 01:35:30,877
Yes, your version of photos.

2403
01:35:30,878 --> 01:35:33,547
Our entire trip is on this table.

2404
01:35:33,548 --> 01:35:35,947
So this reminds me of all the memories we made...

2405
01:35:35,948 --> 01:35:37,877
- and all the people we met.
- Right.

2406
01:35:37,878 --> 01:35:40,159
(Their journey of exploring Korean cooking is expressed.)

2407
01:35:41,418 --> 01:35:43,687
When I was young, I felt like I was 90 percent American...

2408
01:35:43,688 --> 01:35:44,988
and 10 percent Korean.

2409
01:35:45,488 --> 01:35:47,858
I feel like, at the end of this trip,

2410
01:35:48,188 --> 01:35:51,157
maybe I'm like 70 percent Korean and 30 percent American.

2411
01:35:51,158 --> 01:35:52,158
I don't know.

2412
01:35:52,928 --> 01:35:54,797
Hey, you can't do that.

2413
01:35:54,798 --> 01:35:56,667
(Through this trip, Eddie was able to fill himself...)

2414
01:35:56,668 --> 01:35:58,497
(with the flavors of the grandmothers' cooking.)

2415
01:35:58,498 --> 01:36:00,867
- This tastes even better.
- Does it?

2416
01:36:00,868 --> 01:36:02,667
My friends keep joking. They're like,

2417
01:36:02,668 --> 01:36:06,378
"You're Korean now. You eat like a Korean."

2418
01:36:06,508 --> 01:36:08,177
Chef, I see you know how to enjoy your food.

2419
01:36:08,178 --> 01:36:09,948
It makes me feel good.

2420
01:36:10,178 --> 01:36:12,618
I do feel closer to Korea.

2421
01:36:13,488 --> 01:36:17,318
That ultimately is the reason why I'm here.

2422
01:36:18,288 --> 01:36:21,328
When I was on "Culinary Class Wars,"

2423
01:36:22,928 --> 01:36:25,498
I met Korean chefs...

2424
01:36:26,198 --> 01:36:29,068
and I saw a new way of Korean food.

2425
01:36:30,268 --> 01:36:33,908
But through this trip, meeting grandmothers from the countryside,

2426
01:36:34,308 --> 01:36:37,208
my perception of Korean food changed once again.

2427
01:36:37,408 --> 01:36:39,177
I thought, "This is real Korean food."

2428
01:36:39,178 --> 01:36:40,208
Yes, the origin.

2429
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:41,708
Original Korean food.

2430
01:36:41,848 --> 01:36:43,678
We're Korean too,

2431
01:36:44,378 --> 01:36:45,754
but we didn't know much about it either.

2432
01:36:45,778 --> 01:36:49,147
Thanks to you, we got to travel...

2433
01:36:49,148 --> 01:36:51,357
and learn more about Korean food, ourselves.

2434
01:36:51,358 --> 01:36:52,358
Yes.

2435
01:36:53,388 --> 01:36:54,528
It's important.

2436
01:36:55,688 --> 01:36:57,197
Really, thank you so much...

2437
01:36:57,198 --> 01:36:58,657
- for helping me.
- Thank you.

2438
01:36:58,658 --> 01:37:00,297
Even the skate.

2439
01:37:00,298 --> 01:37:01,468
I thank you.

2440
01:37:01,628 --> 01:37:03,167
Even the skate. Thank you.

2441
01:37:03,168 --> 01:37:04,544
(I see you haven't let that go, Kyun.)

2442
01:37:04,568 --> 01:37:05,598
I'm sorry.

2443
01:37:06,038 --> 01:37:08,508
- No.
- No, that was nice too.

2444
01:37:08,668 --> 01:37:10,678
Yes, it was nice.

2445
01:37:12,408 --> 01:37:13,408
Gosh, that's funny.

2446
01:37:13,409 --> 01:37:16,208
In the beginning, we were quite awkward. But now,

2447
01:37:16,718 --> 01:37:18,347
I can't help but laugh whenever we make eye contact.

2448
01:37:18,348 --> 01:37:19,578
It's so funny.

2449
01:37:19,778 --> 01:37:21,817
- I...
- Just by looking at Eddie's eyes.

2450
01:37:21,818 --> 01:37:22,888
It's so funny.

2451
01:37:26,828 --> 01:37:30,458
The food I didn't get to eat because I wasn't here the first day.

2452
01:37:31,458 --> 01:37:32,757
I got to make it with Kyun,

2453
01:37:32,758 --> 01:37:35,368
and it felt like we were making up for the time that I missed.

2454
01:37:36,168 --> 01:37:38,538
I appreciated it so much. It was very meaningful.

2455
01:37:39,638 --> 01:37:42,808
I used to hate using fruit in dishes.

2456
01:37:42,938 --> 01:37:47,778
But I think Chef Lee helped me think outside the box.

2457
01:37:48,248 --> 01:37:50,147
He tells us that whether we fail or succeed,

2458
01:37:50,148 --> 01:37:51,878
both are part of the process.

2459
01:37:52,118 --> 01:37:55,118
I think I've learned to enjoy that process in cooking.

2460
01:37:55,448 --> 01:37:56,617
This one was special...

2461
01:37:56,618 --> 01:38:00,128
because we all did it together as a team.

2462
01:38:00,658 --> 01:38:04,957
I think it's been a lovely time getting to know you.

2463
01:38:04,958 --> 01:38:06,274
(Friendships were made through this trip.)

2464
01:38:06,298 --> 01:38:09,397
And hopefully, we'll stay friends forever.

2465
01:38:09,398 --> 01:38:11,468
(I hope we'll stay friends forever.)

2466
01:38:12,868 --> 01:38:14,337
- Are you crying?
- No.

2467
01:38:14,338 --> 01:38:15,468
Are you crying?

2468
01:38:16,808 --> 01:38:21,108
(Edward Lee traveled Korea in search of traditional Korean food.)

2469
01:38:26,988 --> 01:38:29,047
(The Country members made good memories together...)

2470
01:38:29,048 --> 01:38:31,018
(as they learned, laughed, and tasted food.)

2471
01:38:33,118 --> 01:38:34,558
I don't think I'll ever forget this.

2472
01:38:35,388 --> 01:38:36,858
I'll keep remembering our memories.

2473
01:38:37,258 --> 01:38:38,397
Let's cherish this.

2474
01:38:38,398 --> 01:38:39,898
(Let's cherish this.)
